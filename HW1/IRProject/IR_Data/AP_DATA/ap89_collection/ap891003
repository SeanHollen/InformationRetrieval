<HEAD>Brom Convicted of First-Degree Murder for Family Ax Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager accused of killing his
parents and younger brother and sister with an ax was found guilty
on Tuesday, his 18th birthday, of four counts of first-degree
murder.
   David Brom, tried as an adult, had pleaded innocent by reason of
mental illness. The Olmsted County District Court jury deliberated
about four hours and 45 minutes before returning the guilty
verdicts.
   Brom showed no emotion as the verdict was read shortly after 9
p.m.
   He was charged with four counts each of first- and second-degree
murder in the February 1988 slayings. The first-degree murder
convictions mean that jurors believe the slayings were premeditated.
   The trial will move to a second phase Thursday to determine
whether Brom was mentally ill at the time and therefore not
responsible for his actions.
   ``Obviously, coming in we knew that phase one was not the strong
part of the case for us,''
   Defense attorney Terrence Walters had agreed that Brom committed
the murders but argued that they were not premeditated, said the
defense would show that Brom ``is and was mentally ill.''
   If Brom is found to have been sane when the murders occurred, he
faces a life imprisonment sentence with no chance of parole for 17{
years on each of the four counts.
   Bernard Brom, 41, suffered 22 ax wounds in the slayings at the
Broms' rural Rochester home; Paulette, 41, suffered 18 wounds;
13-year-old Diane had eight wounds and 11-year-old Ricky had nine,
Dr. Kathryn Berg testified Tuesday.
   Olmsted County Attorney Ray Schmitz in his closing argument said
the number of times each victim was struck by the ax could in
itself be enough to prove premeditation.
   The prosecutor also reminded jurors that Brom had many
conversations with friends in the months before the murders in
which he discussed killing his family. Brom did not testify.
   Walters argued that Brom's discussions with friends were fantasy.
   ``The `plan' consisted of a series of disjointed, illogical,
fantasy-like thoughts, flitting in and out of the mind of Dave Brom
intermixed with thoughts of suicide,'' Walters said.

   A Democratic state senator and a
Republican political aide forced each other into a congressional
runoff Tuesday, capturing the top two spots in a special election
to fill the seat of the late Rep. Larkin Smith.
   Democrat Gene Taylor and Republican Tom Anderson easily took the
top two spots in the three-way race, leaving a stunned state
Attorney General Mike Moore trailing by more than 15,000 votes.
   The special election was scheduled after Smith died in a plane
crash Aug. 13. Taylor and Anderson will face each other in an Oct.
17 runoff.
   Democrats have been hoping to strip the GOP of a seat it has
held for more than 16 years.
   Unofficials returns showed Taylor with 51,383 votes, or 42
percent, Anderson with 45,623, or 37 percent, and Moore with
24,497, or 21 percent.
   Taylor, 36, who ran unsuccessfully for the same seat in 1988,
surprised the better-known Moore, who finished third in the home
county where he was district attorney for 12 years.
   ``We felt all along that we charted a course down the middle
that if there was a runoff we would be favored by each side,''
Taylor said. ``There were a lot more people who voted Democratic
than Republican.''
   Moore, 37, who was criticized for wanting to leave the attorney
general's office after only 21 months in office, said he would
support Taylor in the runoff.
   Anderson, 45, a longtime aide to U.S. Sen. Trent Lott, said his
campaign had ``come from nowhere to be here tonight.'' He promised
his supporters ``two weeks of excitment.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush declared Tuesday that the
attempted coup against Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was not
``some American operation,'' and he wants ``to see democracy in
Panama succeed.''
   Bush's spokesman said the government would continue seeking
Noriega's ouster.
   ``Nothing's changed. Everything remains the same. We'll continue
to press for Noriega's removal'' and his arrest to stand trial in
the United States on drug charges, said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Late Tuesday, after a day of sorting out conflicting reports on
the coup attempt, Fitzwater said U.S. officials had determined it
had failed. Soon after, Noriega's officials claimed victory in
Panama City.
   Though the overthrow attempt, by members of the Panamanian
Defense Forces, failed after a morning gun battle at the forces'
headquarters, Fitzwater said the attempt ``shows the opposition to
Noriega within Panama. It shows there is a strong faction at least
within the PDF (Panamanian Defense Forces) that felt he should be
removed.''
   ``We did not take any action that would have constituted direct
involvement,'' said Fitzwater. ``We had helicopters that were in
the air observing and we had some troops around one of the
causeways there to protect access and rights and so forth.''
   Bush himself told reporters emphatically, ``There were rumors
around that this was some American operation and I can tell you
that is not true.''
   Greeting Mexican President Carlos Salinas De Gortari for a State
dinner at the White House, Bush was asked if he were disappointed
that the coup failed. Bush stated emphatically, ``I want to see
democracy in Panama succeed.''
   Tuesday night, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., introduced legislation
authorizing the president to use the armed forces to remove Noriega
from power and bring him to the United States.
   The president, meanwhile, refused to speculate on whether he
should have used the military to intervene.
   ``I know the facts and some of the critics don't,'' Bush said in
response to questions at the White House dinner.
   The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee for not making
it a U.S. operation _ for not sending U.S. troops to help the
insurgents.
   ``Here you have brave people in Panama ... trying to rid
themselves of a drug dealer and a thug who's taken over their
country,'' said the chairman, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., after an
hour-long classified briefing from CIA officials.
   ``And for the United States, with all of our strength and force
and all of our belief in democracy, to stand by _ two miles away as
the crow flies _ and do nothing, and allow these people to fail,
personally I think is wrong.''
   But according to an article in Wednesday editions of the Star
Tribune of Minneapolis, it was opposition from Boren a year ago
that defeated a plan approved by President Reagan to finance, train
and supported disaffected Panamanian officers in an attempt to
overthrow Noriega.
   Boren objected that the effort was too close to the election,
might amount to authorizing assassination and might result in the
deaths of many Americans, according to the Star Tribune's account
quoting unidentified ``well-placed'' sources.
   Fitzwater said a State Department official, Bernard Aronson,
informed Bush after the president met with the visiting Soviet
defense minister that Noriega's forces appeared to be prevailing.
   ``He just said `OK,' and went into another meeting,'' said
Fitzwater.
   The spokesman said visiting Mexico President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari. in a meeting earlier Tuesday with Bush had ``emphasized
the integrity of the various countries in Central America, and we
have respected that integrity and have not intervened.''
   The Bush administration, like the Reagan administration before
it, has called repeatedly for Noriega's ouster.
   Bush, speaking to reporters before the outcome in Panama City
was clear, appeared intent on influencing the situation in Panama
in favor of the insurrectionists.
   Asserting that he hoped his words would be ``conveyed
instantly'' to Panama, Bush said, ``We have no argument with the
Panamanian Defense Forces. We've had good relations with the
Panamanian Defense Forces.
   ``Our argument has been, as have many other countries, with Mr.
Noriega who aborted the democratic will of the people of Panama.
And that's where our argument was and that's where our argument
is.''
   Last May, Bush had told reporters, ``I would love to see them
get him out.''
   Asked then if he were calling for the Panamanian Defense Forces
to overthrow Noriega, Bush replied, ``We'd like to see him out of
there, not just the PDF, the will of the people of Panama. ... I
would add no words of caution. The will of the people should be
implemented.''
   Fitzwater acknowledged that the United States had some advance
word that a coup attempt might be afoot but said he was unaware of
Noriega's fate or even his whereabouts.
   ``We had some indications this sort of thing was in the works,
but until it happens, you never know,'' Fitzwater said. He
characterized the prior information as ``rumblings.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United States
would move quickly toward normalizing relations with Panama if
Noriega is deposed but added that any such step would be impossible
so long as Noriega remains in power.
   After Noriega was indicted by two Florida grand juries on drug
smuggling charges in February 1988, the Reagan administration
imposed a series of economic sanctions in a bid to oust the
general, who is commander of Panama's military forces.
   Among other actions, the administration froze all Panamanian
assets in the United States. For the past 19 months, the United
States has not recognized the Noriega-led government as the legal
authority in Panama.
   Fitzwater said Bush was first alerted about the gunfire by
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft shortly before the
president met with Mexican President Salinas.
   Then, Scowcroft gave a briefing to both Bush and Salinas
jointly, although details in late morning remained sketchy,
Fitzwater said.
   About 50,000 Americans live in Panama, including more than
12,000 U.S. military personnel attached to the U.S. Southern
Command.
   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said
American citizens living in Panama were being asked to stay at home.
   The U.S. Southern Command put its troops and civilians on the
isthmus on Delta Alert, its highest level of readiness. American
troops in combat gear took up positions 600 yards from the barracks
in downtown Panama City.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said U.S. troops in Panama were
not involved in any way in the disturbance. He added, ``Our
facilities down there are locked up; they are secure.''
   The American military personnel in Panama have been ordered to
stay put and not to travel on roads outside the U.S.-owned
facilities, Williams said.
   The headquarters of the Defense Forces command is about one-half
mile from the scene of the shooting and mortar fire, officials said.

   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov conferred
with President Bush on Tuesday on the prospects for reducing
nuclear and conventional arms and assured the American people they
need not fear the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet defense minister was kept waiting a half hour as Bush
got a briefing from national security adviser Brent Scowcroft on
the attempted coup in Panama.
   The president was informed after the Oval Office session with
Yazov that the attempt to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
apparently had failed.
   Bush broke his usual practice of refusing to answer questions
during photo opportunities by telling reporters the fighting in
Panama was not ``some American operation.''
   The president asked Yazov to ``pay my respects to President
Gorbachev,'' and said the recent talks with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze were ``very fruitful.''
   ``We are satisfied. We've got some problems still,'' Bush said,
but ``things are moving in the direction we wanted.''
   Yazov, emerging 30 minutes later, offered his own rosy
assessment of the outlook for arms control.
   The burly, beribboned general told reporters:
   ``The main point of my discussions with the U.S. president was
the question of arms control, the question of reducing conventional
armed forces and weapons and the question of promoting a
relationship between our two militaries and our two nations.''
   Speaking in Russian, Yazov said: ``The Soviet people are
cherishing the best sentiments and feeling towards the Americans.
We were comrades at arms during the Second World War and we
succeeded in winning a great victory. And now we have no grounds,
no reason whatsoever, to go into confrontation (against) each
other.''
   Asked if this meeting had furthered the prospects for an arms
pact, Yazov smiled and said, ``Well, I don't think I could really
assure success at the negotiations within half an hour.''
   But he added, ``Our negotiating teams are working in Geneva. I
think we are moving forward step by step to the ultimate conclusion
of agreements on the questions. Anyhow, we are counting on
progress.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said afterward Bush
had ``reiterated his support for perestroika,'' the Soviet process
of reorganization into a more open society, and ``expressed his
desire to conclude agreements on conventional forces in Europe and
on chemical weapons as soon as possible and his hopes for progress
in START,'' the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.
   If Yazov was perturbed at being kept waiting and having events
in Panama intrude on the Oval Office meeting, he did not show it.
   Asked if the Soviet Union favored the removal of Noriega from
power, Yazov said, ``I am not prepared to talk on the issue because
I am not aware of what happened in Panama. ... We have not talked
about it at all. I can't tell you anything more.''
   Yazov said he and Cheney were hoping to reach agreements on
several steps to improve the rapidly warming relations between the
leadership of the Soviet and American armed forces.
   ``We are thinking of expanding our exchanges in the military
field next year and we are going to draft a whole program which
will be designed to promote better understanding between our two
militaries and between our peoples,'' he said.
   Earlier, Cheney took Yazov to Gettysburg, Pa., about 62 miles
north of Washington to see the battlefield where Union troops
repulsed Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederate soldiers in a bloody
three-day battle in July 1863 that marked one of the turning points
in the American Civil War. Yazov is a Civil War buff.
   After a two-hour tour of the battlefield and viewing its famous
landmarks like Devil's Den and the Wheat Field, Yazov said, ``I
wish we would not have any battlefields like this one in the
future,'' The Gettysburg Times reported.
   Yazov's busy schedule called for speeches Tuesday at the
National Defense University at Fort Myer, Va., near the Pentagon
and before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, a private
group.
   Yazov will visit Camp Pendleton, a Marine training base in
Southern California, on Wednesday, and Luke Air Force Base in
Arizona on Thursday. On Friday he will tour Fort Bragg, N.C., then
return to Washington for a news conference with Cheney.

   About 200 students protesting a teacher's
alleged racial remark rioted in a Brooklyn high school Tuesday,
closing the school and injuring one police officer, officials said.
   About 1,000 students gathered in front of Eastern District High
School in the Williamsburg section after officials closed it
because of the incident.
   About 100 police officers tried to disperse the crowd, and were
met with scattered incidents of bottle throwing. A policewoman was
slightly injured when she was struck on the head, said police
spokesman Officer Joseph Gallagher.
   Four students were arrested on disorderly conduct charges and
one of them also was charged with disorderly conduct, Gallagher
said.
   Last week, ``during an African History class, the history
teacher made a remark that offended the students,'' Gallagher said.
The exact nature of the remark was not known.
   The teacher is white. About 75 percent of the school's 3,100
students are Hispanic and 22 percent are black, said Board of
Education spokesman Frank Sobrino, who declined to comment on the
remark.
   About 50 students met with the school's principal, Sonia Rivera,
on Tuesday, and went to the school's auditorium after the meeting
to voice their dissatisfaction.
   Ms. Rivera did not return repeated calls for comment.
   Shortly before noon, the group swelled to approximately 200
students, who rampaged through the hallways of the school's third
and fourth floors, breaking glass, before leaving the building,
Gallagher said.

<HEAD>Violinist Enters Guilty Plea, Placed On Probation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Violinist Eugene Fodor said he hopes to
rebuild his life and career now that he's been placed on probation
for pleading guilty to a drug-related break-in.
   ``I regard this event as a major turning point in my life,''
Fodor said Monday after a Dukes County court hearing.
   ``Of course I'm relieved that this ordeal is over,'' he said.
``The experience has been a frightening and profound one. What I
want to do now is get back to my music and my life.''
   Fodor, 39, of New York City, pleaded guilty to breaking into a
Martha's Vineyard motel room, where he was found July 27.
   A search of the room found a bottle containing more than 20
grams of cocaine, a hypodermic needle with a small amount of heroin
and a dagger, authorities said.
   A county grand jury met Monday morning and returned indictments
of breaking and entering, possession of heroin and cocaine and
possession of drug paraphernalia.
   After lawyers on both sides conferred, Fodor pleaded guilty to
the break-in charge, which carried a maximum penalty of six months
in jail.
   Judge Raymond Cross, however, placed Fodor on three years'
probation, in which he must continue a drug treatment program and
will be subject to random testing.
   Fodor pleaded innocent to the other charges, and they were
placed on file, pending completion of probation.
   ``This shouldn't have been treated as a serious criminal matter
and it wasn't,'' defense attorney Michael Altman said. ``Eugene
Fodor has been to a treatment center and has turned his life
around.''
   Born in Denver, Fodor began playing violin at age 8. He has
performed at the White House and in Moscow, where in 1974 he became
the first American medalist at the Tchaikovsky Violin Competition.
   After Fodor's arrest, family members and colleagues said his
drug use had begun recently, and followed the trouble he had
building on his early celebrity.
   ``This was a very important experience actually in his life,''
Altman said. ``He was feeling down in the dumps and he turned
toward drugs.''
   Altman said Fodor has undergone seven weeks of treatment, and
couselors say his progress has been good and they are confident he
can remain drug free.

   Barring unforeseen problems, NASA
was ready today to set the launch date for space shuttle Atlantis
and its nuclear-powered planetary payload.
   Shuttle managers were assessing the readiness of the orbiter,
the payload, the worldwide tracking network and other elements
during a two-day meeting that began Monday. No difficulties
surfaced during the first day, officials reported.
   Oct. 12 is the opening day of a launch opportunity when Earth
and Jupiter are aligned properly for sending the Galileo spacecraft
to that distant planet. The launch opportunity closes Nov. 21.
   Atlantis' crew of five astronauts is to dispatch Galileo on a
six-year journey to Jupiter. When the spacecraft reaches there in
1995, it will fire a scientific probe into the Jovian atmosphere
and then orbit the planet for two years of scrutiny.
   Because Galileo will be powered by two generators fueled by
plutonium-238, three citizens' groups last week sued in U.S.
District Court in Washington, D.C., to prevent the launch.
   The groups contend that a launch accident could spread poisonous
plutonium over a heavily-populated area of Florida.
   NASA has said the ``highest probability of launch area release
of plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than 1 in 2,500 and
such a release would have no appreciable adverse health effects on
the population.''
   The agency notes similar generators have flown on 22 U.S. space
vehicles, including five manned Apollo moon missions, and that in
three instances the well-protected devices survived severe
in-flight accidents.
   Judge Oliver Gasch has asked the citizens' groups and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to file briefs in the
case on Wednesday and Friday, respectively. He set a hearing for
Oct. 10, the day the countdown would begin for an Oct. 12 launch.
   Bruce Gagnon, coordinator of the Florida Coalition for Peace and
Justice, one of the three opposing groups, said last week that if
the lawsuit is not successful, his organization plans ``to put
people into the launch area to sit on top of the launch pad in an
effort to stop the launch.''

<HEAD>Jackson Runs in Atlanta; Other Races in Mississippi, Cleveland, Phoenix</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson was a strong favorite to
reclaim his old job today, while Mississippi Republicans tried to
retain a congressional seat that was left vacant when Rep. Larkin
Smith died in a plane crash.
   In Cleveland, five candidates battled in a primary election to
succeed Mayor George Voinovich, who is quitting after a decade in
office. Incumbent mayors were running in Phoenix and Albuquerque,
N.M.
   Jackson, Atlanta's first black mayor, said he was poised for a
``huge victory'' in his bid to reclaim the seat he held from
1974-82. Few observers expected him to be disappointed.
   Jackson would succeed Andrew Young, who followed him in office
and who now is exploring a bid for governor. Young, like Jackson
before him, is prohibited from seeking a third consecutive term.
   The most prominent among Jackson's five opponents was former
City Councilman Hosea Williams, who entered the race late after
Fulton County Commission Chairman Michael Lomax dropped out.
   Further south, two Democrats and a Republican were running in
the Mississippi special election to fill the seat left vacant by
Smith's death in August. The freshman Republican had served less
than eight months.
   State Attorney General Mike Moore, one of two Democrats running,
is the best known of the three candidates and was considered by
many to be the front-runner. The others are Republican Tom
Anderson, who has been an aide to Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., and
state Sen. Gene Taylor.
   If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff will be held Oct. 17.
   The winner will represent an 11{-county district in southeastern
Mississippi that has been in Republican hands since 1972 and is the
only GOP seat in the state's five-member House delegation.
   So far, Democrats have won four of six special elections to fill
U.S. House seats this year.
   In Cleveland, Voinovich's departure to run for governor led to a
free-for-all among five officeholders.
   Voinovich has endorsed the lone Republican in the race, Ralph J.
Perk Jr., the school board president and son of a former mayor.
   The other candidates, all Democrats, are Court Clerk Benny
Bonanno, City Council President George Forbes, Cuyahoga County
Commissioner Tim Hagan and state Sen. Michael White.
   The two top vote-getters will advance to the Nov. 7 general
election.
   In Phoenix, three-term incumbent Terry Goddard was the favorite
in a three-way non-partisan race, but the mayoral election was
somewhat overshadowed by a ballot issue on construction of a
downtown baseball stadium.
   Although Goddard favored the stadium, polls showed him far in
front of two challengers, state Republican Party chairman Burton
Kruglick and real estate broker Norris Inman, while the stadium
measure was trailing.
   In Albuquerque, Democrat Ken Schultz faced eight challengers in
his attempt to become the first mayor to be elected to back-to-back
terms since the city changed to a mayor-council form of government
15 years ago.

<HEAD>Study: Fat Bubbles Help Fight Lethal Infection in Cancer Patients</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cancer patients who cannot be treated for lethal
infections with a standard drug may become treatable if the drug is
enclosed in microscopic bubbles of fat, a study suggests.
   The bubbles carry the drug to the sites of infection with less
problem from the side effects that now limit its use, said
researcher Gabriel Lopez-Berestein.
   He reported a study of treating patients with the help of the
fat bubbles, called liposomes, at an American Medical Association
science reporters conference Monday.
   While there are several types of liposomes, the most widely
tested consists of multiple layers of fat arranged like the
structure of an onion.
   Liposomes can be used for targeting anti-fungal drugs because
they are consumed by white blood cells called macrophages, which
infiltrate sites of infection, said Lopez-Berestein, of the M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
   His study involved a powerful anti-fungal drug called
amphotericin-B. Its use is limited by its side effects, which
include severe chills and fever.
   Those side effects were less frequent and less severe when the
drug was enclosed in liposomes and given to 46 people with
infections. Most had become infected as a complication of leukemia,
but some were heart transplant patients.
   Transplant patients are vulnerable to fungal infections because
of therapy to suppress their disease-fighting immune systems, which
is aimed at keeping them from rejecting their hearts,
Lopez-Berestein said.
   Forty of the study's patients had previously failed to respond
to amphotericin-B and other anti-fungal drugs given conventionally,
because of allergy or side effects, he said.
   In the study, 24 patients showed a complete reponse to the
liposome-encapsulated drug, remaining free of the infection for six
months or more, he said. The 22 other patients failed to respond.
   The work will be published in a medical journal, he said.
   William Higuchi of the University of Utah, an authority on
methods for delivering drugs, called the results interesting. ``It
seems to me there are real possibilities there,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   Treating fungal infections is particularly important in leukemia
patients because anti-cancer therapy must be stopped during such
infections, Lopez-Berestein said. The cancer treatment inhibits the
immune system, encouraging more infections, he said.
   Liposomes also have been shown to improve effectiveness and
reduce side effects of a standard cancer drug in animals,
Lopez-Berestein said.
   They also may prove useful for attacking the virus that causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome after it has infected
macrophages, he said.

<HEAD>Romania's Ceausescu Proposes Warsaw Pact Intervention in Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania
proposed that forces of the Warsaw Pact military alliance intervene
to stop Poland from forming a government headed by non-communists,
a Hungarian official says.
   The pro-Solidarity Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza said Friday
that Hungary's Communist Party had received such a proposal from
Romania's Communist leaders, who staunchly oppose the wave of
reform sweeping the East bloc.
   Geza Kotai, secretary in charge of international affairs of the
Hungarian party, said his party had rejected the proposal. His
remark came in an interview with the party newspaper Nepszabadsag.
   Gazeta Wyborcza said Ceausescu called in the Polish ambassador
in August to complain about the planned formation of a
Solidarity-led government in Poland.
   It said Ceausescu decided to turn to the leaders of the Warsaw
Pact to ``jointly act in favor of preventing a serious situation in
Poland, in favor of defending socialism and the Polish nation.''
   The article did not say if Ceausescu had appealed to other
members of the seven-nation alliance led by the Soviet Union.
   Kotai said, however, the Hungarian Communist Party received a
call for intervention ``and we gave a definite rejection.''
   Solidarity journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki became leader of the
Polish government last month, the first non-Communist prime
minister in the Soviet bloc.
   The Hungarian Communist Party is among the most liberal in the
East bloc. It has agreed to hold free elections by June and says it
will yield power and join the opposition if it loses.

   Thank God for Tuesday garbage pickups.
   They saved Carol Tiedemann $5.2 million.
   Mrs. Tiedemann had never purchased a lottery ticket before last
week, and last weekend she discarded her first ticket stub,
thinking she'd lost.
   But watching a television report Monday, Mrs. Tidemann
recognized the winning numbers and fished her ticket from the
bottom of the garbage can. Fortunately, pickup was scheduled for
today, she said.
   ``Never in a million years did we expect to win,'' said Mrs.
Tiedemann, 22.
   Mrs. Tiedemann, who works in a shoe factory, and her husband,
Dan, told reporters they had no immediate plans on spending the
money.
   ``I haven't the slightest idea. We'll put it into the bank and
sit on it,'' said Tiedemann, 26, a machinist.
   The couple married in April and recently bought a house.
   Mrs. Tiedemann said she bought the Lotto America ticket at a
convenience store last week, playing the numbers 8 and 18 because
they were the month and date of her birthday. The four other
numbers _ 26, 30, 42, and 46 _ were selected at random, she said.
   Bill Clausius, a lottery spokesman, said the couple will receive
20 annual installments of $192,175 after taxes.

   The thing that went bump in the night at
Roy Carroll's house turned out to be a 7-foot boa constrictor.
   ``I don't want to wake up like that again,'' Carroll said. ``I'm
still scared. It was something to see.''
   The snake apparently was resting on a piece of plywood in the
rafters of Carroll's basement. As it crawled away, the plywood fell
and hit the basement floor.
   Carroll went down to investigate about 6:30 a.m. Monday and
found himself face to face with the snake.
   ``My first thought was to kill it, but I said, `no, I couldn't
do that,' 'cause if I had swung (a shovel) and missed, no telling
where it might have gone.''
   Carroll's wife, Peggy, called police, but when Officer Sherry
Lingerfelt arrived, she didn't feel real comfortable about handling
the creature.
   So Ms. Lingerfelt called her sergeant, Larry Stroud. The snake
didn't scare Stroud.
   Stroud got hold of the snake's head and he and Ms. Lingerfelt
put it into two large plastic garbage bags and brought it to the
police station.
   Police said they would auction the the snake if its owner
doesn't show up.

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Consider Rolling Back Miranda Warning Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Lloyd Perkins boasted about his
experience as a killer to two fellow jail inmates who said they
wanted to help him escape, he didn't suspect he was incriminating
himself in a 2-year-old unsolved murder.
   Perkins' statements are the focus of a potentially important
Supreme Court case that could roll back the rights of criminal
suspects to be given so-called Miranda warnings.
   The high court, beginning what promises to be another
controversy-laden term Monday, agreed to use the Perkins case from
Illinois to decide whether undercover agents may elicit confessions
from jailed criminal suspects.
   The justices said they will hear arguments by Illinois officials
seeking to use Perkins' statements to prosecute him for murder.
   In its normally busy opening session, the court issued orders in
more than 1,000 cases _ denying review to most and agreeing to
study 22 that will be among more than 150 disputes to be decided by
the end of the term in July.
   The court heard arguments in a Yonkers, N.Y., desegregation case
in which four city councilmen were held in contempt for opposing a
plan for attracting subsidized housing to the city's white
neighborhoods.
   The justices also are looking ahead to a term in which they have
agreed to decide thorny right-of-privacy arguments in three
abortion disputes and the high court's first ``right to die''
controversy.
   In other action on the first day of its term, the court:
   _Agreed to decide whether police nationwide may use sobriety
checkpoints in trying to curb drunken drivers. The court will
review rulings by Michigan courts striking down that state's
sobriety checkpoint program as an unconstitutional invasion of
privacy. Courts in other states have upheld virtually identical
police tactics.
   _Agreed to use a multimillion dollar dispute over the Alfred
Hitchcock classic, ``Rear Window,'' to resolve key copyright issues.
   _Said they will decide in an Illinois case whether public
employers may be forced to put aside partisanship when hiring,
promoting and transferring employees.
   _Left intact Maryland's revocation of a $300,000-a-year tax
break for a men-only golf club that has counted presidents and
members of Congress among its members.
   _Refused to spare an evangelical Christian group in Lenox,
Mass., from having to return $5.5 million donated by a wealthy
ex-member.
   _Allowed states to criminally prosecute employers accused of
neglecting the health and safety of their employees. The justices,
without comment, let stand a ruling in an Illinois case that
federal workplace regulations do not bar such state prosecutions.
   In the Perkins case, the court could weaken its famous 1966
Miranda ruling that requires police to warn suspects of their right
to an attorney and to remain silent.
   An Illinois appeals court ruled in November that police violated
Perkins' rights when they planted an undercover agent in jail to
question him about a murder.
   Perkins was charged with fatally shooting Richard Stephenson on
Nov. 8, 1984, in Fairview Heights.
   Police lacked a suspect in the murder in 1986 when Donald
Charlton, an inmate at Graham Correctional Facility in Hillsboro,
told authorities he had information about the homicide.
   Police then placed Charlton and undercover narcotics officer
John Parisi in the Montgomery County Jail on March 31, 1986.
Perkins was being held there awaiting trial on a charge of
aggravated battery unrelated to the homicide.
   Parisi, using the alias Vito Bianco, wore motorcycle garb and
told Perkins he was interested in planning an escape.
   Then Parisi asked Perkins whether he had ever ``done someone,''
a phrase the appeals court said was intended to elicit information
about any killings in which Perkins took part.
   The appeals court said Perkins recounted in detail the killing
of Stephenson.
   A state judge ruled in 1987 that Perkins' jailhouse statements
to Charlton and Parisi about the Stephenson killing could not be
admitted as evidence.
   But state officials said the Miranda ruling only should protect
suspects against police coercion, and that there was no coercion in
Perkins' case.
   But the Illinois appeals court said the Miranda ruling applies
whenever a suspect is in custody, ``even when the purpose of the
custody is unrelated to the purpose of the interrogation.''
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that law enforcement officials
cannot hire jailhouse informants to induce criminal defendants in
custody to make incriminating statements.
   The justices in that ruling relied on their own 1964 decision _
handed down two years before Miranda _ that barred government
agents from eliciting incriminating information from defendants
entitled to a lawyer's help during interrogation.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached to Stiffen Auto Emission Requirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clean air legislation is gaining momentum in
the House, following a breakthrough agreement that would apply
California's tough auto tailpipe standards to the whole country
starting with 1994 models.
   The 22-0 vote Monday in the House Energy and Commerce
environment subcommittee came after two powerful lawmakers _ Reps.
Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., and John D. Dingell, D-Mich. _ shook
hands and ended a bitter dispute over the auto standards.
   Waxman, the champion of environmental groups, and Dingell, the
auto industry's best friend in Congress, said Monday they would
oppose any attempts to change the agreement. Their pact virtually
ensures new, tough auto pollution controls because the Senate's
clean air legislation is even stricter than the compromise.
   The auto industry was quick to express its displeasure with the
proposed exhaust standards. Harold A. Poling, chief operating
officer for Ford Motor Co., said the standards ``are not feasible
and ... would improve air quality by less than 1 percent compared
with the president's proposal.''
   Richard Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition,
called the vote ``a genuine step forward'' and ``a signal to the
industrial community and others that achieving clean air will take
a commitment from all interests to do their part.'' The coalition
includes environmental groups and their allies.
   The California requirements, tougher than the rest of the
country's, would be phased in beginning with 1994 models and be
complete in the other 49 states by 1996 _ at an average cost to
consumers of nearly $100 per car, according to Environmental
Protection Agency estimates.
   The emissions disputes have helped keep clean air bills in a
legislative bottleneck in past years, and threatened to torpedo
President Bush's clean air bill, which the subcommittee vote
amended.
   The compromise followed extensive private negotiations over the
past week that involved Dingell, Waxman and a number of House
colleagues who said they were tired of a clean air stalemate that
has lasted a decade. The last major clean air law changes were
passed in 1977.
   The Bush administration accepted the compromise reluctantly and
expressed hope for quick progress on other portions of the bill in
Waxman's subcommittee.
   ``This opens the gates to the passage of clean air legislation _
if not this year then next year,'' said Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa,
who added that the tailpipe compromise would help lawmakers reach
agreement on other parts of the legislation. Added Rep. Bill
Richardson, D-N.M., ``We still have an enormous amount of work to
do.''
   White House deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said the
Dingell-Waxman provisions, though tighter than what the president
proposed, are ``really not too far away from ours.'' He said the
White House would ``have to see what comes out'' of the committee
before commenting further.
   General Motors said, ``Today's action goes to an extreme which
will bring virtually no significant benefits over what the
bipartisan bill provides, but will mean huge costs to the consumer
and high risks for the industry.''
   Following the agreement, lawmakers differing over the makeup of
Bush's proposed clean fuels program for autos intensified efforts
to reach a compromise.
   Also remaining are differences over sharing the cost of acid
rain reduction; a ``cap'' on acid rain growth that could slow power
plant expansion; and the extent of controls on virtually
unregulated airborne toxic chemicals.
   The Dingell-Waxman agreement is mainly designed to reduce ozone
pollution. Motor vehicles account for nearly half of the nation's
pollution from ozone, a highly reactive gas that is the prime
ingredient of smog and which can cause breathing difficulties.
   Ozone is produced by the reaction of hydrocarbons from unburned
fuel with nitrogen oxides, another vehicle pollutant, in the
presence of sunlight. Warm weather speeds the reaction.
   The key provisions of the compromise:
   _Beginning with 1994 models, cars and light duty trucks could
emit 0.25 grams per mile of non-methane hydrocarbons for five years
or 50,000 miles, whichever comes first; and 0.31 grams per mile
after that up to 10 years or 100,000 miles. The current federal
limit on these emissions is 0.41 grams.
   _For carbon monoxide, the limit would be 3.4 grams per mile in
the five-year, 50,000-mile period, the same as current law; and 4.2
grams after that up to 10 years or 100,000 mile period.
   _Beginning with 1994 cars and 1995 light-duty trucks, emissions
of nitrogen oxides would be held to 0.4 grams per mile, the current
California limit. The standard would be phased in over two years,
40 percent the first year and 100 percent the second. The current
federal limit is 1 gram per mile.
   The EPA would have to decide by Dec. 31, 1999, whether to
tighten the requirements further. If the administrator did nothing,
tough standards originally proposed by Waxman would take effect
automatically Jan. 1, 2003.

<HEAD>Economists Believe Fed Will Resist Pressure to Cut Interest Rates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates are likely to show little
change for the rest of this year despite Bush administration
pressure on the Federal Reserve for lower rates aimed at boosting
economic growth, many economists believe.
   These analysts look for interest rates, including mortgage
rates, to move up and down in a narrow range in coming months as
the Fed tries to steer the $5 trillion U.S. economy along a path of
moderating growth and moderating inflation.
   Policymakers at the Fed gathered for a closed-door strategy
session today of the Federal Open Market Committee, composed of
members of the Fed board in Washington and five of the 12 Fed
regional bank presidents.
   While the results of their deliberations will not be publicly
disclosed for six weeks, many economists were predicting that the
central bank will decide to make no changes to its current credit
stance.
   These analysts believe that the Fed is on the verge of achieving
its hoped-for soft landing, whereby growth slows just enough in the
second half of the year to keep inflation in check but not enough
to topple the country into a recession.
   ``The country is on a moderate but sustainable growth course. It
is exactly the kind of low-altitude flying that the Fed has been
seeking,'' said David Jones, chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp;
Co., a government securities dealer.
   Because of the belief that the Fed will not fiddle with its
monetary controls, analysts were looking for little change in
interest rates in coming months.
   Banks' prime lending rate, which serves as a benchmark for many
business and consumer loans, was expected to hold at 10.5 percent.
   Long-term rates, reflected by Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bonds, were expected to trade in a narrow range between 8 percent
and 8.5 percent.
   Mortgage rates, which have been on a roller coaster this year,
were expected to stabilize as well, right around the current level
of 10.16 percent.
   Fixed-term mortgages hit a high this year of 11.22 percent in
April and fell as low as 9.68 percent in early August before rising
slightly in recent weeks.
   The administration, however, is convinced that further rate
declines are needed to improve the economic outlook next year.
   Both Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and
Budget, and Michael Boskin, the president's chief economic adviser,
have made comments recently about the need for the Fed to lower
interest rates.
   In remarks that were endorsed by President Bush, Darman
complained that the central bank was keeping interest rates too
high and would have to bear the blame if the country topples into a
recession next year.
   The administration apparently is also unhappy because it
believes the central bank should be doing more to support last
week's agreement by the United States and six other economic powers
to drive the dollar lower as a way of improving America's huge
trade deficit.
   Lower interest rates in the United States would push the dollar
down because dollar-denominated assets would be less attractive to
foreign investors. A lower dollar makes U.S. exports more
competitive on overseas markets.
   ``There is a good deal of domestic political and international
heat on the Fed to ease policy further in order to push the dollar
lower to keep exports strong and the economy strong over the
remainder of this year and next year,'' Jones said.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co., agreed, saying,
``This administration wants very much to avoid any slowdown in an
election year'' next year when 435 House districts and one-third of
the Senate seats are at stake.
   After a yearlong credit-tightening effort, the central bank
eased credit slightly in June and July in the face of mounting
signs that the record seven-year economic expansion was in danger
of faltering.
   Since that time, however, much of the data on which the Fed
based its decision has been revised to show the economy was not
that weak in the spring and summer.
   Many economists believe the Fed would actually be tightening
credit now if it had not been for various reports showing that
inflation, which spurted ahead early in the year because of higher
energy and food costs, was moderating as well.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said she was
not looking for the Fed to ease further unless economic growth in
the final three months of the year falters much more than is
currently expected.

<HEAD>Americans Adopting More Foreign Babies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are adopting nearly 50 percent more
foreign babies than they did a decade ago, a private adoption group
says.
   William L. Pierce, president of the National Committee for
Adoption, said Monday the increase was not surprising, with as many
as a million American couples unable to have children of their own
and only about 50,000 children available for unrelated domestic
adoptions.
   But these adoption also show the underlying altruism of
Americans, Pierce said, noting that many foreign children were
adopted even when more American babies were available.
   The rise in foreign adoptions accounted for a large percentage
of the overall adoption increase in recent years, he said.
   Americans adopted 10,019 foreign babies in 1987, the most recent
year for which Immigration and Naturalization Service statistics
were available. That was a 46 percent increase over 1977 when there
were 6,854 foreign adoptions, Pierce said.
   However, Pierce complained that there are children within the
United States who aren't adopted because of ``a new racism'' by
adoption agencies.
   These agencies often try to find parents who match the child,
both of the same race, or the same mix as the baby's natural
parents. That can result in willing parents being denied a child
because they are of a different race, he said.
   Pierce's comments came as his committee released its ``Adoption
Factbook,'' the second such book it has produced, compiling
national facts and figures on adoptions, adoption laws and
regulations and listing sources of information and help.
   Other than the INS, the federal government no longer collects
adoption statistics, said Pierce, so his group is seeking to fill
that gap. The committee describes itself as a private organization
that encourages adoption but takes no stand on abortion.
   The first book covered adoptions through 1982, and the new
edition brings the figures up to 1986, except for the foreign
babies, which include 1987.
   Pierce said that 7,614 of the 1987 foreign adoptions were from
Asia, while only 122 were from Europe. Females were slightly in the
majority at 56 percent.
   The most common country of origin was South Korea, he said, and
the state where the largest share found new homes was New York.

   Mick Jagger joined some fans in a short
jam session in the parking lot of Sullivan Stadium before a
sold-out Rolling Stones show.
   Eighteen fans from Biddeford, Maine, were sitting around their
rented camper playing Stones songs Sunday when a guy in a hooded
sweatshirt and sunglasses came by. When the hood and glasses were
lifted, Jagger emerged.
   ``Is there a word that carries more of an impact than `shocked?'
'' asked Chris Robinson, 27.
   ``It was mind-blowing,'' he said. ``Mick made several lifetime
dreams happen.''
   Linn Tanzman, a publicist for the Stones tour, confirmed that
Jagger participated in the session.
   Robinson and friend Jim O'Neil said Jagger wandered up to the
group as they were singing ``You Can't Always Get What You Want.''
   ``We started to stop (singing), but he motioned to us to keep
going,'' O'Neil said. ``I thought, `If he wants to hear it, fine.'
''
   Robinson handed the 46-year-old rock star a percussion
instrument, and suggested he sing a verse or two.
   ``Where are we?'' Jagger asked.
   ``The drugstore,'' said Robinson, referring to a verse in the
song.
   Jagger picked up the song, and for the next five minutes
Robinson, O'Neil and their friends got to accompany their hero.
   ``Mick's voice was great,'' Robinson said. ``He did `You Can't
Always Get What You Want' during the concert, but he sounded better
on our version.''

   Chris Evert, who said good-bye to Grand Slam
tennis after last month's U.S. Open, became the first woman and
first tennis player to be nominated for the Farewell to Sport Award.
   Pittsburgh's Dapper Dan Club also announced Monday that
basketball's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, baseball's Mike Schmidt and
football's Tom Landry were finalists for the award, which honors
retirees for a career of ``competitive excellene and community
service.'' The awards will be presented Feb. 10.
   Evert, 34, won 18 events on the Grand Slam tour _ six U.S.
Opens, seven French Opens, three Wimbledons and two Australian
Opens _ and a record 157 singles titles. She still plans to play
minor tournaments and exhibitions in coming months.
   Abdul-Jabbar, 42, played a record 20 seasons for the Milwaukee
Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers and set records for points, Most
Valuable Player Awards, games and minutes played and blocked shots.
   Landry, 65, coached the Dallas Cowboys their first 29 years,
leading them to two Super Bowl victories in five appearances and a
record 20-straight winning seasons. He was fired last February.
   Schmidt, 40, retired in May. The Philadelphia Phillies' third
baseman hit 548 home runs, seventh best in baseball history, and
won three MVP awards.

   Robert Culp says he made Bill Cosby an actor,
putting his own career in jeopardy to save their mid-1960s ``I
Spy'' show and Cosby's future with it.
   ``Bill was not much of an actor when I first met him, and he
struck me as the angriest man alive,'' Culp said in this week's TV
Guide magazine. ``He had this tremendous chip on his shoulder, as
if the world owed him a living.''
   Culp said Cosby's performance in the first episode of the
television show didn't impress Grant Tinker, then NBC's West Coast
programming chief, and he canceled the show.
   Culp said he defended Cosby and pressured NBC to give the series
another chance.
   ``I was convinced Bill was going to be right for the part,''
Culp said. ``People only had to be patient. I knew it was risky to
go out on such a limb, but I was sure I could make Bill an actor
overnight by rewriting the scripts for him. So I told Leonard: `If
NBC gets rid of Bill, they'll have to get rid of me, too.'''
   Cosby won't talk about the matter and Tinker has trouble
recalling the events, TV Guide said. But the show's executive
producer, Sheldon Leonard, disagreed with Culp's comments on the
early cancellation order, saying NBC had a year's commitment.
   ``The show couldn't be canceled,'' Leonard said. But he added,
``There were some doubts about Cosby's acting _ he had only been a
stand-up comic.''

   Former first lady Nancy Reagan said she was
not prepared for the intense scrutiny that comes with being the
president's wife, but she's looking forward to releasing her
version of her White House years.
   ``You never stop being hurt by the stories, but you do stop
being surprised,'' Mrs. Reagan said.
   ``I figure after eight years of everybody having their say it
was my turn. Eight years is a long time to live under a microscope
and have things misinterpreted,'' she said.
   Her book, ``My Turn,'' will be released soon.
   Filling in for her husband, Mrs. Reagan spoke Monday at the the
annual California Grocers Association meeting. The former president
is ``doing very well,'' she said, recovering from skull surgery to
remove water on his brain that developed after he was thrown from a
horse.

   Glenda Jackson, rehearsing the role of Martha
in a revival of ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' says she was
inspired by seeing a theater legend play the role in the early
1960s.
   Miss Jackson, 53, winner of Oscars for ``Women in Love'' in 1970
and ``A Touch of Class'' in 1973, was a young actress looking for a
break when she saw Edward Albee's play open in London with Uta
Hagen as Martha and Arthur Hill as George.
   ``I literally don't remember breathing throughout the entire
evening,'' she said. ``There was an extraordinary power to the play
and the performances were nothing short of astonishing.
   ``When you see performances like that, it truly is
inspirational.''
   The play opens a 10-week engagement Thursday at the Doolittle
Theatre, with John Lithgow as George.

<HEAD>Time to Move to Marketplace With Farm Products: Senators</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's time to move from the lab to the
marketplace with products such as ink made from soybeans and
biodegradable plastics made from corn starch, say two senators
whose legislation would speed the process.
   ``We can make literally thousands of environmentally safe,
innovative new products from the renewable resources grown on
American farms,'' said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., who has teamed
with Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, on the Alternative Agricultural
Research and Commercialization Act.
   The measure combines legislation they had introduced separately.
   In moving his bill through the last Congress, Harkin said he
found the Agriculture Department ``minimally oriented'' toward
finding new commercial products for crops.
   ``Current research being conducted at USDA is too often directed
at improving yields of existing crops,'' he said Monday, noting
problems with overproduction. ``This bill will change that research
emphasis and aid in the development of markets for the new products
being created.''
   ``We can make ink for soybeans instead of petroleum,'' Conrad
said. ``We can make red dye that won't cause cancer out of
sunflower hulls. We can make degradable plastics out of corn starch
instead of crude oil. We can make insulation from milkweed instead
of fiberglass.''
   Coincidentally, the Association of Industrial Crops is holding a
convention this week to exchange ideas on new uses for farm
products in Peoria, Ill., the home of the Agriculture Department's
research center doing work in this area.
   The problem with USDA's program is unreliable funding. Sometimes
there's money and sometimes there isn't.
   The Conrad-Harkin bill would provide $10 million in 1990, $20
million in 1991, $30 million in 1992, $50 million in 1993 and $75
million for the next six years.
   Once research and development are completed, the bill provides
for technical and financial assistance to businesses to help
commercialize the products through regional centers around the
country.
   Conrad's original bill was sponsored by Rep. Timothy Penny,
D-Minn., in the House. It passed in the House, but didn't get to
the Senate floor last year. Harkin's bill passed the Senate three
times, but didn't get through the House.
   The new legislation is widely supported and awaiting hearings in
the Senate Agriculture Committee. Congressional aides say the plan
is to pass it as separate legislation, but keep open the option of
attaching it to the 1990 farm bill.

   The Senate Agriculture Committee resumes
hearings Wednesday on James Cason, President Bush's controversial
nominee for assistant secretary of agriculture for natural
resources and the environment.
   Cason was questioned for four hours Sept. 27 about decisions he
made while a high-ranking official at the Interior Department.
Those decisions have drawn strong criticism from environmentalists.
   Key among the issues was a report on the effects of logging in
national forests on the survival of the spotted owl. Cason denied
accusations that he sought to hide a report that said the owl would
be greatly endangered by the harvesting of old-growth trees in the
Pacific Northwest.
   If confirmed, Cason's duties would include overseeing the U.S.
Forest Service.
   Groups that endorse Cason include the National Cattleman's
Association, the Forest Timber Products Association, the American
Farm Bureau and the Multiple-Use Land Alliance, a pro-development
group that supports private uses of public lands.
   He is opposed by the Wilderness Society, the National Wildlife
Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council and the National
Audubon Society.

<HEAD>US Experts Oppose Readmitting Soviets to Psychiatric Association</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet efforts to curb psychiatric abuse,
including an independent monitoring commission, are not enough to
warrant readmitting Moscow to the World Psychiatric Association,
U.S. experts say.
   The Soviets recently acknowledged that political and religious
dissidents were incarcerated in psychiatric institutions _ a
Western charge they long denied _ and in an unusual move sent a
diplomat to Congress on Monday to testify about their reforms.
   The Soviet ``All-Union Scientific Society of Psychiatrists ...
is doing its utmost to implement and translate into reality the
needed reforms in the field of medical care and psychiatric
health,'' said Georgi Markosov, a counselor at the Soviet Embassy.
   ``To prevent the use of psychiatry for non-medical purposes as
well as to assure maximum openness in specific cases of misuse of
psychiatry, an independent commission has been established, which
is composed of eight persons,'' Markosov told the House Committee
on Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment.
   ``The commission is independent from the Health Ministry or any
(Communist) Party or state organs,'' he said, reading a statement
from the Soviet psychiatric society.
   Before this year, it was rare for Soviet officials to testify
before Congress, but since January, about a half-dozen have done so.
   Despite the Soviets' effort to present their best case for
readmission to the World Psychiatric Association, subcommittee
chairman Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and other U.S. experts said
the Kremlin has not gone far enough.
   The U.S. Delegation to Assess Soviet Psychiatry, which visited
the Soviet Union this year, reported to Congress that ``while some
victims have been released, forced incarceration under the guise of
treatment for insanity remains an institutional problem,'' Waxman
said.
   ``Perhaps even worse, the perpetrators of these abuses remain in
key leadership positions in Soviet psychiatry,'' Waxman said.
   Besides formation of the independent commission, Markosov
detailed reforms including:
   _New regulations that led to dropping 736,000 people from
so-called psychiatric registration lists. U.S. experts said the
lists contained 10.2 million names and were used for job screening.
   _New rules that bar forcible commitment to a psychiatric
institution without the consent of patients or their relatives,
unless the patient poses a physical danger. ``Psychiatrists who
wrongly hospitalize mentally healthy persons may be sentenced to a
two-year prison term,'' he said.
   _Abolition in the Russian federation, the largest of the 15
Soviet republics, of two laws often used against dissidents.
   _A ban on the use of sulphazine, a drug made of pulverized
sulfur that has been injected into political dissidents, causing
extreme pain, fever and disorientation. Western experts say it has
no medical value.
   Most of the steps had been publicized previously, but the
existence of the commission was not known in the West, said another
witness, Peter Reddaway, a George Washington University professor
who was a member of the U.S. delegation that visited the Soviet
Union this year.
   ``It remains to be seen whether it is indeed vigorous and
independent,'' said Reddaway.
   The American Psychiatric Association, which supported the work
of the U.S. delegation, has voted to oppose readmission of the
Soviet group to the world body, which is scheduled to meet in
Athens, Greece, on Oct. 11-16. The world body condemned Soviet
practices in 1977 and the Soviets withdrew in 1983, facing almost
certain expulsion.
   ``It is my sincere hope as well as the hope of the American
Psychiatric Association that there will be a time in the near
future when we can wholeheartedly welcome the All-Union Society of
Psychiatrists and Narcologists of the USSR into the World
Psychiatric Association,'' testified Ellen Mercer, head of
international programs for the U.S. organization.
   ``It is also our concern that, unfortunately, this time has not
yet arrived,'' Mercer said.
   Soviet health officials who in the past sent dissidents to
psychiatric institutions remain in senior government posts, said
Reddaway, and they could resume their abuses if there is a
conservative reaction along the lines of the crackdown in China
this summer.
   The officials he mentioned were Yevgeny Chazov, the health
minister; Nikolai Zharikov, last year appointed the head of the
Soviet Society of Psychiatrists and Narcologists; Georgy Morozov,
who for decades has headed the Serbsky Institute where many
political dissidents have been held in psychiatric care, and
Alexander Churkin, chief psychiatrist of the ministry of health.

   What does a Soviet husband buy his
mother-in-law for her birthday? Radioactive apples from Chernobyl.
   Stroke patients at Sunnyview Hospital got a taste of that
not-quite-ready-for-prime-time Soviet humor Monday as a group of
humorists from the Soviet Union delivered one-liners and anecdotes.
   ``People are people everywhere _ except maybe politicians are
different,'' Andrey Benyukh, deputy foreign editor of the Moscow
humor magazine Krokodil, told the patients.
   Five Soviet satirists, cartoonists and editors of monthly humor
magazines published in the Ukraine, Estonia and Moscow are on a
two-week visit to the United States. The program was arranged
through a cultural exchange sponsored by the International
Association of Professional Bureaucrats, an organization of 1,700
humorists.
   The Soviets were at the Schenectady hospital to see its humor
program that's designed to help patients deal with their ailments.
   The group began its tour Thursday in Washington, D.C., and
arrived in Saratoga Springs on Saturday for a four-day visit to the
Albany area.
   With quips and anecdotes, these observers of America cracked up
patients and reporters during an impromptu news conference on the
contents of their recently published book, ``Soviet Humor: The Best
of Krokodil.''
   The collection of cartoons, with English translations, resulted
from a visit to the United States by a group of Soviets in 1987,
said James Boren, president of the organization.
   The compilation by 82 cartoonists offers sketches that are
political, satirical and, supposedly, funny to all cultures.
   Take, for instance, the one showing a husband and wife in their
living room with the silhouette of a man in the background. The cut
line: ``Relax dear, it's not the police. It's just burglars.''
   Then of course there was the Soviet variation of the American
``Mother-in-law-in-Trunk'' jokes.
   A lady is pictured selling two baskets of apples. Crimean apples
were trading slowly at a cheap 35 kopecks apiece. But overpriced
Chernobyl apples were selling like hotcakes at 5 rubles each.
   ``People are buying them for their mothers-in-law, their
bosses,'' the caption says.
   The openness under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has allowed
Soviet people to ``take up subjects which, until recently, we could
only discuss with our friends in our kitchens ... privately,'' said
Leonid Florentiev, foreign editor of Krokodil.
   He urged Gorbachev to continue to extend those freedoms.
   ``If you stop at this stage, it can easily be turned the other
way around. You have to go ahead to achieve some positive
results,'' Florentiev said.

   Vice President Dan Quayle says Soviet
officials are ``misreading the tea leaves'' if they think the Bush
administration is lessening its commitment to the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   ``They better go back and read what we said and what the SDI
program is all about now,'' Quayle said Monday.
   The vice president created a stir last month when he said the
Reagan administration had indulged in ``political jargon'' when it
originally portrayed the SDI program _ also known as Star Wars _ as
a leak-proof, impenetrable anti-missile shield.
   The Soviets, in their latest strategic arms initiative,
conditionally dropped their insistence that Americans abandon plans
to deploy a space-based anti-missile system. But they reserved the
right to abrogate a strategic arms agreement on short notice if the
United States ever actually deployed such a system.
   Quayle, in an interview with The Associated Press and other news
organizations, said the concept of SDI had been scaled back in the
last 12 months of the Reagan administration.
   ``What we're talking about is a realistic SDI system,'' said
Quayle. ``If (the Soviets) view a phased deployment and a
redefinition of SDI as lessening of the commitment, they're
misreading the tea leaves.
   ``It's showing you can do it from a political point of view,
from a technological point of view and that President Bush is
serious about an SDI system,'' said Quayle, a stalwart SDI
supporter.
   Quayle, who returned Friday from a four-nation tour of Asia,
said the Bush administration may ask Congress to loosen
restrictions on foreign aid to allow the Philippines to beef up
internal security against communist insurgents.
   Quayle was instrumental in securing a similar waiver for El
Salvador after a visit to that strife-torn nation earlier this year.
   Quayle said a waiver of the restriction would ``help protect
American lives as we have become increasing targets'' in the
Philippines. Two Americans working at a U.S. military base were
ambushed and killed by Filipino terrorists shortly before Quayle's
arrival last Tuesday.
   The Philippines will receive almost $650 million in U.S. aid
next year. Quayle did not say how much he felt should be shifted to
internal security, but aides said the country needs basic equipment
including two-way radios for police cars in Manila.
   Philippines President Corazon Aquino agreed during Quayle's
visit to open negotiations in December on the lease agreements for
Clark Air Base, Subic Bay naval station and four other U.S.
military facilities. Those agreements expire in September 1991.
   Quayle said the United States hopes for a long-term, indefinite
extension of the leases. Setting a date for closing the bases would
send the wrong signal to investors looking for signs of stability
in the Philippines, he said.
   ``There is a very vocal anti-American community in the
Philippines,'' Quayle said. ``I don't put everyone that's
anti-American in the terrorist camp. ... It's a combination of
anti-Americanism plus pro-Philippine and self-respect and
self-dignity.''
   But just ``traveling the streets of Manila'' and seeing its
poverty underscores the need for economic development, he said.
   ``I think we are a stabilizing force in the Philippines, and
stability is what investors and people look to,'' said Quayle, who
also visited Japan, South Korea and Malaysia on his fourth foreign
trip of the year.
   On other issues, Quayle:
   _Shrugged off a question about his low standing in public
opinion polls. ``I'm gratified for the president's good standing in
polls. That's my concern right now. I got plenty of time to worry
about my own,'' said the 44-year-old vice president.
   _Declared the United States' main goal in Cambodia is to bolster
the non-communist resistance and prevent the ``mass murderers'' of
the Khmer Rouge from regaining power.
   _Said the government of China must change its attitude about the
massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square last
June. ``The problem is China continues to perceive that nothing
happened, or whatever happened is nobody's business, and therefore
it's for us to change, not them,'' Quayle said.

<HEAD>Bush's Steel Import Plan Moves to Senate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The extension of steel import restraints, once
a contentious issue in Congress, is all but assured after an
overwhelming House vote to extend restrictions until 1992.
   Monday's 354-10 vote approved President Bush's compromise to
extend the restrictions on 29 foreign trading partners until April
1992. The ``no'' votes were all Republicans.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., has introduced a companion measure in
the Senate, where bipartisan approval is expected soon.
   Bush's plan, announced July 25, called for immediate
negotiations with Japan, South Korea and other leading
steel-exporting nations to extend annual limitations on the volume
of steel allowed into the United States.
   The original pacts, which expired Saturday, were negotiated by
the Reagan administration in 1984 to give domestic steelmakers
breathing space from subsidized, foreign competition.
   Many steel-district lawmakers pushed the administration to
extend the curbs for another five years, but Bush opted for a
smaller-scale, 2{-year program in deference to steel-using
manufacturers. The manufacturers argued that the quotas have driven
up prices and caused supply shortages of some steel products.
   The manufacturers had enlisted dozens of lawmakers prepared to
argue against a five-year continuation, but the compromise all but
eliminated the debate. House opposition came largely from
free-traders who felt the steel industry has had enough protection.
   ``It's not my first choice,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.,
who had opposed a longer extension. ``Nevertheless, I have to admit
it's about as good a compromise as could be achieved.''
   Rep. Joseph Gaydos, D-Pa., who represents a western Pennsylvania
steel district, said the program ``is not a cure-all, but has been
the most effective method of dealing with dumped imports.''
   ``This legislation is basically and fundamentally giving the
steel industry in this country a little more time to become
competitive. And they're well under way,'' Gaydos said.
   With the old program due to expire Sept. 30, the administration
could not afford to wait until Congress acted to begin the
painstaking process of negotiating new import ceilings.
   Trade representatives from Japan, South Korea, the European
Community, Mexico, Venezuela and Romania were in town last week for
meetings on renewing their pacts.
   Many of the negotiations are already complete, said U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills. Even though Congress hasn't finished
work on the bill, she said steel imports would continue to be
monitored by the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Customs
Service.
   No details on individual pacts have been announced.
   In a prepared statement Monday, the American Iron and Steel
Institute applauded U.S. negotiators for their work but stressed
that the Bush program should not preclude American steelmakers from
filing unfair trade complaints, if necessary, against foreign
governments.
   Voting against the bill were Republicans Steve Bartlett and
Richard Armey of Texas, Tom Campbell, Christopher Cox and Dana
Rohrbacher of California, Philip Crane of Illinois, Jim Kolbe and
Bob Stump of Arizona, and Tom Petri and James Sensenbrenner of
Wisconsin.

<HEAD>Texas School Financing Declared Unconstitutional</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ruling that the funding of Texas schools
is unconstitutional will mean a chance at equality for poorer
districts in the nation's second-largest school system, a lawyer in
the case says.
   The state's education commissioner, who had defended the
financing system, called for a tax increase so poorer districts can
``equalize upward.'' But Gov. Bill Clements said more money won't
necessarily solve the problem.
   Monday's unanimous 9-0 decision by the Texas Supreme Court found
``glaring disparities'' between rich and poor school districts,
violating a requirement in the state Constitution for an
``efficient system'' of public schools.
   The court said financing for Texas' 3.3 million students must be
overhauled by May.
   ``A remedy is long overdue,'' Justice Oscar Mauzy's opinion
said. ``The Legislature must take immediate action.''
   Clements said he will call a special 30-day session of the
Legislature in the spring to grapple with the problem after a task
force still to be named makes its recommendations.
   The court said it would not tell the Legislature how to correct
the inequities or order it to increase taxes, but warned: ``A
Band-Aid will not suffice; the system itself must be changed.''
   The state, whose school system follows California as the
nation's largest, will make nearly $10 billion available for public
schools in 1990-91, and almost $12 billion is expected from local
districts.
   But because of disparities in property wealth, annual spending
per student among districts ranges from $2,112 to $19,333, the
court said. Schools are funded with local property taxes and state
aid.
   In 1988, Comptroller Bob Bullock found 730 of the 1,100
districts spend less than the statewide average of $3,290 per
student per year. The average in those districts was $2,976.
   An Austin state district judge had declared the system
unconstitutional in a 1984 case brought by poor districts against
state Education Commissioner W.N. Kirby and others. That ruling was
overturned last December by a 2-1 vote of the Austin-based 3rd
Court of Appeals.
   But the high court found ``the state's school financing system
is neither financially efficient, nor efficient in the sense of
providing for a `general diffusion of knowledge' statewide.''
   The ruling prompted celebrations in Edgewood Independent School
District in San Antonio, the lead plaintiff.
   ``We took on the state of Texas and we beat 'em,'' said
Superintendent James Vasquez.
   About 1,800 students and teachers rallied at the Edgewood
stadium, holding banners reading ``Victory'' and ``Edgewood All the
Way'' as a band played. A marquee at the entrance read, ``Texas
Children 9, Kirby 0.''
   The ruling ``is going to mean a chance at equality,'' said
attorney Al Kauffman with the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund, who represented Edgewood and several other
districts.
   Demetrio Rodriguez, who launched a fight for equal school
funding in 1968 that reached the U.S. Supreme Court before it was
rejected, said he cried when he heard of the ruling: ``It really is
something that has been in my heart.''
   Kirby said that although his position as education commissioner
required him to defend the financing system in court, he had always
maintained it was inadequate.
   ``We simply must have bold leadership to make the tough decision
of increasing revenue so that we equalize upward ... to the level
of a quality education for all children,'' Kirby said.
   The governor was more cautious, though.
   ``It could be that we maybe need more money, but money in itself
is not the answer to public education,'' Clements said. ``Quality
education is the issue here.''
   Attorney Earl Luna, who represented several affluent districts
that intervened in support of the state, expressed disappointment.
   ``We were hoping the court would consider it as a legislative
problem and ... hold that, while the legislative solution was not
perfect, it was constitutional,'' Luna said.
   In its ruling, the court rejected arguments that reform in
school finance will reduce local control of education.
   ``An efficient system will actually allow for more local
control, not less,'' the court said. ``It will provide
property-poor districts with economic alternatives that are not now
available to them.''
   The opinion noted that similar rulings have been made in nine
other states. Texas is one of 11 states where school financing
systems have been challenged.
   Other states with active lawsuits or court orders concerning
school finance are Alaska, Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky,
Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon and Tennessee.

<HEAD>Five Years and Waiting in FBI Spy Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former FBI agent Richard W. Miller was in
prison on the fifth anniversary of his arrest even though his
conviction and life sentence for conspiring to commit espionage for
the Soviet Union has been dismissed.
   ``I think there's something very wrong with a system that allows
a man to be held five years without a fair trial,'' Miller's
attorney, Stanley Greenberg, said.
   A 20-year FBI veteran, Miller was arrested five years ago
Monday. He was subsequently convicted _ after two trials _ on
charges of delivering secret U.S. documents to his lover, Svetlana
Ogorodnikov. His first trial ended in a hung jury.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon sentenced Miller to two life
terms plus 50 years.
   But in April, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the
conviction, ruling that Kenyon had erred in allowing lie detector
evidence during the 1985-86 trial. The panel ordered a new trial
for Miller.
   In July, Kenyon refused a defense motion to release Miller on
bail pending the outcome of a government appeal. Kenyon ruled that
Miller was a flight risk.
   In August, the appeals court refused to reconsider its decision.
U.S. attorneys had the choice of appealing to the U.S. Supreme
Court or prosecuting again in district court.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Russell Haymen, who helped prosecute
Miller, did not immediately return telephone calls seeking comment
Monday.
   Miller, the only FBI agent ever convicted of espionage, spends
his time in prison taking computer classes and waiting to see
whether the government will try him again.
   ``He seems to be holding up better than you or I would,''
Greenberg said. ``He is a very stoic kind of fellow who takes what
comes his way, or goes with the flow, to use one of his
expressions.''
   At his trials, prosecutors depicted Miller as a bitter and
vengeful man who was repeatedly reprimanded for ineptitude on the
job. They said Miller was easily recruited the summer of 1984 by
Svetlana and her husband, Nikolay Ogorodnikov, Soviet emigres
living in Los Angeles.
   On Sept. 27, 1984, Miller walked into an FBI office and
confessed to having a relationship with Mrs. Ogorodnikov. He
contended that he was trying to redeem his career by infiltrating
the Soviet KGB.
   For the next four days, testimony revealed, Miller underwent
grilling by FBI agents while Mrs. Ogorodnikov made frantic calls to
his Lynwood home and FBI offices in Los Angeles and Santa Ana,
trying to find him.
   The two had planned a trip to Vienna to meet with Soviet
intelligence agents, prosecutors charged.
   He was placed under arrest Oct. 2, 1984.
   The Ogorodnikovs, as co-defendants, pleaded guilty and are
serving time in federal prison.
   Greenberg said he was confident Miller would get a new trial or
reach a ``realistic solution'' with the government.
   ``I think the government has always blown this case far out of
proportion to what it really is,'' Greenberg said. ``We're hopeful
as we start down the road again that there will be a more realistic
solution.''
   From prison, Miller writes frequently to his children, most of
whom have struck out on their own since his arrest, Greenberg said.
   Greenberg said he also receives ``nice phone calls and Christmas
cards'' from the Ogorodnikovs.
   ``Nikolay's very excited. He thinks he's going to get a new
trial if Miller gets his again. But he pleaded guilty,'' Greenberg
said. ``His biggest crime was being married to Svetlana.''

<HEAD>Taiwan Establishes Ties with Liberia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberia and Taiwan have normalized
relations 12 years after the African nation switched recognition
from Taipei to the rival Communist government in China, officials
say.
   The late Monday night announcement by Foreign Minister Lien Chan
represents a breakthrough for the Nationalist government's new
flexible policy of seeking diplomatic ties with countries that
already have relations with Beijing.
   Lien attributed Taiwan's diplomatic victory to its ``making more
progress politically, economically and socially'' than Communist
China.
   The official Broadcasting Corp. of China, quoting unnamed
sources, said Taiwan had agreed to offer Liberia a $200 million
loan. Foreign Ministry officials declined comment.
   The re-establishment of ties between Taiwan and Liberia comes
three months after Taiwan established ties with Grenada. China
subsequently suspended diplomatic relations with the tiny Caribbean
island.
   There was no immediate reaction from Beijing to Liberia's
decision.
   Taiwan's latest moves come after decades of diplomatic reversals
in which the overwhelming majority of nations chose to recognize
the Communists in Beijing instead of the Nationalists in Taipei.
   Both governments have claimed to be the legitimate ruler of all
China since the Communists defeated the Nationalists in a civil war
that ended in 1949.
   The number of countries with formal ties to the Nationalist
government has dropped from more than 50 in 1949 to 24, not
including Liberia, which is among the 134 countries that recognize
China.
   Chan told a news conference Monday night that Taiwan and Liberia
would sign a formal communique on setting up diplomatic ties in a
few days. The two countries agreed to pursue normalization in
January, he said.
   Communist Chinese leaders have criticized Taiwan's flexible
diplomacy as a plan to promote two separate Chinas, a claim the
Nationalist officials deny.
   Liberia, with a population of 2.5 million, is an agricultural
country that relies on the exports of coffee, lumber and rubber.
   Liberia imported $24 million of industrial products from Taiwan
in 1988. Its exports to Taiwan totaled $270,000.$

<TEXT>
   The Raleigh Times will stop publishing
after 110 years so its resources can be used to improve its sister
paper, The News &amp; Observer, said the publisher, who mourned the
Times as ``a daggone good newspaper.''
   ``It was a pretty wrenching decision,'' said Publisher Frank
Daniels Jr., who is also president of the News &amp; Observer
Publishing Co.
   ``The reader has voted, and what they have said is, they want
the N&amp;O, a morning paper, instead of The Raleigh Times, an
afternoon paper.''
   The Times will cease publication Nov. 30, Daniels said Monday.
   An internal task force that reviewed the performance of both
papers, reader preferences and other factors recommended closing
the Times as part of a plan to expand and improve The News &amp;
Observer, Daniels said.
   Afternoon dailies across the country have been in decline in
recent years as publishers have found it increasingly difficult to
make timely delivery to the suburbs and readers have opted for
television news in the evening.
   The News &amp; Observer has a daily circulation of 145,000, compared
with the Times' 21,500.
   ``Just not enough people wanted to read it,'' Daniels said. ``I
thought it was a daggone good newspaper.''
   ``For several years, we have watched as afternoon dailies in
metropolitan areas closed,'' the publisher said. ``We cannot make
the improvements The News &amp; Observer needs and still publish a
quality afternoon newspaper.''
   The additional staff will be used to improve The News &amp;
Observer's coverage of surrounding Wake County and nearby Durham,
Daniels said. That and other improvements could not be made as long
as the Times was being published, he said.
   Daniels said no layoffs are expected. The news staffs of the
papers were combined in 1987.
   The Times began in 1879 as the Raleigh Evening Visitor. After
merging with two competitors, it was renamed The Raleigh Times in
1901. The Park family of Raleigh purchased The Times in 1911, and
John A. Park served as editor and publisher for 44 years.
   The Times was sold to the News &amp; Observer Publishing Co. in 1955.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee is recommending a
major improvement in benefits for the most affluent 10 percent of
Social Security recipients who continue to work after retirement.
   The panel, which is writing a bill designed chiefly to reduce
the budget deficit, has agreed informally to raise by about $5,600
the maximum amount a person between the ages of 65 and 69 may earn
without having to give up a portion of Social Security benefits.
   That would boost the earnings limitation to about $14,500 a
year, committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told reporters
Monday.
   Bentsen said the committee, which was scheduled to begin work
this afternoon, had not resolved the two thorniest issues: whether
to reduce the tax on capital gains and whether Medicare
catastrophic insurance protection for retirees should be repealed
or only cut back.
   ``The (capital-gains) measure as passed by the House and
supported by the administration will not in my opinion pass the
Senate or the committee,'' Bentsen said.
   Several members of the committee have suggested alternative
capital-gains taxes. Bentsen said he was ``making no assumptions''
as to whether any of those will be approved.
   The committee, Bentsen said, is firmly behind allowing people
between the ages of 65 and 69 to earn more without losing a part of
their Social Security check.
   According to congressional aides, the earnings limitation
affects only about 10 percent of Social Security recipients. In
1986, only 600,000 beneficiaries had their Social Security checks
reduced because of earnings. The remaining 90 percent either did
not work or had wages below the exempt amount.
   Present law permits a person between 65 and 69 to earn up to
$8,880 in 1989 without losing benefits. The pensioner loses $1 in
benefits for each $2 earned above that level.
   The earnings limitation rises each year with inflation, and
starting in 1990, recipients will lose $1 for each $3 earned above
the limitation.
   Under the committee's tentative action, the earnings limitation
would be increased by about $2,800 in 1990 and $2,800 in 1991 in
place of the much smaller inflation adjustment.
   According to Bentsen, that would raise the maximum earnings
limit to about $14,500 in 1991. For the next $5,000 of wages, the
pensioner would lose $1 for each $4 of additional earnings.
   A person 70 and older loses no Social Security benefit no matter
how much is earned. Beneficiaries under 65 may earn up to $6,480
without giving up any part of the Social Security check.
   The House Ways and Means Committee has voted to raise the
earnings limit for ages 65 through 69 to $9,720 in 1990 and $10,440
in 1991.

<HEAD>Admiral Flies to Mediterranean for Hearing for Iowa Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of the Atlantic Fleet's Naval
Surface Force is conducting a disciplinary inquiry aboard the USS
Iowa, the battleship on which 47 sailors were killed in an April
explosion, Pentagon sources say.
   Vice Adm. Joseph S. Donnell III is conducting the non-judicial
inquiry to determine whether the captain and several other officers
should be punished, the sources told The Associated Press Monday.
   The Navy said after a lengthy study that gunner's mate Clayton
Hartwig ``most likely'' caused the explosion in the battleship's
No. 2 gun turret by inserting a detonator between two powder bags
   But the investigation led by Rear Adm. Richard Milligan also
alleged numerous lax procedures aboard the ship, including
unauthorized experimentation with extra-strength gunpowder and
projectile loads.
   Milligan said the officers had failed to qualify enough sailors
for their specific duties in the gun turret and that many safety
procedures had been circumvented.
   He recommended that Capt. Fred Moosally and four other
high-ranking men be relieved and disciplined. However, his
superiors decided the men should receive non-judicial punishment
through the mast procedure.
   Donnell, who was one of the endorsing officers of the final Iowa
report, countered Milligan's recommendation that the five men be
removed, arguing that the infractions amounted to ``a failure of
leadership'' on the captain's part but were ``a marked departure
from otherwise outstanding performance.''
   Donnell is expected to conduct his inquiries separately for each
of the men, and the procedures are expected to last several days, a
Pentagon source said. The USS Iowa is in the Mediterranean.
   Besides Moosally, the men include the ship's executive officer,
the weapons officer and a master chief petty officer who was found
to have experimented with the gun firings.
   The gunnery officer requested and received a transfer. A
separate procedure is expected to be conducted for him later, the
source said.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration says it hopes the
Soviet Union will help restart the stalled peace process in
Cambodia and ease the threat of revived civil war there.
   David F. Lambertson, deputy assistant secretary of state for
East Asian and Pacific affairs, spoke of a ``more constructive
Soviet role'' in Indochina after recent ``useful discussions about
Cambodia'' with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Testifying before a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee
Monday, Lambertson defended the U.S. policy of seeking a settlement
in Cambodia by backing Prince Norodom Sihanouk and continued
political and diplomatic isolation of Vietnam.
   He said the United States wants Moscow to press its allies,
Vietnam and the Vietnam-backed Cambodian government, to compromise
with Sihanouk and reverse the trend ``toward a military option'' in
Cambodia.
   Lambertson blamed the breakdown of the Paris peace conference on
Cambodia in August on what he called ``Vietnamese intransigence.''
   ``We plan to steadfastly maintain our support for the diplomatic
and economic isolation of Vietnam,'' he said.
   But East Asian and Pacific affairs subcommittee Chairman Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., accused the administration of pursuing a
``morally bankrupt'' policy of backing Sihanouk's demand to include
in an interim Cambodian government the communist Khmer Rouge,
blamed for the loss of more than a million Cambodian lives when
they ruled from 1975-78.
   Monday's hearing was part of a search for new policy approaches,
Cranston said.
   Khmer Rouge rule, dubbed Cambodia's era of ``the killing
fields,'' was followed by an 11-year Vietnamese occupation of
Cambodia that ended last month.
   Dith Pran, the Cambodian-born New York Times photographer whose
escape from his homeland was portrayed in the movie ``The Killing
Fields,'' testified that collapse of the Paris conference means
``Cambodians are being forced by their leaders to go to the killing
fields again.''
   Sihanouk, the other non-communist Cambodians and the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations all ``maintain that leaving the Khmer
Rouge completely out of the interim regime ... is certain to result
in a bloody civil war,'' Lambertson said.
   But Dith Pran said including the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia's
future government would be like allowing high-ranking Nazis in a
post-World War II German government.

   Former world middleweight champion Rocky
Graziano has been hospitalized after collapsing at home, according

   Graziano, 68, was taken to Lenox Hill Hospital on Sunday after
he ``went limp all over'' at his apartment, said his daughter,

   Doctors didn't immediately reveal a diagnosis.
   Graziano was born Thomas Rocco Barbella on the lower East Side.
He began his professional boxing career in 1942 and fought champion
Tony Zale for the middleweight title on Sept. 27, 1946.
   Zale won by a knockout, but Graziano knocked out Zale in six
rounds to win the title 10 months later. He lost it in June 1948
when Zale knocked him out in the third round of their third and
last fight.
   Graziano was the subject of the book ``Somebody Up There Likes
Me.'' Paul Newman portrayed Graziano in the movie of that name.

<HEAD>NIH Says Veterinary Drug Offers Hope to Colon Cancer Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Cancer Institute says a drug
used to fight worms in farm animals may be an important new device
against colon cancer in humans.
   ``I think this is an important advance,'' Dr. Samuel Broder,
director of the NCI said Monday in announcing strong results for
the drug when used in combination with an anti-cancer drug. ``We
might now be able to reduce the death rate due to colon cancer by
as much as one third.''
   Levamisole, a drug widely used to remove worms from the
intestinal tract of cows, horses, goats, sheep and even elephants,
was used with a cancer drug to dramatically increase the survival
rate among colon cancer patients, NCI officials said.
   The levamisole was used in combination with 5-fluorouracil.
   Levamisole is not approved for human medical treatment in the
United States, and currently is available to American physicians
only through a NCI research program approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. The drug, developed by a Belgium pharmaceutical
firm, is used in Europe, however, to treat intestinal parasites in
humans.
   The other drug, 5-fluorouracil, or 5-FU, has been a standard in
chemotherapy for some cancers for 30 years.
   The drug combination was used successfully in a small clinical
test and then expanded to a national clinical trial involving about
1,300 patients, under the direction of Dr. Charles G. Moertel of
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. The NCI sponsored the national
trial.
   Moertel said the findings showed that colon cancer patients at
an advanced stage of the disease called Duke C experienced about a
one-third reduction in death and cancer recurrence after five years
when compared to patients who received either no drugs or
levamisole alone. He said previous studies showed that 5-FU had no
effect on colon cancer.
   It was only the combination, said Moertel, that gave ``a
significant reduction in the death rate.'' Just how the two drugs
work together is not now understood, Moertel said.
   Until now, there has been virtually no successful treatment
available for Duke C colon cancer patients, he said.
   Duke C, or stage III of colon cancer, is named for a physician
who first characterized the progress of the disease. At this stage,
the cancer has penetrated the colon wall and spread to the lymph
nodes, but there are no tumor cells detected in other organs. Duke
C patients also have had the obvious tumors removed surgically,
along with the nearby lymph nodes.
   Broder said that about 110,000 patients a year are diagnosed
with colon cancer and 44,000 will die of the disease. About 21,000
of those deaths will be among patients who first received treatment
at the Duke C stage of the disease, he said.
   In the past, he said, medical science could offer such patients
only surgery and regular examinations to monitor the disease
progress. Five-year survival rate for these patients is 30 percent
to 40 percent.
   Among Duke C patients receiving the drug combination, 49 percent
were alive with no detected cancer recurrence after five years.
Among patients in the study treated with surgery solely, the
survival rate was 37 percent, he said.
   Moertel said the treatment has not been demonstrated to be
effective in other stages of the disease.

and national parks.
   ``We need to draw clear lines that development can work around
while saving some lands as parks and wildernesses,'' sponsor Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., told a crowded hearing Monday conducted by
the Senate Energy and Resources subcommittee on public lands,
national parks and forests.
   Congress in 1976 enacted the Federal Land Policy and Management
Act, which established the California Desert Conservation Area. The
Bureau of Land Management developed a management plan for the
California desert to balance the demands of environmentalists,
hunters, miners, ranchers, energy developers, tourists and the
military.
   However, Cranston said the BLM has ``failed to protect important
desert resources.''
   Citing a report by the General Accounting Office, Cranston said
the investigative arm of Congress found that the bureau ``has
frequently allowed the needs of competing interests, such as
recreation and commercial use, to take precedence over wildlife
interests when conflicts have arisen.''
   The bureau disputed that charge.
   ``GAO's report presents only a partial picture of BLM's wildlife
activities in the California desert,'' said Cy Jamison, director of
the bureau.
   Robert A. Sanregret, a representative of the Western Mining
Council Inc., said the legislation ``would destroy thousands of
private businesses and would, literally, make thousands of citizens
homeless.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may face
a revolt among rank-and-file Communist Party members, but his
reforms are likely to survive, according to a senior CIA analyst.
   ``Even if there is a temporary setback, I think the process of
reform will continue,'' Marc Zlotnik of the CIA's Office of Soviet
Analysis said Monday in a lecture at the Kennan Institute for
Advanced Russian Studies.
   His remarks reflected a general sense of uncertainty among
experts over the course of Soviet politics in the short term after
four years of often tumultuous reform since Gorbachev came to power.
   Asked to comment on Gorbachev's own description of a deepening
economic and political crisis and reference to rumors of a
conservative coup in Moscow, Zlotnik said: ``Some spark could set
things off ... to topple the senior leadership. But no one is in a
position to predict when it will come and whether it can be put out
quickly.''
   ``The crisis is really serious,'' Zlotnik said. ``But so far, I
think it is being managed pretty well.''

   With a Thursday deadline at hand, the United
States and Egypt are exerting heavy pressure on Israel to go along
with a proposal for preliminary peace talks with Palestinian
representatives.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak sounded upbeat Monday about
prospects for a peace settlement, saying a ``golden opportunity''
exists that must not be squandered.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has been campaigning
hard for a more flexible Israeli position on the issue, said Israel
should not feel threatened by the 10-point proposal for peace talks
set forth by Mubarak.
   The inner cabinet of ministers from Likud and Labor is to meet
Thursday on Mubarak's ideas amid deep divisions on how to proceed.
   Likud rejects Mubarak's acceptance of a U.S.-backed formula that
involves trading occupied land for peace and including people
deported by Israel in a Palestinian negotiating delegation. Labor,
led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, supports both ideas.
   Mubarak told reporters the essential next step in the peace
process is to persuade the Israelis and the Palestinians to enter a
dialogue ``without preconditions.''
   ``We won't get to peace until Palestinians and Israelis speak to
each other,'' Baker said.
   Baker regards the Egyptian plan as a complement to _ not a
substitite for _ Shamir's proposal for elections in which
Palestinians would select representatives to negotiate with Israel
on limited self-government in the occupied territories.
   Monday's White House session came amid new concern that settling
Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank could threaten peace efforts.
   Bush administration officials reacted coolly to an Israeli
request for $400 million in housing loan guarantees for about
100,000 Jewish emigres from the Soviet Union. Israeli officials
have said some dwellings probably will be in the West Bank.
   ``The United States policy is to oppose additional settlements
in the occupied territories,'' Baker said.
   Baker also said U.S. ability to assist Israel is limited by
``severe budgetary constraints.''

   A medical research laboratory targeted by
animal welfare activists faces a $2,500 for harassing two
Agriculture Department inspectors at the facility during a 1987
visit.
   The Agriculture Department's chief administrative judge, Victor
W. Palmer, on Monday ordered Sema Inc. to comply with ``every
provision of the Animal Welfare Act'' and not to interfere with
federal inspections.
   Animal rights activists claim the suburban Washington lab
mistreats its chimpanzees and other animals used in viral research
under contract with the National Institutes of Health.
   The two veterinary inspectors who work for the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service said company employees prevented them
from taking pictures of cages, decoding information about the
animals and driving away from the lab on June 29, 1987.
   In a follow-up report at the lab, the inspectors reported
finding deficiencies in sanitation that were ``suggestive of
violations'' of regulations, but concluded Sema did not violate the
welfare act.
   Sema President John Landon and his attorney declined comment on
the order until they saw it writing.
   The company has 35 days to appeal the decision.
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which is based in
Washington, has publicly shown films it claims were taken at Sema
during a burglary, allegedly by an underground animal rights group.
Chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall has also publicly criticized the
company about the size of cages and other treatment of chimps there.
   Sema had a $1.5 million-a-year contract with NIH for research
into simian AIDS and hepatitis at the end of last year and was
conducting experiments on nearly 500 monkeys, chimpanzees,
woodchucks and other animals. PETA has long complained that Sema
has one of the highest mortality rates for its animals in the
country, but the company denies that allegation.

   The dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen
in Tokyo Tuesday despite intervention by Japan's central bank,
while stock prices slipped.
   The dollar opened at 139.72 yen, up 0.42 yen from Monday's close
of 139.30 yen, and closed at 140.65 yen, up 1.35 yen. It traded in
a range of 139.70 to 140.68 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
lost 256.60 points, or 0.72 percent, to close at 35,366.37 points.
   Currency traders said the Bank of Japan intervened several
times, selling dollars for yen at about the 140-yen level.
   ``The dollar was moving slightly upward as market players
corrected their dollar-holding positions,'' said a trader with the
Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said participants were buying back dollars they had sold
earlier, following talks last week among monetary officials from
seven key currency nations, known as the Group of Seven. The
officials agreed to strengthen coordinated monetary intervention to
push the dollar lower.
   Tokyo investors were focusing on selling West German marks and
buying the yen, thus helping the dollar to strengthen against other
major currencies, the Bank of Tokyo trader said.
   But he said the Bank of Japan was likely to prevent a further
rise in the dollar.
   The amount of the Bank of Japan's purchases was not immediately
known. The central bank does not normally comment officially on its
market intervention.
   On the stock exchange, traders said many participants stayed on
the sidelines watching the currency market.
   Dealers said the weakening yen discouraged Japanese investors,
and the Nikkei index fell as they sold to take profits.
   An analyst for Yamaichi Securities, who spoke on condition of
anonmyity, said institutional investors also held back because of a
lack of trading focus.

<HEAD>Drama Over Marcos Body Part Of Filipino Political Tradition</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The standoff over where to bury
Ferdinand Marcos is the latest example of ``body politics'' _ a
Filipino game Corazon Aquino's supporters once played themselves to
rally a nation and topple a dictator.
   Rules of the game demand protracted wakes, vigils and novenas.
   Players include grieving relatives who regale reporters,
television audiences and crowds of spectators with tales of
injustice and appeals to respect Filipino tradition.
   The object is to play on the Filipino's almost mystical respect
for the dead to promote the cause of the deceased and the fortunes
of the living.
   Since Marcos died Thursday in exile in Hawaii, Manila radio and
television stations and newspapers have in daily reports showed the
grieving widow, Imelda, standing before the former president's open
coffin.
   Mrs. Marcos has vowed to do all she can to return her husband's
remains to his homeland, despite President Aquino's refusal to
allow his burial here.
   ``I also ask for your prayers to give me strength to that I will
see the victory of my struggle to clear the name of President
Marcos and the whole nation,'' Mrs. Marcos said in a radio
interview broadcast here today.
   The scene in Honolulu is an ironic parody of the events of six
years ago, after Mrs. Aquino's husband, Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr.,
was murdered moments after returning from the United States to
challenge Marcos.
   After the Aug. 21, 1983 slaying, the Aquino family held a
nine-day wake during which thousands of people filed by to view the
body, still dressed in the blood-soaked clothes in which Aquino
died.
   Perhaps two million people turned out for the funeral, as
Aquino's body was paraded over a 19-mile route aboard a 10-wheel
flatbed truck.
   The outrage over the killing galvanized anti-Marcos sentiment
and paved the way for the uprising which toppled the longtime
president and propelled Aquino's widow into the presidency on Feb.
25, 1986.
   Body politics has been played by lesser figures too.
   Marcos' mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, died on May 4, 1988. But
Marcos' followers hoped to use her death to dramatize their
leader's exile and embarass the government into allowing him to
return. The ploy failed.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos remains unburied, lying in an open casket in
Batac, 250 miles north of Manila. Die-hard Marcos' loyalists carry
on a vigil which has been largely forgotten.
   The military has also discovered the merits of body politics in
its campaign to discredit the Communist New People's Army, which is
waging a 20-year insurgency.
   Under Marcos, the military tried to hide figures on the number
of soldiers killed by both Communist insurgents and Moslem
guerrillas in the south. But no more.
   On Sept. 3, rebels killed 13 soldiers working on a highway
construction project in Quezon province. As commanders spoke of
this ``outrage,'' television cameras panned the flag-draped corpses
and grieving widows.
   The military also claims the rebels have been carrying out a
protracted purge of their ranks and have killed scores of party
members suspected of disloyalty.
   With the discovery of every ``killing field'' _ where rebels
allegedly bury the victims _ the military encourages television
cameras to film as bones are unearthed from shallow graves.
   At dinner-hour newscasts, Filipinos watch as elderly peasants
weep over the bones, supposedly of their sons and daughters
``executed'' by the rebels.

<HEAD>School to Teach Better Race Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CASSANDRA BURRELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A middle school has transformed itself into a
laboratory on ways to improve race relations where teachers hope to
erase past tensions and perhaps serve as a model for the rest of
the nation.
   ``Some kids' cultural upbringing is different. Some of it is
unconscious. We need to learn to understand each other better,''
says Robert Pipkin, principal of the Prospect Middle School Center
for Multiracial, Multi-ethnic and Multicultural Education.
   Prospect teachers _ and their sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade
students _ are learning the fine points of dealing with whites,
blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and Native Americans.
   The students, split almost evenly among whites and blacks, will
learn about the cultures of other races and ethnic groups in hope
they will find their differences enlightening rather than divisive.
   The school, in Pittsburgh's racially balanced Mount Washington
section, will retain its traditional curriculum, but also will
teach students to recognize racism and its consequences. Teachers
also will try to provide lessons free of racial bias.
   Another part of the program could prove more controversial.
   Since some studies indicate children of different races and
cultural backgrounds have different learning styles, teachers will
be taught to expand their repertoire of teaching methods, said
psychologist Stanley Denton, the Pittsburgh School District's
director of multicultural education.
   ``White children tend to be abstract learners. In the area of
mathematics, for example, they can learn by being exposed to a
formula,'' Denton said.
   Black children, in general, learn best when the lesson is
embedded within a context or accompanied by examples, he said.
   ``This is an oversimplification, of course,'' he said. ``There
are always wide variations and exceptions.''
   Attempts to put these theories to work elsewhere have offended
blacks.
   ``People tend to equate abstract learning with higher thinking,
which isn't the case at all,'' Denton said.
   Administrators hope the program will generate new ideas that can
be used in other schools in Pittsburgh and, perhaps, across the
country.
   ``We want a program that will celebrate diversity and encourage
kids to be proud of their background and knowledgeable about their
cultural heritage,'' Denton said.
   The first year of the program will involve mostly training and
planning. Next September, however, the center will begin projects
designed to enhance students' self-esteem, teach the histories of
different minorities and sensitize teachers to their own racial
attitudes.
   About 52 percent of the district's 39,500 students are black and
47 percent are white. One percent come from other minority groups.
Of Prospect's 625 students, 48 percent are black.
   The district invited teachers to apply to work in the new
program, and 90 percent of Prospect's teachers and staff are new to
the school. This year 35 percent, or 21, of the school's 59
full-time teachers are black and the rest are white.
   The idea for the changes sprang from a study that found black
male students in Pittsburgh got suspended from schools more often
than others.
   ``We also had a couple of incidents of racism,'' Pipkin said.
``We had some teachers making blatant remarks about Afro-American
kids and episodes between back and while students _ some racial
name calling.''
   Changes also were suggested by business and community advisers
concerned about black students' complaints of racial harassment at
colleges and universities, including Pennsylvania State University,
Indiana University of Pennsylvania and Carnegie Mellon University.

   Kitty Jordan, who took her name from a
slip of paper in her pocket when she showed up here in December
with little memory, discovered she probably is Ruth Ellish, a
divorced mother of three from Ohio.
   Investigators who struggled all year to help the black-haired,
brown-eyed woman find her true identity got a break Monday in the
form of a missing person report from Akron, said Detective Walter
Keeler.
   The discovery led to a phone conversation between ``Kitty'' and
Elise Shite, a sister of Ruth Ellish in Ohio, authorities said.
   ``She definitely feels that I am (Ruth Ellish),'' the mystery
woman said Monday night.
   ``She and our mother are coming down on Wednesday morning. ... I
don't know if I'll go back with them or not,'' said the woman who
still calls herself Kitty Jordan.
   Keeler said his office was fairly certain Kitty Jordan is
50-year-old Ruth Ellish, based on information provided by the Akron
Police Department and on her sister's recognition of Kitty's voice.
   Ms. Ellish disappeared from Akron on Dec. 8.
   Two days later, the mystery woman woke up in a Nashville motel
with a headache and bruises on one eye, her arms and legs.
   ``As to what happened and how I got here, we still don't know,''
she said. ``There's a 24- to 48-hour period that's still not
accounted for.''
   She said her newfound family told her Ruth Ellish had been under
a great deal of pressure, most recently because of ``personal
problems'' with her 18-year-old daughter.
   ``They said I had been suffering from migraine headaches. That's
about as much as we know at this point,'' she said.
   Nashville police appealed for help from the public last week,
saying they had exhausted all leads. Since then, they have followed
up on dozens of tips from people who read articles about Kitty,
whom doctors believe has amnesia.
   Kitty's only recollections were ``bits and pieces'' about an
abusive ex-husband, working in an office with computers and seeing
the Chicago skyline.
   ``She does want to remember and just can't,'' an exasperated Lt.
Tommy Jacobs said last week.
   On Monday, authorities filled Kitty in on details of the life of
Ruth Ellish, showing her pictures sent from Ohio of the woman, her
daughter and her two sons, ages 29 and 20.
   ``Right now to me, they're still just a bunch of strangers,''
she said.
   Ms. Ellish was a computer analyst at the Alltel-Western Reserve
Telephone Co., in Hudson, north of Akron.
   ``The police gave me a good deal of information this morning
which I couldn't remember,'' she said. ``Some of what they said
just absolutely went over my head. I think I was still in shock. My
mind isn't absorbing these things.''
   She spoke from the Family Life Center, a private women's shelter
where she has lived and worked as a cook.
   The mystery woman said she wouldn't decide about her future
until talking with her counselors and meeting the family of Ms.
Ellish.
   ``I'm still apprehensive,'' she said. ``I just don't know what's
back there for me.''

   Automakers criticized a congressional proposal to
extend California's tough auto exhaust standards to the entire
country as needlessly expensive and of doubtful value.
   The California rules ``were adopted for a unique part of the
country with a unique problem,'' said William Noack, director of
General Motors Corp.'s media relations office in Washington. ``Why
bring standards for that part of the country nationwide when the
need for them is not there?''
   The proposal emerged Monday from a subcommittee of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee on a 22-0 vote. It virtually assures
some form of tough new tailpipe emission controls, because the
Senate's clean air legislation is even stricter.
   Under the House plan, passed as a proposed amendment to a clean
air bill put forth by President Bush, California-style controls
would be phased in beginning with 1994 models and be in effect in
all states by 1996.
   Noack said the subcommittee plan wouldn't make the air any
cleaner than the administration plan, but will cost the consumer
more.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated the additional
emission controls would add $100 to the cost of each car.
   Ford Motor Co. Vice Chairman Harold Poling said his company
supported Bush's proposal, despite some reservations.
   ``However, this action goes well beyond that proposal,'' Poling
said of the subcommittee plan. Though the provisions would make
auto standards far more stringent, they would improve air quality a
mere 1 percent compared with Bush's proposal, he said.
   Poling also said there are serious safety questions about vapor
recovery systems that would be mandated under the provisions.
   Chrysler Corp. spokesman Tom Houston also criticized
subcommittee proposal. ``First, the proposed standards stretch the
limits of technological feasibility, and we presently lack
assurance that these standards can be met at the levels of
reliability and quality the American public demands,'' Houston said.
   Andy Bucksbaum, executive director of the Public Interest
Research Group in Michigan, praised the proposal.
   ``We're very encouraged by this compromise,'' Bucksbaum said.
``It's an excellent first step particularly in area of controlling
smaller pollutants.''

<TEXT>
   Zsa Zsa Gabor, convicted last week for
slapping a police officer, has filed suit against a neighbor,
claiming roots from his trees cracked her driveway.
   The Hungarian-born actress filed the lawsuit Monday in the Los
Angeles County Superior Court.
   She said she was forced to remove dried and overgrown brush
extending from the yard of Austin Young onto her property and to
install sprinklers and new plants at her own expense after Young
failed to clear the property.
   The lawsuit seeks at least $47,000 in damages and a court order
requiring Young to better maintain his yard.
   Young wrote in a June 1988 letter to Miss Gabor that he was
willing to arrange and pay for the driveway's repaving, but
couldn't reach her by telephone to discuss the work.
   On Friday, a Beverly Hills Municipal Court jury convicted Miss
Gabor of misdemeanor battery on an officer, driving with an expired
license and with an open container of alcohol in her Rolls Royce
Corniche.
   The charges stem from a traffic stop in which the actress
slapped Officer Paul Kramer.
   She could be sentenced to 18 months in jail. Sentencing is
scheduled for Oct. 17.

<HEAD>Government Orders Probe Into Shipwreck Tale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government ordered a probe
today into why searchers failed to find any trace of a capsized
yacht whose crew claims to have drifted four months off New Zealand
before being washed ashore.
   ``There are many discrepancies in their story,'' said Terry
Knight, head of the New Zealand Search and Rescue.
   The four say their 42-foot trimaran capsized in a storm June 3
and that they survived the 121-day ordeal huddled in the overturned
craft by spearing fish, eating seaweed and trapping rainwater.
   The four turned up over the weekend on Great Barrier Island, but
some officials have expressed skepticism about their story, saying
they appear too healthy.
   ``We needed a miracle and we got one,'' said John Glennie,
skipper of the sailboat, the Rose Noelle.
   Glennie said the trimaran left Picton, on the northern coast of
the South Island, on June 1 for a three-week Pacific islands cruise
to the Polynesian kingdom of Tonga.
   He told authorities the boat was flipped over by a huge wave in
a 60-knot wind on the third day of the journey and that the four
activated an emergency beacon after scrambling to retrieve radio
equipment, flares, clothing and food.
   ``It's an amazing story,'' said Knight. ``The area the yachtsmen
say they were in when they made their last radio message was not
anywhere near where the search was done.''
   The inquiry was announced by Transport Minister Bill Jeffries,
whose responsibilities include the Marine Division in charge of sea
rescue operations.
   Jeffries told reporters his department wanted to clarify why the
boat was apparenty hundreds of miles from where its distress signal
was sent and why the yacht's emergency beacon apparently operated
for a week well within range of an aircraft monitoring service
without being detected.
   ``They say they were just off the New Zealand coast but the
radio message we had put them hundreds of miles away at the
Kermadec Islands, nearer Tonga,'' Knight said. ``It was a very big
area to cover.''
   Alex Gibbs, a Marine Division official, told The Associated
Press there was some confusion about when and where the boat
capsized.
   ``It is curious,'' he said. ``Based on winds and sea currents,
it would make more sense if they were further north.''
   Gibbs said the yacht was smashed on the rocky coast of Great
Barrier Island, 60 miles northeast of Auckland, after the crew made
landfall on Sunday. He said the inquiry was normal procedure.
   The crew included owner and skipper Glennie, Phillip Hoffman and
Rick Hellriegal of New Zealand; and Jim Nalepka, 38, of Minneapolis.
   Glennie, responding to suspicions today the crew was too healthy
to have survived such an ordeal, told reporters: ``It's not a
hoax.''
   The crew members emerged Monday but without the salt water sores
typical of extended seawater exposure.
   Hellriegel, reunited with his family, breakfasted today on
bacon, eggs and mushrooms washed down with fresh coffee, said the
New Zealand Press Association.

<HEAD>OSHA Pushes to Protect Rescue Workers from Blood-Borne Diseases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration reportedly intends to push for regulations to
protect millions of rescue workers from exposure to AIDS and other
blood-borne diseases.
   The measure's estimated cost is $800 million, the highest figure
in the agency's history, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported
today.
   The regulations are needed because a ``cavalier attitude''
toward infections is increasing the danger of sickness and death
among health workers, said Dr. Joseph H. Coggin Jr., a consultant
to OSHA.
   An estimated 5.3 million nurses, police officers, ambulance
drivers, embalmers, firefighters and prison guards would be covered
by the regulations.
   ``In spite of a barrage of literature about the modern dangers
of laboratory-acquired infections and how to prevent them, workers
in the average laboratory today fail to faithfully wear protective
clothing, gloves and face shields,'' said Coggin, head of the
Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of
South Alabama medical school in Mobile.
   Coggin said he witnessed incidents in which employees' lunches
were kept in a refrigerator along with AIDS-infected blood samples,
a surgical assistant used a hallway telephone while wearing
blood-soaked gloves and janitors removed biohazardous waste in
unprotected street clothes.
   ``Most of these workers recognize the potential danger and even
lethal outcomes of a laboratory exposure to blood-borne viruses and
agents but yield to the pressure of getting the work done
quickly,'' Coggin said.
   Most health workers, Coggin said, appear to be unaware of
voluntary guidelines that the national Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta has suggested for handling contaminated blood.
   He said that without the required actions, workers in
laboratories, hospitals and research centers ``will continue to
have infectious disease transmitted needlessly through blood and
human materials in the workplace.''
   The CDC has reported 18 cases of infection with HIV, the virus
that can cause AIDS, as a result of workplace exposure, and an
estimated 12,000 health-care workers now contract hepatitis B every
year because of occupational exposure.
   According to the newspaper, OSHA has proposed requiring:
   _Gloves, face shields, gowns, fluid-resistant clothing and other
equipment for any workers who might be exposed to potentially
infectious materials.
   _Employer-paid vaccinations of all employees whose jobs exposed
them to hepatitis B, as well as follow-up examinations and blood
tests after exposure incidents.
   _Safety features such as double doors, easily washed surfaces,
areas for decontamination and sinks for washing in work areas where
hepatitis B or the AIDS virus is produced for research purposes.
   Any rules formulated by OSHA must be approved by the federal
Office of Management and Budget.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks Down In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar, after a six-day decline, rose sharply
against the Japanese yen in Tokyo today despite intervention by
Japan's central bank, while stock prices fell.
   The dollar closed at 140.65 yen, up 1.35 yen from Monday's close
of 139.30 yen. It opened at 139.72 yen and ranged between 139.70
and 140.68 yen.
   The dollar had fallen 5.70 yen in six trading days before
today's rebound.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
lost 256.60 points, or 0.72 percent, closing at 35,366.37 points.
   Currency traders said the Bank of Japan intervened several times
in the morning, selling dollars at about the 140-yen level, but did
not act in the afternoon, and the dollar rose quickly in the last
half-hour of trading.
   It was not immediately known how much the central bank sold. The
bank normally does not comment on its exchange market activities.
   ``There was no real reason to buy dollars, but the market still
seemed to be short of the currency. It looks like the market will
continue to support the dollar,'' said Minori Takeuchi, a trader at
Chemical Bank.
   Many players were sitting on the sidelines, awaiting the results
of a meeting of West Germany's central bank on Thursday, she said.
   There have been rumors that the bank will raise interest rates.
   Tokyo investors were focusing on selling West German marks and
buying yen, thus helping the dollar to strengthen against other
major currencies, said a Bank of Tokyo trader on condition of
anonymity.
   On the stock exchange, ``The rebound of the dollar didn't do
much to help the sentiment of the market,'' said a dealer at
Kleinwort Benson Securities, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
He said many investors were sitting on the sidelines watching the
currency markets.
   ``Many people seemed content to lock in the short-term gains of
the past few days,'' he said, referring to sales for profit-taking.
   Stocks that were strong last week, including securities,
insurance, railway and retailer sales issues, fell back.
   Shares in some smaller companies and warehousing firms rose
strongly.
   ``It wasn't all doom and gloom. It was mostly the big stocks
that were being hit'' in the market's decline, the trader said.

<HEAD>Black Tar Heroin Leads to Overdoses, Deaths</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rash of overdoses and deaths attributed
to particularly potent chips of ``black tar'' heroin has addicts
and occasional users alike terrified and frantically seeking
treatment, officials said.
   From Friday through Monday, three people died and dozens of
others were treated after they literally were knocked off their
feet and rendered unconscious after injecting themselves with the
most-popular form of heroin in the drug world.
   ``It's the talk of the neighborhood,'' said Eddie Franks,
director of the Facts on Crack program at Glide Memorial Church in
the Tenderloin district, where most of the overdoses occurred.
   ``What we're here for now is prevention and support while this
epidemic is going on,'' Franks said, adding that a 24-hour crisis
telephone line has been set up and will operate as long as
necessary.
   Police Inspector Sam Osborne said a dealer probably forgot to
mix the heroin with other materials to dilute its strength, which
normally is 6 percent to 9 percent pure.
   Tests showed the heroin had a 36 percent to 38 percent purity,
said Lt. Jim Mollinari. Since overdose cases fell off sharply, he
said, ``My guess is there's probably not much more out there.''
   Black tar, named for its color and gooey appearance, has become
the most commonly used heroin by San Francisco's estimated 15,000
to 18,000 addicts since coming on the scene about seven years ago,
said Dr. Alex Stalcup, medical director of the Haight-Ashbury Free
Clinic.
   It sells for about $20 a bag that can be broken into several
shots.
   The clinic generally treats about 120 people daily and turns
away about 10 or 15. Within a couple of hours Monday, it had turned
away almost 40, he said.
   ``The people who buy street heroin are literally playing with
their lives,'' he said.
   The fatalities were said to be men ages 35, 41 and 43. The San
Francisco Coroner's Office did not release names.
   Last week, federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents seized
2 kilos of black tar heroin at hotels near San Francisco
International Airport.

<HEAD>Voyager Proves Volcanism Still Active on Neptune's Moon Triton</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A geyser-like volcano blasting nitrogen
ice and gas five miles high was photographed on Neptune's moon
Triton by Voyager 2 in the craft's last hurrah of its grand
solar-system tour.
   The discovery, announced Monday as Voyager 2 formally ended its
two-month encounter with Neptune, proves Triton is the solar
system's third known object with active eruptions, scientists said.
The others are Earth and Jupiter's moon Io, which has
sulfur-spewing volcanoes and geysers.
   Photographs radioed to Earth when Voyager flew past Neptune and
Triton in August showed dark, plume-shaped deposits of material
lying on Triton's south polar ice cap.
   At the time, scientists believed the deposits were created by
volcanoes spewing gas and ice 12 to 20 miles skyward. They said
they believed the volcanoes were active or had been active during
the past few centuries.
   But it wasn't until late last week that closer examination of
pictures taken from 62,000 miles revealed an eruption in progress,
said Ellis Miner, deputy Voyager project scientist at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``We caught one in the act!'' he said.
   A National Aeronautics and Space Administration news release
called such eruptions ``geyser-like phenomena.''
   But Voyager's project scientist Edward Stone said, ``From the
standpoint of a major eruption, one would clearly discuss it as a
volcano.''
   He said a column of dark material rising five miles from the
surface can bee seen.
   On Earth, volcanoes erupt material that makes up the planet's
crust _ molten rock _ while geysers spew water.
   ``It's a semantic issue,'' said University of Arizona scientist
Brad Smith, head of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   The eruption isn't apparent in any single image of Triton, but
was recognized by examining several images taken from different
angles and analyzed through stereoscopic techniques, NASA said,
calling the discovery ``Voyager's last hurrah in its journey past
the planets.''
   Voyager 2's encounter with the solar system's fourth-largest
planet formally started Aug. 5 and ended Monday, when the one-ton
probe was 34.7 million miles past Neptune, traveling at 37,337 mph.
   The spacecraft was 2.83 billion miles from Earth, and traveled a
curved 4.46-billion-mile path since its launch in 1977. Voyager 2
explored Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.
   Although Voyager will continue to look back at Neptune until
December, Monday's formal end of the encounter was marked by the
activation of new computer commands replacing the program that
guided the craft and its cameras and instruments through the close
examination of Neptune.
   Voyager 2, like its twin Voyager 1, is expected to return
information to Earth for 25 or 30 more years before its plutonium
power generators fail. The probes will measure magnetic fields and
electrically charged particles in space as they search for the edge
of the solar system. Voyager 1 explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn
in 1980.
   Scientists don't know what causes the eruptions on Triton, which
is about four-fifths the size of Earth's moon and is the coldest
known object in the solar system, with a surface temperature of 400
degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   Stone said one possibility is that heat from sunlight penetrates
and is trapped below Triton's polar ice, evaporating nitrogen ice
into gas that powers the eruptions.
   The active volcano is the third and apparently the only active
type of volcanism discovered on Triton.

Congress</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Alaska's efforts to prevent oil and gas
exploration in the rich fishing grounds of Bristol Bay focused on
Congress as the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the state's
latest appeal.
   The court Monday left intact rulings that allowed the federal
government to sell $94 million worth of exploratory leases last
year on 5.6 million acres of the bay off southwest Alaska.
   ``It means, as we suspected, that the battle has shifted to
Congress, which is moving in the direction of protecting Bristol
Bay from development,'' said Randall Weiner, executive director of
the environmental group Trustees for Alaska.
   State Attorney General Douglas Baily said he was not surprised
by the court's action: ``We've been focusing on Congress, in part,
because we didn't want to trust all of our eggs in the basket of
the Supreme Court.''
   State officials, environmental groups and fishing organizations
have said the relatively small chance of finding large amounts of
oil under Bristol Bay is not worth the risk of an oil spill to fish
and wildlife.
   They also contend that a spill would do more environmental harm
there than the Exxon Valdez spill did to Prince William Sound. The
March 24 tanker disaster, the nation's worst oil spill, forced the
closure of several fishing areas.
   Bristol Bay supports the world's largest red salmon fishery,
worth more than $1 billion annually, and the largest herring
fishery in U.S. waters. It also is home to a majority of the
world's northern fur seals, the Pacific Gray whale population, and
millions of seabirds, geese and ducks.
   ``Bristol Bay is the only place we've opposed oil development,
and for one chief reason _ the risk to the fishery isn't worth the
potential oil spill,'' said Gov. Steve Cowper. ``The court's action
is disappointing, but shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.''
   An agreement in a House-Senate conference committee last week
would prohibit any drilling in the bay for a year, and require the
Interior Department to consider buying back the leases.
   Under the plan, any buy-back recommendation would be tied to the
results of an Interior Department study of the effects of the Exxon
Valdez spill. That study also would look at the adequacy of
spill-contingency plans for Bristol Bay development. Only Congress
could authorize the repurchases.
   The agreement is contained in the department's fiscal 1990
spending bill, which was expected to return to the House today and
the Senate by Wednesday for final approval, said Jane Robbins,
press secretary for Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
   The studies and Interior's recommendation are due by March 1991,
meaning no exploration is likely in Bristol Bay before then.
   Sue Flensburg, director of the Bristol Bay Coastal Resource
Service Area in Dillingham, said the congressional moratorium and
eventual repurchase of the leases represent the last chances to
protect the bay.
   ``At this point I'm pretty confident that it will make it
through the appropriations bill, and that's about the best we can
hope for at this point,'' she said.
   Weiner said the congressional effort is more significant in
light of Monday's court action.
   ``Bristol Bay is one of the world's most productive fisheries
and home to seven species of endangered mammals,'' he said. ``It's
one of the last places in this country that should be developed for
oil.''

<HEAD>Orders 6-Month Freeze on Auto Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California's insurance commissioner put an
immediate six-month freeze on auto insurance rates and said she
would set the size of voter-mandated rate rollbacks by the end of
the year.
   Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said Monday she ordered the freeze
partly in response to an announcement last week by Farmers
Insurance Group that it would raise auto rates by 5.9 percent Nov.
1. That would be one week before Proposition 103 gives the state
Department of Insurance authority to veto rate increases.
   Some other insurance companies indicated they had similar plans,
she said.
   ``The rate freeze I am imposing will protect consumers and clamp
a lid on any insurance company attempting to raise rates,'' she
said.
   Gillespie also said she would set industry-wide standards for
the rate rollback required by the proposition, and for future rate
approvals by her department, at hearings scheduled to start Oct.
30. She said the standards would apply to every insurance company
in the state.
   A court challenge to the freeze is ``a good possibility,'' said
David Fountain, spokesman for Farmers and State Farm, which have
formed the Personal Insurance Federation of California.
   The moves were applauded by consumer groups that had accused
Gillespie of trying to undermine the initiative, which was approved
by voters last November.
   ``We're on the road to a solution,'' said Nettie Hoge of
Consumers Union.
   In August, Gillespie said she would consider individually every
insurance company's request for an exemption from the proposition's
requirement of a 20 percent rate rollback, in order to implement a
state Supreme Court ruling guaranteeing insurers a ``fair rate of
return.''
   She also made statements widely interpreted as exempting 184
insurers from even being considered from a rollback _ companies
whose profit levels for auto, property and liability insurance were
below 11.2 percent. That represented a 15-year industry average,
Gillespie said.
   Gillespie told reporters Monday those firms ``were never
exempted.''
   Fountain said Farmers needed a rate increase because it was
suffering losses under a program in which insurers are randomly
assigned policies of high-risk drivers under rates set by the
state. But Gillespie said her department would address the
assigned-risk problem in a hearing Friday on a rquest for a 112
percent rate increase for the program.

   A man cut off one of his girlfriend's fingers
with a machete, then drove off and hit two people with his car
before crashing into a police station, authorities said.
   Sergio Vega, 39, gave police no motive for the attack, but said
he was upset at the prospect of being deported to the Dominican
Republic for a drug conviction, according to Sgt. John Clifford, a
police spokesman.
   Vega told police he attacked his girlfriend, Loida Rodriguez,
30, early Monday as she slept in his apartment, authorities said.
   He then drove away and struck 14-year-old Alexandra Cohen as she
was walking to school, dragging her for a block, authorities said.
Shortly afterward, he struck Ana Ramos, 35, on a street corner,
police said.
   Vega drove on until his car slammed into the station, Clifford
said. He got out of the car and surrendered, Clifford said. Vega
was taken to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center for minor
injuries.
   Police found Ms. Rodriguez unconscious and bleeding in the
apartment. Her right index finger had been severed, three fingers
on her left hand had been cut and she had slash marks on her head
and face, Clifford said.
   She was listed as stable at Lincoln Hospital.
   Cohen was in serious condition, while Ramos was treated at a
hospital and released.
   Vega was charged with attempted murder, two counts of vehicular
assault, leaving the scene of an accident, reckless endangerment
and driving under the influence of a controlled substance, believed
to be cocaine, Clifford said.

<HEAD>Government-Opposition Talks Over Rent Boycott Called Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government officials have for
the first time negotiated with leading anti-apartheid leaders about
ending the 3-year-old rent boycott in Soweto, the country's largest
black township.
   Business Day, a Johannesburg daily, today described the talks as
the highest-level bargaining session ever held between the
white-controlled government and major anti-apartheid activisits.
   It quoted one unidentified activist as calling Monday's parley,
in which the government offered to waive some unpaid rent, ``an
unprecedented breakthrough'' because the activists were accepted as
primary negotiating partners.
   The boycott has been one of the most effective protests by
blacks since a national state of emergency was declared in June
1986.
   Soweto, home to an estimated 2.5 million blacks on the outskirts
of Johannesburg, has been the hardest-hit of several townships
affected by rent boycotts. It has lost more than $100 million in
revenue.
   The government delegation, led by Transvaal Province
administrator Danie Hough, met in Pretoria with Soweto city
councilors and prominent activists, including Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu; the Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the
South African Council of Churches; and Albertina Sisulu,
co-president of the United Democratic Front anti-apartheid
coalition.
   Hough said the activists ``have a very important role to play''
_ an unusual government acknowledgement of the influence enjoyed by
militant leaders within black communities. He said the delegations
would meet again.
   The government could not accept demands to write off all unpaid
rent, but a partial waiver could be negotiated, Hough said.
   He offered to negotiate ways to transfer ownership of rented
houses to their occupants, another demand of the activists.
   Hough said a demand that Soweto and Johannesburg be unified to
share tax revenue was ``probably impractical.''
   Chikane, the activists' spokesman, said the meeting showed that
``we can resolve problems by talking rather than relegating the
solution to the police.''
   Police have tried periodically to evict boycotters from their
homes. One such campaign, in August 1986, led to confrontations in
which more than 20 blacks were killed by police gunfire.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Four inches of snow covered parts of the northern Rockies early
today and Minneapolis got its first frost of the year.
   Light snow fell across parts of Idaho late Monday, coating the
Island Park area and the mountains on the Montana border. Gusty
north winds were sweeping the central mountains of Idaho this
morning, with sharply reduced visibility in some areas and up to 4
inches of snow.
   A snow advisory was in effect early today for the southern
mountains and passes of Montana where 2 to 6 inches were possible
at elevations above 5,000 feet.
   High winds buffeted parts of Nevada and Arizona, with gusts
reaching 43 mph at Kingman, Ariz.
   Temperatures dipped below freezing in southeastern Nebraska and
the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the only part of Minnesota that had
yet to get frost.
   In Miami, meanwhile, temperatures soared to 94 on Sunday,
topping a nine-year-old record high for the date, and Waco, Texas
had a record 101 degrees.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across southern Florida
on Monday evening, with rain extending from coastal North Carolina
to New England. Rain also fell in eastern Ohio, and from northern
California to western Wyoming.

   Photos from pre-1920 and posters from before 1960 still are
needed, Francesconi said.
   ``Most of those are just hanging on people's walls. I can't
believe that there aren't posters of Mark Twain, Woodrow Wilson,
Toscanini out there,'' Francesconi said.
   The call for historic items already has turned up other goodies,
including the silver trowel used by Andrew Carnegie's wife, Louise,
to lay the cornerstone in 1890 and a ribbon that was cut on opening
night in 1891.
   Bennie Goodman's daughter, Rachel Edelson, donated one of her
late father's clarinets, and lots of photographs and recordings
have surfaced.
   The items will be shown in special exhibitions in 1990 and 1991,
and some eventually will be displayed in a Carnegie Hall museum.
   Francesconi has most of the house programs, but is missing those
from 1892-98, 1928-37 and 1944-47.
   ``There are things out there that people assume we have,'' he
said. ``Maybe once upon a time we did, but when the hall was
threatened with demolition in the late 1950s, we know stuff
disappeared. They wanted to take souvenirs before Carnegie Hall was
gone for good.''
   Francesconi is also hoping to turn up correspondence relating to
the hall.
   ``People have responded from all over the country, it's just
been fantastic,'' he said. ``But we're fighting the clock now _
we've given ourselves until March to look for material.''

<HEAD>Out-of-Court Settlement Reached in Young Paternity Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRETEL WIKLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Coleman Young has agreed to pay $11,700 a
year and create a $150,000 education trust for a 6-year-old boy to
settle a paternity suit, a judge announced.
   The out-of-court settlement was called generous by lawyers for
both sides and resolves the matter five weeks before Detroit's
mayoral election, in which Young is seeking a fifth term.
   Under terms of the settlement, announced Monday by Chief Wayne
Circuit Court Judge Richard Kaufman, Young will pay $225 a week _
$11,700 annually _ to Joel Loving until he turns 19. He also will
set aside enough money to create a $150,000 trust for the boy's
education.
   ``We feel that it's a rather good settlement for Joel Loving,''
said Noel Keane, lawyer for the boy's mother, Annivory Calvert.
``We have virtually established his welfare through age 18 and
certainly given him a nice little stipend to start his life.''
   Calvert, 34, a former Detroit city official who is now director
of public works for the city of Fontana, Calif., sued Young in
January. In May, laboratory tests proved the four-term, 71-year-old
mayor was the boy's father.
   ``From this point on, I'll be able to get on with the rest of my
life,'' Calvert said.
   Lawrence Charfoos, Young's lawyer, also said the settlement was
generous.
   The mayor ``has done as fine a job of taking care of his son as
any son can ask of a father,'' he said.
   The trust will pay $10,000 installments each year from the boy's
19th through 24th birthday. When he turns 25, the trust will
terminate and he will receive the remaining $90,000. The payments
require the boy, who turns 7 on Oct. 18, him to pursue a
post-secondary education, Keane said.
   ``We hope beyond (the money) Young will establish a father
relationship,'' Keane said.
   Charfoos said Young's relationship with his son is ``obviously a
significant concern'' but wouldn't discuss what Young plans to do.
   The settlement means Young's income tax returns will remain
private, along with the amount of money in his campaign coffers,
estimated to be about $5 million before the primary.
   The mayor is running for a fifth, four-year term against Tom
Barrow, an accountant whom Young defeated soundly four years ago.

   A murder warrant was issued Monday for William Lee Slagle, 42, a
Samford University professor sought in the Sept. 21 slaying of
20-year-old Rex B. Copeland, Shelby County Sheriff Buddy Glasgow
said.
   Authorities received a handwritten letter Monday in which Slagle
admitted killing Copeland, Glasgow said.
   ``He sort of apologized about what had happened,'' he said.
   The pair had argued about preparation for a debate in Iowa,
Glasgow said. Slagle ``didn't feel like he was studying enough,''
the sheriff said.
   ``I know these folks are serious about their debating and it
could lead to a heated argument,'' Glasgow said, ``but it doesn't
sound like something worth killing for, does it? I think there'd be
more to it.''
   Copeland was found dead in his apartment Sept. 22. He had been
stabbed several times in the chest.
   Investigators have been trying for about a week to question
Slagle, and have been told he left town, Glasgow said. His mother
lives in San Antonio and he has a brother in Dallas, the sheriff
said.

<HEAD>Panamanian Opposition Leader Questioned And Freed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DIVISA, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government freed opposition leader
Ricardo Arias Calderon and eight of his colleagues after
questioning them about their campaign to slash government revenues
during a 20-hour detention.
   But all nine face charges including ``crimes against the state,
crimes against the administration of justice and crimes against the
national economy,'' Attorney General Carlos Villalaz said.
   The most serious of the accusations carries a 15 to 20 year
prison sentence, according to the penal code.
   Arias, a vice presidential candidate in May elections, was
arrested Sunday in Veraguas province, 180 miles west of the
capital. He and the the others had been promoting the
anti-government campaign they call ``not one penny more''.
   Authorities called it ``economic insurrection,'' and questioned
him for four hours before he was freed on Monday, he said.
   The opposition is urging Panamanians to delay paying taxes and
utility bills and to boycott the state-controlled lottery and
gambling casinos.
   The campaign aims to withold essential funds from the government
run by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Panama has already been badly
hurt by U.S. economic sanctions.
   Former presidential candidate Guillermo Endara is in the 14th
day of a hunger strike aimed at encouraging Panamanians to join the
campaign.
   ``When the regime reacts in such an exaggerated way to a
non-violent campaign, it is revealing the impact of the campaign,
the weakness of the regime and its bad conscience,'' Arias said in
Divisa, 150 miles west of Panama City.
   He said the group was arrested Sunday by about 20 people
carrying AK-47 assault rifles and revolvers.
   ``Physically, there was no mistreatment, but there was
psychological mistreatment,'' he said.
   A statement by Endara said the opposition ``reiterates its
promise to keep fighting for the establishment of a democratic
system of government and full respect for human rights by the
peaceful means we have been following, despite the escalation of
violations and attacks from the dictatorial regime.''
   Villalaz said four other opposition activists were detained
Sunday in Chiriqui province, 240 miles west of Panama City and the
Defense Forces said they remained jailed.
   Arias was one of two opposition vice presidential candidates in
May 7 national elections the government annulled after returns
showed the opposition winning by a landslide.
   The United States imposed sanctions on Panama after Noriega was
indicted on U.S. drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges in
1988. Noriega denies the charges.
   The sanctions included witholding taxes owed to Panama for use
of the canal and banning U.S. companies from doing business with a
list of Panamanian individuals and enterprises.
   Washington considers Endara and his running mates Panama's
legitimate leaders.
   Noriega named his longtime friend, Francisco Rodriguez,
provisional president on Sept. 1, the day the former president's
term ended.

<TEXT>
   A federal drug agent, his wife and a
businesswoman pleaded innocent to conspiracy and money-laundering
charges involving hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in real
estate and rare coins.
   Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Dennis Harker, his wife,
Mary Ann, and businesswoman Susan K. Terry entered their pleas
Monday before a federal magistrate and were scheduled for trial
Dec. 4.
   Harker is a DEA agent in Miami; Ms. Terry owns SKT Construction
Co. in West Des Moines. Harker formerly lived in West Des Moines
and the trio have described themselves as high-school friends.
   U.S. Magistrate Celeste Bremer freed the three, subject to a
$100,000 penalty if they fail to appear for trial.
   In addition to tax offenses, they are charged with conspiracy
and with structuring bank deposits to keep them below $10,000.
   A federal law designed to catch drug-money launderers requires
banks to report deposits larger than $10,000.
   The indictment doesn't refer to drugs.
   The indictment alleges the Harkers had more than $1 million in
transactions during years they reported only a fraction of that
income for income tax purposes. It says Ms. Terry and Harker set up
a company which funneled cash to real estate investments and rare
coin transactions.
   Harker faces up to 40 years in jail if convicted on all counts,
while Ms. Terry faces up to 30 years. In addition to jail terms,
the Harkers face Internal Revenue Service penalties if convicted on
the tax charges.

<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger,
testifying in a libel lawsuit against a Pulitzer Prize-winner
Seymour Hersh, said he doesn't believe former Indian Prime Minister
Morarji Desai was a CIA informant.
   But under cross-examination in U.S. District Court Monday,
Kissinger admitted he couldn't be absolutely sure Desai didn't
provide information to the CIA because he wasn't told the names of
informants.
   Kissinger was subpoenaed to testify in the $100-million libel
trial brought by Desai against Hersh.
   Desai contends Hersh, 52, libeled him in his 1983 book on
Kissinger, ``The Price of Power.'' Hersh wrote that Desai was a
paid informant for the CIA and a valuable ``asset'' to the U.S.
government during the administrations of Lyndon Johnson and Richard
Nixon.
   To prove libel, Desai's attorneys must convince the six-member
jury that Hersh knowingly printed false, negligent or malicious
material about Desai.
   Desai, 94, is too ill to attend the trial and gave his
deposition previously via 81 hours of videotape.
   Kissinger testified Monday that Desai was not a CIA informant.
He said he had been told by former CIA Director Richard Helms that
he ``was on safe ground'' in saying that.
   ``To the best of your knowledge did Mr. Desai provide any
intelligence information to the United States in 1971?'' asked
plaintiff's attorney Cyriac Kappil.
   ``Not to the best of my knowledge,'' said Kissinger.
   Kissinger testified that in 1971, the U.S. government believed
India was about to invade West Pakistan, now known as Pakistan,
based on intelligence reports. Kissinger became national security
advisor in 1969 and served as secretary of state from 1973 to 1977.
   Under cross-examination by Hersh's attorney, Kissinger said he
wasn't told the names of paid CIA informants.
   ``You don't know the name of a single person who's gotten such
funds, correct?'' questioned defense attorney Bud Nussbaum.
   ``Correct,'' Kissinger replied.
   ``Is it correct that you don't know whether, in fact, government
officials said that to Mr. Hersh?'' Nussbaum later asked, referring
to Hersh's contention that government sources had identified Desai
as a paid informant.
   ``Or whether they existed,'' Kissinger replied. ``I know nothing
about them.''
   Kissinger was the awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 for his
part in ending the war in Vietnam.
   Hersh won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 1970
for his reporting on the My Lai massacre in Vietnam.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Calls for Economic ``New Deal'' for Third World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borrowing rhetoric from Franklin Roosevelt,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said a new worldwide
Great Depression is looming and called for a ``New Deal'' for Third
World debtor nations.
   ``Right before our eyes the world is sliding into a deep
economic depression,'' Shevardnadze said in a speech Monday to the
Foreign Policy Association.
   ``The debt of the Third World countries, the interest they have
to pay and the pace of their economic development _ are these not
the signs of an impending catastrophe?'' he asked.
   Developing nations have a $1.3 trillion foreign debt, mostly to
banks in the industrialized Western nations.
   Many Third World nations are unable to pay even the interest on
their debt, and their economies are stagnating as their scarce
funds are used to repay debt rather than build their economies.
   ``Radical new steps are needed, a kind of New Deal,'' said
Shevardnadze, speaking in Russian with the help of a translator.
   He said the United States and his country should share advanced
technology with the developing world, and said ``some debt'' should
be forgiven, a concept already being advanced by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady.
   The Soviet Union holds almost none of the developing world's
debt.
   Shevardnadze compared the Soviet Union's current social upheaval
and economic travail with the Great Depression in America, when
radical sentiment grew and many Soviet Communists predicted the
imminent downfall of capitalism.
   ``In 1929, a powerful and confident state took an economic
nosedive. There were bread lines in New York's Times Square and
tents of the jobless huddled along Riverside Drive.
   ``In Washington, troops were fighting the Bonus Army that had
invaded the capital. People were dying in demonstrations, strikes
and riots,'' said Shevardnadze, adding that the same is happening
in his country today.
   The Soviet Union's ``economic system is undergoing an
adjustment,'' he said. ``Something similar happened in the United
States 60 years ago.''
   But he added, ``so long as there is the will, the understanding
of the situation and the determination to change things for the
better _ and we certainly have them _ the economy can remedy its
ills.''
   Shevardnadze predicted that nations would one day compete ``not
for political supremacy or spheres of influence but for access to
water, fresh air and even a green lawn. Such conflicts could be
caused by demographic problems, hunger and poverty among part of
the world's population, or by epidemics of infectious disease.''
   During a question-and-answer session, Shevardnadze declined to
say whether the Soviet Union is likely to renew diplomatic ties
with Israel any time soon.
   He also ducked a question on Soviet policy toward the flow of
refugees from East Germany to West Germany, saying ``those two
countries will be able to sort out that problem.''

   The dollar rose in early European trading today
despite earlier interventions by the Bank of Japan in East Asian
markets.
   Gold prices were little changed.
   Foreign currency dealers said repeated dollar sales by the Bank
of Japan, estimated in the market to total $800 million, did little
damage to the dollar-yen rate.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.35 yen to a closing 140.65 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 141 yen.
   Dealers in Europe said the market is unwilling to shift
positions much ahead of the Thursday meeting of the Deutsche
Bundesbank's central bank council, which is expected to hike key
German rates by at least half a point.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _ 1.8827 West German marks, up from 1.8750
   _ 1.6335 Swiss francs, up from 1.6240
   _ 6.3885 French francs, up from 6.3595
   _ 2.1248 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1140
   _ 1,377.22 Italian lire, up from 1,366.50
   _ 1.1775 Canadian dollars, up from 1.7772
   In London, the dollar rose slightly against the British pound.
It cost $1.6106 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6175 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $365.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $366.50. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $365.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $365.40 down from $366.40 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 75 cents to close at a bid
$366.50.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.23 a troy
ounce, unchanged from late Monday.

   A woman has the right to retain two homes
used in drug sales if she can prove she opposed her husband's
deals, a federal appeals court ruled.
   Monday's ruling by a three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals sets a precedent in protecting the privacy of a
married couple, said John Paul Garhart, attorney for Jane DiLoreto.
   U.S. District Judge Gerald Weber ordered the property forfeited
after determining Mrs. DiLoreto knew her husband was selling drugs
from the houses.
   But the appeals court said Weber should have allowed Mrs.
DiLoreto to argue she opposed her husband's use of the homes. The
court also said Weber improperly considered hearsay evidence in
making his decision.
   Garhart said Mrs. DiLoreto, the mother of four, faced a dilemma:
either break up the family or continue living with her husband in
their Erie homed despite his drug dealing.
   ``The government would have us carve so deeply into the marital
relationship for so little gain in the war on drugs,'' he said.
   Garhart said the appeals court seemed to be ``trying to make the
statute comport to the real world.''
   The 3rd Circuit placed the burden of proof on Mrs. DiLoreto and
gave the district court leeway to decide whether she will need any
evidence beyond her denials to support her defense.
   DiLoreto's husband, Richard, 32, was convicted Aug. 10, 1988, of
conspiracy to sell $1 million worth of cocaine and marijuana, two
counts of using a telephone in the conspiracy and failing to report
income from cocaine sales.
   Last month, he was sentenced to five years in prison without
parole.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Constance M. Bowden would not comment on
the decision.

<TEXT>
   A judge sentenced Israeli peace activist
Abie Nathan today to six months in prison for violating an Israeli
law by meeting with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Nathan, who pleaded guilty to the charge last week, said he
would fight to overturn the law ``even from my prison cell.'' He
received a one-year suspended sentence in addition to the jail term.
   The 63-year-old Nathan operates the pirate radio station ``Voice
of Peace'' from a ship in the Mediterranean.
   Dressed in black pants and a black shirt, Nathan stood silent as
Aharon Fass, deputy president of the Ramle Magistrate's Court, read
the sentence.
   He told reporters later that his jailing would not halt his
efforts for Arab-Israeli peace.
   ``If somebody thinks I'm going to stop ... they're in for big
surprises,'' he said. ``I hope that public opinion and the people
in the streets will understand that this law is an obstacle to
peace.
   ``I will continue even from my prison cell to protest against
this law ... and immediately after prison I shall continue to speak
to the enemy,'' he said.
   The sentencing came as arguments raged in Israel's coalition
Cabinet over whether to agree to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
call for Israel to hold peace talks with Palestinians approved by
the PLO.
   Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO, which it calls a
terrorist organization.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc opposes
meeting a PLO-approved delegation, but the left-leaning Labor Party
accepts the plan.
   The meetings would be a first step toward resolving the
21-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. AT least 575 Arabs and 40 Israelis have died
in the revolt.
   Nathan pleaded guilty Wednesday to meeting with Arafat and other
PLO activists in Tunisia and France in September 1988.
   He told the court he knew he was violating a 1986 amendment to
the anti-terror law that prohibits holding meetings with terrorist
organizations.
   The court ruled that Nathan could start his sentence after the
Yom Kippur Jewish holiday on Monday.
   Nathan faced a three-year sentence but the few people convicted
as violators have had sentences commuted to public service. The
judgment said Nathan had more responsibility as a public figure.
   Defense lawyer Pinhas Marinsky said Nathan would not appeal the
sentence.
   The court judgment said of Nathan, ``No matter the good of his
intentions or his motives, it cannot release him of his criminal
responsibility ... In a democratic state, it's inconceivable to
take the law into your own hands.''
   Nathan is best known for his dramatic trip to Cairo in 1964 to
try to persuade Egypt to make peace with Israel. In 1978, he went
on a 45-day hunger strike to protest building Jewish settlements in
the occupied territories.
   The Indian-born Nathan first met Arafat in 1982 when he traveled
to Lebanon during the Israeli siege of Beirut in an unsuccessful
attempt to gain freedom for a captured Israeli soldier.

<TEXT>
   The governor of Puerto Rico denied promising a
government contract to officials of the Wedtech Corp. in a meeting
arranged by Rep. Robert Garcia, who is on trial for allegedly
selling political favors to the company.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez-Colon was called by the prosecution Monday
to testify in U.S. District Court about a September 1985 meeting
with Garcia and Wedtech officials at the governor's mansion in San
Juan.
   In earlier testimony, former Wedtech vice chairman Mario Moreno
said Garcia's wife, Jane Lee Garcia, arranged the meeting. He
testified that the governor promised to ``take care'' of the
contract and do whatever he could to help Wedtech.
   Hernandez-Colon confirmed the meeting took place but denied he
made any promises to the Wedtech officials there, Moreno and
Wedtech founder John Mariotta.
   ``In no way did I say I was going to give you this contract,''
he testified. ``That was beyond my authority.''
   Garcia, a 56-year-old Bronx congressman, and his 48-year-old
wife are charged with conspiring to do favors for Wedtech in
exchange for $185,000 in checks and interest-free loans and a
diamond and emerald necklace.
   One of the favors they are accused of performing was arranging
the meeting with Hernandez-Colon. Wedtech officials sought the
meeting because they wanted to win a contract to build ferry boats
for the U.S. territory.
   The governor testified that he may have suggested to officials
considering the ferry contract to consider Wedtech's offer to build
a shipyard in Puerto Rico and offer jobs to Puerto Ricans if the
company won the contract. Unemployment in the territory then was
21.8 percent.
   Under cross-examination, Hernandez-Colon said he didn't believe
anything improper took place at the meeting.
   A prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michele Hirshman, asked
Hernandez-Colon whether he would think differently if he knew that
one month earlier, Garcia had asked Wedtech for a $20,000 loan that
would be issued to his sister but was actually for the Garcias.
   ``If I were in fact certain of that as a fact, my opinion would
be changed,'' he said.
   The Garcias have pleaded innocent to charges of extortion,
conspiracy, bribery and receipt of illegal gratuities. If convicted
of the most serious charge, extortion, they face up to 20 years in
prison.

   Soviet Defense Minister Dimitri Yazov, making
his first visit to the United States, is meeting with President
Bush and touring the Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg, Pa.
   Pentagon officials said Yazov's trip today to the battlefield
where Union troops turned back Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederate
soldiers in a key, bloody battle was prompted by his interest in
the war between the states.
   Yazov met Monday for more than four hours with Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney at the Pentagon, officials said.
   A senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
described the talks as ``relaxed, candid, generally non-polemical,
informative.'' The goal of the talks, the official said, were to
``improve understanding between the two sides,'' as well as
``enhance stability and predictability.''
   The main topics of discussion were ``how national security and
defense decisions are made in the two countries,'' as well as
military strategies, defense spending, regional conflicts and arms
control negotiations, the official said.
   Specifically, U.S. officials sought information about the Soviet
Union's promise to make unilateral troop reductions and to cut the
defense budget by 14 percent.
   ``The Soviets gave us some details. ... You always learn
something new,'' the official said, but he declined to provide
details.
   Asked if Cheney and his advisers were confident about Soviet
pledges to scale back defense spending, the official said, ``We'll
have to see.''
   Yazov's visit grew out an invitation extended by former Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci when the two met in Europe near the end of
the Reagan administration.
   In addition to meeting with Bush and visiting Gettysburg, Yazov
also was to speak today at the National Defense University at Fort
Myer, Va.
   On Wednesday, Yazov will visit Camp Pendleton, a Marine training
base in Southern California. He'll visit Luke Air Force Base in
Arizona on Thursday, then fly to Fort Bragg, N.C., on Friday. Later
Friday, he'll return to Washington for a news conference with
Cheney.

   A man on trial on charges of planting 13
bombs around buildings and bridges was motivated by a rivalry with
a legislator who long ago beat him out for roles in high school
plays, a prosecutor said.
   ``This is a drama that started a number of years ago,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Stanley Powell said during opening
arguments Monday. ``It started in the mind of John Marion Hubbard,
a non-conformist who didn't believe in authority.''
   Hubbard, 31, is charged with making and planting the bombs found
in 1988 in Salem, a community of 6,000.
   None of the bombs exploded, but three ignited and fizzled. No
one was injured.
   Hubbard could be sentenced to 285 years in prison if convicted
of conspiracy, illegal possession of dynamite, 14 counts of making
bombs and 13 of attempting to destroy buildings and bridges used in
interstate commerce.
   ``This was a cowardly, terroristic act that held the city
hostage,'' Powell said. ``It still holds the city hostage.''
   Defense attorney Paul J. Watts contended the government's case
was based largely on circumstantial evidence and ``exaggeration,
drama, theatrics and no substance.''
   Powell said the government would introduce tape recordings in
which Hubbard boasted there were only two people in Salem smart
enough to manufacture the bombs _ he and Jerry Conrad, 42, who
worked with Hubbard at a factory.
   Conrad was convicted Sept. 5 on the same counts Hubbard is
charged with and was expected to testify for the government in
Hubbard's trial.
   Powell said the largest of the 13 bombs, containing 54 sticks of
dynamite, was found behind the law office of state Rep. Frank
Newkirk Jr. The prosecutor said Hubbard had a rivalry with Newkirk
that dated to their high school days, when they competed for
theater roles.
   ``He was traditionally beat out in almost every instance by
Frank Newkirk Jr. The feelings built up in Hubbard,'' Powell said.
   The prosecutor said Hubbard regularly wore camouflage. ``He
calls himself a survivalist. He calls himself antagonistic. He
calls himself a radical, and that's what he is,'' Powell said.
   Watts told jurors they would have to decide whether the devices
found around Salem were ``in fact bombs or were they something
designed to scare.''
   Watts said his client has ``a boatload of emotional problems and
substantial alcohol problems. When he's drinking, he brags, he
lies, and he exaggerates.''

<TEXT>
   Five amateur astronomers are preparing for an
undreamed-of opportunity to go eyeball to eyeball with the universe
using what will be the world's most powerful space telescope.
   In a gesture of appreciation for scientific contributions by
hobbyists using backyard telescopes, the Space Telescope Science
Institute has offered 20 hours of observing time on the Hubble
Space Telescope to projects designed by amateurs.
   The telescope, to be launched on a space shuttle in March, is a
joint project of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
and the European Space Agency. The project, based at Johns Hopkins
University, is expected to cost about $750 million and has been in
planning stages for a decade.
   For someone who is not a professional astronomer, the odds of
getting to use the telescope are comparable to George Jetson's
chances of getting a raise from his tightfisted boss at Spacely
Sprockets.
   ``I would guess every amateur astronomer would love to use it,''
said one of those selected, James Secosky, a science teacher from
Rochester, N.Y. ``I never thought I'd get to use an instrument like
this.''
   But astronomy is one of the few scientific fields in which
amateurs make significant breakthroughs.
   For example, Edwin Hubble, the American astronomer for whom the
telescope is named, developed his theory of the expanding universe
in cooperation with Milton Humason, a former janitor, mule driver
and high-school dropout.
   ``In actuality, outer space begins in your back yard. All you
need is a good pair of binoculars to get started,'' said Pete
Kandefer, an electrical engineer from New Hartford, Conn., who also
was chosen.
   Others selected include a computer expert and a homemaker.
   Professionals already have overbooked time on the telescope, the
first major optical telescope that will be permanently stationed in
low Earth orbit, said Ray Villard, an institute spokesman.
   The 24,000-pound instrument, about the size of a bus, has a
2.4-meter mirror that will gather enough light to enable
researchers to make images of things that are 25 to 50 times
fainter than the dimmest object previously seen.
   Free of the atmosphere's distortion of distant light and the
Earth's tendency to absorb the extreme ends of the light spectrum,
the telescope will produce pictures 10 times clearer than anything
available on the ground, Villard said.
   ``If your eyes were as good as the telescope, you would be able
to see a dime 20 miles away _ and know it was a dime,'' Villard
said.
   Secosky, 42, is interested in why Jupter's moon Io sometimes
appears brighter as it emerges from the planet's frigid shadow. He
thinks his observations may detect evidence of frost forming on the
moon.
   Kandefer's regular job is working on flight controls and
guidance sensors, but the 42-year-old engineer spends his free time
trying to learn about steller magnetic fields 10 times stronger
than the sun's.
   The only woman in the group, Ana Larson, 41, of Seattle, was
half a dozen years into an accounting career when she decided to
take time off to raise her two children and fell in love with
astronomy through University of Washington correspondence courses.
   Her goal is to find huge planets taking form around stars, a
process scientists suspect is occurring but cannot prove because it
is so difficult to distinguish any object that close to a star's
brightness. Larson hopes to find planets five to 10 times larger
than Jupiter that release enormous amounts of energy, detectable to
a telescope as heat.
   Ray Sterner, a 37-year-old computer scientist at Hopkins, will
test his theory that luminescent arcs discovered in a distant
galaxy cluster are made of stars. Most astronomers consider such
arcs to be optical illusions caused by gravity bending starlight.
   John Hewitt, who works at a science museum in Berkeley, Calif.,
hopes to detect a hypothetical mass of primordial material
surrounding a star where comets could take form.
   ``We aren't professional scientists and we would not qualify as
observers under the regular procedures,'' Hewitt said. ``This is an
incredible opportunity for an amateur astronomer on what is
esentially the most capable astronomical instrument ever created.''

<HEAD>Lebanese Deputies Seek Balanced Power-Sharing Formula to End War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALY MAHMOUD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanese legislators today debated
changing the way their government is structured to provide greater
power sharing between warring Moslems and Christians.
   The members of the Lebanese parliament are considering
``balancing and overlapping powers'' of a Christian president, a
Sunni Moslem premier and a Shiite Moslem parliament speaker,
conference sources said.
   Conflicts among these Lebanese factions have been feeding the
civil war that broke out in April 1975 and has ravaged the nation,
claiming the lives of an estimated 150,000 people.
   Most recently, Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun in March
sparked six months of lethal shelling when he declared a ``war of
liberation'' against the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon, accusing
them of siding with the Moslems.
   A Arab mediating team made up of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and
Algeria, acting on mandate of the 22-member Arab League, arranged a
cease-fire Sept. 22 that generally has been holding.
   Sixty-three of the 73 surviving members of the parliament have
been meeting in this Saudi mountain resort since Saturday to
discuss a plan drafted by the Arab League team for ending the
sectarian strife. It calls for political reforms and later Syrian
withdrawal.
   Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal steered the
deputies away from Christian demands that Syria withdraw before
reforms are agreed, to concrentrate on the division of power in the
Lebanese government, long dominated by Maronite Christians.
   The conference sources said they expected the result to be
essentially ``a mechanism of check, recheck and countercheck'' with
a view to averting dictatorship or the supremacy of one religious
faction over the others.
   But the debate indicated a continuing difference of views.
   Sources said several deputies rallied behind Maronite Christian
leader George Saadeh in advocating that the authority of the
powerful president, a Maronite under the present unwritten national
accord, be left unchanged.
   ``It would be hard on us to render our president a mere
distributor of medals and decorations,'' Saadeh was quoted as
telling the session.
   But pro-Syrian Moslem deputy Zaher Khatib told deputies ``we are
not in the process of shifting powers from one religious faction to
another, we are trying to curtail the powers of a dictatorial ruler
and entrust them to a council of leadership (the cabinet of
ministers).''
   A compromise called for continuing the presidential powers but
abolishing the tradition of apportioning senior civil service slots
along sectarian lines, now favoring Christians who dominate the
military, judiciary and economy.
   The deputies met in closed session 10 miles away from the press
center where reporters were restricted.
   One pro-Syrian deputy, Najah Wakim, unexpectedly showed up at
the press center late Monday and said ``opinion gaps among the
legislators on the powers of the president have been bridged, the
general atmosphere of discussions is favorable, and we are
hopeful.''
   He refused to elaborate and left the press center abruptly.
   Sources said Oct. 21 has been tentatively fixed as the date for
a formal session of parliament in Beirut to ratify the new charter
that would replace the unwritten accord of 1943.
   Two weeks later, the deputies would then meet to elect a new
president to replace Amin Gemayel, whose term ran out last
September. Parliament was unable to meet to elect a successor and
rival administrations sprang up led by Aoun and Moslem Prime
Minister Salim Hoss.

<HEAD>Shamir Aide Suggests Labor-Likud Compromise In The Works</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A top aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
said today that Israel's two governing parties may head off a
crisis over the Egyptian peace plan by agreeing to hold talks on
the issue with Americans and Egyptians.
   In Tokyo, visiting PLO chief Yasser Arafat told the Japanese
prime minister that the PLO favors opening Israeli-Palestinian
talks through Egypt, officials said. Israel expressed
disappointment over Japan's invitation to Arafat.
   A compromise between the center-left Labor Party and the
right-wing Likud bloc could defuse a tense situation before an
inner Cabinet meeting Thursday on Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's offer to arrange preliminary peace talks between
Palestinians and Israelis.
   The compromise also could reduce American pressure on Israel to
accept Mubarak's peace efforts. Mubarak met Monday in Washington
with President Bush, and said Israel should not squander a ``golden
opportunity'' for peace by rejecting his plan.
   In the occupied territories, meanwhile, troops today clashed
with Palestinian stone-throwers, wounding four people, one
seriously, Arab reports said. The army said it was checking the
reports.
   At least 123 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as
suspected collaborators during the 21-month uprising against
Israeli occupation. More than 580 others have died in clashes with
soldiers and Israeli civilians. Forty Israelis have been slain.
   The political feud in Israel centers on objections by Likud,
headed by Shamir, to U.S.-backed Egyptian proposals for Israel to
negotiate with a team of Palestinians before holding elections in
the occupied territories.
   Labor, headed by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, supports the
Egyptian idea, believing it the only way to break an impasse in the
peace process.
   Shamir balks at Egypt's proposal to include two Palestinians
deported by Israel in the delegation. He feels this would be
tantamount to opening the door to the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which Israel views as a terrorist group.
   Shamir's top political aide, Yossi Ben-Aharon, indicated in an
interview with army radio Tuesday that the prime minister may be
open to a compromise that would involve holding more exploratory
talks on the question.
   Asked whether Shamir would agree to a three-way meeting of
American, Egyptian and Israeli representatives over the composition
of a Palestinian delegation, Ben-Aharon replied:
   ``Theoretically yes, because it sounds reasonable for such a
tripartite meeting to hold a preliminary discussion over carrying
out Israel's political initiative.''
   He stressed that any talks with Palestinians would require prior
agreement by the Arabs to Shamir's peace plan published last April,
which calls for elections in the disputed lands pending
negotiations for an interim settlement. He ruled out PLO
involvement.
   U.S. officials have been pressuring Israel to accept the
Egyptian proposals as a basis for continuing the stalemated peace
process.
   In Tokyo, a senior Foreign Ministry official said Arafat told
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu he ``positively appraised'' an
agreement by Bush and Mubarak to promote the peace process and to
support Mubarak's peace plan.
   The PLO has not yet issued an official position on Mubarak's
plan. It objects to the fact that no mention is made of an
independent Palestinian state.

   ``Kung Fu'' actor David Carradine has been
sentenced to two days in jail and a month on a road maintenance
crew for drunken driving.
   Carradine, 48, on Friday also was ordered to do 100 hours of
community service and placed on three years' probation.
   The actor was arrested Sept. 8 after his vehicle was seen
straddling the center line, and his blood-alcohol level was
measured at 0.17 percent, more than twice the legal limit of 0.08,
said Deputy City Attorney Lisa Kissel.
   Carradine pleaded no contest to driving under the influence of
alcohol.
   The actor starred in the films ``Death Race 2000,'' ``Wheels of
Terror'' and ``Lone Wolf McQuade'' and played a martial arts
disciple in the 1970s TV series ``Kung Fu.''
   He admitted a previous conviction for driving under the

<TEXT>
   Communist leaders had nothing to do with the
reprinting of an article that accused maverick Boris N. Yeltsin of
going on a drinking and buying binge in the United States, a
Politburo official said.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda reprinted the biting article
from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica on Sept. 18 in what many
Yeltsin supporters saw as an effort by party leaders to discredit
the burly, silver-haired populist.
   Several days later Pravda apologized, saying the allegations in
the story had not been proven.
   In an interview broadcast Monday on official television,
Politburo member Vadim A. Medvedev denied that top party officials
put Pravda up to publishing the article.
   ``No instructions were given to the Soviet press,'' Medvedev
said in a summary of his remarks distributed by the Tass news
agency.
   Other newspapers were discouraged from publishing the same La
Repubblica piece, he said.
   Yeltsin, elected to the the new Congress of People's Deputies,
has rankled Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top
leaders with persistent calls to push Gorbachev's reform program
faster, and has accused the party apparatus of organizing a
campaign to try to discredit him.
   He was forced out of his job as Moscow Communist Party chief in
November 1987 after criticizing the party at a Central Committee
meeting, and later lost his post as a candidate, or non-voting,
member of the ruling party Politburo.

   Premier Li Peng today told former Secretary of
State Alexander Haig that Richard Nixon showed great foresight in
developing China-U.S. ties.
   Li also praised Henry Kissinger and Haig, saying ``their
contributions in this regard will go down in the annals of
Sino-U.S. relations,'' the official Xinhua news agency said.
   Haig, a former Kissinger aide who served under Nixon, is now a
private citizen and president of an international consulting
agency. He is the most prominent American to visit China since the
June 3-4 military crackdown on student-led demonstrators that took
hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives.
   The United States has since stopped all high-level official
contacts and suspended arms sales to China, bringing relations to
one of their lowest points since relations were normalized 10 years
ago.
   Haig, in Beijing to attend a business symposium, has been given
a cordial reception by the Chinese. They invited him to sit on the
Tiananmen Gate rostrum with China's top leaders Sunday evening to
watch celebrations for the nation's 40th anniversary.
   Li described Haig as an ``old friend of the Chinese people.''
   In recent days Beijing, while blaming Washington for the rupture
in ties, has urged that good ties be restored.
   Nixon is much admired here because he saw the strategic and
diplomatic importance of China and initiated the normalization of
relations in 1972 even though China domestically was still in the
throes of the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution.
   The Xinhua report said Li and Haig also discussed China's
domestic situation, and Li said he hoped U.S. and Chinese
businessmen would increase cooperation.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders began meeting
today to discuss ways to overhaul their image and win support of a
citizenry that has embraced the new Solidarity-led government.
   The party, the first ever to lose control of a Soviet bloc
government, is even considering changing its official name _ the
Polish United Workers Party _ as part of its effort to improve its
standing with the populace.
   Opposition candidates virtually swept all seats available to
non-Communist candidates in June's partially free elections.
Pro-Solidarity lawmakers eventually put together a coalition with
parties that were once allied with the Communists, resulting last
month in the first non-Communist government in the East bloc.
   In 1993, elections are to be fully democratic, and the
Communists are trying desperately to find a place in the new
Poland, which is embracing democratic reforms in a scramble to
salvage its collapsing economy.
   A survey released at the start of today's Central Committee
plenum showed that fully 72 percent of the party members favor
changing its name to reflect a change in image and purpose.
   Party leaders were expected to set a date and an agenda for a
party congress, which would enact the changes recommended by the
Central Committee. The congress would be a meeting of 1,000 to
2,000 delegates elected from among the 2 million rank-and-file
party members.
   The congress is expected to be set for mid-February, said a
party official, demanding anonymity.
   The party official said the internal party survey, in which more
than half the members took part, showed there was a strong danger
that the party could split.
   Party chief Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has warned that a split could
end the party. Accordingly, the plenum has adopted the slogan
``Unity at Any Price.''
   The official described the split within party ranks as being
between the leadership and the rank-and-file members, who favor
radical reform, and the ``middle level'' party organizers who want
to maintain a traditional party.
   The party official said the goal is to create a party that will
be attractive to voters in the 1993 elections. The party hopes to
do well enough in the voting to emerge as the dominant partner in a
leftist coalition, he said.
   Party Secretary Leszek Miller said the party is inviting society
to ``create the party with us,'' and that the party must strive to
find an identity which will give it a popular base.
   ``The question is whether the Polish United Workers Party can
fulfill the aspirations of the part of Polish society which is
left-leaning,'' he said.
   The plenum also is expected to support internal party democracy,
a state-dominated economy for Poland, and instigate a shakeup of
the ruling Politburo. It would be the second leadership shuffle
since July, the official said.
   ``If we remain in unity for three months, then we exist and we
will win,'' the official said. ``If the party is destroyed, then
the left does not exist for practical purposes for many years.''
   The pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reported today that
the draft resolution for the plenum called for development of a
``humanitarian, democratic and effective socialism.''
   On the economic front, the draft favors a multi-sector economy
dominated by the state-run economy. It opposes selling off state
enterprises, a chief economic goal of the Solidarity-led government.
   The draft also ``obliges all party cells to create conditions
for free expression of different views,'' the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods rebounded 2.9 percent in August after falling in July to
their lowest level in eight months, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable manufacturered goods totaled a seasonally adjusted
$237.2 billion following a 2.0 percent decline in July to the
lowest level since last November. Orders rose 0.6 percent in June.
   The report was the latest in a string of indicators showing that
the nation's economy continued to grow modestly last summer,
despite earlier fears that efforts to control inflation could steer
it into a recession.
   If the July weakness in manufacturing had persisted, it could
have led to layoffs and a rise in the unemployment rate.
   Shipments of manufactured goods rose 5.6 percent, the sharpest
increase in the current economic expansion that began in 1982.
Shipments had fallen 2.3 percent in July, the sharpest fall since
March 1986.
   Inventories, on the other hand, gained only 0.3 percent, the
smallest increase in two years. Inventories posted a 1.2 percent
gain in July, the biggest jump in five years.
   If inventories increase without a corresponding gain in new
orders, it could signal production cutbacks in the future as
factories attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots.
   However, unfilled orders declined 0.3 percent, the first drop
since a 0.1 percent fall in February 1987, indicating decreased
demand for goods.
   Orders for durable goods, ``big-ticket'' items expected to last
more than three years, rose 3.9 percent in August. That was a
slight revision of the Commerce Department report last week that
durable goods orders, boosted by robust automobile sales, had
rebounded 3.8 percent for their steepest advance this year.
   Orders for non-durable goods advanced 1.8 percent.
   About half of the improvement in durable goods orders was
attributed to the transportation sector, which rose 6.9 percent on
the strength of auto sales despite a decline in aircraft sales.
Non-electrical machinery, which includes computers, was up 9.3
percent.
   Orders of electrical machinery fell 2.1 percent and primary
metals declined 1.8 percent.
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of
business investment plans, orders fell 10.1 percent in August after
rising 5.9 in July.

<HEAD>Stevens Disqualifies Self from Abortion Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the Supreme Court's abortion rights
supporters is not taking part in a key abortion case before the
court in its 1989-90 term.
   Justice John Paul Stevens disqualified himself from the Illinois
case, one of three the high court is considering this term, for
unstated reasons, court spokeswoman Toni House said Monday.
   Stevens had not disqualified himself when the justices agreed
last July 3 to review the case. But a minor court order issued
Monday in the Illinois case, which deals with abortion clinic
regulations, noted that Stevens did not participate.
   His absence will not change the outcome of the case if the
justices line up as they did last July when voting 5-4 to let
states make abortion harder to get.
   Stevens was one of the dissenters.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor still is the key vote. If she votes
against the Illinois law, the outcome could be a 4-4 ``pro-choice''
victory. If she votes in favor of the law, the outcome could be a
5-3 anti-abortion victory.
   A 4-4 split would not set any legal precedent outside Illinois.
   The case focuses on a state law that would require abortion
clinics to add services and equipment now found only in hospitals.
   The law could force many clinics to close down, and could add up
to $50 to the cost of an abrtion performed in the first three
months of pregnancy.
   In invalidating the law, lower courts said it violated a portion
of the 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade that limited state regulation
over first-trimester abortions.
   Illinois officials are not asking the justices to use the
Illinois case to reverse Roe vs. Wade, but legal experts say the
court's ruling could chip away at the trimester-by-trimester
approach taken in the 1973 decision.
   The two other abortion cases under high court study this term
focus on parental notification requirements for unwed minors
seeking to end their pregnancies in Minnesota and Ohio. Stevens has
not disqualified himself from those cases.
   The Illinois case is Turnock vs. Ragsdale, 88-790.

<TEXT>
   It took a police roundup on Main
Street to get a quorum of 50 for a Town Hall meeting in this
village in the Berkshires.
   Town officials appealed to officers when faced with a room of
empty seats for Monday night's meeting on whether Stockbridge
should join an area recycling pact.
   Police Chief Richard Wilcox stationed cruisers with lights
flashing in front of Town Hall and had officers pull over cars and
check for Stockbridge citizens. Anyone who admitted living here was
escorted into Town Hall.
   Emergency calls also went out to two fire companies and a
parent-teachers meeting at the school in this small town used by
Norman Rockwell to illustrate the ``Freedom of Speech'' in his
series of paintings ``The Four Freedoms.''
   ``After a brief cattle drive we rounded up the 32 we needed,''
Wilcox said today.
   The chief said that officers learned from previous roundups not
to let citizens talk their way out of attending.
   ``We hear more excuses than the judge does when someone comes
before him with a traffic ticket,'' he said. ``You'd be amazed how
many people are in the pajamas at 8 p.m. when you telephone.''
   Once inside, the reluctant participants didn't have to tarry. It
took citizens less than 15 minutes to approve the plan.
   ``Monday night football is a lot of competition when there's
nothing special on the town meeting agenda,'' Wilcox said.

   Sales of new homes fell 0.4 percent in August,
dropping back slightly from a huge double-digit gain in July, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that new single-family homes were
sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 755,000 units in
August, following a 16.1 percent gain in July, the largest increase
in nearly three years.
   The July sales increase was the largest monthly advance since
September 1986, when sales climbed by 22.9 percent. The revised
July annual rate of 758,000 also was the highest level since
December 1986, when new homes were sold at a rate of 784,000 units.
   Analysts had credited the July advance to a decline in
fixed-rate mortgages which had fallen to 9.81 percent by the end of
that month from a peak of 11.22 percent last March.
   But rates edged back up to 10.22 percent by the end of August,
according to a monthly survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Co., contributing to the decline in home sales that month.
   The August decline was the third so far this year, but the first
since last March although sales were unchanged in June.
   Sales for the first eight months were down 2.7 percent from the
same period in 1988.
   The report on new home sales in August followed a report last
Friday that sales of existing homes rose 3.3 percent that month to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units.
   President Ira Griben of the National Association of Realtors
said the improvement in existing home sales reflected buyers taking
advantage of declining interest rates.
   The Commerce Department report today said the median price of a
new home was $122,900 in August, up 6.0 percent from $116,000 in
July. The median is the point where half of the homes sold for more
and half for less.
   The average price of a new home rose 14.6 percent to $162,300.
   New home sales in the Northeast declined 0.9 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 107,000 units. Sales had jumped
50 percent to 108,000 units in July.
   Sales in the Midwest were down 27.9 percent to 93,000 units
after rising 26.7 percent to 129,000 units a month earlier.
   Sales in the South rose 6.2 percent to 310,000 and were up 6.6
percent in the West to 244,000 units.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Reportedly Will Approve Extraditions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court will vote to approve
President Virgilio Barco's decrees allowing extradition of top drug
suspects to the United States and confiscation of their property,
national television reported.
   The television program TV Hoy, quoting court sources, reported
Monday night that a majority of 24 justices on the Court supported
the decrees.
   The deadline for the court to rule was today, but normally
several days pass before court rulings are made public.
   Seven bombs exploded in Colombian cities Monday night, two in
the Carribbean coast city of Barranquilla, three in the port city
of Santa Marta and two in the capital of Bogota, national police
said.
   Two people were injured in Barranquilla and two more in Santa
Marta, the police said. They were part of a daily wave of bombings
presumably set by drug traffickers.
   A Supreme Court ruling allowing extraditions would strengthen
the Barco administration in its war against the drug lords, and
would help allay fears that the court could undermine the anti-drug
crackdown.
   TV Hoy said, however, that the court would declare
unconstitutional an additional decree allowing the Colombian army
to raid drug traffickers' property at will.
   It said the court will support the government's right to
confiscate property from drug traffickers but will require that it
go through judicial channels.
   The court will not decide on the legality of property already
seized, leaving that issue for lower courts, TV Hoy said.
   As of a week ago, the army had seized 1,056 homes, ranches,
mansions office buildings and other property allegedly belonging to
drug traffickers.
   The administration's main weapon in the drug war is its power to
extradite suspected drug figures who have repeatedly shown their
ability to escape justice in Colombia.
   The United States has a list of 80 Colombians it wants
extradited to face drug charges, but it has disclosed the names of
only the top 12.
   In 1984 the Supreme Court, ruling on a technicality, declared
extraditions to the United States unconstitutional.
   The court has not dealt favorably with other important Barco
decrees. Before Barco declared war on the traffickers Aug. 19, the
court had knocked down seven decrees he issued in attempts to deal
with both guerrillas and drug traffickers.
   The most important of earlier decrees declared unconstitutional
was one creating a special tribunal within the Supreme Court to
deal with drug trafficking and other cases that present security
problems for lower court judges.
   Barco wanted to remove certain cases from the jurisdiction of
the lower court judges, who often have been threatened or killed
while handling drug trafficking cases.
   In the last 10 years 220 court employees, including 41 judges,
have been killed, many of them by drug traffickers.

   A free-lance cameraman was summoned to meet with
CBS executives today to answer charges he faked Afghan combat
footage aired on Dan Rather's ``CBS Evening News,'' according to a
published report.
   The New York Post today quoted an unidentified source as saying
Mike Hoover flew to New York from New Zealand for the interview and
would be accompanied by an attorney at the meeting.
   A CBS News spokeswoman today declined to say if the Hoover was
meeting with executives of the news division. David Burke, CBS News
president, was out of his office and not available for comment, his
secretary said.
   The Post reported last week that footage broadcast by CBS in
1984 was fake _ that Hoover had staged scenes of guerrilla sabotage
and had made a Pakistani jet fighter on a training run appear to be
a Soviet plane bombing Afghan villages.
   As a free-lancer, Hoover sold the film to CBS.
   CBS News president David Burke said last week, ``It is the goal
of CBS News in every instance to gather and report the news
accurately, fairly and with integrity. In the case of the Afghan
war, we believe we have done so.''

<TEXT>
   Cambodian guerrillas battled to
take a government-held town in northwestern Cambodia today, Western
and guerrilla sources said.
   The Khmer People's National Liberation Front and two other
guerrilla factions launched what they called a ``general
offensive'' against the pro-Hanoi government on Saturday. They
claimed to have overrun three towns and many other military
positions.
   The guerrillas called it their biggest victory in about 11 years
of guerrilla warfare.
   Vietnam, which previously fought alongside Cambodian government
forces after invading the country in 1978, says it withdrew its
troops a week ago.
   Thailand's Foreign Ministry claimed today that it held five
Vietnamese soldiers in Thailand's Chanthaburi province who were
captured in Cambodia since the pledged pullout.
   However, the Thai navy, which is responsible for the southern
part of Thailand's border with Cambodia including Chanthaburi, said
this was untrue.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Prachadavi Tavetikul said he planned
to show the Vietnamese to the press on Thursday, even though Capt.
Buncherd Phunchoren, a Royal Thai Navy spokesman, said there had
been no arrest or detention of any soldier since Sept. 20.
   In the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet heavy shelling and
automatic weapons fire could be heard all day to the north and to
the south across the border in Cambodia.
   Western sources on the frontier following battlefield movements
said the guerrillas were concentrating their forces on the town of
Kandoun, inside Cambodia some nine miles from Thailand. The sources
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The guerrillas also were attempting to prevent the resupply of
government positions, they said.
   No reliable reports of casualties have emerged either from the
guerrillas or the government. Phnom Penh official media have not
commented on the most recent fighting.
   Ieng Mouly, spokesman for the KPNLF in Bangkok, said the
offensive was a coordinated effort between the three guerrilla
factions; his own, those loyal to exiled monarch Prince Norodom
Sihanouk and the radical communist Khmer Rouge.
   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
during its rule from 1975 until its forces were ousted by the
Vietnamese in late 1978.

   South Carolina today banned shellfish
harvesting and warned against swimming in the ocean and rivers,
saying Hurricane Hugo had left waters choked with sewage.
   Workers also resumed efforts today to reopen a bridge to the
state's devastated resort islands, and officials ordered
construction of an eight-mile-long sand dune to protect the beach
from high tides later this month.
   As tons of supplies poured into the state, relief officials said
they were awash in clothing and urged donors to instead send cash,
food and building supplies.
   Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn, returned from a
helicopter tour of the coast Monday sobered by the extent of the
destruction.
   ``It's really incredible. There are areas that look like war
zones,'' said Mrs. Quayle, who helped out Monday taking
applications at a Federal Emergency Management Agency center in
Moncks Corner.
   ``I think people understand that this has been devastating. I
think we can see that in the nationwide outpouring of volunteers
that the whole country understands.''
   Hurricane Hugo slammed into South Carolina Sept. 21 with 135 mph
winds, leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless, 270,000 jobless,
and homes, businesses, schools and municipal buildings damaged or
destroyed far inland and in North Carolina. In all, Hugo killed 29
people on the U.S. mainland.
   The warning against swimming could last for months and possibly
affect the spring tourist season, said Wayne Fanning of the
Department of Health and Environmental Control.
   The indefinite ban on shellfishing was enacted because the 10
major sewage treatment plants in the Charleston area are not
working fully and only 30 percent of the pollutants are being
removed, Fanning said. When released into rivers, the waste
depletes oxygen in the water, causing widespread fish kills.
   Rain that has hurt recovery efforts continued in some parts of
the South.
   In Monroe, N.C., a community that was in Hugo's path, a man and
woman were killed Monday when their car was washed into a flooded
creek. A search resumed today for a 17-year-old girl who was riding
in the car.
   The nation's generosity toward storm victims has brought a
backlog of donated clothing, including boxcar loads from the West
Coast, said Maj. Ken Bush of the Salvation Army.
   In the hard-hit fishing village of McClellanville about 30 miles
northeast of Charleston, the school is filled with donated clothes,
said Billy Newsome of the American Red Cross.
   ``Used clothing has almost choked us to death,'' he said, adding
what's needed is donations of non-perishable food and building
supplies.
   The Army Corps of Engineers prepared to repair the Ben Sawyer
Bridge _ the only link between the mainland and the devastated
resorts of Sullivan's Island and the Isle of Palms. The storm left
the swing bridge hanging at a 45-degree angle with one end
submerged in the water.
   Workers were to float barges under the dangling section and use
the rising tide late today to help raise the bridge, said corps
spokesman Rod Ruffennach. Then cranes will swing the bridge back
into position.
   The bridge will be left in position for cars to traverse until
experts determine whether they can repair the swing mechanism that
opens the bridge to allow boats to pass on the Intracoastal
Waterway.
   The Corps also announced that two contractors will pour sand on
eight miles of beaches from North Myrtle Beach to Pawleys Island
later this week.
   The sand is meant to block further erosion of hurricane-damaged
property during a surge of high tides expected in mid-October.
   Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said 60 trucks carrying
canned food, clothing and other necessities rolled into the city
Monday.
   The mayor also said the city's dawn-to-dusk curfew, in effect
since the storm, has been shortened to 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., but was
still being enforced by the National Guard.
   Riley said about 90 percent of the city's hotels have reopened
and many restaurants are back in business.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., took to the Senate floor Monday
and continued his criticism of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which is coordinating the federal government's response to
the disaster.
   ``FEMA does not have but 10 centers in South Carolina 10 days
after the disaster,'' he said. ``And, as far as I know, they still
haven't given out a financial grant yet.''
   Damage in South Carolina alone has been estimated at $3 billion
or more, with crop damage placed at $100 million.

   Gay men and intravenous drug users have been
barred from donating sperm in New York state because of worries
about AIDS.
   The regulations, which took effect this week, exclude any man
from donating to a sperm bank if he has had homosexual activity,
intravenous drug use or sex with a ``high risk'' person since 1977.
   The same people already are barred from donating blood in New
York state for the same reason, said Mary Anne Gardineer, Health
Department associate director for regulatory affairs.
   The regulations for the first time also require sperm banks to
obtain state licenses.
   ``Women who choose to undergo artificial insemination should not
be subjected to unnecessary risks for serious and even fatal
illnesses,'' Gardineer said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which chiefly afflicts
homosexual men and intravenous drug users, is spread most often
through sex; needles or syringes shared by drug abusers; infected
blood, and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   Gardineer said there have been cases of infants who contracted
AIDS because of donated sperm, but she could not say how many.
   The prohibition was recommended by several doctors' groups.
   The rules require extensive medical background checks on donors
and tests on the donated sperm. All donations must be frozen for
six months, the time it takes for someone infected with the AIDS
virus to develop antibodies that show up in tests.
   The rules don't apply in cases where a man is donating sperm for
a specific woman, such as his wife, because donors have a right to
privacy, officials said.
   The growing popularity of artificial insemination made the rules
necessary, said Gardineer.
   In 1986, about 60,000 women gave birth as a result of artificial
insemination in the United States. She estimated there are five
sperm banks in New York state, but said the number isn't certain
because they haven't been licensed.
   New York state has 25,000 confirmed AIDS cases, about a quarter
of the nation's total. Most of them are in New York City.

   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
opened an official visit today and joined President Bush in
promising expanded cooperation in combating cross-border drug
smuggling.
   With Bush standing at his side during a White House welcoming
ceremony, Salinas declared that the two countries, working
together, ``can strike lethal blows against drug trafficking to
free the world from that international scourge.''
   In a similar vein, Bush said the United States and Mexico ``must
continue to strengthen our assault on the plague of drug use and
trafficking. For we know that what threatens one nation in our
hemisphere threatens us all.''
   The two presidents then presided over signing of two agreements,
one to promote U.S.-Mexico trade, and the other to provide U.S.
assistance for combating pollution in Mexico City.
   Bush said relations between the two countries have progressed
since Salinas took office last December, citing advances in such
areas as debt, trade, investment and the environment.
   Salinas, speaking through a translator, said ways must be found
to deal more humanely with the migration of Mexicans to the United
States.
   He also said the two countries must work toward a ``new stage''
in their trade relations.
   Salinas is giving high priority to seeking trade concessions
during his visit but a U.S. official, responding Monday to remarks
Salinas made to reporters before leaving Mexico, disagreed with his
contention that Mexico has difficulty penetrating American markets.
   After the welcoming ceremony and a meeting with Bush, Salinas
planned to attend a working lunch with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III. A White House state dinner is scheduled for this evening.
   The Bush administration has been highly complimentary of
Salinas' performance during his first 10 months in office, praising
his economic reform program and his efforts to crack down on
drug-smuggling.
   But trade appears to be one area where the two sides are far
apart.
   Salinas was reported to have complained during his meeting with
reporters that it is inappropriate for the United States to
criticize closed markets in Japan when the United States itself is
guilty of protectionist practices.
   ``I think that reciprocity in commercial relations is
fundamental,'' Salinas was reported to have said. ``Isn't that what
the United States is asking of Japan?''
   A U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, contended the U.S.
market is far more open than Japan's. Whereas the United States has
a huge trade deficit with Japan, Mexico enjoys a $2.7 billion trade
surplus with the United States on total two-way trade of $43.9
billion, the official said.
   The official said that until recently Mexico was one of the most
protectionist countries in the world.
   Salinas has said he expects to press for preferential treatment
for Mexican exports such as textiles, steel and agricultural
products.
   U.S. officials said the administration has made no commitments
to do what Salinas wants, but that he will be given a hearing.
   The officials acknowledged that textiles and steel are highly
sensitive areas for the administration because of protectionist
pressures. As for agricultural products, they said that Mexico
already supplies 60 percent of all the fruits and vegetables
consumed in the United States during the winter months.
   The two sides are expected to sign seven agreements during
Salinas' visit, symbolic of increased U.S.-Mexican cooperation
since Bush and Salinas assumed their respective duties within a few
weeks of each other.
   The agreements cover such issues as trade, investment, the
environment, tourism and law enforcement, according to U.S.
officials.
   Officials from both sides seem relieved that the spirit of
hostility that characterized cross-border relations during the
Reagan administration has largely disappeared.

   Jim Bakker may have begun at PTL as a
``man of good deeds'' but soon became a ``world-class master'' of
half truths to obtain power and wealth, a prosecutor said today at
the evangelist's fraud trial.
   ``What has unfolded before you the last month is a tale of
corruption _ immense corruption,'' prosecutor Deborah Smith said
during closing arguments.
   Bakker scribbled notes on a yellow legal pad and occasionally
glanced at Ms. Smith.
   ``There may have been a time when Mr. Bakker was a man of good
deeds back in the 1970s, but as time progressed into the 1980s, he
began to use people to obtain possessions and power and keep it,''
she said.
   Bakker's lawyer was to deliver his closing argument later in the
day. Jury deliberations in the federal court trial were expected to
begin as early as Wednesday.
   Ms. Smith described Bakker as a ``world-class master of using
half truths. He lied to people, he used half truths to manipulate
people. He used his position to maintain his power and wealth.''
   Bakker completed his testimony Monday by accusing the Rev. Jerry
Falwell of cheating PTL followers and by conceding he and his wife
accepted millions in bonuses as the ministry's finances foundered.
   ``The real conspiracy to defraud came from that group of people
who took over the ministry for their own selfish gains,'' said
Bakker, who invited Falwell to take over the ministry when he
resigned in 1987 in a sex and money scandal.
   Bakker also denied the prosecutor's assertion that he failed to
tell PTL board members about the ministry's money problems.
   ``I don't know how the board members could not be aware of the
financial crisis at Heritage USA,'' he testified. ``They knew we
had cash flow problems and they voted to borrow funds to pay for
them.''
   Bakker, 49, is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.
He is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million in PTL money for
his own benefit.
   If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 120 years
in prison and fined more than $5 million.
   Ms. Smith asked Bakker to explain apparent contradictions
between his story and testimony and exhibits presented by the
government, including former PTL board members who said they didn't
remember voting on some of the large bonuses for Bakker and his
wife.
   Bakker said Falwell and his attorney, Norman Roy Grutman, had
intimidated the directors.
   ``Norman Roy Grutman and Jerry Falwell threatened those board
members that they would be in terrible danger,'' Bakker testified.
Among the threats, Bakker said, was that the directors might be
liable to a civil suit.
   Bakker said he and his wife, Tammy Faye, accepted $3.1 million
in bonuses in the mid-1980s as the ministry's finances ran into
trouble. He said the bonuses amounted to less than 1 percent of the
more than $425 million he raised for the ministry.
   Asked by his lawyer what he did with the $425 million, Bakker
replied, ``I put it to the work of Jesus Christ.''
   Board members granted the bonuses ``of their own free will,''
Bakker said, and often told him he was ``worth much more than this,
and they would say that over and over again.''
   Bakker, who began his testimony Friday, spent 10 hours on the
witness stand. He was the last defense witness.
   Under cross-examination on Friday, Bakker testified repeatedly
that he didn't remember details of his ministry's finances. The
testimony prompted his attorney, George Davis, to say ``it was very
damaging, very devastating.''
   During defense questioning Monday, Bakker summed up his case:
``We were a church, and people always wanted to run it like a
business. I had to keep telling them, this was a church, not a
business.''

   The U.S. Marshals Service today named a Texas
Panhandle man convicted of killing a fellow inmate at the Texas
State Penitentiary to its list of the ``15 Most-Wanted'' fugitives.
   The Marshals Service said Emmett Franklin McSwain is an alleged
major manufacturer and distributor of illegal drugs throughout
Oklahoma, California, Louisiana and Texas.
   McSwain, 50, escaped from the Federal Prison Camp in Texarkana,
Texas, on Jan. 20, 1986, shortly after learning of his indictment
in Oklahoma City as a major illegal drug manufacturer and for
conducting a continuing criminal enterprise, the Marshals Service
said.
   At the time of his escape, he was serving a 10-year sentence for
possession with intent to distribute narcotics, officials said. He
also had been convicted of killing a fellow inmate at the Texas
State Penitentiary in 1970.
   Marshals Service Director Stanley E. Morris said that due to
McSwain should be considered armed and very dangerous.

<HEAD>Tanker Captain Says He Had No Lookout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The captain of a Greek tanker that hit a
reef and spilled 289,000 gallons of heating oil into Narragansett
Bay testified today he did not have the required lookout on the
bridge when entering the harbor.
   Iakovos Georgoudis, 43, of Greece also said maps made it unclear
exactly where ships are to pick up their harbor pilots to guide the
vessel into port. The vessel ran aground off Newport on June 23
before a pilot boarded.
   The captain of the World Prodigy told a board of inquiry
convened by the Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety
Board that his company and Greek regulations required a lookout
when entering a harbor.
   ``There was no one,'' however, because the lookout had been sent
to help lower the ladder so the pilot could board, Georgoudis said
through interpreters.
   He said he was doing nearly all the work on the bridge at the
time of the accident, including lookout and navigator. ``I was
everything,'' he said.
   Georgoudis had refused to testify previously before the panel,
citing his right against self-incrimination. That no longer was an
issue after he pleaded guilty in August and September to state and
federal pollution charges.
   The captain was fined a total of $30,500. A charge of failing to
have a pilot on board was dropped as part of the plea bargain.
Authorities said the commonly agreed-on pickup point is actually
inside the area where state law requires a pilot.
   The tanker's owner, Ballard Shipping Co., pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor and was ordered to pay $500,000.
   U.S. Attorney Lincoln Almond has said it was clear that
Georgoudis had too many duties at the time and the accident was
caused by negligence, not by recklessness.
   Gov. Edward DiPrete said $125,000 of Ballard's fine would be
used to help Rhode Island's fishing industry.

   The head of anesthesiology at
Southampton Hospital has been suspended by the hospital after being
accused of paying college students in Oregon to have sex with his
wife.
   Police in Eugene, Ore., alleged that Rodney Wood paid students
to engage in sex with his wife, Nancy, 44, while claiming he was
conducting a study on the sex drive of a mature woman.
   Alex Sneddon, the hospital's director of development, said the
board of directors' three-member executive board, along with
hospital Administrator John Pfister and the president of the
medical staff voted to suspend Wood.
   No formal charges have been filed against Wood or his wife. Sean
Hoar, an assistant district attorney for Lane County, Ore., said a
decision on whether to file formal charges will be made late this
week or early next week.

<HEAD>Students At School Near Power Lines To Be Monitored For Radiation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge says he is going to order
that students at an elementary school wear monitors to test for
possible electromagnetic radiation from nearby high-voltage power
lines.
   Two families who have children in Sandpiper Shores Elementary
School in Boca Raton sued, contending that electromagnetic fields
from a series of power lines within 135 feet of the school may be
harmful to their children's health.
   Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Timothy Poulton said he will
make his ruling after a school board meeting Wednesday.
   Parents and school officials want to have students wear a
one-pound monitor. Six students will take turns wearing the $2,000
device on belts. Such monitors are usually worn by employees of
utility companies.
   Sensors also will be installed in the ground outside the school
and will be carried through the classrooms once a month to measure
electromagnetic fields, created by even the smallest electrical
current.
   The results of research into whether such radiation is harmful
to humans have been contradictory. Some contend it can cause
cancers, depression, miscarriages or other disorders.
   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment issued a
report in June saying more research is needed to explore the
potential health risks from electromagnetic fields produced by
power lines, particularly the effects on the nervous system and
possible role in promoting cancer.
   In November 1985, a Texas jury ordered Houston Lighting &amp; Power
to pay $25.1 million to a suburban school district for building a
high-power transmission line that attorneys claimed threatened the
health of 4,000 students at three schools.
   Poulton ruled this past summer that there was insufficient
evidence of potential harm to close the school as the parents had
asked, but he did close much of the schoolyard during recess.
   In the action Poulton said he will order Wednesday, each
volunteer will wear the monitor for a full school day once a month.
Parents support the plan because the monitor measures a child's
exposure to radiation as the student walks from room to room, as
opposed to a stationary device gauging radiation in a set location.
   Poulton said he will review measurements from the monitor and
the other devices monthly.
   Parents Sharon and Robert Rausch and Steve Tenner sued the
school board last year for locating Sandpiper Shores Elementary
near high-voltage power lines that can carry up to 230,000 volts.
   The Rausches believe electromagnetic fields from power lines
near a school may have contributed to the death from brain-stem
cancer in 1985 of their 8-year-old son William. At the time, they
lived at Warner Robins, Ga.
   Educators want to include five other schools in the radiation
monitoring plan to prove their theory that electric and magnetic
fields at Sandpiper Shores are no different than the radiation
levels that exist on other campuses.
   The plan will cost the school board more than $51,000.
   Florida is among several states with electric field standards
and the first to set a standard for magnetic fields. Strong
opposition is building from Florida homeowners, parents and
environmentalists to proposed 500,000-volt lines in the
west-central and southeastern parts of the state.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher of Britain said she will not visit South Africa until
black leader Nelson Mandela is freed, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The South African daily Business Day also reported that Mrs.
Thatcher reiterated her opposition to imposing sanctions to force
South Africa to end its policy of apartheid, which denies the black
majority a voice in national affairs.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk has called for an end to
discrimination and says he wants to negotiate a new constitution
that would bring blacks into the national government within five
years.
   Mrs. Thatcher said the South African government ``certainly does
not have five years to get negotiations with black leaders going,''
Business Day reported.
   Asked if she planned to visit South Africa, Mrs. Thatcher told
Business Day: ``I will never come unless Mandela has been released
(and has) freedom to speak.''
   Mandela, 71, is the head of the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla movement and is the country's best known black
leader. He has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led
government.
   De Klerk has said the government is seriously considering the
release of Mandela, who is held at a suburban-style house on a
prison farm outside Cape Town.
   Mrs. Thatcher's comments were made during an interview in London
with South African journalists, Business Day said.

   Two energy experts from the United States
and two Egyptians were killed in a collision between their van and
a bus near the Red Sea coast, the U.S. Embassy and Egypt's Middle
East News Agency said Tuesday.
   Two other American energy experts were injured in the crash
Monday night, an embassy spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity.
   The spokeswoman said the crash occurred as the four Americans
and an Egyptian engineer were en route to the Red Sea Port of
Hurghada, 250 miles southeast of Cairo, in a chauffeur-driven van.
   She said she had no details of the collision and could not
provide names of the victims until families were notified.
   The embassy spokeswoman said the dead Americans were employees
of Burns and Roe, a consulting firm based in Ordell, N.J. She said
the injured Americans work for another consulting firm, R. Lynette
and Associates, of Redmond, Wash.
   She said the firms were under contract to the U.S. Agency for
International Development and were working on an energy project for
Egypt's Ministry of Electricity in the Hurghada area.
   The Egyptian news agency said Mohammed Metwalli Sayed, an
Egyptian engineer accompanying the Americans, and Sayed Mahmoud,
the van's driver, died in the collision.
   The bodies of the dead Americans were flown to Cairo on Tuesday,
the news agency said. The embassy spokeswoman said they will be
sent home for burial.

   Nine infants were hospitalized for severe
intoxication in Tel Aviv after mothers mistakenly gave them an
alcohol-based antiseptic instead of stomach medicine sold in
similar bottles, health officials said Tuesday.
   All the infants were about a month old and were being treated in
Tel Aviv's Sheba Hospital. Two were in the intensive care unit,
newspaper reports said.
   The Health Ministry issued a warning to mothers on Monday after
learning of the mix-up but said it will not order changes in the
packaging or labels on the bottles.
   Babic, a medicine commonly used to treat gas pains in infants,
is packaged in white plastic bottles that look like those
containing an alcohol-based antiseptic used externally.
   ``We warned mothers to pay attention to the labels,'' said
Health Ministry spokesman Gabi Zohar.
   Although the two products have different labels, the mothers
apparently confused the bottles while trying to give medicine at
night, the Yediot Ahronot daily said. It said a mother who realized
her mistake brought both bottles to the hospital.
   Zohar said it was unclear why the problem arose in the same area
of Tel Aviv at the same time, but the Jerusalem Post reported
similar problems earlier with the two products.
   The alcohol caused breathing difficulties, lowered the infants'
blood sugar and made them sluggish and sleepy.

   Two Dutch men were sentenced to
five-year prison terms Tuesday for stealing three paintings by
Vincent van Gogh and demanding a $2.2 million ransom for them, a
court spokeswoman said.
   No ransom was paid for the works, and they were all recovered
undamaged.
   The three paintings, which have a combined value of $72 million
to $90 million, were stolen Dec. 12, 1988 from the Kroeller Mueller
Museum, which is in a remote national park 12 miles north of this
eastern Dutch city.
   The thieves smashed a window of the museum and got away with the
paintings before police arrived.
   In April, the thieves returned one of the works, ``The Loom''
from 1884, in an attempt to enforce their ransom demand.
   However, a planned ransom exchange fell through, and the two
other paintings, the 1887 ``Wilted Sunflowers'' and an early
version of the famous ``Potato Eaters'' painted in 1885, were
recovered following the July arrests of four suspects.
   The two other men arrested are to be tried later this month,
said court spokeswoman Lidwina van Zanten. They were not identified
in accordance with Dutch judicial practice.

<HEAD>EDs: Tops with 16 grafs of detail on Kemp proposal to reform HUD;

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary Jack Kemp today is unveiling a
package of proposals aimed at reforming the scandal-plagued
Department of Housing and Urban Development, including naming a
chief financial officer and requiring public registration of
lobbyists and consultants, sources familiar with the proposal said
today.
   Kemp's proposal also calls for the elimination of HUD grant
funds that are awarded at the discretion of the secretary, and
would impose new restrictions on Federal Housing
Administration-backed mortgages for investment and vacation
property, sources said.
   The elimination of HUD's discretionary grants, including on the
$3 billion community development block grant program, would mean
the awards would be based on competition.
   Kemp planned to announce his reform package at an afternoon news
conference.
   Portions of his plans already have been discussed by HUD
officials, including his intention to create a new top-level,
independent position of chief financial officer reporting to the
secretary. Kemp's appointee as assistant secretary for
administration, Claire Freeman, told Congress last month that plans
were being made for financial officer with broad powers _ a
position that does not exist now in the scandal-plagued department.
   HUD has been hit by scandals over alleged mismanagement, fraud,
influence peddling, and the steering of lucrative HUD subsidies to
politically favored developers, consultants and lobbyists.
Estimates of the cost range into the billions of dollars.
   Included in Kemp's package, the sources said, are a requirement
that consultants and lobbyists who deal with the agency register
and publicly disclose their dealings.
   A congressional source familiar with the Kemp reforms said Kemp
also will propose that HUD kill its Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation Program, the multimillion dollar rent-subsidy
program found to be riddled with influence peddling.
   It was an April audit of that program that set off the current
investigations of HUD. The auditors found that subsidies appeared
to have been steered to former agency officials and developers who
hired prominent GOP consultants to lobby HUD.
   Also in the package, a source said, is a proposal providing that
1.5 percent of money in each HUD program would be allocated to
evaluation of how that program is working _ a move aimed at making
sure HUD officials are aware of program abuses.
   Other features would require public dislosure by HUD when it is
waiving any regulations, and restrictions on the obtaining of
double subsidies by some developers, such as renovation subsidies
and tax credits.
   On FHA, the sources said, the secretary was proposing a
prohibition on FHA-backed loans for investment property and second
homes used as vacatation homes. It will impose tougher capital
requirements for companies who underwrite a portion of FHA loans
under the multi-family coinsurance program, the sources said.
   Dealings by politically connected lobbyists and consultants was
the subject of a hearing Monday by a House committee that has been
investigating the HUD scandals.
   The chairman, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., charged that a
``greased, sweetheart deal'' brought $31 million in federal housing
subsidies to a New Jersey renovation project, but the apartments
are still like slums.
   Lantos said ``infinitely more worthy projects'' were denied
funds when HUD made the grant to the housing project in which
Republican lobbyist Paul Manafort is a partner.
   But Manafort testified at a hearing Monday that his lobbying
company ``has worked within the existing system at HUD'' and
``played by the rules.''
   Lantos said his subcommittee's staff last week visited
Manafort's 326-unit Seabrook project in Upper Deerfield, N.J., a
1940s complex that Manafort's partnership is renovating with the
HUD subsidies.
   Lantos said his staff found apartments renting for more than
$700 a month, including federal subsidies, but lacking gutters and
refrigerators. Some had suffered water damage, he said.
   ``What they saw and heard was shocking, particularly for a
project that is costing taxpayers $31,163,400 in rent subsidies
alone, plus additional millions in tax credits,'' he said.
   Referring to the game of ``Monopoly,'' Lantos said: ``For well
over $31 million, I would have expected at least Marvin Gardens.
Unfortunately we have here only a slum on Baltic or Mediterranean
Avenue.''
   Manafort, a former campaign adviser to President Bush and former
President Reagan and a former business partner of Republican
National Chairman Lee Atwater, underwent contentious questioning
from the House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and
housing.
   Manafort said that while 182 units are occupied, construction is
still under way and asserted, ``When we are finished with
construction, we believe the tenants will be happy.''
   When he appeared before the panel in June, Manafort acknowledged
that his work amounted to ``influence-peddling.'' However, on
Monday he denied receiving an advance tip by HUD insiders on the
availability of subsidies for renovating low-income housing
projects, which were prized profit-makers for developers.
   He said he had little contact with Deborah Gore Dean, the former
executive assistant to former HUD Secretary Sam Pierce who is a
focus of the panel's probe into alleged political
influence-peddling at HUD. Dean, Pierce and two other former HUD
officials have refused to testify on constitutional grounds.
   But two associates in Manafort's lobbying company acknowledged
further contacts with Dean. Laurence Gay testified he met with Dean
and discussed the New Jersey project. Another associate, Richard
Davis, was a former White House liaison to HUD who said he had been
in contact with Dean daily while in government.
   Manafort contended that partners in the development faced normal
business risks, including the potential loss of a $450,000 down
payment, in buying the dilapidated housing and putting together a
package of subsidies and financing.
   Lantos, however, contended Manafort had enjoyed an inside line
to top HUD officials and was able to bypass procedures at HUD's
regional office.
   ``This was a greased, sweetheart deal, where all the
participants knew what the final outcome would be,'' Lantos said.
``Deborah Dean promised them the units (of subsidy) and she
delivered on the units. Those are the facts.''

   More than 182,000 AIDS cases were reported
worldwide by the end of September, a month in which nearly 5,000
new victims were registered, a World Health Organization update
said Tuesday.
   The United States reported most of the new cases _ 3,325 _
raising its total to 104,210. The U.S. figure accounted for 57
percent of the 182,463 cases reported in 152 countries through last
month.
   WHO experts estimate the actual global total is more than double
that and that at least 1 million new cases will occur worldwide by
1993.
   Updates from several West European countries also pushed up the
total toll. WHO covers only people diagnosed as having developed
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, not those infected by the AIDS
virus who have not developed the disease itself.
   Brazil reported 7,538 cases, giving it the world's
second-highest reported total. Uganda, which has not updated its
figure since April, has reported 7,375 victims, followed by France
with 7,149.
   Brazil's rate of 2.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants is lower than
Uganda's rate of 26.3 per 100,000 and France's rate of 4.5 per
100,000. The United States has a rate of 11.7 AIDS cases per
100,000.
   Switzerland, with 921 reported cases, remains proportionally the
hardest-hit European country, with 5.1 cases for every 100,000
people.

<HEAD>Anne Pollard Makes Appeals for Help to Israeli Prime Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anne Pollard, whose husband was convicted of
spying for Israel and is serving a life sentence in a U.S. prison,
has asked Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to intervene with President
Bush on the American couple's behalf.
   Mrs. Pollard, also serving time in prison, said in a radio
broadcast Monday night: ``Johnathan and I are appealing to Shamir
to put an end to the Pollard affair once and for all.''
   A spokesman for Shamir's office said he was working to have them
freed ``on humanitarian grounds.''
   Jonathan Pollard, a former civilian intelligence analyst for the
U.S. Navy, was given a life term in 1987 for supplying classified
documents to Israeli agents.
   His wife spoke Monday night from a New York City apartment
during a furlough from a federal prison in Danbury, Conn., where
she is serving five years on related charges. She is to return to
the prison next week.
   Anne Pollard's father rented the apartment for her. She is said
to have a rare stomach disorder that has caused her to lose
considerable weight.
   She said the case could be resolved ``if the prime minister
would, either privately or openly _ and most importantly, candidly
_ discuss our case directly with President Bush. We strongly
believe this would be in the best interests of the United States
and Israel.''
   ``First and foremost, on behalf of my beloved husband Jonathan
and I, we wish to thank each and every citizen of the state of
Israel for their tremendous support of us throughout our plight,
and we are eternally grateful,'' she said.
   The Pollards have received support from some Jewish groups in
Israel and the United States that advocate Israeli government
intervention in the case.
   Mrs. Pollard spoke in English and an announcer translated her
remarks into Hebrew.
   The Israeli government has said it did not know of Pollard's
spying.

<HEAD>Gay Clergyman Sues Norwegian Church Over Job Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A clergyman Tuesday sued the state Lutheran
Church Council for denying him a job because he is a homosexual.
   Former hospital chaplain Jens T. Olsen, 41, was refused a job
with the council in March. Council spokesman Gunnar Vestermoen said
Olsen was not hired because he had lived with his homosexual
partner of seven years, in violation of church teachings.
   ``He was the first choice and was obviously well-qualified ...
but the council dropped him because he lived in a homosexual
relationship,'' said Vestermoen.
   The case went to court two days after a law took effect in
neighboring Denmark allowing homosexual couples to be registered as
``partners'' by civil authorities, with all the rights of married
heterosexual couples except adopting children. Eleven male couples
were ``married'' there Sunday.
   About 130 church workers, including clergymen, have supported
Olsen through petitions and newspaper advertisements.
   ``Support is warming up ... I am not alone within the church in
my views. The church discriminates against homosexuals,'' Oslen
told the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet.
   Supporters have cited a 1977 church decision to stop condemning
latent homosexuality to argue Olsen's case.
   ``It is meaningless ... to treat feelings and practice
differently,'' said theology professor Jacob Jervell. ``The council
accepts homosexuals but says it is wrong for them to live
together,'' he told Dagbladet.

<TEXT>
   The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation
announced Thursday it is spending nearly $700,000 on model programs
to encourage people in 10 states - including Nebraska farmers,
Harlem blacks and tourists in Las Vegas casinos - to eat less fat.
   ``We are taking this campaign to the heartland of America,''
Alvin Tarlov, president of the foundation, said in announcing the
two-year grants under the foundation's Project LEAN, an acronym for
Low-fat Eating for America Now.
   He said the programs will be monitored for their effectiveness
by teams from the Centers for Disease Control and Stanford
University and vary widely from state to state.
   ``Thus, in New York, the Project LEAN program will focus on
reaching blacks and Hispanics in four communities - Washington
Heights, Harlem, East Harlem, and Bedford-Stuyvesant,'' he said.
``Baltimore will be targeting the 60 percent of the city's
population that is non-white by aiming at 24 contiguous
neighborhoods in West Baltimore.''
   Dr. J. Michael McGinnis, deputy assistant secretary for health,
said minorities, the elderly and low-income people ``have higher
rates of chronic diseases than the general population, and they can
also be the most difficult to reach with the information and
support that can foster beneficial change in health behaviors.''
   ``Nebraska will be trying to reduce fat consumption in one of
the key farm states,'' Tarlov said. ``And Las Vegas will be
targeting the millions of tourists eating out during their
vacations and conventions.''
   Gary Edwards, director of lifestyle assessment for the Utah
Department of Health, said project workers in Utah would help
supermarkets mark shelves to identify low-fat foods. He said the
program also would include grocery tours for students.
   Robert Mancke, director of the Maryland Bureau of Health
Education, said the bureau had commitments from two supermarkets,
one minority-owned and one with many non-white customers, to label
and promote low-fat products. In addition, a Baltimore organization
called Creative Community would present skits and other
performances on the theme of more healthy eating.
   The grants are:
   _ To the Maricopa County Department of Health, Phoenix, Ariz.,
$60,000 to expand a program of dietician-led tours in supermarkets,
shopping guides and recipes.
   _ To the California Public Health Foundation, Berkeley, Calif.,
$70,000 in support of a coalition including the Bay Area Cancer
Coalition, the California Beef Council, a supermarket chain and the
University of California.
   _ To the Baltimore Health Department, $70,000 to reduce fats in
the diets of inner-city residents in collaboration with the State
Health Department and Baltimore City Alliance for High Blood
Pressure.
   _ To the New York City Department of Health, $70,000 for a
program aimed at reducing fat consumption among blacks and
Hispanics, using Project Lean materials and other resources.
   _ To the Nebraska Department of Health $70,000 for programs in
supermarkets, work sites and schools and a media campaign.
   _ To the University of Nevada Cooperative Extension, Las Vegas,
$70,000 for a program targeting the casino and restaurant
industries in an effort to reduce fat consumption of tourists and
others eating away from home.
   _ To the Rhode Island Department of Health $60,000 for a
supermarket and media campaign.
   _ To the Utah Department of Health, $70,000 for a program aimed
at public school curricula, school lunch programs and retail
supermarkets in Davis and Wasatch counties.
   _ To the Virginia Department of Health for a statewide
information campaign and targeted efforts in the Hampton, Roanoke
and Thomas Jefferson health districts.
   _ To the West Virginia Department of Health for coordination of
statewide and community campaigns through the media, food outlets,
professional health organizations and public events.

<TEXT>
   The secret to eternal life may be retirement
abroad _ at least for people who receive U.S. government benefits.
   Judging from available records, such people never die; they just
keep collecting their checks, the inspector general of the
Department of Health and Human Services told Congress on Tuesday.
   ``Those program benefits go on forever and ever,'' Inspector
General Richard Kusserow told the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee.
   Kusserow said the government doesn't know how widespread the
problem is, or how costly, or where it is greatest, because HHS
depends on local governments and the State Department to validate
deaths and tell Washington when to stop checks.
   ``In rural Mexico or the Philippines ... a local constabulary is
going to stop a benefit from going into a village? No,'' he told
the panel.
   Kusserow said he's also suspicious of the long lifespans of
people who retire to Poland, where the benefits are distributed
through the government. But there's no evidence of wrongdoing, he
said.
   The panel's chairman, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, suggested proof
could be found ``when you have people who are obviously 120 years
old'' collecting benefits.
   The department's independent auditor said he liked a suggestion
by Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, to impose regular check-in
requirements on people collecting benefits abroad.
   ``I think it's a good idea that periodically they should produce
evidence that they are alive and well,'' Kusserow said. ``Pretty
soon we'll find people living throughout the world and not just
Transylvania will never die.''

<TEXT>
   No common-law marriage exists between William
Hurt and Sandra Jennings, a judge ruled today, precluding Hurt's
former live-in lover from claiming nearly half ``The Big Chill''
star's movie millions.
   State Supreme Court Justice Jacqueline Silbermann said that the
relationship was illicit when it began because Hurt was married to
someone else, and that it did not become legitimate simply because
the actor got divorced.
   ``Absent proof of a mutual agreement to be married, an agreement
to marry cannot be inferred from the fact that the parties were
living together,'' the judge said. ``The contrary is true.''
   If the judge had determined the two were married under common
law, Ms. Jennings could have pursued up to half Hurt's earnings.
The decision did not deal with support for the couple's 6-year-old
son, Alexander Devon Hurt.
   Jennings' lawyer, A. Richard Golub, called the ruling a ``joke''
and said he would appeal. The judge is ``so madly in love with this
defendant, Bill Hurt, that we never could have gotten a fair
shake,'' he said.
   ``If we had won, I would have been shocked,'' Golub said.
   Jennings, a former dancer, sued Hurt for equitable distribution
of his assets, estimated by Golub at $5 million to $7 million,
after Hurt refused to increase financial support to her and their
son. Under an agreement between Hurt and Jennings, he was paying
them $60,000 to $65,000 a year.
   Jennings, 32, based her suit on four of the 10 weeks she spent
with Hurt in Beaufort, S.C., during the winter of 1982-83 while he
was there filming ``The Big Chill.'' The movie was about a reunion
of 1960s-era college chums.
   Common-law marriages were abolished in 1933 in New York state,
where Jennings and Hurt also lived, but South Carolina recognizes
such unions.
   Jennings contended that during the four weeks between Dec. 9,
when Hurt learned actress Mary Beth Hurt had divorced him, and Jan.
10, when Jennings and Hurt left the state, a common-law marriage
existed between them.
   Hurt's publicist, Lois Smith, was at the courthouse waiting with
reporters when copies of the decision were handed out, and she
distributed a statement from the actor, who has starred in such
films as ``Body Heat,'' ``Children of a Lesser God,'' ``Kiss of the
Spider Woman'' and ``The Accidental Tourist.''
   ``I am thankful for the ruling received today, which is a
vindication of everything I have said and that has been said by
those who have supported me,'' the statement said.
   Hurt was ``perplexed'' when Jennings brought the suit, Smith
said. Prior to trial, Hurt had suggested Jennings was trying to
simply shake him down for more support.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to
consider a request that it nullify President Corazon Aquino's
decision not to let her predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos, be buried in
the Philippines.
   Imelda Marcos, the former president's widow, pledged to return
to the United States for trial on charges of embezzling Philippine
government funds if she was permitted to bury her husband, who died
Thursday in Honolulu at age 72, in the Philippines.
   Marcos ruled the archipelago for 20 years until a
civilian-military uprising drove him into exile in Hawaii in
February 1986.
   Several coups have been attempted by Marcos supporters. Mrs.
Aquino says the return of the body or of members of the family
could cause unrest.
   Philippine officials charge that Marcos, his family and
associates looted the country of up to $10 billion during his time
in power.
   Sen. Leticia Ramos-Shahani, who is related to Marcos but
supports Mrs. Aquino, urged Tuesday that the government begin
negotiations with the Marcos family toward allowing the former
president to be buried in the Philippines ``at the appropriate
time.''
   Mrs. Ramos-Shahani said Marcos should be buried in his home
province, Ilocos Norte, with the family allowed to attend the
funeral.
   ``The two parties should be given time to find a mutually
acceptable agreement,'' said the senator, who is the sister of
Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos amd head of the Senate committee on
foreign relations.
   Asked by The Associated Press how soon the body should be
returned, she said: ``One or two months.''
   Former Sen. Arturo Tolentino, Marcos' running mate in 1986, said
Monday the body could be flown directly to the international
airport at Laoag, capital of Ilocos Norte, instead of passing
through Manila. Laoag is about 250 miles north of the capital.
   Also Monday, Marcos supporters petitioned the Supreme Court to
overturn Mrs. Aquino's ban and allow Imelda Marcos and her three
children to bring the body to the Philippines. The court agreed
Tuesday to consider the petition, and Justice Teodoro Padilla said
the government was given 10 days to respond.
   Solicitor-General Francisco Chavez said the government would
argue that the issue is political, not legal, and that Mrs. Marcos
might use the opportunity to evade prosecution in the United States.
   Imelda Marcos has been prohibited from leaving the United
States, where she is to be tried in New York in March on charges of
embezzling Philippine government money and investing some of it in
the United States. The Marcoses were indicted in October and Mrs.
Marcos is free on $5 million bond.
   ``I will have to go back to New York because I have to face the
indictment,'' Mrs. Marcos told the Manila radio station DZXL in an
interview from Honolulu on Tuesday. ``What I am defending here is
not only the Marcos name, but the entire nation.''
   The government anti-graft court temporarily suspended
proceedings Tuesday in the first of 35 civil suits against Marcos.
Government lawyers said they would file a petition soon to
substitute either the Marcos estate or the late president's
executor as a defendant.
   In the appeal to the Supreme Court, Marcos supporters claimed
Mrs. Aquino's refusal to permit burial in the Philippines violates
the constitution. On Sept. 15, before Marcos died, the court ruled
8-7 that his return would be a threat to security.

<HEAD>Abortion Restrictions Proposed in Pennsylvania</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the Legislature's
anti-abortion forces today introduced a bill to put sweeping
restrictions on abortion.
   At a news conference, Republican Rep. Stephen Freind said the
legislation would directly challenge Roe vs. Wade and give the U.S.
Supreme Court another chance to overturn its 1973 ruling
establishing the right to an abortion.
   Earlier this year, the high court gave states broader powers to
restrict abortions. Freind's bill, which has the backing of
Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey, could be the first to be adopted
since that ruling in July.
   The suburban Philadelphia legislator, who arrived at the news
conference under police guard and was picketed by abortion-rights
advocates, said his bill would:
   _ Require a 24-hour waiting period before a woman can have an
abortion.
   _ Outlaw all abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except
to save the woman's life.
   _ Ban abortions by women who want to choose the sex of a child.
   _ Require notification of the spouse before a woman has an
abortion. The high court has previously rejected such notification
laws.
   ``We are very encouraged that the legislation will be passed by
the Pennsylvania Legislature,'' said Mary Beliveau of the
Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation.
   Abortion-rights advocates today introduced their legislative
package, including a proposed constitutional amendment establishing
a right to an abortion.
   The pro-choice bills would also restore government funding for
poor women who have medically necessary abortions and would weaken
a law requiring parental notification or a court order before a
minor can obtain an abortion. That provision is not in effect
because it is under court review.
   While Pennsylvania's Legislature historically has opposed
abortion, pro-choice advocates said today that most Pennsylvania
voters support the right to choose.
   In a poll of 500 likely voters, the National Abortion Rights
Action League said 60 percent favored keeping abortion legal, while
33 percent wanted to outlaw it.
   ``This data shows how dramatically out-of-step Pennsylvania's
officials are with their constituents on abortion,'' said Kate
Michelman, the league's executive director. ``The political
atmosphere surrounding choice is more highly charged than ever. ...
Politicians in Pennsylvania who support abortion restrictions in
1989 may well be voted out of office in 1990.''
   The poll, taken Sept. 25-28 by Hickman-Maslin Research Inc., has
a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 points.

   The Soviet legislature today imposed a selective
ban on strikes in key economic areas in a compromise with President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal for a complete ban.
   Gorbachev said he was satisfied with the compromise, and that it
would ``help restore a normal life.''
   ``This is a decision in support of perestroika,'' he said.
   A day after hearing Gorbachev's proposal to ban all strikes for
the next 15 months, a joint session of the Supreme Soviet's two
chambers spent all of today in confused debate before arriving at a
weakened version.
   In the end, it approved by a vote of 364-6 a temporary ban on
strikes in the industries of transport, energy, metallurgy and all
raw materials until it can approve full legislation governing
strikes.
   A detailed law regulating strikes may be ready as soon as next
week.
   A draft law bans strikes that could threaten the lives or health
of people, and also in transportation, communications, energy,
defense industries and government organs. However, many of the key
issues in the draft have not yet been approved.
   Gorbachev repeated his warning that the Soviet economy is
threatened by waves of politically motivated job actions, but did
not call again for an outright ban on all strikes.
   Deputies included in their decision language that would allow
the country's ministries of interior, defense and transport to take
over railroads in Armenia and Azerbaijan if necessary to get rail
traffic moving again to Armenia.
   Earlier, during a break in the debate, Interior Ministery Vadim
Bakatin called the proposed strike ban unconstitutional.
   ``We don't have a basis for deciding what is an extraordinary
situation,'' he said.
   Leonid Abalkin, a deputy premier in charge of economic reform,
said the initiative to change the draft resolution came during an
overnight meeting of deputies and not from Gorbachev.
   ``Everyone wants to be sympathethic, wants the public to like
them, and nobody wants to take the responsibility,'' he said.
   Marju Lauristin, a deputy and leader of the Estonian Popular
Front, said she favored a limit on strikes called for political
reasons, which she said could be used as an excuse for military
intervention.
   Gorbachev, in calling for a ban on strikes, called the measure
necessary ``to protect democratization from anarchy and
irresponsible management.''
   By inserting the threat to take over operations and security on
the country's railroads, the legislators were acting to bring an
end to a blockade by Azerbaijanis of rail lines leading from their
republic into Armenia.
   Soviet law does not ban strikes outright. But labor unrest was
ruthlessly repressed before Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and
began his effort to turn the Soviet Union into a country ruled by
law instead of dictate.
   Gorbachev said Monday that his proposal to ban strikes was ``not
an effort to stop the processes that are underway in the framework
of perestroika.''
   A key element of Gorbachev's reforms is perestroika, or
restructuring the Soviet's Union's stumbling and shortage-ridden
economy, and the Soviet leader said that economic transformation is
``under threat'' because of strikes.
   First Deputy Premier Lev Voronin told lawmakers Monday that the
economy lost $6.15 billion in July and August because of strikes
and supplies of fuel are so low the country might be unable to
provide enough heat for citizens through the winter.
   A letter dated Sept. 29 and read out to the Supreme Soviet from
the Trade Union of Electrical Workers suggested that extreme action
was needed to restore the ``rhythym of labor'' in the country.
   The most damaging strike this year was a walkout in July by
thousands of coal miners in the far north, Siberia, and the Don
Basin of the eastern Ukraine. That strike cost the country millions
of rubles and the government agreed to a package of economic and
social improvements that officials said will cost about $3 billion.
   Strikes also have become a way of expressing ethnic discontent.
   They have afflicted Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed predominantly
Armenian enclave in the southern republic of Azerbaijan. And
Russian workers in Moldavia and Estonia have struck to protest
local laws they say favor the majority Estonians and Moldavians.
   The package of laws under discussion includes the proposed
creation of a ``special form of administration'' for railroads in
the Caucasus republics, where Azerbaijanis reportedly blocked
shipments of goods to Armenia.
   Another proposal put forth at today's session was a price freeze
on all food and manufactured goods.
   The measure was proposed by the Committee of People's Control, a
part of the Supreme Soviet Committee on Labor, Prices and Social
policy.

He died Saturday.
   Zsa Zsa Gabor said De Szigethy married her mother, now 91, in

Freedom Fighter who resisted the communist takeover of Hungary in
1954.
   He was Jolie Gabor's third husband, and Miss Gabor said the
relationship was ``one of the great love affairs of all time.'' The
couple had known each other in Budapest but did not become
romantically involved until meeting again in this country, she said.
   De Szigethy operated his wife's jewelry store in New York City.
   Zsa Zsa Gabor made several visits to the desert to comfort her
mother and ailing stepfather during the actress' celebrated

   Alpay Durduran, an independent deputy in the unicameral
Parliament of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, lives in one
of the apartments where windows were shattered.
   He told reporters he did not believe there was a political
motive behind the explosion.
   Durduran said his statements against smugglers of drugs, arms
and antiquities on the island made him a target.
   Turkish Cypriot police were investigating the incident.
   Also Tuesday, officials from the main opposition leftist
Republican Turkish Party found a bomb in front of the party
offices, said party leader Ozker Ozgur.
   It was deactivated before it exploded.
   Cyprus has been divided into northern Turkish and southern Greek
Cypriot sectors since Turkish troops invaded the island following
an Athens-backed coup in 1974.

   The pilot of a United Airlines jet reported a

returned the plane safely to O'Hare International Airport,
authorities said.
   No fire was found and no injuries were reported among the 77
passengers and six crew members aboard the Boeing 727, officials
said.
   The flight originated in Nashville, Tenn., and was headed for
Salt Lake City when it left O'Hare, said United spokeswoman Sara

   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mort Edelstein said
witnesses on the ground reported flames coming out an engine. But
Ms. Dornacker said there were no flames and that a ruptured heating

<HEAD>Government Cuts Salaries of President, Top Officials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The government cut in half the
salary of Haiti's leader, and top officials' salaries were slashed
up to 33 percent in an effort to reduce the budget deficit, an
official newspaper said Tuesday.
   An Information Ministry communique published in L'Union, the
government's daily newspaper, said Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril's $10,000
a month salary has been reduced to $5,000. It said a 33 percent
salary cut would apply to Cabinet ministers, who earned $3,500
before the cut.
   The salary cuts, effective for six months starting Oct. 1, ``are
part of a strategy which aims at lessening the ills of the present
economic crisis,'' the communique said.
   A 20 percent salary cut was applied to top civil servants
earning $1,500 monthly, and 10 percent was deducted from the
salaries of public workers earning $1,000 monthly.
   The average annual income in Haiti is less than $300 a year.
   Haiti, one of the world's poorest nations, has a deficit of $60
million. The foreign debt is $800 million, three times more than
the annual budget. Government salaries account for 75 percent of
the budget, L'Union said.
   The move came a week after a 24-hour strike shut down virtually
all businesses and transport in the Caribbean nation of 6 million.
The strike was called by leftist and conservative groups to protest
austerity measures imposed to win a $26.5 million loan from the
International Monetary Fund.
   The day after the strike, Avril conceded the strikers' demands
were just but said he had no choice but to negotiate with the IMF
because ``we had a knife to our throat.''

<HEAD>Court Ruling Upends Age-Bias Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 4,000 Westinghouse Electric Corp.
retirees who thought they had won $35 million in an age
discrimination suit may have lost it all as a result of a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling, a legal specialist says.
   The high court Monday overturned a lower-court ruling that the
Pittsburgh-based electronics and electric power giant had
discriminated against the retirees by forcing them to choose
between severance pay or early pensions.
   A judge had ruled in the retirees' favor and Westinghouse and
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, representing the
retirees, settled out of court in 1988 for $35 million, or an
average of $8,700 per person.
   But the EEOC backed out of the settlement in hope of a bigger
award in court. In the meantime, Westinghouse pursued the case to
the U.S. Supreme Court _ and won.
   ``It means they blew it. They got greedy, in my opinion,'' said
Dick Lauver, a Pittsburgh pension lawyer not involved in the case.
``They chose to forgo a very favorable settlement to get a
favorable court decision.''
   However, Donald Livingston, special assistant to the EEOC
general counsel in Washington, said the case ``is far from over.''
   ``There are still a number of areas for the court to decide,''
he said.
   EEOC spokeswoman Deborah Graham said the Westinghouse case was
the commission's biggest age discrimination settlement.
   Westinghouse said it was delighted with Monday's ruling.

<HEAD>Congressional Democrats Announce Aid Program for Poland Hungary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democratic leaders announced
today an aid program for Poland and Hungary that includes $887
million in food and other economic assistance and said they have
invited Solidarity union leader Lech Walesa to address a joint
meeting of Congress next month.
   Denouncing Bush administration aid efforts to date as ``grossly
inadequate,'' the Democrats proposed a package that also includes a
five-year moratorium on Poland's $2.5 billion debt to U.S. banks
and $1.4 billion in loans from international lending institutions.
   The package would include the authorization of $887 million in
U.S. food and economic aid over the next three years.
   This contrasts with the administation's commitment to date to
provide a total $255 million in assistance to the two East European
nations stuggling to discard communist rule and build democratic
institutions and free markets.
   The announcement came at a news conference held by House Speaker
Thomas F Foley, D-Wash., Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, and about 10 other Democratic figures in both houses.
   Foley and Mitchell said Walesa has been invited to speak before
a joint meeting of Congress on Nov. 15, one of the rare occasions
in U.S . history when such an assembly will have been addressed by
a person who is not a head of state or government.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said the legislation implementing the
aid package will be sped through Congress as quickly as possible in
light of the fact that Poland has nearly exhausted its foreign
currency reserves.
   He said the bill will urge the administration to seek a one-year
standby $700 million loan from the International Monetary Fund and
a $765 million loan from the World Bank.
   The legislation also will urge the White House to direct the
U.S. Treasury to make up to $1 billion available to Poland from
currency stabilization funds, Hamilton said.
   Hamilton said that of the $887 million authorization for U.S.
aid to Poland and Hungary, it is contemplated that Congress will be
asked to appropriate $415 million for the 1990 fiscal year which
opened on Oct. 1.
   The U.S. funds would be obtained by trimming other programs for
which funds have already been appropriated, Hamilton said.
   ``We intend to provide the leadership that has been lacking up
until now,'' Rep. John Dingel, D-Mich., told the news conference.
``The Bush program is grossly inadequate.''
   ``This is a new and meaningful initiative,'' Mitchell said.
``The administration's response to these historic events in Eastern
Europe has been woefully inadequate. In my viuew the
admimnistration has failed completely to understand the historic
nature of what has occurred.''

<TEXT>
   Moscow is supporting Afghanistan's
communist government with the largest military airlift in Soviet
history, Western diplomatic sources said Tuesday.
   They said more than 3,800 supply flights landed in Kabul from
Feb. 15, when the Red Army withdrew after nine years of involvement
in the Afghan civil war, and the beginning of September.
   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, estimated
Soviet military aid to Afghanistan during the first half of 1989
was worth more than $1.5 billion.
   Equipment delivered includes medium-range missiles, tanks and
other armored vehicles, artillery, and MiG-21 and Sukhoi-25 jet
fighters, the sources reported.
   Moslem rebels, supported by neighboring Pakistan and the United
States, regularly raid or have cut most roads linking cities,
making overland supply difficult and dangerous.
   Government forces hold the major cities, but guerrillas control
much of the mountainous countryside after more than 11 years of
civil war.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan said Tuesday her
government was working with Moscow on a political solution to the
Afghan conflict.
   ``We are discussing with the Soviet Union a consensus resolution
on Afghanistan which will be presented at the current session of
the United Nations General Assembly,'' she told reporters in Dhaka
at the end of a three-day visit to Bangladesh. She did not
elaborate.
   Ms. Bhutto said a broad-based representative government was the
only way ``to peace and stability in Afghanistan.''
   She also said a ``conducive condition'' should be created in
Afghanistan for the return of more than 3.5 million Afghans who
have fled to cities and camps inside Pakistan.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting in Afghanistan after a
communist coup in April 1978. The major insurgent groups are based
in Paksitan.
   Diplomats and guerrilla spokesman say battles occur regularly
along the Salang Highway, which connects Kabul with the Soviet
border 210 miles to the north. They said the army had sent
reinforcements to help fight guerrillas who fire at convoys from
the mountains.
   Many trucks that make it to Kabul use a detour built just north
of the city, where guerrillas have controlled a 21-mile stretch of
the Salang since June, the diplomats reported.
   Heavy attacks by insurgents also were reported on convoys bound
for Kandahar in the southeast, Afghanistan's second-largest city.
Diplomats said guerrillas firing rockets and anti-tank weapons
stopped half of a 1,000-unit convoy approaching the city and
destroyed more than 100 vehicles.

   Six explorers crossing Antarctica on skis
and sleds remained trapped Tuesday by a mountain snowstorm but were
out of immediate danger after a support crew airlifted in food and
three fresh dogs.
   Spokeswoman Jennifer Gasperini said from the expedition's St.
Paul headquarters that the hurricane-force winds that had kept the
adventurers in their tents abated over the weekend. However, she
said above-zero temperatures brought 3{ feet of fresh snow, making
it impossible for the dogs to travel.
   Winds of 20 mph Monday night helped pack the surface and left
the snow knee-deep, she said Tuesday. If the relatively light winds
continue, the expedition expects to travel Wednesday toward a food
cache about 15 miles away at Mount Vang.
   High winds, low visibility and deep snow have put the
unprecedented 4,000-mile traverse of Antarctica as much as a week
behind schedule. But the lost time could be made up once the team
leaves the mountainous Antarctic Peninsula and reaches Mount Vang,
the beginning of the flat ice plateau that makes up the continent's
interior, Gasperini said.
   The mushers have traveled 630 miles since July 27.
   On Saturday, a Twin Otter airplane reached the crew on the
trail, bringing needed food and airlifting out 15 exhausted dogs.
The three additional dogs leave the crew with 24 rather than 36
sled dogs, but the six adventurers have lightened their load by
sending out one of their three tents.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany agreed today to let
as many as 11,000 East Germans inside and outside the West German
embassy in Prague travel to the West, a top-ranking official in
Bonn said.
   The first train of East German refugees will depart Prague for
West Germany some time after 8 p.m., said Rudolf Seiters, chief of
staff to Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   It was the second time within a week that East Germany had
reluctantly agreed to allow its citizens to emigrate West. Last
weekend, about 7,000 refugees fled to the West from West German
embassies in Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   The agreement covers 4,700 East Germans inside the embassy and
thousands more who raced to Czechoslovakia in hopes of gaining
passage to the West, but were unable to get into the overfilled
embassy compound, Seiters said.
   Earlier today, about 250 East Germans stormed past police and
into the West German Embassy, and witnesses said some refugees were
injured. East Germany then blocked citizens from traveling to
Czechoslovakia in an effort to stem the flow to the West.
   Until today, East Germans needed neither a visa nor a passport
to travel to Czechoslovakia. The state news agency ADN said that
effective immediately, such documents would be required. That will
effectively block ordinary citizens from going there.
   The ADN dispatch said the move was based on reports indicating
``that certain circles in West Germany are preparing provocations
in conjunction with the celebrations of our 40th anniversary'' on
Saturday.
   ADN did not say anything about changes in travel to Poland,
where East Germans also have holed up in the West German Embassy.
East Germans currently need government permission to travel to
Poland.
   In Bonn, chief government spokesman Hans Klein said East German
leader Erich Honecker earlier had refused to talk to West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl by telephone about the refugee crisis.
   Honecker aides said that preparations for Saturday's 40th
anniversary of the Communist nation precluded an ``appointment for
a telephone call,'' Klein said.
   The anniversary celebration, which is to include a visit by
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, comes amid perhaps East
Germany's most embarrassing diplomatic crisis: the exodus of
thousands of its citizens.
   In another development, the Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda
accused West Germany of interfering in East German affairs by
allowing its embassies in Prague and Warsaw to grant asylum to
refugees.
   ``Political leaders of West Germany have made naked attempts to
interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign East Germany,''
Pravda said.
   Before today's announcment, East Germany had said last weekend's
exodus was a one-time occurrence and demanded that West Germany
expel the thousands of other would-be emigres who subsequently
converged on the missions to follow their countrymen to West
Germany.
   After breaking the police lines at the Prague embassy, the East
Germans scaled a 2-yard-high fence to join the approximately 4,500
refugees already inside embassy grounds.
   The crowd broke into the embassy after West Germany closed the
compound because of intense crowding, and hundreds of East Germans
waited outside, the numbers increasing hourly, witnesses said.
   They said about 500 people reportedly gathered around the
embassy, some even sitting on nearby rooftops.
   Between 200 and 250 East Germans waiting outside the embassy
compound finally stormed through barricades around the embassy
garden fence, climbing into the compound, they said.
   When the refugees battled police who tried to stop them, many
were injured, some from jumping from the fence, the witnesses said.
The number of injured was not immediately known.
   West German Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter Rothen told The
Associated Press in Bonn that the situation in the embassy had
become ``unbearable. It's horribly crowded.''
   After clashes late Monday evening between truncheon-wielding
police and East Germans trying to reach the embassy, police lifted
their controls at the main gate, allowing them to enter but
continuing to patrol the garden fence.
   West German sources said the embassy had been closed at the
request of the German Red Cross, which was concerned about
sanitation problems.
   About 1,000 children were said by refugees to be among those in
the embassy. People were sleeping three to a bed in the tents
scattered across the embassy grounds, refugees said.
   Czechoslovak government spokesman Miroslav Pavel said the
swelling numbers of East Germans ``seriously upsets public order''
in Prague and the government reserved the right to take
``indispensable measures to maintain and restore public order.''
   He said other embassies in the area, including the U.S. Embassy,
had requested increased protection.
   Pavel said in a statement carried by the official CTK news
agency that ``relevant Czechoslovak authorities'' had provided
necessary supplies and ``humanitarian, medical and other technical
assistance.''
   He criticized West Germany as irresponsible for allowing the
refugees to enter the building after allegedly assuring East
Germany and Czechoslovakia that last weekend's situation would not
be repeated.
   In the West German embassy in Warsaw, the number of East Germans
who have arrived in the past two days reached about 300, Rothen
said, but he acknowledged the number could be higher.
   East Berlin restricted travel to Hungary after that country's
liberal leaders opened their border with Austria on Sept. 10 and
thousands of East Germans fled West across it. More than 20,000
have crossed through Hungary since then.
   East Germans unable to reach Hungary then began converging on
the West German embassies in Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   Poland and Hungary are two liberal Warsaw Pact nations growing
increasingly distant from such hard-line allies as Czechoslovakia
and East Germany.
   The East German opposition group New Forum on Monday criticized
the country's Communist leaders for agreeing to the weekend
release, saying in a statement that East Germany is ``losing a
village every day.''
   So far this year more than 120,000 East Germans have reached
West Germany, where they are granted automatic citizenship. The
exodus of the mostly young, skilled workers has hurt East Germany's
economy.
   In Leipzig, East Germany, on Monday, nearly 20,000 people
marched to demand legalization of opposition groups and adoption of
democratic reforms in the country's largest such protest since 1953.
   Witnesses said security officials followed the demonstration but
did not try to break it up.

<HEAD>Kinnock Says Labor `Ready to Negotiate' With New Nuclear Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Neil Kinnock said
Tuesday his Labor Party is ready to ``start being negotiators'' in
government following its renunciation of unilateral nuclear
disarmament.
   ``It is encouraging _ an inspiration _ to see the Labor Party
working together ... exuding to the British people the feeling that
we are fit to serve our country,'' Kinnock said in his keynote
address on the second day of the party's annual conference in this
south England resort.
   Kinnock, confident the weeklong conference will endorse a major
policy overhaul shifting the socialist movement to the center,
added that Britons ``respect us for the changes we have made and
are making.''
   Kinnock, who received a thunderous reception from the 1,500
delegates, has clamped down on Labor's left wing and transformed
the party's poll ratings in the past year.
   The party, consistently ahead in the polls since late spring, is
now in its strongest position since its third successive defeat by
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives in 1987. The next
election must be called by mid-1992.
   The new defense policy, stipulating that a Labor-led government
would give up British nuclear weapons only as part of a negotiated
arms deal, is part of the new policy. It also ditches some other
vote-losers, such as pledges of widespread nationalization.
   ``We seek the power ... to stop being spectators and start being
negotiators,'' said Kinnock during his speech.
   He said that because of deep divisions between East and West,
``security will continue to mean ... the security of negotiated
disarmament.''
   The stance represents a marked personal shift for Kinnock, 47,
who had been an ardent beliver in one-sided nuclear disarmament
since his student days.
   He accused Mrs. Thatcher of isolating Britain internationally,
citing her combative attitude toward the 12-nation European
Economic Community, her pressure for NATO to modernize its
short-range nuclear weapons, and her refusal to impose tough
sanctions against South Africa.
   ``It's not splendid isolation, or cunning, or sagacity, or
statespersonship,'' said Kinnock. ``It's a fundamental failure to
perceive and try to secure Britain's role in a rapidly changing
Europe and a rapidly changing world.''

<TEXT>
   A coalition of New Jersey Teamsters
denounced politicians who make light of former union leader Jimmy
Hoffa's disappearance.
   Delegates to a legislative conference of the 100,000-member
Teamsters Joint Council 73 approved a resolution Monday that calls
for an end to the jokes.
   ``If you don't have any respect for the man, then think at least
about his family. I don't know how they can stand it,'' said
Anthony Rizzo, business manager of Teamsters Local 945 in Wayne.
   Rizzo introduced the resolution.
   Hoffa is the subject of a recent deluge of jokes generated by a
Playboy magazine interview with a federally protected witness,
Donald ``Tony the Greek'' Frankos. Frankos told the magazine
Hoffa's body was buried near the west endzone of Giants Stadium in
East Rutherford.
   Hoffa disappeared July 30, 1975.
   Gov. Thomas H. Kean, seeking to boost Republican Rep. James
Courter's gubernatorial bid, invoked Hoffa's name Sept. 22 in
taking a political poke at the Democratic nominee, Rep. James
Florio.
   ``Trying to find out where Jim Florio stands is like trying to
find out where Jimmy Hoffa is buried _ and it's not under Giants
Stadium,'' Kean told GOP supporters who joined President Bush for a
party fund-raiser.
   Hoffa jokes have also made the rounds on late-night television.

<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured
goods rose 2.9 percent in August, the government said Tuesday, but
analysts said a one-month boost from automobile orders belies the
weakness in the industrial sector.
   The Commerce Department reported that orders for both durable
and nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $237.2 billion
after declining 2 percent in July to $230.5 billion, the lowest
level since last November. Orders rose 0.6 percent in June.
   The August gain was driven by the transportation sector, which
rose 6.9 percent despite a decline in the aircraft component.
Orders for automobiles posted a big increase because of
end-of-the-model-year sales incentives.
   ``But the auto sales were a temporary phenomenon,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New
York.
   ``Basically, the industrial sector has slowed down,'' he said.
``American consumers are spending less, exports are still strong
but ... they are falling down too. Domestic capital spending is
beginning to evaporate.''
   Steinberg said the factory sector would continue to be ``quite
sluggish'' for the rest of the year and into 1990.
   John Hagens, an economist at the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,
also sees the industrial sector continuing to slow,
``flip-flopping'' from one month to the next.
   The Commerce report showed orders for durable goods _ ``big
ticket'' items expected to last more than three year _ rose 3.9
percent in August, up from the 3.8 percent initially reported last
week. Nondurable goods orders were up 1.8 percent.
   In addition to transportation, the non-electrical machinery
durable goods component, which includes computers, registered a
gain, up 9.3 percent.
   But orders for electrical machinery fell 2.1 percent, mostly due
to defense communicaioons equipment, while primary metals were off
1.8 percent.
   In the influential category of non-defense capital goods, a
barometer of business investment plans, orders fell 10.1 percent in
August after rising 5.9 percent in July.
   Shipments of manufactured goods rose 5.6 percent, the sharpest
increase in the current economic expansion, which began in 1982.
Shipments had fallen 2.3 percent in July, the sharpest drop since
March 1986.
   Inventories rose 0.3 percent, the smallest increase in the last
two years, but Steinberg attributed this more to recently improved
inventory control than to increased demand.

   This rural community has been trying to
unload its former town hall building for several years, while
hoping a new owner won't kick out the only store in town.
   ``There's nothing much I can do. It's their property,'' store
owner Norman C. Bates said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   Bates, 58, who has been ill for some years, said he wouldn't
mind selling his business, although he doesn't feel town officials
appreciate the service he's provided.
   Bates has run the retail store for 35 years, paying the town
$100 a month rent.
   The store in this town of about 600, tucked into a fold of the
Berkshire Hills, is the only place to buy such necessities as bread
and milk, along with such traditional staples as penny candy, Bates
said. ``Some of it's a nickel or a dime now, though,'' he added.
   No one really knows how the store wound up in the old town hall
building, which was built in the early 1900s but has since been
replaced.
   ``That goes way, way back,'' said Selectman Chris Andersen. ``I
know that the upstairs part of the building has forever been a town
hall, that was closed down about three years ago because of fire
regulations.''
   ``That's where the town met and danced and ate and had their
meetings and everything,'' he said.
   Officials hoped a buyer would keep the store as a tenant,
although that was not a requirement of the sale. The closest town
is Adams, about eight miles away.
   Town residents first decided to sell the building and land in
1985, because it lacks the capital to make repairs.
   At first, a sale was delayed by a boundary dispute with the
next-door Savoy Baptist Church.
   After that was settled in 1988, voters put a special condition
on the sale that any buyer would have to continue to operate it as
a retail outlet. That effort to sell ended with no bids submitted.
   Now the building and land are up for sale without restrictions
and buyers would have to negotiate with Bates for the business,
Andersen said. No price was set for the store, he said.
   Store assistant Fran Kane said the store is in need of repairs,
particularly the leaking porch roof.
   She said Bates has suggested increasing the amount he pays the
town to get an official lease, making it worthwhile to do some
repair work. But, she said, that was rejected because of the desire
to sell.

   President Bush's plan for $9 million in U.S.
aid for the Nicaraguan elections moved ahead in Congress Tuesday
despite misgivings from Democrats who said the idea amounted to
blatant interference in another country's politics.
   The House Appropriations Committee, on a voice vote, sent the
measure to the full House after defeating a move to slash the
package to just $400,000 to pay for election observers. The House
was scheduled to take up the measure on Wednesday.
   Bush's proposal provides $5 million to the National Endowment
for Democracy, a quasi-governmental agency which promotes
democratic processes in other countries, and $4 million for other
``election support.''
   Some support could go directly to the opposition coalition
supporting presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro, who is
challenging Nicaragua's Sandinista-backed President Daniel Ortega.
   The panel earmarked portions of the $4 million for specific
organizations: $400,000 for an election observer team led by former
President Jimmy Carter; $400,000 for the Center for Training and
Election Promotion; and $250,000 for the Center for Democracy.
   One effect of the earmarks was to lower the maximum amount that
could go directly to the opposition coalition to about $1.5
million, with a like amount going to the Nicaraguan Supreme
Electoral Council as a tax required by Nicaraguan law.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., called the package ``a turkey'' and
``misguided,'' but urged fellow Appropriations Committee members to
send the measure to the full House in accord with a promise to Bush
by the House Democratic leadership.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., called the package necessary to
seize an opportunity ``to see whether democracy can be brought to
that country.''
   In a related development, House Intelligence Committee Chairman
Antony C. Beilenson, D-Calif., said the bill providing money for
the nation's intelligence agencies for next year contains no money
for covert U.S. involvement in the Feb. 25, 1990 election.
   The administration could undertake covert action only by coming
to Congress to ask for a transfer of money from other programs,
which would give lawmakers a chance to veto such a move, he said.
   ``Covertly supporting the opposition in Nicaragua would be
unwise as well as unnecessary and counterproductive,'' Beilenson
said in a Rules Committee hearing. ``We have accepted the
administration's statements that it will not embark on this path.''

<HEAD>Ruthless, Noreiga Dealt With Everyone From CIA to Colombian Cartels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega dealt
with everyone from the CIA to Colombian cocaine cartels as he
clawed his way to power in Panama and defied American efforts to
oust him.
   On Tuesday, elements of the Defense Forces claimed they had
deposed Noriega. But the wily strongman's whereabouts were not
known and forces loyal to Noriega said they were resisting a coup
attempt.
   Noriega, 51, rose from poverty to the pinnacle of Panamanian
power through the ranks of the Defense Forces. He was raised by
foster parents and joined the Defense Forces in 1962 after
attending military college in Peru on a scholarship.
   His ascent began when he caught the attention of an ambitious
young officer named Omar Torrijos.
   Less than a year after the charismatic Torrijos took power in a
1968 coup, he made Noriega, then an obscure major, chief of
intelligence with the rank of lieutenant colonel.
   It was like having the keys to the city. Noriega immediately
began assembling dossiers on everyone who counted in Panama.
Information was power.
   His new post also gave him jurisidiction over customs and
immigration, long lucrative sources of income for the military.
   Noriega's new job also put him in close contact with U.S.
intelligence agencies. He formed powerful alliances.
   When Torrijos died in an unexplained plane crash in 1981,
Noriega was poised to shoulder his way to the top of the Defense
Forces. In 1983, he assumed command of the 15,000-man force. Wealth
and power were his.
   He acquired a fleet of expensive cars, a home in Panama City's
most exclusive neighborhood and is reputed to have a finger in a
vast array of lucrative businesses, including hotels, maritime
services, gambling casinos, a television station, a dozen radio
stations, maritime services, duty-free liquor stores and
prostitution.
   Noriega exercised his power with ruthless assurance. He had
little tolerance for criticism. He would close newspapers for
months at a time and presidents served at his pleasure.
   The United States, long his close ally, began to move away from
Noriega after the headless body of one of his most vocal opponents,
Hugo Spadadora, turned up in a U.S. mailbag in Costa Rica.
   Spadadora had publicly accused Noriega of drug trafficking.
   The full break with Washington came in 1988, when two federal
grand juries in Florida indicted Noriega on charges drug
trafficking. He was accused of selling out his country to the drug
lords of Medellin, Colombia, of turning Panama into a drug
transshipment point and a haven for money laundering.
   The domestic opposition, heartened by the indictments, began to
intensify its campaign to force Noriega to resign. The United
States imposed crippling economic sanctions on Panama.
   The general didn't bend an inch.
   Instead, he cloaked himself in Torrijos' nationalist banner,
accusing the United States of plotting to renege on the 1977
treaties that put the Panama Canal in local hands at the end of the
century.
   Control of the canal, linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans,
has long been an emotional issue in Panama.
   When international observers said the opposition had won the May
7 general election, Noriega simply had the balloting annulled and
installed yet another president, the sixth since he took command of
the Defense Forces.
   Shortly after his indictment Noriega gave a dramatic speech that
seemed to epitomize the strongman and his steely intransigence.
   The strongman brandished a machete above his head, then brought
it crashing down on the podium.
   ``Ni un paso atras,'' he shouted, his pock-marked face
contorted. ``Not one step back.''

   A village submerged 50 years ago during
construction of one of Britain's largest reservoirs has reappeared
after a spell of dry weather.
   The foundations of Derwent village showed up in Ladybower
Reservoir near Sheffield.
   The village was abandoned by its 170 people and its buildings
were demolished during the construction of the reservoir in
1937-1939, which serves the cities of Sheffield, Derby, Nottingham
and Leicester but flooded part of the Derwent river valley.
   Frank Long, a sailing instructor at Underbank Reservoir near
Sheffield, said water there had dropped from its normal 58 feet to
28 feet, forcing him to abandon the sailing program for the rest of
the year.

<HEAD>Newspaper Editors Urged To Be `Fanatical' on Community Ties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's newspaper editors must be
``fanatical'' about developing ties to their communities if they
hope to reverse a slide in readership, the head of the Associated
Press Managing Editors said Tuesday.
   ``We must get closer to our communities,'' said Paul Janensch,
editor and general manager of The Rockland Journal-News in New York
City's suburban Rockland County, N.Y.
   ``Call it what you will _ customer obsession, putting the reader
first, serving the constituents _ we must do it better,'' he said.
``I firmly believe that if we build a strong rapport with our
communities, we will prosper. If we don't, we will fade away.''
   As he opened the annual APME convention, Janensch pointed to
figures showing that newspaper readership is declining.
   ``In 1967, about 73 percent of U.S. adults said they read a
newspaper every day,'' he said. ``Last year, the number was down to
51 percent.''
   Janensch said steadily declining readership ``confronts us with
the most serious problem facing newspapers today'' and said it even
hits markets where the economy is booming.
   ``If you are lucky enough to be in a growing market and your
circulation is going up, you may think you don't have a problem,''
he said.
   ``Wrong. Even where circulation is going up, net newspaper
penetration is going down. There are no exceptions.''
   Frequently lost in the daily pressure of publishing, Janensch
said, is the need to establish links between a newspaper and the
community.
   ``We all know the answer, but we lose sight of it solving our
day-to-day newsroom problems,'' he said. ``We lose sight of it
wrestling with budgets, performance evaluations and other
administrative matters.''
   ``Do you hear what the people in your community are saying about
your newspaper?'' he asked. ``Do you know what they like? Do you
know what ticks them off?''
   Surveying readers can't substitute for basics of business, such
as customer service, he said.
   ``Readership surveys can be useful, but they aren't enough,''
Janensch said. ``Surveys can't halt sliding readership unless the
editor and the editor's staff are fanatical about getting close to
the community.''
   While many are captivated by national news and big-name events,
most of America's newspapers survive by providing residents of the
community with information they need in their daily lives, he said.
   ``Is your newspaper first and foremost a local newspaper?''
asked Janensch. ``Do you care as much about the expansion of a
local business as you do about the national trade deficit?''
   In addition to building community ties, Janensch said, a
newspaper's staff must reflect the paper's market.
   ``Does your staff at all levels reflect the racial and ethnic
diversity of your target readership?'' he asked the editors. ``Are
about half of your staffers women? Do your staffers have roots in
the community?''
   Without that commitment to community, Janensch said, the steady
decline in newspaper readership will inevitably continue, costing
newspapers advertising revenue, and that in turn tightens budgets
and damages the news product.
   ``The New York Times might be able to survive with 10 or 15
percent of its primary market, but can you?'' Janensch asked
editors.
   The APME is an association of editors from member newspapers of
The Associated Press.

   Police said Tuesday a Liberian man
tried to storm the cockpit of a jet on which he was being deported
but was stopped by crew members and arrested.
   No one was injured in the incident Monday, according to a police
spokesman. He said the KLM A-310 Airbus was forced to abort its
takeoff and return to the terminal at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.
   The police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the man was overpowered by the jetliner's cabin staff as he ran up
the aisle toward the cockpit.
   The suspect was being deported to Liberia following the
rejection by Dutch authorities of his asylum request here, the
spokesman said.
   There was no immediate word how many people were aboard the
Airbus, which seats at least 260 people. The suspect was not
identified, in line with Dutch police practice.
   According to Dutch Television, the man was not under police
guard when the incident occurred. It was not immediately clear
whether the cockpit door was locked.
   Liberia is one of several African nations from where large
numbers of asylum seekers have been flocking to the Netherlands.
   Dutch authorities have said many of the refugees aren't victims
of political repression but come to Western Europe for economic
reasons.

   Here is the text of President Bush's remarks
in the Oval Office about the situation in Panama. He spoke to the
media at the outset of a meeting with visiting Soviet Defense
Minister Dmitri Yazov.
   Bush said he was bending his usual rules prohibiting questions
at photo opportunities, ``given the anxiety and the state of the
rumor mill.''
   Bush went on:
   ``The first concern that I have as president of the United
States is the safety of American citizens and of course that would
include American forces that are there under our treaty rights with
Panama.
   ``Secondly, there are a lot of rumors around. We are staying in
very close touch with South Com (Southern Command). We have very
able military officers who are advising us of the situation on the
ground.
   ``But beyond that I would simply add to the rumors if I
commented further. And we are watching the situation with the No. 1
priority the lives of Americans.
   ``There were rumors around that this was some American operation
and I can tell you that is not true.''
   Asked if he was willing to help the Panamanian Defense Forces,
Bush said:
   ``Again, that's part of the confusion. Nobody is sure what's
happening there. People on the ground have the best idea about that.
   ``But I would repeat in the hopes that it be conveyed instantly
to Panama: we have no argument with the Panamanian Defense Forces.
We have no argument with them. We've had good relations with the
Panamanian Defense Forces. Our argument has been, as has many other
countries, with Mr. Noriega who aborted the democratic will of the
people of Panama. And that's where our argument was and that's
where our argument is.
   ``And so if you can use all these cameras to get that message to
the people of Panama, I really think it would be a good thing for
peace and I think it would be a good thing in terms of a historic
relationship between our two countries that I value and that all
Americans want to see improved. So sally forth and do your best.''
   Bush refused to answer further questions.

   A Norwegian trawler has caught what may be

blackfish measuring 2 feet 5{ inches, reports said Tuesday.
   ``This fish is undoubtedly a sensation,'' Odd Laatun of the

   Laatun said the English blackfish, or schedophilus medusophagus,
usually measures up to about 2 feet.
   The fish was caught by the trawler Straadau last week and came
to the attention of Geir Jan Johansen, a reporter for the Egersund
local newspaper Dalane Tidende.
   ``A fishermen from the boat came to me with the fish and said
`Do what you want with it,''' Johansen told The Associated Press.
``I ended up having to take it home and put in my freezer.''
   Laatun said it will be sent to the national Zoological Museum in

<TEXT>
   A man who helped kill and dismember a
prostitute in Florida is violating his probation by being in New
York state, but Florida doesn't want him and New York officials
said Tuesday they can't hold him.
   James Whyte, 29, and two other men killed Kimberley Ann Hanlon
of Tampa, Fla., and cut up her body with a chain saw in March 1985.
Hanlon's body was found in a freezer three years later.
   After his arrest last year, Whyte pleaded guilty to charges of
second-degree murder, kidnapping and sexual battery. But he was
granted immunity for testifying against the other suspects, Irvin
Riley, 28, and James Bailey, 45.
   Whyte was placed on probation for 25 years and ordered not to
leave Florida. Bailey and Riley were sentenced to three consecutive
life terms in Florida state prison.
   Whyte fled Florida in violation of his probation and came to the
Gloversville area, about 40 miles west of Albany, where his
ex-girlfriend lives, authorities said.
   Amsterdam police arrested Whyte in June on a criminal
impersonation charge when he falsely identified himself after being
stopped for a traffic violation, said Montgomery County Sheriff's
Lt. Richard Emery.
   Whyte was jailed after authorities learned he had violated his
Florida probation. But after the maximum 90 days he had to be
released Sept. 25 because Florida authorities did not try to
extradite him, said Sheriff's Sgt. William Brown.
   Without an extradition request, there is nothing New York
officials can do to ship Whyte back to Florida, said Montgomery
County District Attorney Guy Tomlinson.
   ``Yes, he is violating his probation, and if he ever shows up in
Florida we will arrest him,'' Florida Assistant State Attorney
Michael Benito told the Amsterdam Recorder. ``But are there plans
to extradite him? No.''
   Whyte poses no danger, and if he had not testified ``these two
other characters, who should have been given the electric chair,
would be roaming the streets,'' Benito said.
   Whyte's ex-girlfriend, who spoke on condition she not be
identified, claims Whyte has threatened her several times since his
release. She said she has told local authorities about the threats.
   Gloversville Police Chief Michael Gancarz said he had not heard
about the threats.

<TEXT>
   Parents of a 4-year-old who died after a
swimming lesson described as strenuous have settled a lawsuit
against instructors and a beach resort for nearly $1 million.
   ``We still can't believe it happened,'' said Patricia Myers, who
watched at poolside while instructors huddled over her daughter,
Amber Nicole Myers, after she lost consciousness during a 50-yard
swim.
   Amber was taking a swimming lesson in August 1987 from George
Symons and Michael Hatton at the Tides Hotel and Bath Club Resort
in North Redington Beach.
   According to the lawsuit, Hatton made her swim two laps in the
75-foot pool. During the second lap the child, who had tearfully
complained of fatigue, lost consciousness and stopped breathing
with an instructor only a couple feet from her.
   The mother of another child in the class and an instruction
performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived,
but Amber never breathed on her own again and was placed on life
support equipment. She was removed from the equipment eight days
later and died.
   Patricia and Stephen Myers filed suit against the instructors
and Gulf Beach, which owns the resort, alleging negligence. They
settled Monday for $950,000.
   The couple said they will wage a personal campaign for state and
national laws requiring instructors and lifeguards be certified in
lifesaving skills and CPR.
   Brian Harrington, attorney for the resort and the instructors,
said the instructors were certified in lifesaving and CPR, more
qualified than was required by either U.S. Swimming, a sanctioning
association, or Florida law.
   The last thing Mrs. Myers remembers is Amber asking: ``Mommy,
how much longer is class? I don't want to swim the long way.''
   ``I'll always have a problem with that,'' Mrs. Myers, 32, said
through tears.
   Family attorney Bob Carroll said the couple decided to settle
rather than take the matter to court this week because of the
stress a trial would bring. ``They would have been reliving this
thing 1,000 times.''
   Harrington said the hotel is looking at the swim program to see
if changes need to be made. Hotel management ``wanted to get all
this over and done with first,'' he said.
   Harrington denied there were serious flaws with the program.
``If it were so deficient, how did it function for 35 years,''
teaching 8,000 to 10,000 swimmers in three generations, without
another death, he asked.

   A commission of business, union and political
leaders announced on Tuesday plans to study ways to make U.S.
workers more competitive with those in other industrialized
countries.
   The 34-member Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce
will be chaired by Ira Magaziner, an international business
authority, co-chaired by former Labor Secretaries Bill Brock and
Ray Marshall, and will include New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean and the
chief executives of Eastman Kodak, Corning Glass Works Inc., and
Apple Computer Co.
   The commission will study job skill development programs in
seven countries: the United States, West Germany, Sweden, Denmark,
Ireland, Japan and Singapore.
   According to Magaziner, the commission's final report, expected
next spring, will:
   _ Urge changes in U.S. secondary schools to ensure youngsters
graduate with job skills,
   _ Call for a ``second chance system'' for those out of high
school and out of work, and
   _ Urge creation of a system to update skills of existing U.S.
workers.
   ``The U.S. is in a race with time. From West Germany to
Singapore, those nations that are winning the economic war have
made the development and effective use of very highly skilled work
forces an indispensible part of their strategy,'' said Magaziner.
   ``The U.S. knows it is far behind in the schooling process, but
it has hardly begun to think about an equally pressing problem _
how to raise the skills of line workers already in the workforce,''
he said.
   Research is expected to take seven months, Magaziner said. The
project will consist of more than 2,000 interviews with plant
executives, employees and policymakers in those seven nations. It
is being funded by a $250,000 grant from Carnegie Corp. of New York.
   The commission is an initiative of the National Center on
Education and the Economy, in Rochester, N.Y., an organization
founded in 1987 as an outgrowth of ``A Nation Prepared: Teachers
for the 21st Century,'' a landmark Carnegie report widely credited
with shifting U.S. school reform toward empowering teachers and
restructuring schools.
   Marc Tucker, author of that report, is president of the
Rochester-based center.
   Besides Magaziner, Kean, Brock and Marshall, the commission will
include:
   Morton Bahr, president, Communications Workers of America;
Edward J. Carlough, president, Sheet Metal Workers of America;
Anthony P. Carnevale, vice president, American Society for Training
and Development; Paul J. Choquette, Jr., chief executive officer,

1,000 people stranded outside the baroque Lobkowicz Palace that
houses it. Between 4,000 and 5,000 people, including some 1,500
children, were packed into the compound at the time, and Red Cross
officials feared sanitation problems.
   Shortly after noon, the desperation peaked. Witnesses saw groups
of newcomers rush toward the fence of the compound, which was
blocked by a police barricade.
   When police tried to stop them, the refugees pulled down the
barricade. Police resorted to their truncheons. ``They clubbed like
mad,'' a Czechoslovak eyewitness reported.
   More people from the waiting crowd surged toward where the
beatings took place. In only minutes, almost 300 thronged the
narrow passage toward a six-foot fence into the embassy garden.
Police beat them as they passed, and many reached the fence
bleeding.
   Those who broke through scaled the fence. Refugees quickly built
``a human ladder'' to help many clear the hurdle, the witnesses
said.
   Many got caught on the sharp spikes at the top of the fence and
others jumped or fell head-first to the ground. Some were later
seen lying unconscious inside the compound, the witnesses said.
   Outside the embassy, families with small children were unable to
get inside. They said they feared police retaliation.
   Later, when the situation had calmed down somewhat, young men
were still seen climbing the embassy facade from a truck. They were
pulled in through windows by other refugees.

   A $25,000 Mercedes-Benz registered to
singer-actress Appolonia was impounded along with 42 other vehicles
during a crackdown on street drug dealers and buyers, authorities
said.
   Police Chief Daryl Gates displayed the 1985 Mercedes of Patricia
``Appolonia'' Bernhardt, 30, with several other cars at a news
conference Monday.
   Ms. Bernhardt was arrested for investigation of possessing a
small amount of marijuana during the weekend ``Operation Hammer''
raids that netted 1,009 arrests, said Officer Don Lawrence.
   Appolonia appeared in the movie ``Purple Rain'' and had a
one-season role on the nighttime TV soap opera ``Falcon Crest.''
   Since the program began in 1984, police have seized and sold
some 840 vehicles worth about $4.3 million, Lawrence said.

<HEAD>After Accident, Dog Makes Recovery _ on Two Legs</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto DC2</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A dog can get around on three legs, but
Rusty is a 40-pound dog with two legs who has learned to do
practically everything normal dogs do.
   ``He might be a step or two slower than he was with four legs
but not much more than that,'' said owner Bill Davis. ``He's quick
enough that I'm back to using him with the cattle. He can run
around them and get them moving just like he used to.''
   Rusty learned to run on his two right legs after a hay mower
accident July 1 nearly killed the animal and left his left legs
dangling as useless stubs. The stubs swing back and forth when he
moves, but they don't touch the ground.
   Davis is amazed, as are visitors to his farm.
   ``Come to think of it, the only thing he can't do that he could
before is jump a fence,'' he said.
   ``When it happened, I'd been out mowing the end rows of my oat
field and I was coming back in,'' Davis said. ``I came around the
corner of the hog house and there was Rusty. It happened so quick I
couldn't get stopped in time. The mower went right over it.
   ``He was just motionless there underneath it, bleeding but still
alive. I'll tell you, it was like running over your own kid. Well,
almost. It about made me sick.''
   Davis, 35, raced to the office of veterinarian Dr. Eric
Christianson, who agrees the recovery was remarkable.
   ``Yeah, it is amazing. It's not like we have physical therapy in
veterinary medicine. But just the fact that he survived is
something, considering how bad he was hurt.''
   Christianson said the dog had lost a lot of blood by the time
Davis brought him in ``and it was a close call whether were going
to try to save him or put him to sleep. We decided to give it a try
and if it didn't work, or if the dog wasn't having much of a life
afterward because of just having two legs, we could put him to
sleep later.''
   The veterinarian said the dog survived the accident because the
3-year-old red heeler was in good shape at the time.
   ``But the biggest factor is that this dog has a real will to
live, a heck of a lot of character. Most animals would have given
up,'' Christianson said.

<HEAD>Maverick District Topples Texas School Funding System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In hot, dimly lit classrooms, students
in the Edgewood Independent School District have learned what it
means to struggle.
   Most come from poor families in the predominantly Hispanic
southwest section of San Antonio. At school, in buildings in need
of extensive renovation, they have had few specialized classes and
fewer sports programs.
   But their dropout rate is low. Their superintendent is
recognized by educators statewide. And pride pervades.
   This is where the battle began to topple Texas' public school
finance system, to gain financial equality between rich and poor
districts, and where students, educators, lawyers and legislators
rejoiced Monday over the unanimous Texas Supreme Court ruling
declaring the finance system unconstitutional.
   The court gave the Texas Legislature until May 1 to come up with
a solution.
   ``When we first began the lawsuit, nobody wanted to join with
us. We were sort of the Lone Ranger,'' Edgewood Superintendent
James Vasquez said Tuesday.
   But that had never bothered this maverick district.
   In 1968 Edgewood resident Demetrio Rodriguez led a group of
parents and students in suing for equality between rich and poor
school districts.
   That lawsuit ended in 1973 when the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned a three-judge federal panel that had ordered the Texas
Legislature to devise a constitutional funding system.
   Rodriguez and others remained involved in the battle, and in
1984, with the help of the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund, the district began the winning legal war with the
state.
   While the school district had its doubts, Vasquez said, it never
considered abandoning the fight. That same determination has pushed
the district during its 84-year history, he said.
   ``We've got to fight for everything we get. I think that spirit
moves us forward,'' said Vasquez, who has been with Edgewood 30
years as a teacher, vice principal, principal, assistant
superintendent and now superintendent.
   The 15,500-student district is 95 percent Hispanic and covers a
section of San Antonio with 87,000 residents, many of whom are poor
or work at one of several nearby military bases, school board
president Pete Gonzales said.
   Part of the district's problem has been that its property base,
used to determine taxation, is mostly low-income housing or
military installations. Though the federal government pays the
district about $200,000 a year, the bases cannot be taxed.
   The lack of money means Edgewood spends about $3,600 per pupil
per year. Other Texas school districts spend anywhere from $2,100
to $19,300 per pupil, depending on the district's tax base.
   Compounding the problem, Gonzales contends, is the higher
concentration in low-income districts of students with special
needs, meaning more money must be spent on them and even less
channeled toward so-called ``mainstream'' students.
   The school district's priorities, Vasquez said, are implementing
innovative programs to curtail the dropout rate, paying teachers
competitive salaries and renovating buildings.
   Some of the buildings need complete refurbishing and many don't
have air conditioning, which Vasquez considers a necessity in San
Antonio, where Monday's temperature reached 95 degrees.
   Vasquez is proud of the school district's relatively low dropout
rate. At 23 percent, it compares favorably with the approximate 50
percent average statewide for Hispanic youths.
   Former Edgewood students typically stay involved with the
district and offer help once they are established in their careers,
Vasquez said.
   ``They've lived the experience, they know what it's like out
there, and they want to come back and make things better,'' the
superintendent said. ``It's like a family.''
   Vasquez has had numerous offers to go elsewhere. He has lectured
on school financing at most major Texas universities, served on
state education task forces and is co-founder of the Austin-based
Equity Center, which includes more than 200 school districts and
has its own budget and staff to study school financing.
   He sees the Texas Supreme Court ruling not only as a victory for
his students but for all Texas children.
   Vasquez spent much of Monday explaining to his students that
they were part of history. But, he said, he is still trying to make
himself believe it.
   ``I think that will sink into me one of these days,'' he said.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Powerful Drug, Program to Check for Side Effects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government Tuesday approved a new
drug to treat severe schizophrenia and a unique monitoring program
in which patients using the drug will be tested weekly for signs of
a potentially fatal side effect.
   The Food and Drug Administration said the drug, clozapine, can
be used only for patients who have not responded to at least two
regimens of standard, less toxic therapy.
   An estimated 200,000 people could benefit from the drug, the FDA
said.
   The drug has been shown to relieve the symptoms of severe
schizophrenia, allowing patients to lead more productive lives.
   But the drug also can cause a potentially fatal blood disorder
called agranulocytosis, in which the level of infection-fighting
white blood cells is reduced. Studies have shown the condition can
be reversed if caught early.
   Under the monitoring system, a home health care company will
distribute the prescribed medication to patients each week and
collect blood samples that will be sent to a national laboratory
for analysis, the FDA said.
   If the test results indicate the patient must stop taking the
drug, the patient's doctor will be notified immediately by
telephone.
   The testing program was proposed by Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corp.
of East Hanover, N.J., which will market the drug under the trade
name Clozaril.
   It is believed to be the first time the FDA has approved such a
testing plan along with a new drug, an agency spokeswoman said.
   Agranulocytosis occurs in 1 percent to 2 percent of patients
taking clozapine, said Sandoz spokesman David Winter.
   In each of the 15 cases of the blood disorder that occurred
during testing, the side effect was caught early enough for the
condition to be reversed. The FDA said, however, that ``even with
the careful monitoring system planned, some fraction of patients
who develop agranulocytosis may die.''
   The drug is also associated with seizures.
   FDA Commissioner Frank Young acknowledged the serious risks
associated with use of the drug, but said, ``The severity and
hopelessness of unremitting chronic schizophrenia was an important
factor in the decision to approve clozapine.''
   Schizophrenia can be incapacitating without effective treatment,
often leaving the patient incoherent, plagued by continual fear and
threatening hallucinations, and unable to care for themselves.
   Clozapine was first evaluated in the early 1960s by Sandoz Ltd.
of Basel, Switzerland, and marketed in several foreign countries.
But its development as an antipsychotic drug in the United States
was abandoned and the drug was taken off the market in other
countries in the mid-1970s when it was linked to agranulocytosis
with several deaths in Finland.

   A judge issued an arrest warrant
Tuesday for the half-brother of actor Larry Hagman after a
financial institution accused him of making off with money
entrusted to him as an attorney.
   County Judge Glen Densmore issued the warrant for Gary Hagman,
48.
   ``Mr. Hagman was the attorney representing a group of people in
a financial transaction,'' Police Chief Jerry Blaisdell said. ``But
those parties did not receive those funds nor the account.''
   Hagman's wife reported him missing on Sept. 26. He and the actor
share a father.
   Blaisdell would not say how much money was involved. He also
would not name the parties involved.
   The warrant charged misapplication of fiduciary funds, a
second-degree felony that carries a two- to 20-year prison term and
a fine of up to $10,000.

<HEAD>Pool Closed after Lifeguards Fall Ill with Rare Respiratory Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTMINSTER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials will test
water from a city pool closed Tuesday in a search for the cause of
a rare respiratory problem diagnosed in four lifeguards.
   ``I have my fingers and toes crossed that maybe this will give
us the answers we're looking for,'' said Pierrette Ray, the city's
risk-management officer.
   Two lifeguards were diagnosed last month and two were diagnosed
last week with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a rare allergic
reaction to prolonged exposure to various organic dusts and
chemicals.
   ``They're sick in that they feel tired all the time, just like
if you have a real bad case of the flu,'' Ms. Ray said.
   The four lifeguards also have runny noses and runny eyes. Three
were assigned other city jobs and one quit to return to school.
   ``In my mind there's no doubt there's a problem with the pool.
But we don't know what it is,'' said Dr. Cecile Rose of the
National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine in
Denver. She diagnosed three of the four cases.
   The national Centers for Disease Control and Harvard University
Medical Center will test water samples shipped them Monday for a
small protozoa called acanthamoeba, which has been associated with
the disease, said Govinda Visvesvara, research biologist with the
CDC's division of parasitic diseases.
   Some types of the protozoa are resistant to chlorine.
   Water and air tests so far have turned up no cause for the
illnesses. Results of the additional tests were expected in two to
three weeks.
   The indoor pool was closed pending the additional test results
and to avoid any harm to the pool's 19 other lifeguards, who will
be tested, Ms. Ray said.

<HEAD>Legislators Rebuff Gorbachev Call for Total Ban on Strikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev suffered his first
major policy defeat in the 4-month-old Soviet legislature Tuesday
when it rejected his call for an emergency ban on workers' newly
won right to strike.
   But Gorbachev told lawmakers he was satsified with a compromise
that imposes a selective ban on strikes in critical industries. He
said it would ``help restore a normal life.''
   Gorbachev said Monday he wanted a ban on all strikes for the
next 15 months to prevent anarchy from overwhelming the shaky
Soviet economy. A wave of strikes, largely over ethnic and
political conflicts, cost the country $6.5 billion in July and
August alone.
   Strikes were ruthlessly suppressed for decades until Gorbachev
began his effort to turn the country from a dictatorship into one
ruled by law. It was only last year that workers began to succeed
in pressuring for change by walking off the job.
   It was the first time the new Supreme Soviet legislature stood
up to the government and opted for its own policy, though it had
previously rejected several Cabinet nominees. The legislature's
display of independence was particularly significant because it
came on a package of emergency measures.
   The compromise resolution, adopted by a vote of 364-6, prohibits
strikes in the transport, energy, raw materials and metallurgy
industries, but only until the legislature passes a detailed law
defining the right to strike.
   That could be as soon as Monday, at the next session of the full
legislature. Nearly half the articles in the strike law were
approved Tuesday.
   The more controversial sections, which have yet to face floor
debate, would ban strikes that threaten human life or health, as
well as any aimed at overthrow of the government or violation of
ethnic equality. It also would ban strikes in the transportation,
communications, energy and defense industries, and among civil
servants.
   The draft also requires arbitration before a strike and allows
the Supreme Soviet or its ruling Presidium to halt or delay strikes.
   It also says those found responsible for a strike can be fired
and fined up to three months' pay to help cover economic damages.
It does not define responsibility, leaving open the possibility
that managers who fail to resolve labor disputes could be held as
guilty as strike leaders.
   All of these points still await debate.
   The emergency resolution adopted also permits the country's
ministries of interior, defense and transport to guarantee
operation of the railroads in Armenia and Azerbaijan if necessary
to get rail traffic moving again to Armenia.
   Strikers in Azerbaijan motivated by ethnic demands created a
virtual economic blockade of Armenia by interfering with shipments
on the main rail and road lines to the neighboring republic.
Armenia and Azerbaijan are locked in a conflict over the disputed
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which has also been hit by lengthy
strikes. Trains ship about 80 percent of the goods Armenia receives
from elsewhere in the Soviet Union.
   In July, thousands of coal miners walked off the job demanding
more consumer goods and control over mining operations. They
returned to work only after Moscow agreed to a package of economic
and social improvements that officials say will cost about $3
billion.
   Legislators from four committees who worked through the night on
Gorbachev's proposal to ban strikes originally offered him a
complete rebuff. Their weakened draft resolution, presented to the
Supreme Soviet Tuesday morning, did not even mention any ban on
strikes.
   During the debate, a deputy suggested prohibiting strikes only
in key industries.
   Gorbachev responded by repeating his warning that the Soviet
economy is threatened by waves of politically motivated job
actions. But he did not call again for an outright ban on all
strikes.
   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin told reporters the blanket ban
was rejected by the legislative group as unconstitutional.
   ``We don't have a basis for deciding what is an extraordinary
situation,'' he said.
   Leonid Abalkin, a deputy premier in charge of economic reform,
confirmed that a dramatically different draft resolution came
during the overnight meeting of deputies and not from Gorbachev.
Speaking to reporters during a break in debate, he made it clear
that Kremlin leaders believe strong action is needed, and
criticized the deputies for caving into public pressure.
   ``Everyone wants to be sympathetic, wants the public to like
them, and nobody wants to take the responsibility,'' he said.
   Gorbachev received support from a number of liberals. Marju
Lauristin, a deputy and leader of the Estonian Popular Front, said
during a break she favored limits on strikes over political issues
because they damage the economy and could be used as an excuse for
military intervention.
   Russian workers in Estonia went on strike during the summer to
protest voting laws they say favor the majority Estonians.

<HEAD>Democrats Invite Walesa to Address Congress, Outline Aid Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was invited to
address a joint meeting of Congress Tuesday as Senate and House
Democrats announced an ambitious effort to help Poland and Hungary
make the leap from communism to democracy.
   Democratic leaders of both chambers dismissed President Bush's
$219 million package of initiatives in Eastern Europe as a
``grossly inadequate'' response to an historic opportunity to
bolster democracy and free enterprise in the region and to end the
40-year Cold War with victory for the West.
   They spelled out a legislative program _ with a potential total
value of more than $3.7 billion _ composed of loans from
international financial institutions, direct American aid and loans
and a five-year halt in Polish payments on its U.S. bank debt.
   ``Bold action today will be far less costly than timidity,''
said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ``For if we
hesitate, and the opportunity is lost, we will be paying for it for
a long, long time _ in an escalating arms race ...''
   Escalating the partisan attack on Republican inititives for
Eastern Europe, Gephardt said it is ironic that a government which
doubled U.S. military spending to respond to a Soviet military
threat, ``now seems curiously paralyzed, unable to respond to the
possibility of economic freedom, democracy and peace breaking out
in Eastern Europe ...''
   But Raymond Seitz, assistant secretary of State for European
affairs, denying such paralysis exists, said Poland's new plan for
restructuring its centralized economy is ``in many respects a
declaration of economic independence.''
   Seitz told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that a Polish
request for a $1 billion loan to stabilize the economy is ``under
very active review at very high levels. There will be a response to
that shortly.'' ''
   The invitation to Walesa to address a joint meeting of Congress
on Nov. 15 was extended by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.,
and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Walesa, who had already announced plans to visit the United
States, is expected to accept.
   Both Democratic leaders compared the proposal to the aid
announced so far by Bush, with Mitchell calling the president's
``woefully inadequate.''
   ``The Bush program is grossly inadequate,'' said Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich. ``We intend to provide the leadership that has
been lacking up to now.''
   The Democratic aid package includes $887 million in new U.S.
economic and food assistance to Poland and Hungary, of which it is
contemplated that $415 million would be appropriated for use in the
1990 fiscal year which opened on Sunday.
   This would include some $125 million in immediate food aid.
   The plan builds on and expands the private-sector Enterprise
Fund proposed by Bush during his visit to Warsaw last summer. It
would help fund a host of small-scale projects, encourage joint
commercial ventures with Western corporations, and work to
establish private businesses in the two countries.
   The Democratic aid plan includes trade credit insurance, health
programs, scholarships and scientific and labor exchanges. It calls
for a coordinated aid effort by the Overseas Private Investment
Corp., the Peace Corps, the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the Labor
Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.
   It calls for the use of the Treasury Department's Exchange
Stabilization Fund to make available up to $1 billion in loans to
Poland.
   ``Our package will instruct the secretary to use that fund for
bridge loans to Poland, which they can use to repay debts, buy the
materials necessary for industrial restructuring, and jump start
their economy,'' Gephardt said.
   The plan would also give Poland breathing space by halting, for
five years, payments on its $2.5 billion debt to U.S. lending
institutions.
   Another element of the proposal would instruct U.S.
representatives to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund
to seek $1.4 billion in bridge loans for Poland and Hungary.

   Spurred by concerns about scientific misconduct,
a prestigious medical journal will require study authors to hand
over their raw data for examination if requested, the journal
editor said Tuesday.
   The journal also will tighten its requirement on disclosing
financial interests involved in the research, said George Lundberg
of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The steps are among requirements being imposed to protect the
credibility of the journal, Lundberg said. The requirements will
take effect when they are announced in next week's issue, he said
at a science reporters conference sponsored by the AMA.
   ``We're calling attention to all these things, hoping by
education or intimidation to keep things straight,'' he said in an
interview.
   To get research published in the journal, scientists will have
to sign a pledge that they will let editors examine their raw data
if the editors ask for it, Lundberg said. That will help in
detecting misrepresentation of data or fraud, he said.
   The journal already asks authors to disclose financial interests
in their work, and ``we've trusted authors to level with us,''
Lundberg said. The journal will go a step further by requiring a
signed certification.
   Financial interests include who paid for the research, who
employs the researchers, whether a researcher owns stock in a
company that would be affected by the study and whether the
scientist is a paid consultant to such a company.
   Such information may be published along with the study, Lundberg
said.
   Study authors also will have to certify that they participated
in the reported work enough to take public responsibility for it.
Lundberg said that is aimed at the practice of ``honorary
authorship,'' in which a listed author may not have played a
meaningful role in the study.
   In some recent medical fraud cases, distinguished scientists who
were listed as authors had never seen the paper and did not even
know the reported research was bogus, he said. But the appearance
of their names on the papers lent the works credence, he said.
   Authors also will have to vouch for the validity of the study
and certify that they had reviewed and approved the final
manuscript.
   If an author lies in making the newly required statements, the
journal may publish a notice about it, Lundberg said.
   In a separate presentation at the conference, a prominent heart
disease researcher said federal funding for biomedical research
should be set as a fixed fraction of the nation's spending on
health care.
   Without such steps to assure adequate funding in the future, the
field will have trouble attracting young researchers and replacing
antiquated equipment, said Antonio Gotto of Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston.
   That in turn would endanger its ability to conduct the science
that leads to new products for health care, he said.
   In 1985, the nation spent $458 billion, or about 10.8 percent of
its gross national product, on health care costs, he said.
   Federal funding of medical research has declined to about 1.2
percent of overall GNP from previous levels of 3 percent, he said.
A return to the previous level might be an appropriate target, he
said.
   Douglas Kelly, associate vice president for medical research of
the Association of American Medical Colleges, said he believed the
fixed-percentage idea is ``not very realistic politically.''
   It would convert research funding to an entitlement like Social
Security, and Congress would probably be reluctant to do that, he
said in an interview.

   The Bush administration urged East Germany on
Tuesday to work out an agreement with West Germany permitting the
emigration of thousands of additional refugees who have flocked to
Bonn's embassies in Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   But the best solution, the Bush administration said, would be
for the East Germany to establish permament procedures for people
to travel ``without hindrance from their government.''
   Under an agreement between the two Germanys, more than 6,000
East Germans were admitted to West Germany over the weekend.
Afterward, thousands of additional would-be emigrants went to the
West German embassies in Prague and Warsaw trying to follow their
countrymen.
   However, the East German government said the agreement was a
one-time humanitarian arrangement and demanded that Bonn not allow
the second influx to stay in its embassies.
   The Bush administration, through State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher, came down Tuesday on the side of the refugees by
invoking the 1975 Helsinki agreement, a 35-nation accord that
pledged a freer flow of people and ideas between East and West.
   Having signed the accord, Boucher said, the East German
government is ``responsible to meet that commitment.'' The U.S.
official also praised West Germany for providing a home for fellow
Germans.
   But the statement read by Boucher also suggested that East
Germany, one of the strictest Communist states in Europe, could
help keep its people from leaving by undertaking reforms.
   ``We believe that in order to remove the conditions which caused
so many people to flee to the West, the GDR (German Democratic
Republic) leadership should institute reforms which will lead to a
political and economic system responsive to the population of East
Germany,'' Boucher said.
   He said the ``root cause'' of the situation was that people do
not want to live in East Germany.
   ``If you're going to have a way of resolving the situation in
the long run, there are going to have to be political and economic
reforms in East Germany that will make it a more livable place for
people.''
   Still, the U.S. official stressed the view that East Germans
under the Helsinki agreement have a right to go to the West.
Boucher said the agreement specified ``a very clear freedom to
travel and freedom of emigration.''
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Assistant Secretary of State Raymond
G.H. Seitz reaffirmed U.S. support for the eventual reunification
of East and West Germany but said that reunification must be
approached cautiously.
   ``It is correct that the history of the 20th century is a
history in which the unification of Germany led to instability and
to war. History tells us to be very cautious,'' Seitz said at a
congressional hearing.

   A federal prosecutor said Tuesday he was ready and
waiting to put Panamanian military ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega on trial on drug trafficking charges if a coup attempt
resulted in his extradition.
   Noriega was accused in a February 1988 indictment here of
accepting $4.6 million from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to
provide protection and services for traffickers smuggling cocaine
into the United States.
   He also faces a three-count marijuana-trafficking indictment in
Tampa.
   ``I am ready to try him as soon as his defense lawyers are
ready,'' U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said Tuesday.
   Noriega's attorney in Miami, Neal Sonnett, said he had no
comment on Tuesday's events in Panama, where soldiers opposed to
Noriega seized his headquarters.
   The Reagan administration once offered to drop the indictment if
Noriega would leave Panama, but that deal fell through.
   Now, Lehtinen said, ``The Bush administration is interested in
trying Noriega, and the major case against him is in Miami.''
   Other federal law enforcement officials said that without a
formal extradition order, Noriega might not be sent to Miami
initially, but could be detained at U.S. military bases. A formal
extradition treaty exists between the United States and Panama, but
it is not obligatory for either nation.
   The 12-count indictment against Noriega in Miami, upheld by a
federal judge in January, also includes charges against Medellin
cartel leader Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
   The indictment alleges that Noriega protected drug shipments
through Panama, arranged for cocaine-processing chemicals, allowed
traffickers to set up a processing laboratory in his country, and
laundered cartel profits through Panamanian banks.
   Noriega also allegedly sheltered some of the cartel leaders
after the assassination of Colombian Minister of Justice Rodrigo
Lara-Bonilla, according to the indictment.
   But at one point, the indictment said, he raided the cartel
laboratory, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro allegedly mediated the
resulting dispute between Noriega and the cartel.
   The Tampa indictment accuses Noriega of accepting $1 million to
allow the importation of 1.4 million pounds of marijuana.
   No one has been tried under either indictment.

<TEXT>
   Angola's Marxist government and the U.S.-armed
rebels opposing it are waging their battle in Washington's public
relations arena this week.
   The Bush administration is holding open house for both sides,
scheduling meetings with Angolan Foreign Minister Pedro van Dunem _
despite the absence of diplomatic relations with his government _
and a White House visit with President Bush for Jonas Savimbi,
leader of the Angolan rebels.
   In addition, at the administration's urging Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko is paying a quick visit to Washington on Wednesday
and will meet with President Bush at the White House, officials
said. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
main agenda item would be Angola and the strains between Savimbi
and Mobutu.
   Mobutu, who has helped funnel U.S. arms to Savimbi's Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), appears to have shifted
his allegiance in recent weeks, openly supporting Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
   The U.S. diplomatic efforts are designed to head off a final
collapse of Zairean-mediated truce accords reached last June
between Savimbi, one of the largest recipients of U.S. covert aid,
and the Soviet-backed government.
   The truce began coming apart soon after it went into effect, and
subsequent negotiations between the sides on a permanent agreement
ending their 14-year civil war have failed despite persistent State
Department efforts.
   UNITA is demanding free elections and a change in the country's
Marxist-oriented constitution.
   Savimbi, meanwhile, denies claims by Dos Santos that he agreed
to go into exile and to integrate his troops into Angola's army. He
says such contentions are a ruse to destroy UNITA politically after
the government failed to do so militarily.
   The two sides have refused to sit in the same room during
negotiations.
   In an interview after his arrival here, Savimbi said he was
prepared to meet with a high-level Angolan Foreign Ministry
delegation, which is due to arrive Wednesday.
   He also is urging a more active U.S. role in the negotiations
with Angola, similar to the American diplomacy last year that
helped bring about the complex agreement for the pullout of 50,000
Cuban troops from Angola and the granting of independence to
Namibia.
   Savimbi, who received his guerrilla training in China and until
last year got most of his military support from South Africa, is
aided by a powerful array of U.S. lobbyists and lawyers, led by the
firm of Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly.
   His nearly week-long agenda is packed with meetings on Capitol
Hill, the State Department and White House, as well as with
reporters and with businessmen seeking a foothold in mineral-rich
Angola.
   Van Dunem, the Angola government's foreign minister, is coming
to Washington for only one day, and his lobbyists and supporters
have organized meetings with State Department officials and
reporters to press for U.S. recognition of his government. ``The
U.S. is the only Western country which still doesn't recognize
Angola,'' said Randall Robinson, director of TransAfrica which is
lobbying for recognition of Angola.
   In another salvo between the sides, UNITA supporters led by Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, have asked Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to
investigate TransAfrica, accusing it of violating the Foreign
Agents Registration Act by accepting more than $2,000 from the
Angolan mission to the United Nations. ``I certainly never received
any money from Angola,'' Robinson said.
   Van Dunem's side-trip to Washington from the U.N. General
Assembly in New York is viewed by State Department officials as an
attempt to counter the effects of Savimbi's visit.
   A kit distributed by Fenton Communications, the firm that
handles Angola's public relations, includes a list of
demonstrations planned this week against Savimbi as well as copies
of recent newspaper articles critical of the rebel leader.
   Half-page ads this week in The Washington Post and The New York
Times, paid for by the Angolan government, said Savimbi was coming
here to press for more covert aid to augment the $40 million UNITA
is already getting.
   The ads cited an article in The National Review which described
UNITA as having ``a classic Marxist-Leninist structure with not a
vestige of democratic procedures.''
   A resolution introduced last week by 42 Democrats and 15
Republicans in the House calls on the Bush administration to
establish a liaison office in Luanda.
   But the administration, backed by conservatives such as Rep. Dan
Burton, has rejected granting any diplomatic ties until the
government agrees to hold free elections that would give UNITA a
shot at power-sharing.

<HEAD>Volunteers Offer Help to Defense Worker, But Terminal Patient Can't

   Volunteers have offered to fly a terminally
ill Defense Department employee home to Massachusetts after the Air
Force refused a request from the man's family for a free
air-ambulance flight.
   But the health of the employee, Avram Brody, had declined as of
Tuesday to the point where it may be too late for him to make a
transcontinental flight, his wife said.
   Brody, 25, was diagnosed last year with terminal brain cancer.
The three-year Defense Department computer operator who lives in
Palmdale, Calif., about 45 miles north of Los Angeles, sought a
free air-ambulance flight to Massachusetts from the Air Force. It
would have cost roughly $29,000 to hire a private air ambulance.
   Amy Brody said her husband wanted to return to Massachusetts
where he was born and raised so he could be among relatives and
friends for the last weeks of his life.
   Air Force officials refused, even when congressmen and a White
House aide were enlisted to help Brody. After the matter received
publicity last week, several volunteers offered to provide Brody's
flight home.
   ``We had a lot of very wonderful people call giving us offers to
travel,'' Mrs. Brody said. ``But they just don't feel he can travel
any more.''
   Mrs. Brody said she contacted U.S. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
Tuesday and told a staff member that she was no longer requesting
Air Force help.
   The Air Force said Brody failed to meet criteria for a free ride
courtesy of the government on several counts: he is not a uniformed
officer; the flight would have no impact on his chances of
survival; and his illness was not caused by his Defense Department
work.
   ``We knew going in that this was unlikely to have a happy
ending,'' said Brad Pearson, a client advocate for the
Massachusetts Office of Handicapped Affairs, who has been working
on the Brody case.
   Brody received several offers for free flights, Pearson said. A
New Hampshire man who read about Brody's plight contacted a state
representative from Brody's hometown of Norwood, Mass., and offered
to fly Brody home. A California-based company also offered a free
flight while a Virginia-based medical airlift service was contacted
about raising funds for a flight.
   Mrs. Brody, 26, said she did not know if her husband's condition
might improve enough to make a flight possible. Brody has already
outlasted the life expectation given by doctors by several months.
   ``We had a lot of good Samaritans calling and it's nice to know
that there are these kind of people in the world,'' Mrs. Brody said.

   There are 40,000 to 50,000 Americans in
Panama, including more than 12,000 troops stationed there under a
treaty with the Panamanian government, U.S. sources said Tuesday as
fighting flared between supporters and opponents of strongman
Maunel Antonio Noriega.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said U.S. citizens in
the country were being asked to stay home. The U.S. Southern
Command put its troops and civilian employes on the isthmus on
Delta Alert, its highest state of readiness.
   At the White House, President Bush said, ``The first concern
that I have as president of the United States is the safety of
American citizens and, of course, that would include American
forces that are there under our treaty rights with Panama.''
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said American
military personnel in Panama had been ordered to stay put and not
to travel outside the U.S.-owned facilities.
   Dependents were moved onto U.S. military installations July 1
because of rising tensions.
   Previous reports have put the total of Americans in Panama at
50,000.
   Lawrence Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs,
a private organization that monitors developments in Latin America,
estimated the figure at 40,000, including those in private
business, military retirees, and employees of the Panama Canal.
   Boucher said there are 48 employees in the U.S. Embassy.

   A nationwide credit company agreed Tuesday to
pay $275,000 in civil penalties in the largest settlement ever
obtained by the federal government under the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act.
   The Federal Trade Commission had charged the General Electric
Capital Corp. discriminated against applicants to its ``instant
credit'' program on the basis of age, sex, marital status and
receipt of income from public assistance.
   The record settlement came in a proposed consent decree filed by
the Justice Department in U.S. District Court in Conneticut. The
settlement ended a 4{-year FTC investigation.
   ``The decree does not constitute an admission by GE Capital of
the alleged violation and was signed by the company to avoid
protracted and expensive litigation,'' said GE Capital spokeswoman
Lisa Van Orden.
   According to the FTC complaint, a requirement by GE Capital that
persons applying for ``instant credit'' be employed full time
discriminated against the elderly and divorced women.
   The FTC said the policy was discriminatory because it didn't
take into account elderly and divorced women's incomes from
alimony, child support, separate maintenance, annuity, pension,
part-time employment, Social Security or other government programs.
   The alleged violations occurred in 1985 and 1986 at furniture,
department, discount, appliance, do-it-yourself, and lawn and
garden stores nationwide where GE Capital offered credit for
consumer purchases.

   The Soviet Union has bought 2 million metric
tons of U.S. corn, the first for delivery in the just-begun
marketing year under a long-term supply agreement, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   Rumors had been circulating in the grain trade that the Soviets
were in the market for a large order of U.S. corn. The seventh year
of the long-term agreement between the two countries began on Oct.
1.
   Officials said U.S. grain sales to Moscow in 1988-89, the sixth
year of the agreement, were a record of more than 21.7 million
tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4
million tons of wheat.
   In addition, 1988-89 sales included 442,500 tons of soybeans,
1.35 million tons of soybean meal, and 1.02 million tons of grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 2 million tons of
corn would be about 78.8 million bushels.
   The sales were made by unidentified private exporting companies,
who are required by law to report large sales to the department. No
selling prices or further details were released.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.22 per bushel at the
farm level, according to the department's five-day average, meaning
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $175 million.
   The agreement was extended last year until Dec. 31, 1990.
Meanwhile, the United States and the Soviet Union are preparing to
begin preliminary talks in Moscow on Dec. 4 for a new long-term
agreement to succeed the current pact.
   Under the current agreement, the Soviets are committed to buy at
least 9 million tons of grain annually, including a minimum of 4
million tons each of wheat and corn, and 1 million tons which can
be wheat, corn, soybeans and soybean meal, or any combination of
those.
   The pact also allows Moscow to buy up to 3 million tons of
additional wheat and corn annually without further discussions. If
more than 12 million tons are wanted, however, the United States
must be consulted.

   A Chinese man who was arrested after requesting
political asylum in Hong Kong was allowed to leave for the United
States on Tuesday night, officials reported.
   A government spokesman said Yang Yang, 20, was released under a
discretionary section of the immigration code.
   Yang sought political asylum in the British colony after his
tourist visa expired in August. He said he had joined pro-democracy
marches in Hong Kong and feared authorities would jail him if he
returned to China.
   He got no response from the Hong Kong government, and
immigration officials arrested him Sept. 23 because his visa had
expired.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Information Service said the American
consulate received Yang's application and supporting documents
Tuesday and granted him a non-immigrant visa of limited duration.
   He refused to reply when asked what the U.S. response would be
if Yang asked for asylum.
   U.S.-Chinese relations have been strained since the U.S Embassy
in Beijing gave refuge to prominent dissidents Fang Lizhi and his
wife Li Shuxian soon after Chinese soldiers crushed the student
pro-democracy movement in June.
   Thousands of people involved in the movement were arrested.
   Five days after Yang's arrest, Taiwan issued an entry permit to
him under a policy of offering refuge to leaders of the
pro-democracy movemnt. Liang Yung-chang, director of the
semi-official Free China Relief Association in Taipei, said about
60 other mainland Chinese now in Hong Kong were eligible for
similar permits.
   Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, issued a statement in
Hong Kong saying Chinese who had participated in pro-democracy
activities in Hong Kong would not face reprisals when they returned.
   Under the treaty between China and Britain, Hong Kong will
revert to Chinese rule in 1997.

<HEAD>Bush's Pick For Spain Ambassador Criticized But Easily Confirmed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate easily approved President Bush's
nomination of a Florida businessman to be ambassador to Spain on
Tuesday, but some Democrats used the occasion to accuse Bush of
abusing diplomatic posts as political rewards.
   The businessman, 55-year-old Joseph Zappala, is one of several
Bush appointees who have become lightning rods for accusations that
the administration is handing out ambassadorships to wealthy but
unqualified campaign contributors. However, the Senate confirmed
him on a 79-20 vote.
   Zappala, a St. Petersburg, Fla., real estate developer, is not
college educated, has no foreign service experience and does not
speak Spanish. He received an ``unqualified'' rating from the
American Academy of Diplomacy, a respected body which evaluates
ambassadorial nominees.
   But Democrats are quick to point out that he also gave a
reported $126,000 to Republican campaigns in recent years and
actively raised money for Bush's 1988 presidential bid.
   The nominee has shown ``no interest in the people, politics or
history of Spain,'' said Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I. ``I am forced to conclude that the
main reason for Mr. Zappala's nomination was his fund raising ...
and contributions.''
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., a member of the Foreign Relations
panel, said Bush has appointed ``an unusual number'' of such people
to head embassies around the world. He said of 58 ambassadorial
nominations Bush has sent to Congress for confirmation, 22 have
been career foreign service officers and 36 have been political
appointees.
   ``To the world at large, this says the United States is not
serious about diplomacy,'' Sarbanes said during debate on the
nomination Monday. ``No other major industrial nation appoints its
nominees in this way.''
   In the case of Spain, Sarbanes noted, democracy is relatively
new, dating from the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.
Recognizing the sensitivity of the position, presidents since then
have appointed only professional diplomats as U.S. ambassadors to
Madrid, he said.
   But Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., defended the nominee, saying
his background ``is far broader than that of many senators.''
Zappala's resume shows he has been an active GOP fund-raiser and
headed local charity and drug-rehabilitation organizations. ``He is
a businessman ... who has branched out far beyond the community
where he began,'' Boschwitz said.
   And Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., argued that foreign governments
often are glad to host an ambassador who, while not a
foreign-policy expert, is a close friend of the president. ``There
are some indications that the government of Spain is pleased to
have that kind of direct connection,'' he said.
   Zappala barely survived the confirmation process in the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, which voted 10-9 to send his name to
the full Senate. An exasperated Sarbanes then termed Zappala a
``political throwaway'' and said Bush might as well put the
diplomatic posts up for public auction and use the money to defray
the public debt.

   Nine sheriff's deputies were suspended
Tuesday in a probe into allegations of money skimming in the
department's narcotics bureau, officials said.
   A total of 18 deputies have now been suspended. Nine deputies
attached to the narcotics bureau were suspended five weeks ago in
connection with the investigation called ``Operation Big Spender.''
   Investigators say thousands of dollars seized in narcotics raids
may have been stolen.
   Twenty search warrants were also served, said Deputy Chris Wahla
of the Sheriff's Information Bureau. Among the homes searched were
those of the nine deputies suspended Tuesday, one retired deputy
and one police officer from another agency, Wahla said.
   Authorities refused to release the names of the deputies or the
department employing the one police officer whose home was searched.

   Congress, in its first review of the
two-month-old savings and loan bailout, is scrutinizing ethics
rules written for the agency created to sell failed institutions.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., created Aug. 9 when President Bush
signed the bailout legislation, has gotten off to a fast start,
closing 24 small institutions of the 275 insolvent thrifts under
its control in 33 states.
   The agency is reviewing bids on five large institutions, all
with $1 billion or more in assets, and hopes to dispose of them by
the end of next week.
   But members of the Senate and House banking committees, meeting
Wednesday, will be probing to see if the fast start is creating
growing pains and whether the agency is establishing procedures to
prevent another HUD-type scandal.
   ``We want to be very sure there are safeguards in place against
any kind of special interest activity that would use the side door,
the back door, special relationships, etc.,'' said Sen. Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich. and the chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee.
   The RTC last week issued an interim ethics code governing the
thousands of independent contractors it is expected to hire to
manage the real estate and other assets it is inheriting from the
thrifts.
   David C. Cooke, the agency's executive director, said the RTC is
trying to prevent improprieties but at the same time avoid defining
conflict of interest so broadly that it is difficult to hire
advisers and property managers.
   ``It's difficult,'' Cooke said in a recent interview. ``Many of
the really big acknowledged experts have potential conflicts. We
need advice on how to sell real estate and the same contractors
that would provide us advice ... are probably advising somebody
else who may be interested in buying that real estate.''
   The code prohibits contractors from self-dealing, favortism and
conflicts of interest and sets up an agency board to rule on cases
that aren't black and white
   In another safeguard, the management of the RTC is split in a
unique arrangement designed to prevent abuse. Policies are
formulated by a Cabinet-level board headed by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady. But the actual operations are being carried out
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the independent agency
insuring bank and S&amp;L deposits, through a staff headed by Cooke.
   In the first few weeks of the RTC's existence, that structure
led to public squabbling between the FDIC and the adminstration
oversight board. Cooke said the tension was easing, but members of
Congress are still concerned.
   ``The one thing that's troubled me so far is the fighting
between (the FDIC) and the (oversight) board. ... Is that really
resolved permanently or is it just quiescent?'' said Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of a House task force appointed to
oversee the RTC.
   However, Cooke said, ``I think we're working that out. ... On
day one, there's a certain amount of tension because they may be
thinking one thing and we're thinking something entirely different.
Time is making that better.''
   In its first two months of existence, the RTC has spent $20
billion: $1.8 billion to close the 24 small S&amp;Ls; $8.3 billion to
handle the five large institutions and several other
not-yet-completed deals; $8.5 billion to replace high-cost
deposits; and $1.4 billion as a reserve fund to handle liquidity
problems at failed, but still open, thrifts, spokesman Steve
Katsanos said Tuesday.

<HEAD>Homeless Converging On Washington For Housing March</HEAD>

   Tens of thousands of people have begun
arriving in the capital to petition Congress and the Bush
administration to lift the homeless from the streets and make
housing more affordable for all Americans.
   Organizers remained coy Tuesday, as they have for months, about
the turnout they expect for three days of activities culminating in
a ``Housing Now!'' march Saturday on the national Mall.
   But the breadth of their sponsorship, coupled with a massive
planning effort dating to early in the year, could produce one of
the largest demonstrations Washington has seen in years.
   ``We're saying enough is enough,'' said Washington homeless
activist Mitch Snyder. ``Today the streets in Boston, New York and
Washington look like those in Calcutta. This demonstration is to
provide some will and some backbone to the administration and
Congress.''
   The march and related events, including a lobbying siege of
individual members of Congress by an estimated 4,000 people on
Thursday and Friday, is backed by more than 200 organizations,
including the AFL-CIO, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the YMCA, the
YWCA, the National Urban League, Catholic Charities USA, the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National
Organization for Women.
   More than 200 show business personalities and dozens of state
and local officials, including Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio and
Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, also have lent their support. The
Hollywood contingent is led by actress Valerie Harper and actor Jon
Voight.
   Snyder, head of the Community for Creative Non-Violence, and
Barry Zigas, president of the National Low-Income Housing
Coalition, are among the principal organizers of the march. At a
news conference Tuesday, Zigas repeatedly declined to predict a
turnout, other than to say ``It's going to be a major, major
event.'' He said more than half the participants would actually be
homeless people, some of whom were walking from New York City and
Roanoke, Va. Huge caravans were en route, meanwhile, from Los
Angeles, Chicago and other major cities along the way.
   ``Everybody who is not fabulously wealthy has reason to be
here,'' said Snyder, who in the past has waged hunger strikes to
draw attention to the plight of the homeless. ``We demand that
Congress put its hands back in its pockets and come up with the $25
billion it cut from the housing budget back in 1981.''
   Jack Joyce, head of the International Union of Bricklayers and
Allied Craftsmen, said ``There has been a paralysis of leadership
on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue on the housing problem. Housing
for the homeless is the most obvious of concerns ... but ordinary
people, working people, simply cannot afford housing today.''
   According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, there are an
estimated 3 million homeless people in the United States today.
Though that figure has been repeatedly cited as gospel by march
organizers and some members of Congress, it is widely disputed. The
liberal Urban Institute, for example, said in 1988 that the
homeless numbered no more than 600,000.
   Other estimates abound. A recent report by the American
Affordable Housing Institute at Rutgers University said ``the
number of persons likely to be homeless on a given night vary from
655,000 to 4 million,'' and it put the annual growth rate of
homelessness and anywhere between 20 percent and 40 percent.
   Activists complain that the Reagan-Bush administrations cut the
budget authority for federal housing assistance programs by 77
percent _ from $32 billion to less than $8 billion a year _ and
cite that as the principal reason for the growing numbers of people
who sleep in bus stations, abandoned cars, cardboard boxes or on
heat grates.
   But the Department of Housing and Urban Development says that
while budget authority _ the spending limit _ was lowered, actual
spending increased almost 150 percent since 1978. Still, HUD's own
figures indicate that at least 25 million Americans spend more than
half their income on housing. Currently, one in four eligible poor
renters actually receives federal help.
   Some conservatives, including former President Reagan, have
argued that many of the homeless are mentally disturbed people who
are on the streets, not for lack of government or private
resources, but because of recent court decisions which prohibit
them from being institutionalized against their will.
   But the Rutgers study says that ``Unlike the former stereotype
of the Bowery Bum or the lone drifter, today's homeless are,
substantially, functioning adults and families with children. They
are a cross-section of our poverty population.''
   According to the Child Welfare League of America, Inc., between
500,000 and 750,000 children in the United States are homeless.
   Though all participating organizations have vowed their
activities will be peaceful, one of the more militant groups, the
National Union of the Homeless, has threatened to ``evict'' HUD
officials from their offices on Friday unless restitution is made
to the housing budget by those responsible for the department's
mismanagement scandal. NUH leader Leona Smith declined to specify
exactly what the group has in mind.

<HEAD>Experts Urge Congress to Accelerate Fusion Energy Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leading experts on the potential for
harnessing the energy that makes the sun and stars shine told
Congress Tuesday the government should speed the pace of
experiments that could produce a breakthrough in the next decade.
   Harold P. Furth, director of the Princeton Plasma Physics
Laboratory, told a House panel that government leadership for the
magnetic fusion program was floundering just as scientists neared
the most important experimental stage in 40 years of work.
   ``At the moment, there is no schedule'' for beginning the next
key experiments, Furth told the House Science, Space and Technology
subcommittee on investigations.
   He said that while the United States has the wherewithal to be a
world leader in magnetic fusion research, ``we're suffering from
some kind of psychological block'' that prevents the nation from
making the necessary commitment.
   The United States has spent $5.5 billion in taxpayers' money
over the last four decades in pursuit of magnetic fusion energy _ a
self-sustaining reaction that releases energy when isotopes of
hydrogen are heated to temperatures hotter than the sun's core and
then fused. Magnetic fields are used to confine the isotopes.
   No one yet has proven the process to be commercially feasible,
but many believe it could be the major source of electricity
generation by the middle of the 21st century as the nation seeks to
lessen its dependence on fossil fuels.
   The next big step in fusion research, the experts told the House
Science, Space and Technology subcommittee on investigations, is
building a Compact Ignition Tokamak _ the world's first device
capable of producing a fusion reaction in which enough heat is
generated to sustain the reaction without further heating by the
machine.
   The Reagan administration had proposed that construction of the
Compact Ignition Tokamak start in 1992, but the Energy Department
in recent months has indicated it wants to spend less on the
machine and more on trying to determine beforehand whether it would
work. It has not set an official timetable for construction.
   Furth and other experts said building the $400 million machine
was vitally important to the program, even if the machine's success
could not be assured in advance.
   David O. Overskei, senior vice president of the fusion division
of General Atomics, told the panel that achieving a self-sustaining
magnetic fusion reaction was possible in the 1990s and ``will put
us on the threshold of fusion energy production.''

   Stressing that companies must help ``right the
ship of education,'' the National Alliance of Business released a
plan of action Tuesday to improve schools so students can be
prepared for the workforce.
   NAB President William Kolberg said the Corporate Action Agenda
is the first set of reports and action plans to be released since
President Bush met with the nation's governors last week in
Charlottesville, Va.
   The goal is to provide immediate and direct answers to business
people on how they must become involved now to initiate fundamental
educational change.
   Kolberg added that key members of the alliance ``will be
involved very much'' in helping to set the national performance
goals recommended by Bush and the governors at the summit.
   Alliance statistics showed that in 1950, only 57.4 percent of
American students graduated from high school, but those who failed
to graduate could still find jobs and lead productive lives. Today,
some 75 percent of the students graduate, but many are in no
position to absorb education and training beyond the high school
level.
   By 1995, it is estimated that some 14 million Americans will be
unprepared for the jobs available, the Alliance said.
   The Corporate Action Agenda _ endorsed by Education Secretary
Lauro Cavazos _ is comprised of four publications and a videotape.
   One of the publications, ``A Blueprint for Business on
Restructuring Education,'' outlines five major ways of using the
experience of business in restructuring America's schools:
school-based management, professionalism of teachers and
administrators, curriculum and instruction, accountability and
linking schools with social services.
   The action plans also provide in-depth information on new joint
ventures and partnerships between businesses and school system, and
details on establishing community-wide collaborative school-to-work
transition programs.
   ``It is clear the business community has a major role to play in
helping right the ship of education,'' said Kolberg, pointing to
the numerous years businesses have been involved in helping schools
with ``much of this effort focused on tinkering at the margin.''
   Kolberg said there are 140,800 education partnerships
nationwide, 57 percent sponsored by businesses or business
organizations. Yet few of the partnerships have effected
fundamental educational change, he said.
   ``Business must do more for our education system than simply
paying for our athletic uniforms, speaking in a classroom,
tutoring, offering plant tours or showing up for career days,''
said Kolberg.
   ``We are ready to work with others to make systemic changes in
the education system, both at the national, state and local
levels,'' he said.

   The Senate voted Tuesday to cut off debate on
long-stalled legislation that would require creation of a
commission to investigate the lengthy Eastern Airlines strike.
   Senators voted narrowly to invoke cloture, getting 61 votes,
just one more than necessary to limit debate. Thirty-six senators
voted against ending the filibuster by Senate Republicans.
   The Republicans had been backing President Bush's refusal to
appoint an emergency board, under provisions of the Railway Labor
Act, to probe the strike, led by machinists, which began March 4.
   The action breaks a parliamentary jam holding up consideration
of a measure mandating establishment of a three-person commission
to study the work stoppage and make recommendations for its
solution.
   There was no immediate indication when the Senate would proceed
to a vote on the bill. Under cloture rules, no senator may talk for
more than an hour after debate has been cut off. This usually means
there would be no more than 30 to 40 hours of further debate, since
it takes 60 senators in the 100-member chamber to invoke cloture.
   Democrats had said last week that if they were successful in
achieving a cutoff of debate, they would then substitute
union-backed language for the House-passed bill, creating a
commission with one member each appointed by Bush, Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash.
   ``I think, in fairness, we should invoke cloture,'' Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, told colleagues before Tuesday's vote. ``I
believe that we owe nothing less to the workers of Eastern
Airlines.''
   Since March, Republican members of the Senate have used delaying
tactics to block the chamber's consideration of House-passed
legislation requiring Bush to appoint an emergency board. The
president has refused to create a board, saying management and
employees should resolve the problem.
   But Metzenbaum said it was time to force Bush's hand.
   ``It is now obvious that the president will not appoint an
emergency board,'' he said. ``It is now obvious that unless
Congress takes action, the president is content to do nothing ...
while the families of 30,000 Eastern workers suffer.''
   Five days after the machinists struck Eastern, joined by pilots
and flight attendants, the carrier filed for protection under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Act. Eastern has been continuing efforts to
reorganize in bankruptcy court and the airline has said it plans to
emerge as a carrier two-thirds its former size.

   The House, bogged down with other legislation,
postponed for one day, until Wednesday, its likely vote to repeal
catastrophic health insurance for the nation's elderly.
   Proponents of the program, enacted a year ago in a rush of
bipartisan fervor, acknowledged Tuesday that the best they could
hope for was to salvage a sliver of the new benefits, which marked
the first major expansion of Medicare in two decades.
   Since the program began, legislators have been buffeted by
criticism from elderly Americans upset about the cost of the
insurance.
   The chamber had been expected to vote on repealing the program
Tuesday, but scheduled debate on other legislation took so long
that the vote was put off until Wednesday.
   Even if the House votes to repeal the program, its fate won't be
known until later in the fall, after negotiations with the Senate,
which is expected to deal with the matter on its own later this
week.
   At stake were significant new hospital and doctor-bill benefits
for 33 million elderly and disabled Americans covered by Medicare.
Many of the benefits do not take effect until January.
   The cry for repeal came from three quarters:
   _Retirees who complained their former employers were already
giving them additional benefits they were being forced to purchase
from Medicare.
   _Upper income retirees who objected to having to pay a
disproportionate share of the costs _ in the form of an income tax
surcharge _ to make up for a more modest assessment on the
estimated 56 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who don't have
enough money to owe any income taxes.
   _Those who complained that the program did not address the main
need of elderly Americans: insurance for nursing home and other
long-term care, a benefit that many studies have said would be as
much as 10 times as costly.
   Ironically, House leaders said legislators' painful experience
with this run at a major expansion of acute care health protection
probably would make them less inclined to pursue even more costly
programs for the elderly in the future.
   ``Future programs are going to have to be more carefully
considered,'' House Speaker Thomas S. Foley told reporters shortly
before debate was to have begun on the proposal to repeal
catastrophic health insurance.
   Earlier, Foley had described a ``mood of frustration'' as
settling over House health policy leaders.
   Indeed, Rep. Fortney Stark, D-Calif., a major force behind the
catastrophic program, said Monday that ``I think they (lawmakers)
feel they'd just like to get rid of this annoyance and they
certainly are going to be very skeptical when I come to them in the
future with a bill to help the senior citizens.''
   Stark said catastrophic care supporters ``lost the information
battle'' to groups that preyed on the fears of the elderly.
   ``It's very easy to take very fragile, very insecure seniors who
are easily confused and confuse them even further,'' he said.
   The income tax surcharge ranges up to $800 this year for
Medicare-eligible people in upper income ranges. The Congressional
Budget Office said about 6 percent of the 33 million people covered
would be hit with the maximum.
   Most of the 15 million or so Americans who would be subject to
the surcharge at all would pay much less _ $15 per $150 of tax
liability this year. The additional cost for the majority of those
covered by Medicare: $4 per month. Both the flat monthly premium
and the surtax, officially called a ``supplemental premium'' would
increase in future years.
   Whoever won the ``information battle'' mentioned by Stark, there
was no question that House members were inundated with mail urging
them to repeal the program and almost none urging them to keep it.
   Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., illustrated that in a brief speech
explaining his intention to vote for repeal even before formal
debate began. He said he had received 2,172 letters urging repeal
and one supporting the program.
   Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., said his office received 3,807 letters
urging repeal.
   The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act was aimed at protecting
the elderly and disabled from financial ruin in the event of a
prolonged hospital stay or other high medical costs.
   The program pays for unlimited approved hospitalization after a
once-a-year deductible of $560 in 1989. Previously, Medicare
charged a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and
provided full payment of hospital bills only up to 59 days a year.
   The plan also would limit, starting Jan. 1, the amount that
beneficiaries must pay for hospital care, physician services,
medical supplies and prescription drugs and would expand other
health care benefits as well.

<HEAD>Doctors Find First Western U.S. Case of Type 2 AIDS Virus Infection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first western United States case of a
rare type of AIDS infection was diagnosed in a man who had sex with
20 to 40 women here since 1979, but the risk to his lovers is
fairly low, doctors said Tuesday.
   The man, who hasn't developed AIDS, ``is definitely the first
case I know of on the West Coast'' of infection by HIV-2, a
relative of the AIDS virus which is rare in this country compared
with the main AIDS virus, HIV-1, said Dr. Thomas O'Brien, an
epidemiologist at the national Centers for Disease Control.
   Until now, only seven cases of HIV-2 infection had been
confirmed in the United States _ three in Massachusetts and one
each in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Florida and New Jersey _ and
three of the patients developed AIDS symptoms, O'Brien said by
phone from Atlanta.
   Almost all the patients imported the virus from West Africa,
where HIV-2 is endemic.
   Of the West Coast man's lovers, ``We've identified one
individual with whom he had multiple unprotected sexual contacts
over a long period of time, and that person has been tested and is
not infected with this virus. That is reassuring,'' said Dr. Peter
Kerndt, Los Angeles County's director of AIDS epidemiology.
   A second lover also is uninfected, but officials expect to
locate only two or three more of the 20 to 40 women with whom the
man had sex since he moved here in 1979 from the West African
nation of Sierra Leone, Kerndt said.
   The infected Los Angeles resident is in his 30s, works full-time
and attends school part-time. Officials withheld his identity. He
has refrained from sex since learning three months ago he might be
infected with HIV-2, said Dr. David Ho, AIDS virology laboratory
director at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   ``This man is a pretty decent person,'' Ho said. ``He's had a
couple of traceable contacts and they are negative (AIDS-free). But
he had multiple other non-traceable contacts _ one-night stands.
He's fully cooperative, but he doesn't know these other women he
had casual sex with.''
   A private doctor referred the man to Cedars-Sinai for AIDS
testing, but he wasn't hospitalized, Ho said.
   HIV-2, or human immunodeficiency virus type 2, was first
described in 1985 in West African prostitutes who had no symptoms,
then was reported in 1986 in two West Africans who suffered AIDS,
O'Brien said.
   HIV-1 and HIV-2 both can cripple the body's ability to fight
disease, leading to fatal infections and cancers.
   ``The question that remains is whether it (HIV-2) can lead to
immunodeficiency as quickly or as often as HIV-1,'' which has
caused AIDS in more than 105,000 Americans, killing some 61,000 of
them, O'Brien said.
   The infected Los Angeles man has very low levels of HIV-2 in his
blood, so ``the risk of transmission in casual sexual contacts is
very low,'' Kerndt said.
   He said the man may have been infected before coming to the
country in 1979 or during a visit home in 1983.
   Kerndt said the infected man never donated blood, ``has not used
drugs intravenously, nor has he engaged in any homosexual
activity.''
   So far, the risk to the blood supply is considered low because
blood bank guidelines prohibit blood donations by West Africans,
and because the test used to detect blood infected with HIV-1 can
detect 85 percent to 90 percent of samples of blood infected with
HIV-2, Kerndt said.
   HIV-2 and HIV-1 are equally common in the Ivory Coast, and HIV-2
may be more common in Guinea Bissau and perhaps Senegal, O'Brien
said, adding that HIV-2 infection also has been reported in Europe,
South America and other parts of Africa.

   Panamanian troops loyal to Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega recaptured military headquarters from rebel
soldiers today after a six-hour battle and officials in Washington
and Panama City agreed the coup was crushed.
   The rebels failed to capture Noriega in the coup attempt,
according to the reports.
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
the coup appeared to have failed.
   The rebel troops claimed that they seized and held the Defense
Forces headquarters in downtown Panama City. Troops loyal to
Noriega climbed the roofs of surrounding buildings, throwing hand
grenades, firing mortars and sniping at targets inside the compound.
   Noriega has defied U.S. efforts to oust him for two years and
survived a coup attempt in March 1988. He has been indicted on drug
charges in the United States, which accuses him of having ties to
Colombia drug traffickers.
   The coup announcement was read over national radio at about
11:30 a.m. It said the entire high command was forced into
retirement by middle-ranking officers led by Maj. Moises Giraldi
Vega, head of the Urraca battalion in charge of security at Defense
Forces headquarters.
   The communique was signed by Giraldi, Capt. Javier Licona of the
cavalry and Capt. Jesus George Balma of the special forces.
   ``This is strictly a military movement. There is no politics
involved,'' the communique said, referring to the civilian
opposition that has been trying to topple Noriega with U.S. help.
   The communique did not say whether any members of the high
command were in custody.
   An hour later a man who identified himself as Lt. Col. Arnulfo
Castrejon made a television broadcast saying that forces loyal to
Noriega ``were ready to give their lives to defend Gen. Noriega.
This is a betrayal.''
   However, nobody was visible on the screen as the broadcast was
made. The camera showed only a clock on a wall.
   The communique said Noriega and six top colonels were being
``retired'' because they had been on active service for more than
25 years and exceeded the deadline for mandatory retirement.
   Jose Blandon, a Panamanian defector and former close aide to
Noriega, said in Washington that he had spoken by telephone with
Balma, one of the leaders of the coup, who told him that Noriega
had been wounded and was in custody.
   He said officers intended to send Noriega to the United States
to face drug charges, but that it would be difficult to do so
because other officers in the defense forces also were involved in
the drug trade.
   Blandon said the coup had been timed for a moment when many
troops loyal to Noriega were outside of Panama participating in an
island training exercise.
   At the United Nations, Panama's provisional president accused
the United States of undermining his nation with ``financial
terrorism, economic blackmail and political interference.''
   ``The government today has had to control a new attempt at
subversion, frustrated by the will of our people and our armed
forces,'' President Francisco Rodriguez told the General Assembly.
   President Bush denied that the United States was involved in the
operation.
   ``Nobody's sure what's happening there,'' the president told
reporters at the White House. ``There were rumors around that this
was some American operation and I can tell you that is not true.''
   But Bush, implying his endorsement to oust Noriega, added: ``We
have no argument with the Panamanian Defense Forces. We have no
argument with them.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he was unable to
confirm that Noriega had been ousted. He said the United States had
advance word of the uprising.
   One U.S. administration official said the White House was not
convinced Noriega had been toppled, although that was possible.
   ``We've got conflicting reports,'' the official said, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``There have been conflicting reports
about how successful it's been.''
   In Washington, former Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, an
anti-Noriega activist, said before the radio announcement that the
shooting was part of a coup attempt carried out by dissidents
within the Defense Forces.
   Sosa said there has been discontent among some officers who were
passed over in recent promotions and who were dissatisfied for
other reasons.
   ``It's been building over the past few days,'' he said.
   There was no confirmation of casualties, but neighbors of the
headquarters in Panama City told The Associated Press there were
dead and wounded.
   The U.S. Southern Command put its troops and civilians on Delta
Alert, its highest level of readiness.
   U.S. troops in combat gear took up positions only 600 yards from
the barracks, which is in downtown Panama City near the canal. The
U.S. Southern Command has installations at Fort Amador and Quarry
Heights, less than a mile from the barracks. The Pentagon said no
U.S. troops were involved in shooting.
   A U.S. military jet and helicopter gunships were seen in the
area, but apparently were only observing the action and did not
participate.
   Shooting began with a few bursts of fire shortly around 7 a.m.
(8 a.m. EDT) and was continuing more than three hours later.
   Neighbors, who insisted on not being identified, said they heard
small arms being fired and bursts of automatic weapons.
   Neighbors and reporters saw three ambulances leave the
headquarters compound.
   Journalists were kept more than 100 yards away by police, backed
by Panamanian armored personnel carriers and water-cannon trucks.
Vehicle traffic to the headquarters compound was also blocked by
the military.
   Armed men in civilian clothes surrounded the Department of
National Investigations, Panama's political police, located about
500 yards from the headquarters.
   In Washington, the Pentagon said gunfire had been heard by
forces at the Southern Command and Americans were told to avoid
dangerous areas.
   There are about 12,000 U.S. troops stationed in Panama, many of
them within five miles of Panama City. All U.S. civilian dependents
were moved onto U.S. military installations as of July 1 in the
wake of violence that followed Panamanian elections held on May 7.
   Noriega, Panama's de facto leader, assumed command of the
military in 1983. The United States has been trying to oust Noriega
since he was indicted on U.S. drug charges in February 1988.
Noriega says the drug charges are part of a U.S. plot to abrogate
the Panama Canal treaties and retain control of the canal at the
end of the century.
   U.S. efforts to oust Noriega have focused on encouraging the
civilian opposition and on attempting to undercut his support in
the military, encouraging members of the Defense Forces to ask him
to leave or oust him by force.
   Efforts by the United States to remove him, including economic
sanctions against Panama, have failed.

<HEAD>Court Hears Arguments on Exclusion of Evidence in Illinois Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Police misconduct is likely to increase if the
Supreme Court creates a new loophole in the rule barring unlawfully
obtained evidence from criminal trials, a Chicago lawyer warned
Tuesday.
   ``Expansion of the use of unlawfully obtained evidence ... is a
major step the court should not take at this time,'' said Martin
Carlson, arguing in behalf of a young convicted murderer before the
Supreme Court. ``It would add significant incentive to police'' to
violate protected rights, he contended.
   But Terence Madsen, an assistant attorney general for Illinois,
said the justices would enhance the ``truth-seeking process'' of
criminal trials nationwide if allowing such an expansion.
   The state's arguments are supported in a ``friend-of-the-court''
brief submitted by the Bush administration.
   At issue in the case, to be decided by July, is whether
statements a criminal defendant makes after an unlawful arrest may
be used by prosecutors to contradict a defense witness' trial
testimony.
   The so-called ``exclusionary rule,'' created by the Supreme
Court nearly 75 years ago, generally prohibits the use at trial of
any illegally obtained evidence.
   The high court later carved out an exception to the rule by
allowing prosecutors to use such evidence to contradict a
defendant's own trial testimony. But the justices never have said
such evidence may be used to rebut or discredit other witnesses'
testimony.
   The Illinois Supreme Court, by a 4-3 vote, allowed such evidence
to be introduced at the trial of Darryl James, sentenced to 30
years in prison for a 1982 murder.
   James was 15 when arrested in his mother's beauty parlor for a
pair of Aug. 30, 1982 shootings. He was tried as an adult.
   Prosecutors said James shot and killed Geliria Boyd and wounded
another youth in a late-night confrontation on a south Chicago
street.
   Several prosecution witnesses identified James as the
triggerman, and testified that on the night of the crime he had
long, reddish-brown hair.
   At his trial, James had short, black hair.
   James did not testify but two defense witnesses testified in his
behalf. One said that James had short, black hair the night of the
shootings.
   Prosecutors then won the judge's permission to let a police
detective testify that James, when arrested, said he had long,
reddish-brown hair the night of the crime and that he had his hair
dyed and cut at his mother's shop.
   The trial judge previously had disallowed such testimony, ruling
that James' arrest was unlawful because police at the time did not
have a court warrant or probable cause to suspect him of committing
a crime.
   Madsen, the state's lawyer, was questioned rigorously by Justice
John Paul Stevens, the court's only Illinois native.
   If unlawfully obtained evidence can be used by prosecutors any
time a defendant mounts any kind of defense, Stevens suggested,
``police would have every incentive'' to bend the rules.
   ``Police departments around the country would alter their
procedures'' to make sure such evidence is obtained, Stevens said.
   But Madsen disagreed, saying, ``It's not correct to presume that
the police would not do it right.''
   The case is James vs. Illinois, 88-6075.

   A member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee said Tuesday he was outraged to find Marine recruits at
Parris Island, S.C., using the slogan ``kill, rape, pillage, burn''
during basic training.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a heavily decorated retired Navy
captain and ex-prisoner of war, said, ``The Marines ought to be
ashamed.'' He has asked the commandant of the corps to investigate.
   McCain's reaction stemmed from a photograph sent to him by the
parents of a man who graduated in August from the Marine Corps
Recruit Depot at Parris Island.
   The 8x10 color photograph was a formal platoon graduation
picture showing the recruits standing at attention on risers with
the officers who trained them n the foreground.
   Eight of the men held four hand-painted signs bearing pictures
and slogans, which one of the recruits said were used as signs for
the men to march behind during training.
   One showed a naked woman. Another had a skull and crossbones
with the words ``kill, rape, pillage, burn.''
   ``I was in the service 22 years and never saw anything like
this,'' McCain, who was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for 5{
years, said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   ``It's outrageous,'' he said.
   Capt. J.R. Mill, public affairs officer at Parris Island, said
the signs ``were done in bad taste which represents neither the
policy nor the philosophy of this command or the United States
Marine Corps and we are taking corrective action concerning this
situation.''
   Mill said that the sign was made under the supervision and
approval of a drill instructor, but that ``this is not a normal
occurrence and I would consider this isolated incident.''
   McCain said the blame lay with the officers.
   ``It shows a lack of supervision,'' he said. ``We are paying
those officers with taxpayers' dollars. We want them to be
honorable fighting men.''
   The senator, in a letter sent Monday to the Marine commandant,
Gen. Alfred Gray, said, the signs ``violate the values which
Americans expect their Marines to carry with them in defense of the
nation.''
   ``While platoon mottoes are important to motivation and morale
in the boot camp environment, the high standards of the Marine
Corps demands a philosophy, a set of values, a dedication and a
resolve with which the enclosed photograph is simply
incompatible,'' McCain wrote.
   He asked Gray to look into the incident and ensure that the
commanders of the the platoon in the photograph ``understand and
embrace proper Marine Corps values.''
   McCain also asked Gray to make sure that the recruits in the
photograph were contacted and ``that they understand why this type
of conduct is inconsistent with the Marine Corps' values and
tradition.''

   The Communists decided Tuesday to hold a
congress in January, which could be their last because a poll of
members indicates 72 percent want the party completely reorganized
and given a new name.
   The Eleventh Party Congress was scheduled for Jan. 27 by a
resolution accepted at a one-day meeting of the Central Committee.
The committee also called for congress delegates to be elected
under new democratic rules.
   The party, officially called the Polish United Workers Party,
was established in its current form in 1948.
   After crushing election losses this year, party leaders seem
determined to rename the party and create a broader leftist
political organization that would include socialists and social
democrats.
   ``People from under different shades of the red banner'' should
be able to ``find their place in it,'' party Secretary Leszek
Miller told the committee Tuesday. The party should become ``open
to reality and to the challenges that the future brings,'' he said.
   Tomasz Nalec, who represents a reformist club within the party,
said the full party meeting should be considered ``the founding
congress of a new party of democratic socialism.''
   Seventy-two percent of party members polled over the past month
favor changing the party's name, charter and program, according to
partial results announced at the plenum's opening. The survey
involved more than 1.1 million of the 2.1 million party members.
   Officials of the party, seeking to recast its identity since
overwhelming losses to Solidarity in June's first-ever democratic
parliamentary elections, say it must change to survive.
   Politburo member Marian Orzechowski has said the party should
rename itself the Polish Socialist Party of the Working People.
   The key changes are to be made at the congress, expected to be
made up of 1,000 to 2,000 elected delegates under the leadership of
First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski.
   A communist official who briefed reporters before the plenum on
condition of anonymity also said another shakeup in the party's
ruling Politburo was expected. It would be the second since July.
   Miller, discussing preparations for the congress at the plenum,
said the party planned open, competitive election campaigns for
congress delegates in order to get the public interested in the
party's affairs.
   The party is inviting society to ``create the party with us,''
he said, and the party must strive to find an identity which will
give it a popular base.
   ``The question is whether the Polish United Workers Party can
fulfill the aspirations of the part of Polish society which is
left-leaning,'' he said.
   The pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reported Tuesday
that the draft plenum's resolution favored a multi-sector economy
dominated by development of the state-run economy. The draft
opposed privatizing and selling off state enterprises, a chief
economic goal of the Solidarity-led government, the newspaper said.
   The draft also ``obliges all party cells to create conditions
for free expression of different views,'' the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Historian Sees `Community of Interest' in War Coverage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``community of interest'' between
government and the news media often limits war coverage, a
historian who has studied Vietnam War reporting told newspaper
editors Tuesday.
   Military historian William Hammond has stirred controversy with
his book ``The Military and the Media'' by contending that,
overall, news accounts of the Vietnam War gave a better picture of
that conflict than did official reports.
   But he says the news media passed over some major stories.
   ``The media is much less an outsider from the government than,
perhaps, it might think,'' Hammond told the annual convention of
the Associated Press Managing Editors. ``There's a tremendous
interplay between the government and the media. Not only do
individuals constantly go from the media into government, or from
the government into media ... but there is a community of interest
here.''
   Hammond, a historian at the Army Center of Military History in
Washington, said reporters operated with self-imposed limitations
in reporting the Vietnam War, to avoid burning bridges with
military authorities.
   ``He's going to have to be back over there again dealing with
them to get some more news,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, Hammond said, news accounts sometimes informed
senior military commanders of what actually was happening in the
war.
   ``Sometimes the commander high up the chain of command is the
last one to find out anything,'' he said.
   News coverage often prompted a change in tactics that benefited
the war effort, he said.
   ``In this case, media coverage actually extended the vision of
the commander, and he was able to make a response that was very
important to the overall goal of the American military in Vietnam.''
   But major stories that would have bruised the Army's image went
largely unreported, including the persistent problems of the M-16,
the primary infantry weapon used in the war, he said.
   Far from assisting in the war, that lack of reporting may have
damaged the military effort because there was no call for changes
to the M-16, Hammond said.
   ``The press in Vietnam did not pick up the story with any
consistency,'' he said. ``What happened? The military never had any
kind of a prod to do much about repairing the weapon.''
   The APME comprises news executives of the member newspapers of
The Associated Press, the newsgathering cooperative.

   A dancer who claimed she was actor William
Hurt's common-law wife and entitled to half his money could not
consider their relationship a marriage because living together is
not the same thing, a judge ruled Tuesday.
   State Supreme Court Justice Jacqueline Silbermann ruled that
although Sandra Jennings lived with Hurt and had a child with him,
a marriage did not exist, even during the time they were in South
Carolina, which recognizes common-law marriage.
   ``Absent proof of a mutual agreement to be married, an agreement
to marry cannot be inferred from the fact that the parties were
living together,'' Silbermann wrote. ``The contrary is true.''
   She also said the relationship was illicit when it began because
Hurt was married, and did not become legitimate simply because he
got divorced.
   The 14-page decision did not deal with financial support for
Jennings and the couple's 6-year-old son, Alexander Devon Hurt.
Hurt currently pays $60,000 to $65,000 a year to Jennings and the
boy. Before the trial, he refused to increase the amount and
Jennings petitioned for $16,000 a month, which Silbermann rejected.
   ``I am thankful for the ruling received today, which is a
vindication of everything I have said.'' Hurt said in a statement
issued by his publicist.
   ``I felt that I simply could not continually give in to the
pressures that have been constantly put on me for more and more
money and other accommodations from Sandra Jennings and others,''
the statement said.
   Jennings' lawyer said he would appeal the ruling because he felt
the judge was ``madly in love'' with Hurt.
   ``Let five judges who are all men decide this, not one woman who
is impressed by a movie star,'' A. Richard Golub said. In New York,
the State Supreme Court is a trial-level court.
   Silbermann is ``so madly in love with this defendant, Bill Hurt,
that we never could have gotten a fair shake. All her rulings came
down that way. If we had won, I would have been shocked,'' he said.
   Jennings met Hurt in Saratoga, N.Y., in the summer of 1981 when
he was 31 and a rising star and she was a 24-year-old ballerina
with the New York City ballet. Although she knew he was still
married to actress Mary Beth Hurt, Jennings began living with Hurt.
They had a child less than a year later.
   Jennings based her lawsuit on four of the 10 weeks she spent
with Hurt in Beaufort, S.C., during the winter of 1982-83 while he
was there filming ``The Big Chill.''
   Some of Hurt's other movies include ``Body Heat,'' ``Children of
a Lesser God,'' ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' ``Broadcast News''
and ``The Accidental Tourist.'' He won an Oscar in 1986 for
``Spider Woman.''

   Many of the reforms Jack Kemp proposed Tuesday
for the Department of Housing and Urban Development were suggested
to Congress more than five years ago by the General Accounting
Office, but fell on deaf ears.
   Lawmakers are listening now.
   Report after report of scandal and mismanagement at the
department during the Reagan administration have made HUD big news,
creating an impetus for reform and giving new housing secretary
Kemp a high-profile platform from which to promote his housing
initiatives.
   Still, the Democratic-controlled Congress is unlikely to accept
all of Kemp's ideas and almost certain to use tales of huge fees
paid to Republican consultants to try to pressure Kemp and the Bush
administration to back up their outrage over the scandals with more
money to house the victims of the mismanagement.
   Kemp was quick Tuesday to credit Congress for many of his
recommendations and hail the bipartisan spirit with which lawmakers
have been investigating past abuses. He was equally quick to assess
the political impact of the problems, believed to have cost the
government more than $6 billion.
   ``This problem has turned out to be, I believe, and will turn
out to be, a blessing in disguise because it's giving us an
opportunity to get back on the right track,'' Kemp told reporters.
   There's no disagreement on that point, but there are myriad
views on just what ``the right track'' should be.
   For example, Kemp proposed eliminating the Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation Program. Many in Congress support the program and
were successful in fighting back repeated efforts by Reagan to kill
it.
   This year has brought reports of widespread influence peddling
in the program, allowing millions of dollars to be steered to
former HUD officials and developers who hired GOP constultants.
   But many prominent Democrats still believe that the program is
the best way to rehabilitate housing for low-income families and
the elderly and think that restrictions on lobbying and a
competitive financing process would end the abuses. Many of those
same Democrats also suspect the administration will use the
scandals to shrink or eliminate other HUD programs Congress favors.
   ``It's extremely important we do not allow the scandal during
the previous administration, the mismanagement, the lost billions,
to drive us into giving up the goal, which is to provide
affordable, safe, healthy, reasonable housing for tens of millions
of American families,'' said Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., and the
chairman of the House subcommittee investigating HUD.
   Ideological fights over housing programs will no doubt continue
and probably will block any major redirection of housing policy in
the short term.
   But the scandals _ Kemp's ``blessing in disguise'' _ and his
involving Congress in the drafting of his reform package likely
will prevent fights over the management aspects of Kemp's plan so
big that they must be settled in Congress.
   ``You can't let ideology get in the way when you have an
opportunity like this,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., a
member of the Lantos subcommitee. ``People are paying a lot of
attention to this now and there's a lot of momentum I sure don't
want to lose.''

<HEAD>House Passes Old-Growth Forest Compromise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved legislation Tuesday that
will allow continuned logging of the old-growth forests in the
Pacific Northwest while at the same time imposing protections for
the spotted owl.
   The legislation was part of the Interior appropriations bill for
the fiscal year that began Sunday, which was approved by the House
on a 381-41 vote. Final approval by the Senate is expected this
week.
   The action came over the objections of Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore.,
who said Congress was caving into the demands of ``radical''
environmentalists and the legislation would result in a
``substantial and grevious reduction'' in timber harvest.
   ``This is beyond compromise; this is surrender,'' said Smith.
   Smith said the legislation would do little to end the litigation
that has tied up timber sales in the region's federal forests and
would cost thousands of jobs.
   But in a series of heated exchanges with Smith, Democratic Reps.
Les AuCoin of Oregon and Norm Dicks of Washington state defended
the compromise legislation.
   ``I regret my colleague from Oregon finds fault with this
compromise,'' said AuCoin. ``I find fault. But you can't sit on a
porch ... and call it surrender.''
   AuCoin said the legislation would save roughly 11,000 jobs in
the Northwest threatened by current court injunctions barring
logging in old-growth forests which provide prime nesting habitat
for the owl.
   ``I understand the gentleman's frustration,'' said Dicks. ``But
sometimes in the political process you have to deal with what is
practical and doable.''
   Dicks and AuCoin said that more than 100 House members had
expressed opposition to a Senate-passed timber plan which would
have drastically curbed the power of the federal courts to halt
timber sales and had vowed to oppose any effort to pass it in the
House. Smith had supported the Senate plan.
   ``I supported the Senate amendment too, but it wasn't going to
pass,'' said AuCoin. ``It's better to save 11,000 jobs then get
mowed down in a ball of flame.''
   But Smith wasn't about to back down.
   ``I always thought a majority around here was 218 (votes) and
not 100,'' said Smith. ``Radical environmentalists have
percipitated a three-ring circus in the forests, the Congress and
the courts.''
   The compromise legislation, which has the reluctant support of
many industry and environmental groups, will allow 9.6 billion
board feet of timber to be sold in the region's federal forest
during the new fiscal year.
   It also imposes strict deadlines on the corts for resolving
appeals of individual timber sales, requires that about half the
sales currently enjoined be released and requires that federal
agencies ``minimize fragmentation of environmentally significant
old-growth forest stands.''
   The Fish and Wildlife Service is trying to decide whether to
list the northern spotted owl as a threatened species. Such a
listing would require federal agencies, including the major
timber-selling agencies, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management, to avoid actions that would destroy habitat.
   Biologists say the owl lives almost exclusively in the
old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, with each nesting pair
requiring a large amount of undisturbed forest.

<HEAD>U.N. Official Demands Namibia Police Unit Disband</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An official of the U.N. monitoring
force said Tuesday the demobilization of a controversial police
unit over the weekend was not conducted properly and must be done
again.
   Fred Eckhard, chief spokesman for the multinational force, said
procedures used by territorial police to demobilize the former
Koevoet counterinsurgency unit Saturday were ``not at all
satisfactory.''
   Eckhard said only 900 of Koevoet's estimated 1,200 former
members showed up for the demobilization at a northern police base,
and no steps were taken to identify them or ascertain the
whereabouts of their weapons.
   Since arriving in April to monitor Namibia's transition to
independence, U.N. officials have sought to deactivate all police
who served with Koevoet _ which means crowbar in Afrikaans _ during
a 23-year war between South African-led security forces and
pro-independence guerrillas.
   The unit, made up of black Namibians commanded by white
officers, was accused of atrocities during the war and of harassing
guerrilla supporters since April, when its members were integrated
into the regular police force.
   Gerhard Roux, spokesman for the territorial administrator
installed by South Africa, Louis Pienaar, said police would try to
trace the remaining 300 ex-Koevoet members and serve them with
demobilization papers. He said there would be no further
demobilization ceremonies, and added that the unit's weapons were
stored securely at Okave police base.
   U.N.-supervised elections are scheduled for Nov. 7-11 to elect
an assembly to draft a constitution for an independent Namibia. The
South-West Africa People's Organization, which waged the guerrilla
war, is favored to get the most votes but needs a two-thirds
majority to have full control of the assembly.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I, in violation
of U.N. resolutions since 1966. Last year, it agreed last year to
grant independence as part of a regional treaty that also included
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor.

   A University of Mississippi committee
Tuesday recommended probation for nine students in a fraternity
prank that stranded two students naked and painted with racial
slurs at a mostly black college.
   The disciplinary committee recommended that the university's
chancellor expel a 10th student and suspend four others.
   Most of the students were pledges to the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity Sept. 18, when two members of the fraternity's Ole Miss
chapter were carried by car to Rust College, a small, private
school 25 miles to the north. They were stripped naked, their hands
and feet bound with duct tape and their bodies painted with such
things as ``KKK'' and ``We hate niggers.''
   The two, who are white, were picked up by Rust security
officers. The students facing disciplinary action also are white.
   Ole Miss Chancellor Gerald Turner last week banned Beta Theta Pi
from the school for three years and ordered the fraternity house
closed.
   Turner has final say on discipline against the students, whose
names were not released. The students have until Friday to appeal.
Turner will take no disciplinary action before Friday, a university
spokesman said.
   Turner said last week the incident had opened an old wound at
Ole Miss., the scene of violence in 1962 when James Meredith
enrolled as its first black student.
   Fraternity members have remained silent about the incident.

<HEAD>Official Says US Sanctions Promote Changes in South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top State Department official said Tuesday
that sanctions against South Africa, which the Reagan
administration had opposed had ``played a role'' in moderating the
apartheid policies of that nation's government.
   The official also left open the possibility of further U.S.
economic sanctions against the white-ruled government, an option
the Reagan administration refused even to consider.
   ``Sanctions have played a role in stimulating new thinking
within the white power structure,'' said Herman J. Cohen, assistant
secretary of State for Aftican affairs, in an admission never made
by officials of the previous administration.
   ``It is now increasingly clear to that government that the well
being of the white minority cannot be sustained without a
negotiated political settlement that results in political equality
for all South Africans,'' Cohen said.
   ``I cannot imagine your predecessor (in the Reagan
administration) making that statement,'' said Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcomittee on
Africa, applauding the formulation as `` a shift in position.''
   Cohen said that while he wouldn't characterize the Bush
administration's position as a change, the White House does
recognize that without positive steps to dismantle South Africa's
system of racial apartheid, ``pressures will build for more
sanctions.''
   It becomes clear, he said, ``that we cannot wait indefinitely.''
   However, Cohen discouraged calls for stiffer measures, saying
the administration by far prefers a course of negotiations, not
punitive sanctions.
   Cohen's testimony coincided with the State Department's release
of a congressionally mandated report to determine the impact of
sanctions imposed by the United States in 1986 and to evaluate
whether additional measures are necessary.
   While asserting that the 1986 sanctions have not succeeded in
abolishing apartheid, the report said ``there is some reason for
hope that the opportunity for a peaceful end to apartheid has not
yet been lost.''
   The study said ``further sanctions are not needed at this time
and would be counterproductive in view of steps being taken within
South Africa and the region to bring about change through peaceful
means.''
   The report concluded additional sanctions mandated by Congress
``have not to date been successful in moving the South African
government toward the goals ... that are shared by the
administration and Congress.''
   Cohen said the administration is committed to effectively
enforcing the existing sanctions ``in the hope and expectation that
positive signs of a commitment to change will appear in the near
future.''
   Cohen's appearance represented the first administration
testimony on South Africa since the inauguration of the government
of President F. W. de Klerk who campaigned for the office on a
moderate platform.
   ``For the first time in years it is possible to be somewhat
hopeful that a negotiation scenario may be just beyond the
horizon,'' Cohen said, adding that South Africa appears to be
entering a period of ``talking about talks.''
   External and internal pressures are helping convince the South
African government that it must ``move beyond its current position
and accept fundamental change,'' he said.
   ``In fact, the new de Klerk government has indicated it is
prepared to take concrete steps to address this need.''
   ``For this reason, the administration recommends that no new
sanctions be considered at the present time,'' he said.
   During the Reagan administration the Democratic majority in
Congress engaged in fierce battles with the White House over South
African policy, battles which resulted in the passage of
comprehensive economic sanctions in 1986.
   Cohen said that South Africa was quickly identified by Secretary
of State James A. Baker III ``as an area where the breakdown of
bipartisan support undercut the ability of the United States to
encourage a peaceful transition to democracy.''
   ``We want to be able to send a a clear signal of broad,
bipartisan support for a policy premised on unequivocal abhorrence
of apartheid, reflected in a sustained U.S. commitment to promoting
negotiations btween the government of in Pretoria and legitimate
black representatives leading to a non-racial and democratic South
Africa,'' Cohen said.
   Another witness, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., complained,
however, that the Bush administration is engaged in ``unacceptable
foot dragging'' on South Africa.
   ``We should make clear we are prepared to impose additional U.S
. sanctions against South Africa, if there is no progress,''
Kennedy said, suggesting that leverage might be found in
negotiations set for next year to restructured $9 billion in South
African debt to U.S. banks.

   A group demanding the release of a
Palestinian wanted on terrorism charges in the United States
occupied the Justice Ministry for eight hours Tuesday.
   About 20 members of the Movement for the Defense of Social and
Political Rights, who entered the ministry at 11:50 a.m., left
after Justice Minister Fotis Kouvelis promised them ``positive
developments'' in the case of Mohammed Rashid.
   The interim conservative-leftist government has said decisions
on extradition and other foreign policy matters would be left to
the administration formed after elections scheduled for Nov. 5.
   Rashid, 35, is accused in the bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over
Hawaii in 1982, which killed a Japanese teen-ager and wounded 15
people.
   Extradition has been approved by the Supreme Court, but the
final decision rests with the justice minister.
   Conservative Premier Tzannis Tzannetakis' government is
scheduled to resign Friday and be replaced by a Cabinet that will
run the country during the period leading up to and during the
elections.
   Kouvelis condemned the sit-in, saying the protesters had chosen
to show their support for Rashid in the ``worst way.'' He said
violence would not be used to eject them.
   Rashid has been in custody in Greece since his arrest in May
1988. He first served a five-month prison term for trying to enter
the country with a false Syrian passport and in March was sentenced
to eight more months after homemade knives were discovered in his
cell.

   President Bush signed legislation Tuesday
making a national historic site of the St. Louis County, Mo.,
estate where Ulysses S. Grant and his wife lived before the Civil
War.
   Bush also signed a separate bill paving the way for the
acquisition of three additional houses adjacent to Harry S.
Truman's home in Independence, Mo., which is already a national
historic site.
   The 9.65-acre Grant estate, called White Haven, was the home of
Grant's wife, Julia. The Grants lived there from 1854 to 1860 and
owned the estate until Grant's death in 1885.
   Grant led the Union troops in the Civil War and became the 18th
president in 1869.
   ``The Grants lived together at White Haven during the crucial
pre-Civil War years. It was during this time that Grant's strength
of character was developed through economic adversity,'' Bush said
in a statement.
   Grant developed then such traits as ``a relentless pursuit of
success and a determination to move ahead despite temporary
setbacks'' that later served him well both ``as an incomparable
military leader'' and in the White House, Bush said.
   While saying White Haven will be ``a worthy addition to the
National Park System,'' Bush expressed chagrin that Congress passed
it without first waiting for a formal study as the Interior
Department had recommended.
   Bush said that in the future, completion of a formal study
``should be a prerequisite for establishment of any new unit of the
National Park System.''
   ``Such studies enable the National Park Service to examine the
suitability, feasibility and alternatives for managing proposed new
park units,'' the president said.
   White Haven is in what are now the suburbs of St. Louis. The
County of St. Louis acquired the home after a civic campaign was
launched in 1985 to save the Grant estate.
   While the legislation, sponsored by House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and others, stipulates that the estate
will be donated to the government as a historic site, it allows the
government to acquire other Grant artifacts by either donation or
purchase.
   It also authorizes the Interior Department to spend up to $1
million restoring the estate, and estimates the annual operating
budget and upkeep at $400,000.
   The separate Truman legislation authorizes the government to
spend $250,000 acquiring three houses in Independence adjacent to
the Truman home, giving the current owners the right of tenancy for
25 years or until death, whichever is later.
   Administration officials estimated it will cost $75,000 to
repair and convert a vacant house into a visitors' center, with an
annual operating cost of $15,000. The measure was sponsored by Rep.
Alan Wheat, D-Mo., and others.
   Truman, the 33rd president, died in 1972.

<HEAD>Chicago Sues Flag Artists to Test Desecration Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI T. PRASSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten artists who want to display works featuring
the U.S. flag are being sued by the city, which wants to test a new
statute outlawing flag desecration, lawyers said Tuesday.
   ``These artists each have done works that depict the flag,''
said Gwen Osborne, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties
Union in Chicago.
   ``Needless to say, curators and galleries were hesitant to
display them,'' Osborne, whose organization is representing the
artists.
   The lawsuit, filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, was
moved to the court of U.S. District Judge George M. Marovich after
the ACLU said the case raised questions of constitutionality.
   ``Even though the artists are named as defendants, essentially
we are asking the judge to make a decision as to whether the flag
ordinance is constitutional and can be enforced,'' said Connie
Busceni, spokeswoman for the office of the city's corporation
counsel.
   ``If it is, we'll decide what we want to do then'' regarding
prosecuting the artists for their displays, she said.
   The artists' sculptures, paintings and collages are part of a
two-month exhibit probing censorship of the arts. The artists could
not be reached immediately for comment.
   The multi-media exhibit, called ``Inalienable Rights, Alienable
Wrongs,'' also features poetry readings and film. Bookstores,
galleries and theaters are showing segments of the exhibit from
Sept. 15 through Nov. 15, said Harvey Grossman, the ACLU's legal
director.
   Galleries, fearing prosecution, have refused to display the
segment focusing on the U.S. flag, he said.
   ``These artists and curators must be able to exhibit their works
without the threat of arrest, seizure of their art and meritless
prosecutions,'' Grossman said.
   The ACLU sent a letter Sept. 25 to the city's attorneys and the
police chief on behalf of the 10 artists, who believed they might
be arrested if their flag-related works were shown.
   Instead of responding directly, Grossman said, the city filed
the lawsuit to seek clarification of the ordinance passed March 16.
   The measure was prompted by the controversy that erupted when
student artist ``Dread'' Scott Tyler placed a flag on the floor for
his piece, ``What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' The
work was part of a student exhibit at the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago.
   Scott's work outraged many veterans and others. Thousands
marched and demonstrated at the museum, demanding removal of the
work.
   The City Council then passed the ordinance barring the display
of U.S. flags on the floor or of flags that have been marked or
have items attached to them. It also prohibits reproducing the flag
on merchandise or containers.
   The ACLU said the law is vague and the wording makes it unclear
what type of artwork would be in violation of the ordinance.
   Tyler, one of the artists named in the suit, does not have a
listed telephone and could not be reached through an artists' group
with which he is affiliated.

   The U.S. Coast Guard said it

the crew of six Colombians and four Peruvians.
   In a statement released late Monday, the Coast Guard said the
freighter Argovind was seized off the coast of the Dutch island of
Saba in the eastern Caribbean early Sunday and brought to the Coast
Guard base in San Juan.
   U.S. Customs agents discovered the drugs Monday in a shipping
container, the release said.
   The Colombian and Peruvian crewmen, who were not identified by
the Coast Guard, were turned over to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. The cocaine, for which no value was given,
was turned over to the Drug Enforcement Agency, the release said.
   The release did not mention the ship's registry or origin. Coast
Guard public affairs officials in San Juan could not be reached for
comment Tuesday.

<HEAD>New State Rules Ban Gay Men, IV Drug Users From Donating Sperm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sperm banks in the state can no longer
accept gay men and intravenous drug users as donors because of new
state health regulations prompted by fears about AIDS, officials
said Tuesday.
   For the first time, sperm banks must get a state license and
must subject all donors to at least two AIDS tests before their
sperm is used, said Mary Anne Gardineer, an associate director of
the New York state Health Department.
   ``Women who choose to undergo artificial insemination should not
be subjected to unnecessary risks for serious and even fatal
illnesses,'' she said.
   The regulations took effect Monday and automatically exclude a
person from donating sperm if he has had homosexual activity,
intravenous drug use or sex since 1977 with a person at high risk
for the AIDS virus.
   The same people already are barred from donating blood in the
state for the same reason, Gardineer said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   The national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta have no
documented cases of AIDS being transmitted through sperm donors,
said a spokesman, Chuck Fallis.
   Gardineer said Australia had one case _ eight women who received
sperm from the same donor, who tested positive for the AIDS virus.
Four of the women later tested positive for the virus, but three of
their babies born through artificial insemination were healthy,
Gardineer said. The fourth pregnancy never came to term.
   New York state has about one-quarter of the nation's AIDS cases
with 25,000 confirmed cases.
   Geoffrey Knox, a spokesman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, said
he had no problem with the sperm bank prohibition against gay men.
   ``We have the same goal in mind, which is having a safe sperm
bank,'' Knox said.
   The new state rules forbid the release of a sperm donor's name
and address, except in cases where the man specifically gives his
consent.
   Gardineer said she could not be sure how many sperm banks the
state has because they have never been licensed before.
   The regulations don't apply in cases where a person is donating
sperm for a specific person, such as his wife.

<HEAD>Cameraman Meets With CBS News Chief on Fakery Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A free-lance cameraman accused in a newspaper of
faking combat footage aired on ``The CBS Evening News'' met Tuesday
with CBS News president David Burke, a representative of CBS News
said.
   However, the CBS representative declined comment when asked
whether Burke and cameraman Mike Hoover discussed the accusations
against Hoover, or whether another meeting has been scheduled.
   The New York Post reported claims last Wednesday that footage
broadcast by CBS in 1984 was fake _ that Hoover had staged scenes
of guerrilla sabotage and had made a Pakistani jet fighter on a
training run appear to be a Soviet plane bombing Afghan villages.
   As a free-lancer, Hoover sold the film to CBS News, which he
said had approved his proposals for trips inside Afghanistan to
film the war there. Some of his footage also was used in a 1987
``CBS Reports'' documentary, ``The Battle for Afghanistan.''
   The Post reported earlier Tuesday that Hoover had flown in from
New Zealand for the CBS interview and would be accompanied by an
attorney at the meeting.
   The cameraman, who last week did not return calls made by
reporters to his residences in Los Angeles and Wyoming, was not
available for comment Tuesday.
   Burke, too, was not available. On Tuesday afternoon, his
secretary told one reporter seeking to interview the news division
president on the Post's claims: ``We're not taking any press calls.
The press calls are being taken by the (CBS News) press office.''
   Burke, who rarely grants interviews under any circumstances, has
made no direct comment on the newspaper's report.
   His only comment, made last Wednesday in a prepared statement,
was that it ``is the goal of CBS News in every instance to gather
and report the news accurately, fairly and with integrity. In the
case of the Afghan war, we believe we have done so.''
   Joh Greene, a member of CBS' affiliates board and head of its
news subcommittee, said Friday that the network's affiliate
relations executives have told him CBS officials are looking into
the matter.

   Lebanese legislators considered a
proposal Tuesday to expand the 99-seat Parliament, giving Moslems
more representation under a new constitution aimed at ending the
long sectarian civil war.
   They also examined ways of increasing the powers of the prime
minister, traditionally a Sunni Moslem, Lebanese sources said on
condition of anonymity.
   Sixty-three of Parliament's 73 surviving deputies have been
meeting in Taif since Saturday in a session removed from Lebanon
because of a battle that began in March between Christians and a
Moslem alliance led by Syrian troops.
   At the United Nations in New York, Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Shara said his country would not withdraw its 40,000
soldiers and claimed the military presence guarantees some
stability in Lebanon.
   In the General Assembly, he said Syria would help a Lebanese
government of ``national reconciliation to extend its authority all
over the Lebanese territory, motivated by the special
Syrian-Lebanese relationship.''
   In Tehran, Iran, leaders of the two main Moslem militia factions
in Lebanon, Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt and Nabih Berri, head of
the Shiite militia Amal, conferred with Iran's spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, said Khamenei told them:
``Lebanon is an Islamic country, and control must be wrenched out
of Maronite (Christian) hands.''
   The trip to Tehran by Jumblatt and Berri prompted fears among
some legislators that Iran would try to undermine their peace
efforts.
   A new charter they are considering would give the Cabinet the
power to veto presidential decisions. The authority of the
president himself, a Christian under Lebanon's 46-year-old
unwritten national covenant, would otherwise remain untouched.
   Christians have dominated the government, army and judiciary
since Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943. They were
considered to be the majority in 1943, but Moslems now are
estimated to account for 55 percent of the 4 million people.
   Conference sources said the legislators were moving toward
``balancing and overlapping powers'' of the president, prime
minister and the Parliament speaker, who traditionally is a Shiite
Moslem.
   The draft charter was put forth by an Arab League committee of
Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Morocco, which has a mandate to settle
the 14-year-old civil war by the end of November.
   Sources said the draft would increase the number of deputies in
the unicameral Parliament to from 99 to 128, but many legislators
appeared to favor adding only nine seats, all for Moslems.
   Ten days ago, the Arab committee succeeded in halting six months
of bloody duels between Christian army units under Gen. Michel Aoun
and Syrian troops.
   Syria sent troops into Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate
from the Arab League.
   Christians want the Syrian soldiers removed, describing them as
an occupation force rather than peacekeepers.
   The legislators are expected to formulate the charter while in
Taif but leave its ratification for another session, tentatively
planned for Oct.21 in Beirut.

   Fifteen years earlier, they were crowned Valentine's Day King

   They say they don't remember much about their first coronation.
But Sundby said there's one thing he remembers about Rolfing: ``I

   Miss Rolfing's family moved away from Rapid City a few years

enrolled as freshmen at Augustana in 1986 and have become good
friends.
   They'll ride in the Augustana Viking Day parade Saturday before

   College presidents and deans say that pressure
for success and financial rewards in sports interferes with the
educational mission of America's schools, a poll released Tuesday
showed.
   U.S. News &amp; World Report said 85.7 percent of college presidents
and deans participating in the poll agreed that ``the pressure for
athletic success and for financial rewards in intercollegiate
sports today has reached a level where it is interfering with the
prime educational mission of America's colleges and universities.''
   About 10 percent disagreed and 4.1 percent had no opinion.
   The poll was conducted more than four months ago, and just 60
percent of the 3,900 college officials contacted responded to the
survey. It is part of the magazine's 1990 ``America's Best
Colleges'' issue that will go on sale next week.
   Other survey results:
   _95 percent said that high school graduates being recruited for
a school's athletic team should be required to meet the same
admissions standards as all other students, while 5 percent said
the standards should be lower.
   _70.6 percent said athletes tend to be channeled into less
academically demanding courses, 28.7 percent disagreed and 0.7
percent had no opinion.
   _75.1 percent felt the sale or distribution of illegal drugs on
campus among athletes is about the same as it is among other
students, 21.6 percent said it is lower among athletes and 3.3
percent said it is greater among athletes.
   _74.5 percent said that incidents of crime, violence and sexual
attack were about the same among athletes as among other students,
10.7 percent said greater among athletes and 14.8 percent said
lower among athletes.

   A custodian was fatally shot Tuesday in
front of about 100 children and teachers in an elementary school
cafeteria by a gunman who opened fire on pupils in the playground
before he fled, police said.
   Police arrested Sylvester Ronald Mitchell, 24, who quit his job
as a janitor at the school shortly before the shooting, warning
that he was mad and that somebody would get hurt, said Leon County
Undersheriff Larry Campbell.
   Harley J. Colvin, 35, was shot in the head with a .22-caliber
rifle from across the cafeteria, Campbell said. He died instantly
as he sat on a stage.
   No children were injured at Killearn Lakes Elementary, but there
was ``total pandemonium for a short period of time,'' Campbell said.
   ``We believe it was an employee ex-employee situation,'' he
said. ``There's been no indication as to any other motivation.''
   Mitchell was arrested soon after the shooting on charges of
murder, aggravated assault and resisting arrest after a brief
scuffle with police about five miles away and just 200 yards from
another school.
   Mitchell quit his job, left the school, went to his car and got
a rifle, then re-entered the building through the cafeteria,
Campbell said.
   ``One of the teachers was very close to the victim,'' Campbell
said. ``When it happened, the teacher hollered to somebody to call
the office. The suspect looked at her, brought the rifle around,
stated `If you call the office, you'll be next.' ''
   The teacher ducked to the floor and Mitchell left the cafeteria,
Campbell said.
   The school's head custodian encountered Mitchell as he left the
building and asked him what he was doing with a rifle. Mitchell
then fired twice at the more than 50 children on the playground,
Campbell said.
   Pupils returned to their classrooms and teachers, social workers
and police officers told them ``the `bad guy' was in custody, that
nobody was going to hurt them,'' Campbell said.
   Parents flocked to school, in a fashionable, forested area just
north of the city, as word of the shooting spread.

<HEAD>USA Network Buys 26-Film Package, Including ``Good Morning, Vietnam''</HEAD>

   Cable television's USA Network said Tuesday it
has bought cable TV rights to 26 current motion pictures, including
the hits ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and ``Three Men and a Baby,'' in
a multimillion-dollar deal.
   USA, which bought the package from Touchstone Pictures, said it
would start airing the films next May. But no decision had been
made which would be the first to be shown, officials of the company
said.
   USA's purchase is ``a reflection of a changing marketplace'' for
syndicated films, said Robert Jacquemin, president of Buena Vista
Television, the TV sales arm of the Walt Disney Co., which owns
Touchstone Pictures.
   ``We think it's one business now,'' he said, referring to
broadcasting and cable. The latter, according to the A.C. Nielsen
Co., is in 51 million of the estimated 92.1 million homes with
television.
   ``It really is a syndication breakthrough for us,'' said USA
president Kay Koplovitz said, whose company last year said it was
spending $250 million for original made-for-cable TV movies airing
this year and next.
   USA's purchase price for the 26 motion pictures pictures was not
disclosed, although sources close to the deal estimated it at about
$50 million. The sale was announced at a news conference here.
   The films, some of which already have aired on pay cable after
their theatrical runs, include ``The Dead Poets Society,'' the
recently-released ``An Innocent Man'' with Tom Selleck, and the
upcoming ``Blaze'' and ``Stella,'' which star Paul Newman and Bette
Midler, respectively.
   According to David Kenin, USA's senior vice-president for
programming, the films face two steps before airing on USA, which
says it has more than 49 million subscriberss and is one of the
nation's largest basic cable services.
   The smaller Showtime network, a pay cable with nearly 10.5
million subscribers, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co., can air the
films first under an existing agreement.
   Then, he said, CBS, NBC or ABC could buy rights to air the films
on their networks.

<TEXT>
   There's a possibility U.S. forces will have to
withdraw from their four major bases in Greece next year, a State
Department official said Tuesday.
   Negotiations on continued use of the bases are expected to
resume after elections and formation of a new Greek government in
November.
   Once the talks restart, ``I don't think anyone can rule out that
the negotiations might be unsuccessful,'' Assistant Secretary of
State Raymond G. H. Seitz told a House subcommittee on Europe and
the Middle East.
   ``I think we're close to agreement,'' Seitz said, describing the
situation at the last session of the negotiations in May. But there
are many uncertainties, he indicated in answering a battery of
questions.
   He said the United States expects to resume negotiations but
``we don't know'' what kind of government will be elected or what
its mandate will be.
   ``The answer is yes,'' Seitz answered with evident hesitation to
the question of whether there was any contingency planning for
dismantling of the bases by Greece's May, 1990, deadline for a new
agreement.
   Greece's interim government said in July the installations must
be dismantled by then if a new pact is not concluded.
   A five-year agreement signed by the former Socialist government
expired last year and the 1990 deadline was fixed for removal of
the bases in absence of new arrangements.
   The current governing coalition of conservatives and leftists
has said it will avoid national issues, including the bases matter,
until after the election. It was formed after the June 18 vote
failed to give any simgle party a majority in the 300-member
one-chamber parliament. The interim government has said it will
deal mainly with scandals surrounding officials of the defeated
administration of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou.
   Two of the U.S. bases are on the Aegean island of Crete, where
the Navy's 6th Fleet refuels and the Air Force maintains a
communications station. The Navy has a listening post near Athens
and the Air Force has a support group at Hellenikon, outside Athens
International Airport.

<HEAD>Abortion Restrictions Proposed in House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE McGRAW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawmaker introduced a measure Tuesday
that would place sweeping restrictions on abortion in Pennsylvania
and directly challenge a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling giving
women the right to end a pregnancy.
   Rep. Stephen Freind, R-Del., outlined the five-part proposal he
said shows Pennsylvania will ``always be down-the-line pro-life.''
   The Supreme Court earlier this year gave states broader powers
to restrict a woman's access to abortions. Freind's bill, which has
the backing of Gov. Robert P. Casey, could be the first to be
adopted since that ruling in July.
   Also Tuesday, a legislative committee in Madison, Wis.,
recommended approval of a measure to repeal an obsolete state law
establishing prison penalties for women who have abortions and
doctors who perform them.
   The bill would repeal the currently unenforceable penalties for
both physicians and women, although a law passed in 1985 stated
women who had abortions would not be prosecuted.
   At a Capitol news conference in Harrisburg, Freind said his
proposal would give the high court another chance to overturn the
``Roe vs. Wade'' decision.
   His legislation would require a 24-hour waiting period before a
woman can have an abortion; outlaw all abortions after the 24th
week of pregnancy except to save the woman's life; and ban
abortions used for choosing the sex of a child.
   It also would require notification of the husband before a woman
has an abortion except in a few cases; order physicians to inform
women of the surgical procedure to be used, the fetus' stage of
development, the dangers of childbirth and abortion, and
alternatives to abortion; and ban most fetal experimentation, which
includes prohibiting the sale and use of tissue, organs or other
remains from the aborted fetus.
   After the news conference, an estimated 8,500 anti-abortion
advocates cheered Freind and his proposal at a rally on the state
Capitol steps. People carried graphic signs showing aborted fetuses
and saying ``The unborn need freedom too,'' and ``Pro-choice means
pro murder.''
   More than 5,000 pro-choice supporters held a rally here last
week.
   ``One difference between them and us is that we have joy and
they can't,'' Freind said. ``Because there is nothing joyous in the
killing of unborn children.''
   Freind's bill has more than 70 co-sponsors, some of whom joined
him at the news conference and the rally along with leaders of
various anti-abortion groups.
   The lawmaker said he expected his proposal to pass the General
Assembly and move to the governor sometime later this month or
early next month.
   Also Tuesday, abortion rights advocates formally introduced
their legislative package. It includes a proposed constitutional
amendment affirming a woman's right to have an abortion.
   The pro-choice bills would restore government funding for poor
women who have ``medically necessary'' abortions and would weaken a
state law that requires parental notification or a court order
before a minor can obtain an abortion. That provision is not in
effect because it under court review.
   Pro-choice advocates said a majority of Pennsylvania's voters
support a woman's right to choose.
   In a poll of 500 likely voters in the state, the National
Abortion Rights Action League said 60 percent of the respondents
favored keeping abortion legal, while 33 percent wanted to outlaw
it.
   ``This data shows how dramatically out-of-step Pennsylvania's
officials are with their constituents on abortion,'' said Kate
Michelman, the league's executive director.
   ``The political atmosphere surrounding choice is more highly
charged than ever. ... Politicians in Pennsylvania who support
abortion restrictions in 1989 may well be voted out of office in
1990.''
   The poll, conducted by Hickman-Maslin Research Inc., has a
margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percent. The polling was done
Sept. 25-28.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp on Tuesday
proposed major management changes at the scandal-tarred Department
of Housing and Urban Development, including eliminating programs
and a special fund he said either were tainted by political
influence or not targeted to the needy.
   ``Many past funding decisions were, frankly, based on political
influence rather than merit,'' Kemp said in releasing his 58-point
plan to reform the agency. ``Under my stewardship, no decisions
will be made at HUD for the political advantage or personal gain of
any one person or of a political party.''
   Kemp, in his first news conference as secretary, also announced
that HUD has barred from doing government business a mortgage
lender whose defaults in a HUD program total more than $700 million.
   While praising the congressional investigation of influence
peddling, fraud and mismanagement at HUD during the Reagan
administration, Kemp said he did not believe it was necessary to
appoint a special prosecutor, as suggested by some Republicans and
Democrats involved in the reviews.
   Kemp's proposed changes range from regulatory and administrative
steps he can take immediately to more complex changes that would
require congressional approval.
   The agency's Federal Housing Administration and its
multibillion-dollar loan programs would be significantly affected,
with several programs Kemp said have deviated from helping the
needy eliminated outright.
   And the entire agency would be subjected to intense public
scrutiny through the publishing of all funding and other major
decisions in the Federal Register. Kemp also promised to improve
targeting of scarce HUD funds to those most in need and vowed to
try to collect money bilked from the agency in the past.
   More proposals are likely, he said, after additional reviews of
HUD management.
   Initial reaction from members of Congress was favorable,
although there was opposition to what some lawmakers interpreted as
a Kemp effort to kill the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation
Program, which HUD's inspector general said in April was riddled
with influence peddling by former agency officials and prominent
Republican consultants. Kemp did not directly propose killing the
program but referred to its problems and said its goals could be
accomplished through several other HUD programs.
   ``I think the secretary's recommendations with respect to
ethics, management reform, tighter fiscal controls, the
introduction of a chief financial officer of HUD, are all
excellent,'' said Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., the chairman of a
House subcommittee investigation of the department.
   ``When we come into the programatic field, I think we'll have to
study those recommendations much more carefully,'' said Lantos,
among a number of lawmakers who said they were not yet convinced
the rehabilitation program should be killed instead of reformed.
   Many of Kemp's proposals mirror those in a largely ignored 1984
General Accounting Office report to Congress, while others were
molded after more recent suggestions made in Congress to limit the
role of lobbyists and consultants in government funding decisions.
Still others came from Kemp aides after their own review.
   Eliminated along with the ``Mod Rehab'' program would be
discretionary funds under the HUD secretary's control. ``We are
trying to get rid of the slush fund approach,'' said HUD
Undersecretary Alfred DelliBovi.
   HUD budgets traditionally have included a large set-aside for
the secretary's discretionary fund, and HUD and congressional
investigators have found several instances in which projects that
had been opposed by agency experts were funded through the account.
   Kemp also proposed killing another program, HUD's Title X land
development insurance, citing use of the money to build upscale
projects such as a condominium-golf complex in California. FHA
programs for vacation home loans,
   But he said he was committed to HUD's co-insurance program, to
date the source of nearly $1 billion in sour loans. The program
allows private lenders to approve HUD-insured mortgages and was a
major part of the Reagan administration's efforts to reduce the
federal work force by contracting business to private companies.
   The company Kemp said has been barred from HUD work, DRG Funding
Corp., has experienced defaults on $709 million of the $1.1 billion
in HUD-insured loans it approved. The government is liable for 80
percent of such mortgages.
   ``The problem was not the idea,'' Kemp said. ``The problem was
in the implementation of the idea. ... These reforms are designed
to make a good idea better.''
   Kemp said the program would be revived with improved HUD
oversight of the lenders and new certification requirements for the
lenders, appraisers and others involved in handling the
applications.
   Other highlights of the Kemp package include:
   _Appointment of a chief financial officer for HUD and a separate
comptroller for the FHA, whose loan programs have been troubled by
fraud and mismanagement believed to have cost more than $4 billion.
   _Requiring all lobbyists and consultants who work on HUD
proposals to register with the department and disclose their fees,
which HUD could deduct from any funding awards. Kemp asked Congress
to impose civil fines of up to $10,000 for violations of the
registration requirement. He also proposed similar fines for HUD
employees who disclose funding decisions prior to public
announcements.
   _Allocating up to $100 million for monitoring of HUD housing and
community development programs. Kemp said the department now spends
less than $25 million to track annual grants totaling nearly 10
times that amount.
   _Allowing HUD officials to adjust subsidy and loan amounts to
take into account other benefits developers receive for building
low-income housing, including tax credits.
   _Increasing the staff of the department's inspector general and
granting the office the power to subpoena witnesses for its
investigations.
   _Offering incentives to low-income homeowners who got
HUD-insured mortgages to encourage them to refinance at today's
lower interest rates, something Kemp said could save the government
$200 million.
   _Raising from 60 percent to 100 percent the amount of Community
Development Block Grant money that affluent communities must spend
on projects benefiting low- and moderate-income residents.
   _Requiring the FHA to be audited annually and to begin
program-by-program accounting and regional accounting. Kemp said
that shoddy record keeping has prevented a thorough audit of FHA
for the past 15 years, that umbrella accounting practices have
failed to detect problems in specific programs and that current
practices do not take into account regional differences in the real
estate market.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany issued an order
Tuesday banning free travel to Czechoslovakia but agreed that at
least 10,000 of its citizens already in Prague could emigrate to
the West.
   East German leader Erich Honecker accused West Germany of
``insolently breaking promises'' by letting the East Germans into
its embassies in Prague and Warsaw.
   ``They believe in West Germany that they can destabilize East
Germany with a broad-based attack, but it will not work,'' he said
in his first major speech since returning to work after a long
convalescence from gallbladder surgery. ADN, the official East
German news agency, carried his remarks.
   The crackdown on travel came after hundreds of East Germans
stormed through police lines to get inside the embassy in Prague.
   They climbed facades, rooftops and a fence to reach the crowded
compound. Many were left blood-spattered by police and some fell
unconscious inside the grounds.
   Rudolf Seiters, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff,
initially said East German refugees would begin leaving Prague for
West Germany by train Tuesday evening, but their departure was
delayed for hours.
   Police were withdrawn from the railroad station at 10 p.m., and
an hour later the refugees were still in and around the embassy,
waiting in freezing weather.
   Seiters said an estimated 4,700 refugees in the the embassy and
about 6,000 milling outside would be traveling west.
   He said Kohl was informed of the East German decision by Premier
Ladislav Adamec of Czechoslovakia.
   East Germany's decision appeared to be part of an effort to
avoid possible embarrassing disturbances during celebrations of the
communist state's 40th anniversary Saturday. Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gobachev is scheduled to attend.
   Thousands of East Germans have streamed across the border into
neighboring Czechoslovakia and to other Soviet bloc countries in
the last few weeks in an attempt to reach West Gemany.
   ADN said the travel ban stemmed from reports ``that certain
circles in West Germany are preparing provocations'' in conjunction
with the celebrations.
   Last weekend, East Germany agreed to the departure of about
7,000 refugees from the West German embassies in Prague and in
Warsaw, Poland, but said it was a one-time arrangement.
   Previously, East Germans did not need a visa or passport to
reach Czechoslovakia, but ADN said such documents would be required
from now on. That effectively bans all ordinary East Germans from
traveling to Czechoslovakia.
   It also will make it much more difficult for East Germans to
reach Hungary, where the liberal leadership opened its western
border Sept. 11, since the usual route to Hungary is through
Czechoslovakia.
   West Germany closed its embassy early Tuesday after thousands of
East Germans streamed into the compound overnight, bringing the
total seeking asylum there to some 4,500. Red Cross officials said
they feared sanitation problems.
   After the East German decision was announced, the embassy opened
its doors, refugees said.
   Hundreds of East Germans hopeful of gaining access to the
embassy had continued arriving throughout Tuesday, and they grew
desperate as the day wore on.
   Police had blockaded the embassy garden fence, but nearly 300
refugees stormed the police lines, scaled the fence and fought off
club-wielding police trying to keep them back.
   ``They clubbed like mad,'' a Czechoslovak witness said.
   Witnesses said many people were injured in scuffles with police.
Others got caught on the sharp spikes at the top of the fence and
still others jumped or fell head first to the ground. Some lay
unconscious inside the compound, witnesses said.
   ``This is pandemonium,'' said a Red Cross assistant handling
injured refugees. Only a doctor and several refugees witnessed the
incident.
   In Bonn, chief government spokesman Hans Klein said Honecker
refused to talk to Kohl by telephone Tuesday about the problem.
   Klein told reporters Honecker aides told the West Germans
preparations for Satuday's celebrations precluded an ``appointment
for a telephone call.''
   The Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda came to East Germany's
defense, accusing West Germany of interfering in East German
affairs.
   West German officials have said Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union was instrumental in winning the
release of the East German refugees during the weekend.
   Earlier Tuesday, Czechoslovak government spokesman Miroslav
Pavel said the East Germans in Prague were seriously upsetting
``public order.'' He said other embassies in the area, including
the U.S. Embassy, had requested increased protection.
   In the West German Embassy in Warsaw, the number of East Germans
arriving over the past two days reached about 300, officials said.
   Refugees in Warsaw said their government was no longer issuing
the special travel cards needed for Poland as quickly as in the
past.
   More than 120,000 East Germans have reached West Germany so far
this year, either legally or illegally. They say they are denied
basic freedoms in their country.
   West German Ambassador Hermann Huber was summoned to the Foreign
Ministry on Tuesday to receive a formal protest note for what the
state news agency CTK said was West German violation of the 1961
convention on diplomatic relations.
   The protest referred to the ``undesirable situation'' caused by
the ``illegal stay of GDR (East German) citizens'' at Bonn's
mission and said Czechoslovakia expects West German authorities
will seek to prevent a repetition of the situation.

   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
and President Bush on Tuesday pledged mutual trust and
understanding on cross-boundary issues, agreeing to conduct trade
negotiations and to clean up Mexico City and Tijuana pollution.
   Salinas publicly raised the touchy trade issue, calling on the
United States to open its markets to Mexican products _ something
U.S. officials say is largely true anyway.
   During a lengthy toast that amounted to a speech at a state
dinner in his honor at the White House, Salinas noted changes in
the Mexican economy.
   ``Few economies have opened up as much and as rapidly as
Mexico's. A similar opening of the American market would not only
represent reciprocal treatment, but a stimulus to our new
friendship,'' the Mexican leader said. He praised Bush for open and
substantial dialogue and said it signalled ``a new relationship of
friendship free of myths and mistrusts.''
   Bush in a very brief toast also talked of close ties between the
two neighbors and thanked Salinas for his efforts in fighting drug
trafficking.
   Bush during his presidential campaign said he would seek a free
trade agreement with Mexico, possibly akin to the one negotiated
with Canda under former President Reagan. However, no such
agreement has materialized.
   To mark Salinas' visit to Washington, the two governments signed
seven agreements on trade, environment, investment, and tourism.
   The agreements, Bush said in praising the ``closeness'' of
U.S.-Mexico ties, ``are concrete examples of how our
administrations have worked closely together during the last 10
months. They show what can and must be done to make relations
between our two great nations even closer than they are today.''
   Salinas also cheered for a close relationship, but said his
primary goal in facilitating U.S. investment in Mexico was to
``open up additional sources of employment in Mexico for Mexicans.''
   The agreements were generally non-specific, but two
environmental pacts commit the nations to construct an
international sewage treatment plant in California, just across the
border from Tijuana. They also will conduct joint scientific and
technical projects to fight air pollution in Mexico City.
   The sewage problem has become a matter of increasing
U.S.-Mexican tensions because Tijuana waste pollutes the waters and
the beaches of San Diego.
   The agreement provides that the new plant will provide secondary
treatment and disposal of waste not now treated in Tijuana.
   Salinas, in remarks at the signing ceremony also acknowledged
Mexico City is ``the most polluted city in the world. ... We want
better air for the Mexicans for their children and for children of
their children in Mexico.''
   The two countries agreed to work on the problem of smog in the
Mexican capital, through ``technology transfers, scientific and
technical advice, environmental monitoring, and environmental
impact assessments by Mexican authorities, joint meetings and
reviews, exchange of relevant personnel and exchanges of
environmental information and data, coordination on national
programs'' and funding cooperation.
   A separate environmental agreement committed the two countries
to address air pollution in urban border areas, beginning with El
Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua in Mexico.
   The agreement on trade, signed at the White House by Secretary
of State James A. Baker III and his Mexican counterpart, Fernando
Solana, was an agreement to negotiate toward ``facilitating and
enhancing'' U.S.-Mexico trade relations.
   In November, the two countries are to decide what trade issues
are negotiable.
   A separate agreement commited the countries to work on easing
investment opportunity for U.S. firms in Mexico.
   Salinas said that pact, ``will further the investment processes
so that Mexicans can find a job in Mexico. That is the central
purpose of my visit to this country.''
   Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher will travel to Mexico in
November to discuss the investment situation, officials said.
   The Mexican president was with Bush when word arrived from U.S.
military forces in Panama that gunshots had been heard near the
military headquarters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, said Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. There were reports of a coup attempt.
   Salinas and Bush were briefed on what details were available by
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, said Fitzwater.
   Bush in an outdoor White House welcoming ceremony for Salinas
said the two countries must cooperate in efforts to bring about
democracy in Panama as well as for fair elections in Nicaragua.
   Bush said the United States and Mexico ``must continue to
strengthen our assault on the plague of drug use and trafficking.
For we know that what threatens one nation in our hemisphere
threatens us all.''
   ``We can strike lethal blows against drug trafficking to free
the world from that international scourge,'' Salinas added, vowing
to fight jointly against illegal narcotics trafficking.
   Salinas speaking through a translator called for more humane
ways to deal with migration of Mexicans to the United States.
   The Mexican called for a ``new stage'' in trade relations. He
earlier had said he would seek trade concessions Mexican exports
such as textiles, steel and agricultural products. But U.S.
officials have disagreed with his contention that Mexico has
difficulty penetrating American markets.
   One official said that until recently Mexico was one of the most
protectionist countries in the world.
   Mexico has a $2.7 billion trade surplus with the United States
on total two-way trade of $43.9 billion, the official said.
   The administration and the Mexicans also signed a tourism
agreement geared toward easing procedures to promote U.S. tourism
in Mexico.

   Snow fell in the mountains of Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, but it
was mostly dry weather for the eastern half of the nation except
for a few showers in the Northeast.
   Yellowstone, Mont., reported 5 inches of snow on the ground by
Tuesday morning, and 1 to 3 inches of new snow was expected above
5000 feet in the Montana's south central and southwestern mountains
of montana.
   Snowfall of 4 to 7 inches was expected above 7500 feet in the
northwest mountains of Wyoming, and Idaho's eastern mountains
expected 2 to 4 inches through Tuesday night.
   Snow in the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada range of
California and Nevada was gradually coming to an end, but the same
storm system kicked up wind gusts to 45 mph in northern and central
Arizona and Nevada.
   Widely scattered rainshowers extended from south central Arizona
across parts of New Mexico while a few showers lingered in the
Northeast. Otherwise, dry weather prevailed east of the Rockies.
   Dense fog was reported early Tuesday In pennsylvania, Tennessee,
Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and along the coast of Texas. Fair
skies were over much of the rest of the central and eastern United
States.
   The nation's north central and northwestern regions had record
low temperatures for the date in a dozen cities.
   Bismarck, N.D., recorded a low of 16, eclipsing the 24-degree
mark of 1935; Mason City Iowa's record low was 26 (27 in 1987);

<HEAD>Court Calls Textbook Inspection Legal, But Finds History Distortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese court Tuesday ruled legal a government
program of screening school textbooks, including deleting
references to some Japanese military actions in World War II.
   Such government screening brought protests earlier from China
and other countries, which accused Japan of trying to cover up
military brutality.
   Despite its ruling on wartime operations, the court held in one
case that a government-ordered rewrite distorted history.
   The Tokyo District Court ruled in Professor Saburo Iyenaga's
25-year battle against the Education Ministry's textbook screening.
It ordered the ministry to pay him $711.
   Iyenaga, who writes textbooks, plans to appeal to the High
Court, said district court spokesman Akira Saito.
   Iyenaga, 76, had demanded $14,235 and wanted the screening
system overturned. His complaint dealt mainly with
government-ordered rewrites concerning Japan's actions in World War
II. The court rejected that portion of his argument.
   However, Judge Kazuo Kato said the Education Ministry abused its
inspection authority and contradicted mainstream academic theories
in ordering Iyenaga to rewrite part of a 1980 textbook dealing with
an attempted coup by farmers against the Tokugawa Shogunate
government in 1868.
   The court ruled against Iyenaga on his complaints that in
writing textbooks, he could not use the terms ``invasion,''
``Nanking massacre,'' ``No. 731 regiment'' and ``battle in
Okinawa'' in describing wartime actions by Japanese troops.
   China says more than 300,000 people, mostly civilians, were
killed or raped by Japanese soldiers in December 1937 after
Nanking, then China's capital, fell to Japanese invasion forces.
Western historians have estimated that 200,000 were killed in the
massacre.
   The Battle of Okinawa in 1945 was Japan's last and bloodiest
stand during World War II. Okinawan officials said Japanese troops
killed 800 Okinawan civilians because they were an obstacle to
military operations and ordered others to commit suicide.
   No. 731 regiment refers to a unit alleged to have conducted germ
experiments on war prisoners.
   Kato said textbook inspection was justified to preserve accuracy
and neutrality in education. He held that textbook inspection does
not violate the constitutional right to freedom of expression
because material rejected by the ministry still can be published.
   He said in his ruling, ``Considering students' inability to
evaluate educational contents, the little choice of educational
tools allowed to teachers, and the need for equal opportunity for
education, the government cannot allow teachers complete freedom to
publish their own studies as textbooks.''
   Education Minister Kazuya Ishibashi said in a statement, ``The
adequacy and necessity of the textbook inspection system were
reconfirmed by today's court ruling, and we in the Education
Ministry will work even harder to make the contents of textbooks
more satisfying.
   He said, however, that he objected to the payment and said the
government might appeal.
   Iyenaga told reporters, ``We are very disappointed by the
ruling. But the Education Ministry should take it seriously and
blame itself for having gone too far in its censorship.
   ``I am also disappointed by the court's backward and biased
attitude.''
   The suit, filed in 1984, was Iyenaga's third against the
screening system.

<HEAD>Tropical Depression Thirteen Weakens in Atlantic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Atlantic tropical depression that forecasters
originally feared might strengthen into a tropical storm broke up
Tuesday.
   ``I don't think we're going to have to worry about it any
longer,'' said Robert Molleda, spokesman for the National Hurricane
Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, forecasters said the latest satellite pictures
showed the depression was no longer identifiable due the strong
upper level winds that developed over the system throughout the
preceeding 12 hours.
   No more advisories would be issued on the system unless it
regenerated, which was not expected, the center reported.
   The depression, the 13th of the Atlantic hurricane season,
formed Monday. Forecasters earlier had warned the system could
intensify to tropical storm strength by Tuesday.
   At noon EDT, the system had top sustained winds near 35 mph and
was centered near 17 degrees north latitude and 50 degrees west
longitude, about 800 miles east of the Leeward Islands.
   When a system's maximum sustained winds reach 39 mph, it becomes
a named storm, and is classified a hurricane at 74 mph. Hurricane
Hugo was the eighth named storm and the fifth hurricane of the
Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<TEXT>
   A sobbing Cyndy Garvey was released from jail
Tuesday, one day after she was arrested for refusing to allow
ex-husband Steve Garvey court-ordered visits with their two
daughters.
   Ms. Garvey climbed into a BMW automobile with her attorney at
2:20 p.m. She didn't speak to a dozen reporters and camera crews
awaiting her release from the Sybil Brand Institute, the county's
jail for women.
   Garvey, a former baseball star, meanwhile, was ``somewhere in
Southern California'' with his two teen-age daughters, his lawyer
said. They will stay with him through the week.
   Ms. Garvey was released several hours after the 2nd Court of
Appeals said the Superior Court had ``abused its discretion'' by
not granting her bail after it ordered her to jail Monday for
contempt of court.
   Superior Court Judge Frances Rothschild had convicted her of
violating a December 1988 order that required daughters Whitney,
13, and Krisha, 14, to spend every Tuesday afternoon and two
weekends a month with their father.
   Ms. Garvey, a substitute on a Cable News Network talk show, was
found guilty of 43 contempt of court violations. She was ordered to
spend five days in jail, then return Nov. 3 for a hearing on an
additional 126-day jail sentence and two years probation.
   Garvey, a first baseman who had an 18-year major league career
with the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, was divorced
from Ms. Garvey in 1981 and recently remarried.
   The former baseball star was in the news earlier this year when
he admitted that he had fathered the children of two other women.
One of them is suing him.

   Shellfish harvesting was banned Tuesday
and warnings were issued against swimming in ocean water and rivers
choked with untreated sewage because of damage from Hurricane Hugo.
   U.S. Sen. Ernest Hollings said he would ask for an investigation
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's response to victims of
the hurricane, but Marilyn Quayle, wife of the vice president, said
the agency had been unfairly criticized.
   Crews working to re-establish a land link between the barrier
islands and the mainland hoped to raise the Ben Sawyer Bridge back
into place Wednesday during high tide. The bridge, tilted at a
45-degree angle, has rested in the Intracoastal Waterway for 13
days since the hurricane struck.
   Hollings, D-S.C., who last week called employees of FEMA a
``bunch of bureaucratic jackasses,'' said he will ask the General
Accounting Office, Congress' watchdog agency, to investigate FEMA's
``incompetent'' handling of disaster relief.
   FEMA is the agency responsible for coordinating federal aid in
national disasters. The agency, with a budget of $600 million and
2,200 employees, reports directly to the president.
   ``GAO needs to find out why this agency couldn't perform in an
emergency,'' he said from Washington. ``That's FEMA's job; it's in
the title. They're supposed to manage emergencies, not cause them.''
   Hollings criticized FEMA for opening too few offices to handle
disaster relief applications. About 10 offices are open in the 22
South Carolina counties that President Bush declared disaster areas.
   FEMA spokesman Bill McAda said he disagreed with Hollings'
assessment of the agency's response, but said he would welcome an
investigation.
   ``Our charter under law is for the long-term recovery and
response to the situation,'' McAda said by telephone from
Washington. ``I believe we're doing that and under the
circumstances doing it as fast as it can be expected to be done.''
   Mrs. Quayle, in Charleston to help at disaster and American Red
Cross centers, also defended FEMA.
   ``Everyone's natural reaction is to want everything done
yesterday,'' she said. But ``from what I've been able to observe,
FEMA, very frankly, got a bum rap.''
   Sewage treatment plants in the area are only partially
operational and are removing only 30 percent of the pollutants from
sewage. When fully operational, about 95 percent of the pollutants
are removed before the sewage is dumped into the ocean.
   ``The waters are turning black, and there are fish kills all
over,'' said Wayne Fanning of the state Department of Health and
Environmental Control.
   The swimming advisory could last months and possibly affect next
spring's tourist season.
   Some 10 million visitors were attracted last year to the Grand
Strand, 60 miles of beach from Georgetown to the North Carolina
line, and accounted for an estimated 35 percent of the state's
total tourism revenue of $4.7 billion, officials said.
   The long-term effect on the shellfishing industry is ``going to
be devastating,'' Fanning said.
   Shellfishing also is a multimillion-dollar industry in South
Carolina.
   Hurricane Hugo slammed into South Carolina Sept. 21 with 135 mph
wind, killing at least 18 and leaving 50,000 homeless, 270,000
jobless, and homes, businesses, schools and municipal buildings
damaged or destroyed as far inland as Sumter and north to North
Carolina. In all, 29 people were killed on the U.S. mainland.
   Damage in South Carolina alone has been estimated at $3 billion
or more, with crop damage placed at some $100 million.
   South of Charleston, workers planned to float barges under the
dangling section of the Ben Sawyer Bridge and use Wednesday
morning's rising tide to help raise the bridge that connects Isle
of Palms and Sullivans Island to the mainland, said Army Corps of
Engineers spokesman Rod Ruffennach. Then cranes will swing the
bridge back into position.
   The bridge will be left in position for cars until experts
determine if they can repair the swing mechanism that opens the
bridge for boats on the Intracoastal Waterway.
   In Murrells Inlet, 10 miles south of Myrtle Beach, author Mickey
Spillane examined the wreckage of his home and office, where he has
written detective novels since 1963. One section of a wall was
gone, and first editions of his books, including ``I, The Jury,''
and ``My Gun is Quick,'' had disappeared. Also gone was a
manuscript of a book in progress.
   ``Hey, not to worry,'' he said. ``You get a flat tire, you fix
it, right?
   ``The missing manuscript? No big deal. I'll make it up in two
weeks, ... maybe three. That's how long it takes to write a book.''

   Troops loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriego put down an attempted coup by a small rebel force Tuesday,
retaking the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces after a
six-hour gunfight.
   ``This incident corresponds to the permanent aggression of U.S.
forces against the tranquillity of our country. The proof is that
U.S. forces closed access routes to the barracks,'' Noriega said in
a television statement from Defense Forces headquarters after the
fighting sputtered to an end.
   Noriega later stepped out of his headquarters with several
fellow officers and waved to reporters but made no statement.
   The rebels ``surrendered to General Noriega in person,'' said
Defense Forces spokesman Maj. Edgardo Lopez. He said ``more than
60'' rebel troopers and four or five officers had been detained.
The Defense Forces serves as both the military and police and has a
total strength of about 15,000 members.
   Rebel troops seized the headquarters in an attack launched
around 7 a.m. but failed to capture Noriega. Troops loyal to the
general, who commands the Defense Forces and controls the
government, launched a counterattack and by 1 p.m. the shooting had
tapered off as Noriega's backers gained the upper hand. Noriega
appeared on television around 4 p.m.
   The United States, which has been trying to oust Noriega since
he was indicted nearly two years ago in Florida on drug charges,
denied any involvement in the coup attempt. The uprising was
launched by junior Defense Forces officers.
   U.S. troops assigned to the Panama Canal Zone took up positions
about 600 yards from the headquarters, placed between the fighting
at the compound and U.S. installations at Fort Amador and Quarry
Heights. However, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command said
the American troops took no part in the fighting and were
dispatched for security reasons.
   It was the second time in 18 months that Noriega had survived a
coup attempt by his own officers.
   In a radio broadcast after the rebels seized the headquarters
the insurgents claimed Noriega had been ousted, but loyal forces
soon took control of the broadcast networks.
   ``We want to underline that the situation in the country has
been duly controlled to guarantee the peace and tranquillity that
the state should assure for its citizens,'' said a statement
released by Justice and Interior Minister Olmedo Miranda.
   It declared an 8 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew and said the news media
could report only official statements on the revolt.
   Guillermo Ford, an opposition candidate for vice president in
the May 7 election, was interviewed in New York on CBS Evening News
and asked about the foiled coup.
   ``I think Noriega's going to get stronger regarding the
Panamanian people,'' Ford said. ``He's been holding them hostage
for the last two years.
   International observers at the May 7 balloting said the
opposition slate won by a substantial margin but the
Noriega-controlled government annulled the election.
   Panama's provisional president, Francisco Rodriguez, speaking to
the U.N. General Assembly in New York, said the attempted coup
against his government had been crushed.
   Rodriguez, in his midafternoon address, did not accuse the
United States of complicity in the revolt but said Washington had
undermined his nation with ``financial terrorism, economic
blackmail and political interference.''
   A small group of Defense Forces had tried to overthrow Noriega
in March 1988, but that attempt also was crushed quickly by forces
loyal to the general.
   The United States has been been applying pressure on Panama,
including economic sanctions, in an effort to force Noriega to step
down.
   The rebels' claimed in a broadcast around noon that they had
overthrown Noriega and retired top officers, but that communique
was not repeated.
   An officer loyal to Noriega later said the general was at an
undisclosed location controlling the operations against the
insurgents.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday afternoon in
Washington that officials had heard early ``rumblings'' of the
uprising. He said later it appeared that Noriega's forces ``are
back in control.''
   A communique by loyalists, read over Channel 2 television, said,
``The nationalist officers of all ranks and in all the barracks
countrywide have confirmed their loyalty to the fatherland ... and
to our Commander-in-Chief Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.''
   ``The few who allowed themselves to fall prey to cowardice, to
foreign money and to treason are a minority who advocated foreign
intervention,'' the communique added. ``In the next few hours, this
group will appear before justice, covered with shame.''
   Several ambulances were seen leaving the area, and witnesses
said there were some dead and wounded, but the number of casualties
was not immediately known.
   Troops of the Southern Command were put on Delta Alert, the
highest level of readiness.
   About 12,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in Panama, many within
five miles of Panama City. All U.S. civilian dependents were moved
onto U.S. military installations July 1 because of violence that
followed Panamanian elections held May 7. Noriega nullified the
results of the vote, which showed the opposition winning.
   President Bush told reporters in Washington: ``There were rumors
around that this was some American operation, and I can tell you
that is not true. Nobody's sure what's happening there.''
   Rebels managed to gain control of the military headquarters in a
congested part of downtown Panama City. Those loyal to Noriega then
went to the roofs of surrounding buildings, hurling grenades and
firing mortars and small arms into the compound.
   Several hours of gunfire inside and outside the headquarters
preceded the rebel broadcast that said the entire high command was
forced into retirement by middle-ranking officers led by Maj.
Moises Giraldi Vega, head of the Urraca battalion that handles
security at Defense Forces headquarters.
   The radio said the communique announcing a coup was signed by
Giraldi, Capt. Javier Licona of the cavalry and Capt. Jesus George
Balma of the special forces.
   ``This is strictly a military movement. There is no politics
involved,'' the communique said, referring to the civilian
opposition alliance that has been trying to oust Noriega with U.S.
help.
   An hour after the statement was read, a man who identified
himself as Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon, said on pro-Noriega Channel
2 television that loyalists ``were ready to give their lives to
defend Gen. Noriega. This is a betrayal.''
   Castrejon, who identified himself as a spokesman for pro-Noriega
forces, said Noriega remained in control of air and naval units and
of Battalion 2000, a special unit created to defend the Panama
Canal after it is turned over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   Noriega inherited command of the military from Gen. Omar
Torrijos, who seized power in 1968 and was killed in a plane crash
in 1981.
   Noriega claims the U.S. charges of drug trafficking and money
laundering are part of a U.S. plot to abrogate the Panama Canal
treaties of 1977.

<HEAD>Wounded Salvadoran Guerrillas Seek Asylum At Mexican Embassy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-eight wounded guerrillas,
most of them amputees, moved Tuesday to the Mexican Embassy from
the Metropolitan Cathedral they had occupied for six weeks.
   The occupation began Aug. 20 with eight wounded entering the
church and the number had reached 48 by last weekend, annoying both
the rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani and Roman
Catholic Church leaders.
   ``The cathedral is not a hotel,'' Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas,
archbishop of San Salvador, said late last month in an appeal to
vacate the church.
   The guerrillas had said they would stay in the cathedral until
they and wounded comrades on battlefronts were given safe conduct
out of the country for medical treatment.
   But Rivera Damas' chagrin apparently changed their minds. Red
Cross vans took the 46 men and two women from the cathedral to the
Mexican Embassy.
   One man who said he lost his right arm in combat, told The
Associated Press through the embassy gate the wounded will not
comment on future plans until arrangements were worked out with the
Mexican ambassador.
   Access to the embassy was barred. Repeated telephone calls went
unanswered.
   Earlier, insurgents denounced Cristiani's speech Monday to the
U.N. General Assembly in which he called for a cease-fire in the
10-year-old civil war.
   Cristiani, who took office June 1, said his government would
propose a complete cessation of hostilities during peace talks with
rebels scheduled for Oct. 16-17 in Costa Rica.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, umbrella
for five guerrilla groups, has insisted an agreement must be
reached on democratic reforms before the war can end.
   Joaquin Villalobos, a rebel negotiator, said, ``We want
democracy and peace. It must be in that order, because if peace
comes before democracy, it will be the peace of the cemetery.''
   The rebels demand an end to what they call official repression,
an overhaul of the judiciary and reduction of the armed forces.
   ``Cristiani filled his speech with words like human rights,
peace and democracy. At the same time what we're seeing is a wave
of arrests of members of popular organizations ... tortures,
disappearances and murders,'' said the rebels on their clandestine
Radio Venceremos.
   Vice President Francisco Merino told journalists Monday the call
for a cease-fire ``is not a call for the surrender of the FMLN.''
He said a cessation of hostilities ``would create appropriate
conditions for the search for lasting peace.''
   The rebels observed an 11-day unilateral cease-fire between
Sept. 13-23 for the preliminary talks. They accused the government
of taking advantage of the truce to move forces into
guerrilla-controlled zones and arrest leaders of labor and peasant
organizations considered guerrilla fronts by authorities.

   Former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson took the early lead Tuesday
night in an election to reclaim his old job, while a Democratic
state senator and a Republican political aide advanced to a
Mississippi congressional runoff.
   In Cleveland, where Mayor George Voinovich is stepping aside,
City Council President George Forbes and state Sen. Mike White won
the top two spots in a non-partisan mayoral primary and advanced to
a runoff. And Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard sought re-election.
   In Atlanta, Jackson was trying to play leapfrog with incumbent
Mayor Andrew Young, who succeeded him in 1982. With 7 percent of
the precincts reporting, Jackson had 1,567 votes to 485 votes for
City Councilman Hosea Williams.
   Although turnout was light, Jackson had said he hoped for a
large turnout so he would ``get a mandate for action.''
   In Mississippi, state Sen. Gene Taylor and Republican Tom
Anderson each won spots in an Oct. 17 runoff, capturing the top two
spots in a special election to succeed the late Rep. Larkin Smith,
the only Republican in the state's House delegation.
   Taylor and Anderson easily outdistanced the best-known candidate
in the race, Democratic state Attorney General Mike Moore.
   With 81 percent of the 372 precincts reporting, Taylor had
42,725 votes or 42 percent to 37,557 votes or 37 percent for
Anderson, a longtime aide to U.S. Sen. Trent Lott. Moore had 22,082
votes or 22 percent.
   With all 695 precincts reporting in Cleveland, City Council
President George Forbes led with 46,493 votes or 37 percent,
followed by White with 31,440 or 25 percent.
   Court Clerk Benny Bonanno had 28,268 votes or 23 percent,
Cuyahoga County Commissioner Tim Hagan had 11,799 votes or 9
percent and school board President Ralph J. Perk Jr. had 5,891
votes or 5 percent.

<HEAD>Helms Urges Adding Authorizing Troops in Panama to Drug Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: The Senate will not finish debate tonight, and the following
should stand for AMs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate became snarled late Tuesday in a
fight over whether to authorize the use of U.S. troops against
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, indicted in the United States
on drug trafficking charges, as it debated legislation to bolster
the war on drugs.
   ``We had a golden opportunity to help the people of Panama rid
themselves of a malignancy,'' Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said as he
offered his plan.
   His offering came as senators churned through a wide-ranging
bill that would add hundreds of new agents, federal marshals and
prosecutors to the war on drugs and place care of crack addicts
under the Medicaid program.
   ``These amendments will lay the groundwork for a new, expanded
drug control strategy,'' Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R.
Biden Jr., D-Del., said as the Senate approved the additions.
   Senators planned to put the finishing touches on the bill
Wednesday.
   Helms' proposal would authorize the president to ``use the armed
forces of the United States to secure the removal of General Manuel
Antonio Noriega from his illegal control of the Republic of
Panama.''
   Biden expressed concern about the measure, saying ``I wonder if
it is so broad that we are authorizing the president to declare
war.''
   He said it was possible that ``the Gulf of Tonkin resolution
might blush by comparison.'' The Tonkin resolution of 1965 led to
escalation of the Vietnam War.
   The Noriega proposal followed the failure of a coup attempt
against him by members of the Panama Defense Forces.
   Earlier, the Senate approved drug bill provisions that would
authorize $57 million for 1,000 new FBI agents, $47.5 million for
250 Drug Enforcement agents in rural areas and $24 million for 313
additional posts in federal prosecutors' offices. It also would
authorize more for judges, marshals and probation officers.
   The bill also would place treatment of crack cocaine users and
perhaps other substance abusers under Medicaid, beginning a year
from now, at a cost estimated by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
at $300 million.
   Moynihan, the author of the provision, said the price tag would
be comparatively low because care available for crack addicts is
limited in any case. ``There is no treatment,'' he told reporters.
   The bill was designed to help implement President Bush's war on
drugs. As it went into the hopper, the measure would have required
drug testing of persons arrested, jailed and placed on probation or
paroled.
   A state's failure to satisfy the attorney general about the
extent of its testing program could have led to a cutoff of federal
law enforcement funds.
   The Senate, however, junked those provisions in favor of a plan
by Sen. Christopher Bon, R-Mo., providing for a $5 million pilot
program of testing federal prisoners to determine which procedures
work best. Bond said lawmakers were leery of handing the attorney
general the powers in the original plan.
   Senators worked late into the night, heaping additions of their
own onto the bill, ranging from a study of the possibility of
ending the use of disposable needles to earmarking forfeited drug
funds to buy weapons and body armor for agents.
   ``We'll probably pass a lot of these things and then they will
never see the light of day,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the
GOP floor leader.
   ``The House won't let it happen'' and the Senate itself might
have some second thoughts before final action, Hatch said.

   Items found during in a search of the home
of a man on trial for the rape and sexual mutilation of a
7-year-old boy can be admitted as evidence, a Superior Court judge
ruled Tuesday.
   Earl Shriner, 39, charged with attempted first-degree murder,
first-degree assault and two counts of first-degree rape,
understood his rights when he let police into his home on May 21,
Judge James Healy ruled.
   Shriner, 39, described as mentally retarded man with a history
of sexual violence against young people is charged with the May 20
attack in which the boy was choked, raped and his penis was cut off.
   Officers seized a yellow strap, a piece of braided cord and a
blood-stained jacket from Shriner's home. Investigators said the
strap and cord may have been used to choke or bind the boy.
   Shriner said he bloodied the coat with his own blood when he
scraped his hand after falling off his bicycle.
   In arguments Monday, Shriner's lawyer, Dino Sepe, contended the
items should be withheld from evidence because they were seized
without a search warrant and by coercion.
   Deputy prosecutor Jim Roche argued that Shriner voluntarily
allowed police to search his home and said Shriner was familiar
with such searches from past experiences.
   Shriner, held in lieu of $1 million bond, is scheduled for trial
Jan. 22.

   Clean air legislation is gaining momentum in
the House, following a breakthrough agreement that would apply
California's tough auto tailpipe standards to the whole country
starting with 1994 models.
   The 22-0 vote Monday in the House Energy and Commerce
environment subcommittee came after two powerful lawmakers _ Reps.
Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., and John D. Dingell, D-Mich. _ shook
hands and ended a bitter dispute over the auto standards.
   Waxman, the champion of environmental groups, and Dingell, the
auto industry's best friend in Congress, said Monday they would
oppose any attempts to change the agreement. Their pact virtually
ensures new, tough auto pollution controls because the Senate's
clean air legislation is even stricter than the compromise.
   The auto industry was quick to express its displeasure with the
proposed exhaust standards. Harold A. Poling, chief operating
officer for Ford Motor Co., said the standards ``are not feasible
and ... would improve air quality by less than 1 percent compared
with the president's proposal.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, decrying crippling strikes
that officials say may force some people to brave a winter without
enough heating oil, is urging parliament to vote for a 15-month ban
on strikes.
   The Soviet president made the appeal Monday at the end of a
legislative debate on emergency economic measures proposed by First
Deputy Premier Lev Voronin, the official Tass news agency reported.
   Gorbachev told the legislators to discuss the proposed ban and
be prepared to vote on it today. He called the ban a ``necessary
measure ... to protect democratization from anarchy and
irresponsible management.''
   A key element of Gorbachev's reforms is perestroika, or
restructuring the Soviet's Union's stumbling and shortage-ridden
economy, and the Soviet leader said that economic transformation is
``under threat'' because of strikes.

   A ruling that the funding of Texas schools
is unconstitutional will mean a chance at equality for poorer
districts in the nation's second-largest school system, a lawyer in
the case says.
   The state's education commissioner, who had defended the
financing system, called for a tax increase so poorer districts can
``equalize upward.'' But Gov. Bill Clements said more money won't
necessarily solve the problem.
   Monday's unanimous 9-0 decision by the Texas Supreme Court found
``glaring disparities'' between rich and poor school districts,
violating a requirement in the state Constitution for an
``efficient system'' of public schools.
   The court said financing for Texas' 3.3 million students must be
overhauled by May.

   Five amateur astronomers are preparing for an
undreamed-of opportunity to go eyeball to eyeball with the universe
using what will be the world's most powerful space telescope.
   In a gesture of appreciation for scientific contributions by
hobbyists using backyard and rooftop telescopes, the Space
Telescope Science Institute has offered 20 hours of observing time
on the Hubble Space Telescope to projects designed by amateurs.
   The telescope, to be launched on a space shuttle in March, is a
joint project of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
and the European Space Agency. The project, based at Johns Hopkins
University, is expected to cost about $750 million and has been in
planning stages for a decade.
   For someone who is not a professional astronomer, the odds of
getting to use the telescope are comparable to George Jetson's
chances of getting a raise from his tightfisted boss at Spacely
Sprockets.

<HEAD>Ted Turner's TNT Network Turns One, Still Growing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tonight's ``Big Picture'' is a Montgomery Clift
film, ``The Search,'' made in 1948. Then comes another postwar
film, ``Till the End of Time,'' a 1946 drama with Robert Mitchum
and Dorothy McGuire.
   The Late, Late Show of a local TV station? No.
   It's tonight's prime-time fare on TNT _ which on Tuesday
celebrated its first cable-TV birthday with little hoopla, a record
of solid growth and anticipation of more.
   The brainchild and fourth network of cable wizard Ted Turner,
Turner Network Television arrived on Oct. 3, 1989, its basic fare
classic and maybe-not-so-classic films of yesteryear and
big-budget, made-for-cable movies.
   When it began amid considerable drumbeating and cable's first
showing of ``Gone With the Wind,'' TNT, a 24-hour-a-day operation,
had 17 million subscribers. Now, it says, the figure is up to 33
million.
   TNT isn't yet in the top 10 list of cable networks, a list led
by mostly sports ESPN with more than 52 million subscribers. ``We
still have a way to go to catch up with the leaders,'' concedes
Gerry Hogan, TNT's boss.
   ``But we feel there's plenty of growth left,'' adds Hogan, who
as president of Turner Entertainment Networks is in charge of both
TNT and TBS, the latter Turner's cable superstation in Atlanta.
Turner's other networks are the all-news Cable News Network and
Headline News.
   TNT's made-for-cable movies now include miniseries such as the
just-concluded three-part historical drama, ``Captain Cooke,'' and
last month's four-part ``The Nightmare Years,'' based on CBS
correspondent William Shirer's memoirs about Germany during
Hitler's rise to power.
   Early examples of TNT's ``made-fors,'' as TV movies are called,
included Charlton Heston in ``A Man For All Seasons,'' and a drama
with Farrah Fawcett as the celebrated news photographer Margaret
Bourke-White.
   Costing an average of $3 million each, the movies initially
bowed on a one-a-month basis. The premieres this month went to a
two-a-month basis, and, a spokeswoman says, will go up to three a
month by October next year, and four each month in 1991.
   Although TNT's target audience is in the 25-54 age range, the
network does have younger-viewer fare in the morning and early
evening _ reruns of Jim Henson's acclaimed ``The Muppet Show''
series and ``Fraggle Rock.''
   It also is edging into sports, with more than 70 National
Basketball Association games slotted for this winter. During the
1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, TNT says, it will air 50 live hours
from each Games under a $50 million deal Turner struck last month
with CBS Sports.
   But what Hogan calls ``the heart and soul'' of TNT is its huge
library of MGM, RKO Studios and pre-1950 Warner Bros. films, more
than 3,300 movies that range from ``Casablanca'' to ``The Prisoner
of Zenda.''
   ``We run 250 films a month,'' says Hogan, who praises Lisa
Mateas, TNT's scheduling director, as close to a genius in the way
she schedules the movies, of which new prints have been made and
sound tracks restored.
   Sometimes, he says, she schedules two or three titles together
to show stages of development of a particular player, such as Bette
Davis, or to show a yesteryear star, such as Myrna Loy, to a new
generation of film fans.
   Sometimes her scheduling also displays a pixie sense of humor.
One night last year offered a TNT triple-feature: ``He Couldn't Say
No,'' ``She Couldn't Say No,'' and ``She Had to Say Yes.''
   ``She's just magic,'' Hogan says.
   TNT may be a treasure trove for movie buffs. But the size of its
average audience each night poses no major threat yet to the major
networks.
   Its much-publicized ``Margaret Bourke-White'' last April got
TNT's highest ratings to date, a 5.1. That works out to just over
2.5 million homes, which is very good for cable, but relatively
small potatoes by network standards.
   Still, TNT's growth and acceptance by viewers have impressed
even a top cable executive who once was what he calls a
``nay-sayer'' to TNT, partly because he didn't think its film
library would prove that big a draw.
   ``I thought we should have stayed back and waited a year to see
what happened,'' says Robert Clasen, president of Comcast Cable
Communications, one of the nation's largest cable companies.
   But Comcast, which is based near Philadelphia and, according to
Clasen, serves 2.4 million subscribers, decided to take a chance.
   It offered the new TNT service as part of a promotional strategy
last fall. The network ``was very successful, very well-received''
by subscribers of cable systems Comcast owns or manages, he says.
   He sees little that could stop TNT's growth. He also is, he
says, ``completely sold'' on Turner's long-range goal for the
network: one major event each night that is the centerpiece of the
night's program.
   ``This is the cable era where people don't watch channels
anymore,'' Clasen says. ``They look at individual products. They
want to be sure there's something significant to watch when they
tune in.''

   When the subject of affordable housing is
discussed, which is often, most recommendations offered seem to
involve the federal government in some capacity.
   It is an old tradition, part of the American culture,
exemplified by the Federal Housing Administration and Veterans
Administration mortgage programs, by tax-favored building programs,
and by income tax breaks for homeowners.
   Homeownership is sacred. Ask any homebuilder or real estate
group and they'll claim that homeowners are hardworking, community
spirited, highly responsible, and dutiful voters. And, as they say
in the real estate ads, much, much more.
   Homeowners, they might add, are the embodiment of the American
spirit of independence, creativity and opportunity. A high level of
homeownership, they point out, distinguishes America from so many
other countries.
   But when the subject is affordable housing, many housing people
habitually turn to Washington for a solution, citing figures that
show the typical new house is priced beyond the means of the
typical income family.
   Meanwhile, many young couples are, in effect, saying so what,
and are managing to buy suitable houses by means of old-fashioned
ingenuity, a quality often available to those who need to tap it.
   Among their devices is that of obtaining financial assistance
from the seller. Sellers who have owned their houses for many years
generally have built up sizable equity. They have money to invest.
   Many of them also are contemplating retirement, and wondering
about a retirement income. To extend a purchase loan, a second
mortgage, might be considered an opportunity by them. Both rate and
security are A-1.
   The device is commonly used but not nearly as commonly
recommended. But thousands of young couples are in homes of their
own today because of it. And all they did was ask.
   Others are buying homes in need of repairs. The house isn't the
place of their dreams but, submitting to reality, they recognize it
is the best they can do. They buy, and using brains and backs,
create the house of their dreams.
   In so doing, they create equity too, almost always adding more
to their assets than the couple who postpone buying while
attempting to save enough for a dream house in the future. One
couple has a house, the other a forlorn dream.
   Others tip the price scale in their favor by moving farther out
from core cities, while others push deeper into the cores, even
into slums, in search of prices within their means. It's a start,
they reason. Better times will come.
   Indeed, they usually do. Whatever they manage to buy, assuming
they exercised prudence, the new homeowners are likely to find the
market value higher in the future.
   The increases might be modest, maybe averaging just a few
percentage points a year, but that's better than in most
investments. Homeowners may put up only 20 percent of the purchase
price but they take 100 percent of the appreciation.
   True, prices might stagnate in the future; conceivably, they
could even drop. But over periods of a decade or more it is
relatively rare for houses to lose market value. Real estate is
cyclical, but the price trend is up.
   Houses that couldn't be sold eight years ago in Detroit now
might be available for double their old price. Since 1986, the
median sale price of existing single-family homes there has risen
more than $15,000.
   In Houston, where in middecade the market had dropped
drastically, the median price in the second quarter of 1989 was 8.2
percent higher than a year earlier. Prices are up in San Antonio
again. And in Dallas too.
   And those who scrimped, struggled, sacrificed and innovated in
order to buy those houses are reaping the benefits now, without
help from Uncle Sam.

<DATELINE>SITKA, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The unassuming facade of The Observatory
gave no hint of the significance of what was inside. But like a
good book, Dee Longenbaugh's bookstore could not be judged by its
cover.
   Inside was a collection that had become a treasure to book and
map collectors worldwide. Longenbaugh's specialty is ``Alaskana'' _
books, maps and prints that tell of the Last Frontier's colorful
past.
   The treasure still exists, but not in this scenic fishing port
and mill town along southeast Alaska's rain forest coast. Sitka and
its 8,000 residents recently lost the best collection of literary
Alaskana to Santa Fe, N.M.
   For Longenbaugh, 55, the move south represents a return to her
roots. She grew up in northern New Mexico.
   ``It's very, very interesting, because I have lived in Sitka for
26 years,'' she said. ``So am I still a northern New Mexican? Am I
an Alaskan? Don't know. Gotta go down and find out.''
   Longenbaugh doesn't plan to open her new store until later this
year. But she expects it will offer more space than the cramped
quarters of her Sitka shop, where the lack of order was enough to
make a librarian faint. Thousands of books were crammed on shelves,
stacked on the floor and buried under desks _ everywhere except on
a narrow ribbon of linoleum that snaked through the shop's two
small rooms.
   The hand-printed signs that separated the books by subject did
little to alleviate the disheveled appearance. Longenbaugh's
passion for out-of-print books long ago overcame any passing
interest in library science.
   ``I'm at the other end of the spectrum from the book dealer who
has thousands of volumes and knows where every one is,'' she said
recently before the move.
   Longenbaugh began to turn her love for books and fascination
with polar-region history into a business 13 years ago. Her
children were growing up and she was looking for something fun and
profitable to do with her time.
   She started trading books from her home on a tiny island off
Sitka's waterfront, but soon realized she needed a store. In 1977,
she rented a small house on a back street and converted it into The
Observatory with 343 out-of-print books on Alaska.
   Today she has about 3,000 volumes on Alaska, 6,000 on other
subjects, 2,200 historic prints and maps, and dozens of reference
books. She began trading in maps and prints in 1979 after a buying
trip to England.
   ``I kept noticing in little towns there would be a little print
and map shop,'' she recalled. ``I thought, `Gosh, I wonder if
anybody in Alaska would be interested in old maps of Alaska?'''
   They were. Alaskans comprised about 50 percent of Longenbaugh's
clientele. About 40 percent were from other states and about 10
percent traded from overseas.
   With virtually no advertising, the self-taught
historian-bookseller built an international business. She remains
somewhat perplexed about how she became so well-known among book
and map collectors.
   ``I don't know,'' she said. ``Word of mouth, I think.''
   Although Longenbaugh hopes to ``go upmarket somewhat'' with her
Santa Fe store, she easily resists being stereotyped as a
highfalutin trader of rare books and maps.
   ``On purpose I run a democratic bookstore. My idea is that you
can come into the shop and you may not see anything you like, and
you can leave, but I don't want you to say, `There wasn't anything
in that place I could afford.'
   ``Good reading is good reading,'' she said. ``If it's an old
library discard, that's OK _ the content is still perfectly good
and it's fun to read.''
   Longenbaugh also rejects the notion that booksellers shouldn't
specialize in their favorite subjects.
   ``The rule of thumb goes, you are never, never to deal in a
specialty where you yourself collect, because you will cheat your
customers by grabbing off the good stuff.
   ``My feeling is, if I dealt with something that bored me I
wouldn't enjoy doing it. Sure, I take one now and then. But I
always figure, there's another copy out there. The customer can
have the next one.''
   A friendly woman with a hearty laugh and insatiable curiosity,
she revels in playing detective for customers seeking a particular
out-of-print book.
   ``It's just so much fun,'' she said. ``Lots of dealers don't
like to do book searches because they are so time consuming. I
charge a dollar and a half, and I'm sure I spend a lot more than
that.''
   Her Sitka customers now have to request that service by mail.
They also can no longer hear her classical music show on the local
public radio station, or enjoy her narration of the station's daily
soap opera.
   ``People like Dee are irreplaceable,'' said Jake Schumacher,
program director for KCAW-FM. ``Her particular combination of
personality and talent is something that is rare even in a big
city, let alone in a town our size.''
   Longenbaugh is touched by such sentiment. ``Bless their hearts,
everybody's being really regretful.
   ``And I'm so pleased, because think how horrible it would be to
live in a place so many years and have nobody care when you took
off.''

<HEAD>Bushes Bring Livelier Times to Presidential Retreat</HEAD>

   It's horseshoes instead of horseback riding,
the movies are newer and the guest list is longer as President Bush
settles in at the weekend White House in the Catoctin Mountains of
Maryland.
   In 37 weekends of Bush's presidency, he has been to ``the camp''
20 times. Six weekends have been spent at his oceanfront home in
Maine.
   His stays at Camp David usually begin with a jog, aides say.
   Saturdays will typically include more athletic endeavors _
jogging, tennis, swimming, horsehoe pitching and ``wally ball,'' a
form of vollyeball played on a squash court _ and work in his
office.
   Sundays, he attends interdenominational church services along
with personnel from the camp, which is operated by the Navy.
   Barbara Bush routinely accompanies her husband to the retreat.
   ``She reads a lot, does her mail, takes work with her up
there,'' says Anna Perez, the first lady's press secretary. ``If
her husband is having guests and they bring the spouses along,
which happens quite a bit, she'll maybe go bowling with the
spouses. She always goes swimming when she's up there. They play
tennis. It's a quiet time for her.''
   As was the case when Ronald and Nancy Reagan used the camp,
Friday and Saturday nights are often devoted to films in the camp's
movie theater. The Reagans, with backgrounds in the golden age of
Hollywood, preferred old movies. The Bushes' taste runs to newer
offerings.
   Last weekend, they watched ``Sea of Love'' and ``Shirley
Valentine.''
   Reagan used Camp David 187 times _ more than any other president
since Franklin D. Roosevelt had it built in 1942. Weekends for the
Reagans were usually quiet times spent without family or other
visitors.
   ``It was a place that the Reagans enjoyed to be alone together
and to unwind and to be away from the pressures of the gilded cage
of the White House,'' says Mark Weinberg, a spokesman for the
former president in Los Angeles.
   The Reagans' son, Ron, who visited the camp several times with
his wife, Doria, said the routine was to ``sleep late, depending on
the weather, take a swim, have a ride, come back, hang out and
probably see a movie in the evening after dinner.''
   Reagan's daughter Maureen has said she visited the camp only
once. His other daughter, Patti, was estranged from her parents for
much of the administration.
   Michael Reagan and his wife, Colleen, parents of the Reagans'
only grandchildren, were living in California and did not visit the
camp.
   For the Bushes, in contrast, weekends at Camp David often bring
gatherings of family and friends.
   The first family's newest grandchild, Ashley, came to Camp David
on Easter, less than two months after she was born in Denver to
Neil Bush and his wife, Sharon. The older grandchildren enjoy
riding around the camp in golf carts.
   ``You see grandkids putting around all the time,'' says one aide
who has accompanied the Bushes to the retreat 65 miles northwest of
Washington.
   One weekend, the president invited Pam Shriver and a group for a
weekend of tennis.
   Even foreign dignitaries have spend the night. Prince Charles
was there in February, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke went in
June and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was there last weekend.
   One more thing: There is now a Nintendo game at Camp David.

   The U.S. economy's manufacturing sector remained
weak in September, although orders for exports increased sharply in
spite of a stronger dollar, the nation's corporate purchasing
managers said.
   The Purchasing Managers' Index, a widely watched barometer of
the economy's direction, rose to 46 percent from 45.2 percent in
August and matched the rate for July.
   A reading below 50 percent indicates the manufacturing sector of
the economy is in decline while a reading above 50 percent
indicates growth, according to the National Association of
Purchasing Management, which released the index Monday.

   The Bush administration is putting pressure on
the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but the central bank
will likely resist those efforts and keep rates right where they
are, private economists predicted.
   Policy-makers at the central bank were to meet behind closed
doors today to review the economy's performance and set interest
rate guidelines for the coming weeks. Many private economists said
they believed the Fed is already worrying that its tight monetary
policy will depress economic growth.

   Key House members have broken a decade-long
stalemate over clean air legislation, agreeing to apply
California's strict auto emissions standards to the entire nation,
congressional sources said.
   The sources, speaking only on condition they not be named, said
Monday the compromise would put California's requirements _ the
toughest of all 50 states _ into effect nationwide through 2002.
They could be strengthened starting in 2003.
   The agreement is supported by Reps. John D. Dingell, D-Mich.,
and Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., whose bitter differences over auto
emissions have played a large role in delaying an updating of the
1977 clean air law.

   Zenith Electronics Corp. said it will sell its
fast-growing computer business to France's Groupe Bull and use the
proceeds to pay off debt and sharpen its focus on new video
technology such as high-definition television.
   Zenith is the last major U.S.-based maker of televisions, a
business that generally has been unprofitable in recent years.
Company officials and industry analysts said Monday the deal,
valued at more than $630 million, would give Zenith a solid
financial base for its continuing battle against foreign

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in several
weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.83 percent, up from 7.72 percent
last week. Another $7.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.92 percent, up from 7.79 percent last
week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.88
percent on Sept. 5 and six-month bills averaged 8.08 percent last
June 19.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.10 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,802.10 and 8.36 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,599.60.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 8.38
percent last week, up from 8.18 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Merger Activity Slows in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of mergers and acquisitions in the
United States trailed off during the third quarter, although the
dollar value of those deals was up, according to a financial
research company.
   Securities Data Co. said Mondat that 334 acquisitions of U.S.
companies worth $114.7 billion were announced during the third
quarter. That compared with 357 transactions worth $92.3 billion in
the first quarter, and 378 deals worth $75 billion in the second
quarter.
   Merger and acquisition activity has slowed as prices for
companies has gone up and financing has been harder to come by. The
big banks that finance deals have become more cautious, and
investors are also more wary.
   In reaching its totals, Securities Data included acquisitions of
majority and entire interests in U.S. firms, recapitalizations,
spinoffs, self-tenders and exchange offers for stock or securities
convertible into stock. Each transaction was worth $10 million or
more.
   The figures included several major deals, including the planned
$11.4 billion merger of Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp., the
proposed $3.6 billion acquisition of Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. by Sony Corp. and the planned $4.7 billion
merger of Citizens and Southern Corp. with Sovran Financial Corp.
   They also included the approximately $5.5 billion in
divestitures announced by RJR Nabisco Inc. following its own $24.53
billion buyout earlier this year.
   So far in 1989, there have been 1,140 transactions totaling
$302.5 billion, down 14 percent from the 1,256 deals totaling
$353.1 billion during the first nine months of 1988, according to
Newark, N.J.-based Securities Data.
   The company's figures also indicate a slowing in leveraged
buyouts, those made with largely borrowed funds.
   Leveraged buyouts declined to 24 deals totaling $19.9 billion in
the third quarter, compared with 47 deals worth $18.3 billion in
the first quarter and 56 transactions totaling $19.6 billion in the
second quarter.
   For the year to date, there have been 132 LBOs totaling $57.7
billion, down sharply from 183 buyouts totaling $73.3 billion in
the same period a year earlier.
   LBO activity is expected to continue to decline because of
uncertainty in junk bonds, a popular form of financing for
leveraged buyouts. The junk bond market suffered heavy losses last
month after Campeau Corp. announced it was having difficulty
meeting interest payments on some of its bonds.
   Campeau, which relied heavily on junk bonds for its $6.6 billion
buyout of Federated Department Stores Inc. last year, has received
a $250 million loan from Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. so it
could make its payments.
   IDD Information Services, another financial information concern,
also reported a slowing of merger activity during the first three
quarters of the year.
   IDD, which tallied merger and acquisition activity around the
world, said 3,666 targets worth $248.53 billion were acquired
during the first nine months of 1989, down from 4,171 targets worth
$248.57 billion.
   The company noted that the 1989 dollar amount was swelled by the
RJR Nabisco deal. Without that transaction, the drop in terms of
dollars would have been sharper.

<HEAD>Ford Announces 4.9 Percent Average Price Boost for 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co.'s 1990 model cars will
cost an average of 4.9 percent more than comparably equipped 1989
vehicles, the company announced.
   Ford said Monday that nearly half of the increase _ 2.1 percent
_ was due to government-required passive safety devices, either
driver-side air bags or automatic seat belts.
   General Motors Corp. has announced a 3.4 percent average
increase in the retail prices of its 1990 cars. Chrysler Corp.,
which will announce its figures within two weeks, has estimated its
increase will be about 5 percent.
   Each of the Big Three automakers blamed air bags and automatic
seat belts for large portions of the price increases. All of
Chrysler's U.S.-built cars, about 1 million vehicles, will be
equipped with driver-side air bags. About 500,000 GM cars will have
them and about 1 million Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars will be
equipped with the devices.
   Executives of each of the Big Three have said that air bags add
between $400 and $1,000 to the cost of a car.
   Ford began taking orders on 1990 cars based on pre-introduction
prices set in August. Those who already have ordered 1990 Ford
Thunderbird, Festiva and Tempo and Mercury Cougar and Topaz cars
will get rebates, since the retail price announced Monday is lower
than the pre-introduction prices of those models, spokesman Dave
Krupp said.
   He said other retail prices were the same as pre-introductory
quotes and some were higher. Those customers will not have to pay
more.
   GM, Ford and Chrysler already have announced incentive plans for
some of their 1990 model cars and trucks, which would soften the
impact of the passive restraint systems.

<TEXT>
   The 2,000 employees at Zenith
Electronic Corp.'s successful computer-manufacturing division
weren't surprised when they heard part of the company was being
sold.
   But they were shocked to learn Monday that the division being
sold was their own.
   ``I was surprised because the computer group of Zenith was the
one making the profits for the corporation itself. The other
divisions weren't,'' said Theodore J. Lesauskis, staff
representative for Local 8850 of the United Steelworkers.
   Zenith, based in Glenview, Ill., said it was selling its
personal computer division to Groupe Bull of France to reduce its
debt and focus on new video technologies.
   Groupe Bull said in a statement it planned to keep the Zenith
computer division's headquarters in the United States, with primary
manufacturing and engineering remaining in St. Joseph.
   ``As far as we're concerned, it's business as usual,'' Zenith
spokesman Matt Mirapaul said. ``We expect no major changes.''
   Lesauskis said Zenith officials told him Groupe Bull would pick
up the local's three-year contract, negotiated in July.
   There are about 750 union employees at the plant. About 150 were
laid off last month due to inventory surpluses, but Lesauskis
believes they will be called back if Zenith wins a military
contract on which it is bidding.
   ``The people (employees) are taking a wait-and-see attitude,''
Lesauskis said of the sale, which is subject to shareholder and
regulatory approval.
   ``It might be good. This French company has markets overseas
that might be helpful for the employees and company itself to
expand.''
   Zenith Data Systems is one of the world's leading producers of
laptop computers. It also has a large line of full-size personal
computers. The computer and components portion of the business also
includes the Heath Co.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. says it
has been awarded a patent for superconducting materials and said
separately it had begun shipping a plug-in chip for high-speed
personal computers.
   IBM said Monday its U.S. patent was granted for a group of
superconducting materials that have no resistance to electricity at
temperatures when cooled to 243 degrees below zero Fahrenheit or
colder.
   One of the materials remains superconducting as warm as 234
degrees below zero, which IBM said is still the highest confirmed
transition temperature for any stable superconductor.
   The inventors are Edward M. Engler, Victor Y. Lee, Adel I.
Nazzal and Stuart S.P. Parkin, who work at IBM's Almaden Research
Center in San Jose, Calif. They reported their work in February
1988 and the patent was issued on Sept. 26 of this year.
   The plug-in chip is Intel Corp.'s i486 microprocessor, the
fastest available for IBM-style personal computers. It comes on a
``power platform'' that IBM said could plug into one of its
personal computers in place of the existing microprocessor.
   IBM had promised delivery of the plug-in chip by the end of the
year. It said it had installed the first one at Continental Bank
Corp. in Chicago.

<HEAD>SEC Alleges Former Merrill Broker Bilked $500,000 From Customers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
charged a a former Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. stockbroker with bilking
more than $500,000 from customers to pay off gambling debts and
fatten his personal account.
   The civil lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court claims
that Marc Stuart Weiner deposited $99,000 in clients' money into
his own bank account and the rest into the accounts of nine other
people from April 1986 to July 1987.
   One alleged fraud involved $200,000 from an elderly widow the
SEC said represented the proceeds from the sale of her home. The
lawsuit claims Weiner invested only $80,000 of the woman's money
and told her the remaining $120,000 was safely invested, despite
discrepancies on her account statement.
   According to the lawsuit, Weiner deposited $131,000 into three
accounts to satisfy gambling debts. The SEC said it is unaware of
reasons for the remaining deposits.
   Weiner, 28, worked at a Queens, N.Y., office of Merrill Lynch
from June 1983 to August 1987 and at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. from August 1987 to April 1988, the lawsuit states. None of
the allegedly fraudulent transactions occurred while Weiner worked
at Prudential-Bache.
   The lawsuit states that Weiner misappropriated an estimated
$503,000 from customer accounts and seeks the full amount to be
reimbursed.
   According to the complaint, Weiner received individual orders
ranging from $3,000 to $120,000 for basic brokerage accounts that
included a choice of money funds and a checking account and bank
card.
   The SEC charged that Weiner simply did not open accounts for
customers who gave him money and deposited checks into his own or
other accounts. In some cases, he allegedly debited customer margin
accounts to account for transactions.
   Merrill Lynch spokesman Fred Yager said the firm discovered
discrepancies in Weiner's accounts after he left the firm and
reported them to the SEC, criminal agencies and Prudential-Bache.
Yager said all Merrill Lynch clients were reimbursed for losses.
   A telephone message left for a Marc Weiner in Brooklyn was not
immediately returned.
   The SEC names the allegedly defrauded clients as well as the
alleged recipients of their money, including those Weiner allegedly
paid off gambling debts.

<HEAD>Say Consumer Confidence Stabilized in September After August Retreat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. consumer confidence in the economy steadied
last month after dropping sharply in August, the Conference Board
said in a survey that suggested a recession is unlikely for the
forseeable future.
   The business research organization's Consumer Confidence Index
totaled 115.4 in September, the same as a month earlier, the group
said Monday. The July figure was 120.4.
   The index, covering 5,000 households nationwide, is a
measurement of consumer trust in the economic future, based on
buying plans, job availability and general business conditions. It
is based on a 1985 base year of 100.
   ``The sustained high level of public confidence, despite some
indications that business activity may be slowing, is
encouraging,'' Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's
Consumer Research Center, said in a press release.
   ``Recent consumer survey findings do not show the slightest
signs of recession,'' he said. ``The strong employment situation,
the benign pace of inflation, and receding interest rates add up to
a comfortable economic environment for the consumer.''
   The survey showed that nearly 27 percent of respondents thought
business conditions were good, roughly the same as a month earlier.
But opinion on job availability declined, with 30 percent of
respondents describing employment as plentiful, vs. 31.6 percent in
August and about 33 percent in July.
   Homebuying plans declined slightly in September, with 2.9
percent of respondents saying they intended to purchase a home, vs.
3.5 percent a month earlier.
   But plans to purchase cars rose to 7.8 percent of respondents,
vs. 7.4 percent in August, 7.1 percent in July and 6.7 percent in
June.
   Consumer behavior is scrutinized by forecasters because it can
provide important evidence on the direction of the economy.
Consumerism accounts for a majority of U.S. economic activity.
   The Conference Board is a worldwide business network of
companies from more than 50 countries, based in New York.

<HEAD>Group Buys 6.24 Percent Stake in Motorcycle Maker</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investor group says it had bought a 6.24
percent stake in Harley-Davidson Inc., the motorcycle manufacturer
that used protective tariffs in the early 1980s to beat back
Japanese competition.
   In a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Malcolm I. Glazer, a Rochester, N.Y, investor and businessman, said
he had purchased 488,200 shares, or 5.7 percent of Harley's common
stock.
   The filing also stated that Glazer's six children _ Avram,
Bryan, Darcie, Edward, Joel and Kevin Glazer _ each controlled
8,500 shares of Harley for a family total of 6.24 percent.
   Glazer last year acquired 9.9 percent in the Formica Corp. at
$12 a share and was rebuffed in a $20-a-share buyout offer before
the laminated products company went private in a management-led
deal for $19 a share.
   ``We invest in companies which we feel are significantly
undervalued, are leaders in their field, have strong brand name
recognition and exhibit tremendous future growth potential,''
Glazer said in a statement. ``Harley- Davidson fits all these
categories.''
   Glazer is chairman of First Allied Corp., which he said has
interests in more than 30 companies in 12 states, including
network-affiliated television stations, real estate, health care
and banking, with assets of more than $200 million.
   First Allied in 1984 offered $7.6 billion to buy Consolidated
Rail Corp., or Conrail, Glazer said.
   The SEC filing on Harley said the Glazer group had ``no
definitive plans at this time'' for their shares but ``are
currently evaluating their respective positions.''
   The filing, however, said they may seek to acquire a controlling
interest or sell off all or part of their shares.
   Harley stock fell 50 cents to $39.12{ in New York Stock Exchange
trading Monday.
   Milwaukee-based Harley, the producer of big, distinctive
motorcycles featured in such movies as ``Easy Rider'' and favored
by many law enforcement agencies, is the only U.S.-based motorcycle
manufacturer.
   The Reagan administration in 1983 imposed five years of stiff
tariffs against imported motorcycles that had been beating Harley's
own product. The tariffs were removed in 1987 after the company
announced it no longer needed the protection.
   ``In the early '80s, the company was being badly beaten by the
Japanese,'' Glazer said. ``Today, however, the Harley factory can't
produce enough motorcycles to meet the overwhelming consumer
demand.''
   Harley reported second-quarter profits of $10.9 million, or
$1.26 a share, on sales of $234 million.
   The filing listed the occupation of Darcie and Edward Glazer as
students while their brothers were listed as ``assistant to Malcolm
I. Glazer.''
   The filing said Malcolm Glazer personally purchased 409,800
shares for $13.7 million _ $3.47 million of it from his personal
funds. Another $376,000 was obtained through a loan from Chemical
Bank that has since been paid.
   The rest of the money to buy the stock, $10.3 million, ``is
expected to be obtained through a combination of Mr. Glazer's
personal funds and a loan or loans from Chemical'' under terms
similar to the previous promissory note Glazer signed.
   The younger Glazers bought their shares for totals ranging from
$234,572 to $235,697, all financed by loans from Chemical,
according to the filing.
   The three companies purchased the remainder of the stock through
a combination of working capital and Chemical loans.

<HEAD>Former Congressman Coelho Takes Job With New York Banking Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Tony Coelho, the California
Democrat who resigned his congressional seat in June amid
allegations of financial impropriety, says he is joining a New York
investment banking firm.
   Coelho's appointment as a partner in the firm Wertheim, Schroder
and Co. was announced Monday in New York by James A. Harmon,
chairman and chief executive officer of the firm, which also has
offices in Tokyo and London.
   The former majority whip, Coelho was the No. 3 leadership
official in the House. He announced his resignation May 26 after it
was revealed he had failed to report a $50,000 loan from a savings
and loan whose chief executive had set him up in a junk bond deal
financed by the loan.
   Coelho maintains that the deal was proper and that his only
mistake had been an accounting oversight.
   But the resulting controversy threatened to damage his run for
majority leader, the No. 2 House post, and he stepped down
effective June 15 rather than subject his party to further ethics
problems.
   ``I don't know the business,'' Coelho said of his new job, but
added: ``I'm excited because it gives me an opportunity to grow.''
   Coelho said he would be working in the areas of mergers and
acquisitions and asset managment in the company's foreign
operations, offering strategic advice and pursuing new clients for
the firm. Current clients include Warner Communications, Revlon
Group and Southern Pacific Transportation Corp.
   ``They were interested in my ability to make strategic
decisions, which can be applied in business as well as in
government and politics,'' Coelho said.
   He will not do any lobbying for the company, Coelho said,
although he plans to continue personal support for legislation to
help disabled Americans. Coelho is an epileptic.
   He plans also to serve on the boards of several corporations and
to teach university classes occasionally, Coelho said.

<HEAD>Ability of Typical American Family to Buy a Home Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An index measuring the ability of the typical
American family to buy a home rose in August to the highest level
in four months, a housing industry group said.
   The National Association of Realtors said Monday its index rose
to 102.2, meaning that a family with a median income of $32,992 had
102.2 percent of the income needed to buy a median-priced existing
home costing $94,900.
   The association said the increase reflects both falling home
prices and mortgage interest rates.
   It was the highest level since the index read 103.2 in April.
   The median means that half of the families earn more and half
less, or that half the homes sell for more and half for less.
   The NAR said the median price for existing homes fell from
$96,700, while interest rates dropped from 10.39 percent to 10.11
percent. It also said a $116 increase in the median income also
helped raise the index.
   The association uses a composite rate reflecting both fixed-rate
and adjustable-rate mortgages.
   The changes lowered the monthly principal and interest payment
on a median home by $29 to $672, which represents 24.5 percent of
the median family's income.
   By region, the median family in the Midwest had 134.4 percent of
the income needed to purchase a median-priced home; Southern
families had 101.3 percent; Western families, 75.0 percent, and
residents of the Northeast, 72.5 percent.
   Realtors President Ira Gribin said that while the index reflects
improved overall buying conditions, it masks the difficulty
first-time buyers continue to experience.
   ``In expensive areas, home prices are so out of sync with
incomes that renters with no equity are pushed out of the buying
market,'' he said.

<UNK>Branson Sells 25 Percent of Music Group to Japanese Company</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entrepreneur Richard Branson says he has sold a 25
percent stake in his Virgin Music Group to Fujisankei
Communications Group of Japan for $150 million.
   The stake would be the largest holding by a Japanese company in
an existing British concern, Virgin Music said.
   The announcement Monday followed last week's news that Columbia
Pictures Entertainment Corp. of the United States agreed to be
acquired by Sony Corp. of Japan for $3.4 billion. It also marks a
trend of corporate takeovers in the U.S. entertainment industry,
especially by foreign firms.
   Virgin Music and the media conglomerate Fujisankei, through its
subsidiary Pony Canyon Inc., plan to launch a new record label in
Japan to promote sales of top British pop artists in the Far East.
   Virgin Music's lineup includes singers Mike Oldfield, Phil
Collins, Peter Gabriel, Keith Richards, Simple Minds, Human League,
UB40 and Boy George, many of them already popular in Japan.
   ``We could not have hoped for a better partner than Fuji,''
Branson said. ``They don't think just short term.''
   Virgin Music ``consciously chose a partnership which would not
only ensure our future independence under existing management, but
would provide a springboard for our ambitions to become the world's
No. 1 music group,'' he said.
   Branson took Virgin Music private last year, saying he wasn't
happy with the stock market's valuation of the shares, which were
sold to the public in 1986.
   Virgin Music had revenue of $400 million in 1988, making it the
sixth largest record company in the world, the company said.
   Branson also owns Virgin Atlantic Airways, a cut-rate
trans-Atlantic airline.
   Virgin is the latest of independent record labels to be snapped
up recently by big corporations, following a trend in the music,
film and television business.
   Dutch-owned Polygram currently is in talks to purchase Los
Angeles' A&amp;M Records, Herb Alpert's label, for a reported $500
million.
   In other deals in recent years, MCA Records bought Motown
Records for $61 million and Thorn-EMI of Great Britain paid about
$80 million for a 50 percent stake in Britain's Chrysalis Records.
   The consolidation trend intensified this summer when Philips'
Polygram Records unit bought independent Island Records for what
analysts estimated was $300 million.
   A still-independent major label belongs to David Geffen. But it
is closely allied with Time-Warner Inc.'s record unit, which was
one of the chief attractions in Time Inc.'s $14 billion merger with
Warner in July.
   Among big labels, CBS Records was snapped up by Sony Corp. and
RCA Records was bought by Bertelsman AG of West Germany.
   Bucking the trend was MCA Records chief Irving Azoff, who
announced in August he was leaving MCA to start his own label. MCA
is negotiating with Azoff to help fund the deal in a setup like the
Geffen's with Warner.
   Azoff estimated it would take $75 million to $100 million in
funding to launch an independent record label, and said all five
competing U.S. record distributors and several Wall Street
investment groups have expressed interest in bankrolling him should
the deal with MCA fail.

   His clients' industries read like an
environmental hit list: nuclear energy, chemicals, hazardous waste
disposal and lawn care.
   It's not surprising that Bruce McCarthy has made a big business
out of crisis public relations.
   Companies that have turned to him for help include W.R. Grace &amp;
Co., Borden Inc.'s chemical division and Chemlawn Corp.
   He helped Kemper Insurance pull out of the highly regulated
Massachusetts auto insurance market without incurring fines. And he
represents New Hampshire Yankee, operator of the troubled,
overbudget Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant.
   McCarthy's first job, of course, is to help such clients avoid
debacles in the first place.
   ``We tell them, `You live in a fishbowl today, and you have to
expect everything you do and say is going to land on the front page
of your newspaper,''' he said. ``You're not going to be able to go
back to your boardroom and communicate with no one but your
shareholders. Those days are gone.'''
   So when oil spills, radiation leaks or regulatory agencies
sting, when government inspectors arrive to seize files and
reporters descend to put tales of corporate wrongdoing on Page One,
McCarthy provides damage control.
   He prescribes an old-fashioned remedy newly in vogue in
crisis-management public relations: Tell all. Apologize if
necessary. Make amends before the government and the courts make
them for you.
   ``Full disclosure is where it's at,'' McCarthy said
recently.``Drench any kind of a crisis and any kind of a difficult
story in information. Get it all out very quickly, and assume it's
all going to come out in the end.''
   He argues that stonewalling only encourages reporters to dig for
themselves, with help from the corporation's foes. If a company
gets the facts out fast, the media will quickly lose interest in
the story.
   McCarthy's nemesis is the corporate attorney.
   When disaster strikes, attorneys frequently counsel executives
to say as little as possible and especially not to apologize, lest
those statements be used against them in a liability suit.
   ``Often times the attorney wins, and that leads to negative
stories that run on for days,'' said McCarthy, 54, who cut his
teeth in public relations as a utility company spokesman during the
Arab oil embargo. ``Then eventually the company relents and decides
to open up. But by that time so much damage has been done and they
are so defensive that it usually works against them.''
   Advice costs $50 to $200 an hour at McCarthy's 5-year-old BMC
Strategies Inc. in the Boston suburb of Lexington.
   Though he has been successful, his staff of 30 is up against
tough competitors, including major law firms with more specializing
in ``governmental relations.'' That can mean anything from lobbying
lawmakers to negotiating with regulatory agencies to running
interference with the media.
   William Weld, former head of the U.S. Justice Department's
criminal division, has launched a unit within the Boston law firm
of Hale &amp; Dorr representing companies or individuals who find
themselves the targets of white collar crime investigations.
   Weld agreed that candor usually pays. But he said he would
advise the company to meet privately with government officials
first.
   ``The worst thing, I think, for a company in trouble to do is
for the CEO to go public and declare, `We are blameless,' and then
be left twisting in the wind as three weeks of negative details
come out,'' Weld said.
   But, he warned, ``You don't want to take a shot into the unknown
and make a statement which is essentially a guilty plea toward a
felony without having some notion of what the government attitude
is likely to be.''
   Kate McDonough, managing director of the Adams &amp; Rinehart public
relations agency in New York, said the way a company responds to a
crisis can influence prosecutor, judge and jury.
   ``Did the company try to cover up or did it act responsibly?
Those are issues that are legitimately put before the court,''
McDonough said.
   Whether the public approves of a company's response to a
disaster can affect the bottom line just as much as a lawsuit, she
added.
   Because of Johnson &amp; Johnson's quick, candid and aggressive
response to the Tylenol poisonings a few years ago, the market
share of the painkiller actually increased after the incident, she
said. But Exxon Corp., widely faulted for its response to the
Valdez oil spill, was threatened with a consumer boycott.

   Zenith Electronics Corp. is returning to its
consumer-electronics roots with the proposed sale of its computer
unit, but the future of the last major U.S.-based television maker
remains fuzzy.
   Both the North American television market and the stock market
appear to be friendly toward Zenith at the moment.
   But experts say there are no guarantees that the high-definition
television technologies to which Zenith is committed will ever find
a large market, or that Zenith will be able to survive in a sea of
hungry foreign competitors.
   ``It's a good company but it's not a good business,'' said James
Magid, an electronics-industry analyst with the New York investment
firm Needham &amp; Co. Inc.
   Glenview-based Zenith announced Monday it had agreed to sell its
computer unit to France's Groupe Bull and would use the proceeds to
lighten its debt load and sharpen its focus on new television
technology.
   The decision surprised some observers, since the company had
long been rumored to be seeking a buyer for its
consumer-electronics unit, by far the weaker of Zenith's two major
divisions.
   But Zenith received only fire-sale prices for its television
business, so it decided to sell its computer division instead,
which makes personal and laptop models, Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman
told a news conference Monday in New York.
   ``We are a highly leveraged company in two very tough
businesses,'' he said. ``We couldn't do either of them appropriate
justice.''
   Zenith's stock surged $3.25 to close at $17.25 a share Monday on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Pearlman and industry analysts said the deal, valued at more
than $600 million, would give Zenith a solid financial base from
which to continue battling foreign competitors.
   Pearlman estimated Zenith's total debt at $600 million. He said
Zenith will pay down all its short-term debt and a portion of its
long-term debt with the money from the sale, leaving it with less
than $50 million in proceeds to be used for other things.
   In a statement, Zenith said it would use some of the cash from
the sale to fund work on ``new consumer electronics and component
technologies, particularly high-definition television and advanced
high-resolution color displays.''
   Analysts said high-definition television, which produces much
sharper pictures than today's television screens, is something of a
gamble given the unknown size of the market.
   ``HDTV is only one piece _ a futuristic piece _ of the consumer
electronics pie,'' said analyst Laura Lederman of Duff &amp; Phelps
Inc. in Chicago. ``And it's a piece of pie that hasn't even been
baked yet.''
   Faced with the possibility of a foreign onslaught of HDTV sets,
the Commerce Department proposed last year that the government take
a major role in HDTV research in this country.
   But the Bush administration now considers HDTV just one of
several telecommunications technologies worthy of federal support,
said Eileen Dougherty, a spokeswoman for the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration.
   Ms. Dougherty denied any reduction in the administration's
commitment to assist HDTV's development.
   ``There may appear to be less of a commitment only because HDTV
is now being considered along with the broader issue of
telecommunications,'' she said.
   Another Zenith technology, the flat-tension-mask video monitor,
is the industry standard in the portable computer field, analysts
said, and would represent a significant improvement in television
picture quality if it could be enlarged, with or without
accompanying HDTV components.
   Zenith envisions the flat tension mask as one component of an
HDTV system.
   The deal to sell the computer division, which is subject to
shareholder and regulatory approval, was seen as a coup for
Paris-based Bull, which will acquire Zenith's successful and highly
regarded SupersPort line of laptop computers as part of the
purchase.
   The 10-year-old computer division, which employs 4,000 of
Zenith's 37,000 workers, has been a bright performer for Zenith
during a decade that proved disastrous to the U.S. television
industry.
   But television prices stabilized this year, halting an
eight-year slide, and are expected to rise next year, due in part
to a shortage of glass for picture tubes.
   Meanwhile, Zenith's computer sales have begun to sag.
   Last month, the company announced it was deferring employee
raises as part of a cost-cutting program to combat losses from
slack computer sales.
   Zenith turned a profit of $11.7 million last year after three
years of widening losses, but had a net loss of $17 million for the
first half of 1989.

   House leaders say the angry reaction of senior
citizens toward the Medicare catastrophic illness plan will push
Congress away from addressing the major health needs of the
elderly, perhaps for years.
   Catastrophic illness protection was considered one of the major
achievements of President Reagan's second term. But elderly groups
have mobilized their members against it and the House was on the
brink of voting a repeal today.
   Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Monday there was a ``mood
of frustration'' among House members. Most would want to let the
dust settle before embracing any new comprehensive plans to provide
catastrophic illness insurance or long-term care, he said.
   ``I think they (lawmakers) feel they'd just like to get rid of
this annoyance and they certainly are going to be very skeptical
when I come to them in the future with a bill to help the senior
citizens,'' said Rep. Fortney Stark, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Ways and Means subcommittee on health.
   Stark and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., were asking the House
today to approve an amendment that would salvage a portion of the
health program's benefits, including some coverage for prescription
drugs. Stark said his chances, at best, were even.
   Stark said supporters of the catastrophic care program ``lost
the information battle'' to groups that preyed on the fears of the
elderly. Many elderly were led by ``hysteria-mongers'' to believe
their costs were astronomical and chances of benefits unlikely, he
said.
   ``It's very easy to take very fragile, very insecure seniors who
are easily confused and confuse them even further,'' he said.
   While the Bush administration has officially endorsed keeping
the program, the president has avoided personal involvement with
that politically unpopular stance. House Republicans have announced
they will vote in a bloc to kill the plan, and say they have
assurances Bush would sign a repeal.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday the White
House position was ``to retain the benefits and mitigate the
premium costs'' but it wasn't endorsing any specific proposal.
   Foley said the House Democratic leaders weren't taking an
official stance either, although he personally supported the
Stark-Waxman approach.
   ``If it is going to be meaningful up here, there must be some
effort on the part of the president to persuade the members to cast
their votes'' against repeal, he said.
   ``If he (Bush) did half as much as he did on capital gains tax
we'd have a real zinger tomorrow,'' Stark said, referring to the
president's victory last week on his tax cut proposal.
   Foley, while critical of the president for sitting out the
controversy on catastrophic health care, said he wasn't sure the
White House could turn the tide at this point.
   The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act was aimed at protecting
the elderly and disabled from financial ruin in the event of a
prolonged hospital stay or other high medical costs.
   The program pays for unlimited approved hospitalization after a
once-a-year deductible of $560 in 1989. Previously, Medicare
charged a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and
provided full payment of hospital bills only up to 59 days a year.
   The plan also limits the amount that beneficiaries must pay for
hospital care, physician services, medical supplies and
prescription drugs and expands other health care benefits as well.
   But the elderly, many of whom had some similar benefits from
private insurance plans, objected to paying for the new federal
coverage. The surtax could be as high as $800 this year and higher
in the future for upper-income elderly.

   Northwest Airlines will be bigger and its
employees more personable in five years if its new owners
accomplish their goals.
   ``Personal relations of our people with the passengers is what's
going to be the biggest difference,'' said Alfred Checchi, who led
a $3.65 billion buyout of Northwest's parent company in June and
replaced Steven Rothmeier as chairman last week.
   ``If you can move a few (market) share points to your aircraft
you really drive the economics of this business,'' he said.
   Checchi and Northwest President Frederic Malek said Monday that
the timing of Rothmeier's resignation was a mild surprise. But they
said his departure was not altogether unexpected given that the
43-year-old Rothmeier is a relatively young executive who was not
accustomed to reporting to a group of private investors.
   ``He made it clear from the very first day he would be assessing
the situation,'' Checchi said. ``A man like Steve undoubtedly has a
lot of options.''
   Rothmeier's three top officers also resigned last week, but
Malek and Checchi said they do not expect other executives to leave
NWA Inc. Malek, one of the investors in the NWA buyout, said he has
met individually with about 30 Northwest executives and discussed
possible pay raises.
   ``We believe we have the enthusiastic participation from
everyone who is left,'' Malek said.
   Neither Checchi nor Malek has airline experience and the two
former Marriott Corp. officers said they are relying heavily on the
experience of senior employees.
   In a wide-ranging, 90-minute news conference Monday, the two men
said:
   _Management will consider selling stock to employees and
possibly making Northwest a public company again through a public
stock sale if the money is needed for expansion or other reasons.
   _Northwest is within weeks of announcing a purchase of new
airplanes. Checchi and Malek did not identify the companies they
are negotiating with or how much money they intend to spend.
   _The airline intends to expand its Pacific Rim routes and its
domestic flight schedule, a move that could require additional
financing.
   _The airline is evaluating 15 to 20 proposals to develop its
land in Japan, which some analysts have said could fetch up to $500
million if sold. Checchi said the proposed deals would ``improve
the property'' and ``liberate'' cash. He said one of the proposals
will be chosen during the first three months of next year.
   _James Cronin, hired last week as executive vice president, is
exploring the possibility of starting an airplane leasing
subsidiary for Northwest.
   Checchi and Malek said their chief concern is to make Northwest
the airline of choice for business and leisure travelers. Northwest
does not now enjoy that status, they said.
   After Northwest acquired Republic Airlines in 1986 for $884
million, performance at the nation's fourth-largest carrier
suffered. Late arrival and baggage complaints were common as
management was slow in bringing former Republic workers up to par
in pay with their Northwest counterparts.
   ``We are in the fortuante position that the hard work from that
acquisition is virtually complete,'' Checchi said.
   Checchi said he will spend most of the next year meeting with
Northwest employees around the globe to boost morale and tap the
workers for ideas. He said he wants to give autonomy to managers at
``the lowest levels of the hierarchy'' as part of his philosophy of
decentralized decision-making.
   The two stressed that they do not view themselves as interim
managers.
   ``We are operating executives who have taken a long-term point
of view,'' said Malek, a finalist in December 1987 for the top job
at United Airlines.
   Said Checchi: ``This has got to be the most exciting industry in
the world. I mean, it is fun.''
   Checchi said he has not decided how to replace $230 million in
equity that belongs to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner ordered Northwest to reduce KLM's
investment in the buyout by that much to reduce concerns about
foreign ownership of U.S. airlines.

   Hong Kong has withstood economic damage from the
June crackdown on China's democracy movement, though it is facing a
serious problem in building confidence in the capitalist British
territory that reverts to Chinese rule in seven years, its
financial secretary says.
   ``I am not going to tell you that we have no problems in Hong
Kong and that everything is as right as rain,'' Sir Piers Jacobs
said Monday in a speech to the Asia Society in New York, where he
was visiting business executives and bankers.
   But, Jacobs said: ``I have every reason to believe that Hong
Kong will come out of recent events fitter and more vigorous than
before. Ours is a city of survivors well used to living on the
edge.''
   Thousands of Hong Kong residents have sought to leave the
capitalist territory adjoining southern China since the violent
military suppression of a student-led democracy drive three months
ago in Beijing. By some estimates, emigration will rise 25 percent
next year to 55,000.
   The Chinese Communist government's handling of the crackdown
suggested to many would-be Hong Kong emigrants that it will violate
an agreement to preserve Hong Kong's capitalist way of life for 50
years beyond the takeover in 1997.
   The rising number of people seeking sanctuary abroad has
depressed Hong Kong stocks and property values, caused a
``brain-drain'' in many industries and raised pressure on Britain
to provide refuge for those who want to leave.
   Moreover, unease about Hong Kong's future has spread increasing
doubts about the territory's role as one of the most dynamic and
productive economic centers of Asia.
   As part of his argument to dispel these doubts, Jacobs carried a
list of 20 major international investments in Hong Kong since the
crackdown in Tiananmen Square.
   Among them are a $667 million Citicorp loan for a high-rise
office complex in which the U.S. bank will retain a 10 percent
stake; a $1.34 billion loan from a consortium of banks to finance
expansion of Hong Kong's container port; a commitment from Walt
Disney to base its Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong; and an
agreement by Mobil Corp. to double its oil-terminal capacity there.
   ``What has been the effect on our economy of the recent events
in China and in particular Tiananmen Square? Surprisingly perhaps,
the answer is not very great,'' Jacobs said.
   He said although the emigration of talented professionals was
regrettable, ``there can be absolutely no question of our impeding
their departure in any way whatsoever. What we have to do is to
provide the right sort of environment to persuade people to stay or
even to encourage them to return.''
   The finance official was in the United States for talks with
international bankers and business executives. American companies
historically have been the biggest foreign investors in Hong Kong
and their role there is deemed crucial for the territory to thrive.

<HEAD>IBM, Cray, Motorola Announce Job Reductions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp., Cray Research Inc. and
Motorola Inc. have announced plans to eliminate the jobs of
hundreds of workers each to cut costs.
   IBM said Monday it is offering special payments to people who
quit or retire at four locations, a step that is expected to cut
600 to 1,000 jobs.
   The job cuts, which are voluntary, represent less than half of 1
percent of IBM's U.S. work force of 223,000.
   The four locations are Owego, N.Y., and Manassas, Va., where IBM
makes specialized equipment for defense contracts; Endicott, N.Y.,
where it makes the 9370 line of minicomputers; and Lexington, Ky.,
where it makes typewriters and printers.
   Most of the people who will be offered the special payments are
in administrative and support areas, IBM spokesman John Reilly
said. They will be given a bonus of one week's pay for each six
months they have worked for IBM, up to a maximum of one year's pay.
   IBM spokesman Peter Thonis said the cost of the cuts would not
significantly hurt the company's profits. He said the cuts were not
related to a slowdown in sales of products made at the four
locations.
   Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola Inc. announced Monday a plan to
reduce its 105,000-employee work force by about 2,500 positions,
primarily salaried jobs at its U.S. plants.
   ``We've improved our normal voluntary severance package,'' said
Motorola spokesman Chuck Sengstock. ``Those applying who are
accepted will now receive two weeks' severance pay for each year of
service.''
   Sengstock said most of those being urged to take the severance
package work in the electronics company's communications and
semiconductor products groups.
   If not enough workers take the severance package, there may be
layoffs, said Sengstock.
   The company said a pretax provision of about $43 million to
cover the cost of the severance program would be reflected in
third-quarter earnings to be announced next week.
   Motorola President George Fisher said the program ``simply
reflects what we at Motorola consider to be good and prudent
management and provides a means for us to reduce our cost base.''
He said the company was not predicting an earnings downturn.
   The package will be offered to workers at selected Motorola
facilities until about mid-November, Sengstock said. He mentioned
plants in Chicago; Phoenix; Austin, Texas; Fort Worth, Texas; Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.; and Boynton Beach, Fla., as among the facilities
where salaried employees would be encouraged to take severance.
   Cray Research, one of the world's largest supercomputer
manufacturers, announced Monday it is laying off 400 employees at
two Wisconsin plants.
   The layoffs are due to a failure to meet sales projections and
the fact that fewer employees are needed to manufacture today's
supercomputer systems, the Minneapolis-based company said. Cray
said it has essentially completed the transition from the Cray X-MP
system to the more advanced Cray Y-MP product line.
   Cray has about 5,400 employees worldwide.
   The company said all costs associated with the manufacturing
work force reduction would be incurred in 1989, and are expected to
total about $3 million.
   Cray said it was eliminating 280 jobs at Chippewa Falls and 120
at its Rice Lake plant.
   The company offered full salary to the end of year for any
employees who left voluntarily at the end of the month. Any layoffs
will be based on seniority, Cray said.
   Workers who lose their jobs would also get $4,000 in education
grants, the company said.

<HEAD>Sony Chairman Stresses Columbia Management Will Remain American</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The management of Columbia Pictures Entertainment
Inc. will remain American even after the company is acquired by
Sony Corp. for $3.4 billion, Sony Chairman Akio Morita said Tuesday.
   Morita said Sony will leave filmmaking decisions to American
managers just as it has left day-to-day management of CBS Records,
which it acquired in 1987, to local executives. Industry analysts
say Sony has taken a hands-off approach to running CBS Records, the
world's largest music company.
   ``Columbia Pictures and CBS Records will remain in the hands of
American management,'' Morita told a news conference.
   ``We manage our subsidiaries as autonomous businesses and though
we provide financial backing we give complete autonomy and make a
business environment where local people can do creative work.''
   On Tuesday, Coca-Cola Co.'s board of directors gave formal
approval to the sale of the company's 53.8 million shares of
Columbia Pictures to Sony USA Inc., a subsidiary of Sony, at $27 a
share.
   With that completed, Morita said, Sony's tender offer for the
shares would begin Wednesday.
   Morita said Sony has ``no immediate plans'' to send Japanese
executives to work at Columbia, and said his company would work to
allay fears of a ``Japanese invasion.''
   Some Americans have expressed concern that Sony may use its
ownership for ``propaganda'' purposes or may censor films critical
of Japan. Congresswoman Helen Delich Bentley has called for an
investigation into whether Sony's takeover of Columbia will reduce
competition, thereby violating anti-trust laws, Kyodo News Service
reported.
   Critics in both Japan and the United States have raised fears
that the takeover may increase friction at a time when a $50
billion bilateral trade imbalance and rapidly increasing Japanese
investment in the United States are raising economic tensions.
   ``I think it's too bad such concerns have been raised,'' Morita
said.
   He stressed that the takeover was a friendly one welcomed by
Columbia and said he expected the relationship would follow the
pattern of Sony's buyout of CBS Records.
   ``In the United States I spoke with CBS Records executives and
they said `Thank you very much for buying us' and I was very happy
when I heard that,'' Morita said. ``We worked hard to make a good
working environment and they're completely satisfied.''
   Morita said he hoped that rather than increasing friction,
Sony's management of U.S. entertainment firms would set a good
example.
   ``If we ... show the acquisition of Columbia is a success for
its American employees, we can remove apprehensions and concerns
and Americans may no longer feel Japanese are strangers or can't be
understood,'' Morita said.
   He said recent takeovers by non-Japanese firms have not raised
as many fears among Americans. Australian-born media tycoon Rupert
Murdoch bought 20th-Century Fox, and the Australian firm Qintex
Entertainment recently purchased MGM-UA Communications with less
press attention than the Sony buyout.

<HEAD>USX Puts TXO Reserves on Block</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. could get $1.5 billion for the
natural gas and oil reserves it has offered for sale through its
Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. subsidiary, Wall Street analysts said.
   A sale would leave Texas Oil with its biggest business _ gas
gathering _ still intact, but would eliminate a business that one
analyst said was draining the subsidiary.
   ``I estimate that TXO's producing properties are losing $30
million to $40 million per year on an operating basis,'' said David
N. Fleischer of Prudential Bache Securities.
   The Pittsburgh-based steel and energy giant said it would use
the proceeds from the sale to reduce its $5.8 billion debt and to
buy back stock in an effort to boost shareholder value and enhance
its balance sheet.
   Texas Oil has been a disappointment to USX since it was acquired
in 1986 in a $3 billion stock swap.
   ``I think shareholders have just lost their patience,''
Fleischer said Monday after the sale was announced.
   USX is showing a willingness to part with assets that probably
will appreciate if held long enough but could enhance the stock's
value now, he said.
   ``This is a very strong statement that they're committed to
shareholders,'' Fleischer said.
   Chief among the shareholders who stand to benefit is corporate
raider Carl Icahn, who holds an 11 percent stake in USX.
   Fleischer and analyst Frank Bracken of Fidelity Investments of
Boston valued the reserves at around $1.5 billion. A sale is
anticipated by year's end, said USX spokesman William E. Keslar,
who declined to say how USX values the reserves.
   USX said it has retained the investment banking firm First
Boston Corp. to handle the sale. The reserves are principally
located in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Colorado and
Kansas.
   After racking up impressive operating income of $547 million in
1984 and $377 million in 1985, Texas Oil &amp; Gas reported an
operating loss of $21 million the year USX acquired it. It then
broke about even with $2 million the next year and lost $31 million
last year.
   The sale, besides boosting Texas Oil's earnings, will help with
USX's goal of reducing debt and may lead to the repurchase of stock
or raise the dividend, he said.
   USX had been pinning its hopes for a turnaround at Texas Oil on
the prospect of a surge in natural gas prices.
   ``I'm bullish on gas prices,'' Bracken said. ``I'd expect over
the next two to three years gas would reach `btu' parity with oil.''
   If priced equally with the energy content of oil at $20 per
barrel, gas would cost $2.50 to $2.75 per thousand cubic feet, he
said. The spot price of gas now is around $1.50 per thousand cubic
feet, although it is expected to average $1.60 to $1.75 for the
year.
   Texas Oil has 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in reserve,
about a quarter of the 3.5 trillion cubic feet held by the other
USX subsidiary, Marathon Oil Co. Texas Oil has 28 million barrels
of oil, or 3 percent of Marathon's 766 million.
   The sale would not affect gas gathering, the bulk of TXO's
business, or contract drilling, USX said. The steel company will
retain Texas Oil's vast transmission business as well as its gas
gathering and contract drilling business.
   Gas gathering accounted for $538 million of TXO's $937 million
in total sales last year. Drilling and other activites had sales
totaling $41 million.
   The remainder, or $358 million, came from the sale of petroleum.

<HEAD>European Foreign Ministers Adopt TV Proposal Opposed By U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European foreign ministers Tuesday adopted a
measure intended to prompt local television stations to use mostly
home-grown programs.
   The officials, representing the 12 nations of the European
Community, approved the proposal during the start of day-long talks
on a range of foreign policy and trade issues.
   Only Belgium and Denmark opposed the TV plan, according to a
community spokesman, who demanded anonymity.
   The proposal, called Television Without Frontiers, has sparked
sharp complaints from the U.S. government and film industry.
   It sets out the trading bloc's blueprint for opening up TV
broadcasting as part of the move to a single, European-wide market
of 320 million consumers in late 1992. By that date, the dozen
nations of the Common Market intend to remove the many trade
barriers restricting the free movement of money, goods, services
and people.
   The TV measure would enable broadcasters in Europe to transmit
channels throughout the trading bloc as long as they did not
violate certain moral and other standards.
   But it also contained a provision designed to ensure that _
``where practicable'' _ a majority of entertainment programs shown
on European television be made in Europe.
   In approving the measure, the foreign ministers agreed on
wording that, according to the spokesman, says, ``This is an
obligation which is politically binding on member states to
achieve.''
   The United States has urged the community to scrap the plan. The
American TV industry said its European earnings would be seriously
hurt by such a restriction.
   During a European swing last month, U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills reiterated the American opposition.
   ``We are not in favor of local content in any context and more
particularly in the province of thoughts,'' she said.
   Local content provisions refer to measures requiring that a
certain percentage of a product be produced domestically.
   There has been concern in the United States about several
community proposals that would appear to throw up protectionist
barriers around the European-wide market in 1992.
   Mrs. Hills had earlier written key members of the European
Parliament, the community's legislative body, to complain about the
TV measure.
   Community quotas, she wrote, ``would be blatantly
discriminatory, patently unjustifiable, and would almost certainly
have a disastrous effect on the U.S. industry's substantial
European earnings.''
   Defenders of quotas argued that European culture was at stake.
They fear a flood of American soap operas, sitcoms and other
programs would tie up the airwaves.
   News, sports and game shows would be excluded.

<HEAD>Soybean Trader Pleads Guilty to Mail Fraud at Board of Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former soybean trader at the Chicago Board of
Trade became the 13th person to plead guilty in connection with a
federal investigation into illegal commodity trading activity.
   John Eggum, 47, pleaded guilty Monday to two counts of mail
fraud before U.S. District Court Judge William T. Hart. Eggum
admitted to making a pre-arranged trade with an undercover FBI
agent, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Rotert.
   ``Eggum misled the customer'' by noting a false time for placing
his order and made about $125 on May 19, 1988 on a ``curb'' trade,
after official trading had ended, Rotert said.
   Also, on Jan. 5, 1989, Eggum admitted to making $50 for a fellow
trader to make up for a mistake Eggum had made, Rotert said.
   ``He deliberately sold at a price below what the lot was
trading,'' he said. ``He used the customer order to repay another
trader.''
   The charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine, but prosecutors have said they will seek lighter
sentences for those who agreed to cooperate.
   The trader to whom Eggum paid the $50 was Harry Patten III, who
already has entered a guilty plea for two counts of violation of
the Commodities Exchange Act.
   The FBI spent 2{ years investigating fraudulent trading at the
BOT and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In all, 46 traders and a clerk
were indicted. Thirteen people have pleaded guilty, and three have
not yet entered pleas. The rest have pleaded innocent.

<TEXT>
   Teamsters Joint Council 73, weary of
wisecracks about former union president Jimmy Hoffa, has passed a
resolution condemning politicians who make jokes about his
disappearance.
   The resolution was adopted unanimously Monday by the Joint
Council's legislative conference in Atlantic City. The council
represents most union locals in New York and New Jersey, with a
total of about 100,000 members.
   In an interview in the November issue of Playboy magazine, a
self-professed hitman claims Hoffa's body was buried near the west
end zone of Giants Stadium in East Rutherford.
   Gov. Thomas Kean, seeking to boost fellow Republican James
Courter's bid to replace him, invoked Hoffa's name in taking a jab
at the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Rep. James Florio.
   ``Trying to find out where Jim Florio stands is like trying to
find out where Jimmy Hoffa is buried _ and it's not under Giants
Stadium,'' Kean said last week in addressing a GOP fundraiser that
was attended by President Bush.
   Anthony Rizzo, business manager of Teamsters Local 945 in Wayne,
introduced the measure.
   ``If you don't have any respect for the man, then think at least deadline
at hand, the United
States and Egypt are exerting heavy pressure on Israel to go along
with a proposal for preliminary peace talks with Palestinian
representatives.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak sounded upbeat Monday about
prospects for a peace settlement, saying a ``golden opportunity''
exists that must not be squandered.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has been campaigning
hard for a more flexible Israeli position on the issue, said Israel
should not feel threatened by the 10-point proposal for peace talks
set forth by Mubarak.
   The inner cabinet of ministers from Likud and Labor is to meet
Thursday on Mubarak's ideas amid deep divisions on how to proceed.
   Likud rejects Mubarak's acceptance of a U.S.-backed formula that
involves trading occupied land for peace and including people
deported by Israel in a Palestinian negotiating delegation. Labor,
led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, supports both ideas.
   Meanwhile, President Bush called Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir on Monday and told him ``a dialogue was necessary'' between
Israel and the Palestinians, presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater disclosed today.
   Fitzwater said that Bush spoke with the Israeli leader for
``just a few minutes'' in advance of Monday's White House meeting
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   ``The discussion was very general,'' Fitzwater said, saying Bush
contacted Shamir mainly as a courtesy.
   ``He emphasized our interest in the peace process...that he
obviously felt a dialogue was necessary,'' Fitzwater said.
   Mubarak told reporters the essential next step in the peace
process is to persuade the Israelis and the Palestinians to enter a
dialogue ``without preconditions.''
   ``We won't get to peace until Palestinians and Israelis speak to
each other,'' Baker said.
   Baker regards the Egyptian plan as a complement to _ not a
substitute for _ Shamir's proposal for elections in which
Palestinians would select representatives to negotiate with Israel
on limited self-government in the occupied territories.
   Monday's White House session came amid new concern that settling
Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank could threaten peace efforts.
   Bush administration officials reacted coolly to an Israeli
request for $400 million in housing loan guarantees for about
100,000 Jewish emigres from the Soviet Union. Israeli officials
have said some dwellings probably will be in the West Bank.
   ``The United States policy is to oppose additional settlements
in the occupied territories,'' Baker said.
   Baker also said U.S. ability to assist Israel is limited by
``severe budgetary constraints.''

   Declining interest rates provided the spark for
a broad advance in the stock market today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.25 to 2,723.97
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 410 up, 190
down and 393 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 27.24 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market gathered some forward momentum late Monday in a late
round of buying that lifted the Dow Jones industrial average above
2,700 to a four-week high.
   Analysts said stocks got a further boost this morning when
interest rates fell in the credit markets.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose about $2 or $3 for
each $1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to the 8.17
percent-8.25 percent range.
   Analysts said hopes seemed to be increasing that the Federal
Reserve might soon find room to relax its credit policy further,
given a relatively slow pace of economic growth and no recent sign
of increasing inflationary pressures.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Merck rose } to 76{; American
Express { to 36{; Philip Morris ~ to 167{, and General Electric [
to 57~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .53 to 195.43. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.13 at 390.79.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.90 to
2,713.72, its highest close since it stood at 2,719.79 on Sept. 6.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 853 up, 593 down and 509 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 127.41 million shares, against 155.30
million in the previous session.

will merge their biotechnology operations into a jointly operated
bio-products company, Kodak officials said today.
   The company will be a 50-50 joint venture, with headquarters in
Rochester, Kodak spokesman Paul Allen said. It will employ 300
workers in the United States and Europe, all existing employees of
the two companies, he said. Sales are expected to exceed $50
million a year.
   The new company will include Kodak's Bio-Products Division and
the bio-products business of the Helsinki-based Cultor Ltd.,
formerly known as Finnish Sugar Co. Ltd. Cultor is a publicly held
company with sales of $922 million in 1988.
   Kodak did not release financial details of the joint venture.
Allen said the move was part of Kodak's plan to focus on its core
businesses and either divest or find new ways to manage other
businesses.
   The agreement includes Kodak operations in Rochester and in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where a large-scale fermentation plant is under
construction.
   One of the biggest products of Kodak's bio-products division is
Snomax, an artificial snow maker. Cultor's bio-products division
manufactures industrial enzymes and biochemicals.
   ``This joint venture will allow both partners to leverage their
existing commitment to biotechnology, maintain their access to
important technology and gain an established customer base,'' said
Kodak Vice President Dennis DeLeo.
   Jose J. Coronas, general manager and vice president of Kodak's
bio-products division, was named president and chief executive
officer of the joint venture.

   Windshields were smashed and tires
flattened today on a picket line set up in support of the United
Mine Workers strike against Pittston Coal Group.
   More than 350 miners in Kentucky and West Virginia walked out
Monday at mines filling Pittston orders.
   At the Rob Fork Mining Co., State Police said ``jackrocks,'' or
bent roofing nails welded together, were used to flatten the tires
of at least three coal trucks, a management employee's pickup and a
State Police cruiser. Two passing coal trucks had windshields
smashed.
   Nearly 200 men in camouflage congregated around the entrance to
Rob Fork, where the strike affects 50 miners. As the crowd parted
to allow foremen to drive through, a faint ringing could be heard
as jackrocks dropped on the pavement.
   State Police said no immediate arrests were made.
   A striking miner was hit by a non-union coal truck attempting to
cross a picket line Monday, but he was not seriously hurt. The
incident set off a four-hour confrontation between miners and a
convoy of non-union trucks poised to cross the line to unload their
coal. The standoff ended with the trucks driving away.
   State Police dispatched 38 troopers, but there were no arrests
and no reported problems at other picket lines in Kentucky or West
Virginia.
   UMW President Richard Trumka ordered selective strikes at two
mines in Kentucky and five in West Virginia to block shipments of
coal the union contended were bound for the Pittston Coal Group for
processing. Pittston is the nation's largest coal exporter.
   About 1,700 union members in Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky have been on strike against Pittston since April 5 after
working more than a year without a contract. The dispute centers on
health and pension benefits and job security.
   About 250 UMW employees walked off the jobs at Sunglo Mining Co.
and Rob Fork Mining, both based in southern Pike County. Just
across the state line in Logan County, W.Va., the union targeted
M&amp;H Coal Co., War Eagle Construction Co., Gar Coal Co., Auger
Resources and Can Run Coal Co.

   A decline in interest rates on credit markets
propelled prices higher on Wall Street today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.81 to 2,728.53
as of 11 a.m. EDT.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by a margin of about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
722 up, 466 down and 547 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 58.45 million shares at
mid-morning.
   The market gathered some forward momentum late Monday in a late
round of buying that lifted the Dow Jones industrial average above
2,700 to a four-week high.
   Analysts said stocks got a further boost this morning when
interest rates fell in the credit markets.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose about $3.75 for each
$1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to about 8.18 percent.
   Analysts said hopes seemed to be increasing that the Federal
Reserve might soon find room to relax its credit policy further,
given a relatively slow pace of economic growth and no recent sign
of increasing inflationary pressures.
   The Fed's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee,
was meeting today, but it was unlikely any decisions would be
immediately announced by the central bank.
   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was USX, which was
unchanged at 34~.
   Among blue chip issues, Boeing was up 1| to 58\ as the company's
unionized machinists voted on whether to accept a three-year
contract offer or reaffirm a midnight strike deadline.
   American Express was up 1 to 37 and General Electric rose ] to

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 0.70 to 195.60. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.43 at 391.09.

   George E. Johnson, founder of Johnson Products
Co., has resigned as chairman of the beauty products concern and is
turning over the company's reins to his ex-wife as part of a
divorce settlement.
   Joan B. Johnson now owns or controls 61 percent of the common
stock in the company, which is one of the nation's biggest
black-owned businesses. She formerly served as company treasurer,
Johnson officials said Monday.
   Johnson, 62, founded the company in 1954 in Chicago and it
became the first black-owned company traded on the American Stock
Exchange in 1971. Johnson Products makes and markets hair-care and
cosmetics under such brand names as Gentle-Treatment, Ultra Sheen
and Classy Curl.
   In 1987, Johnson reported sales of $33.9 million, but in 1988
reported a loss of $3.7 million on $29.1 million in sales.
   Johnson Products ranked 17th on Black Enterprise magazine's list
of the nation's 100 largest black-owned companies for the year
ended Dec. 31, 1988 and was the only publicly-held company listed.
   Before his divorce, Johnson was the company's principal
stockholder. A statement issued by the company said he would
continue his affiliation with Johnson Products as a consultant.
   The founder's eldest son, company president Eric G. Johnson, was
elected Monday as chief executive officer.
   Eric Johnson said he was pleased the company would continue to
be controlled by the family and said he looked forward to
completion of an internal reorganization begun 18 months ago.

<HEAD>Court Ruling Upends Biggest EEOC Age Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Payments of $35 million, the largest age
discrimination settlement ever reached by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, may be out of reach for 4,000 Westinghouse
Electric Corp. retirees due to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, a legal
specialist said.
   The court on Monday overturned a lower ruling that the
Pittsburgh-based electronics and electric power giant had
discriminated against the retirees when it offered them a choice
between severence pay or early pensions. The employees could not
have both under the company program.
   Backed by a U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruling favoring
the retirees, the EEOC negotiated a settlement with Westinghouse a
year ago. The 4,000 employees would have shared $35 million, or an
average of $8,700 per person, to settle their claims.
   EEOC spokeswoman Deborah Graham in Washington said the
Westinghouse case was the commission's largest age discrimination
settlement.
   The EEOC, however, decided instead to seek a court ruling, she
said.
   ``It means they blew it. They got greedy, in my opinion,'' said
Dick Lauver, a Pittsburgh pension lawyer who was not involved in
the case. ``They chose to forgo a very favorable settlement to get
a favorable court decision.
   ``The case is far from over,'' said Donald Livingston, special
assistant to the EEOC general counsel in Washington. ``There are
still a number of areas for the court to decide.''
   ``If the EEOC was a law firm, they could probably be sued for
negligence,'' Lauver said. ``Those Westinghouse employees are
probably very upset.''
   Westinghouse said it was delighted with Monday's Supreme Court
ruling. The company will ask the 3rd Circuit Court to reconsider
its case in light of the new ruling and a Supreme Court ruling in
June that puts more of a burden on the employee to prove
discrimination.

<HEAD>McCaw Buying Half-Interest In NYC Cellular; Selling Southern Properties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said
today it was acquiring a half-interest in a New York City cellular
franchise and selling interests in three Southern states to Contel
Cellular Inc.
   The first agreement could lead to McCaw gaining sole control
over one of the two cellular-telephone franchises in New York, the
nation's biggest market.
   The second, covering 13 mobile-telephone franchises in Alabama,
Kentucky and Tennessee, would make the Contel Corp. subsidiary the
nation's seventh-largest cellular phone company, according to a
statement issued by McCaw, the largest.
   The statement said McCaw signed an agreement to acquire the
Metromedia Co. interest in one of two New York cellular franchises
for $1.9 billion in cash, about $275 per ``pop,'' subject to a
45-day right of first refusal by LIN Broadcasting Corp.
   A pop is an industry yardstick obtained by multiplying a market
area population by the percentage ownership of a cellular company
serving the market. Two cellular franchises, one for the local
telephone company and one for an independent operation like McCaw,
are available in each market.
   The Metromedia deal would give McCaw a 50 percent voting
interest and 45.67 percent equity interest in the New York
franchise.
   LIN holds a 50 percent voting interest and 45 percent equity
interest in the franchise, which would be controlled entirely by
McCaw if the LIN acquisition goes through.
   McCaw's separate $110-a-share cash tender offer for the
approximately 53 million shares in LIN, a deal amounting to $250 to
$265 a pop, has been extended to Oct. 13. McCaw, LIN's largest
shareholder with a 10 percent interest, has been tendered more than
8 million shares, said Tom Campo at Adams &amp; Rinehart, representing
McCaw in New York.
   The Contel agreement would provide McCaw about $1.3 billion in
cash, about $205 a pop, subject to closing price adjustments.
   The Metromedia deal covers about 6.8 million pops and the Contel
deal about 6.1 million pops.
   These are ``two more steps toward achieving our longstanding
strategic objective of creating a national cellular network that
will give American consumers an independent alternative to
traditional providers of telephone service,'' McCaw Chairman Craig
O. McCaw said.
   He described Contel as ``a fellow independent with whom we have
had a long and mutually beneficial relationship.''
   McCaw, based in this Seattle suburb, operates in 127 areas with
a total of 50 million pops in 26 states, including major regional
systems along the West Coast and in the Rocky Mountains, Northeast,
Florida and Texas.

<HEAD>Brazil See Little Chance of Early Moves to Support World Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer,
dashed hopes Wednesday of any early agreement to bring the
depressed world coffee market back under international control.
   Brazil's chief coffee executive Jorio Dauster said there was
``no chance of having quotas again in the near future'' because
members of the international coffee group can't come to terms on
export limits that ultimately set prices.
   Dauster heads the Brazilian delegation attending talks in London
at the International Coffee Organization.
   ``I don't see any real change in the positions that led us into
the deadlock,'' Dauster told reporters at a news conference. ``We
should not rush into new negotiations unless we see that the
elements that led us to deadlock have been removed.''
   The organization Monday announced a two-year extension of the
International Coffee Agreement retroactive to Sunday but without
any price-support provisions.
   The agreement keeps in existence the International Coffee
Organization as a forum for discussing matters of mutual concern to
41 coffee exporting countries and 18 importing countries.
   The organization was propping up prices in the glutted world
market through export quotas aimed at supporting prices of beans at
$1.20 per pound or more.
   The organization's regulatory powers were suspended indefinitely
on July 4 after the United States pulled out in a price dispute
with coffee-producing nations. The United States wanted an increase
in export quotas for higher-quality coffees enjoyed by U.S.
consumers.
   Since July, the price of coffee beans has dropped by more than
30 percent to a 14-year low, threatening a huge loss in income for
producing countries such as Uganda, the Ivory Coast, Colombia and
most central American nations, where coffee is one of the top
foreign income earners.
   The suspension of quotas followed a fight among producers over
export market shares.
   In the previous negotiations, Brazil resisted moves to cut its
30 percent share of the export quota to bump up the allocation of
Central American producers of the popular mild arabica variety.
   Colombia, the world's second biggest producer, has led the
campaign to bring back quotas, seeing increased export earnings as
critical to help it finance the fight against the country's drug
cartel.

<HEAD>MGM Grand to Build Movie Theme Park in Las Vegas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   MGM Grand Inc. announced plans
today to convert a Las Vegas golf course into a movie theme park
and a 5,000-room hotel-casino in efforts to entice both family
fun-seekers and high rollers.
   ``The theme as far as movies is concerned has always been an
interesting mouse trap,'' said MGM Grand chairman Fred Benninger at
a news conference here.
   The Kirk Kerkorian-owned company has agreed to purchase 115
acres on the strip, the current site of the Marina Hotel and Casino
and Tropicana Country Club and Golf Course, for the as-yet named
theme park, said Benninger.
   The purchase of the land means MGM will construct a theme park
twice the size originally planned for property on the MGM-owned
Desert Inn.
   The purchase price was not revealed, but Benninger said that MGM
Grand plans to spend as much as $700 million to add 4,300 rooms to
the 700-room Marina and to build the theme park with a working film
and television studio.
   The MGM Grand complex, to open in 1992, is the latest effort to
woo families to Las Vegas. Circus Circus, the first resort to do so
more than a decade ago, is now one of the most successful gaming
and entertainment operations in Nevada.
   ``Clearly the theme park idea is one that has been looked at for
quite a while and I believe it's another extension of what Las
Vegas stands for,'' said Harold Vogel, the veteran entertainment
analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   ``It's an adult resort, and now they're going to extend it so
the rest of the family members can enjoy it too,'' Vogel said
Thursday.
   MGM Grand, a separate company from MGM-UA, owns an all-frills
Los Angeles-New York airline and the Desert Inn in Las Vegas. It
also retains rights to a stylized version of the famous MGM lion.
   The Beverly Hills billionaire, 72, had sold and bought back bits
and pieces of MGM-UA for two decades, a period during which he also
traded Las Vegas hotels the way most people buy cars.
   Then last month, Australia's Qintex Group agreed to purchase
MGM-UA _ including the original lion logo _ for $1.5 billion,
outbidding media mogul Rupert Murdoch by $100 million.
   Las Vegas city and tourism officials have said for years that
the city needed a major theme park to help attract families as
visitors. A water theme park, built on the Las Vegas Strip five
years ago, has been extremely successful.
   Las Vegas will count more than 18 million visitors this year, up
from 11 million in 1980.
   The city is approaching the size that could support such a
venture, boosters of the idea say. Las Vegas had 300,000 residents
eight years ago. Today it has more than 700,000 and is one of the
fastest growing cities in the country.
   A fire at the original MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, which
Kerkorian built in 1973, killed 84 people in 1980. In 1985,
Kerkorian sold that MGM Grand and its sister hotel in Reno to Bally
Manufacturing Co. of Chicago for nearly $500 million.

<TEXT>
   New home sales fell a slight 0.4 percent in
August but remained over 750,000 for the second straight month, the
government reported Tuesday, as buyers took advantage of lower
interest rates.
   Analysts had forecast a steeper slide in August sales from a
double-digit gain in July, the largest advance in three years. They
said the pace cannot be sustained but will remain healthy for the
rest of the year.
   The Commerce Department said that new single-family homes were
sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 755,000 in August, a
relatively small drop from July's revised 758,000 rate, which was a
16.1 percent increase over June.
   The Commerce report indicated new home sales were stronger
throughout the summer than previously thought. Not only was the
July figure revised upward; so too were the May and June figures,
both of which totaled 653,000 units.
   ``It appears that the new home market is steaming along,'' said
economist John A. Tuccillo of the National Association of Realtors.
``What is noteworthy about the August numbers is not that they have
gone down, but that sales remained at an extremely high level.''
   The sales improvement was attributed by analysts to fixed-rate
mortgages that dropped from an 11.22 percent peak in March to 9.81
percent at the end of August.
   The lower rates also improved sales of existing homes which,
according to the National Association of Realtors, rose 3.3 percent
in August to 3.44 million units.
   However, mortgage rates had climbed back up to 10.16 percent by
last Friday, according to a survey by the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp., and analysts said the increase will affect future
sales.
   ``It will be difficult to maintain this (new home sales) rate
particularly since mortgage rates have increased,'' said Michael
Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders.
   Richard Peach, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association,
agreed the current pace is not sustainable, but said a sales range
of between 680,000 to 700,000 ``still would be a very healthy pace
for the new home market.''
   Mark Obrinsky, an economist at the Federal National Mortgage
Association, also said the summer sales, which lowered inventories
from an eight-month backlog in July to a six-month supply
currently, should result in increased single-family housing starts
this fall.
   Despite the recent boom, sales for the first eight months were
held back 2.7 percent from the same period in 1988 by the higher
interest rates earlier in the year as the Federal Reserve tightened
credit to slow inflation.
   Sales of new homes in the Northeast, which had jumped 50 percent
to 108,000 units in July, slipped 0.9 percent in August to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 107,000 units.
   Sales in the Midwest were down 27.9 percent to 93,000 units
after rising 26.7 percent to 129,00 units a month earlier. Sales in
the South rose 6.2 percent to 310,000 and were up 6.6 percent in
the West to 244,000 units.
   The Commerce Department report said the median price of a new
home was $122,900 in August, up 6.0 percent from $116,000 in July.
The median is the point where half of the homes sold for more and
half for less.
   The average price of a new home rose 14.6 percent to $162,300.

   Shares prices closed sharply higher Tuesday as
enthusiasm over Wall Street's continued advance overcame concern
over prospects for a British interest rate hike.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 29.4

   The Financial Times 30-share index ended 22.4 points higher at

   Volume came to 553.8 million shares, higher than Monday's 403.8
million shares.
   Dealers said that even though fears of a British interest rate
hike still were prevalent, the market was underpinned by the
pound's strength after repeated British central bank support.

<HEAD>Great American Announces Purchase of Two FM Radio Stations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great American Broadcasting Co. says it has
agreed to buy FM radio stations in Denver and Tampa, Fla., and will
seek a waiver to operate the Tampa station in a market where the
company operates a television station.
   Great American did not disclose what it will pay Sandusky Radio
for the two stations, KBPI in Denver and WKRL in Tampa. The
purchase brings to 12 the number of FM stations Great American owns.
   ``We are looking forward to entering the Denver radio market.
Our former company, Taft Broadcasting, owned radio stations in
Tampa and we are pleased that Great American Broadcasting will
return to that outstanding radio market,'' Carl J. Wagner, Great
American broadcast group president, said Monday in announcing the
purchase.
   Great American sold its previous Tampa stations when it acquired
WTSP-TV in 1985. If the Federal Communications Commission approves
the purchase of WKRL, it will be the second time Great American has
taken advantage of a more liberal FCC policy toward common
ownership of TV and radio stations within a single market.
   The FCC relaxed waiver standards earlier this year, saying it
would look favorably on applications in Top 25 markets with a
diversity of independent broadcast voices.
   In applying for a waiver earlier this year for Cincinnati and
Kansas City, Great American cited numerous operating efficiencies
gained from having both TV and radio stations in a market. The FCC
granted waivers in both cases, although Cincinnati and Kansas City
rank just below the top 25 markets.

   Japan's Nomura Securities Co. Tuesday named an
American veteran of Wall Street as co-chairman of its U.S.
securities operation, a step toward giving it an American identity
and management style.
   Max C. Chapman Jr., the 46-year-old former president and chief
executive of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. Inc., said he hoped to put a
Wall Street stamp on the U.S. operations of the world's largest
securities firm.
   ``I believe Nomura is deadly serious about trying to find a way
to marry their system and the good parts of the American system
together,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Chapman _ who served as a captain in the Marine Corps Reserve
and played football four years at the University of North Carolina
_ will share the top job at Nomura with the current chairman,
Katsuya Takanashi.
   Nomura has invested heavily in its New York operation but has
yet to show consistent success. Its U.S. operations lost about $18
million in the year ended Sept. 30, 1988, and Nomura has reduced
its broker-dealer staff to 550 from a peak of 650 before the 1987
stock market crash, the company said.
   Chapman, who spent his entire career at Kidder, said he resigned
from the firm earlier this year after being passed over for the job
of chief executive of Kidder's parent company, Kidder, Peabody
Group Inc., which is majority owned by General Electric Co.
   Nomura is the last of Japan's big four securities firms to have
an American in the rank of co-chairman or vice chairman. Chapman
will serve as co-chairman of both Nomura Securities International
Inc. and Nomura Holding America Inc.
   Nomura's main business in the United States is funneling money
from Japanese investors into the U.S. stock and bond markets. It
also works with Japanese companies doing business in the United
States. Its goal is to pick up more American customers,
particularly corporations that need sophisticated financial
services.
   Chapman said the United States has the world's most efficient
financial markets and he believes he can help spread American
innovations to other markets, including Tokyo's.
   ``Someone had to satisfy me that there was a sincere desire to
modify and work together, to build an American-type firm within a
Japanese organization,'' Chapman said. ``That will determine the
success of many multinationals, to find bridge between cultures and
styles.''

   Prices moved higher on Wall Street today as blue
chip issues extended their rally and the outlook for interest rates
brightened.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials surged 21.65 to 2,735.37
as of 2 p.m. EDT after climbing nearly 21 points on Monday.
   The broader market also advanced, but lagged a little behind the
blue chips. Gainers outnumbered losers by a margin of about 9 to 5
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues,
with 895 stocks up, 516 down and 507 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 129.93 million shares with two
hours of trading left.
   The market gathered some forward momentum late Monday in a late
round of buying that lifted the Dow Jones industrial average above
2,700 to a four-week high and that continued into today.
   Analysts said the stronger dollar and gains on the bond markets
helped spark today's Wall Street advance.
   Bond prices moved higher on optimism that interest rates might
come down. Prices of long-term Treasury bonds rose about $3 for
each $1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to about 8.18
percent.
   Analysts said hopes seemed to be increasing that the Federal
Reserve might soon find room to relax its credit policy further,
given a relatively slow pace of economic growth and no recent sign
of increasing inflationary pressures.
   The Fed's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee,
was meeting today, but it was unlikely that the central bank would
immediately announce any decisions.
   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was USX, which was up
\ to 35[. On Monday, the company announced it was selling oil and
natural gas reserves through its Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. subsidiary,
and analysts have estimated USX could get $1.5 billion in the sale.
   Among other blue chip issues, Boeing was up 2{ to 59[ as the
company's unionized machinists voted on whether to accept a
three-year contract offer or reaffirm a midnight strike deadline.
   IBM was off 2{ to 106[, American Express was up 1| to 37| and
General Electric rose ] to 58[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.20 to 196.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 2.56 at 392.22.

<HEAD>Hello `Smart Toilets,' Car Radar; Good-Bye Bad Service, Loud Rock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE WHEELAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Smart toilets'' and car radar will usher in the
high-tech advances coming in the 1990s, while bad service, loud
rock music and Mexican beer will become passe, says ``The American
Forecaster 1990.''
   Other trends on the rise for 1990 are New Age radio, portraits
commissioned for ego gratification and ``wet'' beer to serve on the
rocks, says Kim Long, author of the yearly book.
   White will be the fashionable color in clothing for women, who
will favor shorter hair, he says. Men will grow their hair longer
and wear wider ties, the Forecaster predicts.
   ``In the 1990s we will see phenomenal advances. A popular phrase
some futurists are using is that life has the potential to move
forward very rapidly because 80 percent of all the scientists and
engineers who have ever lived are alive today,'' said Long.
   ``The corollary to that is that 80 percent of all the artists,
crackpots and loonies who have ever lived are alive today. We will
see some intriguing things happen in the 1990s,'' he said,
including a wave of bizarre prognostications as the year 2000
approaches.
   Long, 40, is a Denver free-lance author who began writing the
Forecaster in 1983 and claims an 80 percent accuracy rate. He
wrongly predicted a Dukakis presidency and the demise of
television's ``Dallas'' and ``Dynasty,'' but he estimated half his
material reflects inevitable consumer trends.
   For example, a few years ago, he forecast that Cabbage Patch
doll sales would drop by half. ``They dropped off by more than
half. It wasn't guesswork. The information came from the toy
industry, which says that all fad toys that sell that well that
quickly are temporary phenomena.''
   His predictions sometimes are based on his research into
Japanese product development.
   ``Smart toilets'' are made by a Japanese company to measure
recent hospital outpatients' blood pressure, pulse, urine,
temperature and body weight. Results are displayed on a built-in
monitor. Long predicts gadget lovers will pay the $3,000 to have a
conversation piece.
   Other high-tech trends in 1990 will be robot hamburger-makers
employed by fast-food franchises to solve chronic labor problems,
and car radar.
   Long said car radar systems will gauge other vehicles' speeds
and may incorporate automatic braking. Some experts believe if all
vehicles had the devices, highways could be safely packed with
vehicles moving at high speeds.
   New Age radio took off so quickly that it is a major trend, said
Long.
   ``It's going to be a permanent form of programming,'' he said.
``It's been called musical wallpaper, at its most disparaging. It's
somewhere between jazz and soft rock, and it has the potential to
not offend a fairly wide proportion of the population.''
   Meanwhile, affluent executives are commissioning sculptures and
portraits of themselves and their families, a trend Long calls
``ego-art.'' ``They are recycling what once was a very solid
artistic tradition.''
   A low-budget version, the video booth, is cropping up in
shopping centers and shouldering aside the booths where people used
to have wallet-size snapshots taken. ``They shoot a five- or
10-minute videotape,'' said Long. ``You can speak, sing, or quote
poetry. It's the concept of immortalizing yourself.''
   A major trend that will carry through the 1990s is a campaign by
retailers to stamp out bad service.
   ``Surveys, polls and extensive studies have shown that this is
the top priority,'' Long said. ``We have become line-sensitive.
Queueing up is a foreign disease that we don't want to catch.''
   Ear plugs are being offered to customers at pop music clubs and
rock concerts because of concern about hearing loss, according to
``The American Forecaster.'' He notes that at the same time,
over-amped car sound systems are booming.
   Among drinkers, the Mexican beer fad will be on the way out, he
predicted. Liquor with lower alcohol levels and ``wet'' beer, a
brew served on the rocks, will debut in 1990 while low-alcohol beer
will continue to founder, said Long.
   Long's book, which sells fewer than 10,000 copies despite all
the interest it stirs up, may be in for some high-tech changes
itself. In the works is a possible video version with computer
animation, and Long is exploring use of a computer database and
facsimile machine to dispense his prognostications.

   Boeing Co. workers cast ballots today to decide
whether to accept a three-year contract offer from the prospering
aerospace company or reaffirm a midnight strike deadline for about
50,000 employees.
   Boeing and the Machinists union said talks that began Sept. 21
and were joined by a federal mediator during the weekend ended
early Monday.
   ``They said, `This is our final and best offer. This is it. It's
over,''' said Tom Baker, president of District Lodge 751 in Seattle.
   Neither Baker nor Paul Binder of Boeing referred to the offer as
an agreement or tentative settlement. Neither side would disclose
any details, and Baker wouldn't say whether union leaders recommend
acceptance or rejection.
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer today quoted unnamed sources as
saying the proposed pact provides pay boosts of 4 percent in the
first year and 3 percent in the second and third years, as well as
production bonuses of 8 percent and 4 percent, respectively, in the
first two years. The last contract included annual bonuses but no
increase in base wages, which determine other benefits.
   The pact also contains some reduction in mandatory overtime,
which is limited to 200 hours per quarter under the current
contract, the newspaper reported.
   ``We've made progress in some areas, but we're not jumping up
and down,'' Baker said Monday.
   Groups of workers picketed on Monday outside an administration
building in Everett and at the Westin Hotel in Seattle, where the
latest talks took place.
   ``The tension here is so thick that you can feel it,'' said a
worker on the 767 production line in Everett. The worker, who asked
that his name not be used, said some workers marched through the
plant chanting ``strike, strike, strike'' during their lunch hour
Monday.
   Simultaneous votes were scheduled today for the 43,300
Seattle-area members of the union lodge, as well as 12,000
Machinists in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and several
hundred at smaller Boeing job sites around the country, Baker said.
   A simple majority is sufficient for acceptance or rejection of
the contract, but two-thirds is required for a strike. The union
last struck Boeing in 1977. That walkout lasted two months.
   The current contract expires at midnight tonight, the same time
as the union's strike deadline.
   Boeing, the world's largest commercial airplane builder, is
enjoying its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders, with
carriers and leasing companies ordering 736 planes worth $38.5
billion so far this year.
   Though Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business, Boeing
Commercial Airplanes has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth about
$70 billion and deliveries extending well into the mid-1990s.
   During the first part of the year, Boeing had net earnings of
$356 million on sales of $9.07 billion. For 1988, profits were $614
million on $16.96 billion in sales. Boeing also holds $3.66 billion
in cash and short-term notes.
   ``The Boeing Co. is better off than it has ever been in history,
and we should be better off than we've ever been,'' Baker told a
rally last month.
   Worldwide, Boeing employs 144,725 people, including 106,000 in
Western Washington.

   Wheat futures prices advanced while other grain
and soybean futures closed narrowly mixed Tuesday on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   The modest advance in the wheat market was linked in part to
expectations that the Agriculture Department eventually will accept
an Egyptian bid for 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices.
   The USDA rejected an Egyptian bid Tuesday morning, but analysts
said Egypt had come back with a higher bid.
   Corn and soybean futures opened lower and stayed on the
defensive for most of the session. The selling reflected harvest
pressure and profit-taking after a strong rally in the previous
session.
   A National Weather Service six- to 10-day outlook issued late
Monday called for little or no rain for the Midwestern corn and
soybean country during the first four day of next week.
   Corn and soybean harvesting advanced at a strong pace last week
under ideal weather conditions, according to an Agriculture
Department report that showed 16 percent of the corn crop and 18
percent of the soybean crop harvested as of Sunday compared to 10
percent and 4 percent, respectively, a week earlier.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1\ cents to 3 cents higher with

<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp. is making the right move
by giving up its global leadership in the laptop computer market
but its success in the cutthroat television business is far from
assured, industry experts say.
   The outlook for higher TV prices bodes well in the near term for
Zenith, which is the last major TV manufacturer based in the United
States and the second-biggest seller of color TVs.
   But Zenith's survival in consumer electronics over the long haul
depends on its ability to develop innovative products while keeping
its costs low and its public profile high.
   ``It's going to be a grunt and grind to do this thing,'' Robert
Johnson, an analyst with the Houston-based brokerage firm Rotan
Mosle Inc., said Tuesday. ``But now they've got the cash to do it.''
   Zenith announced on Monday it had agreed to sell its computer
division, which includes Zenith Data Systems and the
build-it-yourself Heath Co., to France's Groupe Bull for as much as
$635 million.
   Zenith will use the proceeds to eliminate most of its burdensome
debt load. The Glenview-based company will have an after-tax gain
of $22 million, Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman said Monday.
   Zenith Data Systems sold $1.4 billion worth of computers last
year and is the world's larget seller of battery-powered laptop
computers, with 27.6 percent of the world market, according to
Dataquest, a high-technology marketing research firm.
   But in the past year, other major computer makers have
introduced laptop models that compete with Zenith's for both
consumer and defense-contract business.
   Faced with tough competition in both computers and televisions
and unable to finance both, analysts say, Zenith was forced to
choose between borrowing more money or selling part of the company.
   Unable to find a buyer willing to pay more than about $200
million for its consumer-electronics unit, Zenith opted out of the
more salable computer business instead.
   ``I thought it was something they should do but I wasn't sure
they would they would do it,'' said Mark Hassenberg of Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, one of many analysts who applauded the decision.
   According to Television Digest, a publication that tracks the TV
industry, Zenith ranked second to French-owned RCA in sales of 1989
model color TVs to U.S. dealers. But its share of the market has
slipped to 12 percent from 18.5 percent over the past seven years
while such competitors as Sharp, Mitsubishi and Toshiba have
steadily gained market share.
   Pearlman said Zenith's consumer electronics business was
profitable in 1988 excluding interest costs and is expected to be
$15 million more profitable than that in 1989, again excluding
interest costs.
   He also emphasized Zenith's commitment to high-definition
television, using sharper-picture technology that some see as the
future of TV.
   But analysts said HDTV is still several years away. And
prospects for higher TV prices after nearly a decade of decline are
tied to a continued shortage of glass for picture tubes and
continued strong demand from China.
   The Zenith that emerges after the computer-division sale will
have lots of cash and not much debt, which could make it an
attractive takeover target, some analysts believe.
   But other say foreign television makers, the most likely
suitors, would be reluctant to bid for America's last TV maker.
That was what made it difficult to sell the television business in
the first place.
   ``It's easier for a foreign company to buy the computer business
because there are a lot of other U.S. computer businesses,'' said
analyst Laura Lederman of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago.

   The manager of the Swedish automobile

takeover by Ford Motor Co.
   Kai Hammerich, who was meeting with the press at the Saab plant
in Bornem near Antwerp, said his company was having talks with the
U.S. carmaker on a possible cooperation or association but he
denied any plan for a takeover or merger.
   Saab lost $120 million in the first half of this year,
essentially due to lower U.S. sales, and plans to lay off 2,000 of
its 14,000 workers, the company has announced previously.

   Toro Co. has cut an $85 million deal to buy
the Lawn-Boy subsidiary of Outboard Marine Corp., a move that will
trim Toro's earnings by up to 25 percent for fiscal 1990 but double
the company's sales of walk-behind power mowers, Toro announced
Tuesday.
   The transaction is subject to government antitrust approval
because the deal would give Bloomington-based Toro about 15 percent
of the national market share in walk-behind power mowers, said
Dennis Himan, a Toro spokesman.
   ``We don't see it as a significant item,'' Himan said of the
antitrust scrutiny.
   Lawn-Boy Inc., based in Plymouth, Wis., had sales in fiscal 1988
of $153 million. The Wisconsin plant makes lawn and garden tillers,
snow throwers and space heaters. Lawn-Boy mowers are assembled at a
plant in Sardis, Miss., and engines for the mowers are made in
Oxford, Miss.
   Himan said the company has no immediate plans to alter
manufacturing locations or make layoffs.
   But Frank Rolfes, an analyst for Minneapolis-based Dain Bosworth
Inc., said he expects there to be some consolidation of operations.
   Toro, which also makes snow throwers, irrigation equipment and
other outdoor maintenance equipment, had sales in fiscal 1989 of
$643.5 million.

Ireland during the next 10 years.
   ``Europe is a very important market for Intel. It represents
almost a quarter of our annual revenues,'' said Gordon Moore,
chairman of the Santa Clara-based semiconductor company.
   John O'Brien of the Ireland Industrial Development Authority
said the Intel action is the latest in a series of such moves by
high-tech companies from the United States.
   Ireland's electronics industry boasts $5 billion in annual sales
and a workforce of 25,000.

   Prices surged higher on Wall Street today as
investors grew more optimistic about the outlook for interest rates
and snapped up blue chip and consumer stocks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials reached a new closing
high, gaining 40.84 to end the session at 2,754.56. That topped the
widely-followed barometer's previous high close of 2,752.09,
reached Sept. 1.
   The market extended its advance of Monday, when the industrial
average gained nearly 21 points.
   Analysts said a stronger dollar and gains on the bond markets
helped spark today's Wall Street performance.
   Bond prices moved higher on optimism that interest rates might
come down. Analysts said hopes seemed to be increasing that the
Federal Reserve might soon find room to relax its credit policy
further, given a relatively slow pace of economic growth and no
recent sign of increasing inflationary pressures.
   The Fed's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee,
was meeting today, but the central bank did not announce any
decisions before the close of trading.
   The stocks of financial service and other consumer-oriented
businesses were among the standouts in today's session, while some
technology issues were among the losers.
   Analysts said traders were looking for issues with predictable
growth.

<HEAD>Gillette Introduces New Razor</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. unveiled a new razor Tuesday and
said it would support it with a $175 million multinational sales
and marketing campaign, which the company said would be the biggest
ever in the shaving industry.
   But analysts said the company could nick itself in the
pocketbook if consumers don't take to the higher-priced product,
which Gillette is billing as the biggest shaving advance in 20
years.
   The silver and black razor, called Sensor, and featuring two
spring- mounted, ultra-thin blades, will be sold starting in
January at an introductory price of $3.75.
   ``We want to make sure people are not inhibited from using it
because of a high price for trial,'' said Peter Hoffman, vice
president of marketing for Gillette.
   The system's refill cartridges will cost 25 percent more than
similar blades now on the market, Hoffman said, and double the cost
of disposable razors.
   Hoffman said using the Sensor system would cost about $20 a
year, compared with about $16 for Gillette's Atra Plus and about
$10 for disposable razors.
   The new product will be promoted in 19 North Atlantic countries,
with about $80 million of the $175 million to be spent in the
United States.
   In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Gillette's
stock rose $1 to $47.87{ a share. Its stock price has surged from
about $33 a share last December, partly in anticipation of the new
product.
   ``The big concern would be `Can consumers tell the difference
between the new system and the old?''' said Bonita Austin, analyst
with the investment concern Wertheim Schroder. ``Also, it will be
more expensive to the consumer, so will the margins be as good as
other products?''
   Gillette officials said last week that the new razor was
developed over the course of about 10 years at a cost of some $200
million.
   Sensor is similar to Gillette's Atra brand, which has a
pivoting, twin-blade razor head. However, Sensor's design also
enables each spring-cushioned blade to move independently, which
Gillette says allows it to hug the skin without digging in. The
Atra Plus, with two cartridges, sells for about $4.
   Many analysts declined to comment on the new product before they
had the opportunity to view it first-hand. But most agreed the
production costs were high.
   ``They spent lot of money on it,'' said Brenda Landry, analyst
with the investment firm Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. ``But historically
when Gillette has brought out a new blade it has been successful.''
   ``Market share will be critical,'' Wertheim's Austin said.
``They will need to take enough market share to justify the
expenses.''
   Gillette said it holds 18 patents on the product and four others
are pending.
   Landry said the company will license the razors eventually to
make a compatible blade ``but it won't be this coming year.''
   Other razor companies were quick to point out the benefits of
their own products and find fault with the new razor.
   ``You're still putting cold steel on your face which I
understood was done away in a number of countries when they did
away with the guillotine. It is not the modern away of shaving,''
said Victor Kiam, president of Remington Products Inc., which has
aout 40 percent of the electric shaver market.
   Kiam added that the new product could benefit his company.
   ``What Gillette is trying to do is trade people up from
disposables to systems,'' he said. ``We're in the upper end of the
market and therefore it should help the growth of that entire
segment.''
   Warner-Lambert Co., which makes Schick razors, cited the new
razor's expected higher retail price. Schick's Ultrex Plus and Slim
Twin razors sell for under $3.
   ``With Sensor, Gillette is asking consumers to pay a
significantly higher premium price ... '' said Ray LeFebvre,
president of Warner-Lambert's consumer health products unit.
   LeFebvre also said that Schick's total market share has risen
while Gillette's has declined.
   ``If Gillette is indeed `The best a man can get,''' referring to
Gillette's advertising slogan, ``their recent sales don't support
it.''
   Gillette said the new product was simultaneously launched in the
United States, Canada and Europe, the first such international
marketing blitz for the company.
   Gillette has interests in toiletries and writing products, but
its biggest stake is in razors, where it controls more than 60
percent of the world market.
   Analysts have said the new product would help expand market
share and improve earnings for Boston-based Gillette, which fended
off takeover attempts in recent years but had to weather major
restructurings in the process.
   The company undertook a major restructuring after turning down a
$4.12 billion Revlon Group Inc. buyout offer in November 1986. Last
year, Gillette repurchased 15.6 million of its shares to head off
an attempted takeover by Coniston Partners of New York.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Sink With No Quotas In Sight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices sank to new life-of-contract lows Tuesday
on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange after Brazil's chief
coffee executive said he saw no chance for a return to
international price supports until next year.
   On other commodity markets, livestock futures advanced; precious
metals declined, energy futures rose; and grains and soybeans were
mixed.
   Futures prices for green, unroasted coffee settled 3.51 cents to
4.03 cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at
76.50 cents.
   All contracts established new lifetime lows during the session
but none fell below 74.80 cents, the 14-year low established Aug.
14 by the now-expired September contract.
   The heaviest selling occurred early in the session after Jorio
Dauster, president of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, said he saw
no possibility of a new International Coffee Agreement before next
March, when the new Brazilian president takes office.
   Dauster made the remarks to reporters covering an International
Coffee Organization meeting in London. The representatives of 41
coffee exporting countries and 18 importing countries will wrap up
their two-week session on Friday.
   Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, wields a heavy bat
at the talks. Brazil's reluctance to accept a lower coffee export
quota was one of the factors that led to a breakdown of the coffee
price support system three months ago.
   ``We should not rush into new negotiations unless we see that
the elements that led us to deadlock have been removed,'' Dauster
told reporters at a news conference.
   Few observers expect the London meeting to produce a new
price-support mechanism to succeed the export quotas that were
suspended July 4, precipitating a 30 percent drop in coffee prices.
   But Dauster's remarks reinforced perceptions that the coffee
market is headed lower still.
   Esther Eskenasy, a market analyst with Cargill Investor Services
Inc., said coffee-producing countries continue to underprice each
other in a battle for market share, eliminating an incentive for
coffee roasters to buy in large quantity.
   ``They are just buying hand-to-mouth,'' she said. ``There are a
lot of cheap coffees all over the place.''
   Ms. Eskenasy said Mexico recently dropped the price for its
old-crop coffee, which is of lower quality than newly harvested
beans, to 60 cents a pound and several other producers were selling
old-crop coffee at 65 cents a pound.
   Hog futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in
response to higher-than-expected cash prices and strengthening
chart signals. Cattle futures rebounded from Monday's steep losses.
   Live cattle settled .08 cent to .35 cent higher with October at
71.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .35 cent
higher with October at 82.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent
lower to .93 cent higher with October at 45.10 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .50 cent lower with February
at 48.50 cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures slipped lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange as the dollar strengthened on currency markets.
   Gold settled 70 cents to 80 cents lower with October at $366.90
a troy ounce; silver was 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent lower with December
at $5.295 a troy ounce.
   Most energy futures advanced modestly on the New York Mercantile
Exchange ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly report,
which showed a slight decline in refining activity, a
1.7-million-barrel increase in U.S. crude oil stocks, a
4.5-million-barrel rise in U.S. gasoline stocks and a
112,000-barrel increase in U.S. stocks of petroleum distillates.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 18 cents
higher with November at $20.13 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent
to .46 cent higher with November at 59.68 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .16 cent lower to .67 cent higher with November at
56.64 cents a gallon.
   Wheat futures advanced while other grain and soybean futures
closed narrowly mixed Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat settled 1\ cents to 3\ cents higher with December at
$4.09} a bushel; corn futures were unchanged to 1 cent lower with
December at $2.40{ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher
with December at $1.47} a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents lower to
1} cents higher with November at $5.76\ a bushel.

<HEAD>MGM Grand to Build Movie Theme Park in Las Vegas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   MGM Grand Inc. said Tuesday it will
spend $700 million to convert a Las Vegas golf course into a movie
theme park and a 5,000-room hotel-casino, gambling on luring
families to ``the best mouse trap in town.''
   ``I remember the days when Las Vegas lived almost entirely on
the high roller,'' MGM Grand chairman Fred Benninger said at a news
conference at the Beverly Hills Hotel. ``You can't do that
anymore.''
   The site is on the Las Vegas Strip location where the Tropicana
Country Club and Marina Hotel and Casino now stand. Benninger
wouldn't reveal how much MGM Grand paid for those properties.
   Other details were sketchy as well, although conceptual drawings
showed towering spires and domes, like a futuristic version of
Sleeping Beauty's Castle at Disneyland.
   MGM Grand, owned by Beverly Hills billionaire Kirk Kerkorian,
said last month it might build the theme park on a 60-acre site
beside the Desert Inn, which it owns and is promoting as a top-end
hotel-casino.
   The new theme park site, at 115 acres, is nearly twice as large.
Benninger said finding enough space was a more important
consideration than money.
   The new MGM Grand Hotel and theme park are tentatively expected
to open by late 1992.
   Benninger said he was confident the complex, with hotel rooms
costing about $40 a night, would cash in on the trend toward family
tourism in Las Vegas that began with the opening of Circus Circus a
decade ago.
   Las Vegas will count more than 18 million visitors this year, up
from 11 million in 1980. Its population has boomed from 300,000
eight years ago to more than 700,000.
   Las Vegas officials have said for years that the city needed a
major theme park to help attract families. A water theme park,
built on the Las Vegas Strip five years ago, has been extremely
successful.
   ``Clearly the theme park idea is one that has been looked at for
quite a while,'' said Harold Vogel, veteran entertainment analyst
for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. ``It's an adult resort, and now they're
going to extend it so the rest of the family members can enjoy it
too.''
   Benninger said movie themes had proved an enduring lure to
tourists, as proved by expansions of Walt Disney Co. and MCA Inc.'s
Universal Studios into Florida movie theme parks.
   ``There has always been competition in Las Vegas,'' Benninger
said. ``I'm not worried about competition. We're building the best
mouse trap in town.''
   Benninger said MGM Grand will add 4,300 rooms to the 700-room
Marina at a cost of about $250 million. The theme park, which will
cost about $450 million, will include a working film and television
studio, although he said it might have just one sound stage.
   It is anticipated that the complex will employ 7,000 workers.
   Other details were sketchy. A name for the complex, and even its
designers, have yet to be selected. Benninger wouldn't reveal
details about the attractions being considered, although he said
there were many.
   He said ``two or three organizations'' had approached him about
possible partnerships and left open the possibility of finding
another partner.
   Benninger said MGM Grand regarded the development as a prototype
and had already received calls from unidentified organizations
about developing similar complexes elsewhere.
   MGM Grand, a separate company from MGM-UA Communications Corp.,
owns an all-frills Los Angeles-New York airline as well as the
Desert Inn. It also retains rights to a stylized version of the
famous MGM lion.
   Kerkorian, 72, had sold and bought back bits and pieces of
MGM-UA Communications for two decades, a period during which he
also traded Las Vegas hotels the way most people buy cars.
   Then last month, Australia's Qintex Group agreed to purchase
MGM-UA _ including the original lion logo _ for $1.5 billion,
outbidding media mogul Rupert Murdoch by $100 million.
   A fire at the original MGM Grand Hotel, which Kerkorian built in
1973, killed 84 people in 1980. In 1985, Kerkorian sold the hotel
and its sister hotel in Reno to Bally Manufacturing Co. of Chicago
for nearly $500 million.

   Wall Street surged to a new high Tuesday as
investors, optimistic about the prospects for interest rates,
scooped up blue chip and consumer issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials achieved a new closing
high, rising 40.84 to end the session at 2,754.56. That topped the
widely-followed barometer's previous high close of 2,752.09,
reached on Sept. 1.
   Broader market indicators also scored new highs.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a margin of about
2 to 1 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 996 stocks up, 509 down and 486 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a heavy 182.55
million shares, up from 127.41 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 221.51 million shares.
   Analysts said Wall Street was awash with optimism about interest
rates as prices rose and yields slumped in the credit markets. The
Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up more than $5 in late
afternoon trading, while its yield slumped to 8.16 percent from
late Monday's 8.21 percent.
   Analysts said hopes seemed to be increasing that the Federal
Reserve might relax its credit policy further, given a relatively
slow pace of economic growth and no recent sign of increasing
inflationary pressures.
   The Fed's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee,
was meeting Tuesday, but the central bank followed its usual
procedure and did not announce any decisions.
   Strength in the dollar, which withstood central bank
intervention, also bolstered prices on Wall Street Tuesday.
   Ralph J. Acampora, a market analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.,
said traders were upbeat to the point that they ignored some of the
financial markets' recent worries, such as weakness in junk bonds.
   ``This market's turning a cold shoulder to what could be
concerning news for investors,'' he said.
   Analysts reported some program trading, but the broad advance
``despite the negatives is telling us that there's a lot of
interest out there,'' Acampora said.
   The market extended the gains it chalked up late in Monday's
session, when the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 21 points.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE Tuesday was USX,
which jumped 1] to 36\ amid speculation that financier Carl Icahn
was adding to his 11.4 percent stake in the company.
   Boeing was up 3[ to 59} as the company's unionized machinists
voted on whether to accept a new three-year contract or strike at
midnight. After the market closed, it was announced that the
machinists had turned down their tentative agreement with Boeing.
   Besides the blue chips, the biggest winners were consumer
stocks, which boast predictable growth. American Express gained 2\
to 38\ and Philip Morris soared 5] to 172.
   But those gains came at the expense of technology issues.
   IBM skidded 2| to 106. Analysts said the computer maker was
suffering the fallout from last week's announcement that its
third-quarter earnings would be below expectations.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $32.764 billion, or 0.95
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
reached a new closing high, rising 1.94 to 196.84.
   New ground was also broken at the American Stock Exchange, where
the market value index closed at 393.02, up 3.36.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index moved up 4.42 to 404.44, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 3.84 to close at 354.71.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.09 to 477.28.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Rise Amid Panama Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices rose Tuesday, supported by
concern about the unrest in Panama.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, gained 12 cents to close at $20.13 per
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Analysts said prices were buoyed by the turmoil in Panama, where
soldiers opposed to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega seized his
headquarters in an attempt to oust him but loyalists
counterattacked. Oil investors worried that the conflict could
disrupt the movement of oil tankers through the Panama Canal,
although they recognized that event still appears unlikely.
   ``What we did not see was tremendous panic, (but) it lent a
steady tone to the market,'' said Jerry Samuels, a vice president
at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., referring to the impact of the
Panama situation.
   Home heating oil futures traded on the mercantile exchange also
rose. The November contract for heating oil edged up 0.10 cent a
gallon to close at 59.68 cents and subsequent months posted larger
gains.
   The November contract for unleaded gasoline slipped 0.16 cent a
gallon to 56.64 cents. Subsequent months advanced, however, with
the December contract gaining 0.38 cent to 55.08 cents.
   Samuels said refined product prices drew further strength from
reports that Amerada Hess Corp., which owns a big refinery in St.
Croix, Virgin Islands, was experiencing delays in getting the
facility back to normal operations in the wake of damage by
Hurricane Hugo.

<HEAD>Bentsen Seeks Oil, Gas Tax For Wetlands Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairmen of the Senate Finance and Energy
committees have included a new tax on off-shore oil and gas
production in pending legislation and want to use the millions of
dollars in expected revenues to protect and restore coastal
wetlands.
   Spokesmen for the oil and gas industry say, however, that
drilling on the outer-continental shelf has done little to harm the
Gulf Coast's troubled wetlands. They said their industry is opposed
to being solely responsible for financing the proposed Coastal
Wetlands Trust Fund under the provision backed by the chairmen,
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and Bennett Johnston, D-La.
   ``Since most of the causes of wetlands losses were unintended
consequences of activities that provided public benefits, an
equitable solution would be to fund wetlands conservation programs
out of general revenues. It is unfair to tax a single industry to
address a broad land-use problem,'' Joseph Lastelic, a spokesman
for the American Petroleum Institute, said Tuesday.
   Environmentalists, however, say off-shore drilling has damaged
coastal wetlands in Louisiana and Texas, and although
outer-continental shelf drilling may not directly cause wetlands
erosion, setting up and operating support facilities on the
mainland have contributed to losses of coastal marshes.
   Under the plan drafted by Bentsen and Johnston, D-La.,
production from federal offshore waters would be taxed at 2 cents
per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas and 3 cents per barrel of oil.
   Industry estimates say the plan would raise about $100 million
annually, while the senators say revenues would be closer to $383
million over five years.
   The plan is included in Bentsen's version of what is known as
budget reconciliation legislation pending before the Finance
Committee, of which Bentsen is chairman. There have been no
hearings on the plan.
   Johnston said late Monday that getting the tax included in the
reconciliation bill was ``the difficult part'' of moving the plan
through the Senate.
   The bill is the chief legislative vehicle for enacting spending
cuts to meet budget targets.
   According to a fact sheet from Johnston's office, wetlands loss
on the Gulf Coast is critical, especially in Louisiana. Johnston's
office also said oil and gas activity is one cause of erosion in
coastal wetlands, which provide habitat for migratory birds, fish
and other ildlife, as well as commercial and recreational benefits.
   ``Navigation, access and pipeline canals and other activities
related to the exploration, development and production of oil and
gas along the Gulf Coast and on the outer continental shelf have
had adverse effects on many of the coastal wetlands of the Gulf
Coast region,'' Johnston's office said.
   ``Oil and gas production in the coastal areas have contributed
(to wetlands losses). I wouldn't say it's the No. 1 factor, but
they have contributed their part,'' said Bill Reffalt, refuge
program director for the Wilderness Society.
   Mike Baly, executive vice president of the American Gas
Association, said natural gas is ``probably less than 10 percent of
the problem.''
   Baly said the natural gas industry would pay the greatest share
of the tax _ accounting for 91 percent of what the association
projects will be $98 million in annual revenues.
   ``At a time when 50 percent of our oil comes from foreign
countries and concern about reducing our deficit from oil imports,
it's difficult for us to understand why they're lessening the
competitive factor for natural gas by applying a federal tax,''
Baly said.
   Scott Feierabend, director of the fisheries and wildlife
division at the National Wildlife Federation, said he would support
the Bentsen-Johnston approach.
   Bentsen said Monday his plan would ``be a great thing for the
coastal waters, Louisiana, Texas and the United States.''

<HEAD>Crazy Eddie Says It Will Liquidate Remaining Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Crazy Eddie Inc., the discount electronics
chain known for its high-pitched commercials, turned down the
volume for good Tuesday, announcing it would liquidate its last 18
stores.
   The company, which had been seeking to reorganize under Chapter
11 of the bankruptcy laws, said it would liquidate because vendors
were no longer willing to extend credit, among other factors.
   Without the credit, it could not keep operating, the company
said. Because liabilities greatly exceeded assets, stockholders
would receive nothing, it said. Trading had been suspended when the
share price fell below 25 cents.
   Managers were told of the planned closings during a morning
meeting at the company's headquarters in Edison, said Humphrey
Stokes, manager of the Crazy Eddie store here.
   ``It was kind of like a load being lifted off your shoulders,''
he said.
   The announcement ends a turbulent 20-year history for the
company founded by high-school dropout Eddie Antar with a lone
store in Brooklyn, N.Y. At its peak, Crazy Eddie had 43 stores in
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.
   They employed 1,500 people and once brought in sales of $300
million. The company's stock reached $21 a share. The tag line
``Our prices are insane,'' screamed so often on television and
radio spots by former disc jockey-actor Jerry Carroll, made the
chain known to millions.
   But a rift among Antar family members who served as executives,
declining demand for electronics, tougher competition and seeming
disorganization brought on severe financial woes.
   Antar, who brought the company public in 1984, later sold much
of his stock, and resigned as president but stayed on as chairman.
He dropped from sight and never granted interviews.
   Dissident shareholders, led by turnaround specialist Victor
Palmieri and Houston electronics retailer Elias Zinn, took control
of the company in November 1987 and found a huge inventory
shortfall.
   Nearly three months after Crazy Eddie sought bankruptcy
protection in June, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused
Antar and top management with insider trading and systematically
doctoring financial figures to inflate earnings.
   The scheme allegedly involved exaggerating inventory and falsely
reducing bills to suppliers.
   Meanwhile, at the store here, the floor contained compact disc
players and other stereo equipment in their boxes and pyramids of
Mr. Coffee machines. Stokes said he wanted to show customers that
the store had goods to sell, but conceded that the stock room was
far from brimming over.
   ``This is my job, my livelihood,'' said Stokes. ``But you've got
to make the best of it,'' he said, confident he could find work in
the computer industry. Stokes vowed to go out of business in the
``Crazy Eddie tradition'' _ ``blow-out blitzes.''

   The Senate voted Tuesday to cut off debate on
long-stalled legislation that would require creation of a
commission to investigate the lengthy Eastern Airlines strike.
   Senators voted narrowly to invoke cloture, getting 61 votes,
just one more than necessary to limit debate. Thirty-six senators
voted against ending the filibuster by Senate Republicans.
   The Republicans had been backing President Bush's refusal to
appoint an emergency board, under provisions of the Railway Labor
Act, to probe the strike, led by Machinists, which began March 4.
   A spokesman for Eastern termed ``ludicrous'' the legislation
being considered by the Senate.
   ``It's hard to believe at a time when the Senate is so bogged
down in matters of great importance to the country, that it would
take this much time to deal with ludicrous legislation on behalf of
special interests,'' said Robin Matell from Eastern's headquarters
in Miami.
   Bush has said he would veto such a bill, and there are ``more
than enough'' votes in Congress to sustain a presidential veto,
Matell said.
   In a separate development Tuesday, a federal bankruptcy judge in
New York released $75 million from escrow to Eastern and gave the
troubled carrier permission to sell a $30 million note that it owns.
   The Senate action breaks a parliamentary jam holding up
consideration of a measure mandating establishment of a
three-person commission to study the work stoppage and make
recommendations for its solution.
   There was no immediate indication when the Senate would proceed
to a vote on the bill. Under cloture rules, no senator may talk for
more than an hour after debate has been cut off. This usually means
there would be no more than 30 to 40 hours of further debate, since
it takes 60 senators in the 100-member chamber to invoke cloture.
   Democrats had said last week that if they were successful in
achieving a cutoff of debate, they would then substitute
union-backed language for the House-passed bill, creating a
commission with one member each appointed by Bush, Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash.
   ``I think, in fairness, we should invoke cloture,'' Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, told colleagues before Tuesday's vote. ``I
believe that we owe nothing less to the workers of Eastern
Airlines.''
   Since March, Republican members of the Senate have used delaying
tactics to block the chamber's consideration of House-passed
legislation requiring Bush to appoint an emergency board. The
president has refused to create a board, saying management and
employees should resolve the problem.
   But Metzenbaum said it was time to force Bush's hand.
   ``It is now obvious that the president will not appoint an
emergency board,'' he said. ``It is now obvious that unless
Congress takes action, the president is content to do nothing ...
while the families of 30,000 Eastern workers suffer.''
   Five days after the Machinists struck Eastern, joined by pilots
and flight attendants, the carrier filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Eastern has been continuing
efforts to reorganize in bankruptcy court and the airline has said
it plans to emerge as a carrier two-thirds its former size.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies
Tuesday despite continued central bank intervention as the crisis
in Panama boosted the U.S. currency. Gold prices declined.
   Foreign exchange analysts said intervention by the Federal
Reserve and other central banks continued but at a less aggressive
pace than last week.
   The Group of Seven industrialized nations agreed more than a
week ago to sell dollars and buy other currencies in a concerted
effort to drive the dollar lower.
   ``The dollar was well bid throughout the entire day today,''
said Jeff Montschein, managing director of foreign exchange at
Continental Bank in Chicago. ``The intervention was across the
board but it wasn't massive.''
   The seven nations in the group are the United States, Britain,
Japan, France, West Germany, Italy and Canada.
   Currency analysts said the dollar's rise was led by a failure to
push up the struggling yen.
   ``The dollar was well bid because of the yen,'' said Marcy
Nathan, analyst with Hill Samuel International Banking Corp. ``When
it was unable to hold at 140 and broke above due to strong dollar
demand, we saw a good variety of short covering which brought the
dollar-yen up further.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.35 yen to a closing 140.65 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 141.10 yen, up from 139.25 late
Monday. In New York, the dollar traded at 141.20 yen, up from
139.70.
   News that the goverment of Panama might have been overthrown in
a coup also gave the dollar a slight kick, currency traders said.
U.S. government officials later reported that the coup had failed.
   ``It was the flight-to-safety phenomenon,'' Nathan said.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6055 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6175 late Monday. The
pound fell to $1.6045 compared with $1.6135 in New York trading.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8865 West German marks, up from 1,8795; 1.6350
Swiss francs, up from 1.6285; 1.1749 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1782; 6.4000 French francs, up from 6.3745; and 1,379.65 Italian
lire, up from 1,3740.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Monday's rates,
included: 1.8865 West German marks, up from 1.8750; 1.6350 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6240; 6.4005 French francs, up from 6.3595;
2.1195 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1140; 1,380.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,366.50; and 1.1763 Canadian dollars, down from 1.7772.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $365.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $366.50.
   In Zurich, gold closed at a bid $365.25 compared with $366.40
late Monday. Gold in Hong Kong fell 75 cents to close at a bid
$366.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $366.30 an ounce, down from $367.60 on Monday.
Later Republic National bank of New York said gold was bid at
$365.50 an ounce, down from Monday's $366.10.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $5.22 a troy ounce, compared
with Monday's $5.23.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for December delivery rose
to $5.305 from $5.303.

<HEAD>Activity to Increase This Year, Decline in 1990, Survey Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least a third of the major oil and gas
companies plan to spend more on exploration and production this
year, but most forecast a drop in prices and activity in 1990, an
industry report said Tuesday.
   Thirty-three percent of the major integrated companies
responding to PI's annual mid-year survey said exploration
expenditures this year would exceed those of 1988, while 22 percent
said the expenditures would decrease, according to Petroleum
Information, a Denver-based research arm of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.
   Thirty-nine percent of the independent operators said they would
spend more on exploration, 21 percent said they would spend less
and 40 percent said spending would be unchanged, PI said.
   For the first three quarters of 1989, new field wildcat
completions declined 31 percent from the same period in 1988.
However, the operators' spending expectations, coupled with
depressed levels of exploration activity earlier this year,
indicate increased exploration in the fourth quarter, the report
said.
   Forty-three percent of the companies surveyed said
production-related expenditures would increase, 38 percent planned
no change and 17 percent said they would decrease, PI said.
   Operators forecast a drop in prices and activity next year with
the price for West Texas Intermediate crude expected to average
$17.45 a barrel, compared with the 1989 year-to-date average of $19
per barrel; the average spot price of natural gas would be $1.57
per thousand cubic feet, compared with the 12-month average to date
of $1.60, the company said.
   The companies predicted that the Baker-Hughes 1990 U.S. rig
count would average 859 in 1990, compared with the most recent
count of 978, PI said.
   The survey said 44 percent of the major integrated companies
reported their No. 1 geographic focus would be domestic offshore
prospects next year, followed by domestic onshore and international
prospects.
   Eighty-five percent of the independent operators said domestic
onshore targets would be their No. 1 priority, and 8 percent said
their leading focus would be offshore prospects. The remaining
operators said they would focus on international prospects.
   The survey findings supported a widely perceived shift toward
natural gas production with 51 percent of the respondents saying
they would emphasize gas prospects over oil.
   Nearly 69 percent of the respondents said their plans called for
at least an even split between oil and natural gas. PI said 51
percent of the 1988 survey respondents said they planned such a
split.

analysis and other exploration services to petroleum and related
industries.

   The striking machinists union offered
Tuesday to resume talks with John Deere &amp; Co. on a new contract.
   ``The union is ready to meet, at their convenience,'' said
Dwayne Scott, a spokesman for International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 873.
   There was no immediate response from Deere, a manufactuer of
farm equipment.
   The union, which represents 940 workers at Deere's Horicon plant
and another 225 on layoffs, walked out Sunday after their old
contract expired.
   The union's negotiating committee had recommended acceptance of
the company's contract offer, but the tentative pact was voted down
by the rank and file on Saturday, Scott said.
   Scott said a key issue was job security, although some members
said they also wanted pay parity with other John Deere plants.
   The average pay for union workers is $15 an hour, Scott said.
   Deere, based in Moline, Ill., manufactures farm tractors and has
other plants in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Colorado and Georgia.
   The Horicon plant is the only one whose workers are not
represented by the United Auto Workers.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George E. and Joan B. Johnson started one of the
nation's largest black-owned companies together with $250 in 1954,
but the family ties that bound the company and the couple have come
undone.
   Johnson signed the company chairmanship and the bulk of its
shares over to her this week in their divorce settlement.
   Johnson Products makes hair-care and cosmetics under such brand
names as Gentle-Treatment, Ultra Sheen and Classy Curl.
   ``This is a family company and she wanted to preserve the
company for the family, the children. And she obviously feels that
she can make this company into something even better than it is
today,'' Bernard Rinella, Ms. Johnson's divorce lawyer, said
Tuesday.
   She and the couple's eldest son, Eric G. Johnson, will seek to
guide Johnson Products Co. back to profitability after eight
straight years of losses, he said.
   The company's stock closed up 12{ cents Tuesday at $2.50 a share
on the American Stock Exchange.
   Johnson, 62, who had been the company's principal shareholder,
turned his stock over to his former wife and resigned as chairman
and chief executive officer on Monday, when the divorce was granted.
   Ms. Johnson, 60, formerly the company treasurer, replaced him as
chairman and now owns or controls 61 percent of the
personal-product company's common stock.
   Eric Johnson, who has been president of the company since
December, was named chief executive officer.
   George Johnson will stay on as a consultant. He also is chairman
of the holding company that owns Independence Bank of Chicago and
Drexel National Bank in Chicago.
   The changes were approved Monday by Johnson Products' board of
directors.
   Alvin J. Boutte, chairman of Independence Bank of Chicago and a
member of the Johnson Products board of directors, declined to
elaborate on the move.
   ``This was strictly a family affair. They amicably agreed to do
it this way,'' said Boutte.
   He added he did not expect radical changes at the company.
   ``Eric has really been running the company on a day-to-day
basis,'' Boutte said.
   Other terms of the settlement were not disclosed, and Rinella
said the divorce records were impounded and not available to the
public.
   George Johnson's attorney, Robert Hirsch, did not return
telephone calls to his office.
   Neither George nor Joan Johnson could be reached through the
company on Tuesday.
   Rinella said Johnson Products, which is completing an internal
reorganization begun 18 months ago, would benefit from the
management change.
   ``I think she can turn it around,'' he said.
   The divorce action had been pending for more than a year while
the two sides discussed terms of the settlement, including the
change in ownership of the company, Rinella said.
   Asked whether George Johnson had considered selling the company
instead of turning it over, Rinella said it ``could have been an
option ... but that never developed.''
   The Johnsons founded the company in Chicago, and it became the
first black-owned company traded on the American Stock Exchange in
1971.
   While the company has lost money for the past eight years, it
posted small gains in the past two quarters.
   The company reported a loss of $3.7 million on sales of $29.1
million in fiscal 1988. The company registered a $2.2 million
one-time gain in the first quarter of its 1989 fiscal year after
selling land near its South Side headquarters.
   Johnson Products was 17th on this year's list of the nation's
100 largest black-owned companies, compiled by Black Enterprise
magazine.

<HEAD>Legal Specialist: Retirees May Be Out of Reach of Age Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $35 million age discrimination settlement _
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's largest ever _ may be
out of reach for 4,000 Westinghouse Electric Corp. retirees
following two Supreme Court decisions, a legal specialist said.
   The Supreme Court on Monday vacated an appeals court ruling that
Westinghouse discriminated against the retirees by offering them a
choice of either severance pay or early pensions, but not both.
   The appeals court must now reconsider EEOC's charges against
Westinghouse, in light of a June Supreme Court ruling that tilts
the discrimination law in favor of employers.
   The EEOC had a $35 million settlement in hand in August 1988 but
walked away from it to seek a court ruling that could have led to
an even bigger payment for the retirees.
   ``It means they blew it. They got greedy,'' Dick Lauver, a
Pittsburgh pension lawyer who was not involved in the case, said
Monday night. ``They chose to forgo a very favorable settlement to
get a favorable court decision.''
   Donald Livingston, executive assistant to the EEOC general
counsel, said Tuesday that Lauver ``knows nothing of the settlement
and knows nothing of the settlement process and maybe he's not
adequately familiar with the case.''
   Livingston said EEOC believed that up to 10,000 Westinghouse
retirees might have qualified to share in the settlement, but the
two sides could not agree on guidelines for identifying additional
retirees.
   In addition, the settlement would have required the agency to
approve a future benefits plan that was too similar to the one the
3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals deemed illegal.
   Livingston said that ``$35 million seemed to be an inadequate
settlement.''
   The case was pending before the federal appeals court when the
two sides settled. After the EEOC backed away, the appeals court
took up the case again and ruled against Westinghouse. The company
appealed to the Supreme Court early this year.
   The Supreme Court's June ruling came in an Ohio case. The court
said employees have the burden of proving that the employer
intended to discriminate. Before the decision, employers had to
demonstrate why the disputed programs were not discriminatory.
   ``The law is much more beneficial to Westinghouse than it was in
June,'' Livingston said. ``Right now, I don't know what this case
is worth.''
   A number of issues remain to be decided in the Westinghouse
case, he said.
   ``I think the case is far from over,'' Livingston said.
   The June ruling could affect about 30 cases pending in the
courts, said EEOC spokeswoman Deborah Graham. An additional 406
complaints still being investigated by the EEOC could also be
affected, she said.
   Three bills have been introduced in Congress that would restore
the law to its terms before the Supreme Court's June decision,
although not all of them would be retroactive.
   Westinghouse, meanwhile, is looking forward to having the
appeals cour reconsider its case, said company spokesman Jim
Schmitt.
   ``Westinghouse is delighted,'' he said.

   Construction is to begin in December 1990, when Shell moves out
of the existing building, and should be completed by spring 1993,
Kaufman &amp; Broad said.

<HEAD>Sony Would Pay Guber Up to $14.1 Million to Run Columbia Pictures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. intends to pay Hollywood producer
Peter Guber and his partner as much as $14.1 million apiece over
five years to run Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., it was
disclosed Tuesday.
   The tentative deal is dependent, however, on Guber and partner
Jon Peters' ability to get out of a five-year movie-making contract
with Warner Communications Inc.
   Last week Sony agreed to acquire Columbia Pictures for $3.4
billion and to pay $200 million for Guber-Peters Entertainment Co.,
a film and television production company that Guber and Peters head.
   Guber and Peters recently signed five-year contracts to make
films for Warner, including a sequel to Warner's summer box office
smash, ``Batman.''
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sony
disclosed that it had entered into an agreement with Guber and
Peters that would pay them each $2.75 million a year for the first
30 months of a five-year contract and $2.90 million a year for the
remaining 30 months, ending March 31, 1995.
   The salary will be ``adjusted annually to reflect the increase,
if any, in the cost of living,'' according to the filing.
   In addition, Guber, Peters and ``a group of individual
executives not to exceed five'' to help them manage the new company
will be entitled to ``a portion of a bonus pool based on the
earnings before interest and taxes of (the new company) and an
equity participation based on a set formula pursuant to which the
management will be entitled to receive in the aggregate up to 8.08
percent of the increase in a formula-based market value of (the new
entity) over a five-year period,'' the SEC filing said.
   Guber and Peters would be paid less if Sony does not acquire
Guber-Peters Entertainment, according to the filing.
   But Sony reserved the right to terminate the merger agreement
with Guber-Peters Entertainment if the pair have not obtained a
written waiver to their Warner contract ``in form and substance
satisfactory'' to Sony by midnight, Oct. 25.
   ``As of the date of this offer to purchase, discussions are in
progress among the relevant parties concerning the terms on which
such release might be obtained and there can be no assurance that
the Warner waiver will be obtained,'' the filing stated.

<UNK>ICH Sells Off Some Insurance Holdings To Hicks, Muse and Others,</UNK>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ICH Corp. announced Tuesday a restructuring of its
holdings through the sale of all but two of its insurance
subsidiaries, including a $495 million deal with an investor group
put together by a former partner in the Hicks &amp; Haas leveraged
buyout firm.
   Hicks, Muse &amp; Co. said it would purchase four operating
companies with assets of $2 billion from Louisville, Ky.-based ICH.
Hicks, Muse had offered in July to take over the entire company for
$425 million in cash and the assumption of $1.69 billion in debt
and preferred stock.
   The announcement was made after the close of stock trading.
ICH's stock had edged down 12{ cents to $5.25 a share on the
American Stock Exchange.
   The Dallas-based firm was formed by John R. Muse and Thomas O.
Hicks, a founding partner of Hicks &amp; Haas, which included Dr Pepper
and Seven-Up beverage companies among its acquisitions. The
partnership, which invested $4 billion during its four-year
existence, broke up on May 11, citing philosophical differences.
   ``We see real opportunities in the life insurance industry,''
Hicks said. The operating companies purchased by Hicks, Muse are
Philadelphia Life Insurance Co., based in Dallas, and three
Denver-based firms: Massachusetts General Life Insurance Co.,
Wabash Life Insurance Co., All American Life Insurance Co and Chase
National Life Insurance Co.
   The companies' headquarters will remain in Denver and current
management, including ICH president John W. Gardiner, will remain
on board, Hicks, Muse said.
   As part of the deal, ICH will purchase $35 million in preferred
stock in HMS Acquisition Corp., Hicks, Muse's purchasing vehicle,
and will own 19 percent of the common shares of HMS Acquisition.
   ICH also announced it had signed a letter of intent to sell
Great Southern Life Insurance Co. for $145 million to Financial
Holding Corp. in Kansas City, Mo.
   Both deals are subject to various regulatory approvals and are
expected to close by the end of the year.
   ICH Chairman Robert T. Shaw said the sales were part of a
restructuring plan to increase book value, cash flow and earnings.
   ICH will retain Southwest Life Insurance Co., based in Dallas,
and Bankers Life and Casualty Co., based in Chicago. The two
subsidiaries accounted for 73 percent of ICH's assets on June 30,
1989.
   ``The availability of the proceeds (of the sales) for use in
repayment of senior bank debt and the repurchase of our outstanding
debt and equity securities is vital to our commitment to improve
our shareholder value,'' Shaw said.
   ICH said it would book one-time losses of about $85 million this
year because of the deals and the writedowns of assets held by
various subsidiaries.

   The outlook for higher TV prices bodes well in the near term for
Zenith, which is the last major TV manufacturer based in the United
States and the second-biggest seller of color TVs. But Zenith's
long-term survival in consumer electronics depends on its ability
to develop innovative products while keeping its costs low and its

   Merck &amp; Co. Inc. announced Tuesday an
agreement to acquire the shares of Britcair Ltd., a 4-year-old
British company that has developed a wound dressing from seaweed.
   Merck did not disclose terms of the agreement, but said it would

   A Merck news release said BritCair's seaweed wound dressings are
superior to cotton gauze dressings for use on wounds such as dermal
ulcers and also wounds caused by skin grafts.
   BritCair, with headquarters in Aldershot, England, uses a new
technology for the production of a gelatinous fiber. Dressings
produced from this fiber interact with wound fluids to form a gel
over the wound and help it heal better, according to the Merck
release.

   Digital Equipment Corp. on Tuesday
announced the resignation of senior vice president John J. Shields,
described as the No. 2 man at one of the world's largest computer
companies.
   Shields, 51, made a personal decision to leave the company to
pursue other interests, a statement from Digital said.
   ``Jack was instrumental in creating the 70,000-person
international sales and services organization that helped make
Digital the world's second largest computer company,'' said Digital
President Kenneth Olsen.
   Olsen said Shields ``played a key role in formulating the
company's sales, services, and marketing strategy.''
   The company's release contained no statement from Shields, who
was unavailable for comment at Digital, and his home address was
not available.
   Digital's stock fell $2.25 a share to $88.75 Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Sonny Monosson, who publishes a newsletter covering Digital's
activities, said that for many years, Shields was being groomed as
a successor to Olsen.
   But recently, he said, Shields became less visible at the
company.
   ``It was pretty obvious something was up,'' Monosson said. He
publishes The Monosson Report in Boston.
   Monosson said Shields apparently believed he could not attain
the No. 1 spot and so decided to leave.
   ``There were some indications that Shields' responsibilities had
been off-loaded to other individuals in the Digital hierarchy,''
said Paul Zorfass, director of research at the Yankee Group in
Boston.
   Nikki Richardson, a Digital spokeswoman, said Shields' decision
was made for personal reasons and any other comments were
speculation.
   Shields joined the company in 1961 as a field service engineer
and in 1964 was named manager of field service. In 1974, he was
promoted to vice president of field service and training.
   He continued to expand his duties and in 1986 was named senior
vice president in sales, services, marketing and international
business.

<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Corp. on Tuesday unveiled
new ads for its Infiniti luxury car line that finally gives a
glimpse _ if a fuzzy one _ of a nameplate previously wrapped in
advertising mystery.
   The new ads are to begin appearing later this month as part of a
$60 million print and television campaign by the Japansese
automaker that so far has lacked direct reference to either of the
two Infiniti models.
   The new television commercials continue the style of pastoral
scenery but now include a blurry car whizzing past at the close.
   The changes in the ad campaign begin Oct. 16 nationally and Oct.
23 in the 30 markets where there are Infiniti dealers, Infiniti
Division General Manager William Bruce said.
   He said more commercials will air Nov. 5 but declined to say
whether the Infiniti Q45 or M30 cars would appear in them. The cars
go on sale Nov. 8.
   The Infiniti cars are the second Japanese luxury car line to be
introduced this year in the United States. Toyota Motor Corp. began
selling its Lexus line last month. Lexus officials have said they
anticipate selling around 70,000 vehicles in 1990.
   Nissan, which changed its name from Datsun earlier this decade,
is attempting to make the name Infiniti familiar to potential
buyers before the car itself, using brand rather than product
advertising.
   ``I find them a breath of fresh air and rather intriguing,''
said automotive analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. ``I
hear everybody talking about it. I suppose you have to give them
credit in breaking new ground in automotive advertising.''
   But analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. said, ``My
personal belief is that to sell a car, you should show a car.''
   The new ads were shown at what Nissan called the national media
introduction of the Infiniti cars, which will sell for $23,500 and
$38,000. The cars also were shown on the auto-show circuit earlier
this year. Bruce declined to say how many cars the division
expected to sell.
   The line's print ads to date have shown such nature-oriented
scenes as an outcropping of rocks, crashing waves or a field of hay
along with often-philosophical text that does not prominently
mention the name of the car.

<HEAD>Big Insurer to Reorganize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers Insurance Group Inc. said Tuesday it
would consolidate its property-casualty operations as part of a
major management reorganization.
   Farmers Chairman Leo E. Denlea Jr. also said the company would
conduct a multimillion-dollar study to examine how to make its
computerized business systems more efficient.
   H.J. Browning, a vice president of field operations, was
promoted to senior vice president and chief information officer to
oversee the study, reporting to Denlea.
   Leading the host of new jobs and reassignments, Denlea said he
had appointed William H. Braddock to a new No. 2 post as executive
vice president of the Los Angeles-based insurer. The move will
allow Denlea to concentrate more on life insurance and the
reorganization of business systems, officials said.
   Denlea said he also would nominate Braddock, formerly the vice
president of marketing, to the board of directors.
   Farmers spokesman Jeffrey Beyer said the restructuring was part
of a process that Denlea launched two years ago and was unrelated
to the uncertainties surrounding a hostile takeover bid for
Farmers' parent, the British BAT Industries PLC conglomerate.
   Farmers, the 15th-biggest U.S. insurer, was acquired last year
by London-based BAT, which is now trying to fight off a $22 billion
takeover bid by Hoylake Investments, a consortium put together by
investor Sir James Goldsmith.
   If Goldsmith succeeds in the takeover, he has agreed to sell
Farmers to a French insurer, Axa-Midi Assurances, for $4.5 billion.
   Farmers expanded into its 27th state last year, Tennessee, and
Beyer said the company is considering moving into Alabama and
Georgia as well as plotting how to strengthen its operations in
such Midwest states as Minnesota and Wisconsin.
   Reporting to Braddock under the reorganization will be the field
operations vice presidents for Farmers' California, Midwest and
Western zones, and the vice presidents of claims, marketing and
commercial insurance underwriting.
   Also reporting to him will be a new vice president for the
property-casualty staff, who will supervise officers in charge of
the actuarial, underwriting and administrative services functions,
the company said.

<HEAD>Poultry Firm Says Contract Signed To Supply Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGDALE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poultry giant Tyson Foods Inc. of
Springdale said Tuesday it had signed a contract to provide chicken
parts to the Soviet Union.
   Tyson spokesman Jim Blair said the contract was signed with
another U.S. food company, which he declined to name, that has
agreed to supply the Soviet Union with chicken. Blair also declined
to disclose volume or price figures, saying non-disclosure of that
information was part of the contract.
   ``The Russians have committed themselves to a major purchasing
program of consumer items, including food, and this is simply part
of the program,'' said Blair, Tyson's general counsel.
   He declined to say when the contract was signed, but said it was
announced to Tyson management Monday.
   According to Blair, the contract calls for a substantial amount
of frozen chicken hindquarters _ thighs and legs _ to be shipped in
containers to U.S. ports, where the containers would be transferred
to cargo ships for transport to the Soviet Union.
   Shipments are to begin ``almost immediately,'' he said.
   The effect on the U.S. chicken market will be very limited, he
said.
   ``It won't do anything to the American market except add
stability, as any big contract does over a period of time,'' Tyson
said. ``In fact, there won't be any disruption in the supply to our
normal customers.''
   Blair said the contract is with a company with which Tyson
normally competes in the United States. He would not say whether
the company was either Conagra Inc. of Omaha, Neb., or Perdue Farms
Inc. of Salisbury, Md.
   The multicompany arrangement, he said, arose because ``I don't
think any single company would have the capacity to fulfill the
contract'' without disruption of its normal operations.
   He said that, as far as he knew, the arrangements with the
Soviet Union involve no export subsidy by the U.S. government. The
sale by Tyson, Blair said, was at U.S. market prices, as was the
sale to the Soviet Union by the company with which Tyson has
contracted.

   Threatening a fresh trade spat with the United
States, European foreign ministers Tuesday agreed to push their
television stations to air a majority of home-grown _ not foreign _
entertainment programs.
   The United States has argued the measure would hurt the American
film and television industry's earnings abroad and suggested it
might violate international trade rules.
   Despite strong U.S. lobbying in recent months, the foreign
ministers of the European Community approved a plan that would
remove barriers to TV broadcasting in the 12-nation trading bloc.
   Belgium and Denmark opposed the measure, according to community
spokesmen.
   Martin Bangemann, the community's top official on industrial
matters, said criticism of the measure was unjustified.
   ``It cannot constitute an infringement of international trade
rules,'' he told reporters.
   There was no immediate reaction from U.S. officials.
   The plan, Television Without Frontiers, is part of the
community's move to create a single market of 320 million consumers
in late 1992.
   By the end of 1992 the dozen nations are scheduled to remove the
many trade barriers restricting the free movement of money, goods,
services and people.
   The TV measure set out the conditions under which broadcasters
in Europe would be allowed to transmit channels throughout the
trading bloc.
   In doing so, it said governments must ensure that a majority of
transmission time be reserved _ ``where practicable and by
appropriate means'' _ for European-made programs.
   Excluded from the provision were news, sports and games programs
as well as ads.
   British Foreign Secretary John King said there were assurances
that the measure would not be regarded as applying legally binding
quotas.
   ``We clearly wanted to avoid ... a Fortress Europe and the fears
of a Fortress Europe,'' he told reporters.
   The measure, he said, was ``seen as political objectives and not
a numerical straitjacket.''
   ``It's not a legal obligation,'' said Bangemann. ``It's a
political commitment.''
   King said Britain would not change its treatment of U.S.
programs. About 15 percent of the programs broadcst by major
British stations comes from outside the community, he said.
   ``Any fans of `Dallas' or `Dynasty' need have no doubt
whatsoever that they will continue to get their programs,'' he said.
   The United States has urged the community to scrap the plan. The
American entertainment industry said its European earnings would be
seriously hurt by such a restriction.
   During a European swing last month, U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills reiterated the American opposition.
   ``We are not in favor of local content in any context and more
particularly in the province of thoughts,'' she said.
   Local content provisions refer to measures requiring that a
certain percentage of a product be produced domestically.
   Mrs. Hills had earlier written key members of the European
Parliament, the community's legislative body, to complain about the
TV measure.
   Community quotas, she wrote, ``would be blatantly
discriminatory, patently unjustifiable, and would almost certainly
have a disastrous effect on the U.S. industry's substantial
European earnings.''
   Defenders of quotas argued that European culture was at stake.
They fear a flood of American soap operas, sitcoms and other
programs would tie up the airwaves.
