   Federal legislation should not pre-empt state
law on oil spills, Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell and
three state attorneys general argued Friday.
   ``Pre-empting our state law and requiring us to ... rely on a
system administered by the federal government is not a proposal
which can be accepted by the state of Maine,'' Maine Attorney
General James E. Tierney said in testimony before a subcommittee of
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, pledged that ``there will be no federal
legislation that pre-empts state law.''
   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, testifying before
the Subcommittee on Environmental Protection, stressed that the
Bush administration favors strengthening U.S. law and supporting
ratification of two international treaties, or protocols, to
provide compensation for cleanup and damages resulting from oil
spills caused by foreign tankers.
   ``To argue that state laws offer a viable alternative to the
protocols is to ignore the facts,'' Skinner said.
   The treaties, he said, offer advantages not obtainable under
state law, such as the enforceability of U.S. judgments abroad and
consistency of limits and costs of shipowners and oil companies.
   Americans should not have to ``suffer all the costs of oil
pollution caused by foreign tankers when an international system
exists to pay for cleanup and damages,'' Skinner said. ``A vote for
the protocols is a vote for the environment.''
   Tierney disagreed.
   ``A vote for the protocols is not a vote for the environment,''
he said.
   Also opposing the protocols were Alaska Attorney General Douglas
B. Baily and Washington Attorney General Kenneth O. Eikenberry.
   ``Even if coupled with an international fund, the result would
be that in some situations, damages would go uncompensated because
state law protection is unavailable,'' Baily said.
   Kenneth R. Dickerson, an Arco Oil Co. senior vice president,
told the panel that his company supports giving the federal
government the sole responsibility for oil-spill cleanups.
   Skinner's testimony came as 17 members of the California
delegation called on Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan to resign as
head of a presidential task force studying offshore drilling.
   ``Recent comments indicate he has already decided to proceed
with offshore oil drilling. Out of fairness, he must step down,''
said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.
   Lujan told a recent meeting of the Western Governors Association
the renewed one-year ban on offshore drilling in many areas
approved by the House was a ``dangerous'' course that would
increase reliance on foreign oil.
   The California group said it was ``deeply disturbed'' by the
comments, but Lujan's spokesman, Steve Goldstein, said Friday,
``The secretary does not plan to resign from the task force.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush pledged Friday unswerving U.S.
support for captive nations _ peoples and countries that live under
foreign domination or ``ideologies that are inimical to the ideas
of national sovereignty and individual liberty.''
   Bush proclaimed Captive Nations Week, calling for all nations of
the world to guarantee human rights, freedoms and independence for
these peoples. He said the meaning of this week is ``to live
freedom, to overcome oppression.''
   The president, in a Rose Garden ceremony to mark the occasion,
cited ``rays of light'' worldwide that show changes in the Soviet
Union and other countries toward openness and free expression,
including the dismantling of the barbed wire fence between Austria
and Hungary.
   ``To all nations, America proclaims the truth cannot forever be
intimidated by force. For history shows, and the human will
proclaims, that liberty can light the darkest night,'' he said.
   Bush said the Soviet Union's Baltic States of Latvia, Lithuania
and Estonia are imbued with a ``spirit of renewal'' in their
movements for independence.
   He cited the opposition movements in China, Vietnam, Laos,
Ethiopia and Nicaragua and the ethnic Turks in Bulgaria, saying
America stands with the people involved in those struggles.
   In his Rose Garden remarks, Bush pointed to his trip last week
to Hungary and Poland, two East bloc countries that are moving
toward economic and politcal reform, saying these are examples that
``freedom is in the air.''

   Workers rescued a copper miner who
survived by eating his shirt while trapped 12 days in a tunnel by a
mudslide, a mining company said.
   Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corp. said in a
statement that Roberto Lingao-Lingao was rescued Friday.
   He survived by eating his shirt a little at a time as fellow
miners inched their way 1,473 feet through mud and other debris to
reach him, the statement said.
   Lingao-Lingao, a former soldier with training in jungle
survival, became trapped in a tunnel after intermittent heavy rain
sent tons of mud cascading down a shaft on July 8, the company said.
   The mine is in the village of Lutupan, about 22 miles from Cebu
City and 350 miles southeast of Manila.
   Lingao-Lingao suffered ``mild disorientation and extreme
weakness,'' the mining company statement said, quoting the miner as
saying he spent most of his time underground sleeping to conserve
energy.

<HEAD>Canadian Investigator: Gander Crash Will Never be Solved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada has closed the books on its worst air
disaster, concluding after three years of investigation that the
crash that killed 256 Americans in Newfoundland is a mystery never
likely to be solved.
   ``There is nothing in all these deliberations which holds out
any reasonable prospect of any more success than that achieved to
date,'' former Supreme Court Justice Willard Estey concluded in his
review released Friday.
   ``No inquiry is going to bring the deceased back,'' Estey said.
``Should we keep this book open forever?''
   Estey was appointed to review the case after an earlier
investigation board split sharply on the cause of the crash.
   He said the evidence did not support the Canadian Aviation
Safety Board's finding that ice on the wings of the Arrow Air
charter DC-8 was the probable cause of the Dec. 12, 1985, crash at
Gander, Newfoundland.
   But he likewise found no evidence to support the minority
report, signed by four of the board's nine members in December,
that an explosion or fire before impact probably caused the crash.
   ``It should be no surprise to discover that occasions do arise
when no explanation can be found for an event in which the efforts
of mankind are overwhelmed by the forces of nature,'' Estey wrote.
   Les Filotas, one of the board members who signed the minority
report, said circumstances still exist to be investigated ``outside
the four corners'' examined by Estey.
   ``A labyrinth has many more than four corners,'' he said. ``It's
very unfortunate that it's going to be closed off.''
   Transportation Minister Benoit Bouchard, who appointed Estey to
review the persistently controversial investigation in February,
said he accepted the recommendation that no further investigation
is warranted.
   ``No further physical evidence can e obtained. It is very
unlikely that any analytical approach will be uncovered which would
expose the cause,'' Estey wrote.
   The investigation was hampered by a cockpit voice recorder that
didn't work and a primitive flight recorder that tracked only four
instruments.
   Estey said at a news conference that it would be ``unproductive
and sad'' to reopen the investigation nearly four years after the
worst aviation disaster ever in Canada.
   ``You'll have the same lonely result,'' Estey said.
   The crash killed all 248 U.S. servicemen returning to Fort
Campbell, Ky., from peace-keeping duties in the Middle East, along
with eight American flight crew members.
   The review found little justification for the either of the
aviation board's conclusions.
   ``There is nothing in the evidence or the material assembled by
the board or in any of the studies prepared by or for the board
which would indicate that any further inquiry into this accident
almost four years later would determine the cause or causes with
any greater certainty,'' the review concluded.
   The review noted the references throughout the investigation to
possible terrorist involvement as a cause.
   ``Surmise and speculation inside and outside these proceedings
abound, factual evidence does not,'' the review said. ``Nothing
indicates any hope of uncovering explanations of this accident in
those areas where another inquiry to be undertaken by Canada.''
   Estey said he did not find any oversight in the board's work
that might have led to a concrete finding of what caused the crash.
   He also discounted the charges that the investigation by the
safety board, plagued throughout by internal splits, was a coverup.
   ``There's no evidence of coverup, and I wasn't appointed to
cover anything up,'' Estey said.
   Estey said the families of those who died in the crash would
deserve a continued investigation if reasonable hope of finding its
cause existed.
   But he also said that the relatives would not be served by
endlessly poring over the same material.
   Estey reviewed evidence accumulated by the safety board and did
not hold new hearings or consider new testimony.
   The aviation safety board is being replaced by an agency that
will be responsible for all types of transportation, along the
lines of the National Transportation Safety Board in the United
States.
   Kenneth Thorneycroft, the board's chairman, called the review
``very valid, very forceful.''

<HEAD>NASA Denies Nuclear-Powered Space Probe a Danger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA on Friday denied claims it will
endanger the public by launching a nuclear-powered space probe
aboard the shuttle in October.
   ``The mission as designed, analyzed and tested, is safe. Reports
to the contrary that have been circulating in the press are not
true,'' said John Casani, a deputy manager of flight projects at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   Managers of the Galileo project showed the spacecraft to
reporters in a hangar at the Kennedy Space Center where it is being
prepared for flight. At the same time, nuclear power opponents in
Washington, D.C., urged NASA to re-evaluate the potential hazards.
   The Christic Institute, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group which
opposes nuclear power on satellites, told reporters Friday it plans
to file a petition with NASA asking the agency to revise its
environmental impact statement on Galileo.
   ``The issue is that the hazards of the Galileo launch have not
been explored sufficiently,'' said Robert Richie, a spokesman for
the Christic Institute. Richie said NASA is relying on hazard
estimates from the Department of Energy which ``have been shown in
a number of cases to be flawed.''
   Galileo is scheduled for launch from the Kennedy Space Center
Oct. 12 aboard the shuttle Atlantis. The crew of Atlantis will
deploy Galileo on an eight-year mission to explore Jupiter.
   Technicians have been assembling the spacecraft since May. They
will attach Galileo to the booster on Wednesday.
   Galileo will be powered by 131 single-watt radioisotopic
thermoelectric generators _ RTGs for short _ that convert heat
created by decaying radioactive fuel into electricity. The 50
pounds of plutonium-238 that will power Galileo has raised fears of
widespread contamination from radioactive fallout in the event of
an accident.
   RTGs have been an accepted source of power for spacecraft since
the early 1960s. The intense criticism started when the 1986
explosion of space shuttle Challenger heightened public awareness
about the risks of space flight.
   To critics, an explosion like the one that destroyed Challenger
during liftoff is not the only danger. They are also afraid Galileo
will re-enter the atmosphere and break apart as it loops Earth on
its way to Jupiter.
   Atlantis commander Don Williams is undaunted by the safety
debate. ``We really have looked into this a lot, and I'm convinced
it is absolutely safe to fly,'' he said.
   Galileo will perform ``celestial gymnastics'' on its way to
Jupiter, said Spehalski. It will swing around Venus and then loop
Earth and the asteroid belt twice in the early 1990s, using their
gravity fields to gain speed before heading toward an encounter
with Jupiter in December 1995.
   About five months before reaching Jupiter, Galileo will release
a probe toward the planet. The probe will study the atmosphere and
the weather as it parachutes to the surface.
   Launching a payload containing radioactive material requires
special approval from the federal government, which NASA officials
expect to receive for Galileo by Sept. 1.

   The government of Baden-Wuerttemberg
state has contributed about $1.5 million to Jewish cultural
societies to help them recover from a multimillion-dollar
embezzlement, a newspaper reported today.
   Die Welt quoted a state government spokesman, Hartmut Reichl, as
saying the leadership of the prosperous southern state considered
it in the public interest to assist the religious groups. The money
is to be used build community centers.
   Jewish cultural societies in the state were near economic ruin
after the January 1988 death of former Jewish leader Werner
Nachmann. He has been accused of embezzling more than $15.7 million
from interest earned on Jewish reparation money.
   Much of the money remains unaccounted for, Die Welt said.
   An investigation by the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe
is nearing an end, the newspaper said.

   The unthinkable is being thought in the ruling
party: Maybe it's time to let the opposition take over, and hope
they mess up so the Liberal Democrats can return as heroes with
their scandal-tainted image refurbished.
   The Liberal Democratic Party has governed Japan since its
formation in 1955, but party leaders say it has been brought to an
unprecedented crisis by sex and money scandals and unpopular
policies.
   Sunday's elections for half the seats in the 252-member upper
house of Parliament could begin an erosion of power that eventually
will make the revolutionary thought an inevitable reality.
   Sixty-six Liberal Democratic members are ending their six-year
terms and the party must retain 54 of those seats to keep control.
Analysts and poll takers don't expect it to happen.
   ``We are very confident the LDP will lose its majority,'' said
Takashi Yonezawa, secretary-general of the Democratic Socialist
Party.
   Yonezawa's party, the fourth-largest opposition group in
Parliament, has been negotiating with the leading opposition
Socialists, the Buddhist-supported Komeito (Clean Government) Party
and the Social Democratic Federation about a possible coalition
government if the conservative Liberal Democrats lose their mandate.
   Elections for the lower house, where the real power lies, need
not be held until next year, but a Liberal Democratic loss on
Sunday could create pressure for an earlier vote. The governing
party has 243 of the 512 seats in the lower house and alliances
with smaller conservative parties give it a majority.
   The four opposition parties talking coalition have 78 seats in
the upper house, compared with 142 for the Liberal Democrats, and
must win 49 more on Sunday to gain control.
   A coalition would not be easy because they have major
differences on what changes to make in the policies of the
pro-business, pro-Western Liberal Democrats.
   At a news conference Friday, Yonezawa said Socialist policies
were ``unrealistic,'' and indicated the possibility of an alliance
with the Liberal Democrats.
   Both Yonezawa's party, which is more conservative than its name
indicates, and the Liberal Democrats say the Socialists would
cancel the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. The Socialists say they
would seek revisions.
   ``The DSP holds a balancing ticket, and, depending on the
outcome of the election, could play a pivotal role in Japan's
politics,'' the party leader said.
   Shizuo Sato, a first-term Liberal Democrat in the lower house,
expressed the view gaining currency in the governing party:
   ``If the people's decision goes against the LDP ... instead of
forming a coalition of our own, it might be better to turn the
government over to an opposition coalition.''
   ``I'm sure they'll fail and hurt the economy,'' he said in an
interview. ``Then the people will realize the value of our party.
We would also have time in the interim to regroup and resolve some
of our internal problems.''
   Sato said he does not advocate simply handing over power, but it
might have a beneficial effect ``if we have no choice because of
the way people vote. We are doing our best to see that they stay
with us.''
   After a major loss in Tokyo elections this month, Trade and
Industry Minister Seiroku Kajiyama said: ``Speaking as a lawmaker
and not a Cabinet member, I think it might be good for the party to
turn the administration over to the opposition once. That would
give us time to regroup.''
   An aide said later that Kajiyama's remarks applied to the Tokyo
city government, not national politics, but added: ``This might be
different if there are big losses in the upper house.''
   Several other Cabinet ministers have expressed similar views
privately, said political analyst Asao Yamaguchi, ``but they say so
on the condition of big losses later, in the lower house.''
   Support for the Liberal Democrats has dwindled because of a 3
percent sales tax imposed April 1, an influence-buying scandal that
caused Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to resign and allegations
that his successor, Sousuke Uno, kept several paid mistresses.
   Farmers, traditionally a reliable source of for the governing
party, have been alienated by its moves to open Japan to
agricultural imports.
   A poll published Friday by the newspaper Asahi said 28 percent
of those surveyed said they planned to vote Socialist, compared
with 21 percent for the Liberal Democrats, and 40 percent were
undecided. The nationwide poll of 2,410 people was taken July 9-10.
   Before elections three years ago, the Asahi poll put Liberal
Democrat support at 46 percent and the Socialists at 11 percent.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev is taking
home rave reviews for his unprecedented testimony bringing glasnost
to Capitol Hill.
   Akhromeyev fielded questions for nearly five hours from the
House Armed Service Committee Friday, providing data on Soviet
military spending, changes in troop deployments and arms control
positions and revealing that Soviet tank production was cut 40
percent this year, down to 1,700 tanks.
   ``I really thought it was brilliant for a man out of a system in
which there has never been very much of this sort of thing,'' said
Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis. ``He was extremely skillful.''
   Could the Soviet marshal be taken at face value?
   ``Who knows?'' Aspin replied. ``You weigh what he says against
all the other evidence, like everything else, just as you do with
any witness.''
   ``The important thing is to see if he's credible on the things
you can check,'' he said. ``If he is, he's more credible on the
things you can't.''
   A Soviet soldier since 1940, Akhromeyev became Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's chief military adviser last year after retiring as
chief of the Soviet general staff.
   The testimony was a contest of symbols, Soviet and American.
   The Red Army officer wore his marshal's uniform, olive-brown
with red piping, with large gold stars on his shoulder boards, 11
rows of decorations, a gleaming gold star perched above them.
   Around him were the formal symbols of the United States.
   A giant American eagle was emblazoned on the wall behind the
witness. The flags of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force,
each with a thick cluster of battle streamers, were draped around
the room.
   ``Never has so high-ranking a Soviet official appeared before
this committee,'' Aspin said. ``Through the years we have seen many
uniforms sit at that table _ but never one like yours.''
   Gesturing at the oil portraits of former committee chairmen _
many of whom served at the height of the Cold War _ Aspin added,
``If one or two of them look a little uncomfortable, you will have
to understand that these quickly changing times take some getting
used to.''
   Akhromeyev, obviously accustomed to Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or openness, didn't appear to have much trouble adjusting.
   When asked a question he didn't want to answer, he explained
that the Soviets have military secrets, just as the Americans do.
   At a break he patiently signed autographs, penning them on
copies of his prepared testimony.
   Responding to questions, the marshal said the reason Soviet
personnel costs were only about $7 billion last year compared to
the $78 billion paid U.S. troops was that the Soviet Union can't
afford high wages.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., asked whether
Akhromeyev was suggesting cutting the salaries of high-ranking
American officers.
   ``Oh, God forbid,'' Akhromeyev replied. ``I don't want you to
get me into a fight with American generals and admirals. I just
started becoming friends with them recently.''
   One sign of the times was hard to interpret.
   Committee staff members passed out a detailed biographical
sketch of the Soviet witness.
   A caption said it had been prepared by the Central Intelligence
Agency.

<HEAD>DC-10 Engine In Iowa Crash Involved In Repairs Day Before Flight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The DC-10 engine that investigators say may
have exploded in flight, knocking out United Flight 232's flight
control systems, was involved in repairs a day before the plane
crashed in an Iowa corn field.
   But the supervising federal investigator, who Friday confirmed
the repairs said there was no indication the work ``would have (or)
could have'' affected the engine in Wednesday's crash.
   The work was done on a pneumatic system attached to the General
Electric CF6-6 jet engine.
   Investigators this weekend were focusing on the tail section and
the engine that is mounted on the tail of the wide-bodied airliner
which crashed during an emergency landing at Sioux City, killing
more than a third of the people aboard. Authorities disagreed on
whether 293 or 295 people were on the flight.
   Government records show that since the early 1970s, DC-10s with
CF6-6 type engines have had six previous failures in which damage
extended beyond the engine.
   The engine builder and a Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman both said, however, that the CF6-6 has a good performance
record.
   David Lane, spokesman for General Electric's aircraft engine
division, said 469 CF6-6 engines are in service.
   He said they were built exclusively for the DC-10 and show a
rate of one departure delay or flight cancellation due to an engine
problem for every 2,000 flights.
   ``That's an admirable record,'' he said. Lane said the company
would have no comment on specifics of the Sioux City crash
investigation.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the CF6-6 engines have had one
shutdown about every 30,000 flying hours, which he said is a good
record. This covers instances where the engine shut down itself or
the pilot shut it down because a problem was indicated.
   CF6-6 engines have been the subject of seven FAA ``airworthiness
directives'' since they went into service in the early 1970s,
Farrar said. Such directives ordinarily order airliners to make
modifications on the engines or in procedures for maintaining them.
   The most recent order was in late 1988 and involved replacement
of an engine shaft after 17,600 flights, Farrar said.
   Flight 232's rear engine had been on the 15-year-old plane for
about nine months, said a spokesman for Rep. James Oberstar,
D-Minn., who heads a House aviation subcommittee and obtained
information about the plane from a United Airlines vice president.
   The engine either was new or newly rebuilt when it was installed
last October, said Jim Berard, Oberstar's spokesman.
   Berard said the congressman also was told the engine was in for
maintenance and fully checked the day before the flight, but he
said Oberstar had not determined whether the work could have had
anything to do with the engine failure.
   United Airlines spokesman Herb Gardner in Chicago said all
maintenance records concerning the DC-10, one of 56 in United's
fleet, had been turned over to the National Transportation Safety
Board. ``We just simply do not provide any of that information once
it's been given to the board,'' he said.
   Safety board member Jim Burnett, who is supervising
investigators in Sioux City, said maintenance work was done on the
aircraft's tail engine Tuesday, but he said, ``We have no
indication at this time that that was something that could have
affected the course of the accident.''
   He said the work was done on the plane's pneumatic system, which
uses excess pressure generated by the giant jet engine to power the
aircraft's air-conditioning system.

   Marvin Hamlisch may have three Oscars and a Tony
award, but he took a right jab to the ego when his wife, Terre
Blair, called her mother to say they were going to get married this
past spring.
   ``She said, `What's his name?' '' Mrs. Hamlisch recalled on
Friday's ``CBS This Morning.'' ``And I said Marvin Hamlisch. And
she said, `Isn't he a boxer in Las Vegas?'
   ``She thought he was Marvin Hagler, she'd never heard of him
before. Then I said to her, `No, he's a composer _ he writes songs
and he tours. And she said, `Just what this family needs, an
out-of-work songwriter.'''
   Hamlisch, 45, won a Tony for the score to ``A Chorus Line'' and
Academy Awards for the adapted score of ``The Sting'' and two more
for his work on ``The Way We Were.''
   Hamlisch said he fell in love with Ms. Blair on the phone and
proposed without having met her. They were married May 29.
   ``I said, `Will you _ sight unseen _ marry me?''' he said.
``Thankfully, she said yes.''

   A federal appeals court has refused to
reinstate a libel suit by ``Miami Vice'' star Philip Michael Thomas
against the National Enquirer for articles about his upbringing and
his family.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday upheld a U.S.
District Court ruling in the tabloid's favor.
   The National Enquirer printed an article in December 1985
describing the 1980 rape conviction of his brother, Marcus Thomas,
and the family's role in his appeal. The second article, published
in the tabloid a month later, said Philip Michael Thomas had grown
up in poverty and was a ``mama's boy.''
   The suit said the first article invaded the family's privacy and
the second was also libelous.
   U.S. District Judge William Orrick of San Francisco ruled two
years ago that the suit over the first article was filed too late,
and that the second article was not libelous.
   The appeals court said the statements in the second article were
``substantially true'' or, if untrue, did not defame the family.
   Thomas played detective Rico Tubbs on the television series.

   Singer Nicollette Larson's first job in
the music business got her closer to the industry than many young
hopefuls.
   Miss Larson boarded a bus from her native Kansas City and headed
to California 16 years ago to seek her musical fortune.
   At 21, she landed a job as a secretary for the Golden State
Bluegrass Festival. It wasn't long before Miss Larson's singing
ability overshadowed her typing speed.
   ``Actually from the time I left Kansas City until I had a hit
record was only about four years,'' she said in a recent interview.
``I was actually pretty lucky.''
   Miss Larson's first No. 1 hit, ``Lotta Love,'' was in 1978. More
recent tunes include ``Rumba Girl,'' ``Fool Me Again'' and ``I Only
Want to be With You.''

   Timothy Busfield, who portrays Elliot
Weston, the yuppie everybody loves to hate on television's
``Thirtysomething,'' says he is fond of his character.
   ``I love Elliot,'' Busfield said. ``He doesn't want to grow up,
but that's good. Why should he have to grow up?''
   Busfield, 32, is conducting a theater workshop at East Tennessee
State University for high school and college students. He is
scheduled to appear next week in a production at the school of
``Mass Appeal,'' the story of a priest and a fiery young seminary
student. Busfield plays the student.
   Actors have a job that has little to do with stardom, Busfield
said.
   ``It's not to star or to get attention or to be the most
popular, but it's to make the play work,'' he said. ``The
playwright did not have you in mind when he wrote the play.''

   Brigadier Gen. Frank K. Everest Jr., an Air
Force test pilot who set an unofficial speed record is scheduled to
be inducted into the the National Aviation Hall of Fame tonight.
   Three other aviation leaders _ Chance Vought, Adm. Marc A.
Mitscher and Lloyd C. Stearman _ were to be posthumously inducted
into the hall of fame at the ceremony led by Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio.
   Everest, who retired from the Air Force in 1973, tested many
airplanes, including the X-1, X-2, X-3, F-100, F-101, and F-102. He
attained the unofficial speed record of 1,957 mph in the X-2.
   Vought, who died in 1930, designed the UO-1, the Navy's first
catapult-launched aircraft. Mitscher, who died in 1947, made the
first aircraft takeoff and landing on the USS Saratoga in 1928.
Stearman joined with others in purchasing the Lockheed Aircraft Co.
in 1930 and later designed the Lockheed Electra. He died in 1970.

   The Bush administration's clean air bill,
already denounced by environmentalists, is now receiving criticism
from industry for its tough measures on utilities and ambitious
program for clean-fueled cars.
   ``Assertions by some that this is a weak bill are simply
ludicrous,'' William Fay, administrator of the multi-industry Clean
Air Working Group, said Friday.
   Environmentalists and their congressional supporters argued that
President Bush caved in to industry's economic concerns and
produced a watered-down bill that would not fix the nation's
worsening air pollution.
   Fay was not quite as harsh in assessing the legislation, which
Bush presented to Congress on Friday with a promise to ``make clean
air the birthright of every American.''
   The industry official said, ``The president's package
significantly strengthens the Clean Air Act to address ozone and
carbon monoxide'' pollution, as well as ``acid rain and air toxics
emissions.'' But he expressed concern that the bill moves ``in the
direction of limiting flexibility and economic growth.''
   The administration Friday defended the measure on several fronts.
   Bush invited key lawmakers to a White House ceremony at which he
formally sent the bill to Congress. He assured them it would clean
the air in U.S. cities, ``stop the degradation that's been caused
by acid rain by the end of this century'' and ``cut airborne toxic
chemicals from major sources by at least 75 percent.''
   Later, the Environmental Protection Agency assistant
administrator for air, William Rosenberg, said the government would
vigorously enforce a new law with civil and criminal penalties, and
have ``monitors at each smokestack.''
   The bill's penalties would be imposed on those who tamper with
auto pollution control equipment and on industries that exceed
emissions from smokestacks, he said.
   Rosenberg added that the EPA would not hesitate to use extreme
measures against cities failing to meet standards, including new
authority to curtail drinking water hookups _ a move that would
stop construction of new shopping centers or apartments.
   Fay complained that acid rain reduction provisions would not
only require utilities to reduce pollution from their current
generating output, but would force them into even costlier controls
if they sought to increase capacity to meet growing demand for
electricity.
   The Bush plan ``will limit growth and options available to a
utility,'' he said.
   Fay said he doubts the administration will be able to meet its
goal of starting a clean-burning fuel program for cars by 1995 in
nine heavily polluted cities. He said too much research needs to be
done with such fuels, and added that industry pushed unsuccessfully
for only a small demonstration program.
   He called the bill is ``a disincentive to make gasoline burn
cleaner.''
   ``We feel reductions in gasoline powered cars were better,'' he
said.
   General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp. and the Ford Motor Co.
issued statements Friday saying they support the proposal but that
it's provisions would be tough to meet.
   ``The administration's bill represents a very difficult
challenge, with some requirements that may exceed the auto
industry's ability to assure compliance,'' the GM statement said.
   The clean-fuels program would require sales of one million
clean-burning cars a year in specified polluted areas from the
1997-2004 model years.
   The cities are Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Milwaukee,
Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Diego, Chicago and a multi-city area
known as Greater Connecticut.

   A senior U.S. diplomat, under investigation as
a possible Soviet spy, may have caused ``a very serious breach of
security'' for the United States, according to the State Department.
   Felix S. Bloch, a 30-year career employee, reportedly was
videotaped passing a briefcase to a Soviet agent while stationed at
the U.S. Embassy in Vienna. Bloch allegedly first had contact with
the Soviets three years ago, ABC News reported Friday night.
   There was no answer at Bloch's home in an elegant Washington
apartment building Friday. Cars apparently with surveillance agents
who neighbors said were around the building earlier in the week
were not evident Friday night.
   Bloch has been placed on leave, his building pass withdrawn and
his security clearance revoked, the State Department said in a
statement.
   Bloch has not been charged with anything.
   State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman said it was
``pursuing the inquiry thoroughly in order to identify the
compromised security which has occurred and the appropriate legal
steps.''
   Officials said they believed it was the first time a U.S.
diplomat has been involved in an espionage case since the famous
Alger Hiss case of the late 1940s. There have been other cases
involving military personnel attached to embassies.
   ABC quoted unidentified State Department officials who said
``this has been a very serious breach of security.''
   Bloch was director of the Office of European Regional
Political-Economic Affairs in the department's Bureau of European
and Canadian Affairs. In that position, he would have been involved
in almost anything that dealt with two or more European countries,
including the Soviet Union.
   In Vienna, where as deputy chief of mission he had been the No.
2 official in the embassy, Bloch would have had access to all the
embassy's activities and communications.
   Vienna has been the site of the long-running and largely
unfruitful talks on conventional arms reduction in Europe, the
Mutual Balanced Force Reduction talks between the NATO alliance and
the Warsaw Pact.
   Bloch returned from Vienna about two months ago, when he was
``picked up'' by FBI agents, according to ABC.
   A department source who spoke on condition of anonymity told The
Associated Press that Bloch completed his Vienna assignment and
returned to Washington about a year ago, but that he apparently
made a return trip earlier this year.
   ABC showed pictures of men in cars at his home who, it said,
were FBI agents keeping him under 24-hour surveillance. Soviet
agents also have been watching Bloch, the network said.
   No surveillance cars were evident Friday night, but neighbor
Preston Pitts said the cars had been around for at least three
weeks.
   ``Oh they were everywhere, like ants,'' said Pitts. ``We thought
they were surveillance but we decided they couldn't be surveillance
because they were too obvious. We thought then they were protecting
him.''
   Pitts said Bloch told him months ago he was in line for a
nomination as ambassador to a South American country.
   Pitts said he had not seen Bloch, his wife or a daughter since
Thursday.
   ``I am absolutely flabbergasted. He was such a gentleman,'' he
said.
   Collins Bird, another neighbor, said, ``You never know who
you're living next door to. He's a very nice, pleasant man.''
   Bloch, a native of Austria, turned 54 Wednesday. He holds a
bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a
master's degree from the University of California at Berkeley.
   The last public edition of the department's biographical
register, published in 1974, said Bloch had served in Berlin,
Dusseldorf, West Germany and Caracas, Venezuela.
   In his State Department position, Bloch published an article in
the July-August issue of the Foreign Service Journal on U.S.
relations with the European Community.
   The network said State Department investigators believe Bloch
was dismayed that after 30 years he had not reached the rank of
ambassador.

<HEAD>Administration Prepares Step That Could Stop Iran-Contra Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of U.S. intelligence agencies
are meeting through the weekend to prepare a court statement that
could kill the Iran-Contra criminal case against a former CIA
operative.
   The Justice Department was putting together the government
affidavit that would block disclosures about some CIA programs in
the case of Joseph Fernandez, who is scheduled to go on trial
Monday on charges of lying about his assistance to Oliver North's
secret Contra supply network.
   An administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity
told The Associated Press that intelligence officials hoped to have
the affidavit ready in time for the trial Monday morning.
   Fernandez, the CIA's former station chief in Costa Rica, is the
highest-ranking employee of the agency ever to face a criminal
trial in connection with his work there.
   The intelligence officials hope to prevent disclosure of
classified information about ``three highly sensitive United States
government programs with Costa Rica,'' independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh's office said in court papers Friday. Fernandez says the
programs demonstrated Costa Rica's concern about the military
threat posed by neighboring Nicaragua.
   With a Justice Department affidavit in hand, U.S. District Judge
Claude Hilton would have no choice under federal law but to
prohibit Fernandez from using in his defense the classified
information detailed in the affidavit.
   Prosecutor Laurence Shtasel said in that event, portions of at
least one count of the four-count indictment against Fernandez
would be abandoned.
   The prosecutor said Attorney General Dick Thornburgh also is
considering a CIA request to broaden the affidavit to exclude
references at Fernandez's trial to CIA stations in various
countries.
   That step ``would have more drastic consequences'' for the case
against Fernandez, Shtasel told the judge at the court hearing in
Alexandria, Va.
   ``If the CIA's request for a broader ... affidavit is granted
the case will be untriable,'' Shtasel said in court papers filed
later in the day.
   The judge rejected a request by Shtasel to delay Monday's
starting date for the trial and the judge also turned down a motion
by Fernandez lawyer Thomas Wilson to throw out the case.
   Fernandez is accused of four criminal charges _ single counts of
obstructing the CIA inspector general's office and the
investigative Tower Commission and two counts of making false
statements.

   A House committee will consider cutting $500
million from President Bush's budget for the B-2 stealth bomber in
the newest sign of congressional opposition to the high cost of the
radar-evading aircraft.
   A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Friday the
Appropriations defense subcommittee voted to make the cuts in
closed session as part of a package of changes in Bush's defense
budget.
   The source said the panel also voted Thursday to cut Star Wars
by $1.1 million and to fund the V-22 Osprey and the F-14D fighter,
two programs the administration has earmarked for extinction.
   The measure, which now goes to the full Appropriations
Committee, also included funds to purchase 12 EA-6 jet fighters,
the source said.
   The Defense Department is asking for $4.7 billion for the B-2,
which will carry a price tag of $530 million per plane. The House
Armed Services Committee last month cut the overall request by $800
million.
   The action by the Appropriations subcommittee would still leave
$4.2 billion for the plane.
   Bush has gotten personally involved in the lobbying effort,
telling groups of congressmen at the White House this week the B-2
is necessary to the nation's security.
   In the case of the F-14D, the committee coupled its approval of
$1.3 billion for 24 planes with a recommendation to close the
production line at Grumman Corp. in Bethpage, N.Y., in three years.
   ``Instead of doing 12 this year and 12 next year, which was the
Armed Services Committee plan, we said `Fund 'em all up front,
deliver 'em over three years and begin the orderly closedown of the
line,''' the source said.
   The $500 million cut from Bush's B-2 request came from
purchasing funds, according to the source. That would leave $2.2
billion in purchasing funds for the B-2 and $2 billion for research
and development.
   The black, wedge-shaped bomber made its first successful test
flight this week, but still faces opposition from lawmakers who
fear the planes could wind up costing up to $1 billion apiece.
   The subcommittee called for $157 million for the Osprey. The
administration wants to cancel it, saying conventional helicopters
could serve the same purpose as the tilt-wing rotorcraft, which
takes off like a helicopter and flies like a plane.
   On Star Wars, the Strategic Defense Initiative, the subcommittee
called for $3.5 billion, considerably less than the $4.6 billion
Bush proposed.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee voted last week to accept
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's proposal to eliminate the F-14D.
   Long Island, N.Y., legislators have been lobbying hard all year,
trying to keep the F-14D alive on the grounds that closing the line
would cost some 5,100 jobs on Long Island and would effectively put
the Grumman Corp. out of the aircraft business. Grumman also builds
the EA-6 jet fighter.

<HEAD>Electricians Failed to Turn on Runway Lights During Rainstorm, Official
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot of a Philippine Airlines
plane that crashed on a busy highway ignored air traffic
controllers who warned him not to land in a heavy rainstorm,
airport officials said today.
   Officials also said that electricians apparently failed to turn
on runway lights to assist the pilot as he brought the plane in for
landing at the Manila airport.
   At least eight people were killed on the ground Friday and 91
others, mostly passengers, were injured when the twin-engine BAC
1-11 jet overshot a runway, plowed through a concrete wall and
bounced onto Manila's South Expressway Friday.
   The plane, carrying 98 people, slammed into at least four
vehicles on the 12-lane highway and careened onto some railroad
tracks, witnesses said.
   Thirty of the injured remained hospitalized today, one in
critical condition, said airline spokesman Enrique Santos.
   The plane was attempting to land in Manila after traveling from
Zamboanga City, 540 miles southeast of Manila.
   ``At that time, the pilot was given instructions to pull up,
based on the analysis of the controller that he was not going to
make it,'' Rudy Flores, control tower supervisor, told The
Associated Press. ``The pilot did not acknowledge and instead of
pulling up, he continued to descend ... Unluckily enough, he did
not make it. He overshot the runway.''
   Rolando Estabillo, another airline spokesman, declined comment
on the allegation. Santos said earlier that the pilot, Capt.
Ricardo Misa, had been cleared for landing ``when runway is in
sight.''
   Rose Reyes, Flores' deputy, acknowledged that such clearance was
given, but said it was before the weather suddenly deteriorated.
She said the clearance was given when the plane last radioed the
tower while the aircraft was at least 5 miles away.
   The instructions were changed when the weather suddenly
deteriorated and controllers, who were keeping track of the
aircraft, determined he could not make it safely, officials said.
   ``At that time he was still very high but he was above the
runway already,'' Flores said.
   Ms. Reyes said the runway lights were not on because it was
mid-afternoon. But after the skies darkened and rain began falling
in sheets, tower controllers asked airport electricians to turn on
the runway lights to help guide the plane.
   ``They told us the lights were on, that's it's okay, but when we
saw that there were no runway lights, we called them again,'' Ms.
Reyes said. ``There may have been something wrong with the lights,
maybe the cables. We don't know.''
   She and Flores declined to make further statements, saying an
investigation was under way.

   Some state officials want Congress to resist
pressure from the Exxon Valdez accident and allow local authorities
to decide how to handle oil spills.
   The attorneys general from three states differed sharply with
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, who told a
congressional panel Friday that stronger federal rules are the only
way to ensure the United States is compensated for spills by
foreign tankers.
   ``To argue that state laws offer a viable alternative to
(international treaties) is to ignore the facts,'' Skinner told the
Senate Environment and Public Works environmental protection
subcommittee.
   The administration wants to strengthen federal law and ratify
two international treaties involving payment for damages resulting
from oil spills caused by foreign tankers.
   But the local officials say those closest to tanker traffic and
accidents know best how to deal with the consequences.
   ``Pre-empting our state law and requiring us to ... rely on a
system administered by the federal government is not a proposal
which can be accepted by the state of Maine,'' Maine Attorney
General James E. Tierney said.
   ``Even if coupled with an international fund, the result (of the
treaties) would be that in some situations, damages would go
uncompensated because state law protection is unavailable,''said
Alaska Attorney General Douglas B. Baily.
   Tierney and Bailey were joined by Washington state Attorney
General Kenneth O. Eikenberry.
   Attempts to tighten regulations on fuel tankers have picked up
speed since the Exxon tanker Valdez ran aground March 24 in
Alaska's Prince William Sound, spilling nearly 11 million gallons
of Alaska crude into the water.
   Kenneth R. Dickerson, an Arco Oil Co. senior vice president,
told the panel his company supports giving the federal government
sole responsibility for oil-spill cleanups.

   The Bush administration, facing pressure from
lawmakers opposed to the costly B-2 bomber, is raising the stakes
by arguing that halting the program would be ``devastating to arms
control efforts.''
   In meetings at the White House and on Capitol Hill Friday,
officials told congressmen that the failure to fund the stealth
bomber would force the United States to withdraw its proposal in
strategic arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union.
   The coordinated effort for the radar-evading aircraft was in
evidence all over the Capitol. The pilots who guided the B-2 on its
first flight Monday _ Air Force Col. Rich Couch and Northrop Corp.
test pilot Bruce Hinds _ appeared before a Senate Armed Services
subcommittee and later met with members of Congress.
   Elsewhere, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Adm. William Crowe,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with lawmakers to plead
their case for the bomber.
   President Bush told House Republicans at a White House lobbying
session that stopping the $70 billion program would be
``devastating to arms control efforts,'' according to one
congressman in attendance, Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama.
   But some members remained unswayed.
   ``I was not convinced by the president's remarks,'' Rep. John
Rowland, R-Conn., said. ``There are a small number of Republicans
and hopefully a large number of Democrats'' who believe testing
should be completed before a commitment is made to build the 132
planes the Pentagon wants.
   ``By 1993 we will have purchased 44 planes'' at a cost of $40
billion, Rowland said. He said it is best to build a few, ``fly
them around ... develop them and then make a determination.''
   Rowland; Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio; and Rep. Ronald Dellums,
D-Calif., plan to introduce an amendment next week to the defense
bill to build only 13 bombers.
   Rowland said Bush rejected the offer.
   The White House has also rejected a proposal by Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, to pay for
just two bombers in 1990 and 1991 and not the eight sought by the
Pentagon. Aspin argues Congress needs more information on the plane
before deciding whether to kill it or spend more money.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., indicated his support
for the Aspin plan Friday.
   ``I think if I were voting I would probably be inclined to
support (it),'' he told reporters. ``I think we should not stop
this program, but we should have an opportunity to review it in the
near future.''
   The Pentagon has invested about $23 billion in the program and
hopes to purchase 132 bombers at a cost of about $70 billion.
   But lawmakers have suffered ``sticker shock'' from the price tag
_ $530 million for a single plane.
   For fiscal 1990, the Defense Department proposed spending $4.7
billion for the B-2, but the House Armed Services Committee last
month cut that by $800 million.
   Separately, a congressional source who requested anonymity said
Friday that a House Appropriations subcommittee voted Thursday to
strike $500 million in B-2 funds from the authorization bill.
   The argument that failure to build the B-2 would undermine the
START negotiations, which are aimed at reducing U.S. and Soviet
strategic or long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines by
30 to 50 percent, raised the ire of at least one Senate Armed
Services Committee member.
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., called it ``almost legislative
blackmail.''

   Investigators narrowed their focus
Friday to the tail of the ill-fated United Airlines DC-10 and a
blown rear engine that may have spewed pieces of metal like
shrapnel, wrecking the jet's steering system.
   Investigators also told of a heroic effort by an off-duty pilot
to help gain control of the airplane.
   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Jim Burnett said
an off-duty United pilot was on the plane and offered his
assistance to flight attendants shortly after the rear engine blew.
   The pilot was allowed into the cockpit to help the co-pilot
wrest control of the crippled plane.
   ``The only control mechanism that the crew had was to use engine
thrust,'' Burnett said. The off-duty pilot ``was on his knees
manipulating the throttle.
   ``What you have here is a situation of two men desperately
trying to get whatever control they can out of the aircraft,'' he
said.
   Rescue officials said Friday they had recovered 109 bodies and
planned to lift a large section of the fuselage with a crane to see
if there were two more bodies underneath. More than 180 people
survived the crash.
   It was not known whether the off-duty pilot, whose name was not
released, survived the crash, but United reported shortly after the
crash Wednesday that everyone in the cockpit had survived.
   United, however, still had not released definite figures on the
number of victims and survivors nearly 2{ days after the crash.
Burnett said 111 people were killed, and United said 109 people
died.
   Burnett said NTSB figures showed 297 were on board, two more
than earlier reports, and that there were 186 survivors. United
said there were 296 on board with 187 survivors.
   ``I don't know what the NTSB is using for their count,'' said
Sue Moss, United spokeswoman. ``We feel ours is correct.''
   Of the injured, 47 remained at two hospitals Friday in
conditions ranging from very critical to good.
   State Medical Examiner Tom Bennett said an autopsy would be
performed on all bodies recovered, to determine the cause of death
and to ease family concerns.
   ``I'd rather have the evidence and the answers right now for the
family members. Three to six months down the road, they're going to
be tormented by this. They are going to come back to us with
questions,'' he said.
   Bennett said 12 autopsies had been completed, with pathologists,
crime investigators, FBI fingerprint experts and dentists working
in a makeshift morgue set up in a hangar at the Air National Guard
base adjacent to the airport.
   Meanwhile, investigators from the National Transportation Safety
Board began measuring the tail section from the shattered plane in
the search for clues to the crash.
   ``The fan on the engine in the tail is not with the rest of the
wreckage,'' said Burnett. ``We hope to be able to find that, and
we're going to be looking at an additional wreckage area about 60
miles away from the principal site.''
   Field workers near Alta, about 55 miles east of Sioux City,
reported a large section of the jumbo jet in a test field
Wednesday, shortly before the jet crashed, turned a cartwheel and
exploded in flames during an emergency landing at Sioux Gateway
Airport. Flight 232 had been bound for Chicago and Philadelphia
from Denver.
   Burnett said that early examination of the hydraulic lines led
investigators to conclude that at least two were severed.
   ``They were cut cleanly. It's very clean,'' he said.
   Burnett said the third hydraulic line was badly damaged from
contact with the ground.
   Burnett also said preliminary findings showed that the small
wing of the tail had several holes and the hydraulic system had
lost all fluid. The hydraulic system is routed through the tail and
allows the pilot to manipulate wing and tail controls.
   Investigators were surprised to discover the entire fan-rotor
system missing from the rear engine, the first time he has seen
that, Burnett said. The DC-10 has three engines, one on each wing
and on the tail.
   Burnett acknowledged Friday that it was conceivable that pieces
of metal spewing from a disintegrating rear engine could have
caused the small holes on on the tail wing and could have severed
the hydraulic lines in the tail section. But he cautioned against
jumping to conclusions about the cause of the accident, a warning
echoed by aviation expert Pat Murphy.
   ``If you start with an engine throwing off the blades (of the
fan), called an uncontained failure, it's a plausible chain of
events to get at how the steering may have been knocked out,''
Murphy, vice president of operations for Avtias Inc., a Reston,
Va.-based aircraft consulting firm, said in a telephone interview.
   ``But what is being speculated may not have happened. And from
the standpoint of the industry, what is potentially much more
important is why the engine developed uncontained failure,'' he
said. ``The CF6 (engine) is not historically a blade-throwing
engine.''
   The manufacturer, General Electric Co., said its GE Aircraft
Engines division sent a five-member team to help investigate.
   The chief flight attendant told the NTSB an explosion rocked the
jet over western Iowa, knocking flight attendants to the floor,
Burnett said at a news conference late Thursday. The attendant, who
was unidentified, went into the cockpit and found the flight crew
struggling to regain control of the plane, he said.
   Thirty-four minutes before trying the emergency landing, the
pilot told air traffic controllers he had almost no control of the
aircraft, Burnett said.
   Investigators also were reviewing maintenance records on the
15-year-old jet. Burnett said repair work involving the rear engine
was done on the plane the day before the crash, to correct a
problem with the pneumatic system.
   The pneumatic system uses excess pressure generated by the giant
engine to power the aircraft's air-conditioning system. Burnett
said there was no way that problem ``would have, could have''
affected the engine itself.
   Iowa air and army national guardsmen and investigators from the
FBI and the state Department of Criminal Investigation continued to
look for wreckage around the runway.
   Their efforts focused on a large, blackened section of the
fuselage lying in a cornfield alongside the scorched runway where
United pilot Capt. Al C. Haynes brought the crippled jumbo jet down.
   The National Guard and medical examiners had asked families for
dental and medical records and other information that would help
identify the victims, said Sinda.
   Bennett said two-thirds of the victims apparently were killed by
the impact of the crash, and the remaining third in the fire it
touched off. Visual identification is often impossible for burn
victims, Bennett said. The victims also included children, who
frequently haven't had dental X-rays taken, he said.
   The Rev. Lawrence Soens, bishop of the Roman Catholic diocese of
Sioux City, said a special Mass for about 400 people at noon.
   ``There are moments of great tragedy when our very nature calls
out to God,'' Soens said during his homily. ``This is such a
moment.''

<HEAD>Former Aide to Roth, Rinaldo Charged With Bank Robbery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, MD. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former press aide to two members of
Congress is facing charges he robbed two suburban Washington, D.C.,
banks.
   Thomas Springer, 40, was charged Thursday with three counts of
armed robbery, including two robberies at one branch of the
Maryland National Bank in Bethesda, Md., Montgomery County police
said Friday.
   Springer was arrested Thursday morning in a wooded area near
that bank shortly after what police said was the second robbery.
   Police spokesman Sgt. Harry Geehreng said a man carrying a box
entered the bank about 10:30 a.m. and handed a teller a note saying
he had a bomb and wanted money. The man fled through a back door
with an undisclosed amount of cash.
   Springer was arrested shortly afterward, police said.
   Springer, of Silver Spring, Md., was also was charged with
robbing the same branch on April 14 and a Crestar Bank branch in
Bethesda on May 12, police said.
   He was held in the Montgomery County jail in lieu of $50,000
bond.
   Springer was a longtime press secretary to Rep. Toby Roth,
R-Wis., the congressman said Friday.
   Springer left his press job in 1987, but was later given a
temporary assignment in the office, a Roth aide said.
   Roth said he gave Springer the temporary job ``because I felt
sorry for him,'' but that Springer then failed to show up for work.
   ``I am deeply saddened,'' Roth said, adding that Springer's
``behavior had deteriorated'' in recent years.
   Springer also worked for Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J., on a
temporary basis, according to a statement from Rinaldo. ``Tom
Springer worked here for a very short time and while he was here
his work was satisfactory,'' the statement said.

   Former President Carter will travel to
Ethiopia next week to serve as a mediator between the government
and Eritrean rebels in an effort to resolve their long-running
conflict, a U.S. diplomat says.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen on Friday said Carter
had been accepted by both the Marxist government of Haile Mengistu
Mariam and by the Eritrean rebels who have been warring against the
government for 28 years in one of Africa's longest-running civil
wars.
   Cohen told reporters a dialogue between the two sides would make
it easier for the United States to improve relations with
Mengistu's government, which have been strained since the early
1980s when Mengistu shifted his country's alliances to the Soviet
Union.
   The Soviets have been pressing Mengistu to negotiate with the
rebels and end the costly war in an effort to cut Soviet aid to
Ethiopia.
   Carter visited Ethiopia earlier this year and met with Mengistu.
In recent years, the former president has been a mediator and
observer in foreign conflicts.

<NOTE>Bunker Hunt Blames Banks For Partnership At Heart of Tax Dispute</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas oilman Nelson Bunker Hunt is blaming his
bank creditors for forcing on him and his brothers a partnership to
handle the repayment of his enormous silver debts.
   The deal is at the heart of a $300 million dispute with the
Internal Revenue Service, which contends the partnership was a sham.
   Hunt said Friday the banks ``pretty much took over for a while
and dictated'' his affairs after Silver Thursday, the day in late
March 1980 when silver prices tumbled from a high of $50 an ounce
to $10 an ounce.
   ``The net effect was we didn't have control over our business.
That's why I'm sitting here in court, because the structure the
banks put us in,'' Hunt told U.S. Tax Court Judge Jules G. Korner
III.
   Hunt is contesting $155 million in 1982 taxes the IRS claims are
due from the dissolution of the partnership he and his brothers set
up after Silver Thursday to repay as much as $2 billion on their
soured silver investments.
   Brother William Herbert Hunt is contesting more than $158
million in 1982 taxes, while Lamar, owner of the Kansas City Chiefs
football team, is contesting $505,377.

<NOTE>House Easily OKs Bill, Sends It To The Senate</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has approved a $14.3 billion foreign
aid bill that sends a warning to the Philippines to improve its
management of aid dollars and begins President Bush's initiatives
in Hungary and Poland to boost private development.
   The lawmakers voted 329 to 69 Friday to approve what
traditionally has been one of the most contentious pieces of
legislation Congress takes up each year. The bill, one of 13 basic
money measures that fund the full array of federal programs, goes
to the Senate next.
   The measure includes $160 million as the U.S. contribution
toward the Multilateral Assistance Initiative for the Philippines,
an effort to bolster the government of President Corazon Aquino
with an influx of development aid.
   But that amount falls below the $200 million pledged to the
program by President Bush. The cut was intended to signal concerns
that money already flowing to the Philippines is not being used or
is being wasted.
   The measure includes $10 million for Poland and $5 million for
Hungary to begin a three-year, $125-million plan announced by Bush
last week to encourage private development in those two East Bloc
countries.

<NOTE>Four Officials Told They'll Be Dismissed</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Department of Housing and Urban
Development officials are being fired as part of the department's
investigation of mismanagement and cronyism during the Reagan
administration.
   Three were told Friday that they will be dismissed in 30 days
unless they can refute charges of mismanagement against them, and a
fourth, who is out of town, will be told next Tuesday, HUD
officials disclosed.
   The members of the department's troubled Washington field office
are the first people dismissed in connection with the probe.
   The Washington field office was the base of operations of escrow
agent Marilyn Harrell, who became known as ``Robin HUD'' after she
confessed to diverting $5.5 million of the department's money to
charities.
   The four officials were placed on leave in June, then given
temporary assignments at headquarters when their leaves expired
earlier this month.
   They are Margaret White, former head of the office; Robert B.
Warner, director of housing management; Charles W. Womble, loan
specialist; and Everett Rothschild, head of property disposition.
   An audit of the office found that lax financial and management
controls allowed agents like Ms. Harrell to delay transfers of
funds or not make them at all. Auditors have estimated the office
is missing a total of $10 million.
   Rothschild will be given his letter on Tuesday, the officials
said.

<HEAD>Three Held on Charges of Exporting Computer to Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men have been arrested for trying to ship a
computer with possible military applications to the Soviet Union in
what officials said was a major enterprise to violate U.S.
technology transfer laws.
   Two of the men, Shiv Mohan, 40, of India, and John Townsend, 43,
a Briton residing in Australia, were charged Friday with attempting
to export a Digital Equipment Corp. VAX 8700 ``super
minicomputer,'' that could be used in the design of nuclear
weapons, submarines and missile and radar tracking systems, said
U.S. Attorney Gene Wilson.
   Along with a third man, David Whyte, 35, of Canada, they also
were charged with conspiring to illegally export computer goods and
other commodities.
   About a dozen federal agents on Friday raided a meeting in
Buffalo, N.Y., the three were holding with Robert J. Casperson, a
Seattle-area businessman who was acting as a government informant.
Investigators seized more than $850,000 they believe was used to
finance the exports, Wilson said.
   The three men were in custody and court hearings were scheduled
Monday. Wilson said the three probably would be returned within two
weeks to Seattle, where the criminal complaint was lodged.
   Allen J. Adrezin, chief export enforcement officer for the
Commerce Department in New York, said Mohan, Whyte and Townsend
were believed to be ``major players'' in illegal transfer of
computer technology to the Soviet Union.
   Mohan is managing director of Koninoor Impex Private Ltd in New
Delhi, a trading house that exports computers and software to the
Soviet Union, according to an complaint filed by Jerry Mark Hobbs,
a Commerce Department special agent.
   The Commerce Department complaint said Mohan and Townsend, head
of Computer Acquisition Private Ltd in Newcastle, Australia, paid
Casperson and Whyte to act as brokers for computer equipment that
they planned to ship through Canada. Whyte is sales manager of
Compu-Tech Inc., a Canadian company with a Buffalo office that
officials said was established to get the equipment from the United
States to Canada.
   Mohan and Townsend bought a VAX 8700 valued at $547,000, took it
apart and shipped it in 11 containers to a non-existent company in
Singapore for reshipment to Mohan's customers in the Soviet bloc,
according to the complaint.
   Tipped by employees from two freight forwarding companies,
department officials notified the U.S. Customs Service, which
intercepted the computer in Singapore, Wilson said.
   After a March 29 search of his suburban Seattle firm, C-Tek
Computers, Casperson agreed to cooperate in the investigation by
allowing his telephone conversations with Townsend and Whyte to be
monitored, the complaint said.
   In January, Mohan and Townsend allegedly placed orders for 50
Tektronix 4225 computer work stations valued at $900,000 that were
to be shipped, illegally, to Mohan's company in India.

   The majorettes twirled plungers. Others
banged on bedpans and blasted on kazoos as 150 residents of this
college town marched and stumbled down Main Street to celebrate the
final stage of a sewer project.
   The tongue-in-cheek celebration called SewerFest gave residents
a chance Friday to vent their frustration at sewer construction
that has thrown car alignments out of whack and forced motorists
into long, convoluted routes.
   ``Didn't you love the noises? It was wonderful,'' beamed Marion
B. Kelly, one of hundreds who lined the main street of this
picturesque town of 8,860, about 30 miles southwest of Cleveland.
   Parade marchers embodied the necessary and the unlovely. Some
dressed as sewer rats; others wore construction overalls and draped
drain-cleaning equipment around their necks. Many marchers wore
plungers on their heads.
   Among the floats were a sewer cleaning cart marked ``Sewer
Busters'' and a wooden outhouse _ door flapping open and shut _
carted on a trailer. A caravan of a dozen dump trucks blasted their
horns.
   The Oberlin Downtown Merchants Association, sponsor of
SewerFest, set a theme of ``Alternative Transportation Methods for
Oberlin Streets'' and invited folks to climb onto bicycles and
skateboards before joining the parade.
   Since last fall, city crews have ripped up streets and set up
barricades to upgrade an aging sewer system overtaxed by storm
water runoff.
   ``It's kind of getting there,'' said Karen Smith, assistant
public works director for the city, which is the home of Oberlin
College. ``We've got a target completion of Aug. 31 for the bulk of
the sewer work on the streets.''
   She said one problem was two main streets were under
construction at the same time.
   ``I've had the advantage of knowing what's going on day to day,
although I've forgotten a few detours from time to time. People who
usually can just run down the street to the grocery store now have
to go two miles around,'' she said.
   Yvonne Hazlett, who braved the road hurdles from nearby Elyria
so that she could march in the parade, also lamented the situation.
   ``Oh, it's terrible. You can't go east, you can't go west. The
streets are all banged up,'' she said as she leaned on her plunger.
   She wore a rubber rat taped to her shirt.
   Some participated in SewerFest in a more sedate manner, by
entering the essay contest.
   Entrants wrote about their worst experiences poking past the
city's broken streets and trenches in hopes of winning a suitable
prize: a front-end alignment for their car.

   The crew of the ill-fated United Airlines jet
desperately sought the advice of the airline's experts in San
Francisco when officials on the ground in Iowa couldn't help them,
a newspaper reported.
   ``If you have any suggestions, holler,'' one of the three crew
members radioed to workers at United's maintenance headquarters on
Wednesday.
   But the crisis aboard the DC-10 bound for Chicago from Denver
was so unusual that it took the experts 10 minutes to understand
the severity of the problem and they still offered no solutions,
The New York Times reported Saturday.
   Meanwhile, ABC News reported Friday that the navigational system
at the Sioux City, Iowa, airport where the pilot was trying to land
the plane had been turned off.
   Glenn Bush, a Federal Aviation Administration manager in Des
Moines, said the building housing the navigational aid system known
as VOR, or Very high frequency OmniRange, was scheduled to be shut
down at noon on Wednesday _ about four hours before the crash _ for
maintenance.
   A VOR gives pilots the bearing of the airport and pilots use the
information to check whether they are on course.
   Bush said all pilots were notified of the shutdown weeks before.
   However, he said ``it did not even contribute to anything to the
aircraft as far as getting it back to the airport.''
   United Flight 232 was unable to fly in such a pattern because
its hydraulic lines had been severly damaged and the pilot, Capt.
Al C. Haynes, had almost no control of the aircraft.
   Forty-one minutes after an explosion at the rear of the plane,
the jet crashed as it tried to land, killing at least 109 people.
Federal officials say at least 184 people survived.
   The pilots' controls had stopped working so an off-duty United
pilot who had been sitting with the crew went to the rear of the
plane after the explosion and saw a foot-wide hole in the
horizontal part of the tail, the newspaper said.
   In their 25-minute conversation with the experts, the crew of
Flight 232 reported that they could not turn left, only right.
   The crew reported that the jet had lost hydraulic control _ no
elevators, ailerons or flaps _ and the throttle for the damaged
rear engine could not be moved.
   The experts in San Francisco seemed doubtful and asked again and
again ``What have you lost?''
   Someone listening to the transmissions between the crew and the
experts interjected: ``How many times do they have to tell them''
that they've lost all hydraulics, the paper reported.
   A federal official close to the investigation told the Times
that the pilot once became impatient with the repeated questions
about the hydraulic problem and said: ``I'm telling the truth.''
   The crew flew the jet, carrying 293 passengers and crew members,
guiding the plane by increasing and decreasing power to the two
remaining, wing-mounted engines, the Times reported.
   As the DC-10 approached the Sioux City, Iowa, airport, the San
Francisco experts kept quiet so as to not disturb the crew's
concentration.
   These and other details were disclosed to the Times by an
airline employee familiar with the conversation.

   A hooded gunman burst into a Bible study
class at a church Friday night, opening fire and killing two women
and wounding a man inside a chapel crowded with adults and
children, police said.
   The gunman ran into the Mount Olive Church of God in Christ and
opened fire as about 45 adults and children attended class at the
church that had a reputation for its anti-drug activism, said Sgt.
Frank Mena.
   One man, who was shot in the leg, was taken to California
Medical Center, Mena said. Identities of the dead were not
immediately known.
   ``We heard ... that this church is very anti-gang, anti-drug,''
Mena said. But he added it was unclear if the killings were
gang-related.
   No arrests were made and a search for the gunman was under way,
police said. The class participants remained inside the church more
than an hour after the 9:30 p.m. shooting.
   One woman whose whose children were inside the church at the
time of the attack said she was told the assailant wore black
clothing.
   ``The lady who drives the church bus called me,'' said Freddie
Willis whose twin 8-year-old daughters were inside the church
during the attack but were unharmed.
   ``She just told me someone dressed in black just came in and
shot up the church,'' she said.
   City fire spokesman Jim Wells said three ambulances were sent to
the scene of the shooting, an area of the city plagued by gang
activity.

<TEXT>
   Indians from the coasts of western
Washington and British Columbia crossed Puget Sound in a flotilla
of some two dozen traditional canoes on the last leg of the
``Paddle to Seattle.''
   Participants _ paddlers, chiefs and canoe-builders _ said Friday
they hoped the trip in hand-carved cedar vessels also was a
celebration of a reawakening of Indian customs and traditions.
   ``It's a taste of our ancestors,'' said Chuck Harrison, a
Quileute Indian who had made the 179-mile trip from LaPush, on the
Washington coast. ``It makes us proud to be Indians _ Hoh and
Quileutes.''
   The Quileutes and Hohs, from the mouth of the Hoh River, paddled
together on the journey, which is part of the state's centennial
celebrations. The Quileutes retraced a route used for trade early
this century, and invited other tribes to join them in what became
known as the ``Paddle to Seattle.''
   Many other tribes took up the invitation, and the flotilla on
the seven-mile trip Friday from Suquamish to Golden Gardens in
north Seattle represented canoes from as near as Suquamish and as
far away as Bella Bella, on the British Columbia coast 100 miles
north of Vancouver Island.
   Some ocean-going canoes carried as many as 18 people. The
smallest dugout carried a single paddler.
   The arrival of the canoes in Seattle on Friday signaled the
beginning of a weekend of canoe racing, dancing and eating at
salmon bakes.
   The meeting of the tribes was a special time, said Jerry Jones,
designer of the Tulalip tribe's canoe.
   ``We hope that this will be a start to bring back our culture
and heritage,'' he said. ``I hope that 150 years from now our
descendants will still be paddling canoes and not forget they are
Indian.''
   He said the last large canoe carved by the Tulalips was turned
out 70 years ago, and he had to learn the skills of canoe-building
as he went. Jones said he hoped to pass traditions down to others
of his tribe in a book on building canoes.
   Others at the gathering said using the canoes was a new
experience, nearly lost in the age of their grandparents.
   ``It's a neat experience I never had,'' said Roger Sullivan, a
Port Klallam Indian. ``It's a tradition that will come back, I
hope.''
   The Indians coming the farthest _ nearly 400 miles _ were
members of the Heiltsuk Nation near Bella Bella. Frank Brown, of
the Heiltsuk, said his tribe had issued a challenge to other
Northwest tribes to meet at Bella Bella four years from now ``and
talk about where we want to go as a people.''
   At least some accepted the challenge.
   ``We gave them a Quileute paddle, that we have to get back'' by
going to Bella Bella, said Henry Lee Morganroth, a Quileute paddler.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Death Sentence For Confessed Communist Agent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Seoul appellate court today upheld
the death sentence for a confessed North Korean agent who bombed a
South Korean airliner in 1987, killing 115 people.
   Kim Hyon Hui, 27, looked downward and showed little emotion as
Judge Lee Young Il found her guilty of violating national security,
criminal and aviation laws and sentenced her to death by hanging.
   Government officials have privately indicated that Kim will be
pardoned even if the verdict is upheld through the Supreme Court.
   Several relatives of victims of the bombing wept and shouted
insults when Kim, clad in a white jacket and pants, was escorted by
two female security guards into the packed courtroom. An elderly
relative collapsed.
   ``Bring back my son. Why did you kill my innocent son?'' one
relative shouted.
   The judge described the bombing as ``atrocious and unethical''
and said Kim deserved severe punishment for killing innocent people.
   The defense had argued that Kim should be given a lighter
sentence because she was duped by North Korean leaders. Defense
attorney Ahn Dong Il said he and his client would decide within a
week whether to appeal to the Supreme Court.
   Kim admitted in several hearings to bombing the Korean Air
Boeing 707 that disappeared near Burma on Nov. 29, 1987, on its way
from Baghdad, Iraq, to Seoul with 115 people on board.
   She told the court that she had planted two bombs, one disguised
as a radio and one as a liquor bottle, on orders from Kim Jong Il,
son and heir to North Korean President Kim Il Sung, to disrupt the
1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.
   North Korea denied involvement and accused the south of staging
the bombing to embarrass the north. The two Koreas have been bitter
rivals since their land was divided in 1945, and they fought the
three-year Korean War in 1950-53.

   The recent Supreme Court ruling on abortion
has boosted membership in the National Organization for Women and
the group said it will push for legislation to prevent states from
restricting abortions.
   NOW President Molly Yard outlined the organization's plans at a
Friday news conference opening its annual conference.
   Ms. Yard said a surge of activism sparked by the high court's
July 3 decision has created interest in NOW in recent weeks.
Membership has grown from about 160,000 last year to 200,000, she
said.
   The court granted states some powers to restrict access to
abortions.
   ``People are angry,'' Ms. Yard said. ``They are angry that
someone would come into their lives, into so personal a decision as
when, and if, to have children.''
   Outside the conference at the Cincinnati Convention Center, a
dozen abortion opponents picketed.
   NOW lawyers are working on a proposal, which could take the form
of a bill or constitutional amendment, to prohibit states from
interfering with women's rights to have abortions, Ms. Yard said.
The organization hopes to have the proposal introduced in Congress
in September.
   Ms. Yard said NOW, using an approach that abortion opponents
have used in the past, would campaign to defeat lawmakers who
oppose women's right to abortion.
   ``Have you watched politicians running for cover ever since July
3?'' she said. ``We intend, on the national and state level, to
fight those who would deny women the freedom to control their
reproductive lives and who would deny us equal rights under the
Constitution. ... That is the message of the women's movement.''
   Ms. Yard said NOW will work against President Bush because the
group regards him as being an opponent of women's rights.

   Shellfire hit a Khmer Rouge refugee
camp on the Thai-Cambodian border for a second day today, killing
up to four people and forcing thousands to flee, a U.N. relief
official said.
   The shelling came in two separate morning attacks, said Patrick
Van de Velde, deputy director of the U.N. Border Relief Operation.
He cited unconfirmed reports as saying seven people were wounded
and four killed.
   Other Western officials said pro-Vietnamese forces apparently
staged the attacks as well as shelling Friday that killed one
refugee and wounded 10 others.
   The shelling, the heaviest ever on Site 8, could be intended to
gain bargaining power at the peace talks to open in Paris on
Monday, the officials said.
   Site 8, home to about 40,000 Cambodians, is about 156 miles east
of Bangkok, separated from Cambodia by sheer rocky cliffs.
   Populated mostly by women and children, it is the main civilian
camp run by the communist Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla group
fighting the Vietnamese-supported army in Cambodia.
   In the past, the Khmer Rouge has shelled its own camps as part
of its attempts to exercise strict control over the refugees.
Widespread human rights violations have been reported.
   Van de Velde said the refugees first sought shelter from the
shelling at the base of the cliffs or along a road leading to Site
8. Later, they all gathered in an open area about a mile further
inside Thailand, he said.
   ``We are sending emergency supplies to help them build temporary
shelters,'' Van de Velde said.
   On Friday, a 22-year-old man was killed and 10 other refugees
wounded, including two small children, when 27 or 28 shells crashed
into the camp, a Red Cross official said.
   Fighting between pro-Vietnamese forces and the Khmer Rouge has
increased along the border in recent days, as is often the case
before diplomatic events and peace talks.
   The Khmer Rouge and the other guerrilla groups are to hold talks
with the Vietnam-installed government in Paris next week, and
attend an international conference on Cambodia starting July 30.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and toppled the Khmer Rouge
government, which had killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians in
execution chambers and slave labor camps after coming to power in
1975.

<HEAD>Eight Peace Activists Arrested as Marines Make Mock Invasion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The mock invasion of this city on the banks
of Lake Superior looked real enough, with 100 camouflaged Marines,
armed with M-16 rifles, splashing ashore in amphibious tanks.
   But 100 peace activists thought something was missing from
Friday's maneuvers: the horror.
   ``The Marines don't show the trauma, the confusion, the effects
of war,'' said Charles Wolden of Superior, Wis., who served four
years as a Marine in Vietnam and 12 years in the U.S. Air Force
before retiring from the military.
   So when the Marines hit the beach at noon and began shooting
blanks at more than 1,000 spectators, the peace activists held up a
representation of the Grim Reaper and feigned death, while others
moaned and comforted the ``wounded.''
   Paul Broman, who spent the day toting signs such as ``Peace
through strength,'' said he supported the drill, part of an annual,
21-city Great Lakes recruiting and training voyage of the USS
Boulder.
   ``I think it's great,'' Broman said. ``I hope it persuades more
people to join the Marines so we have a safe nation.''
   When the Marines' amphibious crafts were just yards from
landing, several protesters broke through a 4-foot-high rubber mesh
fence. Seven were arrested, including an elderly man who tried to
dodge police but was tackled in Lake Superior. An eighth person was
arrested before the maneuver.
   No injuries were reported.
   One of the eight was charged with felony disorderly conduct and
assault, a felony; the others were cited on various misdemeanors.
   The peace activists used a loudspeaker during the maneuver to
protest U.S. military actions since World War II, but they
occasionally were drowned out by chanting Marine supporters.

<HEAD>Brazil Gets Money to Pave Road in Amazon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A development bank has agreed to loan
Brazil money to begin paving a highway in the western Amazon,
ending a two-year delay caused by environmentalists worried about
the road's effect on the fragile forest.
   William Ellis, the Inter-American Development Bank's
representative in Brazil, said Friday the bank would finance 40
percent of the $146 million needed to complete the jungle project.
   Brazil will receive 80 percent of the money immediately, and the
remainder will be released after the government complies with a
promise to create Indian and forest reserves and control forest
burning in the region, Ellis said.
   At a presidential palace ceremony Thursday, Planning Minister
Joao Batista de Abreu hailed the highway as a ``salvation'' for the
remote Amazon state of Acre, which borders Peru and Bolivia about
2,657 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Work on the highway was suspended in October 1987. When
completed, the 312-mile route would link Rio Branco, the capital of
Acre, and Porto Velho, the capital Rondonia.
   The bank, which financed the paving of 186 miles of dirt road
between the two capitals, cut off the money under pressure from
international environmental groups and the U.S. government because
of widespread cutting and burning of the tropical rainforest.
   It later demanded the government take measures to protect the
rainforest and the estimated 16,000 Indians that live in the region.
   The states of Acre and Rondonia have been devastated at an
increasing rate by landless peasants, miners and ranchers who slash
and burn the tropical rainforest and settle there.
   Environmentalists warn an asphalt roadway would spur an influx
of settlers, and lead to greater ecological destruction and
disruption of Indian communities.
   But state authorities in Acre _ the nations' poorest and most
underdeveloped state _ see the highway as the only way to break the
state's isolation from the rest of the country.

   Supporters of suspended Navajo
Chairman Peter MacDonald are calling for new protests after a rally
resulted in a violent clash with tribal police that left two dead.
   Police said they opened fire in self-defense after being
attacked Thursday by a crowd that numbered more than 300. Some
protesters said the officers fired needlessly.
   Interim Chairman Leonard Haskie said Friday that MacDonald
incited his supporters and was indirectly responsible for the
fracas, which tribal police and the FBI were investigating.
   Nine people, including three police officers, were injured.
   ``It is unfortunate that Chairman MacDonald has resorted to
tactics contrary to the customs of the Navajo people,'' Haskie told
a news conference. ``He has been the architect of the entire
episode.''
   Witnesses said the demonstration got out of hand when the crowd
attacked Navajo police Lt. Daniel Hawkins, who led a May 24 sweep
of the tribe's administration building during which MacDonald
appointees and supporters were evicted from offices they had
refused to leave.
   After the shootings, about 100 MacDonald supporters broke into
the tribe's government complex, ransacked it and occupied it for
about five hours before leaving, witnesses said.
   ``I don't feel responsible for the killing because these are
people who have their own personal feelings,'' MacDonald told
reporters Friday. His whereabouts during the clash were unknown.
   Lloyd Begay, an organizer of the faction that supports
MacDonald, said the leadership of the group had debated another
protest and decided to wait until after the funerals of James
Dickson, 57, and Arnold Lee Begay, 27, no relation to Lloyd Begay.
   ``People want to demonstrate now, but we're advising them not to
at this time. This is a time for mourning,'' Begay told The Mesa
Tribune.
   No funeral dates have been set.
   MacDonald was placed on administrative leave by the governing
council of the nation's largest Indian tribe after allegations at
U.S. Senate hearings in January that he accepted bribes and
kickbacks. He has denied any wrongdoing, and followers believe he
was deposed illegally, although tribal courts have upheld the move.
   ``Peter MacDonald has shown himself to be the most prominent and
most irresponsible Navajo leader,'' said Rep. Morris Udall,
D-Ariz., chairman of the House Interior Committee.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said in Washington, D.C.,
that MacDonald should leave the reservation for the good of his
people.
   MacDonald said at a news conference that the Tribal Council had
created a leadership vacuum when it placed him on administrative
leave Feb. 13 and that the Bureau of Indian Affairs had acted
irresponsibly in removing Wilbur Kellogg, who was police chief
under MacDonald.
   ``As the duly elected leader, I call for an immediate
investigation,'' MacDonald said.
   There were no physical signs of unrest Friday, although about 50
people were camped just across the New Mexico line. Large stones
and shards of glass littered the road running through the tribal
government complex.
   Three of the injured remained hospitalized Friday in good or
satisfactory condition.

   Syrian and Christian forces pounded each
other's sectors with heavy shelling during the night, killing six
people and wounding more than 50 in one of the most ferocious
battles of the current conflict, police said.
   The blasts of exploding rockets and shells shook Beirut's Moslem
and Christian sectors and local radio stations interrupted regular
programming to urge civilians to rush to underground shelters.
   Police said 52 people were wounded and at least six killed in
the nine-hour battle with howitzers, rockets and tank cannons in
Beirut and the surrounding mountains.
   The 18-week confrontation between Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly
Christian troops and Syrian forces has claimed 440 lives and
wounded 1,836 people, by police count.
   Police said the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces militia,
Aoun's ally in the confrontation with the Syrians, fired its 122mm
rocket launchers against residential districts in Moslem west
Beirut.
   ``Thousands of rockets and shells rained on Beirut last night,''
said a police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations.
   Exploding rockets ripped into hundreds of apartments, shops and
office buildings and fires blazed out of control due to lack of
water for fire engines.
   Telephone lines were out because of a total power outage in the
shattered Lebanese capital.
   ``Several casualties remained under the rubble for quite a long
time, simply because no one had a telephone line to request help
from rescuers,'' the police spokesman said.
   The civil defense directorate sent teams to tour the
debris-covered streets of west Beirut during short lulls,
announcing their presence through loudspeakers.
   ``A civil defense team is in the area. Please notify us of your
need for help,'' rescuers shouted as their ambulance drove slowly
through the Zaidaniyeh district.
   ``Over here. Over here,'' someone shouted back from the rubble
of a two-story house$
   Rockets fired from Christian east Beirut scored at least 10
direct hits on the plush, 12-story Taljeh apartment building in
west Beirut's Karakon district, inhabited by Druse Moslems,
damaging it heavily.
   ``This is not an army barracks, or an artillery emplacement.
This is a residential building. I wonder why did they do this to
us,'' said a man who identified as Abu Hassan.
   ``We were all in the underground basement, luckily,'' he said.
``All the tenants of this buildings lost their apartments,'' he
added.
   Two rockets also blasted the Samir Taxi company in west Beirut's
Zarif district, destroying the owner's four cars and a nearby
butcher's shop.
   ``I've managed to keep the company running despite 14 years of
civil war. Now I've lost the office and the cars,'' said the owner,
Abu Samir.
   The owner's oldest son was caught in the cross-fire of a clash
between rival gunmen near the taxi office and killed in the early
days of the civil war.
   ``The war took Samir and the company I named after him,'' the
white-haired Abu Samir said, his eyes brimming with tears.
   A spokesman for Aoun's command, speaking on condition he not be
named, said his gunners blasted Syrian artillery emplacements along
west Beirut's sea front and in wooded mountains south and east of
the capital.
   ``We did not direct our fire against civilians,'' said the
spokesman. He refused to elaborate.
   He accused the Syrians of provoking the barrage by shelling the
Christian-controlled coast north of Beirut Friday evening. ``We
responded to the Syrian barrage and they responded by shelling
(Christian) population centers.''
   Rockets fired by Syrian gunners started several fires in east
Beirut's Ashrafiyeh residential district and the summer resorts of
Brummana and Beit Meri, the police spokesman said.
   The overnight duel was one of the fiercest in the present round
of violence that broke out March 8. The police spokesman said
thousands of panicky civilians left Beirut during the early morning
lull heading to rural areas in the south, east and the north.
   The intensified shelling duels followed a statement by Aoun's
three-man Christian cabinet saying the only settlement to Lebanon's
crisis was ``the withdrawal of the Syrian army.''
   The Christian cabinet is vying for power with Salim Hoss' Moslem
cabinet in west Beirut.
   Aoun, 54, a Maronite Catholic, on March 8 declared a ``war of
liberation'' against Syria's 40,000 troops deployed in
predominantly Moslem sections under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate
from the 22-nation Arab League.
   The Syrians and allied Moslem Lebanese factions retaliated by
besieging the 310-square-mile Christian enclave where Aoun's troops
and the Lebanese Forces militia are entrenched.

   Assailants attacked a patrol that was
clearing roadblocks and confiscating weapons in western Georgia,
killing two police cadets in the latest bloodshed in the volatile
region, Tass said today.
   The official news agency said the attack took place Friday night
in the village of Ostapi in Abkhazia, the Black Sea resort area
where the native Abkhazians have been fighting ethnic Georgians
since July 15.
   Abkhazians are a minority in their homeland, a so-called
autonomous republic inside the republic of Georgia. Both ethnic
groups in the enclave each claim discrimination by the other.
   The patrol was clearing roadblocks set up by villagers and
confiscating weapons when it ``was fired on by unknown people using
hunting rifles,'' Tass said. Two students of a Leningrad Interior
Ministry academy, which trains police, were killed, raising the
death toll in the Abkhazian violence to 19.
   In another village, Lindava, police found a pit amid bushes
containing 374 pounds of explosives and 550 fuses with detonators,
Tass said. It said the situation in the region was not improving,
adding that public transport remained idle, many businesses
remained closed and railroad workers were still on strike.
   Radio Moscow warned that ``heaps of garbage in hot weather could
result in an epidemic.''
   Zarya Vostoka, a newspaper published in the Georgian capital
Tbilisi, said cargo trucks were getting through only when escorted
by police.
   The youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported that someone
had freed 174 prisoners from a jail in the city of Zugdidi. It did
not give the nationality of the prisoners.
   On Tuesday, authorities declared area around Sukhumi, the
Abkhazian capital, off-limits to the millions of tourists who
vacation there each year and imposed emergency regulations,
including an 11 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew. Police and soldiers have
seized more than 2,700 firearms since the emergency was declared.
   Police confiscated four anti-tank and two anti-personnel mines
at one village, Zarya Vostoka said.
   ``Vremya,'' the nightly television news program, said, ``In the
last 24 hours, groups of hooligans in western Georgia have seized
almost 1,400 hunting and combat weapons'' in more than 40 raids.
   Abkhazia, 800 miles south of Moscow, remained closed to Western
reporters.
   Special flights and ships continued evacuating the thousands of
tourists stranded in Sukhumi, the Red Army newspaper Krasnaya
Zvezda reported today.
   It said 4,300 people were evacuated on 46 special flights and
15,000 were taken from Sukhumi harbor by cruise ships.
   Zarya Vostoka said 31 policemen and internal security troopers
were among the injured. The radio said the trouble was caused by
Abkhazian demands for secession from Georgia.
   At least 132 people have died in ethnic unrest during the past
month in the southern Soviet republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan.

   More than 13,000 bottles of wine from the Crimean
winery that once belonged to the Russian czars will be auctioned in
March, Sotheby's says.
   The dessert and fortified wines include 1,155 bottles of
extremely rare pre-1918 wines, some still bearing the imperial
seal, the auction house said in a statement on Friday. All the
wines were bottled before 1945.
   ``Crimea was among the greatest producers of the classic sweet
wines that were so sought-after in the 19th century and which are
becoming fashionable again today,'' said Sotheby's.
   ``They have the greatest longevity of any wines, and are still
very drinkable now after 100 or even 150 years,'' said the auction
house, which said it expects the wines to sell for as much as
several hundred dollars a bottle.
   Sotheby's said the wines from the former imperial winery, called
Massandra, have rarely been tasted outside the Soviet Union. The
winery still is in operation, it said.

   Grandparents with toddlers, parents with babies
and thousands of others crowded today into a photo exhibition
dedicated to the pro-democracy movement in China that was crushed
by troops last month.
   Titled ``Awakening,'' the photo exhibition at the Arts Center
depicted events in Beijing from the death in April of former
Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang to the student movement and
military crackdown on June 3-4.
   It included several huge color pictures of students fasting as
well as the well-known picture of a lone man standing defiantly in
front of a line of tanks.
   The exhibition also included a letter from soldiers supporting
the students, and pictures of Chinese leaders condemning the
pro-democracy movement as social turmoil.
   Many visitors crowded over an old newspaper page which showed
the bloody remains of a body crushed by a tank.
   A 10-minute multi-screen slide show accompanied by songs heard
during the movement, including the Internationale, began with the
causalities on Changan Boulevard in Beijing on June 3-4.
   It ended with a student yelling ``Freedom! Freedom!'' in front
of a row of soldiers in Beijing. The voice was drowned in a volley
of gunshot.
   An organizer of the exhibition, Peter Yung, said: ``We think the
stage of action (marches) is over. We need to educate the public.
We hope to set up a fund to help people conduct research and
studies in the democracy movement and then publish some books.''
   ``The stage of mourning is over. We need to go back to our
position and calmly review the situation,'' Yung said.
   The exhibition ends Thursday.

   Rose Kennedy, matriarch of the Kennedy clan,
celebrates her 99th birthday today surrounded by more than 40
family members.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy planned to present his mother with 99
roses. Among the family members who will share Mrs. Kennedy's
favorite chocolate birthday cake with her at tonight's celebration
at the Hyannis Port compound on Cape Codare granddaughter Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg, 31, and her year-old daughter, Rose.
   ``We're headed down there right now,'' Michael Kennedy, 31, the
son of Robert F. Kennedy, said Friday from his office at Citizens
Energy Corp. in Boston. ``All the grandchildren are going to be
there. I'm bringing my three children as well.''
   Kennedy said a special Mass was planned for his grandmother. The
family also planned to have a pianist at the celebration to play
Mrs. Kennedy's favorite tunes.
   Dr. Robert Watt, 70, of Centerville, who was Mrs. Kennedy's
doctor until his retirement two years ago, said Mrs. Kennedy is no
longer able to walk and has very poor vision. But he said she can
recognize people.
   ``She's a very old lady,'' said Watt, who last saw Mrs. Kennedy
two months ago. ``She has moments when she's lucid. She's more
alert than one would expect. Sometimes it's difficult for me to
tell if she knows me or not. Once when I came by, the nurses told
her who I was and she turned to me and said `Hello, Dr. Watt, how
kind of you to come.'''
   Watt said that Mrs. Kennedy is visited by family members on a
regular basis.
   ``They're a very close family,'' he said. ``The family spends a
lot of time there. There's always someone there. And she knows
them.''
   Watt attributes Mrs. Kennedy's longevity to a ``very prudent
life. She doesn't drink, smoke and she's always watched her diet
carefully. Her mother lived well into her 90s also.
   ``Strength is still her major characteristic. She's strong in
her beliefs.''
   Mrs. Kennedy was born July 22, 1890. Four of her nine children
were killed in their prime _ Joseph Kennedy Jr. and Kathleen in
plane crashes, John and Robert by assassins' bullets.
   Michael Kennedy said his grandmother's long life stems from
``her faith.''
   ``I think it's in the genes. I just hope I have it also.''

   Clergy and psychologists are counseling
the survivors of the United Airlines crash, many of whom are
beginning to suffer guilt over failing to save those who died.
   At Marian Health Center, where 29 victims from United Airlines
Flight 232 were hospitalized, mental health director Marcene Moran
said she and her three-member staff spent Friday talking with
survivors and emergency workers who responded to the disaster.
   ``The crash is really starting to bother them because of some of
the things they've seen and the crisis behavior they've had to
exhibit to get through this,'' she said.
   Pilot Al Haynes and his DC-10 crew were among the patients at
the hospital. They are ``feeling a great deal of sadness'' at not
having brought the plane down safely.
   ``They feel responsible,'' said Ms. Moran. Haynes is credited
with saving many lives by getting the jet to the edge of a runway
at Sioux Gateway Airport before crashing. ``We're trying to help
them reach the mind set that they did all they could in the given
set of circumstances,'' she said.
   Ms. Moran said some patients have blotted the wreck out of their
memories. In others, initial relief at survival has given way to
guilt and anger.
   ``Some of them are upset that they ran from the plane,'' she
said. ``One gentleman was angry that he went back but only helped
one person out when he thought he could have gotten more.''
   Ms. Moran said she has advised all of the survivors to seek
psychological counseling when they get home.
   Many emergency workers at first claim to be suffering no
emotional trauma, but counseling brings out upset, she said.
   ``They've come face to face with a kind of tragedy that most
people never deal with,'' she said. ``It always brings you to
confront your own possible death.''
   The Rev. Mark Duchaine, a Roman Catholic priest who has attended
to the injured and sought to comfort relatives and friends, says he
can't wipe the scene of the crash from his mind.
   ``The carnage at the airport was just unbelievable,'' Duchaine
said.
   ``Out there at the airport walking amidst the bodies and the
debris that just seemed to have disintegrated into millions of
pieces, it was like Dante's Inferno. I'll never forget it.''
   Following the wreck, Duchaine went immediately to the airport
runway, stopping at each body he found to kneel and offer last
rites. Since, he has worked with the living.
   ``When you're with these families and they're hurting, you wish
you could take some of that hurt upon yourself,'' said Duchaine.

<HEAD>Government Cuts Enrollment, Urges More Media Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: LEADS with eight grafs to UPDATE with China cutting university
enrollments; picks up 2nd graf pvs: News and... ^By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Propaganda officials called for stricter control
of the media to protect socialism, and education officials today
said the government was cutting enrollment at colleges where the
pro-democracy movement was born.
   China's State Education Commission said freshman university
enrollment nationwide would be cut by 30,000 from the planned
enrollment of 640,000. It said the cut was necessary because many
schools have been enrolling more students than they could handle.
   It also cited problems with job placements and said some
low-priority majors, including the social sciences, need to be
``rectified ... to be in accordance with the needs of the building
of socialism.''
   An admissions official at Beijing University, who did not give
his name, said: ``The universities and colleges whose students
actively participated in the student movement will cut enrollment.''
   Beijing University students were at the forefront of the
now-suppressed movement for greater freedoms.
   An admissions official at People's University, who also did not
give his name, said the cuts were ordered ``because of the student
movement and political reasons, not because there are any problems
with the university.''
   Several students at Beijing University, speaking on condition of
anonymity, also said they felt the enrollment cuts were related to
the student movement.
   The people in charge of China's propaganda machine, meanwhile,
continued to call for a purge of publications that don't toe the
socialist line.
   ``News and publishing units, social science research organs,
literary and art groups ... must propagate and seriously carry out
the four basic principles,'' the party newspaper, the People's
Daily, said the officials decided.
   The four principles in essence declare that China must be ruled
only by the Communist Party under the principles of Marxism,
Leninism and Mao Tse-tung. That idea has been part of the
ideological gospel for a decade under senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
but tends to be stressed only in times of suppression on emergent
liberalism.
   The officials, heads of propaganda departments and cultural
censors natiowide, declared as their five-day meeting ended Friday
that the cultural market must be ``rectified'' _ meaning shaken up
_ and purged of reactionary materials.
   Beijing and several other leading cities already have begun
raiding book stalls to seize the works of intellectuals who took
part in the crushed democracy movement.
   The coastal city of Fujian announced it has ``rectified'' the
video games market, pool halls and dance halls and plans to start
in on the videotape market.
   The message of the propaganda meeting was that such efforts must
be spread to every town and village, and must not stop with a few
raids as in China's last hard-line political campaign in 1987.
   China's culture minister and vice minister, Wang Meng and Ying
Ruochen, were conspicuously absent from the meeting, as they have
been since the June 3-4 army attack on student-led protesters.
   Wang and Ying had advocated a policy that the arts would
flourish only if political interference was reduced.
   The meeting was presided over by the head of the national party
Propaganda Department, Wang Renzhi, at times joined by party
General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng.
   An editorial, apparently produced by the meeting, filled half
the front page of today's People's Daily. It attacked the popular
view in the West that Marxism is outdated and socialism has failed,
as witnessed by the troubled economies and restless populations of
the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and China.
   ``For some time political forces in capitalist countries ...
have played up the so-called crisis in socialism,'' it said.
   Even in China, it said, some people ``publicly declare: the
attempt at socialism and its failure is the great legacy of the
20th century.'''
   The editorial revealed that in early 1987, as China cracked down
on an earlier series of student marches for democracy, now-ousted
party leader Zhao Ziyang told a party meeting: ``No one really
knows what the sociaist road is.''
   In another apparent reference to Zhao, it said ``some comrades
did not speak much of the struggle between socialism and
capitalism, as if with one cry of `detente' the boundaries between
socialism and capitalism would be eradicated. In reality, it is not
like this.''
   Public criticism of Zhao has mounted steadily since his June 24
ouster from his party posts. Revelations of comments he allegedly
made at closed meetings have been cited to prove his softness on
Western-style liberalism.
   None of the articles explain how Zhao managed to win
confirmation in October 1987 as party chief.

<HEAD>Parties Give Green Light to Form New Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Political leaders gave the green light to formation
of Italy's 49th postwar government, a coalition to be led by
five-time premier Giulio Andreotti.
   Andreotti was expected to form the government today, presenting
a list of Cabinet ministers to President Francesco Cossiga. The
coalition would succeed one led by Christian Democrat Premier
Ciriaco De Mita that fell two months ago.
   Leaders of the five parties that have governed in a coalition in
recent years met with Andreotti Friday and approved his proposed
program.
   ``After this evening's meeting, the crisis can be considered
definitely resolved,'' Socialist Party leader Bettino Craxi told
reporters after the three-hour session.
   No major changes in policy were expected.
   The last government fell when Craxi criticized De Mita's
leadership shortly before the European Parliament elections. Most
observers said Craxi expected his party to make electoral gains and
wanted to be able to parlay them into a stronger position in
government. However, the Socialists recorded only a slight increase.
   The Socialists are the second-largest party in the government
after the dominant Christian Democrats. Also in the coalition are
the small Republican, Liberal and Social Democrat parties.
   Italy's second-largest party, the Communists, have been kept out
of government for four decades.
   Andreotti, a Christian Democrat, was asked to form a government
two weeks ago after De Mita failed to revive the 13-month-old
coalition that collapsed on May 19.
   Andreotti, who served as foreign minister in the De Mita
government, was premier twice in 1972-73 and three times
successively in 1976-79.

   Moslem rebels fired seven rockets into

officials said.
   Witnesses said one rocket struck about 100 yards from the office
of Prime Minister Ali Kishtmand and another hit about 50 yards from
the Foreign Ministry compound. Several windows were shattered by
the impact, they said.
   The government closed the area around all ministry buildings.
   ``This is a very serious attack,'' said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani. He had no breakdown of casualties,
saying the government was waiting for more information.
   Witnesses said most of the victims were at a bus terminal near
the city's center.
   ``It is one of the worst rocket attacks in recent months,'' said
Sarwar Wisil, chief ot Jamhuriat Hospial, where at least 57 people
were admitted, many in critical condition.
   The guerrillas, backed by the United States and based in
neighboring Pakistan and Iran, have been fighting for 11 years to
overthrow the Soviet-supported government of President Najib.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dominant party in Greece's coalition
government has asked Parliament to investigate allegations that
former socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou ordered politicians'
phones tapped.
   The request, submitted Friday by 144 deputies of the
center-right New Democracy Party, was expected to pass in the
300-seat Parliament with the support of the 28 deputies of the
Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress, which governs
with New Democracy.
   The proposal accuses Papandreou of ordering taps on the
telephones of President Christos Sartzetakis, political rivals, his
own Cabinet ministers and military officials.
   It also charges that three former heads of the Ministry of
Transport and Communications were involved in the alleged
eavesdropping.
   Papandreou was premier for eight years but his Panhellenic
Socialist Movement lost in last month's general elections. New
Democracy and the Communist-led group agreed to form a short-term
coalition aimed at investigating scandals that occurred during
Papandreou's rule.
   New Democracy's proposal to set up a 12-member committee to
investigate the phone-tapping charges will be discussed by the
unicameral Parliament next Thursday.
   ``We propose criminal prosecution ... on the accountability of
government members and ministers,'' the proposal said.
   Parliament also has ordered an investigation into Papandreou's
alleged involvement in a multimillion-dollar financial scandal
involving fugitive Greek banker George Koskotas.
   A 12-member investigative committee was formed Friday to
investigate the charges.
   The Koskotas scandal and other charges of widespead corruption
and wrongdoing led to the fall of Papandreou's government in the
June 18 elections.
   The governing coalition says it is carrying out a ``catharsis,''
or clean up of government.
   Government spokesman Athanassios Kannelopoulos reiterated Friday
that ``the catharsis will be carried out in such a time period so
that the elections will be held in October.''

<HEAD>Divers Cut Steel Plates From Valdez Hull</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Divers removed six of the seven steel plates
dangling from the Exxon Valdez's hull that had kept the damaged oil
tanker from entering port for repairs.
   Representatives of Exxon and the state of California met Friday
to settle environmental conditions the company must meet before
bringing the ship through San Diego Bay to the National Steel and
Shipbuilding Co. yard.
   The state wants guarantees from Exxon that the leak-prone Valdez
will make a pollution-free passage through state waters, which
extend three miles from shore.
   ``The primary objective is to find a way to get the ship
repaired while protecting the resources of the state,'' said
Anthony Summers, a deputy attorney general.
   The Valdez was about 54 miles off San Diego near San Clemente
Island, where interim repairs were being carried out to allow the
tanker to navigate the shallows of San Diego Harbor.
   Exxon Shipping Co. spokeswoman Jan Cool said the divers
inspected the ship's bottom Thursday night and found a seventh
steel plate had peeled away from the frame. Six of the plates had
been removed Friday.
   The Valdez's hull ruptured on rocks in Alaska's Prince William
Sound on March 24, spilling some 11 million gallons of crude in the
nation's worst oil spill.
   The ship received a two-month scrubbing before being towed to
the San Diego area, where it is to undergo a nine-month, $25
million repair.
   Coast Guard officials suspended the Valdez' scheduled harbor
entry on July 10, when an 18-mile oil slick was sighted near the
ship and an underwater inspection revealed the dangling plates.
   A Coast Guard observer aboard the ship had reported no signs of
discharge during four days, but reported a brown substance about 20
yards in diameter floating 50 yards from the Valdez on Friday.

<TEXT>
   The news director of an Iowa television
station threatened to sue other stations if they refused to pay
extra for exclusive footage of the crash of United Airlines Flight
232.
   KTIV-TV in Sioux City, an NBC affiliate, intended the exclusive
footage of the tumbling, burning DC-10 jet to be used only by NBC
Nightly News and other NBC affiliates, KTIV news director Van
Carter said Friday.
   But it played on other networks' affiliates, including rival
KCAU in Sioux City, after it was transmitted from Sioux City to NBC
in New York via a satellite channel owned by Minneapolis-based
Conus Communications.
   ``For those who didn't ask, they are going to get billed
substantially more than those who did,'' Carter said. ``If they
don't want to pay it, then yes, we may wind up with legal action.''
   Conus, a news service that feeds 133 television stations, said
it obtained the footage from WOWT of Omaha, Neb., which has a
reciprocal agreement to share footage with KTIV and was sent to
transmit the footage to NBC News.
   Technical and time restraints prompted WOWT to use Conus'
satellite channel to transmit the video instead of feeding it
directly to NBC, said Conus spokesman Steve Blum.
   After being assured by WOWT and a KTIV reporter that the two
stations shared videotapes, Conus made the video available to its
members through WOWT, Blum said.
   Conus later talked to a KTIV manager, who granted Conus the
rights to the video for $300, Blum said.
   ``We weren't trying to rip anybody off,'' Blum said. ``We got
permission.''
   Carter said the situation with Conus was ``confused,'' and that
Conus may not be at fault. But he said Conus should have checked
with him, not a reporter, before releasing the video.

   Tens of thousands of people attended funeral
services for popular singer Hibari Misora in eight cities today,
and five of the country's six television networks broadcast the
Buddhist rites for up to four hours.
   Hibari, a symbol for millions of Japanese of Japan's postwar
perseverance and reconstruction, died of heart failure on June 24.
She was 52.
   She was posthumously honored with the People's Honor Award, a
prestigious decoration previously awarded by the government to only
five other celebrities.
   Police said an estimated 72,000 mourners attended the services
in Tokyo, Sapporo, Sendai, Nagoya, Osaka, Hiroshima, Takamatsu and
Fukuoka.
   About 42,000 people, including 100 who waited in line all night,
attended the main funeral rites in Tokyo, burning incense and
bowing their heads in prayer.
   They included Education Minister Takeo Nishioka, who read a
message of condolence. Twenty singers joined in singing a song
written by Hibari.
   Only one station, Japan's public broadcasting network, the Japan
Broadcasting Corp., did not broadcast the funeral services live.
   When Hibari died four weeks ago, TV networks canceled their
regular programs to broadcast film of her performances and
discussions of her career by music and film industry greats.
   During her lifetime, Hibari released 1,200 songs and sold about
68 million records. She also acted in several Japanese movies and
plays.
   She was little known abroad, except in China and Korea, because
she seldom sang or played outside Japan.

   Soviet sailors visiting the Norfolk Naval
Base were getting a taste of American life over the weekend _
shopping, eating burgers and pizza, and visiting a theme park.
   About 1,100 sailors aboard three Soviet warships arrived at the
world's largest naval base Friday. The only other post-World War II
visit by Soviet ships came in 1975 when two vessels stopped in
Boston.
   ``Our visit is taking place at a significant time,'' Vice Adm.
Igor V. Kasatonov, commander of the Soviet ships, said at a news
conference. ``New political thinking, the priority of general human
values, the course towards cooperation in solving global problems
are ever increasingly determining the world politics today.''
   Kasatonov said the Soviet Union was looking forward to regular
visits between the navies of the two superpowers. Three American
warships will stop in the Soviet Black Sea port of Sevastopol next
month.
   The public will be invited aboard two of the Soviet ships _ the
guided missile cruiser Marshal Ustinov and the destroyer Otlichny.
The tanker Gasanov will not be open to the public.
   The sailors' agenda includes bus trips to the Busch Gardens
amusement park in Williamsburg, meals at a pizza parlor and a
McDonald's restaurant, shopping at a Virginia Beach mall, a grocery
store and hardware shop.
   ``I want to know what Americans are interested in today, how
they live, how they feel about disarmament,'' said Oleg Ivanov, 20,
a sailor aboard the Ustinov. ``It will assist in our reapproachment
and we will be able to trust each other.''
   ``We have an opportunity to be witnesses of a very great event
in relations between our two countries,'' said Alexander Kabanov, a
22-year-old sailor of Moscow.

<HEAD>Schools Reopen for 200,000 Arab Children in West Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chants of Palestinian
children reciting Arabic and practicing multiplication tables rang
out today from schools in the West Bank that were reopened after a
seven-month army closure.
   ``I'm glad to be going back,'' said 9-year-old Lina Humseyeh as
she waited for a school bus to take her to her third-grade class.
``I helped my mother when we didn't have school, but I was bored.''
   The nearly 1,200 primary and secondary schools in the occupied
West Bank have been closed for most of the 19-month Palestinian
uprising, despite appeals from the United States and international
human rights organizations.
   The Israeli government contends that the schools are hotbeds of
violence. Twice before _ in May and December of last year _ the
army reopened and then closed schools, claiming students were
inciting the uprising.
   The schools that opened today are for 200,000 children in grades
one through six and for students in their senior year of high
school, the latter so they can study for mandatory graduation exams.
   No major incidents were reported today. In several West Bank
cities, more troops than normal were seen on main roads.
   Arab reports said curfews imposed on four villages and a refugee
camp near Nablus and Ramallah blocked students from going to
school. Three Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes with
soldiers near Nablus and in Gaza City.
   The army confirmed that one Palestinian was shot and wounded in
the Nur Shams refugee camp outside Nablus and said it was checking
the other reports.
   Throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, shops and businesses
were closed by a general strike ordered by the Moslem
fundamentalist movement Hamas, or Zeal. The strike did not affect
the first day of school because Hamas announced in a leaflet that
it favored children returning to class.
   Graffiti on a wall outside the United Nations-run school in the
Al-Amri refugee camp near Ramallah also called on students to
pursue their eductions.
   ``With stones and pens, the blessed uprising continues,'' read
one slogan, signed by Hamas.
   Before allowing classes to resume, army officials met with
school administrators and told them they would have to control
their students or the schools would be closed again.
   Samira Abdullah Mahmoud, principal of the Bethlehem Girls
School, said that Israeli soldiers, who previously parked jeeps
across from her elementary school, today stayed 50 yards away in an
apparent effort to reduce tensions.
   ``The children become nervous when they see soldiers outside,''
she said.
   She described the school's 404 elementary schoolgirls as
``obviously happy to be back.'' To make up for the lost school
time, she said, the girls will focus on Arabic, mathematics and
science. Electives such as physical education, music and art will
not be taught.
   ``We can't do physical education anyway,'' Mrs. Mahmoud said.
``During the closure, the soldiers tore down the wall around the
playground.''
   Residents in the area said that stones, the main weapon of the
uprising, had been hurled at passing army jeeps from behind the
wall.
   No date has been set for a resumption of classes for the
remaining 100,000 West Bank students in grades seven, eight, nine,
10 and 11. The army said that would depend on whether the initial
phase of reopenings was peaceful.
   While the army ordered schools closed in the West Bank shortly
after the start of the uprising in December 1987, classes have
continued for more than 150,000 students in the Gaza Strip.
   Colleges, universities and vocational schools in both
territories remain shut, affecting 20,000 students. No date for
reopening them has been set.

   Preparing for the last leg of his round-the-world
journey, 11-year-old pilot Tony Aliengena said when he gets home he
wants to ride his bike for a while ``and then I'd like to meet
President Bush, maybe.''
   The fourth-grader was to become the youngest person to fly a
plane around the world when he completed a 1,000-mile flight to
Orange County, Calif., today. He flew into Seattle on Friday in a
borrowed single-engine plane from Juneau, Alaska.
   Tony, who lives in San Juan Capistrano, Calif., left seven weeks
ago from nearby John Wayne International Airport on ``Friendship
Flight '89.''
   He is flying a borrowed plane because the single-engine Cessna
Centurion he started with crashed Tuesday while taking off from
Golovin, Alaska. Tony's flight-instructor father, Gary Aliengena,
was at the controls, and no one was seriously hurt.
   That crash, which is under investigation by the Federal Aviation
Administration because there were eight people aboard the six-seat
plane, was the only sour note on the 19,000-mile trip, Tony said
Friday night.
   Looking back on the 35 stops he made in seven countries, the boy
said he enjoyed himself.
   ``I really liked the Soviet Union, especially Moscow,'' he said.
``I also liked Boston because that's where all my relatives are.''
   Tony and his party, including his mother, Susan, and 10-year-old
sister Alaina, made 14 stops in the Soviet Union alone. In Moscow,
the Friendship Flight crew met with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   The boy is to meet President Bush at the White House next week.
   Tony said aviation will always be just a hobby.
   ``I want to be an orthopedic surgeon,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Pittston Coal Group Inc. will respond
next week to a United Mine Workers' proposal for ending a 15-week
strike, the company's president says.
   The union made two proposals Friday, said Bruce Bratten, an
assistant to UMW vice president Cecil Roberts.
   The union would try to address Pittston's need for miners to
work on Sundays if Pittston gives assurances that any new mines
opened by the company will employ some of the 4,000 Pittston
employees who have been laid off.
   The second proposal was a request in writing that the two sides
meet face to face. Negotiators have been meeting in separate rooms
at a motel with federal mediators carrying messages back and forth.
   Pittston Coal president Michael Odom said there was ``nothing
new'' in the UMW proposal.
   ``It's hardly a contract proposal,'' Odom said. ``If they want
to play games, fine, but I thought we were going to see something
of substance.''
   But Odom said the company would give a definitive response next
week.
   A recess was agreed up for the talks until Tuesday, amid
accusations of bad faith on both sides.
   ``It's really frustrating,'' Bratten said. ``We came in here and
stated we were willing to stay and continue this on. It's hard to
come to an agreement when you can't get someone to sit at a table
across from you.''
   The union has charged that Pittston's proposals would undermine
UMW members' job security and hopes of future coal employment.
   UMW miners in Virginia and West Virginia struck Pittston on
April 5 and the company's Kentucky operations were struck in June.
About 1,900 miners are on strike in the three states.
   Thousands of others miners throughout the east joined in a
monthlong wildcat strike that ended last week.
   Meanwhile, 42 people were charged with conspiracy to commit a
felony following a rock-throwing incident in Dickenson County, in
southwest Virginia. Those charged allegedly pelted a state trooper
with rocks.

<HEAD>17-Year-Old Could be Third Youngest Grandmaster in History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Adams, a 17-year-old British chess player,
won an international competition in London and is expected to be
the third youngest player in history to be awarded a grandmaster
title.
   Adams scored seven points out of nine in the Iclicki Masters
tournament on Friday to achieve his third grandmaster performance
in less than a year. He is expected to have his new title ratified
by the International Chess Federation at its annual Congress next
month in Puerto Rico.
   British chess experts said Bobby Fischer of the United States
and the current world champion, Soviet Garri Kasparov, are the only
players to have gained chess' top honor at an earlier age. Fischer,
who held the world title from 1972 to 1975, became a grandmaster at
15. Kasparov did that at 16.
   ``To the best of my knowledge, Michael is third,'' said Malcolm
Pein, a British international master and chess writer.
   After agreeing to a draw in his final round game, Adams said he
was ``drained,'' but added: ``Things have gone very well recently.''
   ``He's extremely talented. If he can fulfill his potential he
will reach the highest echelons of world chess,'' said Jonathan
Speelman, a British grandmaster who has reached the semi-final
stage of the world championship and trains with Adams.
   Adams is registered as a high school student in Truro in
southwest England, but admits to taking increasing amounts of time
off to play in tournaments.
   He has competed in the United States and Australia and his chess
prowess netted $17,000 in prize money last year. Now he will be
eligible for the hefty appearance monies regularly offered to
grandmasters.
   Adams said he practises ``very little'' at home and prefers to
work on his game with a partner. ``You always get a lot more done
and far more objective opinions with two,'' he said.
   Away from chess, Adams likes pop music, television, traveling
abroad and meeting with friends. He also likes to surf along the
Cornish coastline.
   ``Just flat board, nothing spectacular,'' he said. ``I would
probably be on a beach in Cornwall if I wasn't playing here.''
   He was taught the moves at the age of eight by his father, a
teacher, and went on to win the British under-11 championship.
   At 12, he shot to fame when he was the only junior to hold
Kasparov to a draw during an exhibition of simultaneous chess games.
   Adams' ranking might be threatened by other juniors. Joel
Lautier, a French 15-year-old, has achieved two of the required
three grandmaster performances.
   And Judit Polgar, 13, the youngest member of a remarkable trio
of Hungarian sisters, missed her first grandmaster result at a
tournament in New York in the spring by just half a point.
   ``There are more opportunities now,'' Adams said. ``There is so
much more around for players at a younger age.''

<HEAD>Bomb Explodes In Northern Ireland During Defusing Attempt</HEAD>

   A 100-pound bomb exploded on a
bridge near the Irish border while an army expert tried to defuse
it with a remote-control robot, police said today.
   A pub across the border in the Irish Republic was damaged by the
force of the explosion Friday night, but no one was injured, said a
spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, speaking anonymously.
   The robot the expert used while trying to defuse the bomb looks
like a tiny tank and is codenamed ``wheelbarrow,'' the spokesman
said.
   Considerable damage was done to the bridge at Moybridge, near
Aughnacloy, and it will be closed, the spokesman said.
   In mainly Roman Catholic west Belfast, a bomb trap was foiled
Friday night when a soldier patrolling Andersonstown Road spotted
an electric command wire, which someone could set off some distance
away, and alerted his colleagues. Police said the wire led to a
six-pound Semtex bomb packed with nuts and bolts.
   Also Friday, two hand grenades were thrown at the perimeter
fence of a police station in Craigavon, County Armagh, but police
said they caused little damage and no injuries.

<HEAD>Poaching Increases After South African Troops Leave Namibia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poaching of elephants and rhinoceroses
has increased dramatically since the withdrawal of South African
army units, a police official said today.
   Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand said the territorial police force
has formed three anti-poaching units to try to fill the void
created after nearly all South African troops left earlier this
year as part of a U.N.-supervised plan to bring independence to
Namibia.
   He said the units consisted mainly of black constables who
formerly served in Koevoet, a counterinsurgency force active in the
23-year bush war against guerrillas of SWAPO, the South-West Africa
People's Organization. Many Koevoet members were expert trackers.
   Police have reported the arrest of 30 suspected poachers in the
past six weeks, but wildlife experts say stronger measures are
needed to halt the smuggling of ivory and rhino horns out of
Namibia.
   According to the South African-based Rhino and Elephant
Foundation, at least 11 black rhinos and 30 elephants have been
killed by poachers in Namibia since June. The black rhino is one of
the most endangered species of large mammals, with only about 3,500
believed to exist worldwide.
   Two months ago, Namibian conservationists began an unprecedented
experimental program to deter rhino poachers by removing the horns
of some of the animals. The horns can earn thousands of dollars for
smugglers from buyers in Asia who use them to make potions and
dagger handles.
   Some conservationists have complained that the U.N. military and
police contingents observing the independence process in Namibia
are uninterested in assisting wildlife protection programs.
   The poaching issue was among several topics discussed Friday
during talks in Pretoria between South African Foreign Minister Pik
Botha and U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   South Africa, which took control of Namibia during World War I,
has agreed to grant independence as part of a regional peace accord
that also calls for withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola,
Namibia's northern neighbor.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II wrapped up a nine-day
vacation in northern Italy by visiting a show of Soviet art.
   The pope visited the exhibit Friday in Turin on his way back to
Rome from Introd, an Alpine town near the French border where he
had spent his vacation hiking and relaxing.
   ``A quick visit, but some impressions remain,'' the Polish-born
pontiff said after viewing the show of 260 works created from 1870
to 1930. ``There is the Russian and Soviet history, but one also
sees the religious influence, particularly of the icons.''
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the pope accepted the
invitation to see the exhibit ``because it is an exposition of
Russian and Soviet art _ a visit therefore that assumes a
significance of opening, in the point of view of the Holy Father,
for whom Europe goes from the Atlantic to the Urals.''
   Relations between the Vatican and Moscow have been improving in
recent years. The pope has said he would like to visit the Soviet
Union, but only if he could go to Lithuania and other heavily
Catholic areas.
   The art show was sponsored by Fiat, the Soviet Ministry of
Culture and the Italy-USSR Association.

<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan jokingly said he feels
``somewhat qualified'' for induction into the National Cowboy Hall
of Fame because of a much-publicized fall from a horse in Mexico on
July 4.
   On Friday, the former president was inducted into the museum's
Hall of Great Westerners _ a honor bestowed on a wide range of
Westerners ranging from pioneers to presidents to cattlemen. Reagan
also was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame.
   Reagan also said during the induction ceremony that he was now a
full-fledged rancher, with a spread that's grown from eight acres
to nearly 700.
   ``I just want you to know I will always treasure this award,
even though I didn't get into as many westerns as I would have
liked,'' Reagan told the cheering gathering of 800.
   The 78-year-old Reagan, wearing a dark pin-striped suit, was in
a half-dozen Western movies, but he said he would have preferred to
have been in many more. In all, he was in 53 films.
   Reagan said he wrangled often with Jack Warner, head of Warner
Bros. studios, for a part in Westerns and once feared that if he
ever did get into a Western it would be as ``an Eastern lawyer.''
   Before entering the Western museum, nestled on Persimmon Hill
near the famed Chisolm Trail, Reagan posed for photographs in front
of a ``calvary re-enactment group'' from the nearby town of Guthrie
and a group of mock U.S. marshals.
   Two volleys from a cannon welcomed the former president to his
first visit to the national Western shrine.
   William Arrington of Pampa, Texas, president of the hall's board
of directors, presented Reagan with a bronze replica of the Charles
M. Russell statue ``The Wrangler,'' in recognition of his induction
into the Hall of Western Performers.
   Reagan is the first performer to be honored since Dale Robertson
and Kirk Douglas were inducted in 1984. Others inductees include
such Western film stars as Tom Mix, Gary Cooper, Gene Autry, Walter
Brennan, Roy Rogers, Dale Evans and Jimmy Stewart.
   Western films Reagan appeared in included ``Santa Fe Trail,''
``Law and Order,'' ``Tennessee Partner,'' and ``Cattle Queen of
Montana,'' with Barbara Stanwyck, who also has been inducted.
   Reagan also received a bronze medallion in recognition of his
induction into the Hall of Great Westerners, a group that also
includes Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Dwight
Eisenhower.

   Some Ukrainian coal miners reportedly returned to
the pits as the nation's coal minister tried today to end their
crippling strike, but hundreds of thousands of miners elsewhere
ignored the official appeals.
   The strikes, the country's worst labor unrest in six decades,
began July 11. Fuel was reportedly running out at vital Soviet
industries, and President Mikhail Gorbachev has called for
replacing party officials whom he accused of taking a ``passive,
waiting position'' on economic reforms.
   A receptionist at the Communist Party office in the eastern
Ukraine city of Donetsk said the coal minister, Mikhail I.
Shchadov, today spoke to a rally of 3,000 miners in the central
square.
   The receptionist, interviewed by phone, said she had no details
of his remarks, but there were indications the miners were
receiving him well.
   About 300,000 miners in the area, the Donetsk Basin, have been
striking since July 15. They have held out for more concessions
than those granted to Siberian miners who began the strikes July 11
but returned to work earlier this week. They gained pay increases,
pledges of more consumer goods and greater control over their
industry.
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya today reported the number of
striking mines in Donetsk fell to 70 from 94 on Friday. The region
has 121 mines.
   The Donetsk Basin contains the country's largest coal field.
   But the paper and the labor daily Trud said miners remained off
the job at all 26 mines in the Karaganda Basin of the southern
republic of Kazakhstan, at 11 of 13 mines in Vorkuta in the Pechora
Basin in the Arctic, and at all 12 mines in Chervonograd in the
western Ukraine.
   The reports indicated half the coal industry's 1 million workers
were involved in the walkout.
   Among their demands, the Donetsk miners want 45 days of vacation
a year, rather than the 42 granted to Siberian miners, Trud said,
quoting a strike leader identified as V. Koval.
   The Karaganda miners are demanding, among other things, that
nuclear weapons tests be stopped at the Semipalatinsk range in
Kazakhstan and that destruction of medium-range nuclear weapons be
stopped elsewhere in the republic, according to Trud. The miners
say these activities harm the environment.
   In the face of the growing unrest, Communist Party leaders have
bemoaned what they called ideological confusion in the party under
reforms. In speeches published Friday by the party newspaper
Pravda, the leaders said party activists were hampered by
opposition forces unleashed by the reforms. They called for tight
restrictions on the press and a clear second-in-command.
   Gorbachev, who assumed power in 1985, has encouraged more open
debate as part of his efforts to restructure Soviet society and the
economy. Ethnic groups and workers, however, have used the climate
of greater openness to put forth long-simmering demands.
   Gorbachev, in a speech to party leaders on Tuesday, said some
party officials had taken a ``passive, waiting position'' and
longed for a return to ``good times'' to avoid making the difficult
decisions required to improve the country. These officials _
including some of those at the very top in the Politburo _ must be
replaced, he said without naming names.
   The economic toll and threat to the coke and steel industries
were a major theme of today's press reports. Coke is a coal
derivative also used as a fuel.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said the steel industry was in a ``critical
state'' because it lacked coal.
   A Karaganda steel plant director said he had only a day's worth
of coal reserves, and steelworkers in Pavlograd in the Donetsk
Basin said they had only a two-day supply, newspapers reported.
   Pravda said a boiler station and an asphalt plant in Pavlograd
have shut down because of the fuel shortage.
   Trud said the Kuznetsk strike has blocked production of $103
million worth of coal.
   The strikes coincided with nationalist violence that has nearly
paralyzed western Soviet Georgia. Tass said today that assailants
on Friday attacked a patrol that was clearing roadblocks in the
region, killing two police cadets.

<HEAD>Press Reports say Hitachi, Cray to Exchange Technology on Supercomputers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cray Research Inc. of the United States, the
world's largest supercomputer maker, and Hitachi, Ltd. have agreed
to share technology in Cray's first deal with a Japanese computer
maker, media reports said today.
   Hitachi and Cray officials were not immediately available for
comment.
   The nationally circulated Asahi Shimbun newspaper, Japan
Broadcasting Corp., and Kyodo News Service, all quoting
unidentified ``industry sources,'' said the two have agreed to
exchange supercomputer hardware technology, including circuits for
high-speed analysis of scientific information.
   New technology as yet to be patented by either company as well
as existing technology will be shared, the reports said.
   Kyodo News Service reported the agreement will enable Hitachi to
obtain technology from Cray, which has more experience than Hitachi
in supercomputers, and will allow Hitachi, which has never sold
supercomputers overseas, to step into the U.S. and European
supercomputer markets.
   The deal also helps Hitachi avoid patent troubles with the
Minneapolis-based Cray, Asahi reported.
   Meanwhile, the agreement will give Cray access to Japanese
technology and help it expand sales in Japan by using Hitachi's
marketing network, Kyodo said.
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a daily business newspaper, reported
today that Hitachi also made an agreement with Hewlett-Packard Co.,
based in Palo Alto, Calif., to share technology to produce
sophisticated computer work stations.
   News reports say Hitachi's deals with Cray may ease trade
friction with the United States, which under the Super 301 clause
of a new U.S. trade law cited supercomputer trade as one area in
which Japan maintains unfair trade practices that exclude American
products.

   Ukrainian leaders of a coal strike today reached a
proposed settlement with the government, but workers rejected the
pact and continued the walkout with hundreds of thousands of Soviet
miners elsewhere, Tass said.
   Fuel was reportedly running out at vital Soviet industries, and
President Mikhail Gorbachev has called for replacing Communist
Party officials whom he accused of taking a ``passive, waiting
position'' on economic reforms.
   Tass, the official news agency, said miners in the eastern
Ukrainian city of Donetsk rejected the agreement even though the
government met most of their demands.
   ``The strikers insist on the immediate satisfaction of their
conditions for miners going on pension, which is not within the
competence of local authorities, and also that the government
guarantee fulfillment of their demands,'' the official news agency
said.
   It did not give details.
   About 300,000 in the area, the Donetsk Basin, have been striking
since July 15.
   The strike began July 11 in western Siberia. Those miners,
however, returned to work earlier this week after winning pay
raises, pledges of more consumer goods, and more control over their
industry.
   Donetsk Basin miners have been holding out for more concessions
than those granted to the Siberian miners.
   Tass, reporting from Donetsk, said all mines in the area had
stopped.
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya had reported earlier in the
day that the number of striking mines in area fell from 94 to 70.
The region has a total of 121 mines. That report was apparently
based on information from Friday.
   Alexander E. Makarsky, a television journalist in Donetsk, said
in a telephone interview that the proposed settlement in his region
included pay increases and earlier pension eligibility. In
addition, he said, vacations would generally have been extended to
42 days a year, with more time offered to miners working in
especially difficult or dangerous conditions. It was not
immediately clear how much vacation time the miners now get.
   He said a government negotiator appeared on local television and
radio appealing for end to the strike in light of the agreement.
   Earlier today, a receptionist at the Communist Party office in
the city of Donetsk said the coal minister, Mikhail I. Shchadov,
spoke to a rally of 3,000 miners in the central square.
   The Donetsk Basin contains the country's largest coal field.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya and the labor daily Trud said miners
remained off the job at all 26 mines in the Karaganda Basin of the
southern republic of Kazakhstan, at 11 of 13 mines in Vorkuta in
the Pechora Basin in the Arctic, and at all 12 mines in
Chervonograd in the western Ukraine.
   The reports indicated half the coal industry's 1 million workers
were involved in the walkout.
   The Karaganda miners are demanding, among other things, that
nuclear weapons tests be stopped at the Semipalatinsk range in
Kazakhstan and that destruction of medium-range nuclear weapons be
stopped elsewhere in the republic, according to Trud. The miners
say these activities harm the environment.
   In the face of the growing unrest, Communist Party leaders have
bemoaned what they called ideological confusion in the party under
reforms. In speeches published Friday by the party newspaper
Pravda, the leaders said party activists were hampered by
opposition forces unleashed by the reforms. They called for tight
restrictions on the press and a clear second-in-command.
   Gorbachev, who assumed power in 1985, has encouraged more open
debate as part of his efforts to restructure Soviet society and the
economy. Ethnic groups and workers, however, have used the climate
of greater openness to put forth long-simmering demands.
   The Soviet president, in a speech to party leaders on Tuesday,
said some party officials had taken a ``passive, waiting position''
and longed for a return to ``good times'' to avoid making the
difficult decisions required to improve the country. These
officials _ including some of those at the very top in the
Politburo _ must be replaced, he said without naming names.
   The economic toll and threat to the coke and steel industries
were a major theme of today's press reports. Coke is a coal
derivative also used as a fuel.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said the steel industry was in a ``critical
state'' because it lacked coal.
   A Karaganda steel plant director said he had only a day's worth
of coal reserves, and steelworkers in Pavlograd in the Donetsk
Basin said they had only a two-day supply, newspapers reported.
   Pravda said a boiler station and an asphalt plant in Pavlograd
have shut down because of the fuel shortage.
   Trud said the Kuznetsk strike has blocked production of $103
million worth of coal.
   The strikes coincided with nationalist violence that has nearly
paralyzed western Soviet Georgia. Tass said today that assailants
on Friday attacked a patrol that was clearing roadblocks in the
region, killing two police cadets.

   The pilot implored controllers to keep
crippled Flight 232 away from the city while an off-duty pilot
struggled on his knees with the throttle to help gain control of
the jetliner, investigators said.
   As the National Transportation Safety Board tried to determine
the cause of the explosion that led to the crash of the United
DC-10 on Wednesday, NTSB spokesman Jim Burnett recounted Friday
night some of the final minutes before the jetliner cartwheeled and
exploded into flames.
   An off-duty pilot offered his assistance after the rear engine
blew apart and the jet's hydraulic lines were severed, limiting the
plane's maneuverability. The hydraulic system is routed through the
tail and allows the pilot to manipulate wing and tail controls.
   The off-duty pilot, whom Burnett did not identify, was allowed
into the cockpit to help the co-pilot wrest control of the crippled
plane.
   The Washington Post identified the off-duty pilot as Dennis
Fitch, who was listed as a survivor by United.
   ``The only control mechanism that the crew had was to use engine
thrust,'' Burnett said. The off-duty pilot ``was on his knees
manipulating the throttle.''
   ``What you have here is a situation of two men desperately
trying to get whatever control they can out of the aircraft,'' he
said.
   Seven minutes before he attempted an emergency landing at Sioux
Gateway Airport, pilot Al C. Haynes told the control tower,
``Whatever you do, keep us away from the city,'' Burnett quoted
Haynes as telling investigators during two one-hour interviews on
Friday. The airport is about seven miles from downtown.
   City Manager Hank Sinda said this morning that one of the
injured victims whom he did not name died overnight, bringing the
death toll to 110. By his count, there were 186 survivors.
   Earlier, Burnett had said 297 people were on board _ two more
than earlier reports _ and that 186 survived, including one woman
who has not been identified. Burnett did not say why she had not
been identified.
   United Airlines late Friday revised its list of survivors and
brought its total to 187. United said 109 people died, while the
NTSB figures indicated a death toll of 111. United has not yet
released a list of victims.
   A flight attendant, Rene LeBeau, was listed as missing,
according to the Association of Flight Attendants. Ten crew members
survived.
   Forty-six survivors remained hospitalized; their conditions
range from critical to good.
   Meanwhile, Iowa National Guardsmen and investigators from the
FBI and the state Department of Criminal Investigation continued to
look for wreckage around Sioux Gateway Airport. They planned to
lift a large, blackened section of the fuselage lying in a
cornfield along the scorched runway where Haynes brought the
crippled jumbo jet down.
   Investigators on Friday narrowed their focus to the tail of the
jetliner and a blown rear engine that may have spewed pieces of
metal like shrapnel, wrecking the jet's steering system.
   The engine's manufacturer, General Electric Co., said its GE
Aircraft Engines division sent a five-member team to help
investigate.
   The crew of Flight 232 tried to get advice from the airline's
experts in San Francisco when Iowa officials on the ground couldn't
help them, The New York Times reported. The crisis aboard the DC-10
bound for Chicago from Denver was so unusual that it took the
experts 10 minutes to understand the problem's severity. Even then,
they offered no solutions, the newspaper reported today.
   In their 25-minute conversation with the experts, the crew
reported that they could only turn right.
   They reported that the jet had lost hydraulic control _ no
elevators, ailerons or flaps _ and the throttle for the damaged
rear engine could not be moved.
   A federal official close to the investigation told the Times
that the pilot once became impatient with the repeated questions
about the hydraulic problem and said: ``I'm telling the truth.''
   ABC News reported Friday that the navigational system at the
airport where the pilot was trying to land the plane had been
turned off.
   Glenn Bush, a Federal Aviation Administration manager in Des
Moines, said the system was scheduled to be shut down at noon on
Wednesday _ about four hours before the crash _ for maintenance.
   According to a federal aviation guide, the Sioux airport has a
VORTAC navigational system, which gives pilots the bearing and
range of an airport. Pilots use the information to check whether
they are on course.
   Bush said all pilots were notified of the shutdown weeks before,
and said it would probably not have been of use in any case.
   Investigators also were reviewing maintenance records on the
15-year-old jet. Burnett said repair work involving the rear engine
was done on the plane the day before the crash, to correct a
problem with the pneumatic system.
   The pneumatic system uses excess pressure generated by the giant
engine to power the aircraft's air-conditioning system. Burnett
said he did not think that problem would have affected the engine
itself.

<TEXT>
   The government is launching a new
television campaign this week to try to stem the spread of AIDS,
which has killed more than 3,500 people in this country.
   With 7,182 cases registered between 1980 and last June, Brazil
trails only the United States and France in the number of confirmed
AIDS cases, according to Dr. Lair Guerra da Macedo, director of the
National Division of Sexually Transmitted Diseases.
   The ``Project AIDS'' campaign will begin Wednesday with a series
of nationwide broadcasts by 18 well-known musicians, athletes, TV
personalities, and artists talking about the risks of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, the Health Ministry said.
   ``We can't lose this contest,'' says Zico, a 36-year-old soccer
star, in one of the TV spots.
   Among other personalities appearing in the spots are singer
Caetano Veloso, racing champion Ayrton Senna, and artist Ivo
Pitanguy.
   The Health Ministry has said the number of AIDS sufferers in
Brazil could rise to 38,000 by 1993.
   AIDS attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancers.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   On top of its troubles with sex and money scandals
and an unpopular new tax, the governing party goes into
parliamentary elections Sunday facing a loss of support from some
traditional backers _ the nation's farmers.
   Farm groups see the government as too weak in its stance against
U.S. demands for a wider opening of Japan's market to American
beef, oranges and other products. They fear the next step could be
an end to Japan's near ban on imports of rice, the nation's staple
food.
   For the governing Liberal Democratic Party, loss of farm support
comes at a bad time. Media polls indicate it faces serious setbacks
because of the 4-month-old sales tax, a widespread
influence-peddling scandal, and allegations that Prime Minister
Sousuke Uno kept paid mistresses.
   Because of the arrangement of Japan's electoral districts, a
rural vote is calculated as weighing up to six times as much as an
urban vote in Sunday's election for half the seats in Parliament's
upper house.
   ``It is the first election since the formation of the Liberal
Democratic Party (in 1955) that farmers, who have always been loyal
to the ruling party, so loudly expressed opposition to the LDP,''
said Takayoshi Miyagawa, president of Seiji Koho Center, a
prominent research firm.
   In the past, he said, farmers' opposition to certain policies
has not translated into votes for the opposition.
   Last month, however, a Socialist Party homemaker defeated an LDP
candidate in an upper house by-election in Niigata prefecture,
Japan's largest rice-growing district.
   ``Without the farmers' rebellion against the LDP, the Socialist
candidate couldn't have won in Niigata, which is traditionally a
conservative stronghold,'' said Masumi Ishikawa, a political
commentator for the national newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
   Like many other Japanese, he added, farmers were unhappy with
the 3 percent sales tax that took effect in April, making their
fertilizer and farm equipment more expensive.
   What angered farmers most, however, was the government's timid
attitude toward U.S. demands to open Japan's agricultural markets
wider, said Yasushi Akiba, an official at Agricultural Cooperatives
in Yamagata, in northern Japan.
   Japan, already the best foreign customer for American farmers,
has agreed to remove quotas on imported beef and oranges in 1991.
It also opened its market to 10 other farm products after an
international trade body upheld a U.S. complaint.
   ``Japanese farming is not yet competitive enough to stand
against foreign products,'' said Tokuo Matsumoto, executive
director of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, the
most powerful farm lobby. ``Simply exposing Japan's agriculture to
foreign competition at this point will permanently jeopardize this
country's agriculture.''
   The cooperatives' prefectural organ in Yamagata has decided not
to support the local LDP candidate.
   ``There is a sense of crisis mounting among farmers about the
future of Japan's agriculture,'' said Akiba. ``We have long
supported the LDP, but we can't find party policies to protect us.
We are concerned such a weak stance by the LDP may eventually
sacrifice Japan's rice market.''
   At least 17 local farm lobby groups have officially decided not
to endorse LDP candidates. Three of them are endorsing their own
candidates to run against the governing party.
   It is unclear to what extent farmers might turn to opposition
parties.
   ``Farmers are aware that the Socialists cannot necessarily
protect them either,'' said Ishikawa. ``It is yet to be seen if
they will actually go into the voting booth and write Socialist
Party members' names.''

   China's economy, which suffered from political
turmoil that turned major cities into battlegrounds, remains
weakened even though workers have left the barricades for the
assembly lines.
   Thousands of hours of production time were lost. Beijing alone
suffered $348 million in unspecified ``direct losses,'' according
to city officials.
   The state, which ran a $2.1 billion budget deficit last year,
suddenly faced the unbudgeted cost of transporting armies and tanks
to Beijing and repairing the damage caused by several days of
warfare between soldiers and angry crowds early last month.
   The country finds itself less equipped than ever to deal with
its ecomomic problems.
   Outside help has dwindled. Most of China's lenders have frozen
aid or postponed consideration of new loans while they watch
political developments. Trade and investment may also fall off as
foreign businessmen weigh possible profits against the political
uncertainties.
   Debate in economic theory, as in other fields, has been
silenced, and several leading economic think tanks face government
``rectification'' after having sided with now-ousted Communist
Party chief Zhao Ziyang.
   Reform measures favored by Zhao, such as widening China's tiny
but flourishing private sector, increasing stock sales by
state-owned companies and streamlining oversized work forces, have
been discredited.
   Instead, the aging revolutionary veterans who returned to center
stage against Zhao are calling for hard work, plain living and
self-reliance. There is no more talk of price reform, although even
official news reports agree that China's semi-controlled price
system is in chaos.
   A recent article in the Economic Daily made the new emphasis
clear.
   ``Privatization of China is likely to reduce social development
in terms of education, culture, hygiene, environmental protection
and social welfare,'' wrote Fang Jue, a researcher at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences.
   Recent government policies, he said, ``put the public economy at
a disadvantaged position, losing ground to the private sector. That
is what we are going to reform.''
   The leaders also have begun a crackdown on corruption, which at
least one Western economist said may have been the only thing that
kept some markets functioning.
   In some industries such as steel, the state-set price is too low
to cover costs, and black market sales have become essential, said
the economist, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Perhaps most important, the political shake-up has pushed
economic problems to second place. From the top leadership down,
officials and scholars have been preoccupied with implementing the
new political line and rooting out Western-style liberalism.
   But the Western economist said dwelling on party line is a
mistake.
   ``It is a time to worry about the economy,'' the economist said.
   A decade of unprecedented growth produced by senior leader Deng
Xiaoping's policy of reducing central planning has foundered in a
mire of raw material shortages, energy shortfalls, distribution
bottlenecks, wild spending, rising prices and stagnant productivity.
   Since September, the government has managed to cut inflation
from a high of about 36 percent to an annual rate of 25.5 percent
by reining in bank credit and reimposing control over some freed
prices.
   It halted thousands of construction projects and curbed the
growth of small collective-owned factories that were siphoning
materials and energy away from the state sector. It ordered
officials to stop buying cars and other perks and raised taxes on
imports.
   But the austerity measures have created new problems. Tens of
thousands of peasants who came to the cities on construction teams
have been sent home without alternative jobs, a policy some
economists criticized before the political crackdown.
   New price controls have contributed to an average 12 percent
drop in profits of state-owned enterprises, which employ
three-fourths of China's urban work force. Oil, coal and other
major industries are the worst hit, the People's Daily said.
China's infant auto industry is reeling under a state ban on new
car purchases by most government units.
   ``The financial situation is still quite serious,'' government
spokesman Yuan Mu acknowledged at a recent news conference.
   Agriculture appears to be one bright spot.
   The serious drought of the past two years has ended in most
areas and the summer grain harvest is up slightly from last year,
to 93 million tons. The government is predicting a record harvest
for the year of 410 million tons.
   Even this good news has a dark side. Most grain must be sold to
the state, and the better the harvest, the more cash the government
needs to buy it. In May, the Ministry of Commerce said it had only
half the $5.4 billion needed to buy the summer harvest.
   Since then, newspapers have reported that purchases are going
smoothly and have not said if the state has resorted to printing
more money as it did last year. The only alternative is to issue
IOUs.
   It did that last year, causing widespread discontent that the
government could do without now.

   Torrential rains and floods caused by Typhoon
Hope have killed at least 24 people and injured 1,000 in eastern
China, an official report said Saturday, just days after Typhoon
Gordon took at least 17 lives.
   The Xinhua News Agency said up to 7{ inches of rain fell in
various counties of Fujian province during the 24 hours beginning 8
a.m. Friday.
   Torrents rushed down mountains and several rivers flooded,
destroying 4,000 houses and covering 8,150 acres of cropland, the
report said.
   It said one person was missing.
   Typhoon Hope came ashore late Thursday in Zhejiang province,
just north of Fujian, but no deaths were reported there.
   Typhoon Gordon swept into southeastern China's Guangdong
province on Tuesday. It killed 17 people and injured more than 100,
while 13 were reported missing. Heavy damage also was done to
crops, bridges, highways and telecommunications.
   Gordon first hit land Sunday in the Philippines, where it killed
32 people. It killed on person in Hong Kong on Tuesday, officials
said.
   Flooding has killed a total of 1,400 people throughout China
since early June, according to official reports.

   A strong earthquake hit the Pacific Ocean
southeast of the Philippines on Saturday, but no injuries or damage
were reported, officials said.
   The quake registered 5.6 on the Richter scale, the Royal Hong
Kong Observatory reported. It placed the epicenter about 930 miles
southeast of Manila.
   A spokesman said the quake was recorded at 1:07 p.m. Hong Kong
time and that no other details were available.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
   Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10
times greater. A quake of magnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage
in a populated area.

   Bernard J. O'Keefe, who helped develop America's
first nuclear bomb and later spoke out against the dangers of
nuclear war, died at his home in Wayland. He was 69.
   O'Keefe joined EG&amp;G in Wellesley in 1947 and served as the
high-technology research and defense consulting company's chief
executive officer from 1965 to 1983. He was chairman of the board
from 1972 until 1985.
   O'Keefe went to Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico
during World War II to build the firing circuits for the weapons
that leveled Nagasaki and Hiroshima and received a presidential
citation for his efforts.
   In 1945, when O'Keefe was 25, he was sent to a Pacific island
for last-minute assembly of the Nagasaki bomb and discovered a
cable that had been installed backward. Repairing it meant
violating safety rules; a delay in the assembly could have
prolonged the war. O'Keefe jury-rigged the bomb.
   His company has participated in every nuclear explosion the
government has conducted, but O'Keefe spoke out against the nuclear
arms race in his books ``Nuclear Hostages'' and ``Shooting
Ourselves'' and took issue with the Reagan adminstration's nuclear
arms policy.
   O'Keefe, who died Thursday, was born in Providence, R.I. He
graduated from Catholic University of America in 1941 with a degree
in electrical engineering. He attended graduate school at Bowdoin
College and advanced radar school at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   In addition to his roles at EG&amp;G, O'Keefe served as director of
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., Dennison Manufacturing Co.,
Boston Edison and Kurzweil Music Systems and was a director of the
Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce.
   He leaves his wife, Teri, three daughters, a son and a sister.

<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government's Export-Import Bank
reported Saturday that it reduced both its losses and the U.S.
exports it supported in the year that ended last Sept. 30.
   The annual report included renewed criticism from Comptroller
General Charles A. Bowsher, head of the congressional General
Accounting Office. He said the bank has failed to make any
allowance for what his office considers the uncollectible portion
of $11.6 billion owed to it. The statement, dated April 9, did not
say how much was considered uncollectible.
   Bowsher's staff has cited old loans counted by the bank as
assets even though they have been repudiated by China and the
government of President Fidel Castro in Cuba.
   ``The bank is extremely cautious about writing off loans and
guarantees to government(s)... because we believe these sovereign
risk loans and guarantees will be repaid,'' said a statement in the
report by Acting President William F. Ryan and James K. Hess, the
bank's treasurer.
   Bowsher wrote that because of its continued losses, the bank's
reserve was in deficit for the first time ever. The bank put that
deficit at $116.4 million.
   A separate report by the bank on its international
competitiveness said American business people judged it ``generally
less than competitive'' in competing with other industrial
governments in making loans repayable in over five years. It was
seen as basically competitive for shorter term loans.
   It supported long-term credit for about $710 million worth of
business in 1988, compared with $5.37 billion worth supported by
France, $1.77 billion by Italy, $1.13 billion by West Germany and
$730 million by Britain.
   The bank's major job in recent years has been to encourage sales
of American industrial goods by helping foreign buyers borrow the
money needed to purchase them. It makes direct loans itself, and
guarantees loans by commercial banks so they can offer lower
interest. Other governments have similar agencies for supporting
their exports.
   It supported $6.535 billion worth of sales in 1988, compared
with $9.265 billion worth the year before. It cut its net loss to
$428.2 million from the previous year's $460.9 million. It has been
losing money through the 1980s.
   ``The losses in recent years stem mainly from long-term loans
made to foreign borrowers in the latter 1970s and early 1980s at
interest rates significantly below the bank's cost of funds in
order to help U.S. exporters meet foreign competition,'' Ryan said
in the annual report.
   ``That subsidy will ultimately amount to about 1 percent of
total exports supported _ not a very heavy price for the American
job growth and industrial competitiveness those exports achieved.''

<HEAD>Fraternal Group to Vote Nationally on Allowing Female Members</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The national Elks organization will
consider this week whether to welcome women into the all-male
preserve, but the proposal's sponsor says he wasn't motivated by a
desire for equality between the sexes.
   Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Hal Detrick says his resolution,
approved by the Jonesboro lodge, was prompted instead by the
fraternal organization's declining membership and the resignation
from the local chapter of a federal judicial nominee under Senate
scrutiny.
   ``I could see then that any young lawyer or young aspiring
politician who might aspire to be anything within the federal
government might be reluctant to become a member of the Elks, and
we do too much good work to make it an albatross around any young
person's neck,'' Detrick, 67, said last week during an interview.
   The resolution is to be submitted Thursday at the 125th national
convention of the 1.5 million-member Benevolent and Protective
Order of the Elks in New Orleans. It would delete the word ``male''
from the group's national membership requirements, which specify
``a male citizen of the United States of America.''
   Did Detrick's proposal, approved by the Jonesboro chapter by a
two-thirds vote in March, arouse emotion?
   ``Passion? No. Words? Yes,'' Detrick said. ``The first person
who talked to me said, `Hal, what are you trying to do?' And I
explained exactly what I was trying to do.''
   In St. George, Utah, a woman who was rejected for Elks
membership filed in 1987 a sex discrimination lawsuit, which still
is pending. And while the Elks do have some black members
nationally, several California lodges threatened legal action if
rules were not changed to allow more minority representation in the
group's 2,300 lodges.
   No woman has tried to join the 90-year-old Jonesboro
organization, which also has no black members, said Jonesboro
Exalted Ruler Clyde Harcrow, 56, the equivalent of local president.
   Candidates must be nominated by a member and undergo background
checks and interviews, with questions that might include whether
the nominees use illegal drugs or believe in the U.S. Constitution
and God, Harcrow said.
   Votes on prospective members are by secret ballot.
   Detrick's resolution says Elks membership policies were subject
to ``undeserved criticism'' during the February 1988 confirmation
hearings for Stephen M. Reasoner of Jonesboro, now a federal judge.
   Reasoner's memberships in the Jonesboro Elks and Masonic lodges
were criticized by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who accused the
organizations of discriminating against women and blacks.
   In a letter to Metzenbaum disclosing his resignation from both
groups, Reasoner wrote: ``I want to reiterate that I do not do this
out of a belief that these organizations are racially
discriminatory.''
   But, he said, it was preferable to resign ``to remove this
issue'' from consideration of his nomination.
   Detrick's resolution also says that ``a member of this state's
congressional delegation has shown reluctance to risk unfavorable
publicity if he should pursue membership in this lodge.''
   Detrick would not identify the congressman. Jonesboro is
represented by Democrat Bill Alexander, who said through a
spokesman that he is not a member of the Elks and did not recall
seeking membership.
   The 1,300 members of the Jonesboro Elks _ down from about 2,000
a decade ago _ provide scholarships each year to several Arkansas
State University students, raise money for a state-run center
serving developmentally disabled children, foot the bill for a
hot-lunch program for senior citizens, and deliver birthday cakes
to nursing homes, Harcrow said.
   Harcrow said he will vote for Detrick's resolution at the
national convention because a majority of his members favored it.
   Neither Harcrow nor Detrick would predict whether it would pass,
but Detrick said it might be difficult to persuade members to
change the rules.
   ``When it comes time to vote for or against this, it's a secret
ballot, just like when we vote on a prospective member,'' Detrick
said.
   ``Several members since I made the proposal have said, `Hey,
it's coming sooner or later. We might as well do it now.' And it's
better to do it rather than be forced to do it.''

<TEXT>
   Beijing's suppression of its pro-democracy
movement has derailed China's opening to the West and prompted
speculation its economy could enter a new period of stagnation,
including foreign exchange shortages and limited contacts between
Chinese and foreign businesses.
   Hong Kong newspapers are filled with reports about postponed
projects, some involving hundreds of millions of dollars, since the
government crushed the pro-democracy movement early last month.
   The World Bank has halted consideration of about $230 million in
loans, and the Asian Development Bank has delayed decisions on
about $1 billion. Japan also has expressed concern over its plan to
lend China $5.6 billion.
   ``In terms of investment, China is basically dead,'' said a
Western diplomat. ``In terms of trade, they aren't dead yet, but
they're dying. It's a sad story, but they did it to themselves.''
   Businessmen and diplomats interviewed in Hong Kong say China's
economic modernization plan has stalled, despite statements to the
contrary by Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin.
   They point to recent editorials in the Chinese press criticizing
private industry, the most active sector of the economy, and to
claims that Chinese operators of joint ventures have been told to
limit contact with foreigners.
   ``No one will talk to me on the mainland anymore,'' said an
American business consultant, who spent three years in China before
moving to Hong Kong.
   ``It's back to the days of `Spy vs. Spy,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Businessmen and diplomats also criticize Beijing's campaign
against official corruption, a major impediment to doing business
in China, as a cosmetic gesture after the Chinese military
crackdown left hundreds of people dead.
   Foreign traders say they will take a much more cautious approach
toward China.
   John Hu, who runs an import-export company in Hong Kong, sold $4
million in cigarette filters and television picture tubes to China
about two weeks ago.
   Before, he would have signed bigger, longer-term contracts.
   ``I'm doing business on a case-by-case basis,'' he said. ``I say
to them, `If you guys don't have the foreign exchange, you're not
going to see the material.'''
   Western diplomats predict that China's current foreign exchange
reserves of $17 billion could be gone by next year, especially if
its appetite for foreign goods continues. In the first five months
of 1989, imports jumped 25 percent while exports increased only 5
percent.
   Observers say there are some opportunities for the short-term.
   Commodities traders say recent business has been brisk as China
moves to make up for the predicted drop in investment by selling
some products cut rate.
   An official from a large Japanese company in Hong Kong said
Chinese have signed several multimillion-dollar contracts in recent
weeks in an attempt to purchase goods before the foreign exchange
crunch begins. And on Monday, China signed a contract with an
American firm giving it the right to lease Chinese land to foreign
investors.
   But analysts said these opportunities appear to be short-lived.
   ``The good deals will only last as long as China's foreign
exchange holds out, which won't be that long,'' said Robert
Broadfoot, a Hong Kong-based business analyst. ``The deal makers
involved in the bigger projects, like investments, are taking a
very big risk.''
   Broadfoot said many of his clients are canceling investment
projects or putting plans on hold.
   ``Those people who were just getting interested in China are
backing out,'' Broadfoot said. ``For those who are already in
there, they have no choice but to protect what they've got.''
   The stakes are high.
   According to Chinese figures, China in 1988 did about $80
billion of trade, a rise of 16.6 percent from 1987.
   The crackdown on the pro-democracy demonstrators also has handed
China's fledgling legal system a major defeat. Legal experts said
the shooting of unarmed citizens in Beijing made a mockery of law.
   ``By blatantly distorting facts and manipulating law and legal
institutions, they have devalued the currency of not only their
country's domestic legislation but also its international
agreements,'' international lawyer Jerome Cohen wrote in a recent
essay.
   ``In the eyes of foreign individuals, companies and governments,
all these actions make China a riskier place, a less trustworthy
partner,'' he added.
   Before the crackdown, signs of change had emerged in China's
legal sphere.
   Cohen cited a case early this year involving several Chinese
firms that were raided and fined for assembling copycat IBM
products.
   An IBM spokesman had said the action had encouraged the company
to invest in China. But since the crackdown, IBM has cut its
foreign staff in Beijing by approximately 40 percent, said a
company source.

   Education officials said Saturday
they suspended an assistant high school teacher accused of
punishing 400 students by flogging them with a cane.
   The teacher at a boys' high school in Kuantan, about 150 miles
from Kuala Lumpur, caned the boys from three separate grades on
Monday, according to an unidentified student quoted by the state
news agency Bernama.
   He said the boys were not told what they had done wrong.
   Abdul Rahman Arshad, director-general of education, said the
government expected a report on the incident within a week. He said
the teacher, who was not identified, has been suspended.
   An unidentified staff member at the school told Bernama there
had been problems with discipline at the school. He said students
had been showing disrespect to teachers and neglecting to keep the
school tidy.
   Under Malaysian education laws, only male schoolchildren may be
caned.

<HEAD>Report: Pakistan Can Outfit U.S. Jets With Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan has developed technology
to outfit U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets with nuclear weapons, a
report said Saturday.
   Der Spiegel magazine, quoting unidentified West German
intelligence officials, said Pakistan developed sophisticated
computer and electronic technology to make it possible for its
F-16s to carry nuclear bombs.
   Spiegel, which is based in Hamburg, said that since Pakistan
developed the technology, Washington has approved the delivery of
60 new F-16s to Pakistan. According to Spiegel, the planes
delivered to Pakistan did not contain the electronic components
needed to allow the jets to carry nuclear payloads. But the
magazine said Pakistan has since been able to develop the systems
itself.
   Pakistan has denied widespread reports it has nuclear weapons.
Its prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, offered to open Pakistan's
nuclear facilities to international inspection but only if its
traditional rival, India, does the same. India's prime minister,
Rajiv Gandhi, has refused to do so.
   Spiegel also quoted unidentified sources in Bonn as saying that
the government is upset about Washington's sale of F-16s to
Pakistan because U.S. officials have criticized similar West German
exports to other countries.
   ``They put us in the accused dock, while they go ahead and do
business,'' Spiegel quoted a government official as saying.
   A summary of Spiegel's report, which will appear in its Monday
edition, was telexed to other news media in advance.
   West Germany's export laws have been under intense criticism for
loopholes that have allegedly allowed shipments of sensitive
materials to countries with purported plans to use them for
military purposes.
   The biggest scandal occurred late last year after U.S.
allegations that West German firms were linked to a chemical
weapons production facility in Libya.
   West Germany first insisted there was no proof of the American
claims. But later, West Germany launched its own criminal
investigation that resulted in the arrest of the head of a chemical
firm on suspicion of violating export laws.

   Any outsider thinking about running for
Congress better plan on spending more than a quarter of a million
dollars or forget about it, according to a campaign finance study
released Saturday.
   Even then, a challenger would face long odds and probably still
could not raise more money than an incumbent, said the study of the
1988 elections by the Center for Responsive Politics.
   ``House challengers who spent between $250,000 and $500,000
found the odds against them to be 11-to-1 on election day,'' said
Larry Makinson, the author of the study. ``Even those who spent
more than half a million dollars had only one chance in six of
winning.''
   He added that ``those who spent less than $250,000 had a perfect
record: They all lost.''
   In the Senate, the average election last year cost $3 million,
according to the study.
   Last year, 98 percent of the House members running for
re-election won, while in the Senate, 85 percent of the incumbents
running were successful.
   The study is based largely on computerized financial information
compiled by the Federal Election Commission, but it also compares
that data with voting statistics and historical material.
   Even if a challenger did manage to raise a lot of money, the
incumbent would just raise more.
   In House races where the challenger spent $100,000 to $250,000,
the incumbent spent an average of $520,255. If the challenger spent
more than $500,000, the incumbent spent an average of $904,704,
according to the study.
   Still, having deep pockets is no guarantee of a seat in the
House. Of the 10 biggest-spending challengers, only one, New York
Democrat Nita Lowey, won an election, and she spent more than $1.3
million.
   The average financial lead of incumbents over challengers has
widened over the last few years, from $172,002 in 1986 to $264,104
last year. In 1974, the gap was just $16,532, and in relative
terms, the challengers have been losing ground, the study said.
   ``I think the reason is people are seeing it is a very bad
investment for half a million dollars,'' Makinson said.
   The Center for Responsive Politics is non-partisan group, funded
by private foundations, that does research on congressional and
political trends.

<HEAD>Party Boss of Kiev Who Lost Election Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party boss of Kiev resigned
Saturday, four months after failing to win a seat in the new Soviet
legislature, the official Tass news agency reported.
   The resignation of Konstantin I. Masik followed a warning by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday that inefficient
officials would be replaced.
   Masik was relieved as first secretary of the Kiev Communist
Party Committee ``at his own request,'' Tass said. It said he was
transferred to another position, but it did not identify Masik's
new job.
   He was replaced by A.I. Kornienko, formerly deputy head of the
city's construction and personnel department, Tass said.
   Kiev's mayor, V. Zgurski, also lost in the March 26 elections
for seats on the Congress of People's Deputies.
   Masik is the second party boss of a major city to be replaced
after losing in the elections.
   On July 12, Yuri F. Solovyov, the party boss of Leningrad and a
candidate member of the ruling Politburo, was ousted as first
secretary of the country's second-largest city.
   Gorbachev said at the time that the retirement of Solovyov was a
critical step in ``developing the process of democratization of the
internal life of the entire party.''
   In a speech to high-ranking officials of the Communist Party
Central Committee on Tuesday, Gorbachev said some party officials
had taken a ``passive, waiting position'' and longed for a return
to ``good times'' to avoid making the difficult decisions required
to improve the country. These officials _ including some of those
at the very top in the Politburo _ must be replaced, he said,
without naming names.
   Gorbachev said these officials should have expected rough times
when they initially supported perestroika, or economic and social
restructuring, because they knew it would be a revolution and ``a
revolutionary time is not a comfortable situation.''

<HEAD>New Solicitor General Tired of Speculation About Getting Court Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kenneth W. Starr is looking forward to his
first Supreme Court argument as the federal government's
top-ranking courtroom lawyer, but he is weary of speculation that
his role in such sessions might someday be as a high court member.
   Willing to discuss _ in cautious terms _ such politically
sensitive issues as abortion and flag-burning in a recent interview
with The Associated Press, Starr drew the line at talking about a
Supreme Court nomination.
   ``I'm not going to comment at all on anything with respect to
the future. My job is right here, and I'm terribly occupied with
the here and now,'' said the former federal appellate judge who two
months ago became the Bush administration's solicitor general.
   During Senate confirmation hearings earlier this year, Starr was
asked why he would leave his appeals court seat, with its lifetime
tenure, for a job that could last just four years. He said the
Justice Department job was ``a great privilege'' he could not turn
down.
   When Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., inquired whether a possible
Supreme Court nomination had been discussed, Starr said it had not.
There was ``no arrangement, no understanding of any kind whatsoever
and, indeed, no discussion of any such matter,'' Starr testified.
   But a judge's life clearly appeals to Starr, 43. ``I very much
enjoyed being a judge,'' he told The Associated Press of his five
years on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington. ``I was
immensely professionally satisfied with being a judge.''
   But as solicitor general Starr is a player, not a referee, eager
for the contest.
   His first Supreme Court appearance will come next fall in a case
growing out of efforts to racially desegregate Yonkers, N.Y.
   Four Yonkers city councilmen are seeking to overturn fines
imposed against them for initially defying a federal judge's order
to adopt a housing desegregation plan. The city had been sued by
the federal government.
   Starr will argue that the judge did not exceed his authority in
assessing the fines.
   ``It's a very important case which raises quite fundamental
issues,'' Starr said. ``There are certain cases that lend
themselves to being argued by the solicitor general personally.
This struck me as one in that category.''
   The fact that Starr will argue on the side supported by civil
rights activists is in stark contrast to several of the
high-profile cases argued by his predecessor, Charles Fried,
criticized by those who said he was too willing to mix litigation
with conservative politics.
   In Supreme Court appearances as solicitor general in the
administration of former President Reagan, Fried vigorously opposed
broad use of affirmative action and expansive interpretation of
civil rights law.
   Starr said he has ``the highest respect and affection for
Charles,'' and added, ``I'm not going to comment on aspects of
practice when I was not here.''
   While noting it is appropriate for White House officials to
contact him and his staff about Supreme Court cases in which
President Bush is interested, Starr said, ``I think every solicitor
general has to be prepared to follow the dictates of his
conscience, informed by his professional judgment.
   ``If he cannot in conscience subscribe to a particular legal
position, he is duty bound as an officer of the court ... not to
advance it,'' Starr said.
   Will the Bush administration seek to participate in the three
abortion rights cases to be argued before the Supreme Court when
its new term begins in October?
   ``That is uncertain,'' Starr said, adding that the final
determination will be made by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
``This is a unique case of obvious importance.''
   Starr refused to say whether he agrees with Thornburgh's support
for a constitutional amendment to overcome the Supreme Court's June
decision that burning the American flag is a constitutionally
protected form of political protest.
   ``I'm going to stay completely out of it. That is now in the
political arena,'' Starr said.
   Asked about his first reaction to the court's decision, Starr
said, ``It was not a surprise to me that the court would conclude
that this was symbolic speech protected under the First Amendment.
That was not a surprise.''
   A Justice Department priority under former Attorney General
Edward Meese III had been finding the appropriate case in which to
ask the Supreme Court to overturn its 1966 decision in Miranda vs.
Arizona.
   In it, the court required police to warn criminal suspects of
their right to remain silent and to have a lawyer's help before
answering any questions.
   Overturning the Miranda ruling is not a Bush administration
priority, Starr indicated.
   ``If, in fact, the law enforcement apparatus of the federal
government felt that any issue was one of concern and vexation to
them, that's something that would have to be weighed and analyzed
at that time. I simply am aware of no sense in the administration
of a call to overrule'' the Miranda decision.

<TEXT>
   Looking back, it's easy to spot the little ironies. Garry Priest
had called his mother to tell her he loved her. Bill Entrup had
been turned away because the plane was overbooked.
   ``Garry never does that,'' Jeri Priest thought later, when she
heard the news about Flight 232. Bill Entrup had thought, ``Wait a
minute. That's my ticket.''
   But earlier Wednesday, when the DC-10 had thundered down the
runway at Stapleton International Airport and lifted into the clear
Denver sky, there was no reason to think twice about those things.
At that point, United Flight 232 was just another two-hour hop to
Chicago.
   Priest, a 23-year-old communications specialist for a Denver
restaurant chain, was going to Chicago on business. Mark Gearhart,
a Colorado veterinarian, was heading to Ohio for his 15th high
school reunion. Ruth Gomez of Bloomfield, N.M., was taking her
three children to visit their grandfather in Maine.
   Altogether, there were 285 or 286 passengers _ the precise
number remains in dispute _ and 11 crew members on board.
Miraculously, 186 people survived when Flight 232 ended in flames
in an Iowa cornfield. Tragically, at least 110 people died.
   Garry Priest lived; Mark Gearhart died. Paul and Leah Gomez
lived; their mother, Ruth, and brother John died.
   Experts can offer explanations for why some lived and some died.
Basically, it comes down to seat location and blind luck. But it's
doubtful that will ever mean much to Garry Priest or Paul and Leah
Gomez.
   The trouble started at 3:16 p.m. CDT.
   The flight was about 1{ hours out of Denver. Some of the
passengers were watching a sports videotape on the plane's movie
screens; others were talking, reading, sleeping.
   Suddenly there was an explosion from the rear of the plane that
knocked the flight attendants to the floor. And then, recalled
David Landsberger, a businessman from Caldwell, N.J., ``We were
going down.''
   Jerome Milford, an Indianapolis accountant returning from a
Colorado vacation, said it was ``like going on an elevator and
going down too fast. We were losing altitude, and they told us
they'd lost an engine.''
   In the cockpit, Capt. Al C. Haynes, who flew in the Korean War
and had been a United pilot for 33 years, was telling air traffic
controllers in Minneapolis that the jet had lost an engine and was
losing altitude. One minute later, he reported a ``complete
hydraulic failure'' of the jet's steering system; the Minneapolis
tower told him to take the plane to Dubuque, Iowa.
   The Federal Aviation Administration later discovered that a fan
was missing from the tail engine; it apparently had exploded,
slicing through the hydraulic steering system.
   At 3:20, Haynes declared an emergency and the flight was
rerouted to Sioux City, Iowa. Haynes told passengers that the plane
had lost an engine and would be late.
   At 3:30, some field workers were returning from a coffee break
at Alta, Iowa, 60 miles east of Sioux City, when they discovered an
8-foot by 12-foot section of the plane in a soybean-and-corn field.
They notified local authorities.
   Ten minutes after that, Haynes got on the plane's public address
system again and announced that the jet's tail section was damaged.
The flight would make an emergency landing in Sioux City, he said.
   ``He sounded a little stressed,'' Landsberger recalled. Some
passengers were beginning to get hysterical, although most remained
calm.
   ``At one point,'' recalled Jerome Milford, ``a co-pilot came
back and looked out over the wing of the plane, and he was very
concerned also. We were hoping it would just be a soft landing and
that we would walk away and think nothing of it. But that wasn't
the case.''
   Passenger Ron Rhode of Marysville, Ohio, noticed that an
8-year-old boy, Ben Radtke of Prairie View, Ill., was traveling
alone. Rhode moved to the seat next to him.
   In the cockpit, the crew was becoming desperate. ``If you've got
any ideas, we could use them,'' one crew member told ground
controllers. A pilot in another plane heard this message over his
radio: ``We need an airport, an interstate, a gravel road, a field.
We're coming down someplace.''
   As they approached Sioux City, Landsberger said, ``The plane was
rocking from side to side.'' Haynes was trying to steer the jet by
controlling the speed of his remaining wing-mounted engines. Flight
attendants told passengers to read the emergency instructions in
the seat pocket in front of them, and ran them through a practice
drill.
   ``They told us to keep our seatbelts fastened tightly and to put
our heads between our legs. About four minutes before we crashed,
they told us to brace ourselves,'' Landsberger said.
   As the plane approached for a landing at Sioux Gateway Airport,
Haynes repeated the order: ``Brace, brace, brace.''
   ``We really thought we were going to make it,'' passenger Debbie
Belliveau said.
   At 3:58, the plane skimmed toward the runway, pitched violently
to its right, scraped its right wing and cartwheeled across the
runway, exploding into flames. It landed in a cornfield, shattered
in pieces.
   ``I was peeking, if you will, and I saw us hit,'' said passenger
Charlie Martz, a private pilot from Castle Rock, Colo. ``I closed
my eyes and hoped, with a pillow over my head.
   ``We rolled upside down, and inside out and every which way. The
plane broke into three pieces, and bodies all over the place,
hanging upside down.
   ``I unfastened my belt and dropped a little ways. ... Finally I
saw what I thought was an open window, but there were flames. I
said, `To hell with it, I'm going for it' and I went through the
flames. I can't believe it, there were people with feet missing and
arms missing, it's the goddamndest thing I've ever seen in my
life.''
   Ron Rhode and another passenger, Danny Surge of Chicago, were
with young Bed Radtke. The plane ``hit and bounced, then flipped
and spun around so we ended up upside down,'' Rhode said. ``I let
go and asked Dan for the kid.''
   Surge handed Ben to Rhode, who shoved him out the plane.
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' Ben said later, still
clutching a United Airlines button and a pair of plastic pilot's
wings.
   Landsberger said that after the plane stopped sliding, ``We just
all walked out into a cornfield. I was a little dazed. I do know
that I probably stepped on some people or something as we were
walking out, but I knew if we stopped we'd all get bottled up.''
   Seven-year-old Paul Gomez had been sitting with his 10-year-old
brother, John, his 4-year-old sister, Leah, and his 35-year-old
mother, Ruth.
   After the crash, as he and Leah fled the burning plane, Paul
said he heard his brother yelling that he was stuck.
   ``Nobody would help him,'' Paul said. ``Mom tried.''
   She and John Gomez were listed among the unconfirmed dead.
   When Garry Priest stepped out of the wreckage, he said, the
runway looked ``like a war zone. Bodies, trash, magazines, luggage
and pieces of bodies littered the area. It was the worst thing I've
ever seen.''
   But the evacuation was ``real organized,'' he said. ``Everybody
was just saying, `OK folks, let's take our time. Let's just walk
out,' and we did.''
   People on the ground couldn't believe their eyes. Nobody could
walk away from a crash like that, nobody. But there they were,
bruised and burned and amazed as anybody that they could be alive.
They will always wonder why.

<HEAD>Doubts Deepen Over Lucas Nomination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William C. Lucas, the Bush administration's
embattled nominee for chief civil rights enforcer, came up with a
novel reply last week when senators asked him his views on recent
Supreme Court rulings.
   ``I'm new to the law,'' said the 61-year-old former sheriff,
drawing a gasp from onlookers and sending the nomination deeper
into doubt. Within a day, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., withdrew his
support, and two senators who had been leaning toward Lucas turned
noticeably cool.
   Lucas' performance at his confirmation hearing provided new
ammunition for civil rights groups who claim he lacks the
experience to head the 151-lawyer civil rights division of the
Justice Department.
   It also dampened prospects for confirmation if the Lucas
candidacy reaches the Senate floor, perhaps after lawmakers return
from their August recess.
   Thus far Republicans are scoffing at any talk of withdrawing the
nomination, and civil rights forces are preparing for a full-scale
showdown in the Senate Judiciary Committee, perhaps as early as
Thursday.
   ``This is the most important civil rights vote that senators
will have this year,'' said William Taylor of the Citizens
Commission on Civil Rights.
   President Bush would suffer a painful embarrassment if the
Senate rejected Lucas, a black and former Democrat who in 1986
switched parties to run an unsuccessful race for governor of
Michigan as a Republican.
   Republicans expect to move the nomination out of the Judiciary
Committee, where it has been marooned for months. Republicans,
outnumbered 8-6 on the committee, may need to capture two of
perhaps three wavering votes if they are to win a favorable
recommendation from the panel for Lucas.
   If the committee balks at giving a favorable recommendation,
there are other routes to the Senate floor, but the nomination
would arrive there under a cloud. And Lucas critics say they have
stronger backing on the floor than in the committee.
   ``The nomination is in trouble,'' says Ralph Neas, executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   ``We have a week to work,'' said Patrick McGuigan of the
conservative Free Congress Foundation as Lucas supporters sought to
bring pressure on senators believed to be wavering. By most counts
they were Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Howell Heflin, D-Ala.;
and Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
   ``He needs to get two of them and if he loses two then he is
still in trouble,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. Simon said that
after the confirmation hearing he was inclined to oppose the
nominee because of lukewarm testimony on civil rights issues.
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., expressed the
same sentiments, saying he was disappointed that Lucas had not
demonstrated more enthusiasm for the civil rights cause.
   DeConcini said Lucas could have helped his own cause if he had
``couched it a little better'' when he backed the Bush
administration's position that there is no reason to be upset over
recent court rulings on job discrimination, minority set asides and
other civil rights concerns.
   But he said it was unreasonable to expect the nominee to attack
the president and his prospective boss, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh. DeConcini did stop just short of expressing full
support.
   ``When I started out these hearings I was in favor of Lucas and
I am still, but I'm going to review the record in full before I
make an absolute decision,'' DeConcini said in an interview Friday.
Heflin sent word through an aide that he remained undecided.
   Civil rights groups complained that Lucas had never taken part
in a trial, filed a brief or handled an appeal. ``It's like me
having a medical degree but never practicing medicine and being
named to head a team of brain surgeons,'' said Elaine Jones of the
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
   Lucas supporters scoff at such complaints and predict they will
prevail on the Judiciary panel. ``I think there are enough
Democrats who realize this is a very fine man who has a good
reputation who has done a good job in every job he has held and who
deserves this responsibility,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   But Justice Department lobbyists rushed to Conyers' office with
Lucas in tow Thursday morning after the black lawmaker threatened
to withdraw his support unless the nominee were willing to recant
his Wednesday testimony.
   Conyers had been drafted to stand in for Michigan's two
senators, Democrats Don Riegle and Carl Levin, after they refused
the customary courtesy of introducing Lucas to the Judiciary
Committee. They said such an action might be mistaken for an
endorsement.

<TEXT>
   George Bush lamented in his inaugural address
last January that the United States had ``more will than wallet,''
a fact that was clearly evident at the president's first economic
summit.
   Bush went to the annual gathering of the world's seven largest
industrial democracies last week with a bag full of ideas on
reducing Third World debt, promoting democracy in Poland and
Hungary and cleaning up global pollution.
   But he carried little in hard cash to back up the initiatives.
He proposed no new money for the pollution cleanup, conceded that
the United States was dependent on others to back his Third World
debt plan and offered what some thought was an embarrassingly small
$125 million package of assistance to Hungary and Poland.
   Despite the slim wallet, however, Bush managed to a significant
degree to control the agenda of the meeting with the leaders of
France, Britain, Japan, West Germany, Italy and Canada.
   That was quite a feat for a nation that is now the world's
largest debtor country, a nation that must depend on $10 billion in
investment from the rest of the world each month to finance its
huge budget and trade deficits.
   The final communique issued at the end of the three-day
gathering mirrored to a great extent the goals that the
administration had set coming into the meeting:
   _On Third World debt, the seven summit nations gave their
blessing to the debt forgiveness plan first unveiled on March 10 by
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. Japan even announced that it was
putting up more money to support the proposal, boosting its
financial backing to $5.5 billion. The administration was
disappointed that negotiations between Mexico and its creditor
banks, taking place in New York, were not completed by the time the
summit ended, but officials say they believe those talks soon will
provide the first success story for the Brady initiative.
   _On global pollution, the summit, as Bush had hoped, made the
environment a top priority for the first time since these
gatherings began 15 years ago. The final communique called for an
acceleration in preparations for an international convention
designed to draw up guidelines for dealing with the threat of
global warming and also addressed such issues as depletion of the
ozone layer, ocean pollution and loss of forest land.
   _On East-West relations, Bush scored his biggest triumph. He
managed to seize the initiative in this area through his
history-making trip to Poland and Hungary immediately before the
start of the summit. The other summit countries, many of whom had
earlier announced their own efforts to foster economic reforms in
Communist Eastern Europe, endorsed U.S. proposals to advance these
efforts. The final communique, however, did not contain any
specifics on how much money the nations would be willing to put up.
   Despite its success in Paris, the administration is facing
questions about America's current financial predicament and what it
means for the country's long-run position on the world stage.
   ``Because of the tight fiscal constraints, we are not in a
position to put a lot of resources to deal with (global) economic
problems,'' Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress, said during a review of the Paris
summit.
   ``It seems to me the baton is passing to other nations better
able to provide financing than we are,'' Hamilton told Brady.
   Brady conceded that the inability of the United States to put up
resources to back its global initiatives was a ``serious worry''
but he said the Paris summit demonstrated that the Western leaders
had the will to work together to solve common problems.
   Some observors, however, believe the Paris summit may mark the
beginning of a transition to a new world order in which the United
States is now first among equals with the other summit countries.
   C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International
Economics, a Washington think-tank, gave Bush high marks for being
able to push U.S. initiatives in Paris while at the same time
urging other countries to foot the bill.
   Bergsten said the key test will come in whether the United
States is willing to share decision-making on international issues
as it seeks funding help from other countries.
   ``The Paris summit could mark the first early step away from a
U.S.-led world to a ... world where the United States puts up the
ideas and looks to others to put up the money,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A 1987 state constitutional amendment
broadening the right to bear arms means that even convicted felons
may own guns, a judge ruled.
   Cumberland County Superior Court Justice Stephen L. Perkins on
Friday dismissed a charge of possession of a firearm by a felon
against Edward Brown of Cumberland.
   Prosecutors had argued that the amendment's backers did not
intend to allow felons to own guns, but the judge said nothing in
the amendment indicated such an intent.
   ``If Maine legislators and citizens wanted to restrict or
qualify the right to keep and bear arms, they could have enacted a
constitutional provision that contained the desired restrictions,''
Perkins wrote.
   ``Maine's right to keep and bear arms amendment is the most
broad and least restrictive of any of the 43 similar state
amendments,'' he wrote.
   Attorney General James E. Tierney said Saturday that the case
would be appealed, adding, ``With all due respect to Justice
Perkins, we think he is wrong.''
   The Maine constitution used to guaranteed the right to keep and
bear arms ``for the common defense.''
   In 1986, the Maine Supreme Court upheld a gun violation by
focusing on the ``common defense'' phrase. In response, the
Legislature enacted a constitutional amendment deleting that
language, and voters approved it in November 1987.
   The amendment declared, ``Every citizen has a right to keep and
bear arms,and this right shall never be questioned.''
   Brown had been accused of criminal threatening in 1988, as well
as with illegal possession of a gun. He previously had been
convicted under the state's habitual offender law for operating a
motor vehicle after his driver's license had been revoked.
   Perkins denied a motion to dismiss the criminal threatening
charge, but threw out the gun possession charge, saying ``there is
simply no rational connection'' between Brown's previous conviction
and his ownership of a firearm.

<HEAD>Leader of Governing Party Says ANC Should Emulate Mandela</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAHM VENTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOMERSET WEST, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the governing
National Party said Saturday the African National Congress should
``follow the lead'' of Nelson Mandela by committing itself to a
peaceful settlement in South Africa.
   F.W. de Klerk, expected to succeed P.W. Botha as president after
elections in September, told a party congress he had supported the
planning of the meeting this month between Botha and Mandela, the
ANC leader who has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life
term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.
   The meeting, at Botha's residence in Cape Town, ``was in the
best interest of South Africa,'' de Klerk said. He made no direct
reference to the possibility of Mandela's release but implied that
the ANC leader was now considered by the government to be a
potential voice of reconciliation.
   Few details of the surprise Mandela-Botha meeting have been
disclosed beyond a statement from Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee,
who was present and said both leaders confirmed ``their support for
peaceful development'' in South Africa.
   Mandela later issued his own statement confirming the accuracy
of Coetsee's comment but emphasizing that no peaceful solution
could be found unless the government negotiated with the ANC and
its allied groups in South Africa.
   The ANC, the largest guerrilla group fighting the government, is
illegal in South Africa.
   De Klerk, in his speech to 500 National Party delegates from
Cape Province, appeared to be trying to drive a wedge between
Mandela and the ANC, which has waged a bombing and sabotage
campaign in South Africa since 1961.
   ``As a result of its relationship with Mr. Mandela, the ANC
cannot escape addressing the issue at stake: is it prepared to
follow the lead given by him and to commit itself to the pursuit of
peaceful solutions?'' de Klerk asked.
   ``The ball is now squarely in the ANC's court and not, as some
would have it, in the government's.''
   If the ANC wants to engage in dialogue, it should abandon
``violence and terrorism,'' said de Klerk, adding, ``We are not
afraid to talk to people who differ from us.''
   The National Party wants to talk to ``recognized leaders'' of
all factions, de Klerk said. ``Scientific surveys prove beyond
doubt that the support of the ANC is absolutely overrated in many
quarters.''
   De Klerk reiterated his vision of a ``new South Africa'' in
which the disenfranchised black majority would have a formal voice
in national politics but would not be able to impose its will on
the white minority.
   Earlier in the day, Botha and his wife, Elize, made an
appearance at the congress. The outgoing president received several
standing ovations and was honored by a motion praising him as ``one
of South Africa's greatest sons.''
   ``I am a happy man because I live in a country of hope, a
country of the future,'' said Botha, 73. ``All I ask is when we
make the choices when we build the future, let's hold each other
together with loyalty.''

<HEAD>Soviet Jew Denied Exit Because Of 25-Year-Old `State Secrets'</HEAD>

   Judith Lurie, her husband and two children had
finally received permission to leave the Soviet Union. Emmanuel
Lurie quit his job, the children were taken out of school, the
airplane tickets were purchased.
   Five days before their scheduled departure, the exit visas were
revoked. The family was told the permits would be re-issued soon.
That was 10 years ago, and the Luries are still waiting.
   Soviet authorities say Emmanuel Lurie cannot leave because he
knows secrets from the two-year period he worked as a young organic
chemistry researcher in a government facility 27 years ago.
   ``He had access to classified information, but he had just
graduated from university and had a junior job. And science has
changed so much since then, what damage can he do?'' asked Judith
Lurie, who used a tourist visa to travel to the halls of the State
Department and Congress to plead her husband's case this past week.
   The Luries are at the top of the State Department's list of
Soviet citizens denied permission to emigrate because of their
alleged knowledge of state secrets. But in the public eye, their
plight has been all but obscured by the unprecedented flood of
Jews, Pentacostalists and Armenians flowing out of Mikhail
Gorbachev's Soviet Union, with its liberalized political and
economic policies.
   ``The world is enchanted by words like `glasnost' and
`perestroika,' but people like us continue to live with the horror,
and we feel abandoned,'' said Mrs. Lurie.
   In an unusual gesture, motivated perhaps by persistent lobbying
on her family's behalf in the United States, Israel and Europe,
Mrs. Lurie and her 13-year-old daughter were granted two-month
tourist visas so they could travel to visit her ailing mother and
married daughter in Israel.
   She is one of 10,000 Soviets allowed out as tourists last year,
but only one of a handful of ``refuseniks'' among them. Refusenik
is the term coined by human rights activists in the 1970s to denote
a person who has been repeatedly refused permission to emigrate by
Soviet authorities.
   Mrs. Lurie said she resigned her job as a high school English
teacher last year after the principal ``made life intolerable''
because of her dissident activities. She was a founder of a group
called Jewish Women Against Refusal and took part last year in a
hunger strike to press the refusenik community's case.
   The National Council of Soviet Jewry, a U.S.-based group,
estimates there are 2,500 refuseniks. Of the 22,151 Soviets allowed
to leave so far this year, all but a few were first-time
applicants, according to the group.
   The Luries first applied to leave in 1979. Emmanuel Lurie,
having quit his first job in 1964, was working for the Soviet
Academy of Science in an unclassified position. For 11 months, the
authorities considered the family's visa application, and then
granted the exit permits.
   Mrs. Lurie said she does not know why they then changed their
minds.
   ``Whenever I ask them why, they say, `well, you know better than
we do,''' she recounted.
   In the meantime, her mother was allowed to leave, as was her
married daughter. They moved to Israel, and Mrs. Lurie saw her
mother this month for the first time in nine years.
   The Supreme Soviet, or parliament, has been rewriting the
country's emigration laws to streamline and liberalize them. One
provision under consideration would revise the state secrets
clause, making five years the amount of time that must elapse
before an applicant can become eligible to leave the country.
   The Bush administration has promised that once the new law is
completed and implemented, it will consider lifting some trade
restrictions against the Soviets.
   But for Mrs. Lurie, who must return to Moscow no later than
September, it may be too late. She has been told the provisions
might apply only to new applicants, not retroactively to people
such as her husband.
   ``Many changes have happened in the Soviet Union. But there are
still prisoners of conscience, still people in Gulags, still
refuseniks like us,'' she said.
   ``And meanwhile, our lives pass, times passes, and nothing
changes.''

<HEAD>U.S., Canada To Hold Talks On Fishing Border Conflicts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department has invited Canadian
diplomats to a meeting here next week to resolve increasingly tense
boundary disputes between American fishermen and armed Canadian
marine patrols.
   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., a senior member of the House
Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee who pushed for the
negotiations, said he fears the disputes _ with each side accusing
the other of border cheating _ will end in tragedy.
   ``If this keeps up, someone is going to get killed,'' said
Studds, a critic of the Canadians' aggressive gun-pointing pursuits
of American fishing vessels spotted on the Canadian side of Georges
Bank off the Northeast coast.
   ``Clearly we have had some U.S. fishermen who have stretched
their luck, probably knowingly,'' the congressman said in a recent
interview. ``We do not condone that. But even in those cases, we
don't believe there is an excuse for armed force the way the
Canadians are doing.''
   Edward E. Wolfe, deputy assistant secretary of state for oceans
and fisheries affairs, agrees that the current situation risks
``more serious incidents and possibly loss of life.''
   Several days after meeting with Studds, Wolfe invited officials
at the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans to a series of
meetings on the growing border tensions. The meetings are scheduled
for July 31, Aug. 1 and Aug. 2.
   Wolfe, in an interview last week, said the bilateral meetings
would cover ``the whole range of legal, navigational and law
enforcement issues.''
   While the Canadians are expected to accept the invitation to
what Wolfe described as an ``urgent meeting,'' differences over the
border patrols remain deep.
   ``There's always room to maintain an open dialogue on ways in
which (the patrols) might be handled. But that's not to say there
is anything wrong at the present,'' said a Canadian Embassy
official who has followed the dispute.
   Studds, whose Cape Cod and southeastern Massachusetts district
relies heavily on commercial fishing, believes many of the border
crossings by U.S. vessels are ``honest mistakes.''
   Jeff Pike, an aide to the congressman, said five of the six
navigational charts issued to American fishermen by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contain U.S.-Canadian border
errors of up to four miles.
   That, along with differences in readings from navigational
equipment in the two countries, can account for many of the border
crossings, Studds said.
   The Canadian government, however, maintains that the U.S.
fishermen are knowingly entering Canadian waters to get an edge in
competitive fishing markets.
   ``We certainly believe they're crossing the border
deliberately,'' said Hugh Trudeau, director of Atlantic operations
for the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
   The disputes stem from an International Court of Justice
decision in 1984 establishing a border to separate the two
countries' marine zones. Before the border was established, a
``disputed zone'' existed where fishermen from both countries
fished side by side.
   Canada's tough marine enforcement was highlighted last year when
Canadian patrols fired at the Donna Lynn, a New Bedford, Mass.,
scalloper, after the vessel's captain refused to let officials on
board. The captain claimed his boat was in U.S. waters.
   Recently, another New Bedford boat was pursued by Canadian
patrols for 14 hours.

<HEAD>Expert Warns Campus Police Officials About Increasing Cult Threats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The signs of dangerous cults are everywhere,
including the nation's colleges, a cult expert told campus police
officials.
   ``You may not think it's a problem on your campus, but you have
it,'' Marcia R. Rudin, director of the International Cult Education
Program, said at a Friday meeting of the International Association
of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators.
   ``We're concerned about religious cults,'' Ms. Rudin said.
``It's been 10{ years since Jonestown. People ask us, `Haven't they
gone away?' Unfortunately not.''
   Cults _ from mind-controlling, unconventional Christian
organizations to violence-prone satanic groups _ ``are still very
much around on college campuses,'' she said.
   About 30 police officials from campuses around the country heard
from Ms. Rudin on the nature of cult activity and the warning signs
of Satanism. While none of the police officials said he or she had
experienced criminal problems with cults, several sought more
information.
   ``We've had no indication of any involvement by our college
students,'' said Bill Byars, director of campus safety at Berry
College, a school of 1,800 near Rome, Ga.
   ``But we try to stay in tune with it,'' he said. ``There are
general signs you pick up or pay attention to. ... We realize it
could happen.''
   A cult, Ms. Rudin said, is a group ``exhibiting excessive
devotion'' to an idea and using ``unethically manipulative
techniques of persuasion and control.'' She said what makes cults
dangerous _ and sometimes violence-prone _ is the attitude that the
end justifies the means.
   Some fringe Christian groups, she said, couple their city names
with the designation ``Church of Christ'' _ not to be confused with
the mainstream churches of Christ. Ms. Rudin said those fringe
groups can be ``very dangerous,'' subjecting converts to a numbing
``shepherding discipleship.''
   ``Some of these new groups don't look like cults,'' she said.
``They've tried to look more like mainstream churches to confuse
people.''
   Cults are not necessarily criminal, she said, noting it's not
against any law for a young person to give up a collegiate career
to proselytize for Christ, or even to worship Satan or wear occult
paraphernalia.
   But, she said, some cults, including satanic ones, have turned
to weapons and violence.
   Ms. Rudin urged campus police to watch for satanic trappings _
symbols, literature, daggers and sometimes heavy metal rock music _
as possible clues to the existence of ritualistic violence.
   But, she said, those things are likely harmless ``unless you see
a lot of these things together. ... Just because you dress in black
doesn't mean anything.
   ``The real problem is deciding when you've got a problem,'' she

   The pilot of a Philippine Airlines
plane that crashed on a highway, killing eight people, did not
acknowledge instructions from air traffic controllers not to land
during a heavy downpour, airport officials said Saturday.
   An official also said the runway lights were out at the time of
Friday's crash, despite an order to turn them on because of the
storm.
   The twin-engine BAC 1-11 jet with 98 people aboard missed a
runway, crashed through a concrete wall, and bounced onto Manila's
South Expressway, killing eight people on the ground and injuring
91 people. One person was in critical condition Saturday.
   The plane smashed at least four vehicles when it bounced off the
12-lane highway and careened onto railroad tracks next to the
highway, witnesses said.
   It was traveling to the capital from Zamboanga City, 540 miles
southeast of Manila.
   Visibility was limited because of heavy rain, officials said.
However, no official cause of the crash has been given.
   When the plane was over the runway, ``the pilot was given
instructions to pull up, based on the analysis of the controller
that he was not going to make it,'' Rudy Flores, the control tower
supervisor, told The Associated Press. He did not say exactly how
high the plane was at the time.
   ``The pilot did not acknowledge and instead of pulling up, he
continued to descend,'' Flores said.
   Airline spokesman Enrique Santos refused to comment on Flores'
statement, saying an investigation was under way. Santos said
earlier Friday that the pilot, Capt. Ricardo Misa, had been cleared
for landing ``when the runway is in sight.''
   Misa himself was not available for comment.
   Rose Reyes, Flores' deputy, confirmed that the plane had
initially been cleared to land when the aircraft last radioed the
tower from five miles away. She said, however, that the rainstorm
got worse after that.
   Flores said the instructions to the pilot were changed when
controllers judged he could not safely land.
   The runway lights also were out during the mid-afternoon crash
despite the storm, Ms. Reyes said.
   At least 20 minutes before the crash, after skies darkened and
rain started falling in sheets, tower controllers told airport
electricians to turn on the lights to help guide the plane, she
said.
   ``They told us the lights were on, that's it's OK, but when we
saw that there were no runway lights, we called them again,'' Ms.
Reyes said. ``There may have been something wrong with the lights,
maybe the cables. We don't know.''
   Airline officials have turned over the plane's flight and voice
recorders to a five-man investigation team from the Air
Transportation Office.

   A hooded gunman dressed in black burst into a
Bible study graduation ceremony and blasted three people with a
shotgun, killing two women and wounding a man.
   The shooting Friday night occurred at a celebration for children
finishing a weeklong study class.
   About 50 people, half of them children, were at the Mount Olive
Church of God in Christ, which has been active in fighting drugs in
the gang-plagued neighborhood south of downtown.
   Police said they had no immediate explanation for the shootings.
   The killer, who may have had an accomplice, was at large today,
said Lt. Charles Massey.
   ``He had a mask on his face and a sawed-off shotgun,'' said
Nancy Wright, who spoke to a witness to the shooting. ``When he
started firing, everybody hit the floor.''
   Police today identified the victims as Mae Lee 76, and
Patronella Luke, 35. Mrs. Luke's husband, Peter Luke, 33, was shot
in the leg and taken to California Medical Center, said police Sgt.
Frank Mena.
   Another witness, who spoke to The Associated Press by phone from
inside the church said the congregation was listening to the
preacher when they heard two shots fired outside the church.
   A few minutes later, a man in a ski mask with a shotgun calmly
entered and shot three times.
   ``I was the first to face the barrel,'' said the woman, who
refused to give her name. ``I prayed, `Don't let him shoot me.' I
sat very still and he walked on.''
   A woman in her 30s was shot point-blank in the face. The other
victim was an elderly woman, shot as she tried to flee, said Ms.
Wright.
   ``One lady turned to run to the bathroom and he shot her in the
back,'' she said, citing the witness.
   The church is in an area plagued by gang activity, which police
have been attempting to control by deploying large task forces.

Democrats, in power for the last 34 years, primarily because of an
influence-buying scandal that forced Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita's resignation and because of a 3 percent sales tax that
took effect in April. Farm groups have protested recent moves to

<HEAD>Engine Failure Shouldn't Down An Airliner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators are trying to find out why an
airliner designed to fly without one of its engines couldn't and
why an engine designed to contain its own failure apparently didn't.
   Government engineers and scientists poring over the wreckage and
records of Flight 232 have not yet found the cause of the United
Airlines DC-10 crash Wednesday that killed more than a third of the
296 people aboard.
   What they knew by the weekend was that an explosive engine
failure occurred while the three-engine airliner was en route from
Denver to Chicago, that portions of the tail section were damaged
in the explosion, and that the hydraulic flight control systems had
lost all its fluid by the time the plane crash-landed at the Sioux
City airport.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was focusing in the
first days of what will be a months-long investigation on the
15-year-old airliner's engine-carrying tail section, the disabled
hydraulic systems, the plane's maintenance records and the actions
of its cockpit crew.
   In the long run, they also will examine issues related to
aircraft design, crew training, passenger survival after impact,
performance of the air traffic control system and federal oversight
of maintenance, along with emergency preparations and performance
on the ground.
   Jim Burnett, the safety board member supervising the
investigation, said the engine explosion conceivably could have
caused the failure of three independent hydraulic systems which
come closest together in the plane's tail. But investigators were
still searching for parts of the engine. Some material from the
tail area was found up to 60 miles from the crash site.
   If the engine explosion damaged the hydraulics, the key
unanswered question remains: What caused the jet engine to explode?
   Among possibilities being considered:
   _ A maintenance problem. Repair work was done in the area of the
engine a day before the flight.
   _ Material from the engine itself or from another part of the
plane might have flown into the interior, aviation experts say.
   _ Birds have also disabled engines in the past, although engines
must pass a test in which a chicken is thrown into the intake.
   Federal regulations require that engines be built to withstand
any probable occurrence. But they need not be designed to survive a
scenario that has less than a one-in-a-billion chance of occurring.
   They also are supposed to be designed so an ``uncontained engine
failure'' will blow material out through the rear and away from the
plane. The engine housing is supposed to be strong enough to
prevent dislodged engine parts such as a fan blade from blowing
into the passenger section or other parts of the plane.
   But aircraft are built to be as light as possible, and an
explosive failure could have the force of a powerful bomb, in which
case no housing would be strong enough to contain it.
   Airliners also must be able not only to fly but to climb with
one engine out. Single engine failures in flight are not unusual,
and if no other damage is done to the plane, a pilot usually has
the option of completing his flight.
   Flight 232 pilot Al C. Haynes told investigators that the only
means he had of controlling flight was to use engine thrust.
Applying power to both engines would make the plane go up,
decreasing power would cause it to descend.
   Applying small amounts of power to one wing engine could turn
the plane. Haynes told ground control he could only turn to the
right, indicating control surfaces such as the rudder might have
been stuck in a position that prevented left turns, said Federal
Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrar.
   Haynes had an off-duty pilot ``on his knees manipulating the
throttle,'' according to Burnett.
   Aviation experts describe the feat as remarkable _ something
pilots aren't even trained to do. Although the plane tumbled and
exploded in the landing, Haynes managed to get it down in such a
way that most passengers and crew survived.
   The General Electric CF6-6D engines, used exclusively on DC-10s
since both the planes and engines went into service in the early
1970s, pass all FAA requirements.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said Friday there was no
need to ground DC-10s as occurred after the 1979 crash of an
American Airlines DC-10 in Chicago that killed 273 people. The
plane was allowed to fly again after 37 days and the crash was
blamed on an improper maintenance procedure.
   Asked whether people should avoid flying on DC-10s, Skinner
said, ``No, not at this point.''

   In the glow of celebrating the Apollo 11
anniversary with the men who landed on the lunar surface, President
Bush proposed a commitment to go back to the moon _ ``this time,
back to stay.''
   The trip he laid out for the nation would be step-by-step: a
space station first, then the moon, and eventually Mars. ``Each
mission should and will lay the groundwork for the next,'' the
president said.
   That's akin to laying the groundwork for a driving trip across
country by wheeling around the block for a few years and then
gaining experience in the next suburb for a few years more.
   Predictably, advocates of exploring with satellites and probes _
which don't need expensive creature comforts _ were aghast. But
manned space flight supporters rushed to praise the Bush outline,
delivered Thursday on the 20th anniversary of the first moon
landing.
   Space station yes. Mars yes. But why go to the moon?
   ``In my view there is no good reason,'' said Carl Sagan, the
Cornell astronomer who has led the scientific community's fight for
sending humans to Mars. ``The moon is not much like Mars. It's not
any closer to Mars, in the idea of a way station or stepping stone.
   ``Scientifically it is very different. Mars has an atmosphere,
polar caps, evidence of past running water. It has the possibility
of ancient life. The moon has none of that. The moon is static,
airless, pretty dull.''
   Lewis Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society,
said: ``The case for a moon base has not yet been made. The idea of
permanently occupying the moon is one that is not justified.
   ``We haven't permanently occupied the oceans. The notion that we
are going back to the moon to stay, and all that implies, is not
yet well founded.''
   Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., chairman of the House space
subcommittee, said he would prefer to send astronauts straight to
Mars ``unless there is extraordinary scientific value for that
being a first step.'' There's been no such evidence, he said, and
``common sense would say it will delay us in time and it will cost
us more if we go back to the moon.''
   The New York Times, in an editorial, called a return to the moon
``a failure of imagination and fresh thought'' and pointed out that
NASA already has a ton of moon rocks.
   The president offered neither timetable nor money in his
expansive vision for ``a journey into tomorrow'' whose bills will
come due long after he has moved out of the White House. What he
offered is American leadership.
   ``Why the moon? Why Mars? Because it is humanity's destiny to
strive, to seek, to find. And because it is America's destiny to
lead,'' he said.
   The budding controversy is joined by those who, like Rep. Bill
Green, R-N.Y., think only machines belong in space, not humans.
   ``Currently, Congress is split between science and go-man-go,''
he said. ``I see no scientific justification for putting a colony
on the moon and no scientific justification for visiting Mars.''
   And, he added, one cost of sending men to the moon first is to
get to Mars later. ``If you're going to Mars directly, you are
looking at (the year) 2009. But if you are going to do it via the
moon, you are looking at the second decade in the 21st Century.''
   None of this comes as any surprise to Frank Martin, who heads
the exploration office of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   ``I'm sure we are going to have a nice debate over this in the
next six months,'' he said. ``As you can imagine, we put a lot of
thought into this. Recognizing in the long term that Mars is
sexier, it's the long range view we need to be taking.''
   Nobody wants to repeat the mistakes of the Apollo program of the
1960s, when getting to the moon and returning home was the only
goal: to beat the Soviets.
   The moon is attractive as an outpost, Martin said, because
``it's possible to have significant achievements in 10 years. When
you start asking people to work and asking the nation to focus on
something, it's got to be something where the milestone is
achievable in some finite period.''
   Other good reasons, said Martin, are:
   _ ``We know a great deal about the moon, we have ... a good data
base of understanding of what's there and how to work with that.
   _ ``It's nearby, it's three days away. When you commit people to
Mars you are talking six months to a year just to get there.
   _ ``Mars is one third of the gravitational field of the Earth;
the moon is one sixth Earth gravity ... if they do well in the one
sixth gravitational environment we know they will do well in
one-third G.''
   In addition, he said, the technical and engineering experiences
on the surface of the moon can be used to develop the systems to be
used on Mars.
   In Sagan's view that's not a good argument for a moon stop.
   ``I understand the institutional reasons for wanting an
intermediate goal,'' he said, ``but what worries me is that the
milestone may supplant the objective _ that the moon may be a dead
end. It might gobble up all the fiscal, intellectual and practical
resources. There is no test for Mars exploration we can't do more
cheaply or safely in Earth orbit or on the Earth itself.''
   Sagan and Friedman praised the Bush speech.
   ``It is, after all, the first commitment by an American
president to send humans to Mars,'' said Sagan. ``If it contained
absolutely nothing else, I'm for it.''
   Friedman said Bush should be commended ``for finally being a
president who stepped up to say space has a national purpose to
serve the country.''
   Both scientists said they wished Bush had proposed the Mars
journey as an international venture with the Soviets, who have said
they wanted to do it that way.
   ``Missions of this scale cannot be justified to satisfy the
curiosity of scientists to provide some vicarious sense of
exploration by the American people,'' Sagan said. ``It's too much
money. Just as Apollo needed a major political justification, the
competition with the Russians, so this needs a major political
justification. It can't be just competition; it has to be
cooperation.''

   A street-corner preacher who opposed filming
of a Rob Lowe movie at his apartment building was led away in
handcuffs after he allegedly pushed an off-duty policeman guarding
the set.
   ``I don't want people filming pornography at my home. Take that
filth to another building,'' shouted John Medford as he was led off
to jail Friday. He was still in jail Saturday unable to post $250
bail for investigation of misdeameanor battery.
   Medford, 47, lives in the Glen-Donald cooperative apartments
where scenes for the film ``Bad Influence'' are being shot.
   Medford lost a legal battle Wednesday to stop the filming of
what he termed an ``immoral and sinful'' movie at the site.
   Medford was arrested after he kept moving light stands from the
sidewalk set of the movie, police Sgt. Alex Salazar said.
   Lowe is being sued and investigated by authorities over a
videotaped sex act involving a 16-year-old girl in Atlanta.

   The 40-foot Maddencruiser is a rolling home equipped with a
queen-sized bed, shower, stereo system with compact disc player,
office, galley, VCR deck and a cellular telephone.
   The testing consists of a rigorous driving skills course that
includes turning, stopping, backing and maneuvering around barrels,
cones and pylons.
   Competitors also have to take a written exam and compete in a
pre-trip and trouble-shooting inspection and be interviewed by
Madden.

   Miners in the country's biggest coal field on
Saturday rejected a government offer to end their weeklong strike,
and reports indicated half the coal industry's 1 million workers
remained off the job.
   ``All mines have stopped,'' the Tass news agency reported from
the Donetsk Coal Basin in the Ukraine.
   Miners in one major coal center, Karaganda in the republic of
Kazakhstan, began returning to work after negotiators worked out a
settlement package, Tass said. But other strikes were depriving
vital factories of fuel and threatening industry nationwide.
   The Donetsk Basin has 121 pits with an annual production of 210
million metric tons.
   Miners, many in helmets and overalls, gathered outside
government offices in the city of Donetsk and rejected the pact,
which would have increased vacation time and paid workers for time
spent descending into pits.
   Western reporters said about 5,000 miners assembled to vote down
the deal. Strike leaders told a rally they would continue the
walkout because they didn't have faith the government would
implement the agreement.
   ``The strikers insist on the immediate satisfaction of their
conditions for retirement benefits for miners, which is not within
the competence of local authorities, and also that the government
guarantee fulfillment of their demands,'' Tass said.
   After learning miners had not accepted the proposals, President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov sent a
telegram urging them ``to return to work, because the situation in
several economic sectors has reached critical levels.''
   The Kremlin leaders assured strikers their demands ``would be
reviewed urgently by the Supreme Soviet (parliament) and the
Council of Ministers, with participation by representatives of the
miners, to reach the necessary decisions,'' Tass reported.
   About 300,000 Donetsk miners have been striking since July 15,
holding out for more concessions than those granted Siberian miners
who began the wave of labor unrest July 11.
   The Siberian miners from the Kuznetsk Coal Basin _ the nation's
second-largest coal field _ returned to work Thursday and Friday
after they were promised pay increases, more consumer goods and
greater control over their industry.
   Officials have said the Kuznetsk settlement would apply to
miners nationwide, but the remaining strikers were holding out for
more concessions.
   Alexander E. Makarsky, a TV journalist in Donetsk, said in a
telephone interview a proposed settlement was reached Saturday
after two days of negotiations between miners' representatives, the
government and the official trade union. He said it included
earlier pension eligibility, pay increases and extended vacations
to 42 days, with even more time offered to miners working in
especially difficult or dangerous conditions.
   Miners currently get 27 vacation days, Viktor I. Alexyanko, a
strike leader in Makeyevka in the Donetsk basin, said in a
telephone interview.
   The Kuznetsk agreement also extended vacations to 42 days, but
the labor daily Trud quoted Donetsk strike leader V. Koval as
saying Donetsk miners want more vacation because their work
conditions are worse.
   Koval said Donetesk pits are two or three times deeper than
those in other regions and that temperatures in them sometimes go
above 104.
   Makarsky said another provision in the agreement would have
given miners pay for the time it takes them to descend into the
pits _ sometimes up to two hours.
   In Karaganda, negotiators reviewed 45 demands and signed an
agreement Saturday to end a two-day strike, Tass said. All miners
in the city went back to work and those in outlying areas, at 26
mines, were following, news agency reported.
   Among the demands of Karaganda miners were that nuclear weapons
tests be stopped at the Semipalatinsk range in Kazakhstan and that
destruction of medium-range nuclear weapons be stopped elsewhere in
the republic, according to Trud. The miners contend those
activities are harming the environment.
   There was no immediate word whether the government agreed to the
nuclear-related demands.
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya said miners remained on strike
at 11 of the 13 mines in Vorkuta in the Pechora Basin in the Arctic
and at all 12 mines in Chervonograd in the western Ukraine. Anatoly
Dotsenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Helsinki Watch Group in
Moscow, said the strike also spread to four of the eight mines of
Novovolynsk in the western Ukraine on the Polish border but that
miners there returned to work after a government representative
said authorities would meet their demands.
   The economic toll and threat to the coke and steel industries
was a major theme of Saturday's press reports.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said the steel industry was in a ``critical
state'' because it lacked coal. A Karaganda steel plant director
warned he had only a day's worth of coal reserves, and steelworkers
in Pavlograd in the Donetsk Basin said they had only a two-day
supply, newspapers reported.
   Pravda said a boiler station and asphalt plant in Pavlograd have
shut down because of the fuel shortage.
   Trud said there was a threat of cave-ins and floods of water at
striking mines, apparently because maintenance crews were striking.

<HEAD>Group Seeks To Recall School Board Member Because of Homosexuality</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group has launched a petition drive to
recall the school board president in this San Francisco suburb,
accusing him of defrauding voters by not disclosing he is gay until
after he had been in office for four years.
   The Fremont Family Alliance filed recall papers last week
against board president Robert Stipicevich. The group has five
months to gather 12,000 signatures for a recall measure to be put
on the ballot.
   Stipicevich, who was one of the youngest elected officials in
California when he won a school board seat four years ago at age
22, says he disclosed his homosexuality at a news conference in May
because was tired of constant whispering behind his back.
   ``I think it's real important to say that I am not living a
lie,'' he said. ``There isn't an office in the land or a position
in the country that's worth it.''
   He called Fremont, a San Francisco suburb with a population of
more than 130,000, a ``diverse community and they're not going to
be bothered by this. It's irrelevant to the job I'm doing on the
school board.''
   In addition to defrauding voters, the Family Alliance says, his
homosexuality created a conflict of interest, arguing that he
should have abstained from voting on the school district's recently
enacted AIDS education curriculum.
   ``We're bombarded by the media emphasizing that it's OK to be so
liberal and that since the largest city in the area accepts it, it
must be so,'' said Ron Smith, a spokesman for the group.
   ``We don't want outside forces dictating how Fremont should be
run and the type of politics that should be here,'' he added. The
alliance includes some ministers, but no church organization has
officially backed it.
   The petition drive has prompted soul-searching in this town,
which was named 33 years ago for a pioneer explorer because its
citizens considered themselves a progressive community.
   His foes say community identity is at stake. Many feel the idea
that gay people should be open about their lifestyles in this
politically moderate enclave is an attempt to import ``gay
politics'' from San Francisco, 35 miles northeast.
   Fremont isn't the only city in the region concerned about gay
rights issues. An anti-AIDS discrimination measure faces a
referendum in nearby Concord, where similar charges of outside
influence have been made.
   And in San Francisco itself, a proposal to overturn the city's
domestic-partnership law has been placed on the ballot after church
groups circulated referendum petitions. The law gives homosexual
couples some benefits available to married couples.
   ``I hope it's a trend,'' said Smith. ``You're finding a backlash
because people have just sat still and finally something had to
happen.''
   He said that even though Stipicevich's term expires next year,
the group is seeking a recall vote to bring the issue before the
public.
   Stipicevich, a shipping and mail supervisor for a clothing
chain, recently received glowing endorsements from other school
board members. At the first board meeting after his announcement,
75 supporters showed up and gave him a standing ovation, and he
says he has received hundreds of letters of support from across the
country.
   But Stipicevich also has received a death threat, a few obscene
letters and the recall drive. Former City Councilman Ken Steadman
told Stipicevich at one board meeting he was exploiting children
because of his ``moral corruptions.''
   State Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin calls the issue needlessly
divisive.
   ``Bob did what he felt he had to do,'' she said. ``I can't make
that decision for him.''
   ``The question on balance is if Bob is making good policy
decisions, not whether he should have come out of the closet.''

<HEAD>At Least 43 Killed in Kabul's Worst Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas fired eight rockets
into the capital Saturday, killing at least 43 people and wounding
more than 100 in the deadliest attack on the city in 11 years of
civil war, government and hospital officials said.
   ``The most obvious reaction on the part of the government would
be to retaliate,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammed Nabi
Amani.
   State-run Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, Pakistan, said 40
people were killed in the attack and 137 injured. Amani, who called
it the worst attack on the capital, said at least 40 people were
killed and 114 wounded.
   Hospital sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later
that at least three people had died of their wounds.
   ``Many of the injured are in a very critical condition,'' said
one doctor, as nurses tore strips of cloth into bandages. ``There
is no way we can save them.''
   At least 20 people died when a rocket landed at a bus station
near the city center, Amani said. The terminal was crowded with
people when the rocket hit at 10 a.m., witnesses said.
   ``I was selling cigarettes when suddenly I heard a loud bang and
people around me started screaming,'' said Mohammad Abdullah, a
16-year-old vendor, as he spoke from his hospital bed. ``That is
the last thing I remember.''
   Pakistani-based guerrilla forces had no immediate comment on
Saturday's attack.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have in the past denied
responsibility for attacks on civilian areas. They have said the
government shells its own capital to throw the blame on them.
   Guerrillas have said, however, that rockets meant for military
targets sometimes go astray.
   Rebels and troops of the Marxist government have continued to
battle for control of the country despite the withdrawal of the
final Soviet troops last February. The Soviets sent forces to
bolster the government, which they continue to support with arms
shipments.
   One rocket landed 100 yards from the office of Prime Minister
Sultan Ali Kishtmand, breaking windows but causing no casualties,
Amani said. Casualties were reported from a marketplace and a
construction site near the Foreign Ministry, he said.
   The government closed off all areas near government buildings
and ordered a security clampdown on the city.
   ``Behind the terrorists who fired the rockets are the
blood-stained hands of Pakistan and the United States,'' Amani said.
   Diplomatic sources in Kabul estimate at least 10,000 guerrillas
have surrounded the capital. However, the sources believe those
forces, used to guerrilla warfare, are incapable of mounting a
successful assault on the city.
   After the Soviet pullout, the guerrillas concentrated on an
offensive at the eastern city of Jalalabad. After more than four
months, the city remains in government hands.
   Qaribur Rehman Saeed, of the rebel-controlled Afghan News
Agency, has said no frontal assaults on Kabul are planned.
   He said the seven guerrilla parties headquartered in Pakistan
have instead developed a strategy of rotating attacks on military
targets.
   The previous worst attack on Kabul was on April 27, when 65
rockets were fired into the city and 27 people were killed.

   A street vendor set himself on fire
Saturday during a demonstration in which 2,000 people threw rocks
and firebombs at police to protest new government restrictions on
vendors in Seoul.
   The man survived when police put out the blaze with fire
extinguishers.
   Police said 30 other people were injured and 20 parked cars were
damaged by rocks. It was not clear whether any police officers were
hurt during the two-hour clash in front of Myongdong Cathedral in
central Seoul.
   Police blocked the protesters with interlocked shields.
   Witnesses said Park Ho-kyu, 29, poured gasoline over his body
and set himself on fire during the clash. Park _ who suffered burns
on his hands, neck and chest _ was taken to a hospital, where he
was expected to recover.
   The man, who sold hats near the plush Lotte Hotel, and the other
vendors are enraged by a new government regulation that forbids
them to sell in downtown areas. The rule was designed to help keep
the city's streets clean.

   Iranian authorities confiscated hundreds
of silk carpets before they could be smuggled out of the country,
then discovered the rugs were stuffed with jewelry, the official
news agency said Saturday.
   The shipment of hand-woven carpets, the largest taken from
smugglers in 10 years, was valued at tens of millions of dollars,
and the jewelry was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, the
report said.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said
intelligence officers in two southwestern provinces discovered the
774 carpets in tanker trucks last week. They were to have been
loaded on boats in Bushehr province.
   The rugs were seized after a tip from intelligence ministry
officers in neighboring Fars province, the report said. The
ministry was assigned the task of investigating carpet smuggling
activities a month ago, IRNA said.

<HEAD>Ugandan Officers Arrested in Civilian Deaths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Several military officers have been
arrested and accused of negligence in the deaths of 47 people who
suffocated when soldiers locked them in railroad cars for three
days, Radio Uganda reported Saturday.
   ``After preliminary investigations, it has been established that
a total of 47 people died as a result of gross criminal negligence
by the officer in command,'' the state-owned radio said, quoting a
government statement.
   Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, the army commander, signed the statement,
the broadcast said. It did not give the names or number of officers
arrested, but said they included a brigade commander.
   The statement said the victims were among 238 youths detained
June 10 and held in unused railroad cars in war-torn northeastern
Uganda. The soldiers, who were fighting rebels in the area at the
time, had rounded up the people in villages near the city of Kumi,
155 miles northeast of Kampala.
   ``Those people who died were actually the innocent. The rebels
had already been screened after a cordon-and-search operation and
had already been taken to the brigade headquaters,'' the statement
said.
   On Monday, the government-owned New Vision newspaper gave
slightly different figures, saying more than 50 of 276 youths
detained in the wagons died. The newspaper said troops locked the
youths in the wagons for three days.
   The area around Kumi is home to two rebel groups _ the Holy
Spirit Movement and the Uganda People's Democratic Army. On Friday,
New Vision reported that government troops had captured 500 rebels
and seized 501 firearms of various types in seven weeks of fighting
in the region.

   Apartment buildings burned out of control
Saturday and cars smoldered in streets carpeted with rubble after
nine hours of artillery battles across the capital between Syrian
and Christian forces.
   Police said six people were killed and 52 wounded overnight.
   Shellfire severed power cables and plunged the city _ which
usually gets one to two hours of power a day _ into darkness. The
only lights that illuminated the skies were the flashes of
exploding shells.
   Ambulances drove on sidewalks, hugging the walls of high-rise
apartment buildings for cover. Through loudspeakers they shouted:
``A civil defense team is in the area. Please notify us if you need
any help.''
   ``Over here! Over here!'' a man's voice echoed in the densely
populated west Beirut neighborhood of Zaidaniyeh. The rescuers
rushed in the dark in the direction of the voice to find a family
trapped under a demolished house.
   In the district of Koreitem, artillery rounds blasted a building
while inhabitants were in the underground shelter.
   When the shelling eased, Soumaya Medawar emerged from hiding to
find her apartment a pile of rubble. Unable to cope with the shock,
Mrs. Medawar, 68, suffered a heart attack and died instantly.
   The casualties from the shelling raised the toll to 440 killed
and 1,836 wounded in the 18-week confrontation between mainly
Christian troops under Gen. Michel Aoun, who heads a Christian
government, and the Syrians, who back a rival Moslem government.
   ``Several casualties remained under the rubble for quite a long
time, simply because no one had a telephone line to request help
from rescuers,'' a police spokesman said, insisting on anonymity in
line with standing regulations.
   The divided capital shook as Syrian gunners entrenched in west
Beirut operated their Soviet-designed 122mm BM-21 multi-barreled
rocket launchers that fire 40 projectiles a minute.
   The rockets blasted residential districts in Christian east
Beirut, the coastline to the north and hills to the east and
northeast.
   Aoun's troops opened up with 155mm howitzers and 130mm mortars,
targeting mainly Syrian military positions, but many rounds
ricocheted to nearby areas.
   The right-wing Lebanese Forces coalition of Christian militias
fired randomly onto west Beirut and its suburbs, sparing no
neighborhood in retaliation for the Syrian barrages.
   Thousands of people fled during a morning lull, carrying with
them whatever they could salvage of their belongings. Christians
fled toward mountain resorts to the northeast, and west Beirut's
inhabitants headed toward south Lebanon.
   ``I'll stay with relatives in the south for a while. I have to
find a place where one can get some sleep and stay alive,'' said
Rashid Makkouk, who works at a spare parts shop in west Beirut.
   Makkouk, 42, said his wife and two children ``went crazy during
the shelling last night. Dozens of rockets exploded within seconds
in our street setting apartments on fire and destroying cars.''
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads a
Cabinet competing for legitimacy with the Christian government
under Aoun, conferred by telephone with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd,
sources in Riyadh said.
   Fahd is one of the most influential leaders in the Arab world.
The Saudi monarch, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algerian President
Chadli Bendjedid are grouped in a an Arab League committee trying
to pacify Lebanon.
   Saudi Arabia is Syria's main bankroller. It also has good ties
with the pro-Western Christians.
   The latest round of violence in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war
broke out two days after Aoun clamped a blockade of ports run by
Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut in an effort to recoup $100
million annually in lost customs dues.
   The Syrians and allied forces retaliated by besieging the
310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the city.
   Aoun, 54, a Maronite Catholic, escalated the confrontation by
declaring a ``war of liberation'' against Syria's 40,000 troops,
stationed in Moslem regions under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate.

   Former premier Giulio Andreotti stepped forward
again Saturday to form Italy's 49th postwar government, ending a
nine-week political crisis prompted by Socialists' opposition to
his predecessor.
   Andreotti's government is made up of a broad coalition of the
five parties that have governed together for most of the 1980s.
   The new premier presented his list of Cabinet ministers to
President Francesco Cossiga on Saturday evening, said Sergio
Berlinguer, secretary-general of the president's office.
   Asked how long he thought the new government would last,
Andreotti told reporters, ``You never know how long a child will
live: one hopes a long time. We are looking toward 92.''
   The next general elections are scheduled for 1992.
   The 70-year-old Andreotti, a member of the center-right
Christian Democrats, became premier for the sixth time. He was
premier twice between 1972 and 1973 and three times between 1976
and 1979.
   Andreotti said Saturday his government would concentrate on
preparing Italy for 1992, when the European Community is to
eliminate trade barriers. Other priorities include fighting crime
and tax evasion and protecting the environment, he said.
   No major policy changes were expected, with the government
maintaining its strong NATO and U.S. ties.
   The new Cabinet has 32 members. Socialist Party official Claudio
Martelli became vice-premier, former vice-premier Gianni De
Michelis moved to the Foreign Ministry, former Bank of Italy
governor Guido Carli became treasury minister, and Christian
Democratic politician Fermo Mino Martinazzoli took over at the
Defense Ministry.
   Andreotti succeeds fellow Christian Democrat Ciriaco De Mita,
who resigned May 19 after Socialist Party leader Bettino Craxi
criticized his leadership.
   Cossiga asked De Mita to try to revive the 13-month-old
coalition, but De Mita failed because of continued opposition from
the Socialists. Two weeks ago, the president turned to Andreotti,
who worked closely with Craxi in previous governments.
   Andreotti's coalition is comprised of the same parties that were
in De Mita's government: the dominant Christian Democrats, the
Socialists and the small Republican, Liberal and Social Democrat
parties.
   The new Cabinet is to be sworn in Sunday.

   In the era of AIDS and soaring teen-age pregnancy
rates, age 4 is not too young to start talking about sexual
matters, say the developers of a new ``how-to'' sex education kit
aimed at the younger set.
   The $9.95 Talk Listen Care kit _ complete with coloring book,
handbooks and card game _ is headed for bookstore shelves to help
stir that discussion. It was developed by Harvard Community Health
Plan Foundation in response to high rates of U.S. teen-age
pregnancy.
   ``Solid communication has to be established with kids before
their teen-age time,'' said Dr. Susan Pauker, executive director of
the foundation. ``If you have open communication early on, then all
kinds of other questions come out as well and so when they hit
their years of sexuality and turbulent hormonal distress ... then
they have a place to go,'' she said.
   The kit offers such discussion tools as a family handbook for
children between 4 and 8, a book to help prepare parents to talk to
pre-teens about sex, a coloring book and a card game for ages 9 and
up.
   In the game, players read a scenario from cards they draw and
offer an opinion.
   Subjects range from the general _ drinking, messy rooms, divorce
_ to the more sensitive.
   ``My friend Jennifer is pregnant!'' reads one. ``She has always
said abortion was wrong, but now she's not sure. She is scared that
she's wrecked her life. What do you think?''
   Another situation poses the question of whether Felicia and Tom
who are thinking of ``going all the way,'' should get birth
control, ``just in case.''
   The cards offer questions, but answers are strictly up to the
players.
   ``It's not a teacher's values, nor a pediatrician's values but
rather the parent's own values,'' Pauker said.
   Some of the cards deal with sexual issues, such as
contraception, AIDS and abortion. But many deal with problems such
as fights over staying out late, how much TV is too much, the fear
of being kidnapped and what to do about suspected child abuse.
   The kit also has a quiz for parents that point up common foibles
such as being too embarrassed to name body parts, doling out stingy
amounts of information or waiting for the child to broach the
question of sex.
   Tips to parents include practicing saying awkward words in front
of a mirror.
   The techniques help blunt the awkwardness of talking about sex,
a topic that parents can't afford to ignore, Pauker said.
   Three thousand adolescents unintentionally become pregnant each
day, or 1.1 million per year, according to the Alan Guttmacher
Institute in New York. Coupled with those figures are studies
showing that 80 percent of all parents don't talk about sex to
their children.
   That means children are getting their information elsewhere,
mostly from television shows that often don't present a realistic
view of sex or its consequences, Pauker said.
   ``I think what happens in middle school with a lot of kids is
they decide they know it all,'' she said. ``All of the myths, like
you never can get pregnant your first time, need to be dispelled
before they get started.''
   Starting young doesn't necessarily mean delivering all the facts
of life to a toddler. The educational materials advise stopping
once a child's attention wanders and keeping answers short and
simple.
   ``Even verbal little, tiny kids are capable of asking very
important questions,'' Pauker said. ``It's also important for
parents. You have to get together on how you're going to speak in
this regard. You don't want one side giving the stork story and one
side giving technical information.''
   Development of the kit showed that parents' biggest fears of
open communication was ``that the kids would consider it a license
to get pregnant or a license to behave sexually,'' Pauker said.
``But then they began to realize that the opposite occurs. That
once there was knowledge that there wouldn't be this curiosity.''
   Children, too, were apprehensive about discussing sex, she said.
   ``In the beginning they start to be really embarrassed,'' she
said. The game and coloring book approach of the kit helped
children get over the awkwardness, she said.

   A tractor-trailer smashed into a line of
cars and trucks stalled by an accident a mile ahead on the
Pennsylvania Turnpike, killing five people in the fiery pileup
Saturday.
   The truck driver and a family of four were killed, while some
other drivers apparently were spared because they had stepped out
of their cars and were standing alongside the road, police said.
   The northbound lanes of the turnpike's Northeast Extension were
shut down for more than nine hours between Norristown and Lansdale,
both suburbs of Philadelphia.
   Police said two men were hurt in the first accident about nine
miles north of Norristown. A car driven by Gregory C. D'Amario, 37,
of Bayville, N.J., was passing a tractor-trailer loaded with used
telephone poles when it went out of control, hit the median
guardrail and bounced into the back of the trailer, said State
trooper Carl Williams.
   The trailer jackknifed and turned over so that the rig ended up
skidding sideways, blocking both northbound lanes and the shoulder,
Williams said.
   D'Amario and Barton Washington, 33, of Philadelphia, were taken
to North Penn Hospital in Lansdale, D'Amario for head, neck and
back injuries and Washington for back and neck injuries.
   Traffic was backed up for about a mile south of the accident,
according to Williams, when a tractor-trailer topping a hill plowed
into the back of the line.
   It hit a tanker truck, knocked it aside, and smashed into five
cars ahead. A fire broke out and engulfed the truck and three cars,
Williams said. The tanker wasn't involved in the fire.
   Police withheld the names of the victims of the second accident.
   Five people hurt in the pileup were taken to Suburban General
Hospital in Norristown, where Dr. Edward Schreiber said one was
admitted in unstable condition and a second was admitted in stable
condition. Three were treated and released in the emergency room,
he said.
   Both people admitted suffered abdominal injuries, Schreiber
said. The three others had cuts and bruises.

<TEXT>
   When word arrived that United Airlines Flight 232
had crashed in Sioux City, a team of airline workers rushed into
action to deal with human and technical emergencies _ and to limit
damage to the airline's image.
   United's performance in the hours following last week's crisis
won praise from several public relations experts, although others
criticized the airline's initial refusal to provide basic
information to the public.
   ``United told too little at first,'' said Matthew Gonring, a
former public relations officer for the airline who works for USG
Corp.
   ``When that happens, the news media gravitates toward sources
outside the company. Better to have information come from qualified
sources than let bystanders speculate,'' Gonring said.
   ``There were facts that were available at the time. The rule of
thumb is telling it all and telling it fast.''
   But others said United bolstered its credibility by releasing no
misleading information that could have led to erroneous
speculation, even if executives withheld some knowledge of events
surrounding the crash. They also praised the airline for responding
promptly, and singled out Chairman Stephen Wolf's decision to fly
to the crash scene to meet with many victims and families.
   ``It was a time for humanity, and that showed concern,'' said
Mary Lou Hedlund, an executive in Chicago with the Hill &amp; Knowlton
international public relations company.
   Ms. Hedlund contrasted Wolf's actions with those of Exxon
Chairman Lawrence Rawl, who was widely criticized for failing to
visit the site where a company tanker ran aground off Valdez,
Alaska, causing a huge oil spill in March.
   ``Big airline companies generally get gold stars in crisis
communications,'' she said. ``Exxon has a crisis plan and never
tests it. United and other airlines test theirs regularly.''
   United's crisis management response to the crash began almost
immediately. A news conference was quickly arranged, with Lawrence
Nagin, senior vice president, talking publicly about the disaster
within four hours of it.
   Nagin expressed sorrow but declined to speculate on casualties
or other aspects of the accident. He refused to release the
flight's departure time, and, when pressed, described the crash
only as ``an in-flight emergency that occurred, but that's
obvious.''
   United also initially dampened speculation about survivors, and
declined to release complete passenger lists while waiting for
positive identification from the coroner in Sioux City.
   That angered some relatives seeking information about their
loved ones.
   But others said the cautious approach worked in the airline's
favor when the number of survivors turned out to be larger than
many had feared.
   ``United didn't give out false or misleading information
early,'' said Bob Keyser, a public relations consultant who used to
work for McDonald's Corp.
   ``You went to bed thinking many people had perished and you woke
up to the reassuring news that many people had lived,'' Keyser said.
   United officials defend their initial refusal to tell all.
   ``We knew information about the aircraft and what the pilot said
was going to be the central focus of the National Transportation
Safety Board investigation,'' said United spokesman Russell Mack.
   ``Our policy is not to discuss information which properly should
come out of the investigation process,'' he said.
   ``There's an enormous hunger for information at these times,''
he said. ``If you rush to fill in with anything at hand, you can
wind up making serious mistakes.''

   The Woody Allen movie ``Broadway Danny
Rose'' made a lot of people laugh. For Wandra Merrell, the
mid-1980s film brings that certain feeling lamented its theme song,
``Agita'' _ an upset stomach.
   A lawsuit she and her songwriting partner filed in U.S. District
Court in Trenton claims the verse melody of ``Agita'' borrowed 49
of the 52 notes in the verse of ``Pepino, the Italian Mouse.'' Ms.
Merrell of Cresskill and Ray Allen of Long Island, N.Y., wrote that
early-1960s novelty song, which became a No. 1 single for Lou Monte.
   What the songwriters thought would be a simple copyright
infringement case has turned into a four-year legal battle, with a
jury trial still nowhere in sight.
   ``It's been absolute hell,'' Ms. Merrell said last week. ``We've
been working against the top guns _ Orion Pictures, Woody Allen.
It's like David vs. Goliath.''
   The $50 million copyright infringement lawsuit against Allen and
Orion was dismissed last year by a judge after the defendants
bought rights to ``Pepino'' for $50,000 from SBK-EMI Music
Publishing Co. The ``Pepino'' songwriters got none of the money
from the retroactive deal.
   Ray Allen and Ms. Merrell claim the $50,000 was peanuts, and are
angry they didn't get a share. They are suing SBK for breach of
fiduciary responsibility, but the lawsuit remains mired in briefs
and pre-trial proceedings.
   Neither song involved could be considered serious fare;
``Pepino'' chronicles a mouse that does a ``cha-cha on the floor''
and ``Agita'' waxes lustily about spicy food and its effects on
one's digestive system.
   But the financial stakes are serious.
   The melody is heard 23 times in the movie, and the film has had
an estimated 2 million performances, the plaintiffs say. Those
prospective royalties and other damages reach well into the
millions of dollars, Ms. Merrell said.
   ``If people can steal what you have, every songwriter in America
is in jeopardy,'' said George Brown, Ms. Merrell's husband and
longtime manager. ``In this court, they're allowing it so far.''
   Orion Pictures and Allen's publicists did not respond to
requests for comment from The Associated Press.
   SBK vice president and senior attorney Harold Rosenbloom issued
a statement saying, ``SBK is vigorously defending the action, and
we anticipate we will ultimately be successful.''
   He declined to comment further.
   Even though Orion wound up paying the ``Pepino'' publishers,
``Agita'' composer Nick Apollo Forte denies that he copied the Lou
Monte hit.
   Forte, who also acted in ``Broadway Danny Rose,'' insisted in an
interview that the song was entirely his own work and substantially
different from ``Pepino.''
   Forte, a nightclub performer and part-time boat skipper in Snug
Harbor, R.I., said he knows how his accusers feel when it comes to
taking on the entertainment industry conglomerates. He said he
spent $40,000 of his own money in legal fees _ more than he made
from the movie, he says _ to defend ``Agita'' as his original work.
He says he finally decided to cut his losses and surrender.
   ``There's one little part that sounds similar, but the notes are
different,'' he said. ``You can't fight the big companies.''
   Ms. Merrell and Ray Allen claim the David role in this battle,
but they're hardly industry midgets. More than 200 of their songs
have been recorded by various artists, Ms. Merrell says. Among
them: ``Spanish Nights,'' a hit for Connie Francis, and ``Baby
Lover,'' made popular by Petula Clark.
   But their ditty about an Italian mouse is probably their most
enduring. It reached No. 1 on the charts in late 1962 and earned
Lou Monte a gold record on Frank Sinatra's Reprise Records.
   She and her partner say four musicologists have verified their
contention that the verses of ``Pepino'' and ``Agita'' are nearly
identical. But she's still a long way from getting a chance to
prove it to a jury. The next of many pretrial court hearings is
scheduled in late August in Trenton.
   ``We know we're going to win sooner or later,'' Ms. Merrell
said, ``but we don't want to die trying.''

   Miners in the Kuznetsk Coal Basin
of western Siberia, who began and won the first Soviet industrial
strike in 60 years, say they do not want to emulate Solidarity in
Poland by competing for power with the Communist Party.
   But in some ways, their initial demands and achievements exceed
the 1980 victory of the Polish shipyard workers and miners who
struck for and won the right to form unions independent of
government control.
   ``Solidarity's demands were too political. Our demands are only
economical,'' said Pyotr I. Kungurov, a member of the 26-member
regional Strike Committee in the Kuznetsk basin, or Kuzbass.
   After years of suppression, Solidarity emerged this spring as
Poland's main opposition party, controlling the Senate and holding
more than a third of the seats in the lower house. Solidarity hopes
for further gains when local elections are held, as early as next
year, and in national elections scheduled for 1993.
   Likewise, Soviet miners have helped change the political
landscape of the socialist world by seizing from the Communist
Party the initiative in voicing the demands of workers.
   The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia noted the ironic turn
of events in a front-page editorial Saturday evening.
   ``Those who are striking are part of the working class, the most
advanced and conscious class. Didn't you know that?'' Isvestia
commentator Valeri Vyzhutovich wrote. He quoted Karl Marx,
described by Soviet sociologists as the founder of scientific
socialism, as saying that ``freedom from management'' was a prime
goal of the working class.
   The Kuzbass miners, who began striking July 11, returned to work
Friday after winning what they described as largely economic
concessions.
   But the fire they sparked has spread, with about half the
nation's 1 million coal miners on strike in the Ukraine, Kazakhstan
and the Arctic.
   Polish workers began to seize control over their own destiny in
1980 by creating a new organization, Solidarity, and sticking with
it through the repression of martial law.
   Soviet workers are striving toward similar goals by taking
control of existing organizations, such as official trade unions,
local governments and management bodies.
   Soviet strikers appear to like President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Kungurov, describing Gorbachev as very popular among miners,
said the Soviet leader ``began the reforms from above. Now, we are
helping him from below.''
   Kremlin leaders, he said, want to decide things for themselves.
``But now the workers are coming up with their own initiatives. It
will be an impulse for perestroika,'' he said, using the Russian
word for Gorbachev's economic reforms.
   Although the Siberian miners say their demands are not
political, the first article of the protocol that sent them back to
work gives them greater control over mines and industry starting
Jan. 1.
   That concession is a major one in an economy where for 72 years
decision-making power has been concentrated largely in Moscow. It
means intially that mines will be allowed to form local and
regional associations for self-management and may sell to the
highest bidder coal produced over and above what they agree to sell
to the state.
   Eventually, the miners hope to eliminate the ``zakaz'' or quota
entirely, and sell all production on the open market, using the
profits to modernize their industry and improve living standards.
   In the meantime, they won from central authorities a commitment
to improve wages, pensions and other benefits, boost deliveries of
consumer goods, build more housing and extend vacations.
   The Kuznetsk Strike Committee, renamed the Workers' Committee
after the strike, also joined with a half-dozen Kuzbass members of
the national Congress of Peoples' Deputies on Friday to demand that
parliament schedule municipal elections in November instead of next
spring, as planned.
   The leadership of the national parliament met Saturday with
representatives of the 15 Soviet republics to consider plans for
the election, the official news agency Tass reported. The report
did not say whether the session was in response to the demands of
the Kuzbass miners.
   The Worker's Committee also has begun efforts to take over the
official trade unions.
   The miners of Prokopyevsk expressed a new-found confidence and a
determination to make sure that the government implements its
promises and makes more concessions.
   ``The first question is to see that the first agreement is
implemented,'' committee chairman Teimuraz G. Avaliani said at a
meeting Friday. ``The second question facing us is to work out a
new agreement with the government to give us more concrete
benefits.''

<HEAD>World Airways to Receive $62.9 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Port Authority has been ordered
to pay $62.9 million to World Airways for its liability in a 1982
plane crash at Logan International Airport.
   Massport officials said they would appeal Friday's ruling by
U.S. District Court Judge Robert E. Keeton, who also ruled the
airline could recover an additional $1.6 million from the federal
government.
   In earlier trials, federal juries ruled that the authority and
the Federal Aviation Administration were to blame for the January
1982 crash, which killed two people.
   The DC-10, carrying 212 passengers, attempted to land on an icy
runway at Logan, but slid off the runway and into Boston Harbor.
The nose of the plane was severed from the fuselage and passengers
and crew had to swim in the frigid waters to safety.
   While the juries determined Massport and the federal government
were to blame for not taking adequate safety measures in icy
conditions, the amount of the settlement remained to be determined
and questions of interest remained in dispute until Friday.
   The total set by Keeton takes into account $33 million for the
value of the aircraft, interest over the seven years since the
accident, and several passenger claims, The Boston Globe reported.
   Attorneys in the case told the newspaper that Massport may be
able to recover $11 million of the total settlement from the
federal government because the FAA was also found at fault.
   Other issues in the case still remain unresolved, however.
Keeton must rule on motion for a new trial relating to emotional
distress claimed by crew members.
   The pilot, Peter Langley, and his co-pilot were awarded $2
million in damages in April, but Keeton ruled that that amount was
excessive and planned to reduce it by 80 percent, the newspaper
said.

   Extremists in an ethnically torn region
of Soviet Georgia ambushed a police patrol, killing two cadets, and
seized more than 1,500 weapons in raids on police stations across
the region, Soviet media said Saturday.
   Troops patrolled the riot-torn Abkhazia region, where 19 people
have died in a week of violence between minority Abkhazians and
ethnic Georgians.
   In the capital of Sukhumi, ``fear hangs over the city,'' the
Georgian newspaper Zarya Vostoka said.
   ``The feeling is especially strong at night,'' the newspaper
said. ``That's when the gunfire starts in again and the noise is
breaking glass, revving tanks and explosions.''
   The capital has been under a state of emergency since Tuesday.
   As a result of the violence, two regional party secretaries were
fired and two government leaders in Abkhazia lost their jobs, the
official Tass news agency said.
   The attack on the police patrol occurred Friday night in the
village of Ostapi in Akbhazia, a Black Sea resort area.
   Tass said assailants opened fire on the police patrol with
hunting rifles, killing two cadets as they roadblocks and
confiscated weapons.
   The violence reportedly was sparked by Abkhazian demands to
secede from Georgia.
   Col. Gen. Yuri Shatalin, the commander of the all internal
security troops who rushed to the republic to take charge, told the
government newspaper Izvestia that Abkhazian and Georgian
extremists had attacked eight police stations and two sports shops
in western Georgia over the past 24 hours.
   ``As a result, 1,441 rifles are in the hands of extremists,'' he
said.
   Earlier attacks on police stations netted extremists hundreds of
weapons, including 56 submachine guns, 40 pistols and three machine
guns, Izvestia said.
   Shatalin blamed the seizure of the weapons on the ``careless or
treacherous behavior of police,'' apparently members of the local
ethnic groups. Since the strife began, police have confiscated more
than 2,700 firearms.
   He described one battle between Abkhazians and Georgians on a
bridge in the village of Otap on the Ochamchirsky region last
Sunday. ``There were 250 to 300 people from each side who took part
in it,'' he said. ``I haven't seen such a battle since my service
in Afghanistan.''
   Meetings between Abkhazians and Georgians took place in the
cities of Sukhumi and Gagra on Friday, Izvestia said, but did not
produce any concrete results and were ``characterized by mutual
reprimands.''
   A plenum of the regional party committee of Abkhazia met and
fired Mikhail A. Tsuladze and Said R. Tarkil from their jobs as
Communist Party secretaries, Tass said.
   The Presidium of the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet fired Premier Otar
Zugbaya and his first deputy, V.M. Tsugba, Tass said. Those
relieved of their posts appeared to include Abkhazians and
Georgians, although Tass did not specify their nationalities.
   The Tbilisi newspaper Zarya Vostoka said the situation in
Sukhumi was tense and that industry was shut down and rail and city
transport halted by strikes, apparently by ethnic Georgians
complaining that Abkhazians control all key jobs in the region.
   It quoted the head of the railroad strike committee, Murman
Fkhulukhia, as saying that Georgian leaders were ignoring their
demands, which include the resignation of Abkhazian leaders,
arrests of the instigators of violence and a change in the
personnel policies of Abkhazia.
   He said party leader Givi Gumbaridze came to listen to their
demands at 3 a.m. last Monday. ``He heard us out, but since then,
not a single one of our leaders _ party or government _ has come to
see us,'' he said. ``Aren't they interested in the fact that 750
people are on strike, and as a result, the railroads are at a
standstill?''
   Thousands of tourists were being evacuated from the popular
summer resort are of Sukumi. ``The safety is fully ensured of
vacationing children and adults as they leaving Abkhazia,'' Tass
said.
   The news agency said violence also flared Friday in the Republic
of Tadzhikistan in Central Asia, 1,500 miles southeast of Moscow,
when a fight broke out between two men of different nationalities.
   ``The fight grew into a conflict between two groups armed with
chains, sticks and stones,'' Tass said. The battle ended when
police fired shots into the air, Tass said. Forty-three people were
detained.
   The news agency did not identify the nationalities of the
combatants, although fighting was reported over water rights in the
republic earlier this month between Tadzhiks and Kirghiz. Both
nationalities are Moslem. The Kirghiz speak a Turkic dialect and
the Tadzhiks speak Persian.
   At least 132 people have died in ethnic unrest during the past
month in the southern Soviet republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan.

<HEAD>Country Opens Its Biggest Drug Rehab Center</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iran's largest drug rehabilitation center
opened Saturday, the day before the end of a six-month grace period
for addicts to give up drugs or face prosecution, Tehran radio
reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said the complex in the
western provincial capital of Hamadan will serve 5,000 addicts when
it is completed. The agency did not say when that would be. It said
the center now can serve 1,000 addicts.
   The center has two workshops where addicts can learn
professional skills. Another complex will open next month in
central Yazd province, the radio said.
   The report indicated the center was part of a rehabilitation
program run by a prison welfare organization rather than one of the
hard labor camps where officials have said 55,000 hardened addicts
will be sent when the grace period expires.
   Law enforcement authorities say they have identified 80 percent
of Iran's drug addicts. Official statistics show the country has
about 1 million addicts, but unofficial estimates put the figure at
double that.
   The government began a fierce anti-narcotics crackdown in
December following last August's cease-fire in the eight-year war
with Iraq.
   The campaign so far has focused on nabbing drug traffickers and
dealers. Nearly 800 people accused of drug trafficking have been
hanged since December and thousands of addicts have been arrested.
   A harsh anti-narcotics law that took effect in January mandates
the death sentence for possession of even small quantities of drugs.

<HEAD>Chad Blames Gadhafi for Failure of Peace Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Talks aimed at settling a border dispute
between Chad and Libya failed because Libya's leader demanded that
French troops be withdrawn from Chad, President Hissene Habre said
Saturday.
   Habre and his longtime enemy, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, met in Mali
on Thursday and Friday for their first talks in seven years.
   The presidents of four other African nations who mediated
reported that progress was being made, but the talks broke off
Friday without an agreement.
   The main dispute involves the Aouzou Strip, a 45,600-square-mile
border area, thought to be rich in uranium, that Libya occupies and
Chad claims.
   Returning home Saturday, Habre said Gadhafi insisted on the
withdrawal of ``extra-African'' troops from Chad before any
settlement could be reached.
   Gadhafi left the talks without commenting.
   France maintains 1,500 soldiers in Chad to back Habre, whose own
army chased out Libyan occupiers from most of northern Chad in 1987.
   Chad's ambassador to France, Allam-Mi Ahmad, said Libyan
intransigence was behind the failure of the talks. He told the
French news agency Agence France-Presse that Gadhafi refused to
take the border dispute to the International Court of Justice in
The Hague, refused to demilitarize the Aouzou Strip in extreme
northern Chad, and demanded the withdrawal of French troops.
   ``The French army is in Chad at the demand of Chadian
authorites,'' the ambassador said, ``and will not leave until there
are no longer any threats.''
   The talks were mediated by the leaders of Gabon, Algeria, Mali
and Nigeria. Under a proposed agreement drafted by officials from
Mali and Algeria, Chad and Libya would have tried to settle the
Aouzou border issue by political means, meaning negotiations within
the Organization of African Unity, and take it to the International
Court of Justice if those attempts failed.
   It also called for a treaty of friendship, a pledge by each
nation not to attack the other and creation of an OAU observer
force to stabilize a year-old truce.
   All prisoners would be repatriated. Chad is said to hold at
least 2,000 Libyans, but Libya says it has returned all captured
Chadians.
   Sources in Mali said Friday that Habre objected to several
points in the proposed settlement, including the immediate return
of war prisoners.
   Since Gadhafi gained power in 1969, he has supported several
anti-government groups in Chad, Libya's southern neighbor. They
included Habre's own faction when he was a guerrilla leader.
   After a Libyan invasion, government troops and allied French
soldiers drove Libyan forces out in 1987. France, the colonial
power until independence in 1960, has 1,500 soldiers in Chad to
support Habre. Libya has kept its foothold in the Aouzou Strip,
which has been in dispute for decades.
   Last month, Habre accused Libya of preparing an attack from
Sudan, Chad's eastern neighbor, with Chadian dissidents. Sudan and
Libya denied the charges.

   A judge Saturday sentenced 10 Greek
Cypriots to three days in jail for entering the Turkish-occupied
sector of Cyprus during a protest last week. Outside court, Turkish
Cypriots protested the punishments as too lenient.
   Hundreds of Greek Cypriots, mostly women, continued a sit-down
protest outside the Nicosia headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping
force. Hundreds more wrestled with U.N. troops at a buffer zone
near the village of Peristerona, 16 miles west of Nicosia, the
capital.
   The swelling demonstrations, the most prolonged since the 1974
Turkish invasion, threatened to undermine 10 months of
U.N.-sponsored talks on reunification between President George
Vassiliou, the Greek Cypriot leader, and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash.
   They are scheduled to meet again July 26, but Denktash has
indicated he may not attend the closed-door session because of the
Greek Cypriot protests.
   The 10 defendants convicted and sentenced Saturday could have
received up to 18 months in prison. Eight were also fined $100
each. Two clergymen were fined $200.
   They were in a group of 108 Greek Cypriots arrested by Turkish
authorities Wednesday while protesting on the eve of the Turkish
invasion. The other 98 defendants, all women, have not stood trial.
   Judge Gonul Orenen, in the Turkish Cypriot Nicosia District
Court, said she gave ``very lenient'' sentences to the men to keep
relations between the rival communities from deteriorating further.
   If the fines are not paid within 24 hours, the clergymen will
serve 10 more days in prison and the other eight men five more
days, she said.
   The 108 detainess were charged with entering a restricted
military zone and violating the borders of the breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus. It was proclaimed in 1983 but is
recognized only by Turkey.
   The sentencing was delayed when more than 1,000 Turkish
Cypriots, shouting ``Murderer priest!'' demonstrated outside the
courthouse.
   The crowd demanded tougher sentences when they heard Judge
Orenen's decision.
   More than 500 Greek Cypriots demonstrated in the buffer zone
near Peristerona, 16 miles west of Nicosia, to dramatize their
eviction from Philia, a Greek Cypriot village occupied when the
Turks invaded on July 20, 1974.
   The Turks invaded ostensibly to protect the Turkish Cypriot
minority in the wake of a short-lived coup by supporters of a union
with Greece.
   Philia is less than two miles from Peristerona. Its inhabitants
try to penetrate U.N. lines to reach their village every year on
the anniversary of the invasion.
   Greek Cypriot policemen, fearing a confrontation between the
demonstrators and Turkish Cypriots, tried to stop the women but
were quickly overwhelmed.
   Some 200 soldiers of the Danish contingent of the U.N. Force in
Cyprus manned four lines of barbed-wire barricades to confront any
penetration of the buffer zone. But the demonstrators argued and
scuffled with the soldiers and some 100 of them slipped through
three lines, only to be stopped at the last barricade.
   The protesters at Peristerona waved banners saying: ``We demand
our rights and implementation of U.N. resolutions.''
   That was a reference to a series of U.N. Security Council
resolutions calling for the withdrawal of 35,000 Turkish soldiers
and some 50,000 settlers from the north and the return of some
200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees to their homes in the occupied third
of the island.

   Nearly 200,000 Palestinian
children returned to classrooms in the West Bank on Saturday after
the army lifted an order that had kept their schools closed for
most of the 19-month uprising.
   Israel's Histadrut labor federation called for a two-hour,
nationwide strike Sunday to protest the government's handling of
the economy. Unions affliated with Histadrut represent 85 percent
of Israel's 2.5 million workers.
   The nation's unemployment rate rose to 9.6 percent in May, and
the Labor Ministry predicts it could exceed 10 percent before
year's end for the worst jobless rate since the 1965-67 recession.
   Israel radio said that at the Sunday Cabinet meeting Finance
Minister Shimon Peres will unveil a public works program aimed at
creating jobs.
   Thirteen Palestinians were reportedly shot and wounded Saturday
in stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. One victim was a 14-year-old girl hit in the chest with
one of the rubber-coated metal pellets the army uses for riot
control, Arab hospital officials said.
   An army spokesman said soldiers encountered stone-throwers in
several early morning raids in West Bank villages and confirmed
that one Palestinian youth was shot and wounded in a raid on the
village of Nur Shams near Nablus.
   At least 572 Palestinians and 37 Israelis have been killed since
the uprising against Israeli rule began in December 1987.
   Classes opened for elementary schoolchildren and high school
seniors, who must sit for mandatory graduation exams in November.
   But the army has not yet set a date for the remaining 100,000
junior high and high school students in the West Bank to return to
class and said that all institutions will be closed again if
violence occurs.
   ``If you want to learn, you have the opportunity to do so,''
said Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the West Bank military
government. ``If you don't, that is your choice, too.''
   The army has kept West Bank schools closed for all but two short
intervals since the start of the Palestinian revolt, contending
they were focal points for violence. They were last open in January.
   Palestinians charge it was a form of ``collective punishment,''
and the United States and international human rights organizations
have urged that classes be reopened.
   On Saturday, the sounds of children reciting Arabic and
practicing multiplication tables could be heard in both boys' and
girls' elementary schools in Bethlehem.
   Studies in the village of Beit Fajar six miles south of
Bethlehem were disrupted when tear gas fired by soldiers drifted
into the girls' school. The army said troops fired the tear gas to
disperse stone-throwers nearby. Otherwise, the opening day passed
without major incidents.
   School principals said attendance was more than 90 percent,
despite a strike called by the fundamentalist Moslem group Hamas,
or Zeal, which closed shops and shut down public transportation.
   Hamas issued a leaflet exempting students from the strike, and
graffiti on walls in Ramallah north of Jerusalem signed by Hamas
supporters said: ``With stones and pens, the blessed uprising
continues.''
   ``I'm glad to be going back,'' said 9-year-old Lina Humseyeh as
she waited in Bethlehem for a private school bus to take her to her
third-grade class. ``I helped my mother when we didn't have school,
but I was bored.''
   The teacher of Lina's English class, Nadal Barham, said she
thought closing the schools had increased rather than reduced
violence in the uprising, known by the Arabic word intefadeh.
   ``I think that when students have something else to do _ not
just demonstrate _ it will decrease the intefadeh,'' she said.
   While the army ordered schools closed in the West Bank shortly
after the the uprising began, classes have continued for more than
150,000 students in the Gaza Strip. Colleges, universities and
vocational schools in both territories remain shut, affecting
20,000 students.

   Four bombs exploded at a Roman
Catholic university in the capital before dawn Saturday, wrecking a
print shop and a parked bus, officials said.
   Police experts also deactivated two more bombs in the print shop
at Simeon Canas Central American University, and officials there
said employees sleeping nearby narrowly escaped injury from the
blasts.
   A statement by the rector's office said no one claimed
responsibility for the attacks. One bomb exploded under the parked
bus and three more inside the print shop, causing part of the
building to collapse.
   ``The family of a watchman and three workers sleeping there
miraculously escaped unharmed, even though some the blasts were
only two yards away,'' the statement said.
   It said this was the latest of a ``a series of attacks'' on the
university, which is run by the Roman Catholic Church, and ``part
of an insidious campaign of incitement and slander against the
Jesuits who work at this institution.''
   President Alfredo Cristiani's conservative government and the
armed forces have often accused both the Central American
University and the University of El Salvador of being havens for
sympathizers of the leftist guerrilla movement fighting for power
for nearly 10 years.
   A bomb exploded at the Central American University's main
entrance gate April 29, but no one was hurt.
   A guerrilla group July 3 attacked a neighborhood near the
university where many army officers live, and some newspapers
sympathizing with the military said a number of shots were fired
from campus. The rector's office denied the accusation.
   Soldiers in battle gear have been ringing the University of El
Salvador for the past two months, searching anyone entering or
leaving the campus for weapons and guerrilla propaganda.
   On July 17, soldiers opened fire on a group of students rallying
for a protest demonstration on that campus, wounding eight people.
   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed since the civil war
began in October 1979.

<TEXT>
   Talks aimed at ending the nation's 14-year
civil war were suspended Saturday when the rebel delegation
requested consultations with their leaders about a proposal to
monitor a cease-fire, according to news reports.
   Reports on rebel-run Voice of the Black Rooster radio, monitored
in Luanda from the guerrillas' bush headquarters of Jamba, said the
rebels asked mediating President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire to allow
them one week of ``necessary consultations.''
   The talks, held in Kinshasa, Zaire's capital, started Wednesday.
It was the second session between the U.S.-backed rebels of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola and
representatives of Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
   According to reports in Kinshasa the talks are to resume on July
31.
   The reports said the rebels wanted to discuss Mobutu's proposals
for a ``hot line'' radio link between Luanda, Jamba and Kinshasa to
help monitor a June 24 cease-fire agreed to by rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi and dos Santos.
   The talks were held behind closed doors but reports from Zaire
said the government delegation, headed by armed forces chief
Antonio dos Santos Franca, accepted Mobutu's proposal.
   There was no immediate confirmation from the Angolan government
or the official media in Luanda.
   Dos Santos withdrew his delegation from the first round of talks
in Kinshasa on July 1, after only two days, claiming the rebels had
violated the truce.
   Reports of cease-fire violations continued as the second round
ended on Saturday.
   The Angolan state news agency, ANGOP, reported that an
unspecified number of civilians were killed, wounded or missing in
guerrilla attacks in four northern and central provinces.
   The rebels have said government forces also have violated the
cease-fire.
   Both sides also are at odds about what they agreed to in the
accord containing the cease-fire.
   The Angolan government claims Savimbi pledged to leave the
country temporarily, while members of his movement return to
civilian life.
   Savimbi has denied that he agreed to exile and rebel spokesmen
have rejected integration, calling instead for the formation of a
transitional government comprised of members from both sides to
prepare general elections.
   The rebels have been fighting to share control since a Marxist
government took power shortly after Angola's independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   The guerrillas have not explicitly stated their political and
economic philosophy, but they generally are pro-Western, favor a
multi-party democracy with regular elections and appear to support
a mixed economy.
   The United States sends military aid to the rebels. South Africa
also provided support until it signed a regional peace accord last
December that required a halt to the assistance.

<HEAD>Truce Signed in Guerrilla War in Suriname</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A guerrilla war in Suriname has
ended in a truce that will allow the rebels to keep their weapons
and eventually join the South American nation's police force, Dutch
newspapers reported Saturday.
   Suriname and the Jungle Commando rebels signed the truce Friday
in French Guiana. The accord calls for an end to fighting that
reportedly has killed hundreds of people in the country's eastern
regions over the last three years.
   The truce was immediately criticized by Suriname's army, which
ruled the former Dutch colony until 1987, the reports said.
   The accord, signed in Kourou, French Guiana, says the rebels
will not be disarmed but instead withdraw to three locations until
they are later enlisted in a special police unit, the Dutch reports
said.
   In a statement released after the signing ceremony, the
Surinamese army demanded the rebel group surrender its weapons and
said its police role would be ``unconstitutional,'' the reports
said. The army's approval of the truce is regarded as crucial to
its chances of succeeding.
   The rebels are led by Ronnie Brunswijk, 27, who served as a
bodyguard to Lt. Col. Desi Bouterse, when he was Suriname's
military ruler from 1980-1987. Bouterse yielded power to a civilian
government after elections two years ago, but the Dutch-trained
army still has considerable influence in Surinamese politics under
a state of emergency in large parts of the nation.
   Brunswijk agreed to a cease-fire in late 1987, but skirmishing
continued in the guerrilla war until last month.
   The truce also calls for an end to the state of emergency and
for an aid program for eastern Suriname, where Brunswijk has his
power base among the 65,000-member Bush Negro minority.
   The Brunswijk group was never more than 200 soldiers strong, but
it effectively controlled large areas of Suriname.
   By late 1986, the conflict had flared into a major guerrilla
war, with Brunswijk troops nearing Suriname's capital, Paramaribo.
The rebel cause was strengthened when government troops burned
several Bush Negro villages suspected of harboring rebels in
attacks that left at least 35 people dead.
   About 7,000 people, mostly Bush Negroes, fled eastern Suriname
to neighboring French Guiana during the insurgency. The Bush
Negroes are descendants of West African slaves brought to the
country by Dutch colonists.
   Brunswijk is a Bush Negro and a Cuban-trained soldier. He was
Bouterse's bodyguard until being fired in 1986.
   Details of their falling out are unknown, but the war was seen
as a personal feud between Brunswijk and the 42-year-old Bouterse.
   After his dismissal, Brunswijk is said to have taken weapons and
ammunition with him. He robbed banks and gave the money to his
people, gaining the reputation of a Robin Hood. But in June 1986,
Bouterse's army attacked Brunswijk's village, and the Jungle
Commando was born.

<HEAD>Andreotti One of Europe's Most Experienced Politicians</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Italy-Politics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's new premier is one of Western Europe's
master politicians, a man whose career embodies the nation's
political development since World War II.
   Giulio Andreotti, 70, who helped draft Italy's postwar
constitution, formed his sixth government and Italy's 49th postwar
government on Saturday.
   The Christian Democrat became part of the government in 1947 and
has been a constant member since, heading the ministries of
defense, treasury, finance, interior, industry, budget and, most
recently, the Foreign Ministry.
   The original Teflon politician, Andreotti has survived numerous
controversies and formal inquests. ``Power wears down whoever
doesn't have it,'' is one of his best-known phrases.
   He is known for his brilliance, his dry wit and his remarkable
grasp of issues. A stooped man with protruding ears, Andreotti also
a favorite target of Italian political cartoonists.
   Andreotti, a Roman Catholic with close ties to the Vatican, was
born to a Roman schoolteacher and his wife and earned a degree in
law at Rome University.
   During World War II he became a protege of Alcide de Gasperi,
who helped found the Christian Democrat party and became Italy's
foremost postwar statesman.
   At the age of 28, Andreotti became undersecretary of state,
beginning a long career that earned him the nickname ``minister for
life.'' He was elected to Parliament in 1946 and has been
continuously re-elected to his seat.
   Andreotti has been premier during some of Italy's most difficult
postwar days, when right- and left-wing terrorism plagued the
nation and the economy slid. On the day Andreotti formed his fourth
government, in 1978, Christian Democrat leader Aldo Moro was
kidnapped by the left-wing Red Brigades. Fifty-four days later, the
politician's body was found in a trunk.
   While Andreotti maintained the country's pro-American stance and
firm ties to NATO, he became the first Christian Democrat premier
to accept support from the Communists to keep his government
afloat. The Communists nearly overtook the Christian Democrats in
the late 1970s but have since lost much support.
   Andreotti's career has been marked by controversy. In September
1984, he caused an international furor by speaking out against a
possible reunification of East Germany and West Germany.
   Domestically, he has been cleared in numerous parliamentary
inquiries into charges against him ranging from corruption to
obstructing probes of a 1969 bomb attack thought to be the work of
right-wing terrorists.
   The author of several top-selling books on religious and
political issues, Andreotti also is an avid fan of the Roma
professional soccer team. His interests range from Latin to stamp
collecting.
   Andreotti is married to Livia Danese. They have four children.

   A moderately strong
earthquake shook buildings Saturday on an island in this
mid-Alantic archipelago, but no injuries were reported.
   Specialists at the Azores University Volcanology Center said the
quake measured 6 on the Mercalli scale, which gauges the intensity
of a temblor as felt in a specific location on a scale from 1 to 12.
   They said the quake's epicenter was near Lake Fogo about 15
miles from Sao Miguel Island's main town of Ponta Delgada.
   No injuries or serious damage were reported from the quake,
which occurred at 5 a.m.
   It was the most serious of more than 100 earth tremors on the
island in the past 10 days. Scientists believe the tremors are
related to volcanic activity in the area.
   The Azores lie near the North Atlantic Ridge, a seismically
active north-south line where two plates of the earth's crust are
pulling apart.
   A major earthquake hit the Azores in 1980, killing at least 49
people and injuring more than 300.

   Two East German men rammed their

   West German border police said a 20-year-old man managed to
climb out of the car and scale barriers to reach the West, but his

   Police said the man who reached West Germany suffered cuts and
bruises from climbing over the border fortifications.
   In another escape Saturday, a 24-year-old East Berlin border
guard left his post and fled to the West, West German authorities
said.
   Police said the soldier was clearing brush from a security zone
near the border when he bolted across.

<TEXT>
   Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin led
a parade Saturday through Johnson Space Center in the city whose
name was the first word ever spoken on the moon two decades ago.
   ``On July 20, 1969, men first stepped on the moon and made more
than footprints in history,'' Aldrin told space fans at a rally
beside what would have been Apollo 18, the giant Saturn 5 rocket
whose mission was scuttled by an expensive war in Vietnam.
   Aldrin, minus his fellow moon-walker of 20 years ago, Neil
Armstrong, was one of 14 Apollo astronauts who attended the
Saturday morning events commemorating the successful 1969 mission
and other past accomplishments and looking ahead to an expanded
program of space exploration.
   When men first landed on the moon July 20, 1969, Armstrong had
said: ``Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.''
   ``Since then, we've seen many triumphs and tragedies in our
quest in space,'' Aldrin said, stopping for applause from the large
crowds surrounding Rocket Park. ``And now, thanks to President
Bush, we continue to reach for the stars.''
   Bush, in his speech Thursday on the 20th anniversary of the
lunar landing, called for a continuing commitment to space
exploration.
   Several thousand people attended the parade and rally at Johnson
Space Center, where Aldrin and others thanked Houston and the
surrounding cities for their support of the space program.
   Crowds that lined streets for the space center's first public
parade waved American flags and cheered the astronauts who have
lived and worked in the Houston area, where the astronaut corps is
based.
   Hot air balloons lifted into the air and T-38 training jets flew
in formation over the festivities.
   Aldrin received a plaque with a footprint like the ones left on
the moon, and a child's handprint. It was enscribed, ``When we
touch the moon again.''
   ``Not unlike earthbound explorers and adventurers before us, we
search for yet-unknown treasures and try to unlock and understand
the mysteries of nature,'' Aldrin said. ``It is inherent in our
kind to strive for a better understanding of life and a richer
source of understanding.''
   Aldrin joined NASA's current chief astronaut, Capt. Dan
Brandenstein, in recognizing other astronauts and space program
contributors before and after the historic moon mission.
   On stage with Aldrin and Brandenstein were astronauts
representing missions Apollo 9 _ the first to reach lunar distance
_ through Apollo 17.
   ``The Apollo landing, as you're all well aware, was probably the
premier event in the last 20 years or better and we are proud to
have these men back with us today,'' Brandenstein said. ``However,
a program like the Apollo program takes a great deal of teamwork,
as do many of the other (NASA) programs.''
   Just as the Mercury and Gemini programs laid the groundwork for
Apollo and the trip to the moon, Apollo helped lay the base for the
shuttle era and the work on the space station, he said.

   Investigators said Saturday they had no leads
into why a hooded gunman burst into a church during a children's
Bible study graduation ceremony and shot three people, killing two.
   ``There's just no apparent reason why. I know the detectives
wish they knew so they knew where to turn,'' said police officer
Daniel Rueles.
   Police and residents of the area said there was no apparent
involvement by the gangs that have terrorized much of the city.
   ``There's a couple of gangs here but they haven't been active
lately,'' said Officer Steve Carlos as he and fellow patrolman Andy
Thedford kept watch on the shuttered Mount Olive Church of God in
Christ from their patrol car across the street.
   ``No gang threats, no retaliation, nothing,'' Thedford said.
   ``They don't cause trouble. They're never around,'' said Norma
Macias, 18, who lives across the street from the church. ``It's
kinda quiet here.''
   Two persons walked up to the church Friday night, according to
the police account. At least one of them shot at, but missed, a
passerby before one of them entered the building.
   He opened fire as about 50 adults and children were singing
hymns. The songs were the conclusion to a commencement ceremony for
a weeklong Bible study class.
   ``We were in the church singing a song. A man came in and he
started shooting,'' said 10-year-old Martha Lopez. ``I started
crying. I was scared.''
   Police identified the dead as Mae Lee, 76, and Patronella Luke,
35. Mrs. Luke's husband, Peter Luke, 33, suffered a gunshot wound
in the left knee and a superficial wound in the arm.
   Peter Luke was listed in stable condition Saturday at California
Medical Center, said hospital spokeswoman Grace Cheng. Luke
declined through hospital officials to speak to a reporter.
   A neighbor who declined to give her name said she heard gunshots
and looked out from her home to see a gunman crouching by the back
door of the church. Moments later, she said, a man carrying a
shotgun emerged through the door and the two ran off in different
directions.
   Witnesses said Mrs. Luke was shot point blank in the face and
Lee was hit as she tried to run for cover.
   Several people said Mrs. Luke was a professional singer who
recently had returned from a tour of Europe. She was attending the
commencement ceremony with her husband, 5-year-old son and other
family members.
   ``It's just senseless and crazy. This isn't a killing at all.
It's a crazy world we live in,'' said Officer Thedford, a 21-year
veteran. ``I'm going to buy me an apartment on the moon.''

<HEAD>Former Governor In Jail In Connection With Shiite Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Paksitan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired general and former
provincial governor during military rule in Pakistan was jailed
without bail Saturday in a year-old Shiite killing.
   Fazle Haq, an ally of the late military leader Mohammad Zia
Ul-Haq, was accused of conspiring to kill Arif Hussain Al-Husseini,
a moderate Shiite political leader who was gunned down in front of
a mosque in Peshawar on July 25, 1988.
   Zia died in a plane crash caused by sabotage in August 1988.
Benazir Bhutto was elected prime minister in November.
   Haq was allied with Zia when he overthrew Ms. Bhutto's father,
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in a bloodless coup in 1977. The government
had the elder Bhutto hanged two years later on charges of killing a
political foe.
   Haq accused Ms. Bhutto of seeking revenge for his part in her
father's fall from power. Her governing Pakistan People's Party
denied the charge.
   Al-Husseini led the Party for the Implementation of Shiite
Teachings. The majority of Pakistan's 107 million people belong to
the Sunni sect of Islam. A minority belong to the Shiite sect,
which predomintes in Iran.
   Haq was martial law administrator of Pakistan's Northwest
Frontier Province from 1979 to 1985 when Zia called non-party
elections and the civilian government of Prime Minister Mohammad
Khan Junejo was formed.
   Zia had promised elections within 90 days of his coup but it
wasn't until 1985 that they were finally held. After those
elections, Haq was named governor of the frontier province.
   When Zia dissolved his civilian government in 1987, Haq was
appointed a caretaker chief minister.

<HEAD>Boy Taken to Hospital After Glass Found in Candy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old boy was taken to a hospital
Saturday after he discovered glass in a bag of candy he had eaten,
and pieces of glass had been found in canned beans in a separate
case, authorities said.
   Police said the boy, who was not identified, later was released
from the hospital and was not believed to have eaten any of the
half-inch pieces of glass he found in his tube of ``Nerds'' candy,
a brand involved in a contamination scare in May.
   ``The pieces of glass were very noticeable,'' a police spokesman
in Dartford, southeast England, said on condition of anonymity.
   He said the store that sold the candy had removed other packages
from shelves but ``we are anxious to trace other packets.''
   In May, Nerds candies were removed from shelves throughout the
country after 130 reports of glass in packages. A cause for the
contamination was not found.
   In Barnsley, central England, six cans of baked beans have been
found since Friday to contain pieces of glass, said the
manufacturer, HP Foods Ltd. All were purchased at one supermarket.
   The company had withdrawn 100,000 cans and was investigating, a
spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He said no ransom notes
or demands for money had been received.
   Two major supermarket companies withdrew the baked beans from
their shelves, officials said.

   Tenor Jose Carreras, who fought off
leukemia with a bone marrow transplant in 1987, performed his first
opera since the operation Saturday, singing Cherubini's ``Medea''
in a sold-out ampitheater.
   It has been extremely hot in Merida, and Carreras reportedly
fainted several times during rehearsals. But he appeared to be fine
Saturday when he sang Jason's role opposite soprano Montserrat
Caballe as Medea.
   Four government ministers were in the audience, and Queen Sofia
was expected to attend one of two later performances, on Wednesday
and July 29.
   Organizers of the XXXV Merida Festival of Classic Theater said
all the seats in the 3,000-seat amphitheater in this western city
sold out the first day tickets went on sale. News reports said
scalpers had a field day.
   ``People have called us for tickets from all over the world,
South America, California, London and Switzerland,'' one ticket
official said.
   Carreras underwent bone marrow surgery Nov. 16, 1987, at the
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Wash.
   His first concert after the operation was in his hometown of
Barcelona in July 1988 and drew 150,000 wildly cheering fans.

<HEAD>American Airlines Plane Has Hydraulic Failure In Landing</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-DC-10 Crash, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Airlines flight bound for El
Paso, Texas, from Chicago lost one of its main hydraulic systems
Saturday, forcing the cockpit crew to manually lower the front
landing gear before landing safely here.
   The loss of the single hydraulic system on the Boeing 727 was
far less serious than the reported complete hydraulic failure of
United Airlines Flight 232 on Wednesday, said John Hotard,
spokesman for American Airlines in Fort Worth, Texas.
   The United DC-10 crashed in Sioux City, Iowa, killing at least
110 of the more than 295 people on board.
   ``Well for one thing, it's a different airplane,'' Hotard said.
``(The pilot) just had one of his systems failure and there are
several redundant systems on (the plane.)''
   Asked whether the failure of a single hydraulic system was
unusual, Hotard responded:
   ``Certainly it scared the hell out of us.'' But the pilot ``had
no trouble landing. He made a routine, perfect landing.''
   Flight 139 had 110 people on board, including the crew, and was
scheduled to make a stop at Tulsa International Airport at 1:12
p.m., The pilot radioed to the Tulsa control tower at 1:19 p.m.
that the jet was experiencing hydraulic problems and he couldn't
get the front landing gear down, Hotard said.
   ``There was a failure of what they call the System A hydraulics
system, and this among other things controls the raising and the
lowering of the landing gear,'' he said. ``And because this system
failed _ and we do not know yet why it failed _ the captain and the
cockpit crew had to hand-crank the right main landing gear. ...
It's not that difficult to do.
   ``When System A failed, System B took the backup for the other
sytems of the aircraft,'' Hotard said.
   There were no injuries reported in the incident.
   The plane, which was just over 40 miles northeast from Tulsa
International when it reported problems, landed at 1:58 p.m.,
Hotard said.
   The plane was towed to American's main maintanance facility. The
passengers traveling on to El Paso were taken on a separate
aircraft, Hotard said.
   The 727 will be overhauled and serviced to determine what caused
the hydraulic problem, he said.

<HEAD>Showers And Storms Sweep Much of The Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rumbled across much of the nation on Saturday,
sweeping through Arkansas, the lower Missouri Valley, the lower
Great Lakes and the upper Ohio Valley.
   A low pressure center in northeastern Missouri combined with a
couple weak upper-level weather systems moving southeast across
Oklahoma to create showers and thunderstorms.
   In Arkansas and the lower Missouri Valley, showers and
thunderstorms were developing early Saturday afternoon.
   Showers and thunderstorms moving along a warm front were
scattered through the lower Great Lakes region and the upper Ohio
Valley. The rain and storms also hit the southeastern United
States, mainly along the Gulf Coast and the southern Atlantic Coast.
   But the rest of the nation enjoyed dry weather, with clear skies
in the upper Mississippi Valley and the northwestern United States.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 2 p.m.
EDT included 1 2@3 inches at Kirksville, Mo. The storms dumped up
to 1 inch of rain Saturday morning throughout southern sections of
Kansas City.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Arcata and Crescent City, Calif., to 106 degrees at
China Lake, Calif.
   The low for the nation Saturday was 38 degrees at Baker, Ore.
   Sunday's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the southern Plains to the lower Great Lakes and the southern
and middle Atlantic Coast states, and from New Mexico and Arizona
to western Montana; numerous showers and thunderstorms from the
eastern and central Gulf Coast, in the middle Mississippi Valley,
and in northern and central Arizona; and sunny skies throughout the
rest of the nation.
   Sunday afternoon highs were forecast in the upper 80s and lower
90s in the southern and middle Atlantic Coast region; above 90
across much of Texas, much of the northern Plains and most of the
western United States; above 100 degrees in the southwestern
deserts; and in the 70s along the Pacific Coast.

   Wiseguys, knuckleheads and other fans of
Larry, Moe and Curly were whooping it up this weekend. Coitainly.
   ``Everybody's been a Stooge at one time in life and can relate
to it, from grandparents to youngsters'' said Phyllis Reighter, who
organized the third annual Three Stooges convention with her
husband, Frank, and Gary Lassin, head of the group's national fan
club.
   More than 900 people arrived Saturday for the two-day convention
in suburban Philadelphia. Last year, more than 1,500 fans spent two
days competing in the annual Curly sound-a-like contest, attending
movies and talking with people connected with the comedy team.
   Actress Sally Starr, who acted in the Stooges' last feature
film, ``The Outlaws is Coming'' in 1965, was at the conference,
Mrs. Reighter said.
   On Saturday, organizers held a Three Stooges memorabilia
auction, where fans could buy autographs of the three original
Stooges _ Moe Howard, Curly Howard and Larry Fine _ for $1,500.
   Mrs. Reighter said that although much of the Three Stooges work
is available on videotape, most of the fans were spending their
time Saturday in the convention hotel's theaters, ``nyuk-nyuk''ing
at the Stooges' 15-minute black-and-white comedy shorts.

   Texas ``the Friendship state?'' Maybe
``Don't Mess with Texas'' would do a better job of lassoing support
for a state license plate slogan.
   Texans, who pride themselves in their tough, cowboy image, say
having their state license plates read ``The Friendship State'' is
too wimpy. Now they just say ``Texas.''
   Callers on Friday inundated the Texas Department of Highways and
Public Transportation over the proposed change.
   ``I don't think the defenders of the Alamo would want to defend
those kinds of license plates,'' said Austin Police Sgt. Robert
Pewitt, who polled his colleagues and offered his opinion to the
highway department.
   It's not that Texans don't want to be known as friendly, Pewitt
said. ``We are friendly, but people will realize that when they get
here,'' he said.
   Lona Reeves, an information specialist with the highway
department, said she fielded 50 telephone calls during the first
three hours of the working day Friday. All were opposed to the
change, she said.
   ``All of them have been very polite. But one guy was very
uncalled for in his description of the new slogan. He said it was
too wimpy,'' Ms. Reeves said.
   Earlier this week, the Texas Highway Commission approved the
slogan for license plates beginning next spring.
   Officials said they wanted to put forth a less aggressive image
by using ``The Friendship State'' to promote tourism.
   ``We are surprised people are reacting the way they are,'' said
Mark Ball, an assistant to highway commission Chairman Robert
Dedman.
   Ball said the change was made partially in response to
complaints over the highway department's award-winning ``Don't Mess
With Texas'' anti-littering campaign.
   Although the ``Don't Mess With Texas'' slogan has been
successful, Ball said, highway officials continue to hear from a
contingent who say it is too tough.
   The commission voted 3-0 for the name change, but Ball noted
that in 1985 commissioners also voted 3-0 to change the license
plate to ``The Wildflower State.''
   After a public outcry, officials reversed themselves.

   Japanese voted Sunday in parliamentary elections in
which the governing conservatives were expected to lose ground to
the main opposition party because of stock and sex scandals and an
unpopular sales tax.
   Japan's 90.3 million eligible voters began casting ballots at 7
a.m. to fill half the seats in the 252-member upper house of
Parliament, known as the House of Councillors.
   Results in many districts were expected by 2 a.m. Monday (1 p.m.
Sunday EDT), but counting in Tokyo and some other large districts
will not begin until Monday, with final results expected by evening.
   On Saturday, Prime Minister Sousuke Uno attacked the rival
Socialist Party in a final campaign speech, while the Socialist
leader urged voters to ``make clear your disgust'' with Uno's
scandal-plagued government.
   A poor showing by Uno's conservative Liberal Democrats could
increase pressure on Uno, in office less than two months, to resign
and lead to early elections for the more powerful lower house of
Parliament.
   A Liberal Democratic loss there could bring Japan a
Socialist-led government, since the lower house elects the prime
minister.
   ``Socialism does not fit in Japan. Please help us defend freedom
in this country,'' Uno, 66, told several hundred workers of his
Liberal Democratic Party. He praised his party's record in raising
Japan's status in the world.
   Personally hobbled by allegations he kept paid mistresses, Uno
made few public appearances during the 18-day campaign and his last
was in a secluded parking lot at party headquarters.
   By contrast, Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Japan Socialist
Party, held her final campaign rally at a main intersection.
   ``Now is the time we can change politics, and the energy is
beginning to move,'' Ms. Doi said, assailing scandals and a new
sales tax. ``Tomorrow is your big chance to make clear your
disgust.''
   Polls, analysts and even many Liberal Democrats cast the
governing party as an underdog in the voting for 126 of the 252
seats in the House of Councilors. Recent polls by three major
national newspapers indicated the party would win only 30 to 42
seats, far short of the 54 it needs to maintain a simple majority.
   Final results are expected Monday evening.
   An upper house majority remains beyond the labor-backed
Socialists' reach, as they would need to win 84 seats and are
running only 54 candidates, with expectations of about 40 winners.
That would boost their overall total in the house from the current
43 to about 60.
   Thus they have led efforts to create an opposition coalition
with three other parties _ the No. 2 opposition Komeito (Clean
Government Party), the Democratic Socialists and the Socialist
Democratic Federation, which now has no seats in the upper chamber.
   A defeat would be a historic setback for the party that has
produced all of Japan's prime ministers and held majorities in both
houses since it was formed in 1955.
   Without control of the upper house, the Liberal Democrats would
find it awkward though not impossible to pass legislation.
   The popularity of the governing party began to erode last summer
with the first disclosures in a scandal that led to the
resignations of three Cabinet ministers and, ultimately, Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   The Recruit Co., a publishing conglomerate, was accused of
selling millions of dollars in underpriced stocks and making
political donations to obtain favors from politicians. With much of
its elite tainted by Recruit, the Liberal Democrats were unable to
select a new prime minister for more than one month.
   Shortly after Uno took office June 2, reports began to appear
that he had kept paid mistresses, igniting criticism from women's
groups. Uno has said he did nothing immoral.
   Meanwhile, the opposition rallied anti-government sentiment
against a 3 percent sales tax that took effect April 1, claiming it
created an unfair burden on lower-income households.
   The Liberal Democrats pushed a tax reform package, including the
new levy, through Parliament late last year over an opposition
boycott. In a nation where consensus is highly valued, the party
was criticized for ignoring opposition views.
   The opposition put forward a record number of women candidates
to win the votes of women who encountered the new tax in their
daily shopping.
   Farmers, an important source of Liberal Democratic support, also
revolted against government moves, made under strong pressure from
the United States, to open Japan's market wider to agricultural
products.
   A record 40 parties and 670 candidates are running Sunday.
Voters will elect 76 legislators in districts and another 50
nationwide. In the nationwide voting, voters write in the name of
the party they support, and the 50 seats are apportioned on the
basis of each party's percentage of the total vote.
   Though the Socialists are headed by a popular chairwoman, they
have been widely accused of lacking a realistic and unified
platform, partly because of a small but powerful radical left wing.
   In the past they have called for Japan to disband its
Self-Defense Forces and scrap the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, under
which about 64,000 American troops are stationed in Japan.
   Socialist leaders, when pressed, say they would not immediately
do away with the armed forces and seek only to revise the treaty.
But Ms. Doi and others have said on several occasions that all
American warships entering Japanese ports should be carefully
inspected and denied entry if nuclear arms are found aboard.

   Rose Kennedy celebrated her 99th
birthday Saturday night with roses, Irish tunes, chocolate cake and
her great granddaughter, Rose Kennedy Schlossberg, age 1.
   More than three dozen members of the Kennedy clan gathered at
the family compound on Cape Cod for the celebration, which included
a special Mass and Mrs. Kennedy's favorite cake.
   A pianist played the Irish tunes she loves, including ``Sweet
Adeline,'' which was the theme song of her father, former
congressman and Boston mayor John F. ``Honey Fitz'' Fitzgerald.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy presented his mother with 99 pink roses
and a note ``to the rose of all roses and the greatest mother of
them all.''
   Mrs. Kennedy is the mother of a nine children, including slain
president John F. Kennedy and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. She can no
longer walk, and her vision is poor, but she is still alert, her
doctors said.
   Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of the Boston Archdiocese,
visited Mrs. Kennedy earlier in the day, and her daughter-in-law,
Ethel, took her for a walk in her wheelchair along the compound
drive.
   Family spokeswoman Melody Miller said Mrs. Kennedy's seat for
the birthday celebration was in the center of the room, next to the
piano, so she could see all her grandchildren and great
grandchhildren and hear everything.
   Mrs. Kennedy's former doctor, Robert Watt, attributed her
longevity to prudent living _ she does not drink or smoke and has
always watched her diet _ and personal strength. Her mother also
lived well into her 90s.
   Michael Kennedy, 31, the son of Robert Kennedy, said last week
that his grandmother's long life stems from her faith.
   ``I think it's in the genes. I just hope I have it also.''

<HEAD>Detective Agency Hired to Find Address, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man charged with stalking and killing
actress Rebecca Schaeffer hired a Tucson detective agency to find
her address in Los Angeles, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Police in Los Angeles confirmed that the firm of Anthony Agency,
Investigators, contacted them after learning of the death of Miss
Schaeffer, co-star of the defunct CBS television series ``My Sister
Sam,'' the Arizona Daily Star reported.
   Miss Schaeffer, 21, was shot once in the chest when she answered
the door of her apartment Tuesday morning. The actress also
appeared in the current film ``Scenes From the Class Struggle in
Beverly Hills.''
   Sources who asked not to be identified told the newspaper that
Robert John Bardo, 19, the defendant, hired the agency less than a
month ago.
   Officials of the agency could not be reached for comment Friday,
the Star said, but it was reported in the Los Angeles Daily News
that the agency could not find Miss Schaeffer and ``had to farm it
out to somebody else.''
   Sources here said no other agency in Tucson or California was
involved, the paper said.
   Bardo was arrested Wednesday after darting into traffic on
Interstate 10 in Tucson. His court-appointed attorney said Thursday
that he had decided to fight extradition to California.
   Bardo, who is on probation for an April domestic violence
misdemeanor conviction, is being held in the Pima County Jail on $1
million bond and is under a suicide watch.
   Police believe Bardo was trying to kill himself when he darted
into traffic.
   Bardo, a unemployed restaurant janitor, was identified as the
man near Miss Schaeffer's apartment before and after the shooting.
In addition, police in Los Angeles found a shirt and a paperback
book Bardo told investigators he threw away when running down an
alley near Schaeffer's apartment.

   CBS' Western miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' was
named best program of the year and best drama, and CBS' ``Murphy
Brown'' was named best comedy by the Television Critics Association.
   A career achievement award was also presented posthumously to
Lucille Ball by the 120-member association, which is meeting here
to preview network, cable and syndicated programming for the coming
TV season. The awards were presented Friday night.
   CBS spokesman Axel Petersen accepted the awards for ``Lonesome
Dove,'' the critically acclaimed eight-hour miniseries based on
Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.
   ``Something like this comes along once in a blue moon,'' said
Petersen. ``We're glad it was on CBS, because it came along just at
the right time.''
   CBS, in third place for the second season in a row, got a morale
boost from the high-rated miniseries.
   Diane English and Joel Shukovsky, executive producers of
``Murphy Brown,'' and cast member Charles Kimbrough, were on hand
to accept their award.
   ``This is truly probably one of the best ones of these we could
get, having been a critic myself,'' said English, who formerly
wrote about television for Vogue magazine. ``Having your support
sometimes gives us a second chance when we really need it.''
   Petersen accepted the career achievement award on behalf of
Lucille Ball.
   The other honorees Friday night included ``What's Alan
Watching?'' as best special; ``The Jim Henson Hour,'' which was
canceled by NBC, as best children's program; Cable News Network for
best news and information for the second year in a row; and NBC's
coverage of the Summer Olympics for best sports programming.

<HEAD>Las Vegas Sun Founder Hank Greenspun Dead At 79</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Ruthe in 2nd graf is cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Herman M. ``Hank'' Greenspun, founder of the
Las Vegas Sun newspaper, a one-time gunrunner and political
activist, died Saturday after a battle with cancer. He was 79.
   Greenspun, who had been ill for more than a year, died at home,
said Ruthe Deskin, a longtime employee and assistant to the
newspaper publisher.
   A gunrunner for a Jewish self-defense organization that helping
establish the nation of Israel, Greenspun challenged some of the
nation's most famous people in his newspaper, which had a
circulation of 99,000.
   His ``Where I Stand'' column was a front-page fixture of the
morning newspaper from its inception and he used the platform to
promote a variety of different causes.
   Greenspun gained national attention in the 1950s when his
newspaper went to war with Sen. Joseph McCarthy. He was charged
with _ and later acquitted of _ publishing and mailing matter
``tending to incite murder or assassination.''
   The incident arose over a newspaper column predicting the
assassination of McCarthy by one of the people he bullied, and
recommending he commit suicide first.
   Greenspun was closely allied with Howard Hughes in the 1960s
when the eccentric billionaire holed up in Las Vegas and bought a
television station from Greenspun and several hotel-casinos.
   ``Hank was courageous, compassionate and had knowledge we all
seek but seldom gain,'' said former Gov. Mike O'Callaghan, chairman
of the board of the Sun.
   Greenspun, born Aug. 27, 1909, in Brooklyn, N.Y., was the son of
immigrants and, on both sides, the grandson of Jewish refugees from
Russian-dominated Poland.
   He came to Las Vegas in 1946 to open a short-lived entertainment
magazine, and later became a press agent for the Flamingo Hotel,
which was built and run by the gangster ``Bugsy'' Siegel.
   Greenspun soon quit the Flamingo and invested in a small, rival
hotel-casino, The Desert Inn, where he also became publicity
director. His interest in the hotel, originally substantial, was
eventually reduced to 1 percent.
   Greenspun began his newspaper career by buying an eight-page
tri-weekly that was started by the International Typographical
Union in a dispute with the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The small
paper grew to become the Sun.
   In late 1947, Greenspun was recruited by Haganah, the Jewish
self-defense organization which had been formed in British-held
Palestine. Greenspun helped run guns to Palestine, which was to
become the nation of Israel in 1948.
   As a consequence, in 1950, he pleaded guilty to violating the
neutrality act, and was fined $10,000.
   In 1961, Greenspun's felony conviction was pardoned by President
John Kennedy, enabling him to run in 1962 for the Republican
gubernatorial nomination. He lost the race.

<HEAD>Appellate Court Upholds Death Sentence for Confessed Communist Agent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court upheld a lower court
conviction Saturday and sentenced a confessed North Korean agent to
death for the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed
all 115 people on board.
   Kim Hyon-hui, 27, was convicted of violating national security
and criminal and aviation laws.
   She showed little sign of emotion and looked down when Senior
Judge Lee Young-il sentenced her to death by hanging.
   Government officials have indicated privately, however, that she
would be pardoned even if the verdict is upheld through the Supreme
Court.
   Several relatives of victims of the bombing cried and shouted
insults when Ms. Kim, clad in white jacket and pants, was escorted
by two female security guards into the packed courtroom.
   ``Bring back my son. Why did you kill my innocent son?'' one
woman shouted.
   Hundreds of security guards surrounded the courtroom and checked
all people to prevent violent protests by relatives or a possible
North Korean threat to Ms. Kim.
   The judge described the bombing as ``atrocious and unethical.''
   The defense counsel had argued that Ms. Kim should be given a
lighter sentence because, they said, she was duped by North Korean
leaders. Defense lawyer Ahn Dong-il said his client will decide
whether to appeal to the Supreme Court within a week, as required
by law.
   Ms. Kim admitted at several hearings to bombing a Korean Air
Boeing 707 that disappeared near Burma on Nov. 29, 1987, on a
flight from Baghdad, Iraq to Seoul. All 115 people on board died.
   Ms. Kim told the court that she had planted two bombs, disguised
as a radio and a liquor bottle, on the plane on orders from Kim
Jong Il, son and heir to North Korean President Kim Il Sung, to
disrupt preparations for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. The
Olympics were successfully held with a record 160 nations taking
part.
   Communist North Korea had denied involvement in the incident and
said the bombing was committed by South Korea to embarrass the
North. The nations have been bitter rivals since their land was
divided in 1945. They fought the three-year Korean War in 1950-53.
   In a nationally televised news conference last year, Kim said
she and another North Korean male agent planted the bomb on the
plane when they flew from Baghdad to Abu Dhabi, where they got the
craft.
   The two were arrested in Bahrain a few days later and took
poison hidden in cigarettes. The man died but Ms. Kim survived and
was later extradited to Seoul.

   About 3,000 supporters of the National
Organization for Women marched through crowded downtown streets
Saturday and vowed to pressure lawmakers to support a women's right
to an abortion.
   About 300 anti-abortion demonstrators lined sidewalks along the
route, exchanging chants with the NOW marchers. Police on horseback
stayed between the groups and reported no incidents or citations.
   In Michigan, Southern California, Ohio, Massachusetts and New
Jersey, meanwhile, police arrested more than 300 anti-abortion
demonstrators during protests at abortion clinics.
   The NOW throng, in Cincinnati for the organization's annual
convention, stretched for more than three blocks, tying up traffic
and temporarily stopping music enthusiasts listening to a downtown
jazz festival.
   A recent Supreme Court ruling giving states authority to
regulate and limit abortions was the focus of both the NOW marchers
and anti-abortion demonstrators.
   ``If our elected officials are not pro-choice, then they will
not be elected,'' Cincinnati NOW chapter President Shirley Rosser
told the rally. ``I want you to realize: No matter how good they
are on other issues, if they're not right on the issue of choice,
they will be defeated.''
   ``This whole thing is going back to the state legislatures, the
political arena,'' said Joseph Scheidler, executive director of the
Chicago-based Pro-Life Action League, who was one of the
anti-abortion protesters at the rally. ``I think it's going to be
the issue. They (politicians) know it, and they dread it.
   Although delegates at the NOW conference addressed various
issues related to women and civil rights, abortion took center
stage. The conference, attended by more than 1,000 delegates, runs
through Sunday.
   Before the march, NOW President Molly Yard said the organization
is developing legislation to prevent states from restricting the
rights of women to have abortions. She also announced a ``freedom
caravan'' to various state capitals and a Nov. 12 rally in
Washington, D.C., to show support for legalized abortion.
   Ms. Yard said participation in the 200,000-member NOW has grown
in recent weeks as women, angered by the U.S. Supreme Court's July
3 ruling on abortion, joined the ranks.
   In Salinas, Calif., 109 anti-abortion protesters were arrested
after blocking the entrance of a Planned Parenthood clinic in a
demonstration police described as generally peaceful.
   Those arrested in the Operation Rescue protest were taken to the
Monterey County jail, where they were booked for investigation of
trespassing and resisting officers, both misdemeanors, said police
Lt. Scott Miller.
   In the Boston area, police said 74 anti-abortion demonstrators
were arrested in two protests at abortion clinics.
   Elsewhere, in the Boston suburb of Brookline, police arrested 38
people when Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, set up
blockades at three abortion clinics.
   At least 36 anti-abortion demonstrators also were arrested after
they blocked the entrance to an abortion clinic adjacent to the
Boston Common, police said.
   Police in Lansing, Mich., arrested 59 of about 150 anti-abortion
protesters at two clinics on charges of trespassing and
obstruction, police and demonstrators said.
   In Cleveland, police arrested more than 30 anti-abortion
protesters on criminal trespassing and aggravated disorderly
conduct charges during a demonstration at the National Health Care
Services clinic.
   About 175 anti-abortion protesters in Bordentown City, N.J.,
forced the closure of an abortion clinic Saturday morning by
blocking its entrances and telling would-be patients not to undergo
the procedure, police said.
   Two of the demonstrators affiliated with New Jersey Central Area
Rescue Effort were arrested and charged with trespassing, police
said.

   A high school senior from Missouri was named
America's Young Woman of the Year Saturday night, capturing the
$30,000 scholarship that comes with the title.
   ``It's more than I ever could wish for,'' said 18-year-old
Kristin Huxhold of Kirkwood, gushing tears. ``At first I didn't
think it was me. I am so shocked.''
   Miss Huxhold, whose parents both teach high school, was one of
50 teen-age contestants in the stage production. She also won a
$500 award for her interview with the panel of judges. She plans a
career in education and singing.
   Her mother, Sonja Huxhold-Nold, said Miss Huxhold plans to
attend the University of Illinois this fall. ``We were wondering
how we would pay for it,'' her mother said. ``Her first love is to
become a vocal performer.''
   The first runner-up was 17-year-old Lara Michell of Winchester,
Ore., who plans to become an attorney. An accomplished pianist,
Miss Michell claimed a $15,000 scholarship, plus a $500 award for
her interview with the judges.
   The second runner-up was California's Gretchen Handel, 18, of
Shafter, who received a $10,000 scholarship. She also hopes to
become a lawyer.
   The Young Woman of the Year contest formerly was America's
Junior Miss until the name was changed this year in a bid to
attract new sponsors to the 32-year-old event.
   The candidates are selected in statewide competitions in all 50
states. The judges' scores are based on scholastic achievement, and
personal interviews, among other things.

   A recent verdict reviving the historic Brown
vs. Topeka Board of Education case was withdrawn without
explanation by a federal appeals court in Denver, baffling both
sides in the case.
   Attorneys for both sides said they found out about the decision
Friday and said they were unsure what the unusual action by the
court means for the Topeka school system.
   ``We're in the same position now as if no opinion had ever been
filed,'' said Robert Hoecker, clerk of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Denver.
   In 1987, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Rogers of Topeka
ruled that Topeka's public school district had no illegal,
intentional, systematic or residual separation of races.
   In June, the appeals court overturned Rogers' ruling. It said
the Topeka school system had not done enough to overcome remnants
of the segregated school system that existed before the U.S.
Supreme Court decided the landmark Brown vs. Topeka Board of
Education case in 1954.
   The appeals court ordered Rogers to devise a remedy for what it
called the racially identifiable public schools in Topeka.
   Topeka lawyers involved in the case said the new opinion they
found out about Friday was brief, stating without explanation that
the appeals court had withdrawn its opinion and vacated last
month's judgment in the case.
   ``No one seems to know exactly what this means,'' Topeka
Superintendent Gary Livingston said. ``We'll be meeting with our
counsel next week to try to filter out what the implications are.''
   Individuals on both sides of the case said all they could do was
wait for another decision from the appeals court.
   Charles Henson, an attorney for Topeka's Board Of Education,
said the action Friday meant the case would still have to be
reviewed by the court.
   ``My understanding is that this has the effect of restoring the
case as a pending one before the 10th Circuit Court,'' Henson said.
``The effect of this order is to say that Rogers' opinion is still
pending, or that the appeal has not been decided. As to what will
happen next, we'll just have to wait and see.''
   Rich Jones, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the court had
been asking for several records from the U.S. District Court in
Topeka during the last few weeks.
   ``When I got this letter (Friday), it looked like an order
asking for another record. And lo and behold, it said they were
withdrawing from the decision made June 2,'' he said.
   The 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education case struck down as
unconstitutional the concept of ``separate but equal'' public
schools for different races.
   The case was reopened in 1979 when the parents of 17 black
Topeka public school children sought a decision on whether the
schools had eliminated traces of the segregated system.
   The group contended the district had not eliminated vestiges of
segregation. The parents included Linda Brown Buckner, who as a
student in 1954 gave the landmark case its name.
   The parents had pointed to seven elementary schools and one
middle school that they said had a disproportionately high number
of minority students.

<HEAD>Report Ties Former Massachusetts Senator To Pierce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of Housing Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
intervened with a client of former Massachusetts Sen. Edward W.
Brooke to get a HUD project approved, according to a published
report.
   The New York Times reported in Sunday newspapers that Brooke,
who was well known as a housing specialist while in the Senate, in
1985 was promoting a Boston engineering and management firm, Paul
Parks &amp; Associates.
   The firm, headed by Parks, a Democrat who is a former state
Education Secretary in Massachusetts, in 1986 and 1987 received
more than $400,000 in financing from a discretionary fund
maintained by Pierce, the paper said.
   Brooke told the Times that he recalled helping Parks in his
application to HUD.
   Brooke wrote in a Nov. 5, 1985 letter to Pierce, ``Thank you for
your personal attention to the Paul Parks &amp; Associates proposal,
for which he and I are grateful.''
   But Brooke told the Times he did not recall what role, if any,
was played by Pierce in awarding the money.
   The newspaper quoted Parks as saying he was unaware of the
letter but was not surprised it was sent to Pierce.
   ``Eddie may have written to the Secretary on my behalf because,
as I say, we're personal friends,' he said. ``I appreciate him
doing that, but I can assure you it was purely a thing of letting
Pierce know that we are friends.''
   In April, a HUD audit showed Brooke had received $183,000 from
clients seeking assistance under the Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation Program.
   The program was intended to encourage developers to rehabilitate
low-income housing. It was suspended for a time earlier this year
because of allegations of widespread political favoritism.
   A telephone call made to a listing for Brooke in Washington,
D.C., was not answered Saturday night.

<TEXT>
   A rancher from Indiana who has been
accused of links to drug trafficking and the Iran-Contra scandal is
an honorable man, one of his lawyers said Friday.
   A Costa Rican congressional commission investigating drug
trafficking and money laundering recommended Thursday that rancher
John Hull be stripped of his citizenship and expelled from the
country.
   ``Eventually we will show that he is an honorable man,'' said
Rita Herrera, one of Hull's lawyers, in a telephone interview. She
refused to comment further.
   A person who answered the telephone at Hull's residence said he
was not talking to reporters on the advice of both his doctors and
lawyers.
   Hull, 69, is from Evansville, Ind. He has been living in Costa
Rica for two decades and says he became a naturalized citizen seven
years ago.
   The congressional commission also recommended that President
Oscar Arias' administration bar from the country former Marine Lt.
Col. Oliver North and any other person involved in the Iran-Contra
scandal, including former U.S. National Security Adviser John
Poindexter, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, and
Lewis Tambs, former ambassador to Costa Rica.
   The commission report said that ``certain American authorities
had permitted the shipment of cocaine to the United States through
Costa Rica with the object of channeling illegal funds to the
Nicaraguan counterrevolution.''
   North was a leader in a covert effort to aid the Nicaraguan
Contra guerrillas fighting the leftist Sandinista government in
Managua at a time when such aid had been prohibited by the U.S.
Congress.
   The commission's voluminous report also revealed a scandal
involving another American and a former president of Costa Rica and
a number of other high government officials.
   Hull has been indicted in Costa Rica on charges of drug
trafficking and violating state security, but no trial date has
been set. Hull pleaded innocent and was released on $37,500 bail
after his doctors said he had suffered a heart attack.
   Planes secretly landed at Hull's hillside ranch near the
northern town of Muelle San Carlos to smuggle weapons from 1984 to
1985 to U.S.-supported Contra rebels fighting in southern
Nicaragua, according to allegations in court.
   The planes also allegedly ferried drugs out of the country to be
sold in the United States to pay for the weapons.
   North, a former National Security aide, and several of the other
American officials visited Costa Rica to give Hull and the Contras
instructions, in complicity with Benjamin Piza, the Costa Rican
Public Security Minister at the time, the commission's report said.
   The commission recommended that Piza be censured and barred from
holding any public job for life.
   The commission also recommended that Arias force former
President Daniel Oduber to return $12,000 in contributions that
another American, Lionel Casey Brothers, made to the 1981 election
campaign of President Luis Alberto Monge.
   The American gave the money to Oduber, who was in office from
1972 to 1976, the commission said. Oduber testified before the
commission that he had given the money to the National Liberation
Party treasury. The party has made no comment on the matter.
   Brothers, who has been living in Costa Rica for 10 years, is
awaiting extradition to the United States to face drug trafficking
charges.
   The commission also recommended that current laws be changed to
lift banking secrecy on all accounts containing more than $5,000
and that foreigners be forbidden to contribute to election
campaigns in Costa Rica.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. James M. Collins, one of the
first congressmen to speak out against the Nixon administration's
conduct in the Vietnam War, died Friday of heart and lung problems.
He was 73.
   Collins, a Republican, represented the 3rd Congressional
District in affluent north Dallas from 1968 until he lost a bid for
the U.S. Senate in 1982.
   President Bush telephoned the former congressman from Europe
earlier this month to wish him well. Several other national
political leaders also offered get-well messages, including Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, a Democrat, who beat Collins in the 1982 Senate race.
   Parkland Hospital spokeswoman Sue Mundell said Collins arrived
at the hospital July 11 experiencing breathing difficulties. Ms.
Mundell said he suffered from pulmonary fibrosis, described as
pneumonia with underlying lung problems.
   In 1972, Collins became the central figure in the trial of his
former top congressional aide who was convicted in connection with
an $18,000 kickback and payroll-juggling scheme. The former aide,
George A. Haag, claimed Collins devised the scheme, but the
congressman contended he knew nothing about the kickbacks and
payroll manipulations in his office.
   Haag was found guilty of all 23 charges of mail fraud and using
fraudulent House pay forms for the kickbacks and one count of
getting an ex-employee to lie to a federal grand jury to cover up
the scheme.
   Collins was never charged.
   Born April 29, 1916, Collins attended Southern Methodist
University and earned graduate degrees from Northwestern University
and Harvard Business School, where he was class president.
   He served in the Army, receiving the Medal of Metz and four
battle stars for bravery. Collins also was involved in front-line
combat with Hitler's army in World War II.
   He later became president of Fidelity Union Life, which he
transformed into a major national insurance company that sold for
$300 million in 1978.
   He was known in Congress as an ardent fiscal conservative.

   Opposition politicans said Friday
they will hold more demonstrations to demand that their candidates
in the May elections be allowed to take office on schedule in
September.
   ``We are willing to go to the front and take the risks and
consequences of these acts,'' said Guillermo Endara, the opposition
presidential candidate in May 7 elections.
   The announcement came a day after the Organization of American
States called for a democratic transfer of power on Sept. 1,
followed by new elections. The decision in effect accepts Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega's nullification of the May balloting.
   International observers said Endara's slate won the election by
a 3-1 margin. They said Noriega, head of the Panamanian Defense
Forces and the nation's de facto ruler, had the balloting annulled
when it became apparent his candidate, Carlos Duque, was losing.
   The OAS mediated talks between the government and opposition
last weekend, but the opposition discounted the organization after
it announced its position on the political standoff.
   ``We should stop experimenting with international solidarity,''
Endara said. ``We, the Panamanians, are the only ones responsible
for our own destiny.''
   He said the opposition had been assured that the OAS mediation
``was something marvelous; but since it hasn't turned out to be
something marvelous, since it has not known how to grasp our
problem, we simply have to tell them goodbye and follow our own
path.''
   He did not say when the public protests would begin or what form
they would take.
   Opposition demonstrations, held frequently for several weeks in
1988 to demand that Noriega leave, often were broken up by riot
police using rubber truncheons and water cannons that sprayed a mix
of water and tear gas.
   After the May election, thugs beat opposition protesters,
injuring Endara and one of his vice presidential candidates,
Guillermo Ford.
   The current presidential term expires Sept. 1. Manuel Solis
Palma has been acting president since Noriega had Eric Arturo
Delvalle fired in February 1988, a day after Delvalle had tried to
oust the general.
   Earlier that month, Noriega was indicted in the United States on
drug trafficking charges. Noriega denies the charges and has
resisted U.S. political and economic pressure to force him to step
down.
   An OAS mission began working in mid-July to try to resolve the
crisis. The talks last weekend were the first between the two sides
since the election.
   Endara said opposition officials will meet soon to decide
whether to continue negotiating with the government.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Authorities Friday seized 1,100
pounds of Colombian cocaine with an estimated street value of $9
million and arrested two men, the independent station Radio
Metropole reported.
   The drug haul, in the town of Jeremie on Haiti's southwest tip,
was the biggest this year in the Caribbean nation, officials said.
   The Haitian Narcotics Bureau, assisted by local soldiers,
arrested Jean-Claude Jean and Mimose Gentille, both accused of drug
smuggling, the radio station reported. A third suspect escaped,
according to the report.
   Jean also was accused of trying to pay a $4,000 bribe to an air
force soldier, Radio Metropole said. The radio report said Gentille
was arrested in April on drug charges and released.
   A drug smuggling conviction carries a 15-year prison term.
   U.S authorities say Haiti is a key transfer point in the
narcotics trade between Colombia and the United States.
   The radio report did not say where the drugs were seized. Drugs
shipped to Haiti generally come in by boat, are flown out by small
aircraft to the Bahamas and then shipped to Miami.

   A man who once worked as a press aide to two
members of Congress has been charged with robbing two suburban
banks, it was learned Friday.
   Thomas Springer, 40, was charged Thursday with three counts of
armed robbery, two of the Maryland National Bank in Bethesda, Md.,
Montgomery County police said.
   He was arrested Thursday morning in a wooded area near the bank
shortly after what police said was the second robbery.
   Police spokesman Sgt. Harry Geehreng said a man carrying a box
entered the bank about 10:30 a.m. and handed a teller a note saying
that he had a bomb and wanted money. The man fled with an
undisclosed amount of cash through a back door.
   A customer chased the bandit, but lost him. A police dog later
located him and the money and an empty box were recovered, Geehreng
said.
   Springer, of Silver Spring, Md., was also was charged with
robbing the same branch on April 14 and a Crestar Bank branch in
Bethesda on May 12, police said.
   He was held in the Montgomery County jail in lieu of $50,000
bond.
   Springer was a longtime press secretary to Rep. Toby Roth,
R-Wis., the congressman said Friday.
   Springer left his press job in 1987, but was later given a
temporary assignment in the office, a Roth aide said.
   Roth said he gave Springer the temporary job ``because I felt
sorry for him,'' but that Springer then failed to show up for work.
   ``I am deeply saddened,'' Roth said, but added he was not
surprised. Roth said Springer's ``behavior had deteriorated,'' in
recent years.
   Springer also worked for Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J., on a
temporary basis, according to a statement from Rinaldo.
   ``Tom Springer worked here for a very short time and while he
was here his work was satisfactory,'' the statement said.
   A Rinaldo spokesman said Springer was a press assistant for
about six months last year.

left Indian leaders debating whether to legalize the casinos as a
revenue source.
   The community of Akwesasne on the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation
has been closed to non-residents since Thursday morning when 225
state troopers and FBI agents raided five casinos. The officers
confiscated an undetermined amount of cash and financial records
and arrested 10 people.
   It was the second crackdown in two months and the first
involving federal authorities on gambling at the reservation, which
straddles the St. Lawrence River along the U.S.-Canadian border.
Illegal casinos on the reservation employ about 500 people and
attract busloads of gamblers, authorities say.
   State Police Maj. Ronald Brooks said he was not sure when the
blockade would be lifted. He said police continued to restrict
access to the reservation because of the potential for violence or
hostage-taking.
   The Mohawks' reservation security force also continued to
maintain roadblocks Friday. Indians piled up logs on a state road
through the reservation and at other points used an overturned
flatbed trailer and a gas tanker to block the route.
   Art Montour, a spokesman for the security force, said the
confrontation might drag on for weeks.
   ``It has got to be resolved. Either they (police) drop the H
bomb, or they have to make some concessions,'' he said.
   Although police said the situation on the reservation was
volatile, a woman who answered the phone at the tribal council
office said the atmosphere was relaxed.
   ``Everybody's just going about their business,'' she said,
declining to give her name.
   A special tribal meeting was held Friday to discuss a possible
gaming ordinance for the reservation.
   Lincoln White, one of three tribal chiefs on the American side
of the reservation, said tribal leaders voted overwhelmingly to
hold a referendum July 29 on whether to legalize some forms of
gambling.
   White, a proponent of keeping the reservation's casinos in
business, said the plan would allow bingo, card games like poker
and blackjack, and roulette in Indian gaming houses. It would not
allow slot machines, he said.
   John Brunetti, a spokesman for the U.S. magistrate's office in
Syracuse, said the tribe could approve some forms of gambling, such
as bingo, but not slot machines and other gambling machines that
were the target of the raid.
   Tony Laughing, owner of Tony's Vegas International, predicted
reservation residents would authorize gambling in a referendum.
   Laughing's casino was among those authorities planned to raid
Thursday. However, police were unable to locate Laughing and an
armed group of about 15 Mohawks prevented police from entering his
building and the Bear's Den, another casino. Bear's Den owner Eli
Tarbell also eluded police.
   Laughing said casino owners have agreed to turn over as much as
60 percent of their profits to the tribe. He estimated the
reservation's seven casinos could add between $2 million and $3
million to the tribe's coffers.

   A sweeping, round-the-clock crackdown along a major Maine to
Florida highway known as a drug corridor was called a success
Friday, but drug arrests were not as abundant as police had hoped.
   Almost 10,800 traffic citations were issued for offenses from
speeding to drunken driving during the 24-hour crackdown along
Interstate 95, police said.
   But the number of drug seizures and arrests numbered was much
lower.
   The International Association of Chiefs of Police, which
organized the operation, said in a statement Friday the operation
was the first time every state traversed by a specific highway
committed resources for a coordinated operation.
   The Washington, D.C.-based organization said 10,799 traffic
citations were issued and 100 drunken drivers were arrested. In
addition, 297 criminal arrests were made with 570 charges filed,
including 355 drug-related charges.
   ``This was a pioneer effort,'' the statement said. ``The numbers
achieved during the 24-hour operation likely mean that other
corridors in other states will be candidates for similar saturation
programs.''
   In drug arrests, 65,876 grams of marijuana, 5,671 grams of
cocaine and 340 grams of crack were seized, but police said they
had hoped to nab more drug traffickers. They said they believed
drug dealers were aware of the sweep, which ended Friday morning.
   ``It's doubtful anything was moving,'' said Georgia State Patrol
spokesman J.D. Coleman. ``It could have been the publicity ... or
they just all drove very safely.
   ``You always hope for a magnificent seizure on the highway,''
Coleman said. ``But we took some dangerous drivers off the highway;
maybe we saved some lives. That's the bottom line.''
   The effort was named ``Operation CoFlaMe'' because it was a
cooperative operation that ran from Florida to Maine.
   During the dragnet, a few stolen cars were recovered and
fugitives captured. A Jacksonville, Fla., man was jailed on drug
trafficking charges and Virginia state troopers seized 140 pounds
of marijuana from one traveler.
   In Virginia, 37 people were arrested on various criminal charges
and 2,461 traffic citations were issued, said state police
spokeswoman Mary Evans.
   Twenty-eight of the arrests were drug related, she said. Eight
people were charged with driving while impaired.
   Among the drug arrests was John P. Demorest, 40, of New Haven,
Conn., who was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to
distribute after police seized 140 pounds from his vehicle, said
Virginia State Patrol Lt. W.L. Bowman.
   During other stops, officers seized four grams of cocaine and
two grams of crack, a potent cocaine derivative, Ms. Evans said.
   In Georgia, troopers issued 484 traffic citations, 310 of which
were speeding tickets and 21 for drunken driving. In 20
drug-related arrests, officers seized 380 grams of marijuana, a
gram of crack cocaine, ``a fraction of a kilo'' of cocaine and
$1,526 in currency, Coleman said.
   ``For Georgia, it was not a major drug thing,'' he said.
   Officers arrested five people at a rural Georgia weigh station
and recovered a stolen car carrying luxury car parts.
   South Carolina's highway patrol reported more than 300 traffic
citations on its 200-mile stretch of I-95 by Friday morning, said
spokesman Brian Ellison.
   Connecticut state police netted 1[ kilograms of cocaine and
about 1{ pounds of marijuana. About 480 citations were given,
including one for drunken driving.
   Darien Cedric Wright, 23, of Jacksonville, Fla., was being held
without bail Friday after being arrested on drug trafficking
charges about eight miles north of Cocoa Beach, Fla. Troopers said
they found two kilograms of cocaine and 263 grams of crack cocaine
in his car.
   The drugs found in Wright's car had an estimated street value of
$62,500.
   ``Maybe this will have an adverse effect on criminals using our
highways,'' said Florida Highway Patrol Lt. Randy Brown.
   Police in Maryland seized 23.4 grams of marijuana, 66.7 grams of
cocaine and $890 in currency. Thirty-six motorists were arrested,
including one for a stolen vehicle and four on fugitive warrants.
   In Rhode Island, three people were arrested on charges of
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, one was arrested
for simple possession and one trucker was arrested on a charge of
possession of a sawed-off shotgun, said Lt. Norman Pineau.
   He said Rhode Island police confiscated a total of slightly more
than one ounce of alleged cocaine.
   ``It's the first time ... that we've all participated in
something like this,'' said Rhode Island State Police Capt. Frank
McGee.
   Pineau said 1,148 people were stopped and 213 were issued
traffic citations, including 43 for speeding.
   The other states participating in the sweep were: North
Carolina, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey,
Delaware and New Hampshire.

<HEAD>Former Montana Governor Dies from Self-inflicted Gunshot Wound</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Forrest H. Anderson, who ushered Montana
into a new era of government during his one term as governor, is
dead at the age of 76.
   Anderson died Thursday from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to
the abdomen, Lewis and Clark County Coroner Mickey Nelson said. He
had been in failing health for years.
   ``Forrest was not a coward; he was very, very strong,'' said
longtime friend and former state Supreme Court Justice Gene Daly.
``I would think he just got damn tired of being sick. I know he was
unhappy about being incapacitated.''
   Gov. Stan Stephens said he was ordering flags flown at half
staff to honor the memory of the former governor, adding, ``We've
lost a very dedicated public servant.''
   Andersen, a Democrat, served as a state legislator, attorney
general, and Supreme Court justice. He served only one term as
governor, from 1969-1972, but oversaw some of the most sweeping
changes in the history of Montana government.
   When he took office, government was run by more than 300 state
boards, bureaus and agencies. By the time he left office, it had 19
state departments and a new constitution.
   ``When he became governor, we had a government essentially from
the 1890s,'' said William F. Crowley, a University of Montana law
professor and former adviser to Anderson. ``And when he was
through, we had possibly what was the most modern governmental
system in the United States.''

<HEAD>Federal Judge Orders Arrest of Brazilian Investor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday ordered
the arrest of multimillionaire investor Naji Nahas and former
Central Bank president Elmo Camoes for allegedly participating in a
stock scandal.
   Judge Augusto Guilherme Diefenthaeler of Rio's 13th federal
court said the two were accused of ``inadmissible manipulation'' of
the Rio and Sao Paulo stock exchanges.
   Nahas is suspected as the central figure in a recent stock
market scandal that forced the closing of six brokerages.
   Camoes was forced to resign as president of the Central Bank,
Brazil's equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve, when the brokerage
firm he owned was accused in the speculation scandal.
   In his three-page statement, Diefenthaeler said Nahas and Camoes
should be arrested to prevent ``the possibility of them committing
similar acts in the market through other investors.''
   ``The dimension of the problem would leave the law in danger ...
if the accused were to come and go freely,'' the judge said.
   Federal District Attorney Celia Regina Souza Delgado said
federal police began a nationwide hunt for the two Thursday night.
   Ms. Delgado had requested that Nahas and Camoes be jailed until
brought to trial.
   Nahas, a 42-year-old multimillionaire businessman and No. 1
investor in Brazil's $30 billion stock market, was the pivot of a
scandal that sent Brazilian stock markets into a tailspin.
   The scandal broke June 9, when Nahas failed to cover checks
worth $31 million to pay for highly speculative deals on the Rio de
Janeiro Stock Exchange.
   The stock markets went into a tailspin andthe government ordered
them shut on June 12 to avoid further panic. The government also
barred Nahas from leaving the country. The markest reopened the
next day.
   Six brokerages involved in the scandal were closed and Camoes
resigned days later.
   On June 26, the federal police charged Nahas with two counts of
white-collar crime. Police said he tried to take $20,000 illegally
to London in 1987, and borrowed $12 million in 1983 from a bank of
which he was a major shareholder.
   The charges together carry an 11-year prison term.

   A strike by half the nation's 1
million coal miners threatened to idle the vital coke and steel
industries, while thousands of other miners who returned to work
claimed victory over the centralized system that dominates their
industry.
   About 150,000 miners returned to the pits Friday in western
Siberia, where the worst Soviet labor unrest in six decades began
July 11, after they were granted sweeping concessions. But the
strike continued in other major coal-producing areas.
   All 26 mines in the Karaganda region of the southern republic of
Kazakhstan were shut down and miners made more than 70 demands, the

   The Bush administration's clean air bill,

from industry for its tough measures on utilities and ambitious
program for clean-fueled cars.
   ``Assertions by some that this is a weak bill are simply
ludicrous,'' William Fay, administrator of the multi-industry Clean

   Environmentalists and their congressional supporters argued that
President Bush caved in to industry's economic concerns and
produced a watered-down bill that would not fix the nation's
worsening air pollution.
   Fay was not quite as harsh in assessing the legislation, which
Bush presented to Congress on Friday with a promise to ``make clean

final stage of a sewer project.
   The tongue-in-cheek celebration called SewerFest gave residents

   ``Didn't you love the noises? It was wonderful,'' beamed Marion

<TEXT>
   Relying on basic analysis of companies,
financial markets and the economy, Wright Investors' Service sent
several sharp warnings to its clients several weeks before the
crash of October 1987.
   The substance of those messages was the same, that the stock
market was grossly overpriced, had been for many weeks and was
destined to fall soon and sharply. Within a few weeks came the
biggest shakeout in history.
   Now Wright is issuing warnings again. The international firm
based in Bridgeport, Conn., says prices may have overshot their
marks.
   The new warnings don't have the urgency of those made in 1987.
Instead of flashing red, you might say, they are a steady amber.
But the sugggestion is there: If prices continue to rise the
signals might turn red again.
   Its forecast: ``While nowhere near as excessively priced today
as two summers ago, stocks are clearly still overvalued in light of
current bond yields and uncertain prospects for the near-term
economy and profits.''
   Consequently, it adds, stock prices may weaken during the second
half of 1989 while bond market values increase.
   Among the basic tools used by Wright in such analyses are
price-earnings ratios, price-equity ratios, dividend yields, bond
yields and the prospect for corporate earnings. The analyses
contain little that is subjective.
   PRICE-EARNINGS. Rising stock prices and the prospect of lower
corporate profits in the quarters ahead have caused the
price-earnings ratio of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index to
rise to 13.1 from 10.7 earlier in 1989.
   Those ratios are based on earnings expected for the 12 months to
come, and could be affected by unexpectedly higher profits. But
based on reasonable expectations, the P-E is now above its 20-year
average of about 11, although still well below the multiple of 16
times earnings in August 1987.
   PRICE-EQUITY. From 1.9 times shareholder equity at book value
when the year began, the S&amp;P 500 has moved up to a multiple of 2.1.
Over the past 20 years the norm has been 1.5, indicating a
substantial overvaluation.
   DIVIDEND YIELD. It is declining. The current 3.2 percent
dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 compares with 3.5 percent as the year
began, and with 4.1 percent averaged over the past 20 years.
   In other words, the S&amp;P 500 is now priced at 32 times current
dividends, one-quarter higher than its average multiple of 25
during the past two decades. Obviously, says Wright, dividends are
giving little support to prices.
   BOND YIELDS. The spread between bond yields and the yield of
stock earnings has become more unfavorable for equities, a
consequence of rising stock prices and a slight deterioration in
the outlook for corporate profits.
   As the year began, the difference was 0.4 percent in favor of
stocks, a spread that compares favorably with the average for the
past 20 years. Today the spread is in favor of bonds, even though
fixed income yields have fallen.
   To move the relationship back to normal, says Wright, will
require a combination of lower stock prices, higher corporate
profits and lower bond yields. Fortunately, it adds, interest rates
are likely to continue to fall.
   In short, not an alarming situation, but one that prudent
investors should keep in mind as the Dow Jones industrial average
comes within 90 percent of its all-time high of 2,722 points, just
before the crash of 1987.

<HEAD>Time, Warner Confident Deal Will Go Through, But Are They Safe?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. expect
to win their takeover fight with Paramount Communications Inc. and
merge as planned, but it's not certain the combination will shield
them from another hostile bid.
   Time and Paramount officials have said the sheer size of the
merged company, Time Warner Inc., would not protect it from attack.
But securities analysts say potential bidders likely would be
discouraged by the enormous debt that will burden Time after the
deal.
   The Delaware Supreme Court was scheduled to hear arguments
Monday in Paramount's appeal of a lower court ruling allowing the
Time-Warner deal to proceed.
   Legal scholars, analysts and investors generally expected the
state's highest court to uphold the July 14 decision that said
Paramount and Time shareholders have no right to block the merger.
   That decision has been widely viewed as an important affirmation
of a company's right to shape its long-term business strategy,
regardless of what shareholders want.
   The Delaware Supreme Court's ruling could come right after the
hearing. That would allow Time to complete its $14 billion tender
offer for Warner as scheduled at 5 p.m EDT Monday.
   Delaware has jurisdiction in the case because, like most major
U.S. companies, Time, Warner and Paramount all are incorporated in
the tiny state, which historically has offered low taxes and
liberal business laws.
   Paramount said prior to the hearing that the Time-Warner deal
would thwart any rival bidders, even those willing to pay $200 a
share, the amount Paramount has offered for Time.
   ``That of course includes us,'' Paramount stated.
   But in testimony in the court battle in Delaware, Paramount
Chairman Martin Davis, Time President N.J. Nicholas Jr. and Time
Vice Chairman Jerry Levin, among others, said Time would not be
totally secure after acquiring Warner.
   Some observers believe that despite Paramount's protests, the
company may be considering an offer for Time Warner in the future.
Others doubt anyone will make a run at Time Warner, at least not
immediately.
   ``Theoretically they are (open to attack), but practically, I
think it would be difficult,'' said Fred Anschel, an analyst with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   PaineWebber Inc. analyst J. Kendrick Noble said the magnitude of
the Time Warner marriage and the resulting debt that Time will
occur make the possibility of a takeover ``highly remote.''
   Theories have been floated around Wall Street that someone could
bid for Time Warner, then pare unwanted assets to defray the costs
of the transaction in the strategy commonly known as the leveraged
buyout.
   But there's a big drawback to that idea: Any asset sales would
give an acquirer a big tax bill that would eat into the proceeds.
   ``A raider probably would not get his money back,'' Noble said.
   Published reports last week said Time and Warner were themselves
considering the sale of some assets, including Time's Scott,
Foresman &amp; Co., a book publisher, to help finance their merger.
   ``We have not publicly revealed what assets if any, the combined
companies will sell,'' said Time spokesman Edward Adler, calling
the reports of possible sales ``hypothetical strategies.''
   How much it would cost to buy Time Warner depends ultimately on
how much cash Time pays for Warner. Time will pay $70 per share in
cash for half of Warner's 200 million outstanding shares in the
tender offer scheduled to expire Monday, and $70 in a combination
of cash and securities for the remaining shares in what is called
the deal's ``back end.''
   Time says it does not expect to announce how much cash and
securities the back end will contain _ or whether Time will have to
issue new common stock _ until some time, perhaps several months,
after the tender offer expires. That means the exact cost of the
merger and the amount of Time Warner's debt is yet to be determined.
   But the cost of a Time Warner buyout would be stratospheric and
``will almost certainly require a combination of parties, including
possibly an LBO type of firm,'' Anschel said.
   He projected the Time Warner debt at $11 billion to $12 billion.
A bid matching Paramount's $200 a share offer would cost $12.2
billion, and could go higher.
   Between the cost of the shares and the debt, ``you're talking
$25 billion,'' Anschel said.
   There is still the problem of servicing that debt after a buyout
is accomplished.
   ``I'm not sure it's too likely near term,'' Anschel said of a
Time Warner bid.
   Ever since Time and Warner announced plans to merge last March,
Wall Street expected someone to make a pitch for one or both firms,
and after Paramount launched its bid June 6, rumors flew about a
bid for that company too.
   No other bidders have emerged, but some observers are waiting to
see what might happen after Delaware's court rules.

   Having heard what they wanted to hear from
Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve, Wall Streeters now
have begun to ask, ``What's next?''
   As expected, Greenspan testified in his regular midyear
appearance before a congressional committee this past week that the
Fed had shifted its sights in the past few months.
   The central bank is less concerned now about inflationary
pressures, he said, and has grown more watchful about the risk of
``an unnecessary and destructive recession.''
   That effectively made it official that the Fed had begun in
recent weeks to relax its credit policy, encouraging interest rates
to decline in an effort to cushion the effects of a slowing economy
on businesses, workers and consumers.
   With added evidence to support their hopes for a ``soft
landing,'' stock traders responded enthusiastically, bidding prices
up their highest levels of the year.
   Indeed, some broad measures of market trends briefly surpassed
the peaks they reached nearly two years ago, before the crash of
October 1987.
   But the positive reaction didn't last long. By the end of the
session on Thursday, a few hours after Greenspan's remarks, both
stocks and bonds had given up just about all their morning gains.
On Friday both markets turned in another inconclusive showing.
   While they applauded much of what he said, analysts in the
financial world noted that all of Greenspan's comments weren't
absolute positives for the investment outlook.
   For one thing, much of what he put into words had been signaled
weeks before by the Fed's actions in the money markets, and
Greenspan was vague on whether rates would fall further from here.
   For another, Greenspan cautioned that the Fed had set itself a
tricky mission, in the course of which it just might wind up
worsening rather than solving the problems it was seeking to tame.
   ``I cannot rule out a policy mistake as the trigger for a
downturn,'' he said. ``We at the Federal Reserve might fail to
restrain a speculative surge in the economy, or fail to recognize
that we were holding reserves too tight for too long.''
   Nevertheless, the stock market rang up its third straight weekly
gain. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 52.54 to
2,607.36.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 2.09 to
187.15; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
added 0.39 to 449.29, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 3.16 at 371.28.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 175.90 million shares a day,
against 160.26 million the week before.
   The idea, as suggested by Greenspan, that the Fed is neither
all-powerful nor infallible isn't exactly new.
   But it is often ignored or dismissed by commentators, many of
them critics who contend that the Fed has too much power and too
few people it must answer to in the course of conducting its
business.
   In the world of the late 1980s, James Grant, editor of the
newsletter Grant's Interest Rate Observer, leans toward the view
that the Fed's influence is limited by international flows of money
and credit, or ``liquidity.''
   ``If the Federal Reserve is tight (as it's been for a year or
more), why is the stock market high?,'' Grant said. ``Why is there
so much bank credit for so many zany transactions? Why are so many
people having so much fun?
   ``Perhaps liquidity is not a single gurgling brook but a mighty
river with many tributaries. Perhaps the Fed is only one of these
sources.
   ``Liquidity is international and psychological more than
domestic and tangible. It is the predisposition of debtors to
borrow and of creditors to lend.''

<TEXT>
   Only a few years ago California's Bank of
America seemed to be sliding into the slurpy swamp of bad debt,
while across the country the Bank of New England thrived on a
thundering economy and demand for new loans.
   As most in the banking industry well know, times can change
rather suddenly in a business predicated on the fluctuating cost of
money and the assumption that borrowers will prosper and promptly
repay what they owe.
   Quarterly earnings released this past week by big U.S. banks
reflected a remarkable resurgence at BankAmerica Corp., the
nation's second-largest banking company, and an equally remarkable
rout at Bank of New England Corp., No. 17.
   The bank earnings reports also graphically illustrated how the
American economy is a hodgepodge of regions, some marked by strong
expansion, others by rising unemployment and slumping markets for
goods, services and property.
   BankAmerica earned $304 million, or $1.50 a share, in the three
months ended June 30, up 87.7 percent from $162 million or 85 cents
a share earned a year earlier.
   It was the third straight quarter of company record results and
exceeded expectations of many securities analysts, who only a few
years back were railing against BankAmerica for its huge loan
losses and seemingly unending flow of red ink.
   They attributed the resurgence to the company's efforts to
control costs and reduce a big exposure to unpaid Third World loans
and other forms of delinquent or bad debts.
   BankAmerica Chairman A. W. Clausen said the bank's performance
also was helped by an expansion of domestic loans and deposits,
especially among consumers and homebuyers, a signal of the buoyant
economy in California and Washington where the bank operates
extensively.
   The story was drastically different at Bank of New England,
which only a few years ago was aggressively granting loans to
residents and businesses basking in prosperity of what was one of
the fastest growing regions.
   Bank of New England reported a 47 percent drop in second-quarter
earnings because of unpaid debts and a squeeze on its interest rate
margins. That's the difference between the interest a bank makes on
its own investments and the rate it pays on deposits.
   The bank earned $36.5 million or 52 cents a share in the three
months ended June 30, vs. $69.2 million or $1 a share a year
earlier. Banking analysts called it dramatic evidence of the
decline in the New England economy.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan disclosed he expects
the economy to slow in coming months but a recession isn't likely,
signaling that the central bank is prepared to ease interest rates
further because it views inflation as a lessening threat.
   _Greenspan's testimony at his twice-yearly report to Congress
was partly substantiated by government statistics: June consumer
prices fell 0.2 percent, the smallest gain in 16 months; June
wholesale prices fell 0.1 percent; and reports on retail sales,
industrial output and factory use also suggested economic growth is
slowing. But in a sign that the economy remains strong, the May
trade deficit swelled to $10.24 billion, the worst showing in five
months.
   _There were more dramatic maneuvers in the corporate takeover
business. The three-way battle for media giant Time Inc. headed to
a hearing in Delaware's highest court; Dow Chemical Co. agreed to
acquire a majority stake in pharmaceutical maker Marion
Laboratories Inc. for more than $2 billion; and Gillette Co., a
veteran of two hostile acquisition attempts, sold a $600 million
stake to multibillionaire investor Warren Buffett as a defensive
step.
   _Eastern Airlines took a major step in trying to resurrect
itself from a crippling four-month-old strike and the refuge of
bankruptcy court. Eastern filed a reorganization plan detailing how
it plans to sell assets, pay all debts and emerge as a smaller but
healthy airline.

<TEXT>
   John M. Cranor III, a top executive at
Pepsico Inc., was appointed Friday as president and chief executive
of the food and soft drink maker's Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp.
subsidiary.
   Cranor, 42, formerly president of Pepsi-Cola East, will succeed
Richard P. Mayer, who resigned to become president of General Foods
U.S.A., said D. Wayne Calloway, chairman of the board and chief
executive of Pepsico, based in Purchase, N.Y.
   ``We're very fortunate to have a leader of John Cranor's caliber
to succeed Dick,'' Calloway said in a news release. ``We have great
confidence in the entire KFC organization, and look forward to even
greater success in the years ahead under John's leadership.''
   KFC is the world's second-largest quick service restaurant
system with about 8,000 restaurants generating sales of nearly $6
billion. It was acquired by PepsiCo in October 1986.
   Cranor has held a series of marketing, operations and general
management positions in the restaurant, soft drinks and snack food
businesses.
   He began his PepsiCo career in 1977 as marketing group manager
at Frito-Lay, where he eventually served as vice president of new
business development and vice president of marketing.
   Cranor then was a senior vice president and later president of
Wilson Sporting Goods, then a Pepsico subsidiary.
   In 1985, he joined Taco Bell and became division vice president,
making him responsible for 1,300 restaurants in the United States.
He then became president of PepsiCo's Fountain Beverage operations
in 1986.
   Cranor was promoted to president of Pepsi-Cola East in February
1988, making him responsible for all Pepsi operations in the
Northeast.

<HEAD>New Presidents Named at Kraft, Whitman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Philip Morris Cos.' General
Foods division is moving to Whitman Corp., prompting a high-level
management change at Kraft General Foods, the nation's largest food
company, officials said Friday.
   Miles L. Marsh, who served in various positions at Kraft before
its takeover by New York-based Philip Morris last year, will move
to Whitman Sept. 1 as president and chief operating officer.
   Marsh will be succeeded as president at General Foods USA by
Richard P. Mayer, and James M. Kilts has been named president of
Kraft General Foods' Kraft USA unit.
   Marsh, 42, will oversee all of Chicago-based Whitman's
subsidiaries, including food-maker Pet Inc., Pepsi-Cola General
Bottlers, Hussmann Corp. and Midas International.
   ``We are all looking forward to working closely with him as we
take the next steps in our long-range plan to increase value for
our shareholders,'' Whitman chairman and chief executive officer,
Karl Bays, said in a statement Friday.
   In 1976, Marsh served as a consultant for McKinsey and Co. for
five years. He then served eight years with Dart &amp; Kraft in the
United States and London.
   He was named president of Kraft International in 1985 and later
was appointed president of the Operations and Technology Group of
Kraft, based in suburban Glenview.
   It is hoped his presence at Whitman will strengthen the
company's focus on consumer goods and services, Bays said.
   Mayer, former chairman and chief executive officer of Kentucky
Fried Chicken Worldwide, a unit of Pepsico Inc., will join General
Foods immediately.
   Mayer's experience in consumer products management spans more
than 20 years and includes both package goods and foodservice
operations in both a domestic and international framework, Kraft
said.
   Kilts, who was senior vice president of strategy and development
for Kraft General Foods, has two decades of experience with General
Foods and Kraft in product management and business development.
   He spearheaded the revitalization of Kraft Canada and was
instrumental in developing the plan for integrating Kraft and
General Foods, Kraft said.

<HEAD>Eastern Files Reorganization Plan; Creditors Express Support</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: For Saturday PMs</HEAD>

   Eastern Airlines' major creditors have expressed
support for the carrier's proposed reorganization plan, which would
give full repayment to creditors and to consumers holding tickets
canceled by the strike.
   Eastern filed its bankruptcy reorganization plan late Friday.
The plan provides that all Eastern's debts _ including outstanding
tickets _ totaling around $3.3 billion would be paid in full with
interest, mostly through cash payments.
   Consumers would have the option of either a cash refund or other
options such as tickets for other flights.
   The committee representing Eastern's major creditors in its
bankruptcy case said in a statement it ``supports Eastern's plan of
reorganization filed today with the bankruptcy court.''
   ``The committee is encouraged that the company has been meeting
its business plan and the committee will continue to monitor
operations through the ramp-up period,'' the creditors' statement
read. ``The committee looks forward to continued progress in the
case and to the emergence of Eastern from Chapter 11 as a
successfully reorganized airline.''
   Adam Harris, an attorney for the creditors' committee, said the
creditors would continue to support Eastern's proposal so long as
the airline's operating goals were met.
   But Eastern's pilots union warned that the airline still was
``far removed'' from securing bankruptcy court approval of its
plan. The union noted that, among other steps, Eastern still must
negotiate with the creditors over specific elements of the
proposal, which centers on a restructuring of the company as a
smaller, more efficient carrier.
   Friday was the scheduled end of Eastern's exclusive period for
filing a bankruptcy reorganization plan. The strikebound company
was not required to seek creditor approval before filing the plan,
but apparently did so to try to bolster overall support for the
proposal, which also must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton R. Lifland.
   Eastern has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from
creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a crippling
strike against the Miami-based carrier. The detailed reorganization
plan outlines how Eastern plans to emerge from bankruptcy at about
two-thirds its prestrike size.
   The airline wants to pay creditors with the proceeds of about
$1.8 billion in asset sales, including sales totaling $650 million
that already have been approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   Some of Eastern's biggest creditors, and the amounts they are
owed, are: European aircraft manufacturer Airbus Industrie, $95.94
million; General Electric Co., $75.47 million; aircraft maker
Boeing Co., $53.98 million; United Technologies Credit Corp.,
$22.30 million; Rolls-Royce Credit Corp., $5.89 million; and hotel
giant Marriott Corp., $1.05 million.
   The scheduled expiration of Eastern's exclusivity period, during
which other parties to the case cannot file reorganization
proposals under bankruptcy law, was midnight EDT Friday.
   Lifland agreed early this month to a joint request by Eastern
and major creditors to extend the exclusivity period for two weeks,
through July 21, after they indicated they were nearing agreement
on a restructuring plan.
   Submission of a reorganization plan during the exclusivity
period automatically gives a Chapter 11 company 60 days more to
seek creditors' approval. Under bankruptcy law, competing plans may
not be filed during that period.
   Eastern's plan assumes that its Latin American routes would be
sold for up to $375 million, sources close to the situation said
Friday. They said Eastern has been in negotiations with American
Airlines for such a sale.
   A memo earlier this week from Eastern Senior Vice President Tom
Matthews to the Air Line Pilots Association said the route sale
idea would be scrapped if the company reached a contract agreement
with the striking pilots.
   Marathon talks between representatives of Eastern and the pilots
union, mediated by bankruptcy examiner David I. Shapiro, continued
Friday near Tampa, Fla., with no signs of progress, a source close
to the negotiations said.
   On Thursday, Lifland approved the release of $75 million raised
by asset sales to Eastern. The airline initially asked for the
release of $100 million from its major creditors, while a committee
representing the creditors asked that only $40 million be released.
   However, the parties agreed to the $75 million figure and the
judge approved it, with the understanding Eastern could request
additional money from the escrow fund, which contains $352 million
from the sales of Eastern assets.
