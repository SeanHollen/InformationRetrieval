<HEAD>52 Students Arrested After Takeover Of University of Massachusetts
Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Fifty-two students were arrested Tuesday
evening after occupying a University of Massachusetts building
overnight to protest Defense Department-funded research.
   In New York City, thousands of City College students got an
unscheduled holiday after demonstrators occupied the campus
administration building to protest possible tuition increases,
prompting officials to suspend classes.
   About 60 police in riot gear arrived at the University of
Massachusetts around 5 p.m. About two hours later, a bus drove away
with 29 students who had camped inside Memorial Hall.
   Those students were charged with trespassing, and another 23
students were arrested for lying in front of the bus to prevent it
from leaving, police said.
   About 300 students stood outside the building chanting and
looking on as the students inside the hall were arrested.
   About 35 students had occupied Memorial Hall since 1 p.m.
Monday. They declined an offer to meet with administrators in the
provost's office Tuesday morning, and instead presented a list of
demands that included a halt to all Defense Department research at
the 25,000-student campus.
   About 40 students left the building Tuesday morning after
several university administrators told them they would be arrested
after 5 p.m., said university spokeswoman Jeanne Hopkins.
   The takeover was the second at the western Massachusetts campus
in a week. Seven protesters were arrested April 19 on charges of
disorderly conduct and trespassing after also demonstrating against
military-funded research on campus, particularly research into
anthrax.
   All research at the university is non-classified and researchers
must make their work public under university rules. About $11.6
million, or 22 percent of grant money received at the university,
came from the Defense Department in 1988, according to the school.
   Chancellor Joseph D. Duffey issued a statement telling the
students the research would continue on campus until school
administrators decide differently.
   ``The policy will not be negotiated with students,'' Duffey said.
   The latest occupation began when students rallying Monday at the
Student Union against military research marched toward the
administration building. Several then ducked into Memorial Hall en
route, and more followed.
   Members of the local chapter of the American Friends Service
Committee have contended that the research is dangerous to the
town, promotes militarism and should be banned.
   The university has argued the purpose of the anthrax research is
peaceful and the strain of bacteria used is non-virulent and has
been under study at the school for 23 years without incident.
   The Amherst health board has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday
on the question of the safety of the anthrax research.
   Tuesday was the first time since 1969 that classes at City
College of New York have been canceled because of student protests,
said school spokesman Charles DeCiccio.
   Protesters demanding a face-to-face meeting with Gov. Mario
Cuomo said they feared tuition at the college _ now $1,250 a year _
would be increased and the college staff would be reduced because
of state budget cuts.
   The governor had no immediate comment.
   Tuition for next year has not been set, DeCiccio said.

<HEAD>Senators: U.S. Cannot `Wimp Out' on Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States cannot ``wimp out'' on fraud in
Panama's upcoming presidential vote and still maintain credibility
in Central America, four U.S. senators said Monday after touring
the region.
   U.S. Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla., John McCain, R-Ariz., Charles
Robb, D-Va., and Connie Mack, R-Fla., hopscotched through Central
America over the weekend, visiting with U.S. and local officials.
   The scheduled May 7 election in Panama, which the senators said
is widely expected to be stacked in favor of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's candidate, is a test of U.S. attitudes toward next year's
Nicaraguan elections.
   ``We cannot allow to go unchallenged what is obviously a
massively fraudulent election in Panama,'' said McCain.
   The senators called Panama a test in U.S. sincerity, saying the
nation's actions will be used to judge attitudes toward next
February's elections in Nicaragua, which pit a leftist Sandinista
government against the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   ``If we wimp out in Panama, and passively let a fraudulent
election go forward ... I think our moral standing within Nicaragua
and our credibility to the world community will be seriously
compromised,'' Graham said.
   Graham and Mack said the United States must immediately focus
world attention on Panama, persuading as many foreign observers as
possible to oversee the vote even though Noriega has sought to ban
such activities.
   ``One of the things we have failed to do is to bring
international pressure with respect to Panama,'' Mack said.
   Graham said reports that President Bush had approved aid to the
Panamanian opposition were understandable, because the United
States has legitimate economic and military interests in the
nation, especially the Panama Canal.
   But he said he was puzzled by the $10 million amount reported.
   ``I was surpised, because the people with whom we met indicated
they were expecting to spend approximately $1 million on the
oppsoition campaign, and they had already raised a substantial
amount of that,'' the senator said. ``I was unclear where the
figure $10 million came from.''
   In Nicaragua, the senators said, Sandinista foreign ministry
official Victor Tinoco met with the senators to discuss next year's
scheduled election in that country.
   But Tinoco refused to answer the senators when they asked
point-blank if the Sandinistas would peacefully transfer power to
the winners of the February 1990 election, Graham said.
   In a visit to the Yamales Contra camp in Honduras, Graham said,
he found the rebels in high spirits. He said they would prefer to
be fighting, but understood their role in pressuring the
Sandinistas to comply with their commitment to democratize
Nicaragua.

   A communique from Premier Ciriaco De Mita's office Monday said
that people caught without their seat belts on will be subject to
fines ranging from 12,000 lire ($9) to 50,000 lire ($37).
   The regulations do not apply to pregnant women. The new rules
also require babies and toddlers to be in car seats and relegate
children up to the age of 12 to the back seat.
   The regulations were drawn up by the ministries of the Interior,
Public Works, Transport and Health.

   Startled tourists watched as a man scaled a barrier
and scooped up coins from the city's famed Trevi fountain until
police arrested him, authorities say.
   According to legend, tourists who throw coins over their
shoulders into the 18th century fountain will return to Rome.
   On Sunday afternoon, 41-year-old Franco Fascelli entered the
fountain, which is without water due to restoration work, police
said Monday.
   ``It really makes no difference who throws the coins into the
fountain. People who really want to return will come back anyway,''
Fascelli said as he was taken into custody, according to the Rome
newspaper Il Messaggero.

<HEAD>Lucille Ball Improving, Daughter Says Hairdo Utmost Post-Surgery
Worry</HEAD>

   Comedian Lucille Ball's first words
to her daughter after last week's emergency heart surgery was about
her hairdresser's appointment, actress Lucie Arnaz says.
   ``I went to mom's bedside where she was all tied to tubes and
things and I told her, `Hello mom, I love you,''' Miss Arnaz told
150 people Monday at the Beverly Hills Hotel for the Eastman Kodak
Second Century Award ceremony.
   ``She mumbled something under the oxygen mask, but I said I
couldn't hear her. Finally I asked the nurse if I could lift the
mask a little to hear what she was saying. So I did, and mom said,
`Wouldn't you know _ this is the day I was going to get my hair
done.'''
   Miss Ball was honored for her work in helping young people in
the entertainment field. Miss Arnaz accepted the award on her
mother's behalf.
   The 77-year-old actress was in serious condition and improving
daily, said Ron Wise of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   ``The outlook is very encouraging,'' he said. ``Her doctors have
her in the chair for longer periods each day. Her spirits are good
and she's cracking jokes.''
   She was moved Monday from the cardiac surgical intensive care
unit to a step-down unit, ``technically another intensive care
unit,'' said Wise. ``She should be in her own room toward the end
of the week.
   At the luncheon, Miss Arnaz said she was glad the award wasn't
postponed after her mother's heart attack ``because it means very,
very much to her at this time.''
   Presenting the award, comedian Carol Burnett told of being
visited by Miss Ball on the second night of her New York show,
``Once Upon a Mattress.''
   ``She came backstage to visit us all and she spent 30 to 35
minutes in my dressing room answering my questions,'' Miss Burnett
said.
   Miss Ball's husband, Gary Morton, also attended the luncheon,
where guests signed a huge card with the ``I Love Lucy'' heart logo
and the words, ``We Love Lucy _ Get Well Soon.''
   Wise said the mounds of get-well wishes arriving at the hospital
represents the biggest outpouring of affection for any celebrity
confined to Cedars-Sinai, known as the ``hospital to the stars.''
   ``We've received a tidal wave of mail with a couple thousand
letters coming in today,'' said Wise. ``It's taken four volunteers
several hours to sort it. She wants everything sorted so she can
see every one of them when she gets home.''
   Inside a package addressed to Miss Ball, Wise said, ``You can
hear `Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star' playing on a music box inside.''
   The surgery was performed April 18 when doctors replaced her
aorta and aortic valve with the donated organ tissue of a
27-year-old man.

   Director Steven Spielberg and actress Amy
Irving have agreed amicably to end their 3{-year marriage.
   ``Our mutual decision, however difficult, has been made in the
spirit of caring. And our friendship remains both personal and
professional,'' the couple said in a statement issued by publicist
Robert G. Friedman.
   ``We have decided to make this statement public in order to
protect the privacy of our family, which is of great importance to
us,'' it said.
   The divorce announcement followed months of speculation by
supermarket tabloids that the couple would split.
   Spielberg and Miss Irving were married in November 1985. They
have a 3-year-old son, Max.
   Details on child custody arrangements and division of property
weren't disclosed.
   Spielberg, 40, directed the box-office smashes ``Jaws'' and
``E.T. _ The Extra-Terrestrial,'' among other hits. Ms. Irving, 35,
was nominated for a supporting actress Oscar for ``Yentl'' and
recently starred in ``Crossing Delancey.''

   The heavyweight boxing champion and high-school dropout was
being given an an honorary doctorate in humane letters by Central
State University today.
   Tyson, dubbed ``Iron Mike'' for his devastating knockout punch,
was being honored at commencement ceremonies for his positive
influence on young people, the university said.
   ``Mike demonstrates that hard work, determination and
perseverance can enable one to overcome any obstacles,'' said
Arthur Thomas, president of the predominantly black university.
   ``When Mike tells (students) to study and go to college, it

   Six celebrated entertainers became the
first to enter the Clown Hall of Fame, capping a weekend of
clowning around.
   More than 300 people attended Sunday's ceremony in which Red
Skelton, Lou Jacobs, Mark Anthony, Emmett Kelly Sr., Otto Griebling
and Felix Adler were inducted.
   Master of ceremonies Steve Smith, who is also a clown, said the
gathering provided clown fans a chance to give a ``collective hug
back to those who have given so much.''
   The art of clowning is special because clowns share their
experience directly with their audience and no two performances are
alike, Smith said.
   Anthony and Jacobs accepted their awards in person while Skelton
addressed the audience via a videotaped message. Relatives of
Kelly, Griebling and Adler, who are deceased, also were on hand.
   The inductees were elected in January by members of the Clown
Hall of Fame and Research Center. The center was created to promote
the circus heritage of this city, which was the headquarters of
about two dozen circuses in the 19th century, including P.T.
Barnum's.
   Other festivities held during the weekend ``Clown Town
Colossal'' included clown performances, carnival games, rides,
circus concessions and a parade.

   Cher's boyfriend was fined $1,175 and ordered
to do 300 hours of community service for smashing a photographer's
camera outside the actress' home.
   Rob Camilletti, 24, an aspiring actor and former bagel baker,
also was put on two years' probation. Neither he nor Cher, 42, were
present at Monday's hearing before Municipal Judge Ronald
Schoenberg.
   Camilletti pleaded no contest in February to two counts of
vandalism for the July 27 incident. A reckless driving charge was
dismissed at sentencing.
   Talks continued on how much restitution Camilletti should pay
two freelance photographers whose equipment he damaged. Deputy City
Attorney Renee Laurents said the amount was expected to be settled
by Friday.
   During a news conference after the incident, Cher and Camilletti
angrily denied he was trying to run down the photographer when he
smashed the actress' Ferrari into a photographer's car. The actress
blamed pesky paparazzi and the frustration of living in a media
spotlight for the flare-up.
   Cher, who won a best actress Oscar in 1988 for her role in
``Moonstruck,'' has since moved out of the home. Camilletti says he
now lives in New York City and asked if he could perform the
community service there.
   Camilletti met Cher at a New York nightclub on her 40th
birthday. He could have been sentenced to one year in jail and
fined $2,000.

   Exxon and Alaska's top environmentalist
squabbled over the pace of the oil spill cleanup Monday as skimmers
in the Gulf of Alaska sought refuge from rough seas for the second
day in a row.
   Hatchery owners on Prince William Sound, meanwhile, announced
that 24 million salmon fry have been released into the sound, where
they must swim through seas hit by the spill.
   The salmon had to be released Sunday and Monday in conjunction
with the bloom of plankton in the sound to enhance their rate of
survival.
   ``We really have no choice but to release them now,'' said
Heather McCarty, a spokeswoman for the non-profit Prince William
Sound Aquaculture Association, which owns three hatcheries in the
sound.
   It is unclear what will happen to the fry as they migrate to the
open sea if they encounter oil, McCarty said.
   As cleanup work continued in the sound, gale warnings and seas
swelling to 18 feet kept aircraft on the ground and skimmers close
to shore Monday, said coordinators of the military's role in the
cleanup.
   Exxon, however, called a news conference to announce that the
cleanup was ahead of the pace calculated in the oil company's
federally approved plan, which figures the cleanup will be done by
Sept. 15.
   K.T. Koonce, Exxon USA's vice president for exploration and
production, said 70 percent of the 10.1 million-gallon spill had
evaporated, dissipated or been recovered. The company said 1.8
gallons had been recovered. An estimated 1.2 million gallons
remains afloat.
   The oil spilled March 24 from the Exxon Valdez, a fully loaded
tanker that ran aground on Bligh Reef as it steered from the Valdez
terminal through Prince William Sound.
   Dennis Kelso, commissioner of Alaska's Despartment of
Environmental Conservation, questioned Exxon's claim and said the
oil company's efforts remain inadequate.
   ``I would look carefully at the figure and not take it at face
value,'' said Kelso, adding that the estimate was based on Exxon's
computer models and could be off by as much as 50 percent.
   ``What I want to see is some results,'' he said after Exxon's
news conference.
   While the rough seas kicked oil onto beaches that had previously
been spared, Monday's weather also broke up oil and increased the
likelihood that more crude will be carried to the open seas of the
Gulf of Alaska.
   ``We see this (storm) as a good thing,'' said Karen Gleason, a
spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   Fishermen from Homer and other maritime communities south of
Anchorage have sewn absorbent material into nets and are picking up
oil in much the same way they might be gathering herring this time
of year.
   A cleanup priority has been set for beaches where seals come out
with their pups each summer. Thousands of sea birds and hundreds of
otters already have been found dead.
   State officials have canceled or postponed herring, black cod
and shrimp harvests in the sound, and closed a portion of the
Kodiak herring fishing grounds.
   Fisheries officials in Seattle were expected to decide Wednesday
whether to cancel the May 15-16 halibut season. Heavy oil has been
reported around the Barren Islands at the mouth of Cook Inlet where
many large boats congregate for the 24-hour open season.
   In Los Angeles, meanwhile, Vice President Dan Quayle warned oil
companies not to use the nation's worst oil spill as an excuse to
raise gasoline prices.
   ``If they are, it is going to be a very difficult situation for
them,'' Quayle, who plans a firsthand look at the cleanup next
month, said in Los Angeles.
   Allegations have been made that a temporary shortage of oil
caused by the spill was used a pretext for gas price hikes.
   Quayle made his comments after meeting with former President
Reagan and his wife, Nancy, in Los Angeles as he left on a trip to
Australia and Southeast Asia. He is scheduled to visit Prince
William Sound on his way back May 4.
   Quayle said he would tour the area, and collect information for
President Bush.

   The Associated Press will introduce three new
services for readers this year to help meet the changing needs of
the news industry, AP President and General Manager Louis D.
Boccardi said.
   ``I want to reaffirm something that I think you know is true, at
least I hope you know is true,'' Boccardi told news executives at
the AP annual meeting Monday. ``That is that I want quality service
and responsiveness to be the twin themes of everything the AP
does.''
   Earlier Monday, President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle
both addressed the annual meeting and luncheon, highlighting the
start of the 103rd annual convention of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association.
   Bush, reporting on his first 100 days in office, listed among
his accomplishments savings and loan legislation, ethics proposals,
the beginning of a war on drugs and agreements with Congress on the
federal budget and Contra aid.
   ``In three short months we've made a good start coming to grips
with issues demanding urgent attention and decisive action,'' he
said.
   At the same time, defense and foreign policy reviews,
environmental legislation and a program to deal with homelessness
``are all on the near horizon,'' Bush added.
   He also suggested his relationship with the media had matured
after a sometimes-rocky presidential campaign.
   ``Both of us, government and the news media, need one another
and we owe each other a measure of respect, honesty and integrity
equal to the work we're engaged in,'' Bush said.
   The president also pledged continued administration efforts to
win the release of Terry Anderson, AP chief Middle East
corrrespondent, who last month began his fifth year as a hostage in
Lebanon.
   Hours before departing on a trip along the Pacific rim, Quayle
addressed his remarks to the ``declinists'' both at home and abroad
who have predicted a diminished standing for the United States as a
global power.
   ``The point that I will stress to my Asian hosts is that when
Americans express doubts about the health of American society, it's
usually a sign of renewal, not of decline,'' he said.
   Boccardi, who followed Bush at the luncheon, told the AP annual
meeting that improving technology was quickly changing the business
of reporting and delivering news, and that the pace would only
accelerate.
   As an example, he noted that this year the AP was able for the
first time to deliver a presidential inauguration picture in time
for East Coast afternoon newspapers, by using direct transmission
from a digital camera onto the AP photo network.
   He said the news products to be introduced later this year are
aimed at different sections of the newspaper _ new state weather
maps, a sports statistic page and a regular story package aimed at
readers over age 50.
   The state weather maps would compliment national and regional
maps already provided. The AP also will supply a national weather
map in color via its GraphicsNet system of computer-to-computer
transmission.
   The full-page layout of sports agate, complete with graphic
labels and headlines, would be transmitted over the AP's
GraphicsNet system and updated throughout the day.
   The biweekly package of stories and columns aimed at Americans
age 50 and over, dealing with such subjects as retirement planning,
health and legislation affecting the elderly. An added staff member
will be assigned to this package, called ``Prime Time.''
   In his ``report card'' to the members, Boccardi also said the AP
this year will complete the conversion to a 9,000-word-a-minute
high-speed transmission system for DataStream and DataFeature news
copy, after a delay caused by a worldwide shortage of advanced
computer memory chips.
   He also said a new highspeed photo service, PhotoStream, will be
running on a test-basis by mid-year.
   The AP's annual report noted that 72 more daily newspapers
joined the news cooperative in 1988, bringing total membership at
the end of 1988 to 1,483 dailies, representing 95 percent of daily
U.S. newspaper circulation.
   The meeting agenda also included election of seven members of
the AP's 21-member board of directors, including three new members.
All members were elected to three-year terms.
   The new board members are:
   William M. Boyd Jr. of the Central New Jersey Home News of New
Brunswick; William R. Burleigh, senior vice president-newspapers
and publishing, Scripps Howard; and John G. Montgomery of The Daily
Union of Junction City, Kan.
   Four incumbent directors were re-elected:
   David R. Bradley Jr. of the News-Press@Gazette of St. Joseph,
Mo., Frank A. Daniels Jr. of the Raleigh (N.C.) News &amp; Observer and
Times, William J. Keating, chief executive officer, Detroit
Newspaper Agency, and Harold R. Lifvendahl of The Orlando (Fla.)

   William M. Boyd Jr., William R. Burleigh and John
G. Montgomery have been elected to the board of directors of The
Associated Press. Four incumbent directors were re-elected.
   David R. Bradley Jr. of the News-Press@Gazette of St. Joseph,
Mo., Frank A. Daniels Jr. of the Raleigh (N.C.) News &amp; Observer and
Times, William J. Keating, chief executive officer, Detroit
Newspaper Agency, and Harold R. Lifvendahl of The Orlando (Fla.)
Sentinel were elected to new three-year terms on the AP board.
Keating is chairman of the board.
   Directors were elected from among 12 nominees at the AP annual
meeting on Monday.
   Burleigh and Montgomery were chosen to succeed retiring
directors Howard H (Tim) Hays Jr. of The Press-Enterprise of
Riverside, Calif., and John M. Jones of The Greeneville (Tenn.)
Sun. Hays and Jones were not eligible for re-election because they
have served the maximum three consecutive three-year terms on the
board.
   Burleigh is senior vice president for newspapers and publishing,
Scripps Howard.
   Boyd is chairman of the board, president and publisher of Home
News Publishing Company, New Brunswick, N.J.
   Montgomery is president and publisher of Montgomery
Publications, Inc., Junction City, Kan.
   Boyd was elected to fill the vacancy created by the resignation
from the board of Katherine W. Fanning, who resigned as editor of
The Christian Science Monitor last year. Her term on the board
expires in 1991.
   The AP membership earlier Monday approved a resolution that was
passed in February by the executive committee of the board of
directors authorizing the sixth-place vote-getter - excluding the
separate voting for a director representing a city of less than
50,000 population - to fill her unexpired term
   The voting for directors was based on membership bonds held by
the newspapers that make up the cooperative news agency.
   The results:
   Keating, 14,145 bond votes.
   Daniels, 13,644.
   Bradley, 12,379.
   Lifvendahl, 12,117.
   Burleigh, 10,570.

   The Xinghua Clothing Factory has abandoned plans
to buy new machines from Japan because it doesn't have the
electricity to run them.
   ``Without the right connections it would take years to get
approval for the extra power,'' said Man Ying, energy manager at
the 250-employee factory in Beijing.
   The factory also can't buy air conditioners for the sweltering
summers and this past winter went days without heat because of a
lack of coal.
   ``We send out special teams to look for coal,'' she said, adding
that they sometimes must pay free market sellers and profiteers up
to 130 yuan ($35) a ton for it, three times the state-set rate.
   Xinghua is forced to shut down once a six-day week, every
Friday, in the midst of the worst energy crisis in Communist
China's 40-year history.
   But it is more fortunate than factories in the key industrial
cities of Shanghai and Shenyang, which operate only three or four
days of their usual six-day week. In parts of Jiangsu province,
another industrial center near Shanghai, up to a third of the
factories were closed and 40 percent of the power plants had
stopped working at the end of the year because of coal shortages.
   In Beijing, 500 factories employing 100,000 now operate only on
night shifts because they have no power during the day.
   Not only factories are affected.
   In Beijing, a city of 10 million people, elevators in high-rise
buildings don't work, new color televisions sit idle and people
stock up on candles.
   The official Guangming Daily noted that even the headquarters of
the Energy Resources Ministry has been ordered to shut off all
electrical appliances every Thursday.
   China has been losing an average 200 billion yuan ($54 billion)
a year during the 1980s due to power cuts. Last year the losses
were believed to be double that as up to one-third of production
capacity was unused.
   The crisis reflects the inability of energy production to match
the nation's explosive industrial growth. Industrial output
increased by more than 20 percent in 1988, but production of coal,
used for 70 percent of China's energy, was up only 4 percent.
   Energy supplies have also failed to cope with China's new-found
prosperity which has resulted in a surge of demand for televisions,
refrigerators, microwaves and other electrical appliances. In
Beijing last year, energy consumption by households jumped 29
percent, while power supply was up by only 3 percent.
   The Guangming Daily noted that one large luxury hotel in Beijing
today consumes as much energy as all of Beijing did in the early
1950s.
   Another problem is that China, although the world's largest
producer of coal with 970 million tons last year, can't get the
power to the places it is needed.
   Most of the nation's coal is mined in the north, but industry is
centered mainly along the southern coast. Half the country's badly
overtaxed railway system and a third of river transport is devoted
to carrying coal, but that still wasn't enough. Last year about 8
million tons, or 3.5 percent of the state coal supply quota, was
not delivered.
   According to a report in the weekly publication Outlook
(Liaowang), one large coal mine in Shanxi province, in the heart of
coal country, had to stop operations temporarily because it lacked
fuel to run its bulldozers.
   Low investment in energy industries, inefficient small mines and
artificially low state-set prices for energy have widened the gap
between supply and demand. Profiteering by officials with access to
coal supplies _ even in the army _ is pandemic.
   Coal should sell for the state-price equivalent of $8 to $11 a
ton but it goes for $54 to $80 after passing through the hands of
various middlemen on its way to Shanghai or Canton.
   The government is considering various possible solutions,
including more investment in energy production, higher taxes for
energy use and higher energy prices, to achieve what appears to be
an impossible goal of producing 1.5 billion tons of coal by the
year 2000.
   China now has no nuclear power but is building two plants along
the southern coast and has plans for others.
   As a stopgap measure, the government is hoping that its harsh
austerity campaign begun last fall will slow the economy down
enough to relieve the energy crisis.
   ``If we consider energy to be the lifeblood of modern society,''
the Guangming Daily said, ``today's China can be compared to a
patient suffering from anemia.''

   When it withdraws from Cambodia,
Vietnam will be at peace for the first time since its war for
independence began half a century ago against the French, Japanese
and eventually the Americans.
   Reformers now in control hope ending nearly 11 years of
occupation will bring better relations with the outside world,
including the United States. They believe Vietnam risks economic
disaster without expanded trade and assistance from abroad.
   Orders for Vietnam's invasion of neighboring Cambodia in
December 1978 came from founders of the Communist Party made
inflexible by the long struggle. Several have resigned or died
since, and the reformers pledge to withdraw the remaining
occupation forces by Sept. 30.
   Vietnam says 50,000 of its soldiers remain in Cambodia, but
foreign intelligence estimates put the number as high as 70,000.
   A new and bloodier round of civil war between the
Hanoi-sponsored Cambodian government and the three-party guerrilla
groups opposing it may begin after the withdrawal, but the
departure will be a boon to Vietnam.
   Its occupation, aided by the Soviet Union, angered nations on
which Vietnamese trade and economic development depend, such as the
United States, China and members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations: Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Brunei.
   Vietnam's invasion overthrew the brutal Khmer Rouge regime,
which was allied with China, and the Chinese army made a punitive
strike into Vietnam early in 1979. Because of sanctions and its
isolation, Vietnam soon found itself in worse shape economically
than the devastated country it had occupied.
   Ngo Dien, Vietnamese ambassador to Cambodia, says relations with
Thailand and the United States have improved and trade along the
China-Vietnam frontier has resumed. ``After the withdrawal, we will
see even more changes,'' he added.
   Washington says it will not consider aid or diplomatic relations
until Vietnamese military forces leave Cambodia, but Hanoi's pledge
and its efforts to account for Americans still missing from the
Vietnam war have caused more U.S. congressmen to recommend quicker
reconciliation.
   Thailand talks of turning Indochina's ``battlefields into
markets.''
   As a condition for a return to normal relations with the Soviet
Union, China has demanded that Moscow force Vietnam to leave
Cambodia. Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping, leaders of the
two countries, are to meet next month in Beijing for the
Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   Asked whether Vietnam made its decision under Soviet pressure,
Ngo Dien said: ``Mr. Gorbachev of course welcomed the withdrawal
because he has something in his hands for the summit.''
   ``Some people may call it pressure. Some people may call it good
coordination between close friends who have the same aim.''
   Improving relations with Vietnam might enable the non-communist
world to wean it from dependence on the Soviet Union and encourage
the limited steps Hanoi has taken toward a more open, freer society.
   For three centuries, Cambodia has found itself shrinking with
Vietnam's steady territorial expansion.
   Communist-led Vietnamese guerrillas used Cambodian and Laotian
territory as sanctuaries and supply routes for the war against the
French and the Americans, and helped communist movements to victory
in the two countries.
   Since economic reformer Nguyen Van Linh became party chief in
late 1986, however, Hanoi has taken steps to get out of Cambodia
and has withdrawn troops from Laos.
   A Soviet diplomat based in Phnom Penh said privately that some
Vietnamese ``saw themselves as the rulers of this country, but
luckily the others got the upper hand.''
   Uch Kiman, head of the Foreign Ministry's political department
in the government installed by Vietnam, suggested greater
independence for Cambodia will accompany the end of occupation.
   ``For the moment, I think we have to stick together because of
the political configuration in the region, but I think in the
future we don't want to wall ourselves in,'' he said.
   ``We certainly want to expand our relations to all neighboring
countries, especially the ASEAN countries.''
   According to the Soviet diplomat, ``Vietnam's influence will
remain'' after withdrawal, ``but it will not be monopolistic.''
   Ngo Dien suggested Vietnam would stop using military means to
resolve problems and would fix its attention on economic
development.

<HEAD>Genes May Influence Happiness on Job, Study Suggests</HEAD>

   Genes may influence how satisfied one is at
work, according to a study.
   But the study does not imply that people who dislike their jobs
are genetically doomed to unhappiness at work.
   The apparent impact of genes is quite modest, suggesting ``we're
not totally hard-wired'' for job satisfaction, said industrial
psychologist Richard Arvey.
   Besides, he said, just as nutrition can modify the genetic
influence on a person's height, the job setting may affect the
hypothesized genetic contribution to job satisfaction.
   The study suggests that genes may be one reason that some people
seem happy no matter what they do, while others have trouble
finding a satisfying job, Arvey said.
   The research is presented in this month's issue of the Journal
of Applied Psychology by Arvey, a professor at the Industrial
Relations Center of the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of
Management, and colleagues Lauren Abraham, Thomas Bouchard, Jr.,
and Nancy Segal.
   Arvey said the study does not prove genetic influence over job
satisfaction, but only supports the idea. He also noted that the
study was small, and cautioned against applying the results to the
general population.
   Two scientists who have studied genetic influence on personality
said the study fits in with previous research. John Loehlin of the
University of Texas at Austin said other research suggests genetic
influence on personality and temperament, and an effect on job
satisfaction appears plausible.
   Richard Rose of Indiana University in Bloomington said Finnish
studies of twins have found evidence that genes may influence a
person's job choice, satisfaction with life, and frequency of
changing jobs for such negative reasons as dissatisfaction or being
fired.
   But psychologist Leon Kamin of Northeastern University in
Boston, who has analyzed nature-versus-nurture research, said
Monday he was skeptical.
   The reason for studying identical twins reared apart is that
since twins in a pair share identical genes but grow up in
different environments, some similarities between them may reflect
genetic influence.
   But Kamin said previous studies showed twins reared apart tend
to grow up in similar family environments, which he said could
explain such similarities as degree of job satisfaction.
   The Minnesota study focused on 34 pairs of identical twins who
had been separated at an average age of less than 6 months. They
were not reunited until about age 32, on average. Twenty-five pairs
were women.
   Each twin completed a 20-item questionnaire about satisfaction
with the ``major job'' in his or her life. Arvey said the job list
was diverse, including research chemist, coal miner, assembly line
worker, computer analyst, machinist, nurse and financial planner.
Seventeen women said being a housewife was their major job.
   When researchers analyzed the various levels of general job
satisfaction reported by the 68 people, about 30 percent of the
differences appeared to be explained by genetic influence. The rest
was attributed other factors such as environment.
   Comparing jobs held by each member of twin pairs, researchers
found evidence that twins tended to hold jobs with similar degrees
of mental complexity, physical demands and physical coordination
requirements.
   That finding supports the idea that genes also affect what jobs
people seek, researchers said. But analysis showed it does not
explain the apparent genetic influence on job satisfaction.
   Arvey said there are several possible ways genes could influence
happiness in the workplace. Affecting personality is a ``very
likely mechanism,'' he said.
   Alternatively, he said, genes may influence what people pay
attention to in their job environment, such as supervision, or may
affect what people want from a job.

   Thousands of grieving friends and relatives
of the fallen 47 crewmen from the battleship USS Iowa gathered
quietly Monday and heard President Bush praise their loved ones as
``brothers in eternity.''
   ``We join today in mourning for the 47 who perished, and in
fact, for the 11 who survived,'' the president told a packed
memorial service at Norfolk Naval Air Station. ``They all were, in
the words of a poet, `the men behind the guns.'
   ``They came from Hidalgo, Texas; Cleveland, Ohio; Tampa,
Florida; Costa Mesa, California. They came to the Navy as
strangers, served the Navy as shipmates and friends, and left the
Navy as brothers in eternity. In the finest Navy tradition, they
served proudly on a great battleship, the USS Iowa.''
   The president, a World War II Navy pilot, said he was proud to
recommission the Iowa in 1984 and said it had earned 11 battle
stars in two wars.
   But with the still-unexplained fire and explosion last Wednesday
in the battleship's No. 2 gun turret, he said, ``Fate has written a
sorrowful chapter in the history of this great ship.''
   The Iowa's commander, Capt. Fred P. Moosally, said the turret's
crew was the best gun crew on the ship, and called its chief _
Chief Gunner's Mate Reginald Owen Ziegler of Port Gibson, N.Y. _
``my No. 1 chief.''
   Victims' relatives and hundreds of sailors and officers in dress
blues were among the 6,000 people crowded into a hangar for the
service. A bouquet of red roses was placed in front of the podium;
behind were an American flag and the battleship's banners. Outside,
another 2,000 people listened to the service on loudspeakers.
   As many as 500 Iowa crewmen were unable to attend the service
because they were delayed by traffic and were not permitted to
enter the hangar because of security measures to protect Bush.
   Many were angry they could not attend, said Machinist's Mate
David Finn, 38. ``It was very important to them,'' Finn said.
   The service came a day after the World War II-era battleship
eased into its home port, its gun barrels scorched and its 1,500
crewmen at the rails in white uniforms and black armbands in memory
of their dead shipmates.
   Moosally told the crowd of mourners that he remembered the men
of turret No. 2.
   ``I remember their faces as they toiled at their guns, sweating
an honest sweat that comes from young men dedicated to a great
cause,'' he said.
   ``I remember as they talked among themselves, looking so much
like sailors of the past, sharing the exuberance of the times and
the dreams of the future,'' he said.
   ``They were the life, the spirit and the soul of our ship. ...
They made the ultimate sacrifice for us. ... The men of Turret Two
will be part of the spirit of the Iowa forever.''
   Bush recounted seeing the Iowa off the coast of the Philippines
as a naval aviator in World War II, and the great sense of
confidence the big ship lent to the fleet.
   Addressing the children of the victims, he said: ``You must
never forget that your father was America's pride.''
   At the end of the service, while the Navy Hymn was played,
President and Mrs. Bush greeted and consoled the families of the
lost men. After the 45-minute service, the families attended a
private reception with Moosally.
   The Navy said 45 victims' families attended the service.
   At a press briefing following the reception, Moosally praised
the hundreds of men who fought the fire for their courage.
   ``God gave birth to 500 heroes,'' the captain said. ``Fire on a
ship is the most terrifying fear ... you have nowhere to run.
   ``Our extensive training paid off,'' he said. ``Besides the
firefighting crews, we had cooks, engineers, deck seamen, Marines
all fighting to save the ship.''
   Moosally said the blast occurred just as he was turning to Vice
Adm. Jerome Johnson, commander of the 2nd Fleet, to tell him to
watch the No. 2 turret because it contained his best crew.
   ``This was my best turret,'' Moosally said. He said turret chief
Ziegler ``was the most meticulous of men. He was my No. 1 chief of
the 84 chiefs aboard.
   ``Nobody in that turret did anything unless they were
qualified,'' Moosally said.
   Moosally refused to give a definite answer to reporters'
questions about whether the damaged turret could be repaired,
saying the battleship could operate without it if necessary.
   All but 11 men in the huge gun turret died almost instantly last
Wednesday when the explosion ripped through it. At the time, the
Iowa was conducting open seas gun exercises off Puerto Rico.
   The Navy said the investigation into the blast is continuing.
Navy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of the
explosion.
   Cmdr. John P. Morse, the Iowa's weapons officer, said the guns
were thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident, and Moosally
said he had no hesitation about the guns' safety.
   ``I'll be in the turret for the first shot to go off,'' the
captain said.
   One of the survivors, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall L. Truitt,
21, of Tampa, Fla., said that at first the men down in the powder
magazine in the lowest level of the turret didn't know anything was
wrong.
   ``We were waiting for the gun to fire, and we weren't sure,'' he
said. When the men discovered that no one was answering the
interior turret communications link, Truitt ordered the powder
returned to the magazine and the compartment evacuated.
   The sailors found smoke everywhere as they climbed through
hatches and up ladders outside the turret toward the sea deck,
Truitt recalled.
   ``My first thought was that I'd better get to a lifeboat
station, because if the fire got to the magazine things would be
bad,'' he said.

<HEAD>World's Rarest Rhinos Found In War-Ravaged Region Of Vietnam</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Years of war and defoliation in Vietnam failed
to eradicate a small population of the world's rarest rhinoceroses
near Ho Chi Minh City, wildlife officials say.
   An American researcher said Monday that he and a team of
Vietnamese biologists had found tracks of a population of perhaps
10 to 15 Javan rhinoceroses in the eastern part of Vietnam's Song
Be province.
   Since the 1960s the rhinos had been thought extinct except for
about 50 living on the western tip of Java, said George Schaller,
director of Wildlife Conservation International, a division of the
New York Zoological Society.
   ``It was suspected that some still survived in Indochina, but
there was no definite evidence of them,'' Schaller said.
   Live animals were not sighted, but a dead one was found and the
animal's tracks left no doubt about their identification, he said.
   The find is important not only because it improves the survival
odds for the Javan rhinoceros, but also because the rhinos can be
used to encourage preservation of wilderness in Vietnam, Schaller
said.
   ``You may well say that the rhino is a national treasure of
Vietnam,'' he said. ``But the real treasure is the habitat there,
the forest.
   ``Many of these ... charismatic species are in effect symbols,
flagship species, in that they arouse emotions. They motivate a
government to protect an area, because they get popular support.''
   In Vietnam, as elsewhere in Asia, rhino horn is used as a
constituent of many different medicines, Schaller said.
   The dark gray Javan rhinoceros is similar to the African black
rhinoceros, but is chunkier and has heavy skin folds that give it
an armored look. An adult weighs 3,500 pounds, stands 5{ feet tall
and is up to 11{ feet long.
   Schaller, who has tracked endangered animals around the globe,
most recently in China and Tibet, found the rhinos' tracks during
an expedition to Vietnam in February and March.
   He was there with Vo Thanh Son of the University of Hanoi and
Nguyen Yuan Dang and Le Dinh Thuy of Vietnam's national research
council to make the first wildlife survey of Vietnam's southern
forests.
   The tracks were found along the Dong Nai River, 75 miles
northeast of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.
   The region where the rhinos were found is a hot, humid patchwork
of forest, native tribesmen's fields and huge expanses of bamboo up
to 40 feet tall.
   ``The Vietnamese are real conscious of conservation, and I think
they'll make an effort'' to protect the rhinos, Schaller said.
   He recommends stiff penalties for killing and selling rhinos,
and the enlargement of a wilderness reserve near where the
rhinoceroses were found.

   A DC-9 jet carrying 55 passengers was forced to
turn around minutes after takeoff when the pilot discovered flames
shooting from an engine.
   The Midway Airlines twin-engine jet landed safely at Midway
Airport on the city's southwest side with no injuries, said Sandra
Allen, spokeswoman for the airline. The plane had departed for
Kansas City at 8 p.m. and returned to Midway eight minutes later.
   Ms. Allen said a compressor, which mixes air and fuel, failed
and the fuel ignited as it was discharged out of the rear of the
engine.
   She compared it to a car backfiring _ ``a big backfire from a
big engine.''
   ``I'm sure the passengers heard a loud bang and the pilot
noticed a loss of power in the engine,'' Ms. Allen said
   Emergency vehicles were summoned as the plane returned using
only one engine.
   Ms. Allen said the passengers were assigned to other flights to
Kansas City.

<HEAD>Chairman Wants to Eliminate New York's Board of Estimate, Expand
Council</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a commission appointed to rework the
city's unconstitutional government proposed eliminating the
powerful Board of Estimate on Monday and expanding the City Council
to 50 members.
   The mayor would take control of contracts _ a lightning rod in
view of the city corruption scandals surrounding Board of
Estimate-awarded contracts that have resulted in criminal
convictions. However, various bodies would have oversight
responsibilities.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch and City Comptroller Harrison Goldin were
generally pleased by the proposals made by Frederick A.O. Schwarz
Jr., chairman of the Charter Revision Commission.
   The five borough presidents who sit on the Board of Estimate
opposed them, however, with Howard Golden of Brooklyn saying
Schwarz ``is telling the boroughs to drop dead.''
   At a public hearing, Schwarz also put forth the idea of a
bicameral legislature, but not as a formal proposal. He said a new,
19-member house would be the equal of the City Council, but that it
would only work if it gave greater representation to blacks and
Hispanics.
   The commission was created by the mayor to look into ways city
government could restructure itself as court challenges to the
Board of Estimate made their way through the legal system.
   In March, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the board was
unconstitutional because it violated the one-person, one-vote
doctrine by giving each borough equal weight even though they
varied widely in population.
   The commission, which had been on hold pending the court's
ruling, then went into high gear with a self-imposed mandate to get
its proposals on the November ballot.
   The chairman's proposals are the first formal agenda around
which the 15-member commission can debate. Schwarz presented part
of the proposals Monday for discussion with the rest to be reviewed
by the commission Tuesday. His proposals are not final.
   Under his proposals, the powers of the Board of Estimate, made
up of the borough presidents, the mayor, the city council president
and the comptroller, would be dispersed.
   The comptroller no longer would be involved in policy and would
be limited to fiscal matters and oversight and audit functions on
contracts.
   ``I think it is a useful focus for reconstituting the city
government,'' Comptroller Goldin said. ``The comptroller's role has
always been overwhelmingly fiscal. This recognizes that reality.''
   The City Council would expand from 35 to 50 members, with the
districts to correspond as closely as possible to community board
districts. The city council president would continue as an
ombudsman.

   Bette Davis slapped James Cagney and Henry
Fonda, shook Miriam Hopkins, yelled at several leading men and shot
one.
   And between these film clips shown at a Film Society of Lincoln
Center tribute on Monday night, several people who worked with Miss
Davis praised her for her artistry and versatility.
   ``Working with Bette Davis was as happy and rewarding as any
experience I've ever had. Barring grand opera I can't think of
anything beyond her range,'' said Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who wrote
and directed the 1950 movie ``All About Eve.''
   Ann-Margret, Geraldine Fitzgerald and James Stewart also spoke
in honor of Miss Davis during the program at Avery Fisher Hall.
   The actress herself, who spoke last, proved that she still has
verve and the ability to respond to the moment.
   ``I had hoped one day someone would, on one of my award
evenings,'' she began, and was interrupted by laughter. ``Are you
laughing, thinking I'm bragging?'' she asked, then continued,
``would show not only clips from my most well-known films but would
include scenes from my earliest films.''
   That was done, as a scene from the first of Miss Davis' more
than 80 movies was shown. In the brief clip from 1931's ``Bad
Sister,'' Conrad Nagel came in while Miss Davis was powdering a
modestly diapered baby, kissed her and exited.
   Two of the speakers mentioned being warned by others that Miss
Davis could be selfish. Mankiewicz said other writers and directors
predicted he and the star would have a disastrous head-on collision.
   ``Directors said, `She will rewrite and she, not you, will
direct.''' They were wrong, Mankiewicz said.
   Geraldine Fitzgerald, who appeared with Miss Davis in ``Dark
Victory'' in 1939, said she'd been given advice by New York theater
friends.
   ``They said, `She'll turn you around so the camera can only see
your ear. If the set has a lot of furniture, try holding onto
something.'
   ``For the first two or three days I tried to do that. I found
she was always sure I was properly lighted; she was wonderfully
kind and thoughtful, so I stopped. Afrerwards she said she thought
they'd got somebody who was raving mad. We became good friends and
stayed that way.''
   James Stewart acted with Miss Davis once, in ``Right of Way,''
made for TV in 1983. ``I jumped at the chance,'' Stewart said.
``From the first day, it felt just great to be there with Bette on
the set and watch the way this wonderful actress works. I consider
myself very fortunate to have worked with this woman I love and
admire. It means a lot to me to be here tonight.''
   Ann-Margret's first film role, at age 18, was as Miss Davis'
daughter in the 1961 ``Pocketful of Miracles.'' Ann-Margret said,
``Miss Davis was so kind and so caring.
   ``Nobody has matched her intelligence and incredible energy.
There's nothing like watching her entering a scene with her eyes
blazing, ready to stand up for herself or cut somebody else down to
size.''

was final.
   Alvin C. McDougald, 34, of Fort Valley, apparently never filed
the divorce petition of Bobby Eugene Wood.
   Judge Bryant Culpepper said McDougald's actions had been
``fraudulent'' and were ``intentional, willful, wanton and were
taken without regard to the consequences'' to Wood.

<HEAD>Police To Investigate Palestinian Press Cards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev says he has
ordered an investigation into press cards Palestinians are issuing
foreign journalists for the occupied lands, where Israeli police
have posed as reporters.
   Many foreign reporters have acquired such cards since a scandal
last month involving two police officers who were filmed using a
``Press'' sign on their vehicle during a raid against Arab rioters
in east Jerusalem.
   Police later imposed limitations on the practice, but did not
rule it out altogether, saying it was a legitimate decoy method in
dealing with the 16-month Palestinian uprising.
   In addition, Jewish settlers living in the occupied lands have
sometimes used ``Press'' signs to pass unharmed through Palestinian
roadblocks where stone-throwers hurl rocks at cars with the yellow
Israeli license plates.
   Palestinians have alleged that Israeli secret service agents
were also presenting themselves as journalists. Masked Palestinian
activists have often stopped reporters to check their credentials.
   Bar-Lev said on Israel radio Monday that police would look into
the Palestinian-issued press cards.
   ``Those issuing these cards are an organization in Jerusalem,''
he said. ``We will check if it's against the law, and what law, and
what steps can we take against people issuing these cards.''
   Robert Slater, chairman of the Foreign Press Association, said
foreign journalists had to use the Palestinian cards because
Israeli security officials had posed as journalists.
   ``After police were posing as journalists, the Palestinians saw
the Israeli press cards as identifying either a real journalist or
a police agent,'' he said on Israel radio. ``I can understand that
the Palestinians want to make our work easier and give us their
cards.''
   ``It gives them some possibility to check if the man is really a
reporter and we accept it, it makes it easier for us,'' said
Slater, whose organization represents 200 to 300 foreign
journalists posted in Israel.
   ``If a reporter has to get a card from some element, it's not a
violation of some norm but a natural thing in every conflict in the
world ... in Lebanon, in South America,'' he added.
   But Yoram Ettinger, head of the Government Press Office, said
that ``the very acceptance of a Palestinian card in Israel, I
think, is a challenge to Israel's sovereignty.''
   ``As far as I know the card has a map of Palestine from the
Jordan river to the sea which means the elimination of Israel,'' he
said on Israel radio.
   Neither Slater nor Ettinger identified the organization that
produces the press cards. The Israeli news agency Itim said it was
a Jerusalem-based organization called ``Palestinian Press Office.''
   Radwan Abu Ayyash, head of the Arab Journalists' Association
based in east Jerusalem, said his office has been issuing cards for
foreign journalists for the last two years. There is no map on
these cards.
   ``The cards are not a challenge to anybody and have no political
significance whatsoever,'' Abu Ayyash said. ``It has nothing to do
with the uprising or an independent Palestinian state. Moreover,
our association has a license from the Israeli Interior Ministry.''
   He said the cards were issued upon request by foreign reporters
who ``told us, we are harmed by your people, would you do something
to help us and we did.''

   A sports car crashed into a house and
tore through a bedroom but missed the couple sleeping there.
   The car left the street at about 1:30 a.m. Sunday, ran up a
small embankment and hurtled through the air. It glanced off a
pickup truck parked outside the house, crashed through the house
and landed about 35 feet away in a yard next door.
   ``All I heard was a big explosion and glass smashing and the
wall came in and fell on me,'' said Ronald Viator, the owner of the
house. ``If they hadn't hit my pickup, they would have come through
the wall and landed on top of my wife and me.''
   The driver of the car was taken to Jordan Hospital in Plymouth
with cuts and bruises and released. A passenger suffered a broken
breastbone.
   Viator and his wife, Ann, escaped serious injury. Their
children, 9-year-old Jennifer and 5-year-old Jessica, were asleep
in their bedroom in a far corner of the house and were not injured.

   Ambassador McDonald P. Benjamin's
pinstripe pants are wearing a little thin these days. He will miss
his prime minister's arrival from Dominica this weekend because
he'll be flying to Rome, where he doubles as ambassador to Italy.
   Not to worry, says Benjamin, puffing contentedly on his pipe. He
will leave the welcoming ceremonies to the capable hands of his
local embassy staff _ his wife, Angela, and their 25-year-old son,
McDonald Jr.
   Benjamin is the Washington diplomatic representative of the
86,000 people of Dominica (pronounced Dom-i-NEE-ca), a mountainous,
lushly forested island nestled between the French islands of
Guadeloupe and Martinique in the eastern Caribbean.
   His embassy, the smallest in Washington, occupies the Benjamins'
eighth-floor apartment in a high-rise condominium overlooking
suburban Alexandria. His wife says they have ``the best view of any
embassy in Washington.''
   The embassy's only official decoration is the Dominica national
flag, mounted on a six-foot pole in the foyer.
   Dominica is too poor to furnish Benjamin with a chauffeur-driven
limousine, so he drives to his diplomatic appointments in the
family's 1987 Plymouth sedan.
   When the ambassador invites guests to an embassy dinner party,
his German-born wife dons an apron and prepares the food. ``I am
what you call a gourmet cook,'' says Mrs. Benjamin. ``I love to do
my own cooking.''
   Benjamin, 65, a retired economist and official of the
International Fund for Agricultural and Rural Development, a United
Nations agency, has served without pay as Dominica's ambassador to
the United States, Italy and the Food and Agriculture Organization
in Rome since 1986.
   He gets an annual $25,000 expense account to cover the costs of
telephone calls, correspondence and his shuttle flights between
Washington and Rome, where he spends eight months a year. While
he's away, Mrs. Benjamin handles routine embassy affairs, and their
son steps in when they're both traveling.
   ``We get up early and get our work done like any other
embassy,'' Mrs. Benjamin says.
   Benjamin and his wife are staunchly proud of their country,
which gained its independence from Britain in 1978, and their
beloved leader, Mary Eugenia Charles, first female prime minister
of the Caribbean.
   She arrives Sunday for three days of meetings with U.S.
officials, legislators and a private group seeking to raise
$600,000 to rebuild Dominica's Parliament building, which was
destroyed by fire in 1979.
   ``Dominica is one of the most unspoiled and physically one of
the most beautiful countries in the world,'' Benjamin said in a
recent interview.
   The island, 29 miles long and 15 miles wide, contains vast rain
forests, volcanic peaks, waterfalls, hot springs, a cratered
``boiling lake'' and 365 rivers _ one for each day of the year. It
is the home of the world's only Sisserou parrots and the only
full-blooded Carib Indians, and the waters off its southwestern
coast are considered a scuba diver's paradise.
   Benjamin also praises his country's 95 percent literacy rate, a
new highway network, the doubling of Dominica's production of
bananas _ its main export _ an excellent debt-payment record and
plans to build an international airport to spur tourist traffic.
   The ambassador reminds people that he represents the
Commonwealth of Dominica, not the Dominican Republic, even though
his embassy receives phone calls and mail _ some of it top secret _
for the other, much larger Caribbean nation.
   Says Benjamin: ``Whenever I see the ambassador from the
Dominican Republic, I say, `Wouldn't it be a good idea for us to
merge our two embassies? Then we could share our secrets fully'.''

   Police in the southern city of Changsha arrested
98 people, just six of them students, for looting that occurred
during a student demonstration last weekend, an official newspaper
reported today.
   The People's Daily said those arrested were caught looting 28
shops and a shopping arcade Saturday in what the official press
described as the worst rioting in 40 years of Communist rule.
   Rioting also broke out Saturday in the ancient capital of Xian,
with crowds throwing rocks and setting fire to buildings and
vehicles.
   The daily said that of the 98 detained in Changsha, 32 were
workers, 28 were unemployed, 26 were peasants, six were
self-employed and six were students. It said 52 were waiting trial.
   The outbreaks of violence occurred as university students in
Beijing and other cities took to the streets to mourn former
Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, a reformist who died April 15,
and call for democratic reforms.
   In Beijing on Saturday, 150,000 students congregated on
Tiananmen Square in the center of the city for a peaceful
demonstration. Student leaders in Beijing have made efforts to keep
unemployed youth and other potential troublemakers out of their
ranks.
   Most of the other demonstrations have also been peaceful,
although foreign sources said students at the Agricultural College
in Hefei, eastern China, last week smashed windows and furniture in
a campus cafeteria.

<TEXT>
   The ethics case against House Speaker Jim
Wright dominates Capitol Hill conversation, but lawmakers found out
over the weekend that folks back home have other things on their
minds.
   Wright's chief accuser, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., used town
meetings in his suburban Atlanta district to cite repeatedly from
the House ethics committee report charging Wright with 69
violations.
   That was fine, said Bob Norton, a Douglas county real estate
broker. But he was more concerned over sewage and other pollution
in the Chattahoochee River.
   ``I'd be more enthusiastic about Newt if he'd get as much impact
on the environment and our rivers as he did on Jim Wright,'' he
said.
   Politicians found reactions like that were commonplace last
weekend in their first trips home since the ethics committee
announced it had reason to believe Wright had violated House rules.
   The panel, formally known as the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct, issued its equivalent of an indictment of Wright.
It will decide later whether to report actual violations to the
full House for disciplinary action.
   The charges center on allegations that Wright used a sweetheart
publishing deal and bulk book sales to evade House limits on
outside income, and that he accepted gifts from a friend who had an
interest in legislation.
   The committee is continuing to investigate an oil well deal that
netted a big profit for the speaker even though the well was a dud.
   And as a grassroots political topic, many lawmakers are finding
the Wright case is a dud, too.
   Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., said only newspaper reporters
asked her about Wright during her district visit. The freshman
congresswoman handled questions from voters on topics including
trade, fishing and forestry.
   Apparently her tastes mirror her constituents' _ she said she
repeatedly fell asleep when she tried to read the ethics panel
volume.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who has made several television
appearances on the Wright case to take on the speaker's accuser,
received only a single question on the topic at a Wellesley College
forum _ and that was from a professor.
   Paul Barstow, a professor of theater studies, said he was
concerned the Wright case would lead to a ``general perception of
corruption'' among the Democrats.
   Political science major Elizabeth Rosenkrantz, a senior who
helped organize Frank's appearance at the school, said the Wright
case was less important to her than issues such as abortion and the
federal budget.
   ``It doesn't affect me personally,'' she said.
   In Fort Worth, Wright's home district, people probably do take
his performance more personally. There, 79 percent gave him a job
rating of good to outstanding, according to a poll conducted by the
Fort Worth Star Telegram in the days following the ethics committee
report.
   Nationwide polls released today showed Wright to be far from a
front-burner issue.
   A Los Angeles Times poll found more than half the people
responding were ignorant of the charges. A Washington Post poll
found that only a third said they were closely following news about
Wright, and less than 40 percent knew his party.
   However, the same polls showed a strong majority _ 77 percent in
the Post survey _ believed he should resign if the charges against
him are found to be true.
   ``My reaction is to wait on any direct verdict until all the
evidence is in,'' said Kenneth Lakian, a Massachusetts College of
Law student who heard a speech there by Frank. ``I would hope the
public would give Jim Wright his day in court.''
   ``He's guilty as hell'' was the early line from Galen
Rottinghaus, a farmer in Democratic Rep. Jim Slattery's Kansas
district.
   But a Washington Post reporter who spent two days with Slattery
found that the congressman only received a Wright question at about
every other meeting.
   Slattery says when the issue comes before the full House, he
wants to judge Wright on the facts and not on public opinion. But,
he acknowledged, ``if the speaker loses the battle of public
opinion ... that will significantly weaken his political position
back home.''

   A National Transportation Safety Board staff
report recommends several changes in air traffic control operations
over southern California as a result of incidents of airplanes
flying too close together, a board source says.
   The board was taking up the report at its public meeting today
after its investigation into the ``loss of standard separation''
between a British Airways jumbo jet and an American Airlines
jetliner on Feb. 13 over Westminster, Calif.
   The report recommends increases in staff and training at the
Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility in Orange County,
Calif., some improvements and expansion of the facility itself and
several technical changes, the source said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The investigation of the British Airways-American incident was
expanded to cover seven other operational errors over the past year
at the facility just south of Los Angeles. The traffic control
operation handles about half a million flights a year in the skies
between Los Angeles and San Diego, which is one of the busiest
flight areas in the country outside major airport control zones.
   The board meeting on Southern California air traffic control
problems comes two days after two reports of airliners nearly
colliding in the New York area.
   A TWA jumbo jet coming in from London and a commuter plane flew
about 100 feet apart as they approached Kennedy International
Airport on Sunday, and 45 minutes later a Pan Am Boeing 727 en
route from LaGuardia Airport to Boston reported coming within 400
yards of a small Cessna plane near Westchester County Airport.
   The two jetliners in the California incident flew within 1.9
miles of each other, both at 9,000 feet, and Federal Aviation
Administration officials at the time said the British Airways pilot
had to make a hasty turn to avoid a collision.
   Although the planes were not close enough for the incident to be
considered a ``near miss,'' FAA rules say they should have been at
least three miles apart horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically.
   The British Boeing 747 was carrying 286 people from Los Angeles
to London. The American Airlines plane, a British Aerospace 146
with 70 people aboard, was landing at Ontario International Airport
after being diverted from John Wayne airport, whose runway had been
closed due to a power failure.
   The board inquiry is its first major investigation into an air
traffic control operation since the board began recommending
upgrading at Chicago's O`Hare International Airport after
operational errors increased in 1986. O'Hare had more than 30
flight-handling errors in 1988, and the FAA has ordered several
changes, including the hiring of additional controllers.

   If you're waiting for a mail delivery of
illegal drugs, beware the postman. He may be delivering your arrest
warrant.
   With President Bush placing a high priority on eliminating the
``scourge of drugs,'' even the Postal Inspection Service is getting
into the act.
   The service is making arrests on narcotics distribution charges
at more than twice the rate of last year, says Inspector Tom
McClure.
   ``In fiscal 1988, we arrested 425 people for distributing
narcotics through the mail,'' McClure said. ``In the first six
months of this fiscal year, we have arrested 440 people.''
   Among their recent finds were $8,000 worth of PCP packed in baby
food jars and mailed from Los Angeles to Broken Arrow, Okla., and
illicit steroids being distributed by two men in Miami who were
arrested April 17. Officials said that case, the result of a
two-year investigation by postal inspectors and the FBI, was the
largest illicit steroid ring ever busted.
   There are 1,800 postal inspectors, of whom 800 do criminal
investigations including mail fraud, child pornography and internal
theft, McClure said.
   About 50 are assigned to focus on drugs, but when a case comes
along, ``We draw on all the other people in the office. ... We'll
even bring them from across the country if the magnitude of the
case calls for that.''
   Unlike many agencies that announce their seizures and annual
haul of illegal drugs with great fanfare, the Postal Inspection
Service has remained relatively low key. A question about exactly
how many seizures were made and how much in illegal drugs was
seized nationwide in the last fiscal year, for example, was a
stumper.
   ``Well, we've had 440 arrests this year, but we may have had
more seizures such as something being sent to a P.O. box and no one
ever picking it up,'' McClure said.
   He noted that the Postal Inspection Service, which for the most
part works off tips provided by other agencies, generally doesn't
make large seizures compared with other agencies due to the nature
of the mails.
   ``In a boat or a container ship or an airliner, they can move
tons in those kind of things,'' he said. ``In the mail you can't do
that, at least not in an individual package.''
   Often, the mailing of narcotics is not for distribution, just
for the personal use of the recipient, he said.
   Private mail services such as United Parcel Service and Federal
Express are not under the same scrutiny as the U.S. mail. Spokesmen
for both companies said they cooperate with federal and local
authorities on drug investigations, but neither would indicate
exactly how often this has occurred or whether they instigated any
of the probes.
   The Customs Service is cooperating with the Postal Service on a
program in which mail from 29 high-risk drug source countries is
cleared at the port of arrival, according to Dennis Shimkoski of
Customs.
   ``This will prevent ground transfers to inland destinations,
eliminates potention monkey business,'' he said.
   Already, Customs has seized record quantities of drugs at 21
international mail branches. In fiscal 1988, Customs seized 164
pounds of heroin, 1,600 pounds of opium and 1,310 pounds of
marijuana. There were no significant amounts of cocaine mailed,
Shimkoski said.
   In the first half of fiscal 1989, Customs seized 65 pounds of
heroin, 216 pounds of opium, 10 pounds of cocaine and 297 pounds of
marijuana at the mail branches. He said the numbers may appear to
be low compared with the previous year ``but there tends to be a
pickup when you get into the warmer months.''

universities in 35 states who competed in the 19th National
Forensic Association Individual Events Tournament. The five-day
competition ended Monday with finals in the nine events _
after-dinner speaking, prose, poetry, informative, persuasive,
rhetorical criticism, impromptu, extemporaneous and dual drama
interpretation.
   Jones, a Cornell University student, won the impromptu category
and the pentathlon award for his scoring in at least five events.
   His impromptu speech was on the quote, ``Poets are mysteriously
silent about cheese.''
   He said that he thought the author, G.K. Chesterson, meant poets
have trouble explaining the concrete and mundane aspects of life.
Then he disagreed with Chesterson.
   A tricky assignment, but one that Jones said will serve him well
next year as a law student at Harvard University.
   ``It's a really good preparation for law school because it's the
kind of thing that prepares you to interact with people,'' Jones
said. ``We have to persuade to win. It's not enough to just seem
impressive.''
   An after-dinner speech on the fear of homosexuals helped Jeff
Sculley of Bradley University win a national forensics title while
teammate Sarah Braun won two events _ poetry and dual drama with
Jim Farruggio. The Illinois university took home the sweepstakes
award for most points accumulated by a school, its fourth such
title in six years.
   Other winners were Stephanie Kaplan, University of
Wisconsin-Madison, rhetorical criticism; Joey Callow, Miami
University of Ohio, informative; Robert Andanto, Arizona State,
prose; Mike Jakoby, Bradley, extemporaneous; and Betsy Heffernan,
University of Wisconsin-Madison, persuasion.
   ``Despite the pressures on university budgets, forensics is
something strong. ... This is a way a university shows off what it
does in the classroom,'' said tournament director Christina
Reynolds, of the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.
   Well-known personalities who have competed in forensics include
President Bush, television talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and actress
Shelley Long, according to tournament literature.
   The audience sitting on folding chairs in the Upsala College
gymnasium Monday laughed loudly at the 10-minute, after-dinner
speeches of six finalists.
   Diana Gering, a senior speech communications major from Mankato
State University in Minnesota, said she enjoyed the competition
because ``you get a chance to perform.''
   The 22-year-old's after-dinner performance charmed some.
   ``I represent the non-conformists of the world,'' Ms. Gering
told the audience. ``I don't do lunch. I eat my food, thank you.''

<HEAD>St Paddy's Surprise: Three Mile Island Siren Jolted Residents</HEAD>

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission wants to
know why a warning siren blared for 50 minutes near the Three Mile
Island nuclear plant on St. Patrick's Day, frightening residents
enough that some began to pack their belongings.
   The siren was heard by residents of York, Pa., late in the
evening of March 17 _ 11 days before the 10th anniversary of the
nation's worst commercial accident at the plant. During the
accident, pregnant women and preschoolers had been advised to
evacuate within five miles of the two reactors.
   James R. Sutton said he, his wife and two children thought it
was an ``odd time for a test'' when they were awakened by the siren
last month at 11:20 p.m. It lasted until 12:10 a.m., and the couple
said they could get no information from neighbors, television and
radio stations, or the police on the reason why.
   ``Unless you were involved, you cannot realize the anxiety and
concern for the health of your family while the siren was sounding,
nor can you share my anger at not being able to find out what was
happening,'' Sutton said in a March 23 letter to the NRC's Advisory
Committee on Reactor Safeguards.
   ``Those 50 minutes seemed like hours to me, my family and our
neighbors,'' he said. ``Some of the neighbors began to pack up and
leave the area. Even after the siren stopped, we had no idea if
there was a problem.''
   The advisory panel said it considered Sutton's letter serious
enough to warrant an investigation by the NRC staff and GPU
Nuclear, the plant operator.
   ``Events of the type described in Mr. Sutton's letter reflect
poorly on the industry's emergency planning efforts,'' Forrest
Remick, chairman of the advisory panel, said in a letter to the NRC
on April 13.
   Three Mile Island officials are not sure why the alarm was
sounded. The sirens are maintained by the utility, but are also
used by York County officials for other local emergencies not
related to the plant.
   Once it began, the siren is supposed to be able to be shut off
by remote control. But when that failed on March 17, the utility
had to call a contractor to drive to the site and shut it off by
hand, according to GPU Nuclear spokeswoman Mary Wells.
   ``Fifty minutes when you're listening in the middle of the night
is a long time,'' Wells said. ``When you're us and you have to find
out what the problem is, it's not that long. I'm sure it was for
him (Sutton).''
   The most frustrating thing, Sutton said Monday in a telephone
interview, is that he and his neighbors followed emergency
procedures by tuning to designated television and radio stations _
but still could get no information.
   An NRC official looking into the incident recently told Sutton's
wife that information was indeed available from one radio station
``but I guess we don't listen to them,'' he said.

   Government will have to curtail domestic farm
production if the United States falls behind in world agriculture
markets, says the dean of agriculture at Purdue University.
   ``If we're not competitive, we're talking about downsizing
agriculture,'' Dr. Robert Thompson told Congress' Joint Economic
Committee on Monday.
   International trade has arisen as one of the most important
considerations for lawmakers working on the 1990 farm bill, which
will decide government policies for years to come.
   J.B. Penn, vice president of Sparks Commodities, Inc., told the
committee that technology, which was the issue of previous decades,
has successfully increased farm production.
   Future domestic demand will grow only slightly, creating a need
to pursue foreign markets, he said.
   Former agriculture secretary Bob Bergland, who now heads the
National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, said farm yields
are increasing all over the world, making other countries less
dependent on the United States.
   ``We're not the lowest cost producer,'' Bergland said. He said
Brazil produces soybeans cheaper than the United States and New
Zealand is the world's most efficient dairy producer.
   Lawmakers are also looking into the Export Enhancement Program,
which provides subsidies for U.S. farm exports to make them less
expensive abroad.
   On Monday, at a conference for agriculture reporters, Rep. Dan
Glickman, D-Kan., said he believes the the Office of Management and
Budget has put EEP on hold.
   He said OMB has refused to give its consent to any new sales
under the program since the end of February.
   Glickman, who chairs the House Agriculture soybean and wheat
subcommittee, said President Bush defended the importance of the
export subsidy program during his campaign and Agriculture
Secretary Yeutter also has supported it. The OMB appears to be in
conflict with the rest of the administration, the congressman said.
   The OMB has scheduled a meeting to review the program, but
denies that it has suspended it.
   Last week, Sen. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., raised the same concern
voiced by Glickman and sent a letter to the OMB saying there should
be no further delays in EEP sales. A spokesman for Kerrey's office
said Monday the budget office had not responded.
   Both Kerrey and Glickman said the Export Enhancement Program is
essential to U.S. strength at trade talks in Geneva where American
negotiators are trying to get countries around the world to remove
or reduce subsidies on agricultural products.

<HEAD>Court to Rule on Federal Judge's Authority to Impose Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court will decide whether a
federal judge may order local taxes to be raised in order to pay
for racially balanced schools, in the first desegregation case the
court has heard for years.
   The justices announced on Monday they will rule on tax increases
ordered by U.S. District Judge Russell Clark in Kansas City, Mo.
The increases are designed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars
to improve decaying, predominantly black schools in the city.
   The last time the court heard arguments and ruled on
desegregation efforts was in 1982, in cases from Seattle and Los
Angeles.
   In the Kansas City case, the court will hear an appeal by state
officials that Clark exceeded his authority.
   The city's schools were segregated by Missouri state law until
1954. From 1954 to 1984 the percentage of black students in the
city climbed from 22.5 to 67.7 percent.
   Clark ruled in 1987 that the school facilities had ``literally
rotted'' and ordered them upgraded.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld most of Clark's
ruling last August.
   The appeals court said, ``There are still vestiges of the dual
school system lingering in the (city school district), and the
district and the state have not met their obligations to
disestablish that system.''
   Clark ordered creation of so-called magnet schools, providing
that by the 1991-92 school year every high school and middle school
in the city, and about half the elementary schools, will offer
distinctive areas of concentration such as foreign languages,
performing arts or math and science.
   The judge also called for capital improvements costing some $260
million to be completed by the fall of 1990.
   To enable the city school district to pay its share of the
desegregation plan's costs, the judge imposed a 1.5 percent income
tax surcharge and raised school district property taxes to $4 per
$100 assessed valuation through the 1991-92 fiscal year.
   State officials said the $4 per $100 levy represented a doubling
of the local property tax.
   Clark ordered the tax increases because no money was available
to finance the construction of new schools. Between 1970 and 1983,
school district voters had turned down six proposals to increase
taxes for education.
   He also authorized the school district to issue $150 million in
20-year capital improvement bonds.
   The 8th Circuit court upheld the property tax increase but
struck down the income tax surcharge, which had raised some $30
million before being invalidated.
   The state was ordered to pay 75 percent of the desegregation
costs and the school district the remainer.
   In other action Monday, the Supreme Court:
   _Refused to intervene in the controversy over Alar, rejecting
attempts to revive a lawsuit aimed at banning the chemical some say
makes eating apples a health hazard. The justices, without comment,
turned down an appeal by Ralph Nader, environmentalists and others
who want Alar off the market.
   _Refused to lift a freeze on the assets of deposed Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda. The court left
intact a ruling that requires the Marcoses to defend themselves in
a lawsuit by the Philippine government while barring them from
transferring most of their alleged vast wealth.
   _Left intact a $101 million refund the nation's telephone
companies were ordered to pay customers for excessive charges in
1978. The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the
Federal Communications Commission overstepped its authority in
ordering the refunds.
   _Agreed to consider reinstating the death sentence of a
convicted Oklahoma killer whose jury was told to ``avoid any ...
sympathy'' for the defendant when sentencing him.

<TEXT>
   Some officials in the Bush administration say
public confidence in the nation's food system needs a lift.
   Cooper Evans, White House special assistant for agricultural
affairs, says a new interagency task force has been formed to
``examine our policies in this whole area'' of food safety and make
recommendations for changes, if any are needed.
   Evans, a former Republican congressman from Iowa, told a meeting
of farm journalists on Monday that the task force includes
representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food
and Drug Administration and the Agriculture Department.
   ``We're going to take a good look at what we're doing now and
what we might (be doing) in the future to increase public
confidence and to ensure that our programs ... remain the best,''
Evans said.
   Speaking earlier to the same group, the National Association of
Agricultural Journalists, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
said that sensationalism and misleading news stories about food
safety can hurt consumers when accurate information is needed most.
   Yeutter cited recent cases involving potential food supply
hazards. One of those was about chemicals such as Alar used in
apple production.
   A recent study by a private environmental group, the Natural
Resources Defense Council, suggested that children may be exposed
to dangerous levels of carcinogenic chemicals in fruits and
vegetables because they eat large amounts in proportion to their
weight.
   The council's study singled out Alar, and alarms were raised
throughout the country about the possible hazards of eating apples.
   Government regulatory agencies, including the Environmental
Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture
Department, said there was no need to panic and that there was no
reason for parents to keep apples from children.
   ``We need to make sure that these volatile issues are handled as
well as possible from a communications standpoint,'' he said.
``Obviously, we have freedom of the press in this country, and the
media can do what it wishes in this area _ just as it does in other
areas.''
   Yeutter added: ``And if folks choose to provide coverage for
misleading research studies or choose to distort or sensationalize,
they're privileged to do so, that's the price we pay for a
democratic society.''
   In the meantime, Yeutter said he hoped ``we can do an effective
job of keeping these issues in proper balance.''
   One reporter asked what Yeutter meant by ``proper balance'' in
news reports.
   ``That means making sure that the facts are out, and not simply
someone's distorted interpretation of what they read, see or
hear,'' he said.
   The Agriculture Department, which sometimes in the past has been
accused of sticking up for farm interests at the expense of
consumers and environmentalists, needs to have a spotless
reputation on such sensitive issues, Yeutter said.
   ``We're going to play it straight in the department in these
areas, and I hope we can establish a reputation for credibility on
all fronts,'' he said. ``If we say something about an Alar
stituation, or we say something about any other food safety
question, my intent is that we do it in such a way that it will
command the respect of everyone who views that issue or evaluates
it in any way.''
   Yeutter said he wants USDA ``to have the respect'' of both sides
of an issue.
   In the case of Alar and the Natural Resource Defense Council's
report which triggered the apple scare, Yeutter said that ``great
attention in the media was given to a study that had not been
subjected to peer review.'' He said the study had been superseded
by other research, which had been subjected to review.
   ``None of that seemed to emerge in the media treatment of that
issue in its initial stages,'' and the result, he said, was
``sensationalism and a distortion of the facts.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rising price for the yen and an increase in
wages have driven the cost of labor in Japanese industry to 95
percent of the U.S. cost last year, when reckoned in dollars,
according to the latest figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
   The average cost per hour was $13.90 in the United States and
$13.14 in Japan.
   Low wages in Japan were often cited in the past as a reason for
Japan's ability to sell its goods. In dollar terms, the average
cost of a worker was only half the cost in the United States as
recently as 1985. Since then, the price of the yen has risen fast:
it took 238 yen to buy a dollar in 1985; last year the average
price was only 128 yen.
   Costs are put in dollar terms so that they can be compared from
one country to the next. When the dollar cost of a country's goods
goes up, as Japan's cost has done, its goods become more expensive
and _ in theory at least _ harder to sell on world markets compared
with the goods of its competitors.
   ``The dollar cost is the only one that people use when figuring
how competitive a country is,'' Robert M. Dunn Jr, professor of
economics at George Washington University, said in an interview
Monday.
   In practice, Japan still sold $77 billion worth of goods last
year beyond what it bought. The United States had the opposite
situation, a trade deficit of more than $152 billion.
   Michael Evans of Evans Economics Inc., who makes weekly
worldwide forecasts from Washington, cited other figures from the
Labor Department to show that Japanese labor cost in the auto
industry as still only 75 percent of the cost in the United States.
He saw that as a major reason for continued high U.S. imports and
low exports.
   ``It is almost certain that the 1989 figures will show a further
deterioration in our trade deficit,'' he wrote in a comment on the
Labor Department figures.
   The amounts Japanese employers pay for labor have been steadily
increasing in Japanese terms as well, from an average of 904 yen an
hour in 1975, then equal to only $3.05, to 1,685 yen last year or
$13.14. This translates into even greater purchasing power for
Japanese wage-earners, since Japanese price rises have been smaller
than in any other big industrial country.
   Writers have been pointing out recently that these increases
still leave the standard of living low for many Japanese, compared
with the United States and West European countries.
   In West Germany, Norway and Switzerland labor costs were 30
percent to 40 percent higher last year than in the United States.
They were 10 percent to 20 percent higher in Belgium, Denmark,
Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden.
   ``That should mean more exports and fewer imports for the United
States, though the dollar has been going up again this year,'' said
Art Nees, in charge of international comparisons at the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.
   ``But it takes time for the effects to show.''

<HEAD>US Fails to Resolve Missile Differences with West Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has rejected a plea by West
Germany to hold negotiations with the Soviet Union on reducing
battlefield nuclear missiles and instead will proceed with work to
improve the weapons.
   The dispute, which is causing strains within the NATO alliance,
was aired for nearly four hours Monday by high-level West German
and American delegations.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg then headed back to Bonn to bring the
bad news to Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Kohl's political future could be clouded by failure to persuade
the Americans to open negotiations with Moscow on the U.S.-built
Lance missiles.
   The West German electorate is turning more toward disarmament,
and the left-leaning Social Democrats and Greens are gaining ground
in the polls against Kohl's own Christian Democrats. Local
elections are being held in June.
   Before leaving for Bonn, however, Genscher and Stoltenberg told
German reporters the talks were ``encouraging.'' They did not
elaborate.
   Kohl's formal presentation will be made in his governmental
declaration to the West German parliament on Thursday.
   Among the Americans at the meeting Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Brent Scowcroft,
the president's assistant for national security affairs.
   Cheney made it clear before the meeting that the United States
would oppose reducing short-range nuclear missile strength while
the Soviets hold an advantage in non-nuclear forces in Europe.
   Baker said through a spokeswoman he understood ``the Federal
Republic's problem regarding the timing of any such decision'' to
modernize. Kohl also was seeking a delay in plans to extend the
range of the Lance missiles.
   The meeting was hastily arranged Friday, when Kohl called Bush.
   Unless the issue is resolved, it could disrupt the summit
meeting Bush will attend at the end of May with the leaders of the
15 other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries in Brussels.
   Kohl's domestic concerns conflict with the determined drive by
the United States, Britain and France to keep the Lances on West
German soil.
   Genscher and Stoltenberg gave no indication as they left the
State Department whether they had made any headway.
   Baker issued a brief statement that described the meeting as
``useful and friendly.'' He said the discussions would be continued
``in an effort to reach an agreement within the alliance.''
   ``Secretary Baker has said many times that it would be
preferable if we could move to modernize our short-range nuclear
weapons, although we understand the Federal Republic's problem
regarding the timing of any such decision,'' State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said as the parties met. ``And he has
said that we think it would be a mistake to engage in arms control
negotiations on SNF (Short-range Nuclear Forces).''
   Cheney, speaking at the National Defense University before the
meeting, said negotiating at this point with the Soviets over the
missiles would be a mistake because of their overwhelming
superiority in non-nuclear forces.
   ``For the foreseeable future, certainly as long as there is
overwhelming Soviet conventional superiority,'' the defense
secretary said, ``there's absolutely no rationale at all for us to
talk about eliminating or significantly reducing those short-range
forces.''
   Cheney said the United States would proceed with ``early work''
to improve the Lance missile system. ``It does not require a firm
commitment, now, or a specific decision, now, by a specific
government,'' he said.
   Opponents of the missiles are concerned that having an arsenal
of Lances is an incentive to use them, and that any nuclear
conflict between East and West would spread to a world-threatening
war.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will fly to Bonn on
Sunday to try to persuade Kohl to suspend his campaign for
U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the issue.
   Kohl has support among several of the smaller NATO countries,
including Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.

   Carriage drivers are raising a stink over a city
plan to clean up the streets by putting horses in diapers.
   ``The people proposing this don't know one end of a horse from
the other,'' said driver Alan Nugent.
   Sitting behind a gray beauty named Rover, Nugent was one of more
than 30 drivers who rode their carriages Monday to a hearing to
protest the plan.
   Drivers say the diapers _ reusable vinyl sacks strapped to a
horse's rear _ leak, smell bad, attract flies and bees and can
cause sores and infections. They also say all mares would have to
be replaced because their anatomy cannot tolerate the diapers.
   ``We feel it's inhumane,'' said carriage owner Randy Grill, who
testified at the hearing while drivers chanted ``Clean up crime,
not horse manure.''
   The New York Horse and Carriage Association pays $2,000 a month
to a private sanitation service to remove manure from Central
Park's carriage routes. Grill said drivers would be willing to pay
to double the cleanup effort if the city dropped the diaper idea.
   Dr. Fay Smimmo, a veterinarian consulting for the Department of
Parks and Recreation, said the diapers shouldn't bother horses if
adjusted properly. Many of the diapers are made by Amish
communities where horses are used everyday, she said, and special
models are available for mares.
   Smimmo said diapers are used successfully by horses in Montreal,
Atlanta, Denver, Philadelphia and New Orleans.
   ``When I first heard about the diaper idea, I thought, what a
stupid thing. But then when I started talking to drivers around the
country, they said it works fine,'' she said.
   The diapers are scheduled to go into use May 1.

   Privacy was hard to come by in their parking
lot home, but a brown killdeer successfully hatched a family in
front of a group of birdwatchers.
   Decoy tactics by her mate drew little attention as those who had
marveled at the nest witnessed the hatching of four eggs Friday.
   Last month, the killdeer and her mate spent about 10 days
digging out their nest in the mobile home parking lot.
   Oversized trucks and mobile homes moved within feet of the nest,
but the mother did not abandon her duty unless the male took over.
Although both parents shooed away curious humans, the first two
plum-sized baby birds sneaked out and, on wobbly legs, scampered
inches toward an onlooker.
   ``Last week she took off and he sat on the eggs awhile,'' said
Tommy Karr, a bird-watcher and employee at Sonshine Homes, where
the birds hatched.
   Co-worker James Weekley added: ``She'll be glad when the baby
birds are gone. I'll bet she'll never come here again.''
   After the chicks hatched, the killdeer family escaped to the
edge of the parking lot, Karr said Monday. He said he has seen the
parents, but the babies ``are nowhere to be found.''
   The brown killdeer has orange markings and typically is a shore
bird. About 10 inches long, it runs on long, spindly legs and often
nests in gravel.

<HEAD>Former CIA Station Chief Indicted Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former CIA agent was indicted anew on
charges he lied about helping the Nicaraguan Contras, but a
conspiracy allegation was omitted for apparently the same reason
such an accusation was dropped against Oliver L. North.
   Six months after charges against Joseph F. Fernandez were
dismissed on a legal technicality, a new indictment against the
former station chief in Costa Rica was returned Monday. Missing was
the charge that he conspired to deliver arms to the Contras when
such aid was banned by Congress.
   The original conspiracy charge alleged that Fernandez worked
with former National Security Council aide Oliver L. North and arms
dealer Richard V. Secord to set up the covert arms-supply network.
   The new indictment focused on charges that Fernandez lied to
obstruct inquiries of the CIA's inspector general and the
presidential commission headed by former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas,
that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   James Wieghart, a spokesman for prosecutor Lawrence Walsh,
refused to comment on why the conspiracy charge was not contained
in the new indictment.
   But it appeared that Walsh decided not to pursue that
arms-resupply allegation because it was fraught with the same
secrecy concerns that forced him to drop similar charges against
North.
   Earlier this year, Walsh dropped charges that North conspired
with others to divert $15 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to
the Nicaraguan rebels when the government refused to release secret
documents the trial judge ruled were needed for North's defense.
   A federal court jury in Washington is deliberating on 12 related
charges against North, including allegations he lied to Congress
about the Iran-Contra affair.
   Legal observers have considered the Fernandez case even more
laden with secrecy problems because his lawyers are expected to
seek court approval to disclose details of his CIA activities in
Central America, where he used the alias Tomas Castillo.
   Walsh avoided those issues by obtaining a narrow indictment
charging that Fernandez lied when he denied he helped set up the
airstrip in northern Costa Rica for the resupply operation and said
he did not know that North was involved in the effort.
   Fernandez is also accused of lying to the CIA by stating that
the airstrip was built by the Costa Rican government to train
pilots for a possible Nicaraguan invasion of Costa Rica.
   Each of four charges in the indictment carries a maximum
five-year sentence and a $250,000 fine upon conviction.
   The original five-count indictment, brought in Washington, was
dismissed Oct. 19 after a judge ruled the charges should have been
brought in Virginia because Fernandez was questioned at CIA
headquarters in Langley, Va., just across the Potomac River.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. gave Walsh the option
of bringing the charges again in federal court in Alexandria.
Fernandez is to appear there May 1 for arraignment before U.S.
District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr.

   The Who just can't stop talking about their
generation.
   The legendary British rock group plans to celebrate their
founding 25 years ago with their first tour in more than six years.
   ``We felt like we weren't trying to resurrect the band. This is
a celebration of the music we created, after all these years,''
lead singer Roger Daltrey said Monday.
   Daltrey joined composer-guitarist Peter Townshend and bassist
John Entwistle in announcing the planned tour of 25 North American
cities this summer. It will be their first since a ``Farewell
Tour'' of 1982-83.
   The band rode to fame a generation ago with the hit ``My
Generation,'' a teen-protest song that included the line, ``Hope I
die before I get old.''
   They're now in their 40s, with Townshend acknowledging he has
impaired hearing. And they haven't played together since a brief,
rusty appearance at Live Aid in 1985.
   Does the band's chemistry still exist?
   ``We don't know whether it's still there or what it is or where
it comes from. We're going to get in the rehearsal studio and see
what happens,'' Townshend said.
   Drummer Simon Phillips will join the group, and there also will
be a keyboardist, horn player, percussion section and backup
singers. The original Who drummer, Keith Moon, died in 1978.
   The tour will include two full-length performances of the rock
opera ``Tommy,'' with guest stars, in New York City and Los
Angeles. The latter concert will be videotaped. Proceeds from those
concerts and the video will benefit the Nordoff-Robbins Music
Therapy Foundation for autistic children.
   The band last performed ``Tommy,'' by Townshend, in its entirety
17 years ago in Chicago.
   The Who will play concerts with an intermission for the first
time. ``I don't know if that says anything about age,'' said
Townshend, 43. The band will play at least three hours, performing
music from the group's albums as well as the artists' solo efforts.
   Daltrey said they had decided against making an album to be
released while they're touring.
   ``One of the reasons we stopped is we were on that
album-tour-album-tour rat race of the rock 'n' roll industry. To
come back and do all that again we thought was a mistake,'' he said.
   Of his hearing problem, Townshend said: ``It's a ringing in the
ears at the kind of frequencies at which I play the guitar. ... If
I expose myself to loud electric guitar, particularly my own, my
hearing suffers.''
   ``I'm still very nervous about how I can work on stage without
further damage to my hearing,'' he said, but then drew a laugh by
adding: ``We're going to play very, very quietly.''
   Scheduled stops are: Toronto June 24; East Rutherford, N.J.,
June 29; Hartford, Conn., July 4; Montreal, July 5; Washington,
D.C., July 7; Philadelphia, July 9; Foxboro, Mass., July 12;
Pittsburgh, July 16; Buffalo, N.Y., July 18; Cleveland, July 19;
East Troy, N.Y., July 21; Pontiac, Mich., July 25; and Raleigh,

<HEAD>Animal Research Protests Begin with 58 Arrested at NIH</HEAD>

   Police arrested 58 flag-waving,
slogan-chanting animal rights activists after they blocked traffic
in a busy intersection and forced open a door at the National
Institutes of Health.
   ``This is the first step in voicing your opinion and letting it
be known that people are opposed to this kind of cruelty to
animals,'' said Zakki Jewad, 25, of Silver Spring, Md.
   Organizers said the aim of the demonstration in this Washington
D.C. suburb was to kick off a week of civil disobedience and
rallies at research centers and universities nationwide.
   ``We're protesting the murders of millions of animals in
research laboratories every year,'' said Lee Warren, 61, of
Baltimore, who came to Monday's rally toting a sign and dressed in
a full-length black cape and hood to represent death.
   During the demonstration, about 200 activists gathered on NIH's
grassy lawn for speeches and vegetarian lunches. NIH was targeted
for the demonstration because it is the largest funding source for
animal research, protesters said.
   Police arrested 37 activists after they linked hands and blocked
traffic on a busy street for about 30 minutes. Officers dragged
many across the road to allow traffic to get by. They were charged
with disobeying a police officer and were released at the scene,
according to Montgomery County police.
   Following the arrests, the protesters proceeded to NIH's main
administration building where they began to pound on doors and
windows of the facility. One of the doors broke open and police
arrested 21 of the protestors and charged them with trespassing.
Some also were charged with breaking and entering, according to NIH
officials.
   ``I really feared for the safety of the building,'' said Dr.
William Raub, NIH Deputy Director. ``That group was absolutely out
of control.''
   Ginger Redmon, who said she had been arrested in two other
animal rights protests, said the civil disobedience ``shows we have
a strong commitment.''
   Raub denied that animals were mistreated at NIH. ``It's a
fabricated story from start to finish,'' he said. ``There's no
basis for that claim.''
   To defend their research, medical and scientific experimenters
plan to use this week to speak out in support of the use of animals
in medical research, pointing to the medical breakthroughs such
research has brought _ from coronary bypass surgery to cataract
removal, from vaccines to antibiotics.
   ``There's no such thing as anybody not having received some
benefit from animal research,'' said Frankie Trull, president of
the Foundation for Biomedical Research, a nonprofit group that
supports animal research.
   Animal research defenders also say most laboratory experiments
aren't painful and about 90 percent of the animals used in such
research are rodents bred specifically for lab experimentation.
   But Ingrid Newkirk, director of People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals, said too much money goes toward unnecessary animal
research.
   She estimated that the federal government spends as much as $6
billion a year on research using animals and said the same results
could be derived in ways that don't harm or kill animals.
   ``When it comes to feelings, they (scientists) believe that a
rat is nothing more than a test tube,'' Newkirk said.

<HEAD>Trust Fund Will Financed for Next Three Decades</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Social Security old age and disability
trust funds are financially sound and should be able to pay
benefits until nearly the middle of the next century, according to
a report to Congress.
   The report by the trustees of the Social Security system
projected that income to the Old Age and Survivors and Disability
Insurance Trust Funds will exceed benefits paid out for the next
three decades.
   After that, the combined trust funds will run a deficit until
funds are exhausted in 2046.
   ``However, the expected accumulation of the trust funds during
the next 20 to 30 years provides ample time to monitor the
financial status of the program and to take corrective action at
some time in the future,'' the report said.
   The report was signed by members of Social Security's Board of
Trustees, which includes Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Health Secretary Louis Sullivan and
Social Security Commissioner Dorcas Hardy.
   In this calendar year, the two funds combined will take in about
$294 billion and will pay out about $236 billion. About 130 million
workers will be covered by the program this year.
   The assets of the funds increased by $41 billion in calendar
year 1988 from the previous year, in part because of the growth in
the nation's economy, the report said.
   Based on intermediate economic and demographic assumptions, the
combined trust funds are expected to swell to a level about five or
six times the annual amount paid in benefits in the next 20 to 30
years, the report said.
   Under the worst conditions, combined funds would be expected to
increase to about two-and-a-half times annual payout during the
next 20 to 25 years, the report said. However, the report said,
financial problems could occur within the next 10 years in the
Disability Insurance Trust Fund under these conditions.
   The Old Age and Survivors Insurance program pays benefits after
a worker retires and to survivors after a worker dies. Disability
Insurance pays benefits after a worker becomes disabled.

<HEAD>Bush Says Foreign Policy, Environmental Decisions Coming Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush seems eager to look to the ``long
road ahead'' as he rounds out 100 days in office, pledging to use
the next several weeks to complete a detailed foreign policy
review, draft environmental legislation and intensify his war on
drugs.
   In all that he does, Bush pledged Monday in a speech at the
annual meeting of The Associated Press, he intends to work closely
with Congress. ``I think the work we've done these past three
months demonstrates the value of tough, principled negotiation''
with the Democratic majorities of the House and Senate, he told
newspaper publishers gathered for the session.
   Bush's speech was the final act of rare back-to-back appearances
by the president and vice president.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, who spoke to the AP meeting two hours
earlier, said the biggest surprise of his first 100 days in
national office was the enjoyment he receives from foreign travel
and participating in foreign policy discussions.
   Quayle, who is off on a long trip to Australia and Asia, noted
that as a senator most of his travel was back and forth between
Washington and his home state of Indiana.
   In his remarks, Bush pledged he would follow ``every
intelligence lead'' in attempts to secure freedom for AP Middle
Eastern correspondent Terry Anderson. Anderson has been held
captive for more than four years since being abducted in Beirut.
   The president told his audience he wasn't able to ``give you any
good news'' about the prospects for Anderson's release. But, he
said, ``we will go the extra mile and do everything we can.''
   Bush summarized his first 100 days in office _ which end on
Saturday _ by saying he is ``off to a good start ... and there's
more to come.''
   ``So while I'm pleased with all we've accomplished in these
three months, there's a long road ahead of us,'' he said.
   ``I'm optimistic that our reforms will produce lasting results,
that the long-range planning we do today will pay off in the
future.''
   Bush identified several key issues as being ``on the near
horizon.''
   They include completion of a defense and foreign policy review,
which will include decisions on arms control that presumably will
pave the way for the next round of negotiations with the Soviet
Union.
   ``We are mapping strategies for a period of remarkable change in
international affairs,'' he said, ``change more wide-ranging and
rapid than at any time in the postwar period.''
   Bush did not mention recent complaints from Soviet officials
that his new administration is missing an opportunity for progress
by moving too slowly to address arms control and other U.S.-Soviet
issues. Instead, he said Secretary of State James Baker has met
with Soviet Leader Eduard Shevardnadze and will do so again next
month.
   Also on Bush's list for the immediate future are legislation to
strengthen the Clean Air Act, attack homelessness and curb the
increased use of lethal weapons by drug dealers, he said.
   Summarizing his first 100 days as president, Bush cited
agreements with Congress on a deficit-reduction package that avoids
tax increases and on providing non-lethal aid to the Contra rebels.
   He also ticked off several proposals he has made, including
legislation to bail out the savings and loan industry and to
strengthen ethics in government.
   In addition, he said his crackdown on drugs had begun with a
first-of-its-kind attack on the problems in Washington D.C. and the
decision to ban the import of certain types of semiautomatic
weapons.
   He also took credit for legislation to restrict the export of
hazardous wastes, and said he has launched an initiative to deal
with the debt owed to developed nations by the Third World.
   Most of Quayle's AP speech was devoted to looking ahead to his
Asian and Australian trip, including a pledge to maintain the
United States as a great Pacific power.
   The vice president fielded questions after his prepared speech
and said his first three months in office have given him a close-up
view of the office of the presidency.
   ``I work every day in close quarters with President Bush,'' he
said. ``I see how he formulates his policies. I'm there to give my
opinion.''

   A second effort to impose a youth curfew as
part of an effort to curb the drug trade in the District of
Columbia again failed to pass constitutional muster in a federal
court.
   Hours before it was to take effect late Monday, U.S. District
Judge Charles H. Richey blocked enforcement of the curfew for at
least 10 days pending a further hearing.
   ``There are serious First, Fourth and Fifth amendment concerns
raised in this issue,'' Richey said, mentioning the constitutional
safeguards of the right of assembly, reasonable search and seizures
and due process.
   The bill, which would have required people under age 18 to be
off the city's streets, sidewalks and other public spaces by 11
p.m. Sunday through Thursday and midnight Friday and Saturday, with
some exceptions, was to have taken effect for 90 days at 11 p.m.
Monday.
   The D.C. Council had approved the curfew April 4, amending a
broader bill struck down by Richey on March 20.
   Arthur B. Spitzer, legal director for the American Civil
Liberties Union, argued that no curfew could prevent youths from
becoming involved with drugs and crime.
   ``It's absurd to think a youngster who's out dealing drugs and
carrying a gun is going to go home and go to bed when the clock
strikes 11,'' said Spitzer, who represents 15 plaintiffs.
   Spitzer said the curfew bill discriminates against poorer
juveniles and defines the word ``parent'' too strictly, ruling out
other adult relatives or friends. Spitzer pointed out that
employers, not employees, are required by law to possess youths'
work permits.
   Assistant corporation counsel Victor Long told Richey the D.C.
Council adopted the ``least restrictive measure'' it could to
tackle juvenile crime. The law would not infringe on constitutional
rights, he said, but rather would place ``reasonable restraints''
for ``a valid reason,'' he said.
   Under the law, police would take violators to the nearest police
station and call their parents. The first violation would not
result in a fine, but parents would be fined $100 for the second
curfew violation and $300 for all subsequent violations.
   The exceptions in the amended bill include minors accompanied by
a parent; returning home from an activity sponsored by a church,
school or non-profit organization; traveling in a motor vehicle;
employed during curfew hours; or on an emergency errand.
   Only one federal court has upheld a curfew bill, in Middletown,
Pa., in 1975, according to Spitzer. Since then, federal courts have
struck down curfew laws three times.

   Two top NASA officials say they've decided to
retire before new federal retirement regulations take effect.
   Noel W. Hinners, the third-ranking executive in the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, said he will retire on May
14, the day before new post-retirement regulations for government
employees become effective.
   James B. Odom, 55, chief of NASA's space station program, said
he is retiring next Sunday and blamed the sudden decision on ``the
impact of some upcoming changes on government retirees.''
   Also announcing retirement plans was astronaut Jon A. McBride,
45, who was scheduled to command a space shuttle flight next March.
He said he will retire from NASA on May 12 and will retire from the
Navy in ``the near future.''
   Hinners blamed his decision to retire on what he called
``uncertainty in interpretation of new post-employment laws.''
   A geologist and geochemist, Hinners served as chief scientist
for NASA and joined the NASA senior management team in Washington
in 1987.
   Odom, a 33-year veteran of NASA, has headed the space station
program for a year. The agency is in the midst of a major push to
persuade Congress to budget funds for starting construction on the
station.

   Some of the nation's top law enforcement
officials worked in the dark for a while because construction crews
couldn't connect an emergency generator supplying power to part of
the Justice Department.
   Electrical power to the southwest portion of the Justice
Department building was knocked out last week when a power cable
was severed by construction crews installing anti-terrorist
security barriers on the west side of the building, said
spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade.
   Power was restored about 6 p.m. Monday but the outage
inconvenienced many top officials for most of the business day.
   A large generator inside a tractor-trailer was plugged into the
building to provide power. But crews had trouble reconnecting the
generator Monday, leaving the office of Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and some of his top deputies without power, she said.
   ``We are fortunate this occurred on a day the A.G. is in sunny
California,'' said David Runkel, an aide to Thornburgh, who was
meeting with Drug Enforcement Administration officials in Los
Angeles.

   The Army has grounded its entire fleet of
Vietnam era UH-1 Huey transport helicopters for a safety inspection
of main rotor bolts.
   The service said the grounding order was issued late Friday and
was keeping about 3,100 choppers on the ground.
   Lt. Col. John Reitz, an Army spokesman, said the grounding order
was prompted by an incident last week in which a Huey was being
moved manually across a tarmac and two of the bolts in the ``main
rotor pillow block'' suddenly snapped.
   He said that further inspection showed cracks and stress
corrosion in the bolts.
   ``In this case, there was no accident and no loss of life,''
Reitz said. ``But you would have a big problem if this happened in
flight. So a grounding order was issued immediately to ensure
safety.''
   The bolts at issue sit atop the main rotor hub and help hold the
main rotor blades to the shaft.

<TEXT>
   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma
has accused the United States of secretly giving $10 million to
opponents of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as part of a plan to
retain control of the Panama Canal.
   Solis Palma said Monday that ``Panamanian traitors'' were
conspiring to renege on the 1977 treaties under which control of
the vital waterway is to be ceded to Panama in the year 2000.
   Noriega, head of the Defense Forces and Panama's de facto ruler,
accused the United States of playing a ``dirty game.'' He told a
news conference that ``the men who speak of democracy have dirtied
their hands.
   ``The Panamanian people _ and it is important that the United
States know this and that President Bush not be deceived _ are
supremely angered.''
   The United States has been at odds with Noriega, once a strong
ally, since last year, when a U.S. grand jury indicted him on
charges of drug trafficking and money laundering.
   U.S. News and World Report said in its May 1 issue that
President Bush has signed a secret intelligence directive to give
$10 million to the Panamanian opposition. It says the money was to
be used for printing, advertising, transportation and
communications for opposition candidates in May 7 elections.
   White House officials have refused to comment on the report,
saying it involves covert operations.
   Attorney Guillermo Endara, who is running against Noriega-backed
presidential candidate Carlos Duque, on Monday denied receiving any
campaign funds from the United States.
   ``We haven't asked for or received, nor are we going to receive,
cent from foreigners nor from the United States nor from any other
power,'' Endara said in a television appearance. ``All the money we
have used in this campaign has been Panamanian money and we would
not accept any foreign money.''
   The opposition has accused Noriega of planning to rig the May 7
vote, in which Panamanians will choose a new president, two vice
presidents, 67 legislators and 510 local representatives.
   Endara has called the election a plebiscite on Noriega's de
facto rule.
   Solis Palma contended Monday that the United States would resort
to military intervention if its attempts to ``destabilize'' Panama
failed.
   Last year, the Reagan administration set in motion a plan to
oust Noriega. The New York Times reported Monday that if that
approached failed, the administration wanted to organize a coup.
   The Senate Intelligence Committee rejected the coup plan,
however, on grounds that Noriega might be assassinated, the Times
reported. A presidential order forbids U.S. participation in
assassinations.
   Last spring, the United States imposed economic sanctions
against Panama in an attempt to force out Noriega.
   Bush this month extended the sanctions, which include sharp
restrictions on U.S. companies that do business in Panama, a hold
on assets of the Panamanian government in the United States and a
prohibition on tax payments by U.S. organizations to Panama.

   Police Chief Maurice T. Turner is retiring
amid growing notoriety of the District of Columbia as a drug and
murder capital as well as continuing conflict with Mayor Marion S.
Barry, published reports say.
   Turner, a 32-year veteran of the force whom Barry had appointed
chief in 1981, submitted his retirement papers and will step down
July 31, The Washington Post and The Washington Times reported in
today's editions.
   ``I've been thinking about it a while,'' Turner told the Times.
``I guess you've got to go when the environment is right.''
   Turner declined to comment on reports that he may take a
position with the office of national drug policy director William
J. Bennett, the Times said. The Post reported that Asstistant Chief
Isaac Fulwood, the department's second-ranking official, will be
named to succeed Turner in running the 3,990-member force.
   The Times said Turner did not rule out the possibility he might
run for mayor. ``Well, I'm still playing it by ear,'' he said.
``Some people are asking me (to run for mayor), but I just don't
want to say publicly right now.''
   Turner had been increasingly at odds with Barry over the past
few months, according to the reports.
   The Times quoted a source close to Turner as saying the chief
feared his years of service would be tarnished by controversy
surrounding Barry.
   One source of friction was Barry's attempt to call police
officials to learn the results of an internal department inquiry
into the handling of Barry's visit to a friend at a downtown hotel
room, the Post said. The friend, Charles Lewis, has since been
indicted on drug charges.
   A police investigation of a drug complaint at the hotel room
last December was abruptly halted when police learned that Barry
was in the room, according to reports.
   The two also feuded over increasing the size of the force, a
move that Barry opposed, the Post said.
   In a statement issued by his office Monday night, Barry praised
Turner for his ``illustrious and distinguished career'' and said he
is ``respected both locally and nationally.''

   Afghanistan's foreign minister has told
the Security Council that his government will retaliate against
Pakistan unless that country stops supporting the guerrillas trying
to overthrow the Kabul regime.
   ``If the Security Council fails to adopt necessary measures for
defusing the present tense situation, and if Pakistani aggression
and intervention against our contry is continued, we will have no
choice but the firm and patriotic defense of our country,'' the
envoy, Abdul Wakil, said Monday.
   In a 90-minute speech, the foreign minister said Pakistan was as
vulnerable to rocket attacks as Afghanistan, which has been
bombarded by rockets transported across the Afghan-Pakistan border.
   He also charged that the guerrilla assault on the Afghan city of
Jalalabad was being organized, armed and financed by Pakistan with
help from the CIA.
   Pakistan, the United States, Saudi Arabia and China are among
major supporters and arms suppliers of the insurgents, who began
fighting after a communist coup in April 1978.
   Pakistan also serves as headquarters for seven guerrilla groups.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to back the
government and completed their withdrawal Feb. 15 under
U.N.-mediated accords. Moscow continues to supply the Afghan army.
   In the U.N. accords, Afghanistan and Pakistan pledged not to
intervene in each other's affairs. The Kabul government and the
Soviet Union insist that Pakistan is violating the agreement and
want the United Nations to take measures to end the alleged
violations.
   The guerrillas laid siege to Jalalabad on March 6 in their first
major offensive following the Soviet troop withdrawal. Capturing it
would give them a base for the exile government they formed in
Pakistan two months ago and help them gain momentum for an attack
on Kabul, the capital, 75 miles to the east.
   Jalalabad is about 45 miles west of the Pakistan frontier.
   Guerrilla leaders initially predicted Jalalabad would fall
within days, but the Afghan army is equipped with sophisticated
Soviet weapons and has repulsed the insurgents' rocket and
artillery attacks.
   Diplomats in Kabul say both sides have suffered heavy casualties.
   Debate on Afghanistan was to resume at the U.N. today.
   The 15-member Security Council was not expected to take a stand
on the case, however, because the United States _ one of the
council's five permanent members _ is certain to veto any
resolution critical of Pakistan and Washington.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities have bounced back after a sharp drop last week.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills
in Monday's auction at an average discount rate of 8.66 percent, up
from 8.57 percent last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.72 percent, up
from 8.59 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since April 10, when three-month
bills sold for 8.71 percent and six-month bills averaged 8.78
percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.98 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,781.10 and 9.25 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,559.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 9.28
percent last week, down from 9.48 percent the previous week.

   When Noboru Takeshita took office as prime
minister, skeptics doubted that the man known for his cautious,
back-room political style would be able to create a commanding role
for Japan on the international stage.
   Ironically, he proved successful at his diplomatic efforts, but
it was his main strength _ fund-raising for the governing Liberal
Democratic Party _ that brought him down after only 18 months on
the job.
   In announcing today that he intended to resign as Japan's 46th
prime minister, Takeshita took responsibility for a scandal that
made the country's Japan's least popular prime minister since World
War II, according to polls.
   Takeshita, 65, took over as prime minister from the charismatic
Yasuhiro Nakasone in November 1987.
   Within two months of taking office he had visited the United
States and established a first-name relationship with former
President Reagan. He traveled frequently to other countries.
   Under Takeshita's leadership, Japan surpassed the United States
as the world's biggest foreign aid donor to developing countries.
It also earned new respect as a contributor to diplomatic efforts.
   Takeshita also played busy host to dignitaries from 164 nations
in February at the state funeral for Emperor Hirohito, an
unprecedented gathering of world leaders.
   But his popularity sagged among the Japanese with increasing
revelations that he and members of his Cabinet had accepted
bargain-priced stocks and other donations from the Recruit Co., an
information conglomerate that allegedly attempted to buy government
influence.
   Takeshita acknowledged receiving more than $1 million from
Recruit. He also confirmed that he borrowed about $381,700 from the
company in 1987 and repaid the money a few months later.
   Recruit was a major donor to Takeshita's fund-raising parties.
Party tickets are an important tool in raising the money needed to
gain and maintain office in Japan.
   Takeshita was partly motivated to resign out of fear his term
would be remembered for nothing but the Recruit scandal, said
Yotaro Konaka, a political analyst.
   Konaka said the prime minister did not want to see the Liberal
Democratic Party lose its 35-year hold on the nation's parliament
in summer elections, or watch his newly implemented _ and highly
unpopular _ tax reform program be canceled.
   ``Other than the emperor's funeral, he must have realized that
the tax reform was his only domestic achievement,'' Konaka said.
``If the tax reform is erased, it will make him a prime minister
with no achievement whatsoever.''
   The eldest son of a rice-wine brewing family, Takeshita was born
Feb. 26, 1924, in a village in western Japan. After serving as a
pilot trainee at the end of World War II, he completed his
university studies, taught English and social studies for several
years, and then turned to politics.
   He was elected to his local state assembly at 27, and then won a
seat in the powerful lower house of the Parliament in 1958 at age
34.
   His political skills gained him key posts. He became finance
minister in 1979 under Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira and continued
to hold that high post under Nakasone's administration.

   The dollar finished lower against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, but share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained
markedly following Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's announcement
that he will resign.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 223.89-point loser on
Monday, regained 438.86 points, or 1.34 percent, to finish at
33,244.78 points. The gain was the third-largest for one day this
year.
   The dollar closed at 131.17 yen, down 0.21 yen from Monday's
131.38-yen finish. The currency started higher at 131.65 yen and
gradually fell while ranging between 131.05-131.65 yen.
   The yen rose as participants began buying the currency after the
news about Takeshita's resignation as well as the possibility of an
interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan, traders said.
   Market players expect Takeshita's resignation, coming after much
uncertainty, to stabilize the yen, said a trader with a commercial
bank in Tokyo.
   Takeshita announced his decision to resign following a Cabinet
meeting late Tuesday morning.
   Also encouraging yen-buying were expectations that the Japanese
central bank might raise its interest rate soon.
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita at the bank's branch chief
meeting Tuesday said the bank would swiftly take appropriate
measures if instability of prices occurs.
   On the stock exchange, dealers attributed the sharp gain in the
market's main index to Takeshita's decision to resign.
   ``Investors have already expected the resignation to come sooner
or later, and were reassured by the news'' because they believed
the resignation would remedy current political instability, said a
dealer with Nomura Securities, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   A powerful earthquake struck a remote mountain
area of southwestern China today for the second time in nine days.
There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.
   The official Xinhua news Agency said the quake measured 6.7 on
the Richter scale and struck at 11:13 a.m. near Batang County, an
isolated region along Sichuan province's border with Tibet.
   A tremor measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale rocked the same area
on April 16, killing four people and injuring five. Seven more
people were reported killed and 700 houses destroyed in aftershocks
over the next few days.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake measuring 6 or higher can cause severe damage
in a populated area.

   Two Palestinians who are
American citizens have become entangled in Israel's military
justice system and one disappeared after answering a summons to an
army headuarters.
   Relatives of Jafer Hamayel, 25, said he complied with the army
summons on April 13 and they have since been unable to locate him.
   The other American, 16-year-old Mansour Abdallah, was accused of
throwing stones and has been held for three months without bail and
without appearing in court, his lawyer said.
   Human rights activists say Hamayel and Abdallah are among
thousands of Palestinians who are being denied basic legal rights
under military justice in effect in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Army officials deny the allegations, saying the military has set
up a special office to help lawyers find clients and that bail has
been granted in hundreds of cases.
   ``We believe we have a liberal judicial system in the
territories, but we should not be judged in the same context as
Western countries that are not in a state of war,'' an army
official said earlier this year.
   In the cases of Hamayel and Abdallah, both of whom had lived in
Puerto Rico, the army was unable to locate either one even after
being given details three days earlier by The Associated Press.
   An army official, who could not be identified under military
regulations, said he could not locate them because he did not have
Israeli-issued identification numbers for them.
   Palestinian lawyer Jonathan Kuttab said Abdallah has only a U.S.
passport and not an Israeli identity card. Hamayel's relatives said
he had his Israeli card with him when he disappeared and they did
not know the number.
   Hamayel was born in Kufr Malik, a mountain village known for its
resistance to Israeli occupation.
   On a visit Monday to the village 15 miles north of Jerusalem,
Palestine Liberation Organization slogans, Palestinian flags and a
poster of PLO chief Yasser Arafat adorned the main square.
   Hamayel left Kufr Malik in 1983 after being imprisoned for three
months on charges of violating Israeli law by raising Palestinian
flags, said his uncle, Ata Hamayel, 39.
   He said Jafer Hamayel then lived for six years in San Juan,
Puerto Rico, joining his parents who went to the Caribbean island
in 1966 and now own a clothing store.
   The uncle said the young man had studied accounting at Puerto
Rico's InterAmerican University.
   Ata Hamayel gave this account of his nephew's disappearance:
   Several months ago Jafer Hamayel became a U.S. citizen. On April
4, he returned to Kufr Malik to renew his Israeli-issued identity
card. Without the card he would lose the right to live in the West
Bank.
   Shortly after his arrival he was given a summons to appear at
the military headquarters in Ramallah and went there April 13.
   Later that day, a Ramallah man saw Jafer Hamayel being held in a
tent jail at the headquarters but the family has not seen him since
and has not been notified by the army of his fate.
   Ata Hamayel said U.S. consular officials were refused permission
to see his nephew at the Ramallah headquarters.
   U.S. Consulate spokesman David Good said efforts were made to
find Jafer Hamayel but ``we haven't been able to make contact with
him yet.'' Good refused to discuss details of the case.
   Ahmed Sayyad, Abdallah's lawyer, said the youth was arrested
Jan. 23 in his native West Bank village of Surda on charges of
throwing stones and setting up road barricades.
   Sayyad said military officials failed to present Abdallah at
court hearings March 19 and March 30 and have not responded to a
request that the youth be released on bail.
   The lawyer said another court hearing is scheduled for Sunday.
   Good said consular officials visited Abdallah on March 24 and
are trying to get him released on bail. He said Abdallah and
Hamayel are the only two Palestinian-Americans being held under
military detention.
   Good said he did know how many American citizens have been
arrested since the Palestinian uprising began in December 1987 in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip but added: ``We never had more than
three or four at a time.''
   About 7,000 Palestinians with U.S. passports live in the West
Bank and Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem, according to Good. He
said only a few live in the Gaza Strip.
   Army officials say at least 20,000 Palestinians have been
arrested during the uprising, which has claimed the lives of 444
Palestinians and 18 Israelis.
   Army figures showed 6,650 Palestinians were being detained as of
early April with 3,627 awaiting trial, 1,187 held under emergency
laws that require no charges or trial, 974 awaiting sentencing and
862 serving sentences.

<HEAD>Daley Takes Office As Mayor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard M. Daley put a hand on an old family
bible, looked into the eyes of an old family friend and took the
oath of mayor, a job his late father held for 21 years.
   But in Orchestra Hall, surrounded by many state and local
officials whose careers started with the blessing of Chicago boss
Richard J. Daley, the new mayor said his administration would not
resemble his father's vaunted army of loyal foot soldiers.
   ``Business as usual is a prescription for failure,'' he said
Monday after he took the oath on his 47th birthday, noting that his
father instilled him with values, but policies will be his own.
   ``The old ways of doing business simply aren't adequate to cope
with the new challenges we face,'' Daley said.
   Daley said City Hall will be open to all _ a pledge that
produced optimism among his black election opponents and their
supporters. Chicago is the largest U.S. city to replace a black
mayor with a white.
   ``He appears to be using a reconciling approach as opposed to a
polarizing approach, and that is good,'' said Jesse Jackson, who
supported two blacks and had warned during the campaign that
Chicago would return to the machine politics that marked the elder
Daley's reign.
   Daley was sworn in by U.S. District Judge Abraham Lincoln
Marovitz, a family friend who presided at the elder Daley's six
inaugurations.
   ``This is a sentimental journey for me,'' said the 83-year-old
judge.
   The new mayor delivered an upbeat speech, mentioning few
specific goals but acknowledging that the city's school system,
labeled the worst in the nation by President Reagan's Education
Secretary William Bennett, needs an overhaul.
   ``Today our foundation is crumbling and nothing but genuine
school reform will repair it,'' Daley said.
   The former Cook County prosecutor was elected April 4 to
complete the last two years of the second term of the late Harold
Washington, Chicago's first black mayor. Daley succeeds Eugene
Sawyer, who had been acting mayor since Washington's death 17
months ago.
   Daley defeated Sawyer, who is black, in the Democratic primary
Feb. 28 and then defeated black Alderman Timothy Evans and
Republican Edward Vrdolyak in the general election.
   Washington's first election in 1983 led to a few years of bitter
debate in City Council, with a white majority blocking his
programs. Evans predicted that black aldermen would not act as
obstructionists during Daley's term.
   ``Wherever he (Daley) is correct, we're going to move right
along with him,'' Evans said, but if aldermen disagree with the
mayor they will ``protect the gains of this community.''

   A chunk of ice the size of a volleyball
crashed through the roof of a house during a thunderstorm and a
meteorologist said it may have come from an airplane.
   ``You can safely say it was related to the thunderstorm, but I
don't think it fell out of the sky by itself,'' said Ted Buehner,
meteorologist for the National Weather Service office at Portland
International Airport. ``It had to have some kind of assistance.''
   Most likely the ice accumulated on the wing of a plane and then
fell off, Buehner said. But he checked with the control tower and
was told there had been no reports of abnormal ice buildup.
   The ice smashed through the roof into a bedroom of a house owned
by Duane and Joan Cline as Cline was reading the newspaper in his
living room Monday night.
   Cline said when he first heard the noise, he thought a car had
crashed into his house, as one did a few years ago.
   But then he looked into the spare bedroom and saw a foot-long
hole in the ceiling with plaster, wood and roof material scattered
with ice on the floor. The ice apparently had broken into about 20
pieces, with the largest about the size of a softball, he said.
   Cline said he planned to store the ice in his freezer and may
have it tested.

   A wine merchant showing off a bottle of wine
once owned by Thomas Jefferson accidentally hit a serving tray,
breaking the bottle and spilling the vintage contents.
   Bill Sokolin was showing the bottle of 1787 Chateau Margaux to
300 wine lovers at a tasting Sunday at The Four Seasons restaurant
when he hit a tray and felt a liquid running down his leg.
   ``I thought someone had spilled coffee,'' Sokolin told the New
York Post. Then he noticed two holes in the bottle and saw that 80
percent of the wine was gone.
   Sokolin obtained the bottle in October on consignment for an
owner whose identity he would not disclose. He said he had had
three offers for the bottle, including one for $300,000.
   Sokolin was asking $519,000 for the bottle.
   He initially left the bottle at home, but returned home to fetch
it after arriving at the tasting and seeing the crowd of
oenophiles. Sokolin said the bottle was insured.
   What remained of the bottle's contents gave Sokolin small
consolation.
   ``It tasted like it still had wine taste, but not very good,''
he said.

<HEAD>Founder Of Parks Sausages Dead At 72</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Henry G. Parks Jr., who founded Parks Sausage
Co., the first black-owned business to raise money with a public
sale of stock, has died after a long illness. He was 72.
   Parks, who began to suffer from Parkinson's Disease in the
mid-1970s, died early Monday at the Meridian Multi-Medical Nursing
Center in Towson, hospital officials said.
   Baltimore-based Parks Sausage makes scrapple, sausage and other
meat products for sale in stores from Massachusetts to Virginia.
The company's slogan, ``More Parks Sausages, Mom,'' is well known
throughout the Northeast.
   Parks founded the company in 1951 in an abandoned dairy in
Baltimore. He took it public in 1969.
   ``That's so significant,'' said Raymond V. Haysbert, the current
chairman of Parks Sausage. ``Public financing of companies is what
America is all about. Underlining that achievement is that only
three or four other black firms have followed Parks into public
financing since 1969.''
   Parks Sausage was one of the largest black-owned companies in
the nation when Parks sold his interest in it in 1977 for $1.58
million.
   Parks also served on the Baltimore City Council from 1963
through 1969 and pushed bills opening public accommodations to
blacks and easing bail requirements for people accused of crimes.
   ``He was not a civil rights person in the confrontational
sense,'' Haysbert said. ``But he worked behind the scenes to
convince powerful people of the illogic of racism.''
   ``I think that I proved that black businessmen not only can be
successful, but that they can be successful on the same terms as
anybody else,'' Parks once said.
   Parks was born in Atlanta and grew up in Dayton, Ohio. He said
he became interested in business while studying at Ohio State
University. At the university, he roomed with Olympic sprinter
Jesse Owens, became the first black on the school's swim team and
was the only black in his marketing classes.
   Parks also sat on the corporate boards of Magnavox, First Penn
Corp., Warner Lambert Co., W.R. Grace Co., and others.
   Survivors include two daughters, a sister and three
grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   A pudgy super-hacker who agreed to plead
guilty and spend a year in prison for computer fraud must stand
trial after all because a judge thinks the proposed sentence isn't
harsh enough.
   U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer surprised Kevin David
Mitnick, his defense attorney and a prosecutor by rejecting their
plea agreement on Monday and ordering Mitnick to trial.
   ``You have been engaged in this activity for far too long and no
one has adequately punished you,'' the judge told the defendant,
citing two previous convictions for computer fraud in 1981 and 1987.
   ``This is the last time you are going to do this.''
   The judge suggested the 25-year-old Mitnick remains a danger and
rejected a prosecutor's belated claim that Mitnick didn't destroy
anything of value.
   Mitnick, clad in a blue prison uniform, appeared stunned by the
rejection. Outside court, defense lawyer Alan Rubin expressed
disappointment and said the judge's action took him by surprise.
   ``She obviously considers him a far greater menace than I do or
the government does,'' he said. Rubin said it was unlikely Mitnick
would agree to any new bargain involving a longer sentence.
   When the case began last December, prosecutors portrayed Mitnick
as a brilliant youth obsessed with junk food and computers who used
the code name ``Condor'' to infiltrate computer systems in the
United States and England.
   They suggested he might have gained access to top secret
National Security Agency computers, but such charges were never
brought. Last month, they agreed to a plea bargain.
   Under his plea, Mitnick had admitted he infiltrated Digital
Equipment Corp.'s computer system and stole one of its programs. He
also admitted stealing 16 MCI telephone codes and using them to
make long-distance calls for free.
   The prosecution had agreed to dismiss two additional charges,
one of which alleged Mitnick infiltrated the computer system of
Leeds University in England. If Mitnick stands trial, those charges
would be reinstated.
   Assistant U.S. attorney James Sanders told the judge he had
``thought long and hard'' before entering the agreement and
concluded that Mitnick's actions weren't seriously destructive.
   ``This is not a case where Mr. Mitnick destroyed anyone's
computer or inserted viruses in a computer,'' he told the judge.
   He also noted that the government would have to grant immunity
to an alleged co-conspirator, Leonard DiCicco, to obtain his
testimony against Mitnick.
   But Pfaelzer was unmoved.
   ``I don't think a year is long enough. And I'm not going to
honor the agreement,'' she said. A pretrial report recommended a
higher sentence, she noted.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International, which opposes capital
punishment in all circumstances, said today that the use of the
death penalty in the United States appears arbitrary and biased
against blacks and Hispanics.
   In a 268-page worldwide report titled ``When the State Kills,''
the human rights group condemned the use of the death penalty as a
``judicial lottery'' that does not deter crime.
   The United States and 99 other countries execute people for
crimes.
   ``Despite a range of safeguards, the use of the death penalty in
the USA appears to be arbitrary and racially biased,'' Amnesty
International said in the report's introduction.
   The London-based group, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977,
criticized America for executing convicts for crimes committed when
they were juveniles.
   In June 1988, 30 prisoners in 14 states were under sentence of
death for crimes committed when they were under age 18. This is
permitted by 25 states, the report said.
   As of May 1988, 2,048 prisoners were under the death sentence in
35 states, according to the report. Ninety-eight prisoners were
executed from 1977 to May 31, 1988, including three juveniles, two
in Texas and one in South Carolina.
   The report mentioned the case of James Terry Roach. He pleaded
guilty in 1977 when he was 17 to two murders, sexual assault,
kidnapping and other charges, and was executed in South Carolina on
Jan. 10, 1986.
   Amnesty said there are regional disparities in the numbers of
death sentences. Four states _ Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and
Texas _ have accounted for more than three-quarters of all
executions since 1977, the report said.
   ``Jury selection procedures in most states allow prosecutors to
exclude committed opponents of the death penalty from sitting as
jurors. ... Studies have indicated that this practice has created
`death-prone' juries,'' according to the report.
   It said black defendants, especially in Southern states, have
often been convicted by all-white juries after prosecutors have
excluded black prospective jurors.
   Blacks comprise 12 percent of the national population but 41
percent of prisoners under sentence of death, the report said.
   ``The evidence suggests that race _ especially that of the
victim _ has an important bearing on the likelihood of a death
sentence being imposed, especially in the Southern states. Although
blacks and whites are the victims of homicide in almost equal
numbers, most offenders who are sentenced to death are convicted of
murdering whites.''
   This was the case in 86 percent of trials in 1987, it said.
Between January 1977 and May 1988, according to Amnesty's report,
45 of the 98 people executed were black or Hispanic and 84 were
convicted of killing white victims, the report said.
   It cited the cases of Willie Jasper Darden in Florida and Edward
Earl Johnson in Mississippi as two since 1985 in which evidence
emerged after the executions that strongly suggested innocence.
   Amnesty International also finds deficiencies in legal aid
available to capital defendants. The lawyers often are
``inexperienced, ill-equipped to handle such cases and severely
limited in their resources,'' it said.
   Most states do not provide legal representation for capital
defendants after appeal to state supreme courts, so ``in order to
file further appeals on constitutional grounds, they must rely on
volunteer lawyers working without payment,'' the report said.
   Many prisoners awaiting execution may be mentally ill or
mentally handicapped, it argued, and said at least six such
prisoners have been executed since 1984.
   The report cites a 1987 study saying 349 people convicted of
capital offenses between 1900 and 1985 turned out to be innocent
and 23 of those people were executed.

   Much of the nation enjoyed fair skies today, but an unusual span
of foul weather brought more rain to Northern California and
thunderstorms produced hail and damaging winds in the Plains.
   The eccentric weather pattern over Northern California created a
series of mini-floods, traffic tie-ups and accidents, and clogged
drains in San Francisco.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms produced golf ball-size hail in
northeastern Colorado, and wind gusts up to 59 mph in northeastern
Nebraska.
   Thunderstorms also produced dime size-hail and downed trees in
parts of southeastern Minnesota and southern Wisconsin. Wind gusted
to 70 mph in northwestern Oklahoma and produced severe weather in
south-central Kansas. Hail accompanied a late evening thunderstorm
in north-central South Dakota.
   Showers dampened eastern South Carolina and southwestern Oregon
early today.
   Today's forecast called for widely scattered thunderstorms over
the Great Plains; scattered showers and thunderstorms from the
upper Mississippi Valley across the Great Lakes and central
Appalachians to parts of North Carolina; showers and a few
thunderstorms over the West Coast and the northern Rockies; snow
over northern Nevada, western Montana and northern Maine.
   Highs were expected to be in the 40s over northern Nevada and
parts of Montana and northern Maine; in the 50s and 60s on the West
Coast, the northern Rockies, the Dakotas and the Great Lakes to the
north Atlantic Coast; in the 90s over parts of the central and
southern Plains and the middle Mississippi Valley; and in the 70s
and 80s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 26
degrees at Concord and Lebanon, N.H., to 78 degrees at Fort Riley,
Kan.

   A plan to make the city's government
constitutional by expanding the City Council and setting up a new
commission drew good reviews from the mayor but was panned by
presidents of the five boroughs.
   Frederick A.O. Schwarz, chairman of the Charter Revision
Commission, outlined proposals Monday that would give the mayor
more direct control over awarding contracts, previously the domain
of the powerful Board of Estimate. The mayor would be required to
submit his plans to communities for review, though.
   The proposals also would increase the City Council to 50 members
from 35 and create a new commission to oversee city-owned land,
rule on zoning changes and award city franchises, also currently
the board's province.
   The mayor would appoint four of the 11 commission members.
   The plan comes one month after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that
the Board of Estimate was unconstitutional because it violated the
one-person, one-vote doctrine. Schwarz said he hoped his plan would
provide fair representation for all New Yorkers.
   Staten Island, the city's smallest borough with about 400,000
residents, has the same presence on the board as the other four
boroughs, including Brooklyn with 2.2 million residents.
   Staten Island Borough President Ralph Lamberti said the
proposals ``are a disaster for Staten Island and all local
communities. It makes the authority of the mayor almost czar-like.''
   Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden said Schwarz ``is
telling the boroughs to drop dead.''
   But Schwarz said the plan would give borough leaders more say
over land use, budget formulation and budget oversight.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch and City Comptroller Harrison Goldin were
generally pleased by the proposals.
   ``The principles that the chairman lays out in his report would
seem to be quite positive,'' said mayoral spokesman Clifford Chanin.
   Under the plan, the comptroller no longer would be involved in
policy and would be limited to fiscal matters and oversight and
audit functions on contracts.
   ``The comptroller's role has always been overwhelmingly
fiscal,'' Goldin said. ``This recognizes that reality.''
   The Charter Revision Commission, which was created by the mayor,
has set a goal of getting a proposal for governmental change on the
November ballot.
   The chairman's proposals are the first formal agenda on which
the 15-member commission can debate. They aren't final.

   A confessed North Korean agent wept
today as a court sentenced her to death for the 1987 bombing of a
South Korean airliner in which 115 people were killed.
   Officials said they expect 27-year-old Kim Hyon Hui to be
pardoned.
   Ms. Kim shook with grief as Judge Chung Sang-hwak pronounced her
guilty of violating national security and aviation laws and
sentenced her to die by hanging. She said nothing before being
whisked away by security agents.
   Relatives of the victims sat quietly as Chung said there was no
doubt that Ms. Kim was guilty of planting a bomb aboard a Korea Air
Boeing 707 that disappeared on Nov. 29, 1987 over the Andaman Sea
as it approached the Burmese coast. The plane was en route to Seoul
from Baghdad, Iraq.
   Ms. Kim confessed on South Korean television in January 1988
that she planted the bomb as part of a plot by senior leaders of
communist North Korea to disrupt the Olympic Games, held
successfully in Seoul last summer.
   She said at a hearing on April 4 that she wanted to die to atone
for the deaths.
   She has a week to appeal the sentence, but defense lawyers said
no decision had been made on the matter.
   South Korean officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Ms. Kim was expected to be pardoned on grounds she was duped by
communist North Korea and has repented.
   North Korea has denied it had anything to do with the plane
bombing and has claimed it was engineered by South Korea to
embarrass the north.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of the
peninsula at the end of World War II.
   Judge Chung, who headed the three-judge panel hearing the case,
said the destruction of the plane underlined the threat the north
poses to South Korea's freedom and survival.
   ``We have an enemy which always tries to our destroy liberal
democratic system. We must face that reality with resolute
determination,'' he said in a 13-minute statement.
   The sentencing came after three hearings during which Ms. Kim
often sobbed into a hankerchief as she listened to testimony that
the plane exploded in less than a second, killing all aboard
instantly. The bodies were never recovered.
   Ms. Kim arrived at the courthouse today under heavy security and
hundreds of police surrounded the building to prevent protests by
angry relatives or a possible threat from North Korean agents.
   Relatives of the victims disrupted the earlier proceedings and
often yelled ``Kill her!''
   They were silent today as Chung read the verdict and gathered in
small groups outside afterward. Some relatives expressed
satisfaction with the death sentence, but others urged mercy.
   Ms. Kim said she and another intelligence agent pretending to be
Japanese tourists planted the bomb disguised as a radio and a
liquor bottle when they flew from Baghdad to Abu Dhabi, where they
got off.
   The pair were arrested a short time later in Bahrain and
attempted to take cyanide hidden in cigarettes. The other agent, an
elderly man, died, but Kim recovered and was extradited to Seoul.

   A bookmaker said he took as much as $1 million
in sports bets from baseball great Pete Rose, prosecutors say.
   A transcript of a pre-sentencing meeting at Cincinnati last
Friday in the case of the bookmaker, former Ohio restaurant owner
Ronald Peters, contained the $1 million allegation and a letter
from baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti.
   The transcript, which was released Monday, does not indicate
that Rose bet on baseball. The Cincinnati Reds manager would face a
year's expulsion from baseball if he had bet on baseball games and
a lifetime ban if he had bet on his team.
   Giamatti's said in his letter to U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin
that he believes the bookmaker's testimony was truthful.
   Rose, baseball's all-time leader in hits, has declined to
comment on Peters' statement or the commissioner's letter. But the
judge was angry with Giamatti.
   ``There is evidence here, in my opinion, of a vendetta against
Pete Rose,'' Rubin said.
   Peters is to be sentenced by Rubin on charges of cocaine
distribution and tax evasion.

   Investigators were searching today for
the cause of an explosion underneath Ford Motor Co.'s massive Rouge
complex that killed two maintenance workers, tore holes in parking
lots and flipped cars.
   Ford spokesman John Spelich said the bodies of John L. Hatch, in
his early 50s, and Billy Stiener, 27, were found Monday evening in
an underground tunnel. Spelich did not know how or when they died.
   The explosion Monday morning shook the underpinnings of the
1,100-acre complex just west of Detroit and knocked out power to
factories, including the plant that makes Mustang automobiles.
   Spelich said the complex would operate normally today, except
for one glass-making building.
   Divers searched for the men after the tunnel was flooded with 4
to 6 feet of water. The blast apparently ruptured a water pipe,
Spelich said.
   Spelich said the victims were employed by Doetsch Industrial
Services Inc. of Detroit.
   John Schultz, a bus driver at the complex, said soon after the
explosion he saw flames shooting 300 to 500 feet into the air for a
short period. No fire damage was found, however.
   On the ground, concern that asbestos from steam pipe wrappings
might escape into the air caused workers to wear masks and
protective clothing.
   About 6,500 first-shift employees were sent home after the
explosion. Monday afternoon shifts were canceled.

   A church that raised $175,000 over two
decades toward building a new place of worship used the money
instead to buy several abandoned neighborhood homes formerly taken
over by crack dealers.
   The homes bought by the Third Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church
will be renovated and rented to low-income people, said Benjamin
Edwards Sr., the church's board chairman.
   Church members ``all jumped at the idea. The vote was
unanimous,'' Edwards said Monday. The church bought seven houses
this month.
   He said the decision was easy. The church has been broken into
repeatedly; thieves even took the air conditioner. And churchgoers
were particularly upset when drugs were sold a few feet from the
church during services.
   The church already has a waiting list for renters. ``The word
spread like wildfire,'' Edwards said.

   George Bush's first major domestic trip
as president is off to a rocky start and there are more pitfalls on
the horizon of his hectic four-day journey across America.
   The president's travels through Virginia, Illinois, North
Dakota, California, Texas and Florida could end up as a melange of
frenzied motion, mixed messages and missed opportunities. Even his
aides expressed private concern over some of the scheduling.
   For example, in Norfolk, Va., Bush walked among the audience at
a memorial service Monday, trying to console relatives of the 47
sailors killed on the battleship Iowa. Oddly, he seemed to snub
almost half the relatives, ignoring the final three rows of
grief-stricken families.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater explained later
that a military escort had steered Bush away after he completed the
first four rows, incorrectly telling him he had met with all the
immediate relatives.
   Fitzwater said Bush thought it was ``really a tragedy'' that
some relatives had been ignored.
   If Bush's journey embodies a particular theme, it's not obvious.
   Monday, his main focus was a review of his first 100 days in
office. Today, Bush delivers a speech in Palo Alto focusing on
industrial competitiveness, deficit reduction, capital-gains tax
cuts and other subjects.
   Then he jumps on Air Force One, flies to a military depot in Los
Angeles and hops a helicopter. His destination is a 213-acre ranch
seized by the government from an alleged marijuana kingpin. He
spends the evening in Los Angeles at a Hispanic salute to the
president.
   Bush's trip underscores that he has adopted a different media
strategy than Ronald Reagan, who tried to shape news accounts by
focusing on a single message each day and reinforcing it with
colorful backdrops.
   Bush is all over the lot in terms of subjects and his staging is
nothing spectacular.
   Privately, some members of the White House staff are embarrassed
by Bush's scheduling. It is rife with the kind of miscues that even
a novice political candidate would avoid.
   It reinforces criticism that Bush has not been able to spell out
in his first 100 days what he wants to do, the vision he has for
his presidency.
   From the start of the trip, things went awry at the Norfolk
memorial service.
   Despite the somber nature of the occasion, Bush flashed a bright
smile at the end of his speech and held a fixed grin on his face as
he met one-by-one with the victims' relatives. His reaction was a
nervous one; clearly he had been moved by the ceremony. He was seen
with tears on his cheeks as he walked back to Air Force One.
   Explaining the contradiction between his smile and his sorrow,
the president said later, ``The Bush family's not very good at that
kind of thing, anyway. But you've got to deal with it; you've got
to show them concern. You know how you do it? Pray for strength.''
   Next stop was Chicago for an appearance before newspaper
publishers at the annual meeting of The Associated Press.
   White House aides had considered using the occasion for an
announcement about how Bush will deploy nuclear missiles. However,
the news leaked out several days ago that he wants to proceed with
a mix of MX missiles and single-warhead weapons, denying Bush a
headline-grabbing pronouncement.
   As a result, Bush merely ticked off the accomplishments of his
first three months in office, declaring ``we've made a good start''
and promising ``there's more to come.'' Then he hurried away
without a question and answer session. Next stop was a
tree-planting ceremony in Bismarck, N.D.
   From the media's standpoint, the trip has major faults. There
was no time to file stories after events in Norfolk or Chicago. The
first filing stop was after 5 p.m. EDT _ dangerously late to win a
prime spot in East Coast newspapers.
   TV network correspondents had to drop off in Chicago to get
their spots on the air and then race across country to catch Bush.
   On Wednesday, Bush will hold his first meeting with Reagan since
the inaugural. It will be five hours before time is earmarked for
reporters to send in stories, after Bush arrives in Austin to
address the Texas state legislature. That speech is to focus on
energy issues _ competing with the stories about the Reagan reunion.
   On Thursday, Bush attends an international drug enforcement
conference in Miami, rushes off to dedicate a drug-interdiction
facility, and then hurries off to dedicate an Alzheimer's center.
   The trip concludes two days before the end of Bush's first 100
days in office _ a time for assessments and course corrections.
Members of Bush's White House staff say they expect the next 100
days will be smoother.

   Vice President Dan Quayle headed for Australia
today after paying a courtesy call on Ronald Reagan in California
and praising the former president's support for anti-communist
rebels around the world.
   ``President Reagan didn't just say that freedom works here in
America,'' Quayle said in remarks late Monday in Los Angeles to
Citizens for the Republic, a fund-raising group that Reagan
organized in 1976.
   The vice president then flew across the Pacific, getting in some
exercise en route early today by playing basketball with Secret
Service agents during a refueling stop for Air Force Two at Hickam
Air Force Base near Honolulu.
   Asked about the impending resignation of Japanese Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita amid an influence-peddling scandal, Quayle said he
did not have all the details, but added: ``It's a democracy and
whoever the leader of that democracy is, we'll work with.''
   Noting that Reagan fought for aid to anti-communist guerrillas
in Nicaragua and Afghanistan, Quayle said the ex-president ``wasn't
content to sit back and wait for history to do our work for us; he
wanted to give history a little nudge now and then.''
   Nowhere was the so-called ``Reagan Doctrine'' more successful
than in Afghanistan, where Soviet occupation troops withdrew after
long-running battles with U.S.-backed rebels, Quayle said.
   ``I believe that the defeat of Soviet forces in Afghanistan is
having a profound impact on the evolution of the Soviet political
system,'' Quayle said. ``For in Afghanistan, the central myth of
Soviet rule, the myth of the inevitability of Soviet triumph, was
shattered.''
   The fund-raising group also presented Quayle with its ``Ronald
Reagan Award.''
   At a 30-minute meeting in Reagan's office in a skyscraper with
an ocean view, Quayle presented the former president with the
American flag that had flown over the U.S. Embassy in Kabul until
the Soviets invaded the Afghan capital in 1979.
   The flag was later hoisted May 15, 1988, when the Soviets
announced they would leave the country.
   ``I am very proud to have this,'' Reagan told Quayle as the two
posed for pictures with their wives.
   In a brief question-and-answer session with reporters, Reagan
said President Bush has done well in his first 100 days.
   ``He is there to keep in progress the things we did for eight
years,'' Reagan said.
   Before leaving on his 27,000-mile, 12-day trip to Australia and
Southeast Asia, Quayle attended a fund-raising event for Ronald
Reagan's library and spoke briefly to the American Samoan community.
   The ``bold and strong'' message that Quayle said he would
deliver to allies on his trip is that, ``American is strong _ she
is healthy.''
   After a refueling stop in Pago Pago, the capital of American
Samoa, Quayle's first stop was Canberra, Australia's capital.
   After Australia, Quayle was visiting Indonesia, Singapore and
Thailand before returning to the United States.

<HEAD>5 Black Activists Acquitted of Subversion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union leader acquitted of
charges he tried to take control of an impoverished black township
says he will rebuild the community organizations that authorities
alleged were subversive.
   A judge on Monday acquitted Moses Mayekiso, head of the National
Union of Metalworkers, and four other black activists of subversion
charges ad said the boycotts they organized were legal protests of
poor living conditions.
   Happy supporters carried Mayekiso on their shoulders from the
Supreme Court to the nearby Central Methodist Church after the
verdict. Police ordered the crowd to stop singing and chanting and
told reporters to leave.
   Mayekiso told a news conference later that he and the other
defendants would resume their activities and rebuild the community
organizations that authorities said were undermining the township
government.
   ``We're going to start where we left,'' Mayekiso said. ``The
message we have been given is that the structures are legal.''
   Mayekiso, 48, was charged with attempting a political takeover
in 1985-86 of Alexandra, an impoverished black township adjoining
some of Johannesburg's most luxurious white suburbs.
   He had been jailed for 30 months until Judge P.J. van der Walt
freed him on bail in December.
   Van der Walt said Monday the state presented no direct evidence
that the defendants, their Alexandra Action Committee or the
outlawed African National Congress had planned unrest, attacks on
police, the resignation of township council members or the
establishment of people's courts.
   The judge said he had toured the township and seen the poor
conditions. He said the community had developed a lack of faith and
trust in authorities.
   According to van der Walt, the boycotts were intended to improve
living conditions, not make the township ungovernable.
   The case attracted international attention. In the United
States, United Auto Workers president Owen Bieber called the
prosecution ``malicious and outrageous.''
   ``The South African authorities knew all along that Mayekiso had
committed no crime, but they jailed him for 901 days and subjected
him to a long and costly trial,'' Bieber said in a statement.
   Van der Walt criticized the state for first charging the
defendants with treason. After acknowledging treason could not be
proved, prosecutors substituted the lesser charges of subversion
and sedition.
   In the trial, van der Walt asked the prosecutor whether rent and
consumer boycotts were illegal in 1985-6. The prosecutor
acknowledged they were not, but the government has imposed
emergency decrees since that outlaw the organization of boycotts.
   During that period in Alexandra, dozens of people were killed in
clashes with security forces and in attacks by crowds on township
council members and black policemen. The entire council resigned
and most black policemen moved out of Alexandra.
   Since then, the government has detained or restricted leaders of
the Alexandra Action Committee and undertaken a $45 million
redevelopment program to provide sewage, electricity and paved
streets to most of the 100,000 residents.
   Those acquitted with Mayekiso were Paul Tshabalala, 38; Obed
Bapela, 30; Richard Mdakane, 30, and Mayekiso's brother, Mzwanele,
24.

<HEAD>Bourbon Drinker Asks Damages for Son's Birth Defects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for a 4-year-old with severe birth
defects said the child deserves to be compensated because a liquor
company did not warn the boy's mother of the dangers of drinking
during pregnancy.
   But a lawyer for the James B. Beam Distillery Co. of Deerfield,
Ill., said Monday the mother had been repeatedly warned over a
period of years about the risks of alcohol and she kept drinking up
to a half of a fifth of bourbon per day. No warning on the part of
a manufacturer would have persuaded her to stop, the attorney said.
   Michael Thorp, the 4-year-old son of Harold and Candace Thorp of
Seattle, was born mentally retarded, neurologically impaired,
developmentally stunted and malformed, according to the lawsuit
filed by his parents.
   The Thorps contend that the liquor company should have provided
labels warning that alcohol can cause birth defects. In court
papers, Mrs. Thorp said she didn't know her drinking would damage
her child.
   The case focuses attention on a federal law taking effect in
November that will require labels on all beer, wine or hard liquor
that alcohol can cause health problems and birth defects.
   In his opening statement Monday, a lawyer for the boy and his
parents, Barry M. Epstein, said Michael was the victim of fetal
alcohol syndrome and deserves enough money to take care of him for
the rest of his life.
   Epstein said Beam knew about a link between alcohol and birth
defects in 1978 but made no effort to inform the public. Beam
decided, along with 22 competitors, not to place warnings on its
beverages, Epstein said.
   Had warning labels existed and the information been out, the
Thorps ``could have acted to see what could be done to safeguard
this child,'' he said.
   In opening statements by the defense, lawyer Shannon Stafford
said, ``Family members and doctors tried for years to get Candy to
stop drinking. ... (She) ignored every warning she got.
   ``Evidence will demonstrate that Candace Thorp was warned not
once but repeatedly'' about the possible effect of alcohol on
pregnancy, he said. ``A warning on a bottle label would not have
done any good.''
   He also said he will prove that Michael's rate of development is
not much different from that of his older sister, and that his
condition is due to poor nutrition during pregnancy, heredity, and
severe neglect during his early years by parents who are admitted
alcoholics.
   In court documents, lawyers for Beam said, ``Beam does not
concede that maternal alcohol consumption causes birth defects.''
   An estimated 30,000 children are born each year nationwide with
fetal alcohol syndrome, according to a 1982 study by researchers at
the University of Washington's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute.

<HEAD>Liverpool Leader Asks Royal Family To Attend Stadium Memorial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Liverpool City Council leader today urged Queen
Elizabeth II or members of her immediate family to attend a
memorial service for the 95 soccer fans killed in Britain's worst
sports disaster.
   ``It is never too late to do the right thing,'' city council
leader Keva Coombes said on British Broadcasting Corp. radio. ``All
we can do is say we think you're making a mistake. Please, please
come.''
   The only members of Britain's royalty planning to attend
Saturday's service in Liverpool are the Duke and Duchess of Kent.
The duke, the queen's cousin, is president of the Football
Association.
   Buckingham Palace has said the queen and her husband will send a
representative, the Lord Lieutenant of Merseyside, Kenneth
Stoddart. A message from the queen will be read aloud by church
leaders conducting the service.
   Coombes, leader of Liverpool's Labor Party-controlled local
government, said the royal family is out of touch with ordinary
Britons.
   ``It looks as if their advisers are ... are starting to lose the
feel of ordinary men and women up and down the country, who are
very keen on the monarchy,'' he said.
   Britain's royal family also was criticized for failing to attend
a memorial service for the 270 people killed in the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103.
   Coombes said either the queen, her husband or one of their
children should attend Saturday's service for Liverpool fans who
were crushed to death at a soccer match in Sheffield on April 15.
   Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, and his wife
Princess Diana visited the injured at a hospital in Sheffield.
Buckingham Palace said today that Charles would visit the Liverpool
Football Club next week.
   ``Everybody appreciates their going to the hospitals and
comforting those who are alive, but I think they need to listen a
bit more closely perhaps to ordinary men and women than some of
their advisers in London,'' Coombes said.

   Two pregnant correction officers say a city
health official told them to have abortions or face losing their
jobs.
   The Department of Correction said the complaint resulted from a
misunderstanding, but the head of the correction officers' union
called Monday for the official's resignation.
   Phil Seelig, president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent
Association, charged that Leon Silverberg, director of the Health
Management Division of the Department of Correction, gave the
ultimatum last week to Livinia Forts, 21, and Alethea Hutchinson,
31. Both were hired March 2 and assigned to the department training
academy.
   Emily Steinberg, an attorney for the union, said an action
charging discrimination would be taken in federal court.
   Seelig said it ``appears to be part of a department conspiracy
to violate the civil and human rights of pregnant officers and
their babies in direct contradiction of the law.''
   Silverberg was out sick Monday and could not be reached for
comment. Correction Department spokeswoman Ruby Ryles called the
complaints a misunderstanding and said the circumstances were being
reviewed.
   Ms. Forts said that when she learned she was pregnant, she asked
to be excused from some strenuous exercises in gym class. She said
she was told to see Silverberg.
   ``He told me I had two options which are either to resign or to
have an abortion to continue my job,'' she said.
   ``I'm confused. I'm scared to work under these conditions,'' she
said. ``It felt like I don't have any rights at all. It's
horrible!''
   Mrs. Hutchinson, who has two daughters ages 9 and 13, said that
when she found out she was pregnant, she also was told to see
Silverberg.
   Silverberg ``told me I was to get an abortion or be fired,''
Mrs. Hutchinson said. She said Silverberg indicated he had given
similar advice to three other pregnant officers.

<HEAD>Communist Leader Says Slaying U. S. Colonel Was Not Bad</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The founder of the outlawed
Philippine Communist Party said today the rebel slaying of a U.S.
colonel was justified because of American ``aggression'' in the
country.
   ``I think we cannot say that what happened was bad at all,''
Jose Maria Sison told a Manila radio station of the killing Friday
of Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe, 51, a Vietnam War hero and former
prisoner-of-war.
   Communist rebels have said they shot and killed Rowe. The
McAllen, Texas, man was ambushed en route to work at the Joint U.S.
Military Advisory Group headquarters.
   ``The United States continues with perpetuated aggression,''
Sison, who lives in the Netherlands, told independent radio DZXL.
   U.S. officials said Rowe's body will be flown to the United
States today, but they refused to give further details at the
request of his family.
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said Rowe's killing
adds a new dimension to the 20-year-old Communist insurgency.
   ``They are apparently targeting foreign nationals and that is a
new situation for all of us,'' de Villa told reporters. ``You
cannot win a war in the Philippines through assassination and
murder.''
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos charged the rebels are escalating
``their terror campaign'' because ``they have failed in their
military struggle'' against the Philippines armed forces.''
   He called on the public to rally behind the government so the
international community sees it can ``effectively take measures to
protect the population and also our foreign visitors.''
   Police chief Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano said police are more
interested in destroying the rebel capability for assassinations
than in arresting individual killers.
   ``It is immaterial whether we get the real hit men or not,''
Montano said. ``What is more important to us is the destruction of
their terror machinery. The Communist hit man can be anybody.''
   The United States maintains six military facilities in the
country, including Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, both
north of Manila. The lease on the bases expires in 1991.
   Last Sunday, the Communist-led National Democratic Front urged
political parties to ally themselves with the front in its campaign
against the bases.
   ``I think it is preferable that a national alliance is created
to fight and oust the Americans from the bases,'' Sison told the
radio station.
   He founded the Communist Party in the Philippines in 1968 and
was arrested Nov. 10, 1977. He remained in jail until a month after
President Corazon Aquino took office in 1986. Sison then went
abroad and won political asylum in the Netherlands last year after
the military filed subversion charges against him.

   Princess Tokhye, one of the last
survivors of the ancient Yi Dynasty that ruled Korea for five
centuries, was buried today amid prayers for the woman one mourner
called ``the unhappy princess.''
   Official mourners dressed in traditional white hemp clothes and
tall hats carried the lacquered black coffin to the grave site on a
hillside in the royal burial grounds east of Seoul.
   The princess died Friday at age 77.
   ``She was the most beautiful and most noble of princesses,''
said Alice Kim, who attended the funeral. ``And she was the most
sad.''
   The grave site was chosen by a traditional pungsu, or fortune
teller, who decides the most auspicious location and timing of a
burial. He used a compass to align the casket in keeping with a
Korean belief that a corpses' feet must point south to ensure a
happy afterlife.
   Lee Hae-suk, a member of the Yi Dynasty Association who helped
arrange the ceremonies, said Princess Tokhye probably wouldn't mind
if her feet didn't quite point due south because her life had been
difficult.
   ``She was a very unhappy princess,'' said Lee. ``She would be
used to being a little off.''
   About 75 people, many of them spectators, attended a traditional
Confucian burial ceremony at Changdok Palace in central Seoul,
where the princess spent the last years of her life as a recluse.
The body was then taken to the royal burial grounds.
   Princess Tokhye, a daughter of King Kojong, the last Yi king,
was born to a royal concubine named Yang in 1912, two years after
her father was forced to abdicate by the Japanese, who took control
of Korea.
   At age 13, she was sent to school in Japan and later married a
Japanese nobleman much older than herself. Her mother died before
she could return to Korea and her only child committed suicide.
   In 1951, the princess was divorced from her Japanese husband and
in 1962 she returned to her homeland, suffering from diabetes and
aphasia.
   Visitors said she was sometimes heard humming or singing to
herself, but she hadn't spoken for many years.

   With a nurse monitoring the blood pressure of
one panel member, the jury in Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial
resumed deliberations today.
   The 12 members beginning their fourth day of considering North's
fate have yet to actually discuss his guilt or innocence, with
their time so far spent reviewing documents.
   ``We are reading through documents that pertain to charges,''
jury foreman Denise Anderson said in a note to the judge Monday,
adding, ``No talking.''
   Juror Jean Johnson, 53, experienced bouts of high blood pressure
Monday and a note sent out to the judge in the afternoon asked for
a nurse to take her blood pressure. The monitoring continued today.
   Federal court rules provide that a jury can proceed with 11
members at a judge's discretion. Losing two members, however, would
in all likelihood result in a mistrial. There is a provision under
which a jury could reach a verdict with fewer than 11 members if
both sides agreed to it and the judge approves it.
   North is charged with 12 criminal counts, including lying to
Congress and to the attorney general during the Iran-Contra affair,
illegally converting travelers checks to his own use and conspiring
to defraud the Treasury.
   At the jury's request, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
moved it out of a small room across from the judge's chambers and
into the main courtroom where North's trial took place. The jurors
were deliberating around the two big tables where prosecutors and
North's lawyers tried the case.
   Meanwhile, at least one of the panel's members was angered by an
invitation to give interviews after the trial is over.
   Gesell said that NBC News had left unsigned letters at the
jurors' homes containing the invitations. He called it ``most
inappropriate ... quite disrespectful of the situation we are
dealing with.''
   One of the letters was picked up by a deputy U.S. marshal, who
informed the juror and withheld the document.
   The juror ``was angry'' about having gotten the letter and
mentioned it to other members of the panel, who ``said they didn't
want anything to do with'' the invitation, said the judge.
   NBC News spokeswoman Peggy Hubble in New York said, ``It was
intended for them to see them when they got home after they made
their decision after the trial. ... I think once people understand
what happened, there's not much of a problem with it really.''
   She added, ``We're sorry if there was any inconvenience or
misinterpretation.''

<HEAD>A Killer of Pro-Solidarity Priest Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of four security policemen convicted
of killing the pro-Solidarity priest Jerzy Popieluszko has been
freed from prison after four years, the government said today.
   Deputy government spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowski said Waldemar
Chmielewski was released, but said he did not know when he left
prison.
   Chmielewski's sentence _ which has been reduced twice _ was to
expire the third week in April.
   He was sentenced to 14 years' jail in February 1985 for his part
in the 1984 kidnapping and murder of Popieluszko, a Roman Catholic
priest who fervently supported the independent trade union that was
banned by authorities at the time.
   Popieluszko's body was recovered from the Vistula river
northwest of Warsaw.
   The other officers received longer sentences and a court upheld
the verdicts during a 1985 appeal.
   However, Chmielewski's sentence later was reduced twice, most
recently in 1987 when the Supreme Court cut his prison term to four
years on humanitarian grounds.
   The sentences of the other three killers also have been reduced
sharply.
   Popieluszko has become a symbol of Solidarity's struggle and his
grave at the Warsaw church where he served has become a pilgrimage
site for Poles and foreigners.
   This weekend, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa laid flowers on the
grave to mark the priest's name day.
   Solidarity was suppressed when martial law was declared in
December 1981, and outlawed the following October. It was legalized
earlier this month.

   Palestinian attackers today stabbed to death
two Arabs accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab reports said.
   The deaths were the latest of several recent attacks on alleged
collaborators. Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising had
called for Wednesday to be a day of vengeance against Arabs aiding
the Israelis.
   Army officials said they were unaware of the two deaths.
   Three Palestinians were reported shot and wounded in clashes
with soldiers today, one in the West Bank city of Hebron, another
in the Gaza Strip city of Khan Yunis and a third in Gaza's Shati
refugee camp.
   Seven children between the ages 8 and 14 also were struck with
rubber-coated metal pellets in confrontations with troops in Khan
Yunis and Gaza City, Arab reports and hospital officials said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   In the West Bank town of Suseya, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
urged Israeli Jews to keep settling the occupied lands. The
government said Foreign Minister Moshe Arens would visit the United
States next month to give details of Shamir's plan to hold
Palestinian elections in the territories occupied in the 1967
Middle East war.
   In Khan Yunis, Fauzi Muhareb, 45, was fatally stabbed near his
home early today, Palestinian reporters said.
   The reporters, who requested anonymity for their own safety,
said Muhareb was a collaborator and a drug dealer. Israel radio
said police arrested three suspects.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, the body of a 21-year-old
Palestinian who was beaten and fatally stabbed was brought to a
hospital. The victim, identified as Azam Qadi, was described as a
collaborator by Palestinian sources.
   In a leaflet issued nearly two weeks ago, the Unified National
Leadership of the Uprising called for Wednesday to be ``a day of
accounting for the collaborators.''
   Within the past week, at least five alleged collaborators were
reported killed in the occupied lands.
   The latest deaths would bring to 24 the number of Palestinians
slain as alleged collaborators this year, in addition to 11 last
year, Palestinian sources say.
   Not counting the two reported deaths today, 444 Palestinians
have been killed in the uprising, most by army gunfire during
stone-throwing clashes. Eighteen Israelis also have been killed.
   Israel radio reported today that uprising leaders called for the
rape of Palestinian women as a way of forcing their husbands to
stop working in Israel. It said the threat had been carried out
against six Gaza women.
   But Brig. Gen. Zvi Poleg, Israel Defense Force commander in the
Gaza Strip, said he had no reports of sexual assault in connection
with the revolt.
   Shamir, speaking at the dedication of a new archaeological park
aimed at luring more tourists to the West Bank, said Israelis would
settle in all regions where Jews once lived.
   ``In every place where Jews ever set foot in past generations,
the Jewish people shall return,'' Shamir told 4,000 people in
Suseya in the Judean desert.
   Shamir's visit to the occupied lands comes as he tries to win
U.S. support for his Middle East peace plan.
   Washington has been trying to get Shamir to halt Jewish
settlement in the occupied territories, where about 70,000 settlers
live amid 1.7 million Palestinians.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Arens would travel to
Washington in mid-May to discuss the plan further. The plan
includes proposals to hold elections in the occupied lands and
improve conditions for Palestinian refugees.
   Shamir rejects any PLO participation in the negotiations and the
U.S. ``land for peace'' formula.

<HEAD>Former Prime Minister Heath ``Affronted'' At Defeat By A Woman</HEAD>
<HEAD>For Release at noon EDT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Edward Heath, whom Margaret
Thatcher ousted as Conservative Party leader in 1975, felt
affronted at being defeated by a woman, a former deputy prime
minister said in a television interview released today.
   Lord Whitelaw, who was deputy prime minister until retiring last
year, said Heath also felt betrayed by the party. He spoke on a
British Broadcasting Corp. program about him titled, ``The Power
Behind the throne,'' which is to be broadcast Wednesday.
   Whitelaw said he, too, was ``desperately upset'' when Mrs.
Thatcher defeated Heath and he doubted that a woman could lead a
political party or be prime minister.
   ``That is a dreadful male chauvinist remark, but it had never
happened before,'' Whitelaw said. ``So I had these questions in my
mind. Was the country ready to vote for a woman as a leader? Would
she have the strength of purpose? ... Would she be able to control
a whole lot of men in a Cabinet?''
   ``That makes one laugh today but it was true then,'' Whitelaw
said.
   Mrs. Thatcher ousted Heath after he lost two consecutive
elections. She became prime minister when the Conservative Party
won power again in 1979.
   In the leadership contest, Mrs. Thatcher outpolled Heath in a
first ballot among Conservative members of Parliament. Heath
withdrew, Whitelaw joined the contest in the second ballot and she
defeated him, too.
   Whitelaw, 70, became a trusted Thatcher supporter, serving in
her Cabinets and being made a peer in 1983. He was deputy prime
minister until he quit after suffering a stroke last year.
   In contrast, Heath, 72, is an embittered rank-and-file
legislator who periodically attacks Mrs. Thatcher publicly.
   Whitelaw described Heath's attitude as ``strange and sad.''
   ``But I think Ted felt desperately and totally betrayed by the
party,'' said Whitelaw.
   ``So this rather shy, rather withdrawn man, felt deeply
affronted,'' said Whitelaw. ``Certainly he would mind more than
most people who had been beaten by a woman. Most men wouldn't like
it, but I think he minded more.''

   A USS Iowa crewman who was in the gun turret
that exploded and killed 47 sailors says he was waiting for its
massive 16-inch guns to fire but the blast he heard ``didn't sound
right.''
   After the explosion, Kendall L. Truitt recalled Monday, he and
10 others in the bottom of the turret tried to radio sailors on the
five upper decks but none answered.
   ``We knew that something was drastically wrong,'' said the
gunner's mate 3rd class, who is from Tampa, Fla.
   He said he then ordered the gunpowder magazine secured and the
area evacuated.
   The quick actions of the 11 and other Iowa crewmen were critical
in preventing an even bigger tragedy aboard the World War II-era
battleship, Capt. Fred P. Moosally said.
   ``I can't say enough about the hundreds of heroes who fought the
fire and saved the ship,'' Moosally said. ``God gave birth to 500
heroes.''
   The two spoke at a news conference several hours after a
memorial service for the victims at the Norfolk Naval Air Station,
the Iowa's home port.
   About 6,000 mourners heard President Bush praise ``the men
behind the guns.''
   ``They came to the Navy as strangers, served the Navy as
shipmates and friends, and left the Navy as brothers in eternity,''
Bush said. Afterward, he and his wife, Barbara, consoled victims'
families.
   Navy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of
Wednesday's blast that occurred during a gunnery exercise off
Puerto Rico. Officials said they had no idea when an investigation
would be completed.
   ``There was a tremendous amount of damage done and of course
lives were lost so it will be a very thorough investigation,'' Lt.
Cmdr. Steve Burnett, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk,
said today.
   ``There are lots of theories floating around,'' Moosally said.
``Unfortunately, all the witnesses are dead.''
   Officials also said they haven't finished assessing the damage
to the turret.
   Moosally refused to give a definite answer to questions about
whether the turret could be repaired. He said the battleship could
operate without it if necessary.
   The Iowa has three turrets, each with three 16-inch guns.
   The captain said there were no indications of any problems with
the guns before the blast.
   The No. 1 turret had already fired its rounds, Moosally said,
while in the second turret, the practice projectiles and five
110-pound bags of powder had been loaded into the right and left
guns.
   Moosally said a projectile was loaded into the center gun and
the crew was loading powder behind it when the explosion occurred.
   ``That was my best turret,'' Moosally said. ``The turret's
senior chief was the most meticulous man I've ever met. You talk
about training ... nobody in that turret did anything unless they
were qualified. Of the 84 chiefs on the ship, he was No. 1.''
   He was referring to Chief Gunner's Mate Reginald O. Ziegler of
Port Gibson, N.Y. Ziegler, 39, was the oldest victim.
   The ship's weapons control officer, Cmdr. Robert J. Kissinger,
said the guns had passed a rigorous inspection that morning. They
had been fired last in early February, he said.
   The powder also had been inspected before the exercise,
Kissinger said.
   Truitt said the 11 on the turret's bottom level were not sure
what had happened immediately after the blast, but they ``knew that
didn't sound right.''
   The men opened a door leading to the next level and immediately
realized the turret was on fire. They escaped through a hatch that
led to ladders outside the turret.
   ``As I was crawling out of the space ... smoke was filling all
the spaces,'' Truitt said. The first thing that came to mind was a
nearby magazine full of powder, he said.
   Seven minutes after the explosion, Moosally ordered the ship's
magazines flooded to prevent the fire from spreading and causing a
larger blast.
   Truitt said there was a special bond among the 25 men in the
turret with the rating of gunner's mate. Only one other survived
with him.
   ``I lost 23 friends right there,'' he said. Some of his
shipmates haven't recovered from the shock, Truitt said, ``but I'm
working on it.''
   Moosally said he expected some crewmen would ask to leave the
battleship after the trauma of the accident, but Truitt said he
would be willing to serve in a turret again.
   ``I don't see the likelihood that it will ever happen again,''
he said.
   Moosally vowed when the ship goes to sea again, ``I'll be in the
turret when the first shot goes up.''

<HEAD>Gingrich Book Partnership Reported Tax Loss Of More than $100,000</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The partnership created in 1984 to promote a
book co-authored by House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich reported a
loss of more than $100,000 during its first five years, according
to partnership tax returns released today by Gingrich.
   The COS Limited Partnership was formed by 21 individuals or
corporations that each put up $5,000 to pay for a promotional
campaign for ``Window of Opportunity,'' written by Gingrich, his
wife, Marianne Gingrich, and David Drake. One person, Janet Morris,
received a $5,000 share of the partnership for editorial work.
   The partnership is the subject of a formal complaint filed with
the House ethics committee by Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., accusing
Gingrich of 10 apparent violations of House rules. The committee
has not indicated whether it will launch a preliminary
investigation of Alexander's complaint.
   Gingrich initiated the investigation that resulted in the filing
of 69 ethics charges against House Speaker Jim Wright last week.
   Gingrich has denied any wrongdong in connection with the book
deal.
   He released several hundred pages of documents today identifying
the 21 partners and detailing the organization's finances and
incorporation history. The documents, including the partnership's
tax returns for 1984-1988, were released in response to questions
submitted by news organizations.
   The partnership agreement with the book's publisher provided
that the partnership would get half of the publisher's profits in
exchange for promoting the book.
   But despite the partnership's expenditure of $51,571 to
advertise and promote the book from 1984 through 1986, the
publisher reported to Gingrich and his wife in 1988 that there was
a net loss of $6,259 on the book.
   The 1988 accounting from the publisher showed that 58,996 copies
of the book were sold to bookstores, but 29,981 of those copies
were returned. Net sales of the book totaled $122,120.
   Because the partnership received no profits from the book sales,
the $104,185 loss it generated between 1984 and 1988 was
distributed among the partners, providing them with tax writeoffs.
   Mrs. Gingrich, as general partner of the partnership, received a
$10,000 payment in 1984 for her work in setting up the
organization, and later was given a 2 percent interest in the
partnership for her work, according to the documents. She did not
invest any of her own money in the partnership.
   In written responses to questions from reporters, Mrs. Gingrich
said she also received a recent $1,500 payment from the partnership
``for part of the work I have done since the partnership was
formed.''
   ``I have worked hard in organizing and running this
partnership,'' Mrs. Gingrich said.``I have been paid for my work
and my legal responsibilities. According to the partnership
agreement, I am entitled to more than I have been paid so far.''
   Alexander's complaint alleges in part that the payments and
ownership interest in the partnership that Mrs. Gingrich received
were gifts that violated House rules limiting gifts that members
may receive.
   The complaint also alleged that because of the unusual nature of
the partnership promotional deal, the royalties Gingrich and his
wife received from the book do not fit the definition of royalties
in House rules and thus constitute a violation of House limits on
outside income.
   According to the documents released by Gingrich, he and his wife
each received $7,018 in royalties from the publisher. Under the
agreement with the publisher, the three authors received a total 10
percent royalty on hardback sales and 8 percent on paperbacks.
   While the documents identify the 22 partners in the book
promotional deal, Gingrich did not respond to questions about
whether he had intervened with any agency of the federal government
in behalf of any of the investors.
   The 21 investors were Richmond N. Aggrey of Peachtree City, Ga.;
Bigard Oil and Manufacturing Co. of Newton, Ill.; Joe Coors of
Golden, Colo.; Jeanne R. Ferst of Atlanta; Richard A. Guthman Jr.
of Atlanta; Robert H. Krieble of Old Lyme, Conn.; Roger Milliken of
Spartanburg, S.C.; O.D. Resources Inc. of Atlanta; Gregor Peterson
of Incline Village, Nev.; Roger Schoerner of Carrollton, Ga.;
Marguerite Williams of Thomasville, Ga.;
   John M. Barrell of Peachtree City, Ga.; Howard H. Calloway of
Denver, Colo.; Joel H. Cowan of Peachtree City, Ga.; Flowers
Industries of Thomasville, Ga.; Jean Hails of Roswell, Ga.; Estate
of William F. McClain, College Park, Ga.; Janet Morris, Mashpee,
Mass.; Diane Parker of Thomasville, Ga.; James C. Richards of
Carrollton, Ga.; Thomas E. Tidwell of Douglasville, Ga.; and Thomas
L. Williams III of Thomasville, Ga.

<HEAD>West Germany Insists On Superpower Talks On Short-Range Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany said today it was
sticking with its demand for superpower talks on short-range
nuclear weapons despite Washington's refusal to begin such
negotiations.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher also said West Germany
would be speaking with other NATO partners about the internal
alliance dispute over the short-range weapons.
   ``We are going into the talks with our partners with the same
position that we have already worked out,'' Genscher told reporters.
   Genscher and Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg had just
returned from Washington, where they tried to convince U.S.
officials of the need to take up early talks with the Soviets on
reducing short-range nuclear weapons.
   The United States and Britain are concerned that negotiating the
missiles issue with the Soviets could lead to stripping the NATO
allies of their ground-based nuclear weaponry, leaving them at the
mercy of stronger Warsaw Pact conventional forces.
   Most of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's short-range
nuclear weapons _ 88 Lance launchers with a range of up to about 75
miles _ are based in West Germany.
   West Germany also is opposed to U.S. proposals to upgrade the
Lance missiles. The issues are expected to be at the forefront of
the NATO summit in Brussels at the end of May.
   West Germany's support for talks on the short-range weapons
comes amid a growing anti-military mood among the populace and
predictions that Chancellor Helmut Kohl could lose next year's
elections.
   The missiles are a subject of irritation in West Germany.
Because of their short range, the nuclear-tipped missiles are
designed to hit targets almost exclusively on German soil.
   Genscher said his talks with U.S. officials had resulted in a
``better understanding'' of the positions of both sides, but he
gave no indication there would soon be a breakthrough in attempts
to resolve the dispute.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain will fly to Bonn on
Sunday to try to persuade Kohl to suspend his campaign for
U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the issue.
   Kohl has support among several of the smaller NATO countries,
including Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.

   A Cuban family from Florida stranded in
Canada since a pre-Christmas sightseeing trip because of
immigration problems reportedly may soon be allowed to return home.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service District Director
Benedict J. Ferro will approve Carlos Fajardo's bid for political
asylum within the next few weeks, ending the family's exile in Fort
Erie, Ontario, The Buffalo News reported today.
   Fajardo, his wife, Bermaida Zamora-Powers, and her two children
have lived on charity since Dec. 23, when they were denied re-entry
into the United States at the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls.
   The couple, both considered illegal aliens, told border
authorities that they had driven north to see snow for Christmas
and had crossed the border into Canada to view Niagara Falls.
   Fajardo owns a home and a small boat-building business in Miami.
Officials have alleged he entered the United States illegally in
1985 from Panama. His wife and her children by a previous marriage
allegedly entered the country illegally in 1986 from Venezuela and
an immigration judge ordered them deported last August.
   Ferro would not discuss the case in detail but confirmed that
new information could substantiate Fajardo's claims that he would
face political persecution if he were returned to his native Cuba.
   ``Mr. Fajardo's claim is clearly not frivolous,'' Ferro said
told the News. ``If indeed it proves to rise to the level of a
well-founded fear of being persecuted if returned to Cuba, we will
grant him asylum.''
   ``It looks like we may be able to work something out,'' said
Sister Kathleen Rimar, Fajardo's Catholic Charities attorney in
Buffalo.
   After they were denied re-entry, the Fajardos lived for several
weeks in a motel in Niagara Falls, Ontario, then in a Fort Erie
apartment under the sponsorship of Ontario refugee groups.
   Fajardo had a previous application for asylum pending, but it
was nullified when he crossed the border into Canada, officials
said.

   Police were examining evidence from
skeletal remains found along a highway to see if it fits the
pattern of a serial killer or killers believed to have slain at
least eight women in the area.
   The remains were found Monday by state workers clearing brush
along Interstate 195, about 12 miles east of Dartmouth, where
bodies of four of the eight victims were found, also along the
highway.
   ``The parallels are there,'' said John Corbett, assistant
district attorney for Plymouth County. ``It's certainly reasonable
to make the assumption that there is some connection between them.''
   James Martin, a spokesman for Ronald Pina, Bristol County
district attorney, said a brief examination of the scene in Marion
indicated there were ``exact, numerous similarities'' between the
eight victims and Monday's discovery.
   Corbett would not say whether the body was that of a male or
female, and added that officials were not able to determine whether
it was a homicide. An autopsy was to be done today.
   Three other victims were found along Route 140 in Freetown, and
the eighth was found along Route 88 in Westport. The three
locations, all within a 10-mile radius, are in Bristol County;
Marion is in Plymouth County.
   The eight dead women had ties to Weld Square, an area of New
Bedford associated with prostitution and drugs.
   Police have said that as many as three missing women may be
additional victims.

<TEXT>
   Christian army units and Syrian gunners
poured rocket and artillery fire on Beirut in an escalation of
violence today, the eve of an Arab League meeting aimed at ending
the fighting.
   Police said at least two people were killed and 16 wounded in
the bombardment, which began at midnight and raged until 6 a.m.,
then dwindled to sporadic exchanges.
   The deaths raised to 272 killed and 991 wounded the toll since
the latest round of fighting broke out March 8 in the 14-year-old
civil war that pits Christians against Moslems.
   The city shook as army troops under Gen. Michel Aoun fired 155mm
and 130mm howitzer and mortar shells into Moslem west Beirut. The
only sound other than the blasts of shells was the occasional siren
of a Civil Defense ambulance.
   Civilians scurried to basements and underground shelters.
   The Syrians opened up on east Beirut, the heart of the besieged
310-square-mile Christian enclave, with 240mm mortars and BM-21
launchers, which fire 40 122mm rockets in 20 seconds.
   Four shells crashed in the garden of east Beirut's Comfort
Hotel, which houses offices of U.N. peacekeepers and the U.N.
Relief and Works Agency, police said. Windows were shattered and
windshields of five U.N. cars were blown out, the hotel and a U.N.
official said.
   Shells destroyed the facade of the three-story Goethe Institute,
a West German cultural center in west Beirut.
   Police said west Beirut's Sahel hospital on the main airport
highway took several direct hits that damaged equipment but hurt no
patients.
   On Monday, Moslem forces fired rockets at a French tanker as it
delivered fuel to restart power stations, police reported. Much of
Lebanon, including Beirut, has been without electricity since fuel
for power stations' generators ran out nine days ago.
   Police said four rockets crashed into the Mediterranean about
700 yards from the French navy tanker, the Penhors, as it unloaded
4,000 tons of fuel in the Christian town of Zouk north of Beirut.
   The salvo was fired despite what Christian officers called
``solid guarantees'' given to French Ambassador Paul Blanc by
Christian and Syrian commanders that there would be no shooting
while the tanker unloaded.
   The delivery of the fuel oil caused an interruption in the
stream of refugees fleeing Beirut from the Christian-controlled
port of Jounieh north of the city. An aide to Aoun said he ordered
two Cypriot-flag ferries to stop picking up Christians while the
Penhors unloaded.
   Foreign ministers of the 22-member Arab League are to meet in an
emergency session in Tunis, Tunisia, on Wednesday to find ways to
end the violence. Three cease-fires arranged by the league have
collapsed.
   An Arab League committee will recommend that the group send an
observer force of people from all Arab states to monitor a
cease-fire, said Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed.
   The current fighting erupted after Aoun, who heads the Christian
government vying for legitimacy with a rival Moslem cabinet,
clamped a blockade on illegal ports run by Moslem militias south of
Beirut in a bid to restore long-eroded state authority.
   The Druse Progressive Socialist Party retaliated by shelling the
Christian enclave. They soon were joined by the Syrians, who
maintain 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   ``The observer force will not be a deterrent one, but rather a
symbolic force assigned to oversee a cease-fire,'' Sabah said in
Kuwait.
   The truce would be an interim step aimed at stabilizing the
situation in Lebanon until a political solution is worked out, with
provisions for arranging presidential elections and the formation
of a a coalition government.
   Syria has said it will attend the Arab League meeting.

<DATELINE>KALPAKKAM, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists at an Indian laboratory have
achieved nuclear fusion in an electrolytic cell, a process first
reported by two University of Utah researchers in March, an Indian
researcher said.
   The experiment at the Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research
in this city on the Bay of Bengal 40 miles south of Madras differs
slightly from the Utah work.
   Cherian K. Mathews said in an interview that he and two
associates achieved the ``cold fusion'' April 16 after three days
of experiments.
   He said the team used titanium cathode and platinum anode dipped
in so-called heavy water, which contains a form of hydrogen called
deuterium that has a neutron in its nucleus. The Utah researchers
had used a cathode made of a palladium, a highly expensive element,
to achieve cold fusion.
   Cold fusion aims at getting the deuterium atoms to fuse, forming
helium and releasing energy.
   The reaction occurs at room temperature and hence is called cold
fusion. Previously fusion had been achieved under extremely high
temperature and pressure, as seen in the core of the sun.
   Mathews said his team experimented with ordinary water and heavy
water. He said there was a significant increase in temperature
(heat) during the experiment with heavy water, as compared to
ordinary water.
   That suggests that the reaction involved nuclear processes, such
as fusion, rather than chemical processes. Heavy water and ordinary
water are chemically identical.
   The team did not measure the energy output. But Mathews said
they had rough estimates of energy during the different
experiments. He did not give details.
   The team also noticed an increase in the number of neutrons
emitted but these could not be reproduced at will, he said.
   Mathews, 50, said he had worked with India's Atomic Energy
Department after receiving a doctorate from McMaster University in
Hamilton, Ontario.

<HEAD>Court Tosses Out Dispute Over Lotteries in Minnesota Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, by a 6-3 vote, today tossed
out a dispute over the federal government's power to ban newspapers
from publishing lists of winners in privately run lotteries.
   The justices ruled that a controversy from Minnesota has become
moot because the government no longer intends to enforce the ban.
   ``We conclude that there is no longer any live controversy on
the issue of whether the (challenged) statute is constitutional as
it applies to prize lists, and that this appeal is moot,'' the
court said in an unsigned opinion.
   Justices Byron R. White and Thurgood Marshall cast dissenting
votes but did not explain why.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a brief dissenting opinion, said
the court should have reversed _ not merely set aside _ a federal
judge's ruling that had upheld the publishing ban.
   The Minnesota Newspaper Association originally challenged a
postal law that bars newspapers from carrying advertisements and
prize lists.
   Postal laws currently prohibit use of the mails to disseminate
information about any lottery not run by a state. Since nearly all
newspapers rely on the mail for at least a portion of their
distribution, the postal laws apply to them.
   But after the justices agreed last October to study the case,
Congress enacted a new law, to take effect in May 1990, dropping
the ban on advertising for private lotteries. The newspaper
association and the government agreed to drop that part of the case.
   Government lawyers then told the justices that the existing ban
on publishing prize winners will not be enforced.
   The dispute had focused on lotteries and other gaming, such as
bingo and raffles, sponsored by non-profit, charitable
organizations and others.
   Lawyers for the Minnesota newspapers said, ``The revenue
generated by charitable gaming is very substantial. In Minnesota
alone it appears to exceed $200 million per year.''
   U.S. District Judge Paul A. Magnuson upheld the ban on lottery
advertising even though he acknowledged that the ads are a
constitutionally protected form of commercial speech. The newspaper
association appealed.
   The judge, however, ruled that newspapers cannot be barred from
running lists of private lottery winners unless such lists are
found in advertisements. The government had appealed that part of
his ruling.
   The case is Frank vs. Minnesota Newspaper Association, 87-1956.

<HEAD>Authorities Jail 25 In Sunday's Protest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moscow courts jailed 25 people and fined 18 who
took part in a protest against the violent crackdown on
demonstrators in the Soviet republic of Georgia, an activist said
today.
   Yuri Mityunov of the Democratic Union said in a telephone
interview that most of the jail sentences ranged from seven to 15
days, and that other protesters were fined between $160 and $480.
   They were arrested during a demonstration Sunday on Moscow's
Pushkin Square. The rally was called by the Democratic Union, which
bills itself as an alternative to the Communist Party.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said Sunday that 47 people
were arrested, but the daily Moskovskaya Pravda reported today that
more than 70 people were arrested.
   In court cases completed by midday today, Moskovskaya Pravda
said, seven people were warned, 13 were fined and 15 received
administrative punishments. It did not specify what the
administrative punishments were, but many were likely to be brief
jail sentences handed out for violating rules of the Soviet
administrative code.
   In addition to the 25 jail sentences and 18 fines, Mityunov said
six people were warned and that it was uncertain what happened to
eight others. He said one resident of Kiev had been sent back to
the Ukrainian capital.
   There was no explanation for the discrepancies between
Mityunov's figures and those published by Moskovskaya Pravda.
   Thousands gathered at the square in central Moscow on Sunday
even though the demonstration was banned and authorities warned
they would arrest protesters.
   The rally lasted several hours and a special Interior Ministry
police force waded into the crowds to seize some protest leaders.
   Hundreds of people then marched about a mile from the square to
the Arbat pedestrian mall where they held a memorial meeting for
those killed in Georgia.
   Nineteen civilians were killed in a clash between soldiers and
demonstrators on April 9 in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, and one
young man was later shot and killed for a curfew violation.
   Officials in Moscow condemned the crackdown and the party
leaders in the republic were ousted and replaced. Officials
revealed that some of the victims of the clashes were killed by a
gas used against demonstrators.
   In Tbilisi, the Georgian minister of health pledged today to
pressure military authorities to reveal the type of gas used.
   Irakli Managarishvili told reporters an investigation by
military prosecutors into charges a poisonous gas was used was
ordered by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Doctors say some gas victims are suffering from paralysis of the
central nervous systems.
   Several dozen of the approximately 105 patients still
hospitalized in the Georgian capital after inhaling the gas signed
a letter Monday to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealing for an
antidote.

   The Communist Party today accused a small group
of students of conspiring to undermine the government by stirring
unrest, and officials warned workers not to shut down factories in
sympathy with the protesters.
   Students at Beijing universities today boycotted classes for a
second day to appeal for democracy, freedom of speech and press,
and talks with the government.
   The boycott began Monday after a week of street demonstrations
sparked by the April 15 death of former Communist Party chief Hu
Yaobang, an advocate of reform. Tens of thousands of students from
more than a dozen universities have taken part.
   The Communist Party's official People's Daily blamed the unrest
on ``a handful of students with ulterior motives.
   ``This is a planned conspiracy, an upheaval, that in essence
aims at negating the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and
the socialist system,'' the paper said in an editorial broadcast
today on national television and radio.
   The editorial was the strongest warning yet that government
tolerance of the students was nearing an end.
   It said conspirators had used ``the grief of students to
fabricate rumors in an attempt to create greater unrest.
   ``This is a grave political struggle facing the whole party and
the people of all nationalities.''
   It called on the nation to unite against public disturbances and
protect ``hard-earned political stability.''
   The broadcast of the editorial was played repeatedly over
loudspeakers at several major universities.
   ``This is their first step. We can expect arrests to come
soon,'' said one student activist at Beijing University.
   Students and residents of the district where most of the
strike-bound universities are located reported troops from outlying
counties had moved into the area in preparation for an eventual
crackdown.
   Informed sources said more than 10,000 troops had been brought
in.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said late today that government
officials had arranged a meeting with student representatives at
Qinghua University, where most of the more than 10,000 students are
boycottng classes.
   But it said students failed to show up and officials were told
they had been unable to agree on who would represent them.
   The incident appeared to reflect a growing division among
students who want to reduce tensions and those who want to hold
more large-scale marches and rallies. Most students want to
continue the protests in some form until May 4, the 70th
anniversary of China's first pro-democracy student movement.
   ``The divisions are not serious,'' said one student leader. But
poster boards at Beijing University were plastered with pleas for
unity.
   ``If we return to class, we will be condemned by the ages, we
will be the scum of Chinese history,'' said one poster. ``Please
remember ... We are writing history.''
   Students leaders sent activists to street corners to give
speeches explaining their demands for a free press, respect for
human rights and an end to official privileges and corruption.
   Many also are calling for senior leaders such as Premier Li Peng
to resign.
   ``Most workers are sympathetic to the students, but they don't
dare take part,'' said a worker who used his lunch break to go hear
taped speeches by Beijing University students just outside the
campus.
   He said his factory and others were given orders to keep workers
in line, but that the main obstacle was fear of losing their wages.
   ``The students have no responsibilities, but what can I do?'' he
said as he held his small son. ``If I stop working what will my
child eat?''
   The students' condemnation of official corruption has appeal to
many workers because profiteering on the sale of raw materials has
become a major business for many factory officials.
   The students also have won sympathy among journalists, whose
state-controlled publications have been barred from publishing news
of the class boycott.
   Only two newspapers have mentioned the student marches for
democracy, and one, Science and Technology Daily, managed to get
its edition to the streets only after the reporters threatened to
quit en masse.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today outlined
$10 billion in Pentagon budget cuts and said the ``hard choices''
included reductions in dozens of weapons systems and a $1 billion
slash in Star Wars research money.
   Cheney, making his first appearance as defense secretary before
his former colleagues in the House, told the Armed Services
Committee that only the Marine Corps had been spared manpower cuts.
   ``No program was excluded from consideration during the budget
adjustment process,'' Cheney told the House panel at the start of
what was expected to be a day-long hearing.
   ``But my top priorities are quality people, forward strategy,
readiness and sustainability, efficient procurement and strategic
modernization. The adjustments we made to the budget were
implemented within this context.''
   Under the budget agreement reached earlier this spring between
the Bush administration and Congress, the Pentagon is required to
cut future spending plans by $10 billion for the next fiscal year.
   Cheney said that in making the budget changes, ``not only did we
have to make hard choices, but we also had to make sure that they
were the right choices.''
   Funding for Star Wars research has been cut by $1 billion to a
new total of $4.6 billion for fiscal 1990, Cheney said.
   He said the Navy would retire or transfer to the reserves one
aircraft carrier, seven destroyers and 10 frigates, and that the
Air Force would lose its new F-15E ground-attack jet and delay
production of the new B-2 stealth bomber.
   The Army has been told to cancel production of AH-64 Apache
helicopters after fiscal 1991. The Marine Corps has been told to
scrap development of its new V-22 transport aircraft. The Navy has
been ordered to defer some purchases of the F-A-18 jet fighter and
to cancel its planned last purchase of an SSN-688 nuclear attack
submarine.
   Cheney, who took office a month ago, said he had ordered a cut
in active military strength totaling 16,800 positions, down to a
total of 2,121,500. Of those cuts, 8,000 will come from the Army,
5,600 from the Navy, and 3,200 from the Air Force, the defense
chief said.
   A request for a 3.6 percent pay raise in fiscal 1990 for armed
services personnel has been left intact, Cheney said, and training
funds would not be cut.
   On the nuclear-missile question, Cheney said President Bush had
decided to move ahead with two kinds of mobile, strategic missiles
_ the larger, 10-warhead MX missile and the single-warhead
Midgetman.
   Cheney had recommended moving the nation's 50 MX missiles from
silos to deployment on railroad cars rather than developing the
Midgetman. But Bush opted for quick deployment of the MX and
research-and-development funding for the Midgetman.
   ``Further development of the Midgetman wastes funds that are
sorely needed for other defense programs,'' Sen. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said of
the compromise decision.
   But Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on the
House Armed Services Committee, said he had no problem with the
plan. ``The main thing is to preserve and protect the assets we've
got, which is MX in silos, and then go forward and make them
mobile.''
   Congressional Republicans over the years have favored the MX
while many Democrats prefer the Midgetman.
   Warner, a backer of the compromise proposal, said it was his
opinion that the plan ``will move through the Hill reasonably
smoothly,'' because of its bipartisan support.
   The Virginia Republican said the MX-Midgetman plan has the
support of Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, and Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of
the House Armed Services Committee.
   Cheney's recommendation for Star Wars spending of $4.6 billion
compares to a total of $5.9 billion proposed by former President
Reagan. In total, spending for Star Wars, formally known as the
Strategic Defense Initiative, would be $33 billion over five years,
compared to the $40 billion proposed by Reagan.
   ``The Star Wars funding level is keeping pace with the
technology that's moving now in several directions,'' said Sen.
John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
   Dickinson said the spending proposal for Star Wars ``is not
going to be such a cut that it will permanently wreck the program.
It still gives a viable, reasonable program, particularly if they
don't press for early deployment.''
   Cheney said the focus of Star Wars will shift from deployment
sometime in the 1990s to research on ``Brilliant Pebbles,'' a more
advanced system consisting of thousands of orbiting satellites.
   The defense secretary also said the Pentagon would delay work
for one year on the B-2 stealth bomber, which at recent estimates
of $500 million per plane makes it the most expensive aircraft in
history. Original plans called for purchasing 132.
   ``The stretch-out on the B-2 is not that bad in that it was
going to slip some anyway for technical reasons,'' said Dickinson.

<HEAD>Hijacker Blows Himself Up After Failing to Force Plane to Taiwan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A hijacker with explosives strapped to his back
blew himself up after failing to force a domestic Chinese airliner
carrying 50 people to fly to Taiwan, a Chinese news agency reported
today.
   The China News Service said two passengers were injured in the
explosion during Monday's attempted hijacking on a flight from
Ningbo in Zhejiang province to Xiamen in the neighboring eastern
province of Fujian.
   Ningbo is about 490 miles north of Xiamen.
   It said the hijacker, who was carrying a pass from the
journalism department of a university, stabbed an airline hostess
in the hand before charging into the cockpit and demanding to be
flown to Taiwan.
   The pilot fooled the hijacker by flying around before landing in
the city of Fuzhou in Fujian, it added. Fuzhou is 260 miles south
of Mingbo.
   It said the hijacker then blew himself up.
   It said the aircraft, carrying 44 passengers and six crew
members, belonged to the Shanghai Eastern Airlines but gave no
other details about the plane.
   China's last hijacking came in May, when two Chinese used a toy
gun and fake explosives to force a jetliner to fly from Xiamen to
an air base in Taiwan.
   Taiwan gave political asylum to the two and let the plane fly
back to China five hours later. The two hijackers were later
sentenced to 3{ years in prison.

<HEAD>New Contracts Show Further Evidence Of Wage Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracts settled through collective
bargaining in the past three months provided workers average annual
pay raises of 3.1 percent during the life of the pacts, the
government said today.
   The Labor Department report provided additional data suggesting
the rate of wage gains was picking up and placing inflationary
pressures on the economy.
   The 3.1 percent annual increase in wages won in contracts
settled in the first quarter of 1989 contrasted with a 2.5 percent
average for the 12 months ended March 31, indicating wage inflation
has accelerated in the past three months.
   The first-quarter settlements covered 199,000 workers, about 11
percent of the approximately 1.8 million workers whose contracts
were settled through collective bargaining in the past year.
   Although the report showed signs of recent wage acceleration,
the rate of average wage gains during the life of the contracts was
down for both those contracts settled in the past three months and
those settled in the past year.
   The 3.1 percent average annual wage gains negotiated in the
first quarter compared with a 3.5 percent average annual increases
the last time parties to those contracts negotiated, the government
said.
   For 12-month period, the 2.5 percent average annual wage gains
during the life of new contracts compared to 2.7 percent in the
prior contracts.
   Eleven percent of the workers whose contracts were settled in
the past three months have a cost-of-living adjustment included in
the pacts, but those workers generally received lower actual wage
increases to offset expected COLA payments later.
   Workers in non-manufacturing jobs fared better than those in
manufacturing in the first quarter, winning average annual raises
of 3.3 percent compared with 2.3 percent in manufacturing.

<HEAD>Court Upholds law Imposing User Fees on Transporting of Hazardous
Liquids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A unanimous Supreme Court today upheld a 1986
federal law imposing ``safety user fees'' on pipeline companies
that transport natural gas and hazardous liquids.
   The court reversed the ruling of a federal magistrate in
Oklahoma that the law, that allows the secretary of transportation
to impose user fees to pay for pipeline safety programs,
unconstitutionally gives the executive branch too much of Congress'
power to impose taxes.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court that the law
clearly is not an ``unconstitutional delegation of the taxing power
by Congress to the executive branch.''
   The user-fee system is being used to pay for pipeline safety
programs costing about $8.5 million to $9.3 million a year.
   The law had been challenged by Mid-America Pipeline Co., a
transporter of hazardous liquids. It has been assessed a $53,000
fee in 1986 by the secretary of transportation.
   U.S. Magistrate John L. Wagner in Tulsa, Okla., ruled in 1987
that the assessments are taxes, and therefore the law improperly
gives the transportation secretary the power to set tax rates.
   In her opinion today, however, O'Connor said, ``We need not
concern ourselves ...whether the pipeline safety user fees'' are
really taxes.
   Assuming they are, she said, ``We hold that the delegation of
discretionary authority under Congress' taxing power is subject to
no constitutional scrutiny greater than that we have applied to
other non-delegation challenges.''
   Had the court upheld the magistrate's ruling, its decision could
have affected a broad range of federal fees and taxes.
   As examples, government lawyers cited congressional
authorization for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to assess
nuclear power plant operators for licensing and inspection, and for
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose fees to pay the
cost of its various programs.
   The assessments may be based on the amount of pipeline miles a
company operates, the quantity of natural gas or liquid and how far
it is shipped, or the gross revenue of the company.
   The case is Skinner vs. Mid-American Pipeline Co., 87-2098.

<DATELINE>ARCADIA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former fruit picker behind bars for two
decades for the fatal poisoning of his seven children was
railroaded, attorney Mark Lane told a special court hearing today.
   The 21-year-old record of the case was ``skewed by the
prosecutor and the sheriff in this county,'' said Lane, who
represented the former field hand, James Richardson, before Circuit
Judge Clifton Kelly. ``That file comprises the anatomy of a
frame...''
   Lane, a Washington, D.C., lawyer and author who first alleged a
frame-up in the 1971 book ``Arcadia,'' was the first of many
attorneys scheduled to be heard.
   Richardson, wearing a gray suit and dark, horn-rimmed glasses,
was applauded by onlookers when he was brought in to sit at the
defense table.
   ``It is not the purpose of the court to determine innocence or
guilt,'' said Kelly, who was appointed by the state Supreme Court
in March to hear the appeal. ``We are trying to find out whether
there was a fair trial according to law ... but it is impossible to
separate one from the other.''
   The hearing was expected to last all day and possibly into
Wednesday. Kelly previously has indicated he would like to rule
immediately. If that happens, Richardson could be released from
prison promptly. It could be difficult for the state to retry a
21-year-old case.
   For months, the once-hearty fruit picker who is now a graying
53-year-old man has been inching toward freedom with evidence
suggesting he did not poison his children to collect on a life
insurance policy.
   Earlier this month, special prosecutor Janet Reno said the 1968
conviction should be overturned because evidence was withheld and
witnesses lied under oath with the prosecutor's knowledge.
   But the man who put Richardson behind bars sees his possible
release as a miscarriage of justice.
   ``I am just as convinced today of the defendant's guilt as I was
20 years ago,'' said former state attorney Frank Schaub, who is
suing Lane and attorney Ellis Rubin for alleged defamation of
character.
   Defense lawyers claim baby sitter Bessie Reese poisoned the
children while Richardson and his wife, Annie Mae, were working in
citrus groves miles away.
   Reese, who is in her late 60s and is immobile in a nursing home,
has confessed to nurses to the 1967 deaths, according to an
affidavit from nurses. No charges have been filed against her and
prosecutors have said she has become confused.
   In a 200-page document filed with the court, Schaub, 67, called
for the conviction to stand.
   ``To really try to understand how a human being could kill those
innocent, defenseless little children, we must first realize
exactly who and what James Richardson really was, this 32-year-old
man who had more than 10 children,'' Schaub wrote.
   He also listed charges that Richardson refused to support his
children, refused to work regularly, neglected the children,
deserted his first two wives and their children and was arrested
for minor crimes.
   Deputy Attorney General Jim York said Richardson's character is
not the issue.
   ``The question is whether he received a fair trial, and everyone
deserves a fair trial,'' York said.
   Richardson, a black man convicted by an all-white jury in this
southwest Florida farming community, was originally sentenced to
death. That sentence was commuted to life in 1972.
   His lawyers said Richardson was an easy target because he was
illiterate, poor and black. They said prosecutors suppressed
evidence that would have shown Richardson had not yet purchased the
insurance and that a cellmate of Richardson's has recanted
statements that he heard Richardson confess.
   Richardson was transferred Sunday from the Tomoka Correctional
Institution in Daytona Beach to the county jail in Arcadia so he
can attend the hearing.
   If freed, Lane said Richardson would visit the graves of his
children then return to Daytona Beach for a shrimp dinner.
   Rubin said he has found a job and housing in Miami for
Richardson, who has learned recently about contemporary technology
such as television remote controls and telephone answering machines.
   ``I won't believe it until I am free,'' he said in a recent
interview at the prison. ``I've been promised freedom too many
times before.''

<HEAD>Government Announces New Security At British Airports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon has announced
improved airport security measures following the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103.
   He told Parliament on Monday the measures include examination of
radios and computers and planned use of a thermal neutron analysis
machine for bomb detection at Heathrow and Gatwick airports. More
airport security inspectors would be employed and the government
would give more money for research into detecting explosives.
   Channon said he would discuss the thermal neutron analysis
machine being developed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority in
talks this week with U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner.
   British press reports say the machines cost $850,000 each.
   Channon said under the new measures, all hold baggage on high
risk flights is being screened and aircraft design changes are
being carried out to make it more difficult to hide arms or
explosives.
   ``This package represents a concerted effort to tighten up
security. The aim is to give passengers and air crew a high level
of security,'' Channon told reporters later.
   New York-bound Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, on
Dec. 21, 1988, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground.
The flight originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, changing planes
at Heathrow. Investigators say a bomb in a portable radio in the
hold destroyed the plane.

<HEAD>Knight-Ridder Exec Says Industry Needs To Take Advantage of Technology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers should take advantage of technology to
stay close to their readers, Knight-Ridder Inc. President James K.
Batten told publishers gathered today for the American Newspaper
Publishers Association convention.
   Batten, chief executive officer of Miami-based Knight-Ridder,
said, ``If newspapers are going to be as successful in the future
as they've been in the past, we have to be much more zealous about
getting close to our customers and staying there. Technology can
help us do that.
   ``Used intelligently, the telephone and the computer can let us
recreate the kind of personal relationships that newspapers had
with their customers 20 or 25 years ago.''
   For example, he said, the Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin
uses a voice service to offer telephone recordings of soap opera
updates, publishing a daily access code for readers to call. The
Journal reported more than 20,000 calls a month. In Colorado, the
Boulder Daily Camera gets more than 77,000 calls a month on a
system that offers recordings of sports scores and stories.
   The call-in systems are relatively inexpensive, requiring little
more than a personal computer, phone lines and tape recordings,
Batten said during a session on the convention's second day. It
ends Wednesday.
   In addition, the industry has little choice but to change in
dealing with the aging of the baby-boom generation, an increase in
two-income households and the growing cultural diversity of the
U.S. population, he said.
   ``These are threats, not to our existence but to our pricing
flexibility, to our ability to finance the news coverage that our
communities deserve and that we want to provide,'' Batten said.
   ``We can respond to those threats ... we can do that by using
technology to take some modest steps that will bring us closer to
the customer who keeps our business going _ the reader.''

   Teen-agers accused of beating and raping a
jogger joked about the assault when first jailed, but now some of
them reportedly have been angrily taunted by fellow inmates at a
juvenile center.
   A grand jury has begun hearing evidence against eight
teen-agers, age 14 to 17, charged with beating and raping a
28-year-old woman, an investment banker who remains in a coma.
   ``It could have been my mother. It could have been my sister,''
a counselor at Spofford Juvenile Center in the Bronx quoted
residents as yelling at one of the accused youths, The New York
Post reported today.
   Officials said the suspects were no longer laughing and joking.
``They're really, really quiet and scared,'' the newspaper quoted
another Spofford worker as saying.
   The victim was attacked the night of April 19 while she ran
alone on an isolated stretch of road in Central Park. She was
unconscious for about four hours before passersby spotted her.
   Doctors say she probably will live but they are worried about
brain damage that may have occurred while she lay unconscious for
four hours.

   Investigators are trying to determine if there
was any connection between the crash of a student pilot coming in
for a landing and the almost simultaneous clearing for takeoff of a
plane carrying Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner.
   Carol Ann Reiser, 33, of suburban Itasca, was killed April 15 at
Du Page County Airport, west of Chicago. Her single-engine Cessna
152 plunged to the ground about 580 feet short of the runway as she
was practicing landings.
   Skinner's plane, a government Beechcraft King Air 90, was
cleared for takeoff at the same time on the same runway, officials
revealed Monday.
   The same controller, who was in training, gave the clearances to
both aircraft, said Michael Benson, a spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board, which is conducting the investigation.
   ``Our preliminary reading of the air-traffic control tapes is
that the messages to both planes were virtually simultaneous,'' he
said.
   Investigators are trying to learn if the back-to-back orders
were an error that contributed to the Cessna crash, or if the pilot
simply lost control of her airplane.
   Investigators have reported no evidence of mechanical failure of
the Cessna.
   Officials said witnesses have provided conflicting reports on
the position of Skinner's plane when the Cessna went down.
   Some say Skinner's aircraft was in a holding position waiting to
take off. Others say it was already airborne.
   Skinner, who had visited Chicago for press interviews and to
attend the baseball home opener of the White Sox, was heading for a
meeting in St. Louis at the time of the accident.

capital</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee is considering a
proposal from its chairman that would force savings and loan owners
to back their lending with more of their own capital.
   According to a draft document circulated among committee members
and obtained Monday by The Associated Press, Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, is offering a plan with moderately stricter
capital requirements than the bill passed earlier this month by the
subcommittee on financial institutions, chaired by Rep. Frank
Annunzio, D-Ill.
   Gonzalez' committee is scheduled to hold its first public
session on the bill Wednesday, after a private meeting of committee
Democrats today.
   Both Gonzalez' plan and the subcommittee's bill include a
risk-based formula for capital that offers a break to S&amp;Ls making
low-risk loans such as home mortgages.
   But the Gonzalez proposal would require most S&amp;Ls to maintain a
somewhat higher base of ``tangible'' or ``real money'' capital,
which includes cash and assets readily convertible to cash.
   The subcommittee's bill provides for a base of tangible capital
of $1.50 for every $100 in loans, while another $1.50 could consist
of ``goodwill,'' an intangible asset representing the value of an
institution's customer loyalty and name recognition. Together, they
amount to ``core'' capital of 3 percent.
   Gonzalez' plan also provides for core capital of 3 percent, but
it's tougher on goodwill, allowing it make up only one fourth,
rather than one half, of the core.
   Both the Gonzalez and subcommittee legislation represent
advances over current rules, which do not require owners to put up
any real money if they have enough goodwill and subordinated debt _
money S&amp;Ls borrow _ on their books.
   As of the end of 1988, goodwill was the biggest loophole,
accounting for a third of the industry's $60 billion in capital.
Subordinated debt amounts to about $4 billion.
   S&amp;L industry critics are targeting goodwill because it cannot be
sold when an institution closes.
   The subcommittee bill would allow S&amp;Ls to maintain goodwill on
their books, in some cases for as long as 40 years. Gonzalez would
eliminate it in 20 years. The Bush administration had wanted to get
rid of it in 10 years.
   The Gonzalez' plan is also stricter with risky activities
conducted in S&amp;L subsidiaries, such as investment in commercial
real estate and junk bonds. It gives S&amp;Ls five years to come up
with extra capital to back the subsidiaries, while the subcommittee
plan doesn't require extra capital.
   In another change, Gonzalez would move back the deadline for
complying with the new capital rules, from the June 1, 1990, target
in the subcommittee bill to the June 1, 1991, originally proposed
by President Bush.
   Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, one of the top-ranking Republicans on
the House Banking Committee, is pressing for even stricter capital
requirements, calling the 1.5 percent tangible rule ``absolutely
utterly insane.''
   ``We have made a prescription for repetition of the problem and
I think the country ought to be alarmed,'' Leach told a National
Press Club forum.
   The Senate voted 91-8 to approve its version of S&amp;L legislation
last week.
   Bush, praising the vote in a speech in Chicago to the annual
meeting of The Associated Press, said, ``I urge the House to act
promptly, and pass this S&amp;L reform bill with its central provisions
intact.''

<HEAD>Treatment Could Revolutionize Organ Transplants</HEAD>

   A treatment that could revolutionize
organ transplants by overcoming the rejection of foreign tissue and
improving the quality of patients' lives is showing promising
results, researchers say.
   The treatment, which could eliminate the lifelong need for
highly toxic drugs to fight organ rejection by the body's immune
system, may be ready for human studies within three years, said Dr.
C. Garrison Fathman, Stanford University professor of medicine.
   The approach uses three doses of tailor-made, laboratory-grown
monoclonal antibodies before the transplant to temporarily
``blind'' the immune system and keep it from recognizing the new
organ as foreign tissue and attacking it.
   Rats given the treatment before receiving transplanted hearts
have survived for more than 200 days without signs of rejection and
without any anti-rejection drugs.
   Dr. Thomas Flavin, of the Stanford department of cardiovascular
surgery, was scheduled to present the findings today at the
International Society for Heart Transplantation meeting in Munich,
West Germany.
   Meanwhile, the first full year of mandatory reporting of organ
transplants by U.S. hospitals shows 12,798 of the procedures were
performed around the country in 1988, according to the national
transplant network.
   The statistics, released Monday, were compiled by the United
Network for Organ Sharing. Medical centers have been required since
Oct. 1, 1987, by federal law to report transplants to the
Virginia-based network.
   There were 9,123 kidney transplants, according to the network
data. There also were 1,680 liver transplants, 1,647 heart
transplants, 243 pancreas transplants, 74 heart-lung transplants
and 31 lung transplants. Twenty-one of the lung transplants
involved a full set of lungs and 10 involved single lungs.
   The monoclonal antibody treatment effectively paralyzed the rat
immune system by killing certain cells while surgeons implanted
hearts from donor rats into the abdomens of other rats with
mismatched tissue type, leaving the recipients' original hearts
intact.
   The drugs a patient must take to prevent the immune system from
attacking a transplanted organ also prevent the immune system from
attacking other harmful diseases. Patients then are susceptible to
infections and may suffer other problems related to the drugs'
toxicity.
   The antibody treatment takes a new approach to the problem by
creating a ``transient window of immunosuppression,'' said
co-research, Dr. Judith Shizuru.
   The antibody wipes out the specific type of white blood cells,
called CD4 T lymphocytes, that lead the attack on the foreign
organ, she said. But only mature cells are killed. Immature T cells
are protected inside the thymus gland and begin repopulating in the
body a few weeks after the transplant.
   ``We're sort of fooling the immune system for awhile,'' Fathman
said.
   ``We're wiping the blackboard clean by removing the (mature) T
cells that have not yet come into contact with the foreign antigen,
in this instance the transplant,'' he said.
   By transplanting the new organ at a time when those cells are
absent, the T cells repopulating from the immature cells in the
thymus apparently do not recognize the transplant as anything
except ``self,'' he said.
   When the T cells grew back, the immune system appeared to be
``blind'' to the foreign transplanted organ. But the T cells
maintained their ``memory'' and attacked other foreign tissue.
   ``If the same thing holds in man, and we can prove that
immunologic memory is not impaired by this type of immune
paralysis, then we would be very hopeful that this technique could
be readily applied to man,'' Fathman said.

   Hundreds of teachers staged a one-day
strike today against the San Jose Unified School District, which
has 29,000 students in 40 schools.
   The main reason for the strike was that the district ``has
refused to return to the bargaining table,'' said Brian McKenna,
executive director of the 1,569-member San Jose Teachers
Association.
   The last talks were held in September and union members voted
March 17 to authorize a strike. About 285 teachers held a wildcat
``sickout'' on March 10.
   Schools superintendent Hilda Beck said she was calling in
substitute teachers.
   The teachers want a 7 percent pay increase, along with
improvements in fringe benefits and working conditions, and the
district offered a 4.32 percent pay hike.

   President Bush today declared a federal
disaster in Texas, where thunderstorms and flooding destroyed
property in late March.
   Bush's declaration frees federal funds for such assistance as
temporary housing and grants and low-interest loans for individuals
and businesses hard hit by the storms in the western part of the
state.
   The federal aid also will go to local governments to repair
public facilities, paying up to 75 percent of the cost.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency will make the assistance
available to the Texas counties of Cass, Cherokee, Gregg, Harrison,
Marion and Rusk, with coordination of the efforts centered in
Denton.
   The White House announced the declaration in Washington and in
San Jose, Calif., where Bush was traveling.

   By her count, Dr. Ruth Barnett performed
40,000 abortions over a half-century, all during a time when the
practice was illegal.
   Police raided her clinic again and again. She served two terms
in the county jail, one term in the state prison, but insisted
always, ``I never really broke the law.''
   She died in 1969, never living to see the U.S. Supreme Court's
Roe vs. Wade decision, which changed the law to give women a
constitutional right to an abortion.
   Now, the high court is considering a Missouri case that could
change the landmark abortion ruling. On the eve of Wednesday's
opening arguments in the case, people who knew Barnett remembered
the doctor and her crusade.
   To some, she was ``Ruthless Ruth.'' To others, especially her
patients, she was an angel of mercy.
   At age 16, Barnett became pregnant and had an abortion. In her
1969 book, ``They Weep At My Doorstep,'' she told about breaking
the news of the pregnancy to her boyfriend.
   ``He was sympathetic at first, then resentful. He was not to
blame, he said ...`You got yourself that way, now get yourself out
of it.'''
   The experience persuaded her to learn a method practiced by one
of the first female surgeons in the Northwest, Dr. Alys Bixby
Griff. Barnett was trained to perform abortions, and in 1932 she
was certified as a doctor of naturopathy.
   She developed her code of ethics: Every woman had the right to
choose a safe, sanitary abortion over an unwanted pregnancy.
   ``Helen'' was 18 when she went to see Barnett in 1946. Today,
she's a grandmother.
   ``I wonder in God's name what would have happened to me without
Dr. Barnett. I was so determined,'' said the woman, who spoke on
condition that her real name not be revealed.
   She learned of Barnett through a girlfriend. Her boyfriend gave
her $400 for the abortion.
   ``Never at any time was I ambivalent,'' she said. ``It was no
choice, not pro-choice. ... It was a sobering event, I didn't take
it lightly. To me, it was immoral to get married because you were
pregnant.''
   Helen married her boyfriend and together had two children,
``both welcome, both planned,'' she said.
   Barnett's practice flourished during the Depression and through
World War II, when many women joined the workforce.
   But in the 1950s, police began to crack down on Portland's
abortion clinics.
   Police were helped by The Oregon Journal's ace investigative
reporter Rolla J. Crick.
   Crick said in an interview that in 1951 he and a policewoman
posing as his pregnant girlfriend made the rounds of the clinics.
They gave their findings to the district attorney.
   On July 6, Crick's byline appeared under a banner headline,
``POLICE CRACK DOWN ON ABORTION NESTS.''
   Crick told how police ``thundered at the doors of half a dozen
suspected abortion mills in simultaneous raids.'' Partially clad
women ran screaming from the premises as suspected abortionists
were hauled into jail.
   Six people, including Barnett, were charged with manslaughter of
fetuses by abortion and maintaining a public nuisance as a result
of the raids.
   There were no figures on the number of women injured or killed
by illegal abortions, Crick said.
   ``There were some deaths, but not wholesale deaths,'' he said.
   ``Some women said they wished they hadn't (had abortions).
Others said, `Hey look, it's nobody's business,''' he said.
   ``A lot of women were ending up unable to have children because
of botched abortions. It was protecting women against themselves,''
he said of the raids.
   He said he remembered that Barnett ran a clean operation and her
work was respected by the medical community. Barnett herself
claimed 70 percent of her patients were referred by doctors.
   Barnett was flamboyant, often dressing like a showgirl in furs
and fancy jewels. Detractors claimed Barnett performed abortions
for the money. But others said she performed many abortions for
free.
   During her career, she made $9 million, but with her resources
exhausted by high living and legal fees, she died at age 77 with
less than $15,000.
   Only when she was dying of cancer in the Oregon Women's
Correctional Center did she agree not to perform another abortion.

   A man in southern India said Tuesday a
mango tree in his garden has borne a fruit with an Islamic
inscription on its skin, and crowds were flocking to the site, news
reports said.
   Haji Mohammad Multani said the inscription on the unripe mango
was in Arabic and read ``La Ilaha Illallah'' _ ``There no God but
Allah,'' according to Press Trust of India.
   The news agency said Multani spotted the freak mango a month ago
on the two-year-old tree in the garden of his house in Hyderabad,
745 miles south of New Delhi.
   The inscription has grown with the fruit, a Hyderabad-based
journalist said by telephone, quoting Multani.
   The unusual fruit, one among the three borne by the tree, was
attracting large crowds of curious people.
   This was the first time the tree had borne fruit, Multani said.
The other two mangos were normal, he said.
   After the fruit is ripe, Multani said he might give it to a
museum.

<HEAD>NAACP Opposing Likely Justice Civil Rights Nominee</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs of Thornburgh reax after 5th graf, Lucas had</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush today announced his intention
to nominate William Lucas, a black Republican critic of affirmative
action, as the Justice Department's civil rights chief, setting up
a potentially bruising Senate confirmation fight.
   The previously announced opposition to Lucas by the NAACP, the
nation's largest civil rights group, could energize liberal
opposition to the nominee.
   Benjamim Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, said in a statement Monday
that Lucas is not qualified to be the government's chief enforcer
of civil rights laws.
   The White House formally announced Lucas' selection as assistant
attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's civil rights
division in a one-sentence statement issued in San Jose, Calif.,
where Bush had spent the night.
   Lucas had been pushed for the job by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh.
   In a statement, Thornburgh called Lucas ``a talented, decent and
compassionate person whom I have known for a number of years.''
   ``Bill Lucas is fully committed to the vigorous and fair
enforcement of our country's civil rights laws and to removing
barriers to equal opportunity for all our citizens,'' Thornburgh
said.
   ``There are many positions for which Mr. Lucas is eminently
qualified in this administration,'' Hooks said. But the civil
rights job ``is one of the most sensitive positions in government,
as it relates to minorities, and we do not believe Mr. Lucas is the
person for this post.''
   Hooks said the NAACP ``feels duty-bound to strive for the best
qualified appointee for this most important position.''
   People for the American Way, a well-financed liberal lobbying
group, also expressed reservations about Lucas.
   Lucas ``is someone with no track records and a lot of question
marks,'' the group's president, Arthur J. Kropp, said.
   ``The questions will have to be resolved before the civil rights
community can support him,'' said Kropp, who heads a 270,000-member
organization that helped defeat Robert Bork's nomination to the
Supreme Court in 1987.
   Hooks said Lucas lacks expertise to be the Justice Department's
civil rights chief.
   ``Each and every day this official must make crucial decisions
of a highly technical and critical nature that demand specialized
knowledge, based upon experience and background in this area,''
Hooks said.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said the
NAACP's announcement ``doesn't change a thing for us.''
   ``We're just disappointed that they chose to ignore not only his
more than 35 years of public service but also his commitment to
enforcing the civil rights laws of the country,'' she said.
   Thornburgh's ``support for Bill Lucas has been unwavering since
the announcement of his recommendation to the president.'' She said
Thornburgh's ``friendship and admiration for Bill Lucas spans a
number of years.''
   Lucas has been criticized by some civil rights leaders since
Thornburgh revealed in February that he had urged Bush to nominate
him for the position. The NAACP chapter in Lucas' hometown of
Detroit voted recently to oppose Lucas, though the city's Urban
League group decided not to oppose the nomination.
   The 61-year-old Lucas, a former sheriff and executive of Wayne
County, ran unsuccessfully as the GOP's nominee for Michigan
governor in 1986. A former Democrat, Lucas has been considered for
other federal positions in the Bush administration.
   Civil rights leaders have cited Lucas' record as sheriff to
demonstrate their view that he is not qualified to run a Justice
Department division responsible for prosecuting local police for
brutality.
   In 1976, Lucas was held legally responsible by a federal appeals
court for failure to investigate allegations that a prisoner was
beaten while in the custody of sheriff's deputies. Lucas says he
was unaware of the allegations at the time, but the court found he
had failed to institute training procedures to prevent brutality by
his deputies.
   That same year, Lucas was cited for contempt of court for
failing to reduce overcrowding and improve conditions at the county
jail.
   Lucas' claim on an old resume that he served as an assistant
U.S. attorney in the Justice Department's civil rights division
during the early 1960s also has sparked controversy.
   Lucas actually worked as a legal assistant and resigned after he
failed the District of Columbia bar examination.
   Criticism of Lucas has been by no means universal among black
civil rights leaders. The Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, president of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, sent a letter to
Thornburgh praising Lucas' selection and recently Atlanta Mayor
Andrew Young expressed support for the choice.
   In addition, Rep. John Conyers, a black Democrat from Detroit,
also expressed support for Lucas. Conyers is a senior member of the
House Judiciary Committee.

   A House panel called today for the impeachment
of imprisoned U.S. District Judge Walter Nixon of Mississippi, who
has collected $286,000 in pay since his 1986 perjury trial and is
planning to return to the bench within months.
   ``His pattern of lies and deceit led ... to the inevitable
conclusion that he has to be impeached,'' Rep. Don Edwards,
D-Calif., said as the House Judiciary Committee approved three
articles of impeachment, 34-0.
   Floor action by the full House on the move to impeach the
Mississippi jurist could come as early as Wednesday.
   Nixon stands accused of lying to a federal grand jury and
Justice Department investigators and bringing the judiciary into
disrepute.
   The case centers on an oil and gas investment arranged for Nixon
by a wealthy businessman, Wylie Fairchild, and Nixon's alleged
intervention in marijuana smuggling charges against Fairchild's son.
   Nixon was sentenced in 1986 to two concurrent five-year
sentences for perjury after denying involvement in the marijuana
case. Since then, he has collected $286,000 in judicial salary,
authorities say. They say he will be released within a matter of
months and plans to don his black robes again and resume his seat
on the bench.
   ``I believe that Judge Nixon should have had the good grace to
resign after his appeals were exhausted,'' Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., told the Judiciary Committee.
   Defense attorney David Stewart had said that some of the
statements cited as instances of perjury were factual, and that in
any case Nixon has done nothing serious enough to warrant
impeachment. He said Nixon was ``subjected to a sensationalized
investigation and an unfair trial.''
   In such cases, the House first votes on a bill of impeachment.
If it approves the bill, the judge is impeached and must stand
trial in the Senate.
   The Senate is currently preparing for a trial of U.S. District
Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami, who was impeached last year.

   A 500-mile road race got under way before dawn
Tuesday to honor those killed aboard Pan Am Flight 103 and to draw
attention to a campaign for a U.S. congressional inquiry into the
disaster.
   The race by four marathon runners, to be held in stages between
London and the Scottish village of Lockerbie, began outside the
Houses of Parliament and is due to end Sunday.
   A bomb blew apart the New York-bound Pan Am jumbo jet over
Scotland on Dec. 21, killing 270 people.
   Organizers said the race is being held in memory of the victims
and to focus attention on their relatives' campaign for a
congressional inquiry and for improved security at airports.
   Two U.S. runners, French-born circus clown Yves Pol, 35, and Tom
Grace, 48, of New York, are competing against Malcolm Campbell, 55,
of Scotland, and Eleanor Adams, 41, of Britain.
   They ran 26 miles Tuesday to Hemel Hempstead northwest of
London, then set out from nearby Leighton Buzzard for Oakham 62
miles away in central England.
   On Saturday, they will race around Glasgow's Ibrox Stadium
during the halftime break in a soccer game between Glasgow Rangers
and Heart of Midlothian.
   They will be joined on the last five-miles to Lockerbie in
southwestern Scotland by Eleanor Bright, 32, whose husband died in
the crash. Nicholas Bright, also 32, had been returning to his
Brookline, Mass., home from a business trip to London.

<TEXT>
   Even before Pennsylvania's Super 7
lottery jackpot hit $100 million today, the frenzy over a North
American record was getting to be a little too much for some state
residents.
   It's not the money they mind. It's the out-of-staters.
   ``Go home, Marylanders!'' one man shouted out his car window
Monday evening as he drove by the Case &amp; Keg in Shrewsbury, just
across the border from Maryland, where about 200 people waited in
line to buy $1 tickets.
   Would-be millionaires from Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C.,
Ohio, Kansas, New York and California joined the queues at the beer
distributorship, and at another store in Shrewsbury.
   The scene was repeated across the state as long lines and
traffic jams formed around ticket outlets ahead of Wednesday's
drawing.
   At Philadelphia International Airport, the ticket line was 30
deep at lunchtime.
   TWA pilot Bob Link flew from his home in Columbus, Ohio, to
Greater Pittsburgh International Airport to buy $25 worth of
tickets for himself and $86 for friends and relatives.
   ``Seventy million dollars gets your attention real quick,'' he
said, referring to an earlier estimate of the jackpot, ``and $83
million gets your attention even quicker.''
   The jackpot began reaching record proportions after six straight
drawings yielded no winning ticket. Last week's jackpot was for $46
million. Unclaimed, it grew to $62 million on Thursday and $70
million by the weekend.
   On Monday, lottery officials announced the drawing would be
worth at least $83 million, based on ticket sales. Lottery
spokesman Terry Murphy said today that the jackpot had risen to
$100 million.
   There was even an international flavor to the ticket-buying
spree.
   Bill Thwaites of Toronto, who was en route to Virginia, stopped
for tickets in Shrewsbury after hearing of the jackpot from friends
who live near Reading.
   ``It's been on the radio and TV up in Toronto, but I didn't know
the jackpot was this large,'' Thwaites said. ``I'm just buying a
few tickets, nothing extravagant.''
   Susan and Hans Lienhards, who recently returned from nine years
in Europe, took time off from house shopping to buy tickets.
   ``This is like a carnival, and people are having fun, talking
about what they would do with the money,'' Mrs. Lienhards said.
   The world's richest lottery jackpot was Spain's El Gordo, or
``the fat one,'' last December. The $159 million first prize was
split by hundreds of people.
   The largest U.S. jackpot to date was an Illinois prize of $69.9
million that was split by four players nearly two weeks ago. The
largest single U.S. lottery payout was $55.16 million won by a
Florida woman in her state's drawing in September.
   Super 7 players pick seven numbers out of a possible 80, having
a 1 in 9.6 million chance of selecting a winning ticket.

   Authorities have arrested 30 leading
opposition party members for anti-government activities, sources
said Tuesday.
   Those arrested, mostly students and youth activists, belonged to
the National League For Democracy, the sources said on condition of
anonymity.
   They were arrested after chanting anti-government slogans and
staging anti-government plays during the Burmese new year
festivities that ended April 17, the sources said. They did not say
when the arrests were made.
   Schools are to reopen in June after being closed for a year
following student unrest for democracy. In September, the armed
forces commander, Gen. Saw Maung, took power in a coup and his
troops killed hundreds of people demonstrating for democracy.
   After the schools were closed in June 1988, many students joined
one of the dozen minority groups such as the mainly Christian Karen
guerrillas, who seek greater autonomy from the Buddhist central
government.

   A woman suspected of being a witch was
dragged from her hut, tied to a tree and then axed to death by her
neighbors in an eastern India village, police said Tuesday.
   Sonamoni Kisku was killed Sunday by Ganesh Soren and his
brother, Meghraj, in Goaljoi, about 155 miles northwest of
Calcutta, police said.
   Ganesh Soren was arrested but his brother was at large,
according to Police Chief Satyan Pal.
   It was the latest in several killings of women suspected of
being witches in the predominantly tribal region of the state. The
Santhal tribes believe many women, especially widows, have the
power to heal the sick and cast evil spells.
   But Mrs. Kisku, 50, was married and had two sons, Pal said.
   He said Ganesh Soren believed Mrs. Kisku had cast an evil spell
on his 6-year-old daughter, who had been ill since January.
   State Chief Minister Jyoti Basu said at least 20 women were
killed in West Bengal in 1987 on suspicion of practicing witchcraft.

   A Soviet seaman who jumped ship into
near-freezing water off the Danish coast was rescued and placed in
a refugee camp, the naval command headquarters said Tuesday.
   The 26-year-old sailor donned a life-vest and jumped overboard
Saturday from a Soviet civilian vessel heading north through the
Great Belt strait on its way to the North Sea, the command said.
   A passing Danish navy ship spotted the seaman and picked him up.
He was turned over to police at the port of Korsoer, where he asked
for political asylum.
   The man, who was not identified, was lodged in a refugee center
to await a decision, the navy said.

   Immigration officials were waiting today for
a break in bad weather to fly two asylum-seeking Soviets to
Anchorage from a Bering Strait island where they defected.
   The two sought political asylum on the island of Little Diomede
on Sunday, hours before officials signed a protocol aimed at easing
travel restrictions between Alaska and Siberia, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service said.
   INS officials in Nome gave the Soviets permission to stay on the
island, and they spent the night in a National Guard Armory there.
   The defectors were being kept under tight security, Jim
Stimpfle, a Nome Chamber of Commerce official who reached the
island before the weather turned bad, said today. ``Everything is
hush-hush. They've even got the armory windows blacked out with
ponchos or something.''
   Soviet officials are aware of the defections, but ``at this
point we have no comment,'' said Andre Dronov, a Soviet vice consul
in San Francisco.
   The men were reported missing when the Soviet delegation
prepared to leave the island by helicopter after a party following
the signing ceremony.
   INS District Director Gary Johnson said they were the first
Soviet defectors in his 10 years with the agency in Alaska. Their
asylum requests will go to the State Department for review before
the INS makes a decision.
   The Soviet delegation came to Little Diomede to sign the
protocol, which urged the U.S. and Soviet governments to approve a
border commission to handle visits by Eskimos between Alaska and
Siberia. Eskimos would not need visas to make the trip.
   Gov. Steve Cowper was supposed to take part in the ceremony
along with his counterpart from the Magadan region of Siberia. Fog
and blowing snow prevented Cowper from reaching the island, and the
ceremony was conducted by telephone.
   The ceremony was held in conjunction with the Bering Bridge
Expedition, a skiing and sled dog journey from Siberia to Alaska.
The expedition consists of six Soviets and six Americans. Two of
the Soviets and two of the Americans are Eskimos.
   Many Eskimo families were separated when the Soviets closed the
border in the Bering Strait at the onset of the Cold War in the
late 1940s.
   The Soviet island of Big Diomede, three miles from Little
Diomede, is a military installation. Eskimos who once lived there
were relocated to the Siberian mainland in the 1950s.

   Anti-poaching officers in
southern Tanzania seized 127 elephant tusks worth $19,000 and
arrested four people, a news agency reported.
   The tusks were seized near Tanzania's southern border with
Mozambique while en route to the central Tanzanian town of Iringa,
west of the port city Dar es Salaam, according to the report Monday
by the state-run Shihata news agency. Shihata did not say when the
ivory was seized.
   Police said two suspects eluded capture.
   Tanzania banned trade in ivory in 1986, but poaching continues.
In the last 15 years, hunters, lured by ivory's soaring world
price, have reduced Tanzania's elephants by about one-third to an
estimated 100,000.
   Western wildlife officials say ethnic Somali tribespeople, or
Shiftas, hired by private businessmen and corrupt government
officials, are largely responsible for the slaughter of East
Africa's once flourishing elephant herds.

<TEXT>
   From prisons and re-education camps in Vietnam,
Nguyen Chi Thien wrote of despair, of loved ones and of dreams of
freedom.
   Through poetry, he found a way to let his thoughts escape from
``the swamplands'' where he spent nearly half his life.
   Human rights groups have conflicting reports on Thien's fate,
with some sources saying he died in jail and others suggesting he
remains imprisoned. His plight has drawn attention of writers
around the world, and now his works are part of an effort to
highlight the risks writers take to express themselves.
   On Wednesday, a U.S. chapter of the PEN organization, a leading
voice of international literary freedom, will honor Thien with one
of two Freedom-to-Write awards.
   The other writer to be honored at the PEN American Center
Montblanc Literary Gala is identified only as ``an anonymous
African woman.''
   ``The very thought that that person is unable to be identified
says so much about the importance of focusing attention on these
writers,'' said author John Irving, a member of PEN American Center.
   ``We can't even say which country in Africa she is from because
of the dangers she faces. That underlines the need for us to turn
to these heroic people as symbols in the fight against the harsh
treatment of writers in countries where people are a lot less free
to write.''
   In addition to $3,000 that the PEN American Center will send to
a friend or relative of each recipient, the group hopes to pressure
Vietnam with a written request for Thien's release and pleas from
prominent writers.
   Irving said freedom of expression is not just important to
writers:
   ``In a world where we have writers who are not free, who are
imprisoned and tortured for writing, what happens to the readers in
these societies?''
   He said promoting freedom of expression is especially important
this year because of the controversy over Salman Rushdie's novel,
``The Satanic Verses.'' The book, considered blasphemous by many
Moslems, ignited an international furor and led to calls for
censorship and for Rushdie's death.
   For Thien, imprisoned for 26 of his 55 years after opposing the
Communist government, pushing for literary freedoms and writing
articles critical of communism, poetry became a creative diversion
to help him survive prison hardships and the emotional torment of
captivity.
   According to reports from human rights groups, Thien burst into
the British Embassy in Hanoi in April 1979. He gave a staff member
a collection of poems and a letter asking that they be published.
Vietnamese guards arrested him.
   His poems have been translated into French and English, set to
music and compiled in a book titled ``Flowers From Hell,'' which
won the prestigious Rotterdam International Poetry Prize in 1985.
   ``When successful, it sounds like the depth of feelings from a
man who has endured much pain but continued to dream and to hope
for freedom,'' said Huynh Sanh Thong, who translated the poems into
English. Thong is director of Vietnamese Studies Projects at Yale
University, where the book was published.
   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International
received reports that Thien had died in 1986. But sources in
Southeast Asia have told Amnesty International since then that he
is alive. There also have been reports that he is suffering from
depression and is partially paralyzed.

   Hungry elephants broke out of a game
reserve in search of food and killed four peasant squatters who
were tending crops, news reports said Tuesday.
   Families from the minority Tonga tribe recently settled and
planted crops on the edges of the Chirisa game reserve in the
Midlands, said Claudius Hove, the Department of National Parks and
Wildlife's chief warden in the province.
   In past weeks, they beat tribal drums to keep stray elephants
from their plots. Instead, the drumbeats attracted the animals,
Hove told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency.
   ``These people have been settling in and around the game park
and the elephants have been increasingly attracted by crops in
their fields,'' Hove said.
   The settlers will be moved from the reserve and game rangers
will try to drive the stray elephants back into the park, he said.
If the animals don't budge, they will be shot, he added.

   Federal officials today opened a hearing aimed at
explaining how a cargo door was torn off a United Airlines jumbo
jet in February, killing nine passengers.
   National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Lee Dickinson
began the four-day hearing with a statement that the testimony
gathered would assist the NTSB in ``determining the probable cause
and in making any recommendations to prevent similar accidents.''
   But he said any conclusions would await a report issued later in
Washington, D.C.
   The Boeing 747's 800-pound, 9-foot-square forward lower cargo
hatch was left at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean after United
Flight 811 lost part of its fuselage shortly after takeoff from
Honolulu.
   The door was located 85 miles southwest of Honolulu and under
nearly 17,000 feet of water.
   Dickinson has said efforts may be made to raise the door, which
several experts say is the best chance of finding definitive
answers for the cause of the accident.
   Investigators are debating whether a Navy salvage mission this
summer would be essential and worth the high cost.
   Officials for United, the Boeing Co., the Federal Aviation
Administration, and unions representing airline pilots and
mechanics were expected to testify during the hearing.
   ``The board's full report will not be issued for several months,
but recommendations to prevent any recurrence could come at any
time,'' Dickinson said in a news release.
   The plane was bound for Sydney, Australia, with 337 passengers
and a crew of 18 on Feb. 24. At about 23,000 feet, the airplane
experienced an explosive decompression following the loss of the
cargo door.
   Nine people were sucked out, along with seats and luggage, when
the door and part of the aircraft fuselage were swept away.
   Though two engines conked out, pilot David Cronin managed to
land at Honolulu with no further loss of life.
   The 747-100 was one of the first jumbo jets built by
Seattle-based Boeing.
   The 13 people testifying were expected to discuss maintenance,
inspection procedures and practices, human factors and details of a
1987 incident in which the cargo door on a Pan Am 747 opened
slightly during a flight from London.
   There has been speculation the United cargo door may have broken
free in an explosive decompression when the latching mechanism
failed. Airline records indicated there had been recent problems
with the door before the accident, including a faulty door seal and
electrical problems requiring the door to be closed manually rather
than electrically on several occasions.
   The FAA on March 3 issued an emergency order requiring all U.S.
airlines to reinforce within 30 days the relatively lightweight
aluminum latch mechanisms with steel, so the doors would be less
vulnerable to damage caused by improper closing.
   The cargo bay door is hinged at the top so it closes downward,
with eight latching mechanisms along the bottom attached to the
plane's frame. It also has a latching mechanism and a hook pin on
each side.
   The United 747 remains at Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu and
will be returned to service after repairs are completed.

<TEXT>
   The Postal Inspection Service is trying to
help America stamp out drugs by sending gun-toting inspectors to
deliver arrest warrants along with drug-filled mail.
   ``In fiscal 1988, we arrested 425 people for distributing
narcotics through the mail,'' inspector Tom McClure said. ``In the
first six months of this fiscal year, we have arrested 440 people.''
   Unlike many government agencies which announce their total drug
seizures with great fanfare, the postal inspectors are so low key
about their work that the spokesman couldn't come up with the total
amount of illicit drugs they seized last year.
   Generally, however, because of the nature of the mail system,
the Postal Inspection Service doesn't make large seizures that
could compare with those by other agencies.
   ``In a boat or a container ship or an airliner, they can move
tons in those kind of things,'' he said. ``In the mail you can't do
that, at least not in an individual package.''
   McClure declined to give too many details on the service's
operations, saying, ``The bad guys read newspapers, too.''
   But he said the service gets help from other agencies such as
the Customs Service, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration
and local police while developing its own cases through informants
and other tips.
   The service's recent finds include $8,000 worth of PCP packed in
baby food jars and being mailed from Los Angeles to Broken Arrow,
Okla., and illicit steroids being distributed by two men in Miami
who were arrested April 17. Officials said the latter case _ which
involved a two-year investigation by postal inspectors and the FBI
_ was the largest illicit steroid ring ever busted.
   The Postal Inspection Service has no idea how much drugs are
moving through the U.S. mail system because it's illegal for the
agency to inspect the mail without a federal warrant, he said.
   Yet, the service presumes the amount is increasing.
   ``There's a direct relationship between the amount of drugs in
society and the amount being passed through the Postal Service,''
McClure said. When one mode of transporting drugs is shut down,
``dealers find new avenues to move the narcotics.''
   Of the 1,800 postal inspectors nationwide, some 800 do criminal
investigations including mail fraud, child pornography and internal
theft, he said.
   The number focusing full time on drugs doubled from 50 to 100 in
the current fiscal year, McClure said Tuesday. And when a case
comes along, other inspectors are put to work on it. ``We'll even
bring them from across the country if the magnitude of the case
calls for that,'' he said.
   The mailings aren't limited to any part of the country, he said.
``There are mailings from Miami to California, from New York to
Miami. It's crazy.''
   Private mail services such as United Parcel Service and Federal
Express are not scrutinized as carefully as the U.S. mail.
Spokesmen for both companies said they cooperate with authorities
on drug investigations, but neither would indicate exactly how
often this has occurred nor whether the companies instigated any
probes.
   The Customs Service is cooperating with the Postal Service to
clear mail from 29 high-risk drug source countries at the port of
arrival, according to Dennis Shimkoski of Customs.
   In the first half of fiscal 1989, which began last October,
Customs seized 65 pounds of heroin, 216 pounds of opium, 10 pounds
of cocaine and 297 pounds of marijuana at the 21 international mail
branches, he said.
   In fiscal 1988, Customs seized 164 pounds of heroin, 1,600
pounds of opium and 1,310 pounds of marijuana. There were no
significant amounts of cocaine mailed, Shimkoski said.

   It took some doing, but lawyers in a
murder trial managed to pick a Smith County jury made up of people
who weren't related.
   Defense attorney Jim Dukes asked if any of the 83 prospective
jurors were related by blood or marriage, and about half the people
in the courtroom stood up. ``We're going to have a family reunion
here in a minute,'' Dukes, of Hattiesburg, said Monday.
   Prospective jurors included a husband and wife, a father and
daughter, a mother and son, several sets of brothers and sisters,
aunts and uncles and numerous cousins _ some of them as far removed
as third or fourth.
   ``I would say this would be unusual. I don't remember this ever
happening before,'' said Circuit Clerk Billy Tadlock.
   A total of 258 people were summoned from Smith County as
prospective jurors for the trial of Cecil Green, who is charged
with killing a police officer on Nov. 1, 1988. Many of the 258 had
already been excused for other reasons by the time Dukes asked
about relatives Monday.
   Dukes asked the prospects if kinship with other jurors would
sway their thinking.
   ``If we go in opposite directions, I might want to know why.
Sure, it would be difficult to do _ vote opposite ways,'' said
Alice Evans, whose son and brother were also prospective jurors.
   ``Put it like this. We don't communicate that much,''
prospective juror James G. McCullum said of his wife, Brenda S.
McLaurin, as the entire courtroom broke into laughter. ``She runs
her own life and I run mine,'' he said.
   McLaurin and Evans were among the 12 selected for jury service.
Their relatives went home.
   Evans is not related to the prosecutor in the case, District
Attorney Bob Evans, who said he found one of his own cousins in the
jury pool.
   ``She left early,'' he said.

   Syrian gunners firing giant mortars
battled Christian forces in an ill-matched duel Tuesday that each
accused the other of starting in an effort to sabotage a new Arab
peace initiative.
   Police reported two people were killed and 16 wounded as
artillery and rockets pounded the Lebanese capital for six hours.
   The fighting shadowed a peacemaking effort by foreign ministers
of the 22-state Arab League, who are to meet Wednesday in Tunis.
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun was reported to have accepted
a league proposal for 200 Arab observers to enforce and monitor a
cease-fire.
   But the plan was jolted when Justice Minister Nabih Berri
rejected having more foreign troops in Lebanon, where his staunch
ally, Syria, has 40,000 troops under a 1976 league peacekeeping
mandate.
   ``We don't need more armies,'' Berri said Tuesday.
   His remarks are seen as a rejection by proxy of the Arab plan
from Syria, Lebanon's main power broker.
   Berri's Shiite Moslem Amal militia so far has taken no part in
the fighting between Aoun's mainly Christian troops and an alliance
of Syrian troops and Moslem Druse militiamen that outgun and
outnumber the Christians.
   Sheik Sabah Ahmed, Kuwait's foreign minister and architect of
the Arab plan, left Tuesday for Tunis declaring: ``We hope our
Lebanese brothers will discern the interests of their people and
country and stop fighting so that dialogue and wisdom replace
shells and cannons.''
   In Tunisia, the Palestine Liberation Organization announced a
plan to send its own forces to quell the fighting, but the plan is
not expected to win much support.
   ``Observers say who is wrong and who is right. But to stop the
killing of the people, we need real forces,'' said PLO spokesman
Ahmed Abderrahman.
   Earlier Arab attempts to halt the carnage have failed, as has a
U.N. Security Council appeal Monday for an end to the battles that
erupted March 8. Since then, at least 272 people have been killed
and 991 wounded.
   Pope John Paul II repeated his calls for peace Tuesday at a Mass
in the Vatican, where he invited Lebanese clerics and families.
   The London-based Mideast Mirror newsletter quoted Aoun as saying
he will accept an Arab observer force ``as a first step'' toward a
political solution ``so long as it doesn't include any of the
participants of the fighting.''
   ``The ultimate objective ... remains ending the Syrian and
Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory,'' it quoted Aoun as
saying.
   Some Arab states support Christian demands that Syria withdraw
because it has violated its mandate by shelling them. Syria says it
will not withdraw.
   Tuesday's random bombardment raged from midnight to daybreak,
forcing tens of thousands of residents to shelter in underground
bunkers. It later slackened into sporadic shelling.
   The Syrians hammered the east of the city, heart of the besieged
310-square-mile Christian enclave, with 240mm mortars and B-21
launchers that fire 40 122mm rockets in 20 seconds.
   Beirut shook as Aoun's forces lobbed 155mm and 130mm howitzer
and mortar shells into west Beirut. Ambulances with wailing sirens
sped through rubble-strewn streets.
   Four shells crashed into the garden of east Beirut's Comfort
Hotel, shattering windows and windshields of five cars of the U.N.
monitoring force in Lebanon, a U.N. official said.
   In west Beirut, the facade of the West German cultural Goethe
Institute was destroyed.
   Police said west Beirut's Sahel Hospital was hit, but no
patients were hurt.
   The Arab League proposes an interim truce to stabilize the
situation until a political solution is worked out providing for
presidential elections and the formation of a coalition government.

<TEXT>
   In his first 100 days, President Bush put the
imperial trappings of the White House in storage. The place now
rings with the squeal of grandchildren and the clang of horseshoes.
   Born to wealth and privilege, George Herbert Walker Bush brought
to the Executive Mansion the down-to-earth tastes and attitudes of
a common person: hot dogs and baseball games, barbecues and country
music, guided tours of the grounds, side trips to tourist
attractions.
   Yet for all the bustle of the White House these days, the
nation's 41st president often rides about town in a silent
motorcade, politely stopping at red lights to avoid tying up
traffic.
   Historians and political analysts may differ over the
president's accomplishments in these first 100 days, but few will
deny he's been enjoying every one of them.
   ``Bush is sort of a James Stewart figure,'' said Rep. Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, recalling the mix
of aw-shucks naivete and stubbornness in the actor's
characterization in the movie classic, ``Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington.''
   ``The president's personal style is nice and warm and collegial.
It's just the way he is. He's also a very tough man,'' Gingrich
said, adding, ``Reagan was a star. Bush is more of a senior
player-coach type.''
   Riding the crest of 60 percent-plus approval ratings in public
opinion polls, Bush is settling with obvious relish and comfort
into the job that he long coveted. At the same time, he has
eschewed efforts to compare him with his predecessor, who also
scored high in the polls.
   ``I certainly know something about following a class act,'' Bush
told a recent audience.
   Bush himself can joke that his first 100 days are ``about the
same as Martin Van Buren's'' _ who was forced in his first 100 days
to deal with one of the nation's worst financial panics and the
long depression that followed _ and whose name the president enjoys
invoking.
   But Bush's constant-motion style gives aides and reporters a
difficult time keeping up with him.
   Beginning work each day at 7 a.m., Bush routinely puts in
11-hour workdays in the Oval Office, although he also has been
known to slip away in the middle of the afternoon to play tennis,
jog, throw horseshoes or play racquetball in a congressional
gymnasium.
   While he seldom held news conferences during his presidential
campaign, Bush has met roughly once a week with reporters since
taking office, in forums ranging from regular news conferences to
small-group chats in the Oval Office.
   He's travelled to four foreign counties and 17 states in his
first three months in office.
   Bush set a populist tone on his first full day in office,
opening the White House and its grounds to the public. And he's had
a stream of visitors in ever since, among them Democratic leaders
who got little such attention from Reagan.
   ``I've been here more ... since Bush has been president than I
was in eight years under his predecessor,'' said Rep. Jack Brooks,
D-Texas.
   Congressional leaders who have met frequently with Bush say he
is a good listener at high-level meetings, but a tough negotiator.
   ``I am amazed at how much at peace with himself he is, and
really knows where he wants to go, how he wants to do it,'' said
his chief of staff, John Sununu.
   Sununu said Bush has no trouble making quick decisions, even
though the president himself jokes that ``People say I'm
indecisive. I don't know about that.''
   Aides and associates say he gives careful attention to detail,
even checking travel manifests to make sure there aren't too many
staff members on trips, while always keeping up to speed on the
issues of the day.
   In addition to daily intelligence and national security
briefings, he reads ``about five papers as far as I can see'' each
morning, said his wife, Barbara.
   Participants at Cabinet meetings say the president often stays
on the sidelines and lets others do most of the talking, while
other times jumping in and vigorously leading the discussions.
   ``He enjoys the give and take,'' said Vice President Dan Quayle.
``He enjoys having ideas put forward. ... He enjoys the competition
of ideas and discussion of policy and where we ought to be going.''
   Bush, who as vice president had lunch once a week with Reagan,
has carried the custom forward. He eats a private lunch each
Thursday with Quayle, who said he has complete access to Bush and
can go into his office any time he wants.
   Bush is ``a much more open, gregarious, outgoing president than
we've had in a long time,'' said Norman Ornstein, a political
analyst with the American Enterprise Institute.
   ``His early reputation is that this is a president who makes
things happen. Once you establish that reputation, you are going to
carry it to your advantage for a long time.''
   Still, others have trouble focusing on Bush's true political and
policy identity in all the swirl of activity.
   ``The non-image is the image he has created for himself,'' said
Tom Griscom, who was Reagan's communications director.
   Bush, after all, is the president who begins speeches on
education with the phrase, ``you know;'' who talks about ``things''
and ``stuff;'' who frequently stumbles over his own lines.
   ``It's been said that sometimes I don't speak in very good
English and that I have a hard time being understood,'' he told a
White House audience the other day. ``I'll admit it, it's true. And
all I can say is that I'm in pretty good company, though. Look at
Yogi Berra.''
   ``I love to quote Yogi,'' Bush, captain of Yale's 1948 baseball
team, told another audience.
   ``He once said at a state dinner right here in this building,
`How could you get a conversation started in there? Everybody was
talking too much.'''
   And if Berra, the Yankee catcher who turned the language on its
ear, is the baseball great that Bush quotes the most, the one he
admires the most is another Yankee, the low-keyed Lou Gehrig, whom
Bush calls his personal hero.
   ``He played in 2,130 straight games _ a record which still
stands,'' Bush said. ``But more than that, he was a good and decent
man about whom a teammate said, `Every day, any day, he just went
out and did his job.'''

<HEAD>Central Committee Pensions Off Some Senior Members</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with three grafs with number of retirements, including
Gromyko's; picks up 5th pvs: Gorbachev has...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party's Central Committee today
retired 74 senior members, including former President Andrei A.
Gromyko, to make way for a renewal of the party's top policy-making
body that likely will strengthen President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Party ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev told a news conference
the committee unanimously approved 110 requests for retirement by
Central Committee members, non-voting committee members, and
members of the party's Central Revisions Committee.
   The official Tass news agency transmitted a list of the retirees
that included Gromyko, who retired as president last fall, former
Politburo members Geidar A. Aliev, Mikhail S. Solomentsev and
former candidate Politburo member Vladimir I. Dolgikh.
   Gorbachev has complained opposition to his reform program exists
within the Central Committee, which has included many officials who
gained membership before he became party leader in March 1985.
   Medvedev said 83 members, or more than one-quarter of the
300-member body, have lost the government and party jobs that
entitled them to Central Committee membership.
   Western observers call that group the ``dead souls'' and say it
can be a conservative presence on the Central Committee.
   Among those promoted to full Central Committee membership were
Yevgeny Velikhov, the vice president of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences who is believed to be a supporter of Gorbachev; Yuli A.
Kvitsinsky, an arms control expert who is ambassador to West
Germany; and Yevgeny Primakov, director of the Institute of World
Economics and International Relations.
   Gorbachev opened the meeting today with a speech on the party's
program and local organizations, Tass said.
   The full agenda of the one-day meeting was not disclosed, but
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Monday that
the issue of nationalities would not be the main topic of
discussion.
   At least 20 people were killed in Soviet Georgia on April 9 when
troops clashed with demonstrators demanding independence, and last
year more than 90 died in the neighboring republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan.
   Gorbachev has said the Central Committee will devote a summer
meeting to policy toward the Soviet Union's 100 ethnic groups.
   Today's meeting was the first Central Committee session since at
least three dozen top officials across the country were defeated in
parliamentary elections March 26.
   Among the losers were the premiers of Lativa and Lithuania, the
mayor and party chief of Kiev and the mayor and No. 2 party leader
of Moscow.
   The defeats were particularly embarrassing for Communists who
ran unopposed. Others lost as they faced opponents for the first
time in the first multiple-candidate races in 70 years.
   The Central Committee has the power to oust members who were
defeated in their parliamentary bids.
   Gorbachev portrayed the parliamentary elections for a new
2,250-seat parliament as a referendum on perestroika and said party
and government officials lost because they ``were restructuring
slowly.''
   The Central Committee laid the foundation for perestroika,
Gorbachev's wide-ranging overhaul of the Soviet economy, political
and social systems, in April 1985, six weeks after Gorbachev became
party chief.

<HEAD>Study Group Says OPM Appointees Often Hostile to Civil Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Presidents Carter and Reagan ``made
bureaucrat-bashing the norm'' and Reagan's political appointees at
the Office of Personnel Management were often hostile to the civil
service, a congressional panel was told Tuesday.
   The congressional Federal Government Service Task Force received
reports from task forces of the National Commission on Public
Service, a private organization that has recommended pay increases
and other steps to make federal service more attractive.
   The commission's task force on recruitment and retention said in
its report that the personnel management office, created by
Congress in 1978, ``has not met early expectations and remains, in
many ways, an agency in search of an identity.''
   ``Although OPM operated for a brief time at the end of the
Carter administration, it was President Reagan who really shaped
the early character of OPM,'' the task force said.
   It said Reagan's first appointee to head OPM, Donald J. Devine,
``took a political approach to both the position and the agency''
and more than quadrupled the number of political appointees,
increasing them from eight to more than 32.
   ``Equally troubling is the fact that the political appointees to
OPM were often actively hostile to the career civil service,'' the
task force said. It charged that ``the organization's effectiveness
was severely diminished'' by low morale among the remaining career
employees.
   Rep. Norman D. Dicks, D-Wash., a co-chairman of the
congressional task force, said, ``Clearly, the public's perception
of the federal civil service has been influenced by negative
messages from some elected officials in recent years, too many of
whom have been willing to blame civil servants for the country's
problems.''
   ``The previous two presidents made bureaucrat-bashing the
norm,'' Dicks said.
   The commission task force said the appointment of Constance
Horner as director of OPM in 1985 ``signaled a new direction'' for
the agency, which in 1987 and 1988 ``paid serious attention to
promoting the public service.''
   ``There is consensus that OPM stands at the crossroads,'' the
task force said.
   One of the commission's recommendations is a sharp decrease in
the ratio of political to career appointees in the federal
government.
   Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., also a co-chairman of the
congressional task force, said that ``career executives have been
driven off the leadership team in recent years, displaced by
deepening layers of political appointees.''
   ``This is a dangerous trend for the federal government,'' Hoyer
said. ``Career executives help assure continuity as political
appointees change.''
   Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve chairman and chairman of
the privately financed study group, said President Bush ``speaks
clearly and spontaneously about the value of public service'' and
``I think that is an indication and a hopeful sign that attitudes
in this area may be in the process of changing.''
   The commission's recommendations, calling among other things for
a 50 percent increase over two years in pay for senior federal
officials, judges and members of Congress, were submitted to the
president March 29. Bush has recommended pay raises for judges, but
has withheld recommendations on other increases.

<TEXT>
   A woman condemned to death for bombing
a South Korean airliner probably will be pardoned even if the
Supreme Court upholds her sentence, government officials said
Tuesday.
   Confessed communist agent Kim Hyon Hui was convicted Tuesday and
sentenced to death by a three-judge panel headed by senior Judge
Chung Sang-hwak, who said her crime underlined North Korea's
unchanging policy of destroying South Korea's freedom.
   Pyongyang has denied Kim's assertions that North Korean leaders
ordered her to bomb the Korean Air passenger plane in 1987. All 115
people aboard died when the plane disappeared over the Andaman Sea
near the coast of Burma.
   ``We have an enemy which always tries to destroy our liberal
democratic system. We must face that reality with resolute
determination,'' Chung said in the verdict of the three-judge panel.
   Kim, 27, wept and her shoulders heaved as he pronounced her
guilty of violating national security and aviation laws and
sentenced her to death.
   South Korean law gives Kim one week to appeal. Ahn Dong-il, her
lawyer, said they have not yet decided whether to do so.
   Relatives of those killed sat quietly in the court, watching Kim
as she stood before the judge with downcast eyes. She said nothing
before being led away.
   ``She deserves death because she killed 115 people,'' Park
Son-jin, 60, whose son was on the plane, said after the hearing.
   Hundreds of security agents and police surrounded the courthouse
to prevent more angry protests by relatives, or a possible threat
from North Korea.
   The judge said there is no doubt Kim planted the bomb aboard the
Boeing 707 that disappeared Nov. 29, 1987, on a flight from Baghdad
to Seoul.
   Kim has said she blew up the plane on orders from Kim Jong Il,
son and heir of North Korean President Kim Il Sung, to disrupt the
Seoul Olympics.
   She has said she wants to die to atone for her sin.
   But South Korean officials said privately they expect she will
be reprieved on grounds she was duped by North Korea and has
repented.
   Court officials said if Kim is pardoned, she will be free on a
stay of the sentence. Similar arrangements have freed other North
Korean agents pardoned under a special amnesty after they switched
loyalty.
   North Korea denies involvement in the bombing and claims it was
engineered by South Korea to embarrass the Pyongyang government.
The two nations have been bitter rivals since their land was
divided in 1945.
   Testimony given by Kim corroborated the findings of bomb experts
who said the plane exploded in less than a second. No bodies were
found.
   Kim has said she and another agent pretended to be Japanese
tourists and planted the bomb, which was disguised as a radio and a
liquor bottle.
   The two were arrested a few days later and tried to take cyanide
hidden in cigarettes. The other agent, an elderly man, died.

   Three youths attacked Morton Downey Jr. in
an airport bathroom, cutting off some of his hair and painting a
swastika on his head, said the controversial TV talk show host.
   ``They sieg heiled me when they left,'' Downey told television
station KOFY after Monday night's incident at San Francisco
International Airport.
   Downey said one of the youths ``got me from behind, another got
me around the neck, one sat on me.''
   Downey said he was not injured and did not go to a hospital. He
was in San Francisco to promote his television show on KOFY.
   ``I think I kicked one of them,'' Downey said. ``At least I hope
I did.''
   Airport spokesman Ron Wilson said police are investigating
Downey's report.
   He said officers and medical crews were called for help and
found Downey already in the back of his limousine.
   A man who was in the restroom at the same time as Downey told
investigators he did not see any confrontation, Wilson said. ``The
only thing that he saw was he did see Mr. Downey walk briskly out
of the restroom, assisted by a couple of young men who had been
with him. They were friends of Downey who had traveled in the
limousine with him.''
   In an interview at his San Francisco hotel room early Tuesday,
Downey said he thought his attackers were ``skinheads'' such as the
young racists represented and reviled on Downey's program.
   ``It's the skinheads, the same ones who have threatened me for
so long,'' he said, discounting the chance his assailants were from
San Francisco's gay community, which has been critical of his
frequent tirades against homosexuals.
   Ed Walsh, KOFY's news assignment editor, said only a small
portion of Downey's hair was cut.
   ``It looks like something a little kid would do to another
little kid,'' he said. ``Kind of like a bald spot. I think it was
done with scissors and the swastika was made with a marker pen.''
   About the same time as Downey said the assault occurred, a bomb
threat forced KOFY to go off the air during the time slot for the
syndicated series ``The Morton Downey Jr. Show.''
   The nature of the threat was not explained. The show _ scheduled
to begin at 11 p.m. _ returned at 11:35 p.m.
   The show was making its first appearance in San Francisco since
it was canceled last summer in response to protests by local gay
activist organizations.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radio messages recorded the morning the
Exxon Valdez ran aground show the ship's captain spent up to an
hour trying to rock the tanker free, a move the Coast Guard says
could have sunk the ship.
   The transcripts were obtained in a Freedom of Information Act
request by the Anchorage Daily News, which published details today.
   The state of Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation
issued a new analysis saying 11.2 million gallons of oil spilled
from the Valdez, rather than the 10.1 million originally estimated
by Exxon.
   Also today, Exxon Corp. said 31 lawsuits and 1,300 claims
ranging from $500 to $4 million have been filed against the company
in the wake of the spill. At a meeting of security analysts in New
York, Exxon officials declined to put a total dollar value on the
lawsuits or the claims.
   In other developments, millions of tiny salmon have been
released into oil-tainted Prince William Sound, and wildlife
officials were deploying fireworks, shotguns and other noisemakers
to scare migrating birds to safety.
   Transcripts of March 24 radio messages between Coast Guard
Commander Steve McCall and tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood indicate
the skipper tried to free the ship despite warnings the tanker
might be unstable.
   In the first transmission, Hazelwood informed the Coast Guard in
Valdez that he was aground, ``leaking some oil and we're going to
be here for a while.''
   The ship's logs indicate the ship ran aground on Bligh Reef some
23 minutes earlier. The delay in reporting and Hazelwood's position
report are subjects of an investigation.
   McCall was rousted from bed to deal with the crisis, and
contacted Hazelwood for a situation report.
   ``We`re working our way off the reef,'' Hazelwood said. ``We've,
ah, the vessel has been holed and we're acertaining, right now
we're trying just to get her off the reef and we'll get back to you
as soon as we can.''
   McCall told Hazelwood to take it ``slow and easy,'' and said
help was on the way.
   ``Before you make any drastic attempt to get away, make sure you
don't, you know, start doing any ripping,'' McCall said. ``You got
a rising tide ... I wouldn't recommend doing much wiggling.''
   A conversation about 1{ hours after the first transmission
indicated the Exxon Valdez's engines had stopped and apparently the
effort to free the tanker had halted as well.
   There was no immediate indication whether trying to free the
ship made the problem worse. The ship had at least eight major
holes up to 24-feet in diameter.
   ``In my opinion, if it had slid off the reef it would have
sunk,'' McCall said in an interview with the Daily News.
   With high winds and rough seas hampering the cleanup Monday for
the second straight day, the focus was on wildlife as the state
announced Exxon had agreed to build a second otter rehabilitation
center.
   The troop ship USS Juneau, meanwhile, arrived from San Diego to
become a floating mobile base for up to 400 cleanup workers who
will go out in small boats.
   The weather, with seas up to 18 feet, kept oil-skimming boats
hugging the shore in the sound and the Gulf of Alaska. But a
fishermen's flotilla attacked encroaching oil off the southern tip
of Kenai Peninsula near the mouth of Cook Inlet. The boats dragged
nets, with absorbent material sewn into them, the way they would
gather herring this time of year.
   They hoped to block a sheen of oil from fish-rich Kachemak Bay,
said Loren Flagg, a retired state biologist helping run the
unsanctioned effort.
   ``We're making a last stand as far as getting fishermen
involved,'' said Flagg. ``This bay is our priority. We'd like to
see our effort institutionalized. We can get close to shores where
the big skimmers can't.''
   Proximity also was a factor in opening the second otter
rehabilitation center in Seward, about 130 miles southwest of
Valdez.
   Exxon insisted there was adequate capacity at the Valdez center
to handle otters found outside the sound. But the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service argued that transporting the otters to Valdez
would subject them to more stress, and diminish their chances of
survival.
   Twenty-four million salmon fry have been released since late
Sunday because a new plankton bloom made conditions in the sound as
good as they will get.
   ``It's a little earlier than we expected,'' said Heather
McCarty, spokeswoman for the Prince William Sound Aquaculture
Association, which owns three hatcheries in the sound. ``It caught
us a little by surprise. We really have no choice but to release
them now.''
   More were being released this week. Once the fish reach a
certain size they can be harvested by fishermen, who pay fees to
the hatcheries.
   With officials counting nearly 3,000 birds killed by the
nation's worst oil spill and 15 million expected to arrive soon,
the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service said it would begin its
bird-hazing plan today.
   Crews planned to use propane cannons, shotguns loaded with
special ``cracker'' shells, whistler bombs and bottle rockets to
keep the arriving birds away from contaminated areas that have been
prime nesting areas along the southern Alaska coast.
   Reflective tape also was to be used to keep birds from landing
in oiled areas.

   Unions said the subway's 12,000 workers voted to strike to

   In his first 100 days, President Bush put the
imperial trappings of the White House in storage. The place now
rings with the squeal of xpediting U.S. economic and
military aid and states: ``President Reagan personally authorized
the entire plan.''
   Kozak testimony was in response to questions from subcommittee
chairman David Obey, D-Wis., who asserted that his panel had been
misled or lied to by Reagan administration officials when it sought
to find out at the time whether foreign aid money was being
indirectly used to help the Contras at a time when such aid was
prohibited.
   Kozak said he had learned before coming to Capitol Hill that he
would be asked about apparent discrepancies between the North trial
document and what administration witnesses had told Congress. He
said he called the White House for guidance on how to respond
before testifying.
   ``The whole proposed linkage that was included in (North's) plan
was disapproved, was not made, there was no `discreet emissary',''
Kozak said.
   In an admission-of-fact document prepared by North's lawyers and
the government, North ``linked a trip of the vice president that
was planned well in advance of even the preparation of this plan,
publicly announced, and which did occur, to a secret plan that was
never appproved,'' Kozak told the panel.
   Bush's talks with high-level officials, including Honduran
President Roberto Suazo, never mentioned the quid-pro-quo link, he
said. Kozak said he has seen memos outlining the conversations, and
``they're not talking about conditionality of the type that (North)
document implies.''
   Kozak said the Bush administration has been frustrated at not
being able to comment on the 42-page document since it was
introduced at North's trial on April 6. But he said he now could
comment on the admissions because North's jury is now sequestered
and can't be swayed by his comments.
   He said the paper was suggested by Judge Gerhard Gesell, who is
presiding over the North trial, and prepared by North and his
lawyers ``as an expedient way of managing the trial, avoiding
classification issues, avoiding long argumentation and calling
witnessess over material that might not be relevant to that trial.''
   ``When I saw this thing, I started walking around my office
shouting,'' he said. ``It was so distorted, so misleading... But I
was told that we had no role in being able to influence the content
of this document, other than to ensure that no classified
information was in there.''

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major disagreement within NATO over
disarmament overtures to the East heightened Tuesday with West
Germany's insistence on superpower talks on short-range nuclear
weapons despite a clear rebuff from Washington.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg returned from Washington after a failed attempt
to persuade the United States of a need for talks on the
short-range weapons.
   U.S. officials held out against the West Germans, citing fears
that negotiations on the weapons could lead to their elimination
and increase the threat from superior East bloc conventional forces.
   West Germans, who in general believe the threat from the Warsaw
Pact has been reduced, have become increasingly eager for the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization to speed up disarament talks with the
Soviet bloc.
   Despite Washington's refusal to budge, Genscher said West
Germany was sticking to its position and would continue discussions
within NATO to resolve the stalemate.
   ``We are going into the talks with our partners with the same
position that we have already worked out,'' Genscher said.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative government, facing
possible defeat in next year's federal elections, has been trying
to woo voters in the face of the growing anti-military mood.
   West Germany's opposition party, the Social Democrats, turned up
the heat on Kohl to not back down on the issue. Party chairman
Hans-Jochen Vogel demanded that Kohl ``abide by the national
consensus.''
   Vogel said short-range weapons should be ultimately removed from
West Germany.
   The debate over short-range nuclear weapons has created
divisions within the alliance with a key NATO summit just a month
away.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who sides with the
United States in the disagreement, is scheduled to fly to West
Germany on Sunday and is expected to take up the matter with Kohl.
   The Netherlands, once one of the most anti-nuclear voices in the
NATO alliance, also backed the United States.
   ``The Dutch view doesn't match the German view as it has now
been publicized'' during Genscher's and Stoltenberg's Washington
visit, Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter van Vliet said Tuesday in
The Hague.
   But Kohl has the support of several other NATO countries,
including Norway, Belgium and Denmark.
   Kohl also wants NATO to postpone a final decision on the
alliance's plans for upgrading short-range nuclear weapons, and has
the support of several smaller NATO countries.
   Both Genscher and Stoltenberg said they were optimistic NATO
would be able to forge a common position on the nuclear weapons
before its summit in Brussels at the end of May. Neither official
gave any indication of a breakthrough.
   Genscher said that during his visit to the United States, it
became clear to him that Washington ``recognizes our right to have
a say in this matter.''
   Most of NATO's short-range nuclear weapons _ 88 Lance launchers
with a range of up to about 75 miles _ are based in West Germany.
   Because of their short range, the nuclear-tipped missiles are
designed to be used almost exclusively on German soil.
   Genscher also said he believes that West Germany's view on
short-range weapons ``will have a significant effect on the
formulation of a (common) position within the alliance,'' but he
did not elaborate.
   Kohl's government, in a surprise move, announced last week that
it favors prompt superpower negotiations on reducing short-range
nuclear weapons. Just a week earlier, the Warsaw Pact made a
detailed proposal for starting up such talks.
   U.S. officials have said they fear the Warsaw Pact may be trying
to drive a wedge among NATO nations with a flurry of recent
disarmament proposals.

   Sales of existing homes dropped 4.3 percent in
March, the third straight monthly decline, as rising mortgage
interest rates made more inroads into the housing market, a real
estate trade group said Tuesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.33 million units in March, the slowest pace since February 1988.
   Sales had dropped 2 percent in February and 9.4 percent in
January.
   The March figures were the latest in a series of reports that
indicate rising interest rates are slowing the economy and taking a
toll on home sales and residential construction. Last week, the
government reported that construction of new homes and apartments
declined 5.4 percent in March, the second straight monthly decline.
   Because housing usually slows down in advance of other sectors
of the economy, the weak performance has heightened fears that a
recession could come later this year or in early 1990. The Federal
Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up interest rates as part
of a campaign to slow the economy and keep inflation in check.
   ``This is another piece of evidence that things are softening
and that high interest rates do make a difference,'' Maury Harris,
chief economist for PaineWebber Inc., said of the latest housing
report.
   Fixed-rate home mortgages averaged between 10.86 percent and
11.22 percent in March, up a full percentage point from a year
earlier, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Ira Gribin, president of the Realtors, said the higher rates are
having their biggest impact on first-time home buyers. He said they
are ``the first to leave the market and the last who are able to
get back in.''
   With fewer sales last month to first-time buyers, the median
price of existing homes sold rose $1,200 to $93,100, meaning half
the homes sold for more and half for less.
   ``What we are seeing is definitely a trade-up market,'' said
John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the Realtors. ``People still
in the market are those with the incomes to withstand higher
monthly mortgage payments resulting from higher interest rates.''
   Economist Lyle Gramley of the Mortgage Bankers Association said
that while further declines lie ahead for the housing industry,
``this is not a collapse of the housing market.''
   ``Monetary policy used to clobber the housing market,'' Gramley
said. ``Now it's nibbling gently on the fringes.''
   Gramley said slower growth is ``just what the doctor ordered''
to dampen inflationary pressures and keep the economic expansion
alive.
   By region, the sharpest decline in home sales last month was in
the Northeast, where the resale pace was down 10 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 540,000 units. Sales in the
Northeast had declined 15.5 percent during February.
   Sales last month were down 7.6 percent in the Midwest to an
annual rate of 850,000 units and fell 3.1 percent in the South to a
rate of 1.27 million units. The only increase was recorded in the
West, where sales rose 4.7 percent to an annual rate of 670,000
units.

   The espionage conviction of Richard Miller,
the only FBI agent ever convicted of spying, was overturned by a
federal appeals court today because of the use of lie-detector
evidence at his trial.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the jury should
not have been told the results of Miller's polygraph examinations,
which concluded that he was lying about his motives.
   The polygraph evidence bolstered the credibility of Miller's
later admissions of wrongdoing, ``the heart of the prosecution's
case,'' the court said in a 3-0 ruling.
   The decision entitles Miller to a new trial on charges that he
spied for the Soviet Union.
   Miller was convicted in June 1986 of passing secrets to the
Soviets through his lover, Svetlana Ogorodnikova, in return for
promises of $65,000 in cash and gold. He was sentenced to two life
terms plus 50 years in prison.
   She and her husband, Nikolay Ogorodnikov, pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to commit espionage and are serving prison terms.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner was informed of the ruling while
attending a speech by President Bush on a ranch in Riverside County.
   ``Oh really?'' Bonner said. ``We'll obviously want to take a
look at the 9th Circuit opinion. We may re-appeal and we have other
means. If those fail, we will retry the case. We'll deal with it
when we see the decision,'' Bonner said.
   Joel Levine, a Los Angeles lawyer who represented Miller,
reacted by noting the time Miller has spent behind bars since his
arrest: ``We're very, very pleased, but we would be more pleased if
we didn't have to go through five years waiting for a fair trial
with a client in custody.''
   Miller, a 20-year FBI veteran, was portrayed by prosecutors as a
bitter, vengeful failure easily recruited as a spy. The defense
described him as a well-meaning FBI misfit who dreamed of redeeming
his career by infiltrating the Soviet spy network in the United
States.
   He was charged with furnishing a clasified document called the
Positive Intelligence Reporting Guide, which sets forth annual U.S.
intelligence needs, to his lover for delivery to the Soviet
consulate in San Francisco in August 1984.
   In reversing his conviction, the appeals court ruled there were
several errors by U.S. District Judge David Kenyon, who presided
over the trial in Los Angeles.
   One was Kenyon's decision to admit evidence of lie-detector
tests that the FBI gave Miller during the investigation of the case.
   Miller insisted during the questioning that his actions were
intended to benefit the FBI. But the polygraph examiner told him he
had failed the tests. Shortly afterward, Miller said for the first
time that he had given a classified document to Mrs. Ogorodnikova;
at trial, he contended his admission was false.
   Over defense objections, Kenyon allowed evidence of the results
as well as the questions and answers of Miller's lie-detector test,
saying those tests had set the scene for his disputed admission
about the document.
   The appeals court, in an opinion by Judge Dorothy Nelson, noted
that lie-detector results are generally prohibited as evidence of
the truthfulness of the person being questioned, because of doubts
about the reliability of the device.
   Lie-detector evidence can be admitted for other purposes in
limited circumstances, Nelson said. In several cases a jury has
been told that a defendant confessed after being told he failed a
polygraph. But she said Miller's jury was told much more damaging
information.
   Nelson also said Kenyon improperly admitted evidence that Miller
had once bribed an FBI informant. In addition, she said testimony
by a man presented by the government as an expert on Soviet
intelligence and recruiting tactics was improperly used to attack
Miller's character.
   Judges Stephen Reinhardt and Diarmuid O'Scannlain joined the
opinion.

<HEAD>Controversy Over Planned Renovation of Anne Frank's Refuge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neighbors of the house where Anne
Frank hid from the Nazis are waging a campaign against a projected
renovation of the building, now a top tourist attraction.
   Fearing loss of privacy as well as inconvenience caused by
construction work, residents of the central Amsterdam district
housing the last home of the world-famous teen-age Nazi victim have
written a letter protesting the four-year renovation plan.
   The Dutch capital's agency for the preservation of monuments is
also opposed to the project, with its director saying the plan will
``destroy ... the memories it conveys.''
   At issue is an ``urgently necessary project to create sufficient
room'' for the Anne Frank House's 560,000 annual visitors, said
Nico Salm, a spokesman for the foundation that owns the building.
   Pending City Hall approval, the $6 million renovation is to
start in January, Salm said in an interview Tuesday.
   Anne Frank was a Jewish girl whose posthumously published diary
on her life-in-hiding in an annex behind the Amsterdam canal house
gained her a worldwide audience. In the closing weeks of World War
II, she died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp at the age of
15 after having been caught in 1944.
   The museum not only tells the story of Anne's short life _
including a display of the annex in its original state _ but also
stages exhibitions on topics related to racism and repression.
   Opened in 1960 and consisting of two 18-foot-wide canal houses
built in the 18th century, the museum ``needs to be rearranged
internally to improve access to the annex and the other displays,''
Salm said.
   ``Right now, throngs of visitors are completely jamming the
premises so that the museum is almost collapsing under its own
success,'' Salm said. Under the new plan, the space dedicated to
the exhibition is to be tripled.
   ``The renovation project is not aimed at attracting even more
visitors, but to create a better atmosphere and more space for the
same amount of them,'' said Salm, who noted that on some busy
summer days, the museum is closed down for hours at a time to avoid
traffic jams inside.
   In their letter, the neighbors said a planned all-glass
extension in the museum's garden, which borders their houses, will
lead to an ``unacceptable'' loss of privacy and a decline in the
value of their real estate.
   They said they feared the construction work involved in the
project will cause inconvenience ``for years to come.'' A copy of
the letter was obtained by The Associated Press, but none of the
signatories was available for comment.
   Jan Dekkers, the director of Amsterdam's Bureau for Monument
preservation, said the 1,116-square-foot garden extension, which is
to be used as an exposition and lecture hall, ``is simply too
brazen ... it will definitely destroy the authenticity of the
complex, of the memories it conveys.''
   Mels Crouwel, the architect of the renovations, said that ``all
possible care has been taken to avoid vistas by the public into the
neighboring gardens.''
   The rest of the work will involve extensive renovations,
maintenance, and a complete reshuffle of the displays, as well as
conservation of the annex, where Anne and her family lived from
1942-44.
   Tipped off by a Nazi collaborator, the German police raided the
annex in August 1944, and Anne, her sister and their parents were
among the estimated 100,000 Dutch Jews deported to the
extermination camps during the five-year Nazi occupation of the
Netherlands.
   Only 10 percent of those returned after the war, among them
Anne's father, Otto, who published his daughter's diary in 1947.
Since then, the book has been translated into dozens of languages
and millions of copies have been sold.

   Four activists were arrested
today after they sealed themselves into an office at the Burroughs
Wellcome Inc. headquarters to protest the price of an AIDS drug.
   ``We've been trying to deal with this company for two years,''
said Peter Staley, one of the four men led in shackles from the
building 45 minutes after the takeover began.
   The activists were charged with trespassing and damage to
property.
   The pharmaceutical company produces Retrovir, which costs
patients or their insurers $8,000 to $10,000 a year, making it the
most expensive drug ever marketed. Formerly known as
azidothymidine, or AZT, the drug is the only U.S.
government-approved medicine aimed at halting the virus that causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The four protesters, who are scheduled for a May 4 court
appearance, are members of the New York-based AIDS Committee to
Unleash Power, said Jay Blotcher, a spokesman for the group. He
said Staley, 28, is a former Wall Street bond trader who has
AIDS-related symptoms.
   Staley, who said the activists were unarmed and non-violent,
said they intended to maintain their takeover until their demands
were met.
   ``We want a 25 percent reduction of the price of AZT,'' said
Staley. ``We want them to subsidize the government assistance
program on AZT.''
   Burroughs Wellcome spokeswoman Kathy Bartlett said the protest
was ``misdirected because we have been trying for three years to
get AIDS therapy to people suffering the disease.''
   Dan Baker, another ACT-UP spokesman, said sheriff's deputies and
Burroughs Wellcome guards broke down a non-permanent wall to get to
the activists, who had chained themselves to a door. He said his
group would pay for damages.
   Baker claimed Burroughs Wellcome made an 80 percent profit on
the drug. Ms. Bartlett said Burroughs Wellcome had never released
figures on its profit and she didn't know where the 80 percent
figure came from.
   Tests on AZT showed it can stop the AIDS virus from replicating,
but does not cure patients. An estimated 8 percent of AIDS patients
being tested died while on the drug, compared with 40 percent who
died while taking a placebo during a nine-month test period.
   The drug also increasingly is being prescribed for patients who
test positive for the human immunodeficiency virus but have not
developed any of the infections or cancers that kill AIDS patients.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control have estimated 1.5 million
Americans are infected with the virus.

<HEAD>House Ethics Panel Abruptly Suspends Texas Inquiry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ranking members of the House ethics
committee abruptly suspended their inquiry Tuesday after
businessmen failed to appear to testify about a lucrative oil
investment that benefited House Speaker Jim Wright's blind trust.
   Committee chairman Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said witnesses
scheduled to appear for questioning were being represented by a
Washington law firm, which told the panel the witnesses would not
be available.
   ``That law firm has informed us that the witness will not attend
today or tomorrow, so we have recessed our hearing,'' Dixon said.
He said the firm represented ``witnesses or a witness that would
appear today or tomorrow.''
   Rep. John Myers of Indiana, ranking Republican on the committee,
said, ``We don't have cooperative witnesses.''
   Dixon would not identify the witnesses or the law firm, but
Myers said San Antonio financier Morris Jaffe and his business
associate and son, M.D. (Doug) Jaffe Jr., had been scheduled to be
questioned Wednesday.
   Myers said refusal of a witness to appear before the panel is
not unique, and said he did not know when the committee would
resume taking depositions.
   Last week, the panel formally charged Wright with 69 violations
of House rules in his financial dealings with George Mallick, a
Fort Worth developer, and in sales of Wright's book, ``Reflections
of a Public Man.'' The panel said its inquiry remained open to look
into the oil deal, a drilling venture in Sabine Lake near the
Texas-Louisiana line.
   In Washington, Wright defended his book sales, saying ``I never
consciously considered that ... buying books as payment for my
making a speech.'' The ethics panel has alleged that he used bulk
sales of the book to evade limits on outside income from speaking
fees.
   Asked whether he would donate any excess earnings to charity if
the committee asked him to do so to correct the situation, Wright
said, ``Of course I'd do it.''
   The committee leaders arrived in San Antonio Monday to interview
witnesses as to how the Wright-Mallick partnership made a one-day
profit of $340,880 last May 10 on the oil well investment.
   The committee is studying ``the amount of profit over a few
hours' time,'' Myers said. ``It doesn't look good.''
   The ethics committee said it wanted to determine whether Wright
knew about the oil well deal, which involved the Jaffes, a West
German-owned firm, and the blind trust established for Wright in
1987, said Richard Phelan, the ethics committee's counsel.
   Dixon and Myers declined to say whether they would seek contempt
citations against the reluctant witnesses.
   Asked if he was upset, Myers said, ``Yes, we came down here to
Texas to expedite this, and find they are less than cooperative.''
   ``There is a possibility we will'' return to San Antonio, Dixon
said.
   The operator of the southeast Texas oil well, L.R. Brammer Jr.
of Brammer Engineering Co., was interviewed Monday.
   A Beaumont oil man told the Beaumont Enterprise the oil well in
question was located in an area of what he termed ``spotty
production'' in Sabine Lake.
   The wildcat venture was in an area that yielded few natural gas
wells and mostly dry ones, said Geneos ``Pete'' Cokinos, a
petroleum and geological consultant.
   Wright has denied any wrongdoing and pledged to fight the
allegations. Of the 1988 oil well transaction, Wright has said his
financial holdings were in a blind trust and he was unaware of the
deal.
   The panel is considering whether there is ``clear and
convincing'' proof of the 69 alleged violations and, if so, whether
to recommend disciplinary action to the House.

   A strong earthquake shook Mexico City and
other parts of southern Mexico this morning, cracking buildings and
sending thousands of panicked people into the streets. At least one
death was reported.
   Ambulances raced around the capital, sirens blaring, after the
8:29 a.m. (10:29 a.m. EDT) tremor.
   The government news agency Notimex reported one man was
electrocuted and died and that two women were seriously injured
when they jumped from the second story of a swaying building during
the tremor. The death and injuries occurred in Mexico City, the
agency said.
   The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,
said preliminary readings indicated the quake registered 6.8 on the
Richter scale.
   The epicenter was 40 miles east of Acapulco, about 200 miles
south of Mexico City, seismologist John Minsch said.
   The tremor was felt strongly in Acapulco, causing brief power
failures and panic, said Francisco Guerra, advertising director of
the newspaper Novedades de Acapulco.
   ``I've never felt a tremor so strong in the city and I've lived
here for 30 years. I thought the building would collapse,'' he said.
   Miguel Angel Hernandez, spokesman for the Guerrero state
government, said ``there are no reports of loss of life or major
damage throughout the state,'' including heavily populated Pacific
Ocean tourist spots such as Zijuatanejo and Acapulco.
   ``Even though the quake was intensively felt, everything is
normal and there are also reports of no major damage. We did a
survey by radio,'' he said.
   In Mexico City, the earthquake began as a small jolt and stopped
momentarily, then buildings in the capital began swaying back and
forth, with plaster cracking.
   The tremor shook Mexico City at about the same time as the large
earthquake that struck in Sept. 19, 1985, killing at least 10,000
people and knocking down hundreds of buildings. That quake measured
8.1 on the Richter scale.
   Today's earthquake knocked out power and telephone service in
some parts of Mexico City and damaged water lines. Schools were
evacuated to check for damage.
   Many buildings in the capital were evacuated.
   The temblor cut off power to Televisa, the nation's largest
television network, for a few minutes.
   Service in Mexico City's subway stopped temporarily to check for
damage on the lines.
   A 19-story building that houses the Health Ministry's budget
office suffered considerable damage as plaster fell, according to
evacuees. The building had been rebuilt after the 1985 quake.
   Carlos Bravo, who works in the penthouse offices, said, ``It was
horrible. There was hysteria. Parts of the ceiling fell, but they
were not big enough to hurt anyone. Some of us calmed many people
and made them go down the stairway.''
   Associated Press correspondents reported broken windows and
panic in neighborhoods around the capital, including Polanco,
Condesa and Napoles.
   In Condesa, a resident said she heard ``cracking sounds,'' saw
``people running into the streets'' and ``could see the earth
moving.''
   Radio Red reported that a police helicopter spotted no collapsed
buildings.
   Eduardo Almeida waited in a park outside his office in the
Condesa neighborhood. ``When there's an earthquake, there can be
another one afterwards,'' he said.
   An office worker who gave her name only as Magdalena, said, ``It
sounded like hail was falling. It sounded really ugly, as if the
building was breaking.''
   Jesus Esquivel, a carpenter working on fourth floor of modern
apartment building that was damaged in 1985 quake, sat in the park,
his tools by his side. ``The apartment where I'm working cracked.''
He said there was a small separation where the wall joins the
ceiling.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated
areas. A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake,
capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.
   Today's quake was centered about 250 miles southeast of the 1985
earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey in Washington said. The
agency said the earlier earthquake released 90 times more energy
than today's quake.
   An earthquake with a magnitude 5.9 was reported on July 15,
1987, 100 miles east of today's earthquake.

   The government moved Tuesday to halt a 9-day-old
student protest for democracy and a free press, urging them to go
back to class and disband their fledgling unions, and warning
workers to stay on the job.
   In a harsh editorial, read on the televised nightly news and
hourly on the radio, the Communist Party called for a swift end to
the student movement, the biggest since the revolution of 1949.
   ``This is a grave political struggle facing the whole party and
Chinese citizens,'' the editorial said. ``This is a planned
conspiracy that ... aims at negating the leadership of the party
and the socialist system.''
   It called the student unions illegal and said new demonstrations
would be suppressed. The unions were set up this week to replace
the state-run student organizations.
   ``This is their first step,'' said a Beijing University student
as the editorial was played repeatedly over loudspeakers on campus.
``We can expect arrests to come soon.''
   Students and student leaders said they would defy the editorial.
   ``It makes me sick to hear this,'' said one student at Beijing
Normal University, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``This is
just this kind of propaganda and lies we are fighting.'
   At least 50,000 students have boycotted class since the strike
began Monday. They plan to maintain the boycott at least until May
4, the 70th anniversary of China's first pro-democracy student
movement.
   They also said they would persist in calling for talks with the
government to discuss demands for a free press, more funds for
education and the publication of the financial records of China's
leaders. Many also want senior leaders such as Premier Li Peng and
Deng Xiaoping to resign.
   About 10,000 soldiers from a special force for suppressing civic
disturbances took up positions in many buildings near university
campuses, students and Chinese sources said.
   Police and agents from the Ministry of Security also occupied
apartments in the univerity area, the northwest corner of Beijing,
sources said.
   The government took steps to keep workers from supporting the
two-day student class boycott, warning them that sympathy strikes
would not be tolerated.
   ``I'm all for what the students are demanding,'' said a worker
reading a poster on the street outside Beijing University. ``I
really think the government is no good.''
   Another worker, who used his lunch break to hear speeches by
university students, said ``many workers are sympathetic to the
students, but they don't dare take part.''
   He said his factory and others were given orders to keep the
workers in line.
   Many workers back the student movement because of its criticism
of corruption, which runs rampant in China's state-run factories.
   The students also have won sympathy among many journalists,
whose state-controlled publications have been barred from
publishing news of the class boycott. Only two newspapers have
mentioned the student marches for democracy.
   Authorities banned this week's edition of the Shanghai-based
World Economic Herald after it apparently printed material critical
of the government.
   Universities throughout Beijing also tried to force the tens of
thousands of striking students back to class. Some schools
threatened students with expulsions. Others issued warnings of
unspecified punishment.
   The protest is the latest in a series of student actions
triggered by the April 15 death of ousted Communist Party chief Hu
Yaobang. Hu was purged after he was accussed of being too soft on
students during pro-democracy protests in 1986-87.
   On Friday and Saturday, about 150,000 people marched to
Tiananmen Square in one of the biggest protests since the communist
victory in 1949. The demonstrations are the clearest rejection yet
by Chinese students of the communist system.
   For the first time Tuesday, bands of students ventured into the
city's center to distribute leaflets calling for democracy, freedom
and a free press. They positioned themselves outside the railroad
station and at two busy intersections with collection boxes and
microphones to persuade their countrymen of the righteousness of
their cause.
   ``Comrades, our struggle is just beginning and we must have your
support,'' yelled a bespectacled physics student at the Xidan
intersection. ``We are fighting for a new China. Down with
corruption and dictatorship.''

   Eight U.S. servicemen were remembered for
their sacrifice Tuesday, nine years after they died in a desert in
Iran while trying to rescue American hostages.
   On a brilliant, blue morning on a hillside in Arlington National
Cemetery, the men who died at Desert One were honored in a ceremony
by friends, family and some of those they were trying to save.
   ``They gave their lives trying to secure my freedom _ that is
the ultimate sacrifice,'' said former Navy Chief Warrant Officer
Joe Hall, one of the 52 Americans who were taken hostage in Tehran
Nov. 3, 1979, by Iranians and held for 444 days.
   The rescue mission was attempted by an all-volunteer military
team on April 25, 1980. After the mission was abandoned, three
Marines and five Air Force servicemen died when a helicopter and a
transport plane collided in Iran's Great Salt Desert.
   Six former hostages, including former Ambassador Bruce Laingen,
joined relatives of the dead servicemen for the ceremony sponsored
by No Greater Love, a humanitarian organization that aids the
families of victims of war and terrorism.
   They placed a wreath at a marker honoring the eight soldiers,
and three yellow roses at the nearby grave of the three who are
buried together at Arlington.
   ``This is a wonderful ceremony _ it makes me feel better,'' said
Elizabeth Price of Bethesda, Md., aunt of Sgt. John D. Harvey of
Roanoke, Va., who at age 21 was the youngest of those killed on the
mission.
   ``I'm very proud of him,'' she said. ``He gave his life for
these men and the country. He was dedicated to what he was doing at
the Marines. He believed in them.''
   Charles Whitehouse, assistant secretary of defense for special
operations and low-intensity conflict, said the deaths reminded the
nation that ``the courage to try must be matched by the capability
to succeed.''
   ``Here we were found wanting,'' he said, adding that the
military since then has improved special forces preparedness.

   About 20,000 people lined up Tuesday to visit the
ancient pyramid of Gaius Cestius in Rome, which was opened to the
public for the first time in three centuries.
   Many people stood on line for three hours to get a glimpse of
the interior of the 88-foot-tall tomb of Roman official Gaius
Cestius, built in 12 B.C. as part of the wall surrounding Rome.
   Italy's Culture Ministry opened the monument for only one day to
mark the holiday commemorating the country's liberation by the
Allies in World War II.
   In the past, the pyramid has been open by special appointment
only.
   Laura Venditelli, an archaeological expert who supervises the
monument, said it was unlikely the pyramid would be opened again
any time soon.
   ``It is not repeatable because of problems with conserving the
monument, which today is subjected to a great amount of stress,''
she said.

   The Commerce Department said Tuesday it has
made a preliminary determination that martial arts uniforms from
Taiwan are being sold in the United States at less than fair value.
   As a result of the finding, cash deposits or bonds to offset the
price advantage will be imposed on the imported uniforms, which
include tops, pants and belts.
   If the preliminary finding is upheld and the U.S. International
Trade Commission determines that the lower-priced imports harm U.S.
manufacturers, the Customs Service will be instructed to collect
the final anti-dumping duties.
   The investigation began last November, when Century Martial Art
Supply Inc. filed a petition on behalf of the U.S. industry.
   Imports of martial arts uniforms from Taiwan totaled $1.2
million in 1988.

<HEAD>Pilot Project Begun to Provide Up to $100 Million for Elderly Housing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal National Mortgage Association said
Tuesday it is beginning a pilot project aimed at providing up to
$100 million for creative home mortgages for the elderly.
   The program is aimed at making housing more available and
affordable for the elderly with mortgages that reduce housing costs
or allow senior citizens to supplement their income by taking
advantage of the equity in their current homes.
   Vice President David P. Riordan said Fannie Mae would encourage
lenders to offer these mortgages to the elderly and commit to
buying up to $100 million in the mortgages on the secondary market.
Fannie Mae, which is congressionally chartered, is the nation's
largest investor in home mortgages.
   The program will provide mortgages for: accessory apartments
within a single-family home, which an elderly person could then
rent for extra income; temporary housing units built on a family
member's property; homes shared by a senior citizen and one or more
other adults; and the sale of a home by an elderly person to a
family member or investor who then rents it back to the seller.
   David O. Maxwell, Fannie Mae chairman, said it will alter
underwriting standards as part of the project, permitting lower
down payments on certain types of mortgages and including net
rental income as part of a borrower's qualifying income.
   Riordan said the loans are offered now on a sporadic basis if at
all, and that Fannie Mae hopes to encourage the availablility of
the loans and determine which are most successful. He said the $100
million represents a ``significant commitment'' to elderly housing.
To qualify, a person must be 62 or older.

   The Supreme Court, in a ruling welcomed in
Western states, said Tuesday states may tax businesses for oil and
gas extracted from Indian reservations.
   In a 6-3 decision in a case from New Mexico, the justices said
such taxes neither illegally infringe on the rights of Indians nor
do they amount to illegal multiple taxation.
   The court upheld New Mexico's authority to tax oil and gas taken
from the Jicarilla Apache reservation there. The levies were
challenged by Cotton Petroleum Inc., which also pays taxes to the
tribe for the extracted minerals.
   ``Today's ruling is a substantial and rather profound victory
for the state of New Mexico,'' said Gov. Garrey Carruthers.
   New Mexico collects about $19 million a year in such so-called
severance taxes from oil and gas and coal production on Indian land
in New Mexico.
   The court ruling also is good news for officials in Arizona,
Montana and Utah. There are some 150 cases in the four states in
which businesses with Indian mining leases say they are victims of
illegal multiple taxation _ by a state and a tribe.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, rejected
arguments that the New Mexico tax interferes with tribal economic
development by prompting producers to look off Indian reservations
for mineral deposits.
   He said a 1938 federal law, the Indian Mineral Leasing Act, does
not specifically pre-empt the power of states to tax oil and gas on
Indian lands.
   ``Any impairment to the federal policy favoring the exploitation
of on-reservation oil and gas resources by Indian tribes ... is
simply too indirect and too insubstantial to support'' a claim the
state tax is pre-empted, Stevens said.
   He also said that Cotton Petroleum, which has a lease with the
Apaches for oil and gas on the reservation, is not subject to
unfair double taxation.
   ``It is, of course, true that the total taxes paid by Cotton are
higher than those paid by off-reservation producers,'' he said.
``But neither the state nor the tribe imposes a discriminatory tax.
The burdensome consequence is entirely attributable to the fact
that the leases are located in an area where two governmental
entities share jurisdiction.''
   The high court in 1982 ruled that the Jicarilla Apaches may
impose their own severance tax on oil and gas extracted from their
reservation.
   Stevens noted Tuesday that New Mexico provides services to
Cotton Petroleum on the reservation.
   There is no constitutional requirement that the services the
company receives be equal in value to the amount of taxes it pays,
Stevens added.
   The Constitution does not demand that ``benefits received from a
tax authority by an ordinary commercial taxpayer ... must equal the
amount of its tax obligations,'' he said.
   Finally, Stevens said, the Apache tribe is not a ``state,'' and
therefore Cotton Petroleum is not subject to multiple state
taxation.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said New
Mexico is increasing its revenue ``at the expense of tribal
economic development.'' That violates federal policy, expressed in
laws and regulations, to protect Indian self-determination, he said.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall.
   Cotton Petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some
15,000 acres of land on the Jicarilla Apache reservation.
   The company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percent
of its production, and New Mexico levies taxes on the company
amounting to 8 percent of its production.
   Cotton Petroleum noted that oil and gas producers in the state
with deposits taken from non-Indian land only pay 8 percent in
taxes.
   The company said it paid $2.3 million in taxes to New Mexico
from 1981 through 1985 but received only $89,000 in services from
the state.
   The Jicarilla tribe was not a direct participant in the case. It
filed a friend-of-the-court brief expressing its opposition to the
state taxes.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Upheld a 1986 federal law imposing ``safety user fees'' on
pipeline companies that transport natural gas and hazardous
liquids. In a case from Oklahoma, the court said the law does not
give the executive branch too much of Congress' power to impose
taxes.
   _Tossed out a dispute from Minnesota over the federal
government's power to ban newspapers from publishing lists of
winners in privately run lotteries. The court said the case is moot
because the government no longer intends to enforce the ban.

   A computer hacker with a sense of honor
padded the dean's list at Valley College with such names as Wratha
Kahn, Gray Poupon, Hans Zoff, Roger Overndowt and Warren Peese.
   Seventy names added to the list published in the school
newspaper included Betty Crocker, Dee Generet, Rex Karrs, Claire D.
Aisle and about 25 real students.
   ``I personally feel it's insulting,'' said Lisa Walker, student
body president-elect, a sophomore who made the list the hard way.
``People work hard to be on the dean's list. It's not just a little
thing to me.''
   Making the list requires at least a 3.6 grade-point average out
of 4.0.
   The list apparently was doctored after it arrived at the
newspaper.
   ``We took the dean's list that was submitted to us and typed it
into the computer and proofread it a couple of times and stored it
on the disk,'' said editor Dean Hotta. ``About 15 or 20 people know
how to operate the machines. I haven't the slightest clue who did
it.''
   Gloria E. Miranda, an assistant dean, said President Mary Lee
may address the tampering at a Wednesday tea for the honorees.
However, dean's list No. 375 won't be there. His name is Dean Slist.

   Buffalo are more at home on the range, a
doctor has decided after five years of dealing with problems caused
by the freedom-loving American bison.
   Following a weekend in which seven fugitive buffalo had to be
killed after causing two accidents on Florida's Turnpike, Arnold
Oper has decided to sell all 60 remaining animals. They should go
for about $2,000 each, said his attorney Ron Lowy.
   That decision doesn't come soon enough for Greg Hintz, whose
1981 Chevrolet sustained $2,000 damage when he collided in the dark
with a group of four bison wandering across the highway Saturday
night.
   ``I was so mad that those things got on the turnpike,'' Hintz
said.
   Oper, south Florida's only buffalo rancher, was still trying
Tuesday to corral some of the 50 bison that escaped from his
Chi-O-Ranchero near the Dade-Broward county line. He has been
raising the animals for meat.
   Lowy said they have most of the remaining herd in a rock quarry,
but the bison keep swimming away into a lake every time wranglers
get near.

<DATELINE>EUGENE, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a tavern in Coburg, there's ``pickled
spotted owl egg'' and ``fried or broasted spotted owl'' on the menu.
   An Oakridge tavern held a spotted owl dinner two weeks ago, and
attracted a big crowd.
   A Springfield man plans to market ``spotted owl jerky.''
   The food isn't really owl meat, but the spoofs are signs of how
high emotions are running in Oregon's timber country over the
northern spotted owl and its habitat in old-growth forest coveted
by loggers.
   Bill Allison, publisher of High Lead magazine in Eugene, said
he's sold more than 600 T-shirts that feature a hairy logger
carrying an owl on a tray with the caption ``save a logger, eat an
owl.''
   Despite the protestations, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
said today in Washington, D.C., it will tell a federal court in
Seattle next week that protection of the spotted owl as a
threatened species is warranted.
   Listing a species as ``threatened'' is slightly less restrictive
than listing a species as ``endangered,'' said George Leonard,
associate chief of the U.S. Forest Service. However, it still could
lock loggers out of much of the old-growth forest west of the
Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service earlier decided against listing
the owl as endangered, but a reassessment was ordered by U.S.
District Judge Thomas Zilly in Seattle. Zilly found the earlier
decision was not supported by evidence compiled by Fish and
Wildlife.
   Under the Endangered Species Act, a species is considered
endangered if it is ``in danger of extinction throughout all or a
significant part of its range.'' A species is considered threatened
if it is ``likely to become an endangered species in the
foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its
range.''
   Rolla Anderson, who works at the Bohemia Inc. plywood plant in
Vaughn, has written a poem about the owl. In it, he tells of a man
seeing a spotted owl contentedly sitting on a limb in a stand of
old-growth trees.
   ``Even tho I soon may lose my job
   And stand to lose my home
   I can't explain the peace I felt
   Like none I've never known.
   Standing there in that quiet place
   Far from the sound of cars
   I looked around, took careful aim
   Then blew his brains to Mars.''
   Environmentalists who say the owl is faced with extinction
because of logging, and timber industry representatives who say the
trees are needed to keep the industry alive in the Northwest, agree
that the spotted owl dinners, T-shirts and poems are signs of
frustration and fear.
   Karen Wood of the environmental group Earth First said anti-owl
sentiment has been caused by the timber industry.
   ``They find it convenient to turn their workers' heads around
and say, `Look, it's that owl that's taking your job,' when they're
sending logs overseas,'' she said.
   ``It's just a fear thing and I hope workers can look beyond the
fear to see what's happenning.''
   Allison said he's received only one complaint about his
T-shirts. That came from a timber industry official who said the
shirts are inappropriate and thought it would be better to show an
owl or other wildlife living in harmony with good forest practices.
   Allison accuses both sides of ``tunnel vision.''
   ``The spotted owl is a means to an end,'' he said. ``If it
wasn't that, it would be the pig-tailed titmouse. The
(environmentalists') goal is to save old growth.''
   As for the timber industry, he said, ``How can people like
Weyerhaeuser send (logs) to Japan, then go bid on federal timber?
That's not fair.''
   Anderson said he really doesn't advocate shooting spotted owls,
but he lost his job in California when Redwood National Park was
established.
   ``I just kind of got a new start and I'd hate to see it go down
the tubes here,'' he said.
   ``I'm not so dumb that I think the owl is the only problem,'' he
said. ``They're shipping logs (overseas), I realize that. There
might be a poem coming on that one of these days.''
   ``The owl gets focused on,'' he said, ``because it's kind of a
symbol.''

revealing that he could live in the lap of luxury anyway because he
hit a multimillion-dollar Lotto jackpot.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered the city to
build a $32 million high school to attract white suburban students
into a mostly black area as part of a desegregation plan.
   ``It will be the most phenomenal high school facility in the
nation,'' said Arthur A. Benson II, attorney for the plaintiffs in
the school desegregation case.
   It would cost twice as much as an average high school and
include whirlpool baths, racquetball and handball courts and a
50-meter indoor swimming pool.
   The state, which would pay much of the cost of building and
equipping the Central High School, opposed the order, arguing that
the athletic facilities proposed were extravagant.
   ``Although the Central design is more extensive than any other
high school in the Kansas City area, such facilities are necessary
to attract non-minority suburban students to the inner city to
accomplish the difficult task of desegregating Central High
School,'' said the order from U.S. District Judge Russell G. Clark.
   Clark's order was dated April 20 and received Monday by the
Kansas City School Board.

<HEAD>Employment Costs Fuel Inflationary Pressures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wages and salaries paid American workers in
private industry rose 4.2 percent in the last 12 months, the
biggest jump in 3{ years, the government said Tuesday in a report
that showed increasing inflationary pressures from tight labor
markets.
   But the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index and other
economic reports issued Tuesday brought mixed predictions of
whether a recession is inevitable or could be averted by slower
growth in the record seventh year of the economy's expansion.
   Economist David Wyss of Data Resources Inc., noting a number of
recent reports that point to a slowdown in economic expansion, said
he believed growth had eased enough to convince the Federal Reserve
Board that further credit tightening would not be needed to fight
inflation.
   Wyss said credit-tightening already done by the Federal Reserve
may be enough to postpone a recession for up to two years.
   ``It's sort of like death: You can't cure it, you can only
postpone it,'' Wyss said. ``I don't think we've solved the problems
of the business cycle.''
   But chief economist Allen Sinai of Boston Co. Economic Advisers
Inc. said he was looking for the next downturn to begin within a
year as inflationary pressures mount.
   ``What is happening is that wages and salaries are picking up
because of the tight labor market. I think there is an increasingly
embedded upward tilt in wage compensation and overall employment
costs,'' Sinai said. ``There is a recession in there somewhere.''
   Others, however, predicted that inflation would ease as the
economy slows to a sustainable pace and that the Federal Reserve
then would ease its tight hold on credit to help the economy into a
``soft landing.''
   ``I don't think we're headed to a recession,'' said Paine Webber
economist Maury Harris. ``The Fed's going to be able to head this
thing off at the pass before it gets out of hand.''
   In other economic news Tuesday:
   _The government reported that orders to U.S. factories for ``big
ticket'' durable goods rose a moderate 0.8 percent in March after
two months of big declines, reflecting a rebound in orders for
transportation equipment. Excluding that volatile category, orders
were down for the third straight month, declining 2.8 percent.
   ``The evidence is mounting that the economy has slowed down,''
Data Resources economist Roger Brinner said of that report.
   _The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
homes dropped for the third straight month in March to the slowest
pace in more than a year. That news came a week after the
government reported the second straight monthly decline of new-home
construction. Both declines are blamed on rising mortgage rates.
   ``First-time buyers are simply locked out of the market by
unaffordable financing,'' said Ira Gribin, president of the
Realtors.
   _The Labor Department reported that major collective bargaining
settlements reached in private industry in the first quarter
provided for average wage increases of 3.1 percent over the life of
the contracts. That figure was up from average annual wage gains of
2.2 percent in contracts settled in the preceding quarter.
   Taken together, analysts said that the four reports contained
few surprises but confirmed that inflation continues to grow as the
economy slows.
   ``If labor costs are rising, and this data shows that they are,
price inflation can hardly be less than that, it has to be more,''
said Sinai.
   Said Wyss: ``I think all the reports are basically good news for
the Fed,'' which has been trying to slow growth to ease inflation.
He said the wage gains were higher than the central bank would
prefer but added, ``It's hard to panic about it.''
   The 4.2 percent increase in private-sector wages and salaries in
the year ending March 31 was the highest 12-month jump since a 4.8
percent advance reported for the year ending Sept. 30, 1985.
   It followed an equally disturbing 4.1 percent rise in wages for
the 12 months ending in December. By comparison, wages had risen
3.3 percent for the year ending in March 1988.
   Overall private-industry employment costs, which include
benefits paid by employers in addition to wages and salaries, rose
4.6 percent over the last 12 months, compared to 3.9 percent in the
preceding year.
   ``There is unequivocal evidence of a gradual upward movement in
labor costs,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, executive vice president and
chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.
   The Employment Cost Index is closely watched because it gives a
broad view of possible inflationary pressures on business costs.
   For the first quarter, overall compensation costs in private
industry rose 1.3 percent, up from 1.0 percent in the final quarter
of 1988 but down from the 1.5 percent increase in the first quarter
a year ago, when a 5 percent rise in Social Security taxes boosted
benefit costs.
   Workers in the fast-growing service-producing industries
received average wage and salary increases of 5.1 percent over the
last 12 months, compared to average 3.1 percent pay gains by
workers in goods-producing jobs, the Labor Department said.
   The rate of wage gains for non-union workers continued to
outpace pay increases for union workers, although wages for union
workers remain higher.

<HEAD>State Department Criticizes Soviets, Mounts Campaign Within NATO
To Bar Talks</HEAD>

   The United States accused the Soviet Union on
Tuesday of trying to undermine NATO's nuclear defense and
instructed U.S. ambassadors in Western capitals to counter a West
German drive for negotiations to scale back short-range nuclear
missiles.
   The U.S. offensive is designed to rally the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization against any reduction in nuclear battlefield
weapons before President Bush meets with the 15 allied leaders in
Brussels at the end of May.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, trying to counter growing
support for disarmament in his country, sent Defense Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher to
Washington for talks Monday to try to persuade the Bush
administration tn negotiate with the Soviets over the missiles.
   But Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III turned the West Germans down, saying it would be
a mistake to risk cutbacks in the short-range nuclear missiles and
artillery guns that fire nuclear-tipped shells while the Soviets
held an advantage in non-nuclear forces in Europe.
   Cheney described such negotiations as a ``dangerous trap.'' But
Kohl, whose political future could hinge on the missile issue, is
not backing off and will present his position formally to the West
German parliament on Thursday.
   In the meantime, the State Department sent cables to the
American ambassadors in all the NATO capitals instructing them to
present the U.S. argument against negotiations to the foreign
ministries there, a U.S. official said.
   The presentations, known technically as ``demarches,'' are
designed to forestall a drift toward the West German position,
which already enjoys some support in Norway, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Denmark.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said West
German ambassadors were expected to mount a campaign for support in
all NATO capitals as well.
   Also, Rozanne L. Ridgway, the assistant secretary of state for
European affairs, will present the U.S. position to senior
officials of Spain, Greece and France in Madrid on May 16.
   That is two weeks before Bush and the leaders of the NATO
countries hold a summit meeting in Brussels.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said ``it
would be helpful'' if the missile dispute could be resolved before
the meeting. ``There is more to discuss at the summit than SNF
(short-range nuclear forces),'' she said.
   But Ms. Tutwiler, who consulted with Baker, said ``the
discussions will continue'' and launched into an attack on the
Soviet Union.
   ``The Soviets clearly want to denuclearize and undermine NATO's
flexible response and forward-defense strategies,'' she said.
``Negotiations would provide them an opportunity to promote a third
zero.''
   The battlefield nuclear missiles are considered part of a
flexible strategy designed to keep the Soviets off-balance. The
theory is that uncertainty whether NATO would use nuclear weapons
deters a Soviet attack.
   The 1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear
missiles eliminated two categories of nuclear rockets in Europe.
This is known as the `'double-zero.''
   The statement read by Ms. Tutwiler at Baker's direction refers
to a third category of missiles _ those with a range below 315
miles _ and U.S. determination to keep them in Europe.
   ``The Soviets have already modernized their nuclear weapons, and
the alliance must also maintain up-to-date forces,'' she said.

   Palestinian attackers on Tuesday stabbed to
death two men accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities,
Arab reports said.
   The deaths in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip follow a
call by Palestinian uprising leaders for attacks on Arabs
cooperating with Israel and an order by Moslem fundamentalists to
target drug dealers and prostitutes.
   Authorities confirmed one of the deaths.
   A Palestinian also was reported shot and killed Tuesday in a
clash with soldiers in the Gaza Strip, and 17 others were wounded
by army gunfire in the occupied territories, including a
13-year-old girl who was shot in the head.
   Army officials said they were unaware of the death and were
checking reports of clashes.
   In Jerusalem's Old City, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir declared
that Israel would never surrender part of Jerusalem in a peace
settlement with Palestinians. The government said Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens would visit the United States in May for talks on
Shamir's plan to hold elections in the occupied territories to
advance the stalled peace process.
   Police said they had arrested three suspects in Tuesday's fatal
stabbing of Fauzi Muhareb in the Gaza town of Khan Yunis.
   Muhareb, 51, left his house accompanied by his wife, said police
spokesman Yigal Golan. ``There was a roadblock of burning tires.
Three to four young men ... attacked him with knives. They stabbed
him in the shoulder and heart.''
   Police said Muhareb had a criminal background but would not give
details.
   Palestinian reporters, who insisted on anonymity, said Muhareb
was a collaborator with Israel and a drug dealer.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Azam Al-Qadi was beaten and
stabbed to death early Tuesday, Arab reporters said. Al-Qadi, 21,
was accused by local Palestinians of giving information to the Shin
Bet security service, the Arabs said.
   The PLO-backed leadership of the 16-month Palestinian uprising
has repeatedly called for attacks on collaborabors. In its latest
leaflet, it declared Wednesday ``a day of accounting for the
collaborators.''
   In February, a leaflet from the fundamentalist Moslem movement
Hamas, or ``Zeal,'' urged Palestinians to ``deal with'' prostitutes
and drug dealers.
   Within the past week, five alleged collaborators were reported
killed in the occupied territories, but at least two victims were
also said to have criminal connections.
   Including Tuesday's deaths, 447 Palestinians and 18 Israelis
have been killed in the uprising.
   The latest victim was Khalid Musa Armelat, 22, who was shot in
the head during a clash with soldiers in the Gaza town of Rafah,
according to officials at nearby Nasser Hospital.
   A member of Israel's parliament meanwhile demanded an
investigation into an allegation that an army colonel bragged about
subverting an inquiry into the killing of a Palestinian by soldiers.
   Dedi Zucker of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement said he
was told by a reserve soldier that during a briefing, the colonel
was asked what would happen to someone who shot a Palestinian.
   The reservist told Zucker that the colonel replied: ``Listen, I
have an example for you. Two weeks ago a Palestinians was shot at
close range and when the investigators came, we arranged it so
there would be no problem.''
   Zucker said he wrote Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin three weeks
ago to ask for an investigation into the death in the West Bank
village of Deir Pazia but received no reply.
   Eitan Haber, a Rabin spokesman, said he was uncertain if the
letter was received.

   The United States on Tuesday disputed a
suggestion by Prime Minister David Lange of New Zealand that his
country may pull out of a security alliance with the United States
because of his nation's anti-nuclear policies.
   ``That is New Zealand's prerogative,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. But, she added, ``we take exception
to the prime minister's assertions that such action is justified by
the United States' refusal to consult with New Zealand'' in
accordance with terms of the ANZUS pact.
   ANZUS, created in 1951 as a defense alliance among the United
States, Australia and New Zealand, has been crippled since the
United States suspended guarantees for New Zealand's defense in
1986 over the Pacific nation's ban of ships carrying nuclear
weapons. U.S. policy is neither to confirm nor deny the existence
of nuclear weapons on its vessels.
   Even if New Zealand does pull out, ``ANZUS would continue to
exist as the foundation of our important and active security
relationship with Australia,'' said a State Department statement.
   ``We continue to hope that New Zealand will reassess its
anti-nuclear policies, which would enable it to return to full
participation'' in ANZUS, the statement said.
   The rift between the two countries led the United States to stop
sharing intelligence information with New Zealand and to cool its
diplomatic relations with the embassy here.
   Speaking at Yale University Monday, Lange said his country's
security relationship with the United States is a ``dead letter.''
   But the State Department disputed that view, saying that ``the
U.S. continues to maintain a security relationship with New
Zealand, albeit much diminished from the close military and
intelligence ties existing prior to the current dispute.''
   Observers here have noted that despite Lange's outspoken
comments at Yale and in several interviews he has granted since
arriving for a six-day visit, he has also emphasized that overall
relations between the two countries are good. Lange has stressed
that trade and tourism have grown.
   Responding to that tone, the State Department said ``the United
States and New Zealand now enjoy a constructive relationship on a
range of issues in which we share common goals and objectives.
   ``We regret, however, that the prime minister's remarks did not
more constructively address our difference of opinion on issues
raised by New Zealand's anti-nuclear policies,'' it said.
   Lange said Monday he would not come to Washington because the
U.S. administration had made it clear he was not welcome until his
government renounced its anti-nuclear policies.

<HEAD>Four Months After Rationing Ends, Shortages Start</HEAD>
<UNK>By DRUSILLA MENAKER ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday that a severe
gas shortage has closed some stations and caused long lines at the
pumps, forcing Poland to look to the West for extra gas supplies.
   The government blamed a 20 percent jump in gasoline consumption
on the end of gas rationing Jan. 1, a mild winter that allowed more
cars on the road and the government's refusal to allow prices to
rise high enough to discourage demand.
   ``If we were persistent in introducing the market economy,
prices would surely regulate the problem of lines,'' said deputy
government spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowski.
   Concern about gas shortages and price increases began spreading
across Warsaw by word of mouth last week.
   Confirmation came Tuesday in official newspaper reports the
government would tap hard currency supplies to buy about 163
million gallons of gasoline from Sweden, Austria and East Germany.
   Gas imports planned for the first half of this year from the
Soviet Union, Poland's largest supplier, arrived early and were
used up ahead of schedule, the Express Wieczorny newspaper reported
Tuesday.
   It will be several weeks before the new gas reaches Poland and
eases the supply problems, said Krzysztof Pilich, deputy manager of
the state oil department.
   But Pilich said rationing would not be introduced again.
   When rationing ended, the Ministry of Industry warned that
prices would increase if sales of gasoline outstripped supplies.
   The price at the time was 190 zlotys a liter, or $1.46 per
gallon. The price has been raised to 250 zlotys a liter.
   The average monthly salary is about $127 to $175.
   Disgruntled drivers waiting Tuesday at a Warsaw gas station had
differing opinions about the cause of the shortage, which is being
widely discussed in the informal network that keeps residents up to
date on supplies of goods.
   ``I think it is a matter of bad distribution,'' said one man.
   Another who had waited for four hours without success the night
before said he thought the government had created the shortage to
keep people from ``moving around the country'' during upcoming
elections, the first since 1947.
   ``I think it is done on purpose and a lot of people share this
view,'' he said.
   Rykowski said there could be some distribution problems but poor
planning did not cause the shortage. Instead, he said it stemmed
from a failure ``for justifiable, social reasons'' to use higher
prices to suppress demand in the style of a market-based economy.
   ``I am saying this with certain terror because I know that these
sorts of moralizing speeches are met with rejection,'' he said at
the news conference.
   ``I don't intend to continue this sermonizing and point out that
in countries with a market-oriented economy, when someone drives to
work he calculates how much that costs,'' he said.

   Activists said they canceled a
pro-independence rally Tuesday after authorities told them it could
spark a repeat of the bloody confrontation with soldiers in which
20 people died.
   ``There is a danger the tanks will charge again, and the
soldiers will shoot. So we postponed the meeting,'' said David
Nadiradze, a lawyer who advocates the secession of the republic of
Georgia from the Soviet Union.
   Nadiradze said independence activists received the warning from
sympathetic police officers, and political leaders advised that the
curfew and state of emergency that brought Soviet soldiers into the
city could be reinstated.
   About 5,000 people appeared at the flower-covered square in
front of Government House on Tuesday. Young people holding flowers,
candles or black flags of mourning guarded a shrine at the crash to
the victims of the April 9 clash.
   But no one stood up to address the group.
   Irakli Shengalaya, head of the Society of National Justice, an
informal political group, said he and other activists decided to
postpone the demonstration after Georgian Interior Minister Shota
Gorgodze warned earlier Tuesday that the curfew and state of
emergency that brought Soviet soldiers and tanks into the
republic's capital on April 7 could be reinstated.
   The soldiers and armor were withdrawn from the city last week,
but activist Tengiz Ordzhonikidze said they have been seen in
recent days at nearby lakes and in suburbs.
   Shengelaya and other activists said the interior minister's
statement, which was carried on local TV, appeared to be friendly
advice rather than a threat.
   Georgian Communist Party chief Givi Gumbaridze, when asked
Monday how he would react to future demonstrations, said: ``What
happened on April 9 can't happen again.''
   Gumbaridze on Monday confirmed accusations by activists that
some of the 20 deaths were caused by poison gas used by the
soldiers.
   In Washington, the United States on Tuesday condemned ``the use
of any chemical agents that cause serious injury or death when used
against peaceful protesters.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler urged the Soviet
government to ``investigate fully and openly what happened on April
9.''
   In Moscow, Georgy P. Razumovsky, a candidate member of the
ruling Communist Party Politburo who visited Tbilisi after the
violence, said the decision to break up the protest with force was
made ``by local authorities.''
   Razumovsky, at a news conference, criticized Georgian officials
for a ``constant lack of dialogue'' with young people and the
intelligentsia on the republic's problems.
   Activists said the demonstration, which had been planned for the
yard of the Kashveti Church, a 13th-century stone building across
the street from Government House, was postponed to May 21.
   Tiblisi Police Chief Roman Zvensadze said he had personally
suggested to activists that ``holding a demonstration during the
traditional 40 days of mourning would be unseemly.''
   The demonstration had been called to demand the release of seven
activists arrested hours after the April 9 clash and to ``demand
punishment of the murderers,'' said Nadiradze.
   They also sought were seeking annulment of a Kremlin decree
making it illegal to ``insult or discredit'' the government.
   Demonstrations in Georgia first began April 4 when protesters
criticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian
minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by
Georgians.
   Other protesters have demanded Georgia secede from the Soviet
Union because of alleged interference from the central government.
   The republic's senior party official, Dzhumber Patiashvili, took
responsibility for the April 9 attack and resigned.

   A new law requiring publishers and
distributors to document the ages of nude models in photographs
``will have a truly devastating effect'' on free expression and
will not stem the flow of child pornography, a judge was told
Tuesday.
   The law poses near-impossible record-keeping burdens on
legitimate businesses and would impose a ``corporate death
penalty'' on distributors because all assets could be seized if
they violate the law with even one publication, said an attorney
for a coalition of publishing and library groups.
   The coalition claims the law would force librarians to remove
from their shelves any medical, sex education and sociological
texts showing full frontal nudity and stop magazines and TV shows
from using adult sexual material that is protected by the First
Amendment.
   ``It will have a truly devastating effect on entirely lawful,
protected speech of adults,'' said Bruce Ennis, an attorney
representing the American Library Association in a lawsuit against
the statute.
   The law requires that anyone who produces material with images
of sexual activity or ``lascivious exhibition of the genitals''
keep records showing the models depicted are at least 18 years old.
The law covers the reissue of any materials produced after Feb. 5,
1978 _ the date when a major federal child pornography law took
effect.
   Ennis said the word lascivious is too imprecise, the text of the
statute is too broad and the child porno industry is entirely
underground and would not be affected by the law.
   ``The government is concerned about an underground problem, but
they impose a solution on a legitimate above-ground industry,''
Ennis said.
   Richard Stearns, a Justice Department attorney, told U.S.
District Judge George Revercomb that publishers' First Amendment
arguments were ``overwrought'' and that they would be little
affected by the law.
   He said if mainstream companies weren't distributing child
pornography it must mean they already have adopted ways to prevent
such occurrences.
   Stearns said the government has the right to try to stop the
production of ``vast'' amounts of child pornography in this country
and the importation of child pornography.
   The new law would punish criminals, not suppress free
expression, he told the judge.
   Then-President Reagan signed the Child Protection and Obscenity
Enforcement Act last November, and the record-keeping requirements
were scheduled to start May 17, not Aug. 17 as published
incorrectly in the Federal Register, Stearns said.
   The act increases penalties for anyone facilitating use of a
child for producing sexually explicit materials, creates a new
federal offense for engaging in the business of distributing
obscene materials and provides mandatory forfeiture of the profits
of those convicted of being engaged in the adult obscenity business.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, has said Congress intended to
target only major dealers or producers of obscene materials who
were ``knowingly engaged for a long period of time.'' He said the
measure was not aimed at the bookstore owner who may have a single
volume judged to be obscene.
   Stearns said the problem in prosecuting child pornography was
the difficulty in determining the ages of models. He agreed with
Revercomb that the issue involved those aged 14 to 17 who can pass
for 19 and 20, such as actress Tracy Lords who made 75 porno films
starting when she was 14.
   Stearns said the law clearly defines illegal sexual acts and
``doesn't apply to all frank depictions of the human form.''
Medical texts, art books and news photos would not be in jeopardy,
he said.
   Revercomb took under advisement the coalition's request for a
preliminary injunction against the record-keeping and forfeiture
provisions. The Justice Department sought dismissal of the suit.
   The challengers include the American Library Association,
American Booksellers Association, Freedom to Read Foundation,
Magazine Publishers of America, American Society of Magazine
Photographers, American Society of Magazine Editors, Council for
Periodical Distributors Association, International Periodical
Distributors Association and the Satellite Broadcasting
Communications Association.
   The Association of American Publishers and the Video Software
Dealers Association also filed court papers arguing against the law.

   A multimillion-dollar opera-ballet starring 8,000
dancers and musicians, 100 sheep, two elephants and a locomotive
will highlight July 14 celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the
storming of the Bastille prison.
   The parade, titled ``La Marseillaise,'' is sure to be ``powerful
and joyful,'' Culture Minister Jack Lang said Tuesday as he
presented the project to reporters.
   It is a two-hour spectacle that will begin under the recently
restored Arc de Triomphe and go the length of the Champs Elysees to
end dramatically at the Place de la Concorde. American diva Jessye
Norman will sing the French national anthem _ also titled ``La
Marseillaise'' _ behind a backdrop of water.
   ``Then the sheet of water will open like the Red Sea, and gather
up all the performers,'' said Jean-Paul Gouze, who created the show.
   The Florida Marching Band from Tallahassee will march backward,
dancing the ``moonwalk'' choreographed by Michael Jackson and
playing the tunes that made soul king James Brown famous. Tanks
with lights, sound and confetti will trail the band.
   About 1,500 drummers representing French regional cultures and
traditions will be dressed in sailor suits topped with flaming hats
shaped like birthday cakes, while musicians from Nevers in central
France keep tune with the sound of a chugging steam engine.
   Two hundred British bagpipers and drummers will think they never
left home as special effects recreate the thick London fog.
   Among others, China will be presented by dancers and martial
artists, African countries are providing zebras that will prance
behind women dancers, and Soviet acrobats will perform stunts under
a mock snowstorm and a giant skating rink evoking the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution.
   The musical score has been composed by Wally Badarou of Benin.
   Each egment has been conceived like ``a scene in a movie with
its own lighting and special effects,'' said Goude, who was rock
star Grace Jones' manager.
   He said ``La Marseillaise'' cost $15.6 million to produce and
will be broadcast worldwide to 100 million TV viewers.

   Vice President Dan Quayle,
decked out in sweet smelling leis, declared a national holiday
Tuesday for this tropical island where he was greeted by cheering
locals.
   ``You all look like happy campers to me,'' Quayle said as he
spoke to about 2,000 natives gathered for his brief stopover
enroute to Australia. Quayle had flown here from Hawaii, where he
had spent several hours playing basketball and paying his last
respects to Col. Nick Rowe, the U.S. military adviser killed last
week in the Philippines.
   Quayle put on a dark suit to enter the cargo plane which carried
Rowe's body to Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu. Declaring Rowe's
murder ``a cowardly act,'' Quayle said Rowe and other Americans
serve their country ``so we can have peace and freedom.''
   Leaving the plane in Pago Pago, the Quayles were greeted village
elders dressed in sarongs and carrying long walking sticks. About
2,000 school children waved small American flags and cheered as the
vice president and his wife, Marilyn, blotted sweat from their
brows in this tropical territory.
   After encouraging the Samoans to pursue their education, Quayle
said, ``I have the power to declare this a holiday _ you can have
the rest of the day off.''
   The crowd cheered with one man saying incredulously, ``It's a
public holiday.''

   Four environmental groups urged the Bush
administration Tuesday to phase out all ozone-destroying chemicals
by 1995, and said the government is courting disaster by proposing
to allow some production until the year 2000.
   ``None of the potential scenarios for protecting the ozone layer
which have been considered thus far'' by the government ``are
designed to do more than stabilize atmospheric chlorine
concentrations at 1985 levels,'' the groups said in a report.
   The 1985 levels, the report said, were more than enough to poke
a hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic, which appeared in the
late 1970s.
   It is the chlorine in chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons that
breaks down in the stratosphere, and destroys the earth's ozone
shield. Depletion of the ozone layer lets ultra-violet radiation
from te sun get through, increasing the risk of skin cancer and eye
disease, while threatening plant life on land and in water.
   The report was prepared by the U.S. Public Interest Research
group; the Institute for Energy and Environmental Studies; the
National Toxics Campaign, and the Clean Water Action Project. The
groups said they would knock on doors in 40 states and mobilize
local activist organizations to win support for an earlier phaseout
than currently planned.
   The U.S. government is part of the Montreal Protocol, the 1987
treaty that requires industrial nations to cut production of CFC's
to 50 percent of 1986 levels by 1999.
   The United States and the European Community have proposed going
further, calling for a ban on CFC production by the year 2000.
   The report called for a 50 percent cutback of CFC's and related
chemicals by 1991, and elimination of these chemicals _ plus
another ozone-depleter, carbon tetrachloride _ by 1995.
   The groups also proposed 1995 elimination of methyl chloroform,
which has similar destructive effects, with a five-year extension
if no safe alternative is available.
   U.S. chemical companies are now testing CFC substitutes, but
production is not expected for three-to-five years, according to
the industry.
   U.S. delegates to an international meeting of Montreal Protocol
signers next week are expected to warn that unrestricted use of
now-unregulated carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform could
offset the phaseout of CFC's in the treaty.
   Last week, EPA published a notice in the Federal Register that
the upcoming meeting, in Helsinki, is likely to propose that the
two chemicals be included in the protocol.
   The new environmental report said, ``The Montreal Protocol
agreement would allow stratospheric chlorine levels from human
emissions in the next 50 years to increase to a level four times
higher than the level ... that existed'' before the Antarctic ozone
hole was discovered.
   ``Even under EPA's strongest set of measures, by (the year) 2100
stratospheric chlorine levels from human emissions are projected to
remain higher'' than the level that caused the ozone hole, the
report added.
   ``In the long term, to allow atmospheric chlorine levels
anywhere near those which catalyzed the Antarctic hole is to court
disaster,'' the report said.
   CFC gases are used as computer solvents, refrigerants and
foam-blowing agents for insulation. Halons are used in
fire-fighting equipment. Carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform
are solvents used to clean machinery.

   Helmeted police detained at least three
people Tuesday at a noisy rally where an anti-communist
independence group announced candidates for upcoming elections to
the National Assembly.
   The Confederation for an Independent Poland said it will field
three candidates in Warsaw for the larger Sejm chamber in an effort
to weaken the communist system.
   Police vehicles lined the street in front of the gates to Warsaw
University, where the rally began.
   Then police wielding batons and metal shields moved in and
detained at least three people, including two confederation
members, when about 50 supporters ran into a police line.
   Confederation campus leader Wojciech Gawkowski announced that
he, Stanislaw Mazurkiewicz and Stanislaw Dronicz will run for the
Sejm.
   Anybody who gathers 3,000 signatures can run for one of the 161
seats available to independent candidates in the 460-member Sejm,
or a seat in the new 100-member Senate that will be the first
freely elected legislative body in the East bloc.
   Gawkowski said that if police do not stop interfering with
election efforts of the confederation, known by its Polish initials
KPN, the group will call for a boycott of the June voting.
   ``KPN will not stop organizing protests. We want to beat the
communist system down to its foundations,'' he told listeners.
   Authorities consider the confederation an illegal organization
and police regularly break up its rallies and meetings.
   Deputy government spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowski told reporters
Tuesday that confederation rallies are ``aggressive and rough,''
and ``contradictory with the spirit of conciliation.''
   Meanwhile, 1,500 supporters of the students' union NZS marched
across Warsaw to the Education Ministry to demand legal
registration of the independent group and improved conditions at
campuses. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday on legalizing the
union.

<HEAD>Curfew Ordered To Halt Violence Against Senegalese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gangs of angry Mauritanians armed
with sticks and clubs harassed Senegalese citizens and sacked their
shops Tuesday, forcing the government to impose a dusk-to-dawn
curfew.
   In the Senegalese capital of Dakar, 375 miles to the south,
anti-Mauritanian violence was not quelled until 4 a.m. Tuesday
after the army was called out and police resorted to tear gas.
   Both countries reinforced their troops along the Senegal River
border, as tensions mounted over a land dispute.
   Government officials in the two West African nations tried to
calm passions sparked by the April 9 killing of two Senegalese
farmers, allegedly shot by Mauritanian soldiers in Senegal's
Diawara border village. Two people have died in violence in Senegal
since then.
   Sporadic outbursts against Mauritanian shopkeepers in Dakar and
Senegalese in Nouakchott grew into widespread violence Sunday.
   ``Our compatriots must imperatively, no matter what pain they
have suffered, chase from their hearts the cowardly sentiment of
vengeance,'' Interior Minister Gibril Ould Abdallahy said in a
statement broadcast Tuesday on Mauritanian radio and television.
   He announced an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew in Nouakchott and
Nouadihbou, the principal port.
   A government source denied reports three people died in
Nouakchott violence, although he added officials do not have
complete casualty lists.
   Truckloads of police, some with riot helmets and shields, rushed
through the streets of this sand-blown capital of 500,000 people.
   Violence has been concentrated in poor quarters and shantytowns.
Angry crowds formed in dirt back streets, occasionally surging onto
a main artery to attack Senegalese and sometimes wreck or burn a
shop. Police broke up the crowds with tear gas and clubs.
   Knots of Mauritanians demanded to see ID cards and roughed up
those who did not prove they were Mauritanian.
   Mauritania straddles Arab north and black West Africa.
Two-thirds of its 2 million people are Moors of Arab-Berber
extraction. The rest are black, mostly from the southern river
region. Senegal's 7 million people almost all are black.
   In Dakar, many women and children sought refuge in the
Mauritanian Embassy, Ambassador Mokhtar Ould Zamel said. They were
escorted to the central mosque. Many have asked to be repatriated.
   Senegalese authorities said they arrested large numbers of
vandals, but did not confirm reports that hundreds have been
detained.
   This violence was sparked over the right of Senegalese to farm
on a Senegal River island.
   Even before the colonial period, the black Toucouleur people
farmed both sides of the Senegal River. After both countries became
independent from France in 1960, Senegalese Toucouleur continued to
farm the Mauritanian side they had considered their own for
generations.
   Moors to the north, traditionally nomadic herders, did not farm.
But the recent completion of two dams on the river has opened up
new farmland and spurred Mauritanian interest in agriculture. All
along the border, Senegalese are being forced off the land.

<HEAD>JFK's Daughter, Brother Help Launch Statewide Appeal For Statue Funds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy joined a statewide appeal
Tuesday to raise money for a statue of his brother John, saying he
was glad the memorial focuses on the late president's birthday and
not the day he was assassinated.
   ``We do not want to relive my brother's death. We want to
remember his life,'' Kennedy said at a Statehouse news conference
that included the late president's daughter, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   The 8-foot bronze statue is being created by artist Isabel
McIlvain of Sherborn, whose design was chosen through a nationwide
competition. It depicts Kennedy striding into a breeze, with his
left hand tucked in his pocket.
   State Rep. John MacGovern, co-chair of a special legislative
commission on the statue, said he was confident the sculpture would
be unveiled by May 19, 1990, the 73rd anniversary of Kennedy's
birth.
   ``At long last Massachusetts will properly remember and note the
wonderful contributions of this outstanding citizens and this
political hero for so many of us on both sides of the political
aisle,'' said MacGovern.
   About $60,000 has been raised so far of the overall fund-raising
goal, MacGovern said. The overall goal of $400,000 includes
maintenance funds and some scholarship money.
   Commission members say they want to raise the money in small
donations from each of the state's 351 cities and towns rather than
make corporate appeals. No public funds are to be used.
   ``They wanted this to be a presentation from the people. They
didn't want it just to be something the state was funding,'' said
Jim Burke, aide to state Sen. Paul White, co-chair with MacGovern.
   Although John F. Kennedy never served in the state government,
his brother said he had close ties to the Massachusetts political
tradition.
   He said the Kennedy family has been concerned that most tributes
to JFK focus on Nov. 22, 1963, the day Kennedy was shot, and he was
pleased with the planned May dedication of the sculpture.
   ``Now on the grounds of the statehouse he loved Jack will stand
... forever young,'' Kennedy said.
   Schlossberg spoke briefly, saying the statue will ``encourage
and inspire other people to dedicate their time and energy to
public service.''
   Dukakis said the statue and Kennedy's life commemorate the
importance of public service.
   ``One of the reasons I believe it's so important that we
remember this man in this place in front of this historic building
is it makes sure that here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts we
have a constant reminder of what public service is all about,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Educators Appeal for More Independence for Universities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international group of bishops and
educators urged the Vatican on Tuesday to safeguard academic
independence in Roman Catholic universities.
   The appeal came at the conclusion of a weeklong meeting to
assess a draft of a major Vatican document on Catholic higher
education. The draft has drawn sharp criticism from college
officials who charge it could undermine academic freedom.
   Delegates from the United States, which has the world's largest
Catholic college system, said at a news conference Tuesday they are
optimistic the Vatican will heed the representatives' wishes.
   But the final document must be approved by Pope John Paul II. In
a closing address to the conference, the pope called for a ``more
strict and faithful collaboration'' between the universities and
the Catholic hierarchy.
   The representatives, in a near-unanimous vote, said the document
should contain non-binding guidelines that are general and
inspirational, rather than specific.
   ``My impression is that the Congregation will do a major
rewrite,'' said the Rev. Raymond Fitz, president of the University
of Dayton in Ohio, referring to the Vatican's Congregation for
Catholic Education.
   The first draft of the education document, issued in 1985,
assigned church authorities some power over Catholic colleges and
universities to ensure that teachers adhered to church doctrine and
``uprightness of life.''
   Those teachers judged not doing so would be subject to dismissal.
   The document, circulated to educators and bishops, drew strong
protests, and a second draft was prepared and presented at the
meeting this week.
   About 175 college presidents, bishops and education experts from
40 countries discussed the draft with Vatican officials and came up
with 10 recommendations for a third version.
   The new proposals say the Vatican document ``should be positive,
inspirational and future-oriented'' and that Catholic universities
must be allowed to run themselves.
   ``Freedom of research and teaching must be recognized and
respected,'' the proposals said.
   Deciding how ``Catholic'' a Catholic university must be is a
touchy issue. The Vatican under John Paul is trying to eliminate
the confusion it blames on the teaching of dissident theologians
and to strengthen the church through emphasis on traditional
principles.
   At the same time, many universities say they must allow
exploration of new theories, however unorthodox, as part of their
role as centers of research and study.
   Many of the U.S. officials said they were surprised to find the
Vatican very receptive to their ideas.
   ``This is innovative as Vatican congregations operate _ far more
participatory,'' said the Rev. William Byron, president of Catholic
University of America in Washington, D.C. ``We've gotten a step
further down the line.''
   Several representatives and Vatican officials at the conference
formed a 15-member committee that will review the third draft of
the document this fall. U.S. officials said it was significant that
the Congregation would ask college officials for another opinion.
   But the college representatives and bishops at this week's
meeting play only an advisory role, and Vatican officials and the
pope will decide the shape of the final paper.

   A private Finnish medical center will
open a branch in Leningrad for tourists, foreign residents and
Soviet citizens with hard currency, doctors said Tuesday.
   The health center will open in July and will employ Finnish
doctors and Soviet staff. The medicines and equipment will be from
western countries, and the center will have its own laboratory,
X-ray equipment and ultrasound scanners, doctors said.
   A visit to a physician will cost about $71, said Harri Eloranta,
a specialist at the Pinsetti Medical Center in Riihimaki, in
southern Finland. The center owns 70 percent of the joint venture
known as Lenfinmed.
   Eloranta said the goal was to provide reliable basic services.
   Lenfinmed has been given permission to expand to other cities in
the Soviet Union and will open similar centers in Moscow, Tallinn,
Vyborg and Shotshi, if the Leningrad experiment works, Eloranta
said.

   President Bush said Tuesday he will
nominate Richard L. Armitage, the assistant secretary of defense
for international security affairs, to be the next secretary of the
Army.
   The 43-year-old Armitage was picked for the Army's top civilian
post by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in late March after
originally accepting a post at the State Department.
   Assuming Senate confirmation, Armitage will replace John O.
Marsh, who has held the position since the first day of the Reagan
administration and who has made clear his desire to retire once a
successor was picked.
   In his current job, Armitage has played a key role in overseeing
American security assistance programs around the world as well as
counter-terrorism and Vietnam POW-MIA issues.
   Armitage becomes the second service secretary to be announced by
Bush. On April 13, the president said he would nominate Navy Under
Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III to take over the top job with
that service.
   Pentagon sources, requesting anonymity, have said Cheney wants
Bush to nominate Donald B. Rice of the think tank Rand Corp. to
head the Air Force.

   A Silver Spring, Md., man, who became the
first patient in the country to receive a new heart and pancreas at
the same time, was reported Tuesday in critical but guarded
condition after his pancreas was surgically removed.
   Barry Katz, 45, a longtime diabetic whose pancreas had virtually
destroyed his heart, underwent surgery Monday night to remove the
pancreas because a peptic ulcer had developed on an adjoining
section of bowel, Washington Hospital Center spokeswoman Clare
Fiore said.
   Katz, a Defense Department physicist, underwent surgery on March
25.
   He was initially given an 80 percent chance of surviving a year.
Hospital offiicals now refuse to comment on his chances.
   Katz's body did not reject the organ, Ms. Fiore said. She said
another transplant may be attempted, but Katz's condition would
have to stabilize first.
   Tests are expected to be completed Friday that will determine
what caused the ulcer. The pancreas itself will also be examined to
determine if an infection existed and, if it did, contributed to
the ulcer.
   The pancreas is supposed to produce insulin, the hormone that
regulates the body's metabolism of sugar. When the organ doesn't
function properly, patients develop diabetes and often have to rely
on insulin injections and constant monitoring to survive.

   A mob of 100 villagers drove off
environmentalists who had chained themselves to a wharf for 19
hours to protest alleged pollution by the town's main employer,
news reports said Tuesday.
   The four activists were roughed up and sprayed with water from
firehoses after protesting against the ilmenite mine run by Titania
A-S, which they say dumps ecologically damaging waste into a nearby
fiord. The mine employs about 350 people in the town of 3,500
people.
   Environmentalists want the residues dumped on land instead of
the ocean but Titania has said it obeys state guidelines.
   Titania, owned by N.L. Chemicals Inc., of Hightstown, N.J., in
1983 became the object of Norway's first major protest against an
alleged industrial polluter.
   ``I don't understand why they were so furious. We have been
holding protests here since 1983 and know many of the villagers,''
said Rune Haaland, one of the activists.
   No one was injured, according to the Oslo newspaper Aftenposten.

   A House committee on Wednesday approved a $1.4
billion bill reauthorizing the federal vocational training program,
after first removing a requirement that certain amounts be set
aside for certain groups.
   However, the measure stipulates that the states are to make sure
the money is distributed in the most effective way that also
insures fair treatment for particular segments of the population _
such as the physically handicapped, single parents and those who do
not speak English.
   The Bush administration opposed writing into the law a specific
amount to be spent on certain categories of people and the panel
members had heard testimony prior to final action on the bill that
the set-asides had not proved effective.
   The Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984, which
expires Sept. 30, says 10 percent of the grants are to go to the
handicapped, 22 percent to the disadvantaged, 12 percent to adults,
8.5 percent to single parents and homemakers, 3.5 percent to
elimination of sex bias, and 1 percent to the incarcerated.
   The Bush administration had requested $949 million for fiscal
year 1990, up from the current $918 million. However, critics said
that level would amount to a cut because it would not keep pace
with inflation.
   The measure is expected to reach the House floor next month,
where easy passage is anticipated.

   A House committee acted Wednesday to impeach
federal Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi before he is released
from federal prison and returns to the District Court to hear cases.
   ``I believe that Judge Nixon should have had the good grace to
resign when his appeals were exhausted,'' Rep. James Sensenbrenner,
R-Wis., said as the Judiciary Committee approved three articles of
impeachment 34-0.
   The full House is planning floor action on the articles of
impeachment this week. If they are approved, Nixon would stand
impeached and be tried later by the Senate with House members
acting as prosecutors.
   The Senate is currently preparing to hear evidence in the trial
of Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Florida, who was impeached by the
House last year even though he was acquitted in 1983 of plotting to
obtain payoffs.
   The articles accuse Nixon of lying to a federal grand jury and
Justice Department investigators looking into the oil and gas
investment that was arranged for him by a wealthy businessman,
Wiley Fairchild.
   Nixon is accused of bringing the federal judiciary into
disrepute and undermining its integrity by claiming he never played
any role in a case involving marijuana smuggling charges against
Fairchild's son.
   He already is serving two concurrent five-year perjury sentences
imposed after he was convicted in 1986. Since then, he has
collected $286,000 in federal judicial salary and plans, when he is
released in a few months, to return to the bench and try cases,
according to authorities.
   Defense attorney David Stewart says that some of the statements
cited as instances of perjury were factual and that in any case
Nixon never did anything that warranted impeachment. He says Nixon
was subjected to ``a sensationalized investigation and an unfair
trial.''
   Lawmakers said they were unable to agree with Stewart's
contentions in the course of their investigation of Nixon.
   ``His pattern of lies and deceit led ... to the inevitable
conclusion that he has to be impeached,'' said Rep. Don Edwards,
D-Calif.

   Sworn statements about a dog that
understood Estonian and trysts between a defense attorney and
courtroom marshal are some of the odd turns a long trial of three
leftist militants has taken.
   Tuesday was day 37 of testimony and arguments in the federal
trial of two men and a woman accused of plotting to overthrow the
United States government by force. The charge also known as
seditious conspiracy rarely has been used since it was invoked
during the Civil War to prosecute Confederate loyalists.
   Despite the historical weight of the proceeding, which involves
some of the major violent radicals of the 1970s, the dozen or so
marshals guarding the courtroom usually far outnumber the few
spectators.
   The 17-member jury yawned and fidgeted through Monday's skirmish
between defendant Raymond Luc Levasseur, dressed in blue jeans, and
Georgia Hill, a gray-suited Detroit lawyer who was friends with
some associates of the defendants when she studied at Harvard Law
School a decade ago.
   Levasseur, who is serving as his own lawyer, has accused Hill
and others of informing on the radicals, who sometimes called
themselves the United Freedom Front and are accused of bombing
buildings and robbing banks around the Northeast from 1975 to 1981.
   ``I would like you to cooperate, although not as much as you did
with the FBI,'' Levasseur said, in the kind of bitter aside that
jurors have come to expect of him.
   Hill was the 91st witness on the stand, and prosecutors are only
a quarter of the way into their witness list.
   Levasseur, 42, faces a maximum of 60 years in prison if
convicted on three charges of seditious conspiracy, racketeering
and racketeering conspiracy. On trial on the same charges are his
wife, Patricia Gros Levasseur, 40, and Richard Williams, 41.
   There were seven defendants at the time of the initial jury
selection in March 1988. Prosecutors dropped charges against Thomas
Manning and Jaan Karl Laaman, already serving lengthy sentences on
other charges. Manning's wife, Carol Manning, pleaded guilty to
sedition and other charges, and a separate trial was ordered for
Laaman's wife, Barbara Curzi-Laaman.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Loucks questioned Hill on April
13 about a dog she said former co-defendant Jaan Karl Laaman had
taught commands in Estonian.
   ``Did you ever hear him talk to the dog?'' Young asked her.
   She replied: ``A couple of commands, like sort of `sit' and
`stop.'''
   Young later struck the comments, saying, ``I can't for the life
of me see how that would be a statement made in furtherance of the
conspiracy.''
   Ms. Curzi-Laaman's attorney, Linda J. Thompson, and a U.S.
marshal assigned to guard the courthouse during the trial were the
subject of an April 7 hearing for their love affair during jury
selection. A judge found that the pair had not discussed court
business during the liaison.

   A delegation of Nicaraguan opposition leaders,
ranging from an anti-Sandinista Communist to Contra rebel
spokesmen, accused the Nicaraguan government Tuesday of laying the
groundwork for a rigged presidential election next February.
   The State Department leveled similar charges and appealed to the
Sandinistas to meet opposition demands for a more equitable process.
   The Nicaraguan delegation said the Sandinistas are attempting to
ensure victory in the election by stacking the all-powerful Supreme
Electoral Council in their favor and by denying the opposition
equal access to media outlets.
   Twelve opposition leaders took part in a news conference,
including Eli Altamirano of the Communist Party and three members
of the U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
   The occasion for their appearance was the deadline, established
at a Central American summit meeting last February in El Salvador,
for setting in motion an electoral process that will culminate in
national elections 10 months from now.
   At the summit, the Sandinistas promised to hold free and fair
elections and the presidents agreed in return to draw up a plan for
demobilizing the thousands of Contras assembled at camps in
Honduras along the Nicaraguan border. The rebels have been
subsisting on food and other non-lethal aid provided by the United
States.
   The Nicaraguan delegation had raised its concerns earlier about
Sandinista policy toward the elections in meetings with officials
from the United Nations and the Organization of American States.
   ``We have denounced in these meetings the lack of compliance by
the government of President Daniel Ortega in relation to the
commitments which they undertook in El Salvador,'' said Agustin
Jarquin, a representative of the Social Christian Party.
   He said Sandinista actions ``will not permit fair and honest
political competition.''
   Jaime Bonilla, a member of the Independent Liberal Party, said
the Sandinistas have agreed to name a non-partisan individual as
head of the election council but that other aspects of the
electoral machinery ``would remain dominated by the Sandinista
front.''
   Nicaraguan Embassy spokeswoman Cecilia Lopez said the new
election laws were approved with the participation of the political
parties represented in the legislature and are in compliance with
the terms of the Central American summit meeting.
   In a telephone interview, she said the law allows opposition
parties more airtime for campaign purposes than they would have
received under their original request.
   In addition, she said, the Sandinistas, consistent with another
pledge made at the summit, have released about 1,700 National
Guardsmen who served the rightist regime which was ousted by the
Sandinistas a decade ago.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
administration is troubled by both the substance of Nicaragua's
electoral laws and the manner in which they have been put into
effect.
   The electoral law approved last week ``is not the result of good
faith bargaining between the government of Nicaragua and the
internal opposition groups, and was unilaterally imposed after
being passed by the Sandinista-dominated legislature,'' she said.
   She said the law includes a provision requiring that the
election council of which the Sandinistas maintain control receive
one-half of any foreign political contributions.
   The law ignores, she said, proposals made by the internal
opposition for absentee balloting and procedures for ensuring the
presence and unlimited access of international election observers.
   A new law governing press conduct, she added, includes penalties
for disseminating information which the Interior Ministry
determines to be a violation of national integrity and allows
officials to order closures of up to four days.

<HEAD>Afghan Soldiers Kill 58 Guerrillas in Latest Jalalabad Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday that its
forces killed 58 Moslem guerrillas mounting another attack on the
eastern city of Jalalabad.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammed Nabi also said 250
guerrillas were killed in other fighting. His claims could not be
independently verified.
   The Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan meanwhile reported
thousands of casualties by both sides in the seven-week siege on
Jalalabad, and he compared the intense shelling to that of the
World War II battle of Stalingrad.
   Yuli M. Vorontsov also said the offensive appears to have been
orchestrated entirely by the Pakistani military, not by the
government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   ``I don't think she's looking for a military solution,''
Vorontsov said. ``I think she wants peace and quiet in Afghanistan.
The Pakistani military has some thing else in mind. They want
people who are going to be very obedient to Pakistan.''
   According to a report in The New York Times on Sunday, Ms.
Bhutto's government ordered the frontal assault on Jalalabad last
month despite opposition from Pakistan's military intelligence
servicee. The newspaper said the decision was made in the presence
of the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Robert Oakley. It said no
resistance leaders were at the meeting.
   Islamabad has denied the allegations, and Washington has refused
comment.
   President Najib frequently has accused Pakistan, its eastern
neighbor, of armed aggression and interference in his country.
   ``I think it was entirely a plot of the Pakistani military,''
Vorontsov said in an interview in the Soviet Embassy compound.
   Guerrillas fired a rocket into the compound Thursday, and the
explosion shattered windows but caused no casualties among the 260
people staying there.
   ``If there is a second one,'' Vorontsov warned, ``they will be
sorry.''
   ``We will reply swiftly and decisively,'' he said. ``Our reply
is ready and it won't be in a diplomatic note.''
   The guerrillas, who are armed and supported by the United
States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China, began fighting to
overthrow the pro-Soviet government shortly after it seized power
in a 1978 coup.
   The Soviet Union sent soldiers to support the government in
1979. More than 100,000 soldiers were in the country before
Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet Union
signed a U.N.-sponsored agreement.
   On March 6, three weeks after the last Soviet soldiers left
Afghanistan, the insurgents launched the attack on Jalalabad, about
45 miles from the border with Pakistan.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said government
soldiers had inflicted heavy blows to the guerrillas in their
latest attack.
   He said 58 guerrillas were killed and 49 others wounded since
Monday night. One soldier also was killed and six civilians
injured, he said.
   Elsewhere, the military killed 250 guerrillas and wounded 300
others in fighting in the southern city of Kandahar and two
civilians died and six others were injured in the western city of
Herat, he said.
   According to Vorontsov, Jalalabad has been hit by tens of
thousands of rockets since the siege began. He said officials had
calculated the rate of shelling was comparable to the battle of
Stalingrad.
   He said more than 5,000 guerrillas have been killed and about
another 3,500 have been injured.
   He also said about 2,500 soldiers had been killed or wounded and
that the that the casualties among civilians also have been high,
although he did not have any figures.
   ``If their aim is to find a place for their so-called
government, they're not going to do it there,'' he said.
   The resistance in February formed an interim government in
Pakistan. Capturing Jalalabad would give them a base on Afghan soil.
   Vorontsov said he plans to continue contacts with with
resistance leaders in Pakistan and Iran to reach a negotiated
settlement. He said the issue would be brought up during Secretary
of State James Baker III's trip to Moscow next month.
   ``What surprises me is the line of the American adminstration,''
he said. ``In other parts of the world, they are interested in a
political solution. Why are they playing another ball game here?''

<HEAD>North Lawyers Ask ``Appropriate Relief'' After NBC Letters to Jurors</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-North Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North's lawyers asked the trial judge
Tuesday to determine after the verdict how jurors might have been
influenced by an NBC News request to interview them after the trial
ends.
   ``The defense further requests that the court grant appropriate
relief after the hearing,'' said the motion filed by Brendan
Sullivan while the jury was deliberating for the fourth day.
   On Saturday, NBC hand-delivered letters to the jurors' homes,
saying ``we would like to talk to you after the trial is over;
please call us then.'' Learning of this, U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell convened a hearing and called the attempt ``most
inappropriate, improper conduct, quite disrespectful.''
   In his motion, Sullivan took note of Gesell's remark that one
``juror was angry and must have mentioned the fact to other jurors
who immediately showed similar concern.''
   Sullivan said the hearing should determine ``whether the jurors'
reaction to the letter has prejudiced defendant North.''
   An NBC News spokeswoman said after Gesell's remarks that the
network had meant no harm and had assumed the jurors wouldn't see
the letters until after arriving home after the trial. Until they
reach a verdict, the jurors are sequestered in a motel while not
deliberating.

   Tourists said the capital's luxury hotels
swayed like flagpoles in Tuesday's earthquake and it felt like a
rollercoaster ride, frightening some so badly they cut short their
vacations and headed for more stable ground.
   ``We were in bed and she thought I was shaking the bed and I
thought the people next door were shaking the walls,'' said Les
Giddings of Miami as he and his wife, Maria, checked out of the
Hotel Krystal in the Zona Rosa tourist area.
   They were a day and a half into their honeymoon when the quake
hit at 8:26 a.m.
   ``Once it really got going you could hear a rumble. It felt like
a good rollercoaster ride,'' said Giddings.
   Two hairline cracks ran down the walls, one in the bedroom, one
in the bathroom, popping chips of paint off the walls. Running down
the stairs from their 10th floor room after the motion stopped,
they saw chunks of plaster scattered about.
   They had planned to go to the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco
but changed their minds when they heard the quake was centered near
there.
   ``We're going anywhere in the States,'' Mrs. Giddings said,
``It's a terrifying experience.''
   She said Disneyworld was one possibility.
   Tourists at other hotels said they saw other people checking
out, cutting vacations short because of the quake, which measured
6.8 on the Richter scale.
   Across the street, in the Century Hotel, Cobe Eekels-Bakker of
Amstelveen, the Netherlands, at first thought she was ill, then
noticed that everything was moving back and forth.
   ``I could see through my window stones and dirt coming down,''
she said.
   Although slowed by an already existing hip injury, she grabbed
her purse and cane to run down the steps from her eighth-floor room.
   ``Everybody was going past me. Then somebody took me and brought
me downstairs quickly,'' she said.
   ``I have cried,'' she said, sitting in the lobby more than an
hour later, still shaken.
   The quake sloshed water from the hotel's rooftop pool, over the
walls onto cars parked on the street 23 floors below.
   Three hours later, Sheila and Don Walters of Westport, Conn.,
who had been staying in the Maria Isabel Sheraton, said they
decided to continue their vacation and go on to Acapulco.
   ``I'm still actually dizzy from it,'' Mrs. Walters said. ``I
don't feel I have my legs under me yet.''
   She remembered sitting in their sixth-floor room, waking up with
a cup of coffee just before the quake.
   ``There was a Do Not Disturb sign on the inside of the door
wiggling. I was sitting there, trying to wake up, wondering what
was making the sign move.'' About five minutes later, the whole
building began shaking.
   ``I felt like I was going to pass out. I was really frightened,
it was a sort of panic attack,'' she said.
   But her husband, everyone agreed, stayed calm throughout.
   ``It was like being on the top of a flagpole,'' he said.
   Richard Cummings of Selden, N.Y., recovering from a two-day bout
of illness, tried to get out of bed when he heard the bathroom door
bang and felt the building sway.
   ``It was strong enough to make me fall back down on my bed when
I got up,'' he said. ``That's when I realized what was happening.''
   Lauren Wilson of Henley-on-Thames, England, had been in an
earthquake in Japan but said it was ``not as bad as this.''
   She called her husband Phil from the bathroom of their
15th-floor room.
   ``We sat on the bed and held each other,'' she said.
   ``We could just see our building moving relative to the other
buildings,'' he said. While it seemed like a lot, it looked like
about a foot, he said.

<HEAD>U.S. May Allow Stranded Family To Return</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Cuban family from Florida that was
stranded in Canada after a sightseeing trip five months ago may
soon be granted political asylum, U.S. immigration officials said
Tuesday.
   Carlos Fajardo has provided information that substantiates his
claim that he would face political persecution if returned to Cuba,
said Benedict Ferro, district director of the federal Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
   ``It is not a frivolous claim,'' Ferro said. ``We would not turn
people away under those circumstances.''
   Ferro would not discuss details of the case but did say that
pending a State Department review of the case, the Fajardos might
be allowed to return in a few weeks.
   Fajardo, his wife, Bermaida Zamora-Powers, and her two children,
Yoradlys Diaz and Yoandys Diaz, have lived on charity since Dec.
23, when they were denied re-entry into the United States at the
Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls because they are illegal aliens.
The couple told border authorities that they had driven north to
find snow for Christmas and had ventured into Canada to view the
falls.
   The family lived for several weeks in a Niagara Falls, Ontario,
motel, then in a Fort Erie apartment under the sponsorship of
Ontario refugee groups.
   ``It looks like we may finally be able to work something out,''
said Sister Kathleen Rimar, Fajardo's Catholic Charities attorney
in Buffalo.
   Last month, Ferro denied Fajardo's application to return to
Miami on humanitarian parole. Despite pressure from charitable
organizations and from Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., Ferro had insisted
that the family not be readmitted because of their record of
immigration fraud and other unspecified evidence.
   Immigration officials said Tuesday Fajardo and his wife still
are guilty of substantial fraud against the U.S. government and
other offenses. But they also said such violations can be
overlooked in light of concern over possible persecution.
   Information regarding the potential for persecution for Fajardo
in Cuba, they added, was not available until he was allowed to
enter the United States late last month for an interview with
immigration officials in Buffalo.
   Sister Rimar said that, for the first time since December, the
family has some hope of returning to the Miami area. But their stay
in Canada has exhausted their resources, she said.
   ``Their situation is a mess,'' she said. ``They have no home or
business to return to, and they're in danger of having their car
repossessed. They'll have to start off basically with nothing and
work their way back again.''

   Police and KGB officers killed one inmate and
captured two others who had taken four woman hostage and demanded
to be freed from a prison camp in the Soviet Far East, Tass said
Tuesday.
   The escape attempt Monday was the second this month that
involved hostages and resulted in a prisoner's death, the Soviet
news agency said.
   The convicts at a camp in Khabarovsk took the women employees
hostage, and demanded safe passage, submachine guns and
bullet-proof vests, Tass said.
   After negotiations failed, KGB and police shot and killed one
prisoner and disarmed the other two, Tass reported.
   Tass said the women were released unhurt, but further details
were not immediately available.
   Khabarovsk is located on the Amur River near the Soviet border
with the Manchurian area of China.
   On April 12, two armed inmates of a Ukrainian prison colony
armed with home-made weapons sneaked into an administrative
building and took eight women hostage, demanding a bus and safe
passage. One prisoner was killed and the other wounded by police
gunfire, Tass said.

<HEAD>Gingrich Denies Helping Book Investors With Their Government Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich said
Tuesday that none of the 22 investors in a partnership created to
promote a book he co-authored ever received ``unusual or
extraordinary personal help'' from him in their dealings with the
federal government.
   But Gingrich, during a stormy news conference which his wife
left in anger, acknowledged that some of the investors had a direct
interest in legislation and that he had handled routine requests
from some of them.
   While House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts worth
more than $100 from people with direct interest in legislation,
Gingrich said the partnership did not violate House rules because
the $5,000 that each investor put into the deal did not constitute
a gift.
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., has filed a formal complaint with
the House ethics committee alleging that the partnership involved
10 apparent violations of House rules. The committee has not
indicated whether it will launch a preliminary investigation of the
complaint.
   Gingrich, who initiated the investigation that led to House
Speaker Jim Wright's being charged with 69 violations of House
rules last week, said he was satisfied that each investor in the
partnership ``thought there was a reasonable chance that it might
make money.''
   In exchange for their investments, the 19 individuals and three
corporations that formed the COS Limited Partnership in 1984 were
promised half of the publisher's profits from the book, ``Window of
Opportunity,'' written by Gingrich; his wife, Marianne Gingrich,
and David Drake.
   According to hundreds of pages of financial documents and tax
returns released Tuesday by Gingrich, the partnership spent $51,571
to promote and advertise the book from 1984 through 1986, but the
publisher still had a net loss of $6,259 on the book by the end of
1987.
   Because the partnership received no profits from book sales, the
$104,185 loss it generated from 1984 to 1988 was distributed among
the partners, providing them with tax writeoffs.
   Mrs. Gingrich, as general partner of the partnership, received a
$10,000 payment in 1984 for setting up the organization, and later
received a 2 percent interest in the partnership and a $1,500
payment, according to the documents. She did not invest any of her
own money in the partnership.
   Alexander's complaint alleges in part that the payments and
ownership interest in the partnership that Mrs. Gingrich received
were gifts that violated House rules limiting gifts members may
receive.
   The complaint parallels the ethics committee's allegation that
the salary and benefits Wright's wife, Betty, received from an
investment corporation were actually gifts because there was no
evidence that Mrs. Wright did any work for the corporation.
   Mrs. Gingrich said Tuesday that she kept all the records for the
partnership, interviewed potential investors to ensure they were
qualified and handled the filings necessary to comply with various
state securities laws.
   She left the news conference abruptly after telling reporters
she was upset that no one seemed interested in going through the
350 pages of tax returns, financial records and incorporation
papers that she had put together in response to questions about the
book deal.
   Gingrich defended his wife, telling reporters that unlike Mrs.
Wright, ``she actually did the work for the money she got.'' He
said the 350 pages of documents ``represent her work product.''
   Gingrich said he was willing to concede that the book
partnership was ``unusual.'' But he said there was nothing
``unethical'' in the deal, which he described as markedly different
from the financial arrangements for Wright's book, ``Reflections of
a Public Man.''
   ``We wrote a real book, working with a real publisher
distributed to real bookstores and sold to real people for a
realistic, standard royalty,'' he said. ``Jim Wright did none of
those things.''
   Part of the ethics committee's charges against Wright allege
that he violated House rules on outside income limits though bulk
sales of his book, on which he received a 55 percent royalty.

   A Boeing engineer testified Tuesday that the
cargo doors of the company's 747 jetliners are safe, but a
colleague at Pan Am recalled a 1987 episode in which one of the
doors partially opened in flight.
   The engineers spoke at a National Transportation Safety Board
hearing on the February accident that tore the cargo door off a
United Airlines plane near Hawaii, killing nine passengers.
   The opening session of the three-day hearing was dominated by
detailed and technical testimony on the design and operation of the
800-pound cargo doors.
   ``The basic system has been a safe and reliable system for many,
many years,'' said James Fitzgerald, a fuselage structural design
manager for The Boeing Co., which builds 747s in Everett.
   But Robert Dann of Pan Am said that testing after the 1987
episode, in which the cargo door came partially open in a flight
from London, showed the door could open in mid-flight if there was
damage to parts of the locking system.
   The plane involved in that incident returned safely to London,
Dann said.
   The NTSB is looking into the Feb. 24 accident of United Flight
811, which lost the cargo door and part of its fuselage in an
explosive decompression shortly after takeoff from Honolulu. Nine
passengers sitting above the cargo door were sucked out.
   Although two engines conked out, pilot David Cronin managed to
land at Honolulu with no further loss of life.
   The United 747-100, built in 1970, was one of the first jumbo
jets built by the Seattle-based company. It had over 58,800 flight
hours.
   Lee Dickinson, chairman of the hearing panel, said the NTSB is
still studying the costs and benefits of retrieving the door of the
craft from under nearly 17,000 feet of water in the Pacific Ocean,
85 miles southwest of Honolulu.
   There has been speculation the cargo door may have broken free
when the latching mechanism failed. United records indicated there
had been recent problems with the door before the accident, causing
the door to be closed manually rather than electrically on several
occasions.
   The FAA on March 3 issued an emergency order requiring all U.S.
airlines to reinforce within 30 days the relatively lightweight
aluminum latch mechanisms with steel, so the doors would be less
vulnerable to damage caused by improper closing.

   The absence of strong, untainted leaders in the
governing Liberal Democratic Party was a big reason Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita held on so long through a personally painful and
damaging scandal.
   Takeshita, 65, was in power only 18 months and had to deal from
his first days in office with the multimillion dollar scandal
involving the Recruit information conglomerate.
   He announced Tuesday he will resign. That had been expected, but
it still left the Liberal Democratic Party, which has been in
control since 1948, foundering.
   Takeshita was LDP president, and that assured him of becoming
prime minister in November 1987 when Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakosone retired.
   And although the new LDP president could expect to become prime
minister, the party is riddled with factions.
   ``Many of the leaders of factions inside the LDP are themselves
involved in the Recruit scandal, so it would be difficult to find
someone to take Takeshita's place,'' said Seisaburo Sato, a
political science professor at Tokyo University.
   Unlike questions of personal finances in the 1970s that led to
the resignation of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, the Recruit
scandal has scarred virtually all the LDP factions.
   Political analaysts said the plunge of Takeshita's popularity in
public opinion polls to less than 4 percent reflected broad
opposition to the political system, often characterized by
back-room dealings.
   ``I feel deeply responsible for having fostered such distrust,''
Takeshita said in his resignation announcment. He said he would
leave office after parliament approves the budget for fiscal 1989.
   The Recruit scandal created a stalemate in Parliament with a
boycott of the budget debate by opposition members demanding former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone be called for questioning about
payments and stock deals by Recruit to politicians and the LDP.
   For many people the scandal revealed the extent of unreported
money flowing between business and government. Analysts, noting the
years the LDP has governed, suggested a system of ``structural
corruption'' had been created.
   Some LDP members, including reform leader Masayoshi Takemura,
have said the party may not be able to end its dependence on large
sums of money from the business world and maintain its dominance.
   ``Sometimes I think we may have to dissolve the party and start
again from zero,'' Takemura said last week.
   Takako Doi, head of the Socialist Party, told other opposition
leaders at a strategy session this month that the scandal offered a
rare opportunity to wrest power from the LDP.
   ``This is a time of unprecedented importance,'' she said.
   Fuyuko Kamisaka, a prominent writer on women's and consumer
issues, suggested in a television interview that an independent
panel be appointed to supervise political reforms.
   ``I hope that someone not directly linked to the political world
can lead a fundamental reform of politics that will eliminate the
flow of `strange' money,'' she said.

   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's
resignation likely will further delay action on the controversial
FSX fighter project, official sources said Tuesday.
   Some high-level sources suggested the end result could be a
weaker deal for the United States, or a complete unraveling of the
plan to jointly build a new fighter based on the American F-16.
   Takeshita's announcement that he would step down as a result of
an influence-peddling scandal brings new uncertainty to the
already-troubled FSX plan, said administration and congressional
officials, all of whom declined to be identified.
   The sources suggested it is now unlikely there will be any
movement in stalled negotiations on the project until a successor
to Takeshita takes office.
   ``It's not on the verge of being resolved now anyway,'' said one
administration soucre.
   ``We're continuing to try to clarify the conditions'' on the
project set down a month ago by U.S. negotiators. ``It's proven to
be a very difficult process.''
   Although President Bush signaled general support for the joint
venture in mid-March, Japanese officials balked at some of the
conditions he stipulated _ including a guarantee that U.S.
companies have a 40 percent share in the production of the new jet.
   The United States also wants assurances that any new technology
developed from the project would be available to the United States,
along with protection for U.S.-developed computer codes that help
fly and control the plane.
   The agreement to co-develop the FSX, which stands for Fighter
Support Experimental, was negotiated late last year between
Takeshita's government and the outgoing Reagan adminstration.
   Under the agreement, General Dynamics Corp. would build the
upgraded F-16 with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
   The plan encountered stiff opposition in the
Democratic-controlled Congress, where critics have called it a $7
billion giveaway of high technology to Japan _ suggesting the
United States would get little in return.
   Takeshita's resignation will make it ``harder to deal with the
issue,'' said Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   ``I think the position of the Japanese will be that, because
they're in a difficult circumstance, they can't give as much as
they might have on FSX,'' Gephardt said in an interview.
   He also said that the Japanese government might use the current
political turmoil there to its advantage in seeking U.S.
concessions in other U.S.-Japanese trade disputes.
   Proponents of the FSX project claim it represents a way to add
fighters to Japan's inventory in strategic northeast Asia at its
own expense and would give the United States access to
sophisticated radar technology developedby Mitsubishi.
   One congressional source involved in trade issues said that any
further delay in the project now would let Japan strengthen its
negotiating hand.
   ``Japan's final response on the FSX clearly had to be signed off
on by the prime minister. But there was divided counsel in Japan on
the terms and he (Takeshita) obviously has been preoccupied. This
will give them a chance to get their act together and play trade
hardball.''
   Any effort by Japan to demand further concessions from the
United States could jeopardize a project that already has thin
support in Congress, possibly torpedoing the plan entirely, said
both administration and congressional sources.
   Traveling with Bush in California, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater was asked what impact Takeshita's resignation might have
on the FSX project. ``We don't really know how it might affect that
deal,'' he said.
   Asked if the White House still favored moving ahead with the
agreement, with the new qualifications, Fitzwater said, ``Our
position is the same, we still hope so.''

   Jungle rebels broke a six-month lull
in their uprising by attacking a village, where they killed one
man, kidnapped two others, and set fire to homes, the state news
agency reported Tuesday.
   Witnesses said about 40 insurgents of a group known as the
Jungle Commando attacked Pokigron, about 100 miles south of this
capital city, early Sunday despite resistance by villagers armed
with shotguns.
   The attackers beat, stabbed, and then shot a man they suspected
to be an army spy, according to the state-run Suriname News Agency.
The victim later died in the hospital.
   The rebels also burned some homes and kidnapped the village
chief and a second man, the news agency said. The rebels doused the
chief with gasoline and threatened to burn him alive but halted
when villagers begged them to stop, the agency said.
   About 100 villagers fled to Paramaribo after the assault, the
news agency said. The insurgents reportedly escaped.
   The attack was the most serious in this former Dutch colony on
the northeastern coast of South America since cease-fire talks with
the government of President Ramsewak Shankar stalled in October
1988.
   Witnesses said Sunday's attackers were led by Ronny Brunswijk, a
one-time army private who began the uprising in 1986. More than 400
people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the rebellion.
   The insurgents have not publicly stated their grievances.

<HEAD>Iran Paper Supports Rafsanjani As Post-Khomeini Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICK LUDINGTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent Iranian newspaper on Tuesday
backed Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani to head a leadership
council that would eventually succeed the 88-year-old Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The state-controlled Ettelaat daily said in an editorial that no
single possible substitute for Khomeini existed ``when it comes to
knowledge and jurisprudence especially in the area of government .
.. or when such other factors as record of struggle or political
intuition is concerned.''
   It suggested a leadership council made up of present state
administrators and leading religious authorities in which one
member ``would be capable of saying the last word on matters of
dispute and able to adopt decisions on his own responsibility.''
   ``If we were to make a decision on the basis of a grade point
average of a candidate it seems ... Rafsanjani has the necessary
qualifications for heading the leadership council,'' Etelaat said.
   ``In all countries and with every leadership council there is
one member entitled to veto the vote of the rest.''
   It was the first public backing for a Khomeini successor since
Khomeini forced Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri to step down last
month as his officially designated successor.
   Rafsanjani is a leading candidate for president in elections
scheduled to be held this year to choose a successor to Ali
Khamenei, who is not permitted by the constitution to run for a
third four-year term.
   But under Iran's present system, the president divides power
with the prime minister and Parliament, all of them subject to the
authority of Khomeini. The revolutionary patriarch's separate
status as spiritual leader is unmatched and unlikely to be filled
after he dies, Iranian political experts say.
   Ettelaat's endorsement significantly boosts Rafsanjani's status
in current political infighting.
   Rafsanjani kept a low profile in a recent purge of moderates and
in the international outcry over Khomeini's death sentence decree
for British author Salman Rushdie. Rafsanjani is considered a
pragmatist able to maneuver between hard-line theologians and
others who wanted to soften the harsh Islamic revolution and end
Iran's international isolation.
   On Friday, he announced the discovery of a U.S. spy network
including senior Iranian naval officers, a move apparently aimed at
gaining points with the hardliners.
   On Saturday, Rafsanjani, 54, who also holds the post of acting
commander in chief of the armed forces, received backing for his
presidential campaign from an influential party of hardliners, the
Assembly of Combatant Theologians.
   And on Monday, Khomeini included Rafsanjani in a 20-man
committee given two months to ``rectify defects'' in Iran's 1980
revolutionary constitution. One task, Khomeini said, was to
consider the leadership question.
   Rafsanjani has been campaigning for a constitutional change
giving the president more power and abolishing the prime ministry.
   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi meanwhile said Tuesday that the
U.S. spy network which Rafsanjani reported uncovered recently had
direct contact with CIA offices in neighboring countries. Some
agents communicated with the Americans through West German
embassies in Europe, he said.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Musavi as saying in
an interview with the state-owned Islamic Republic News Agency that
the West Germans ``should know their embassies are at the service
of the American spy network.''
   He said some agents were in ``sensitive positions'' with access
to top secret information which they passed on to the Americans,
the radio reported.
   Musavi said the purported U.S. actions violated the Algiers
agreement, which stipulates non-interference by the United States
and Iran in each other's domestic affairs. He was apparently
referring to a 1980 accord under which Iran released 52 U.S.
diplomats held hostage in Tehran for 444 days.
   Musavi said Iran would lodge a complaint against America at the
International Court of Justice at the Hague.

<HEAD>Panel's Chairman Asks Members to Resist Lobbyists' Pressure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Banking Committee,
on the eve of public sessions to write savings and loan bailout
legislation, privately appealed to fellow Democrats Tuesday to
resist pressure from industry lobbyists or face the anger of
taxpayers.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, at a closed-door caucus of the
panel's Democrats, urged support for requiring S&amp;L owners to back
their lending with more of their own money, calling it ``the litmus
test on whether anything has changed'' and ``the guts of this whole
issue.''
   Capital investment from S&amp;L stockholders acts as a cushion,
absorbing losses that would otherwise have to be paid by government
deposit insurance. Gonzalez is attempting to persuade his 51-member
committee to toughen the standards passed earlier this month by the
panel's 47-member subcommittee on financial institutions, chaired
by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.
   More than 100 amendments are pending before the committee, which
in sessions scheduled Wednesday and Thursday is expected to re-hash
many of the battles fought during during 32 hours of subcommittee
deliberations.
   Gonzalez, who is joined by Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the
panel's senior Republican, would require institutions to hold $2.25
in ``tangible'' or ``real money'' capital for every $100 in loans,
compared with $1.50 in versions of the legislation passed by the
House subcommittee and the full Senate.
   ``Inadequate capital standards simply mean that we let the
industry, once again, roll the dice with the taxpayers' money,'' he
said in a statement prepared for delivery at the caucus.
   Gonzalez is trying to raise the visibility of the complex
capital issue, which is at the heart of President Bush's savings
and loan proposal. In the past, industry lobbyists have heavily
influenced congressional decisions on banking laws because most
voters don't follow the issues.
   With taxpayers picking up the bulk of the 10-year, $157 billion
S&amp;L bailout, however, Gonzalez told his colleagues that `the
decisions will be tough _ and they will be watched.''
   ``The choice may be difficult, but, as Democrats, we had better
be able to say, `When the choice was presented, we sided with the
taxpayers,''' he said.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., predicted, ``The capital standards
are going to look pretty kosher to the president by the time we're
through.''
   ``There's intense lobbying by people in the industry, but I also
think ... there's a view that if the committee votes $100 billion
without a tough bill, sooner or later the public will react,'' said
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who is supporting Gonzalez' capital
amendment.
   However, Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., argued that Gonzalez was
trying to precipitously impose ``lily white, absolutely pure''
standards on S&amp;Ls. He warned that if S&amp;Ls were not permitted to
gradually improve their condition, the government's list of
troubled institutions will swell.
   ``I honestly believe that if we prescribe this medicine for our
troubled financial system, the medicine will be so strong that it
will, if not kill the system, at least exacerbate the problem
multifold,'' he said.
   In addition to raising the tangible capital requirement,
Gonzalez is also trying to tighten two other standards: one
affecting an accounting item known as ``goodwill,''' the other the
treatment of S&amp;L subsidiaries.
   According to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, more than
one-third of the S&amp;L industry's $60 billion in capital consists of
``goodwill,'' an intangible asset representing the value of an
institution's customer loyalty and name recognition.
   The Bush administration is seeking to eliminate ``goodwill''
value over 10 years, arguing that it is ``phantom capital'' and has
no worth when an institution is shut down. The bill passed by
Annunzio's subcommittee would permit goodwill, in some cases, to
remain on institutions' books for as long as 40 years. Gonzalez is
proposing it be phased out over 20 years.
   The Gonzalez plan gives S&amp;Ls five years to come up with extra
capital to back subsidiaries investing in risky areas such as
commercial real estate and junk bonds. The subcommittee bill did
not require the extra capital.
   The Associated Press, based on a staff document, reported Monday
that Gonzalez would permit subordinated debt _ money S&amp;Ls borrow _
to count for up to one-half of an institution's core capital. Aides
explained Tuesday, however, that while subordinated debt will be
permitted in capital, it will not be counted toward meeting the
very minimum, or core, requirement.

<HEAD>Agency Will Tell Court Owl Worthy Of Protection</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said
Tuesday it has dediced after all that the spotted owl is worthy of
protection as a threatened species.
   Environmentalists hope the decision will save the ancient
forests of the Northwest. The timber industry says the move could
lock up vast areas of the region to logging.
   A federal judge in Seattle had given the agency until Monday to
review its decision of more than a year ago not to list the owl
under the Endangered Species Act.
   ``We will present a finding to the court that listing of the owl
as a threatened species is warranted and begin steps to officially
propose it for listing,'' said Meg Durham, a spokeswoman for the
Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Once the owl is proposed for listing as a threatened species, a
year-long review will begin during which management plans for
protection of the bird could be developed and public comment sought.
   Ms. Durham offered no indication when the agency would actually
propose the listing, but said the ``best scientific evidence''
available confirms the owl was worthy of protection.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service in December 1987 refused to list
the owl and environmental groups filed suit. District Court Judge
Thomas Zilly ruled the initial decision not to list the owl was
``arbitrary and capricious'' and gave the agency until May 1 to
review its decision.
   The bird, which is thought to nest only in the old-growth
forests of Washington, Oregon and northern California, has become
the focal point of a raging dispute between environmentalists and
the timber industry.
   Environmentalists have sought to have the owl protected as part
of their campaign to halt logging in the old-growth forests of the
Northwest while the industry has claimed such protection would
close vast areas of the region to logging forcing dozens of mills
to close and the layoff of thousands of workers.
   Court orders in related cases have already put a halt to more
than 140 timber sales in the region's national forests. Forest
Service officals have said those injunctions would interupt half of
the harvest planned in the national forests this year and during
the long-term the harvest could drop by one-third.
   F. Dale Robertson, Forest Service chief, has said under a
``worst case scenario'' more than 31,000 workers could loose their
jobs and his agency's timber receipts from the region could be cut
in half.
   ``They should have done it a year ago, but better late than
never,'' said Mike Anderson of the Wilderness Society, adding his
his group believes listing the owl as an endangered species will
require an end to logging in most of the remaining old-growth
forests of the Northwest.
   Jim Pissot of the National Audubon Society said the decision
gives the Northwest an ``opportunity to focus on some of the real
threats to the timber industry rather than using the spotted owl as
a scapegoat.''
   Ward Armstrong, executive director of the Oregon Forest
Industries Council in Salem, Ore., said the industry was
``disappointed, primarily because we don't believe the facts
warrant it.
   ``We believe there will be ramifications to this decision we
just don't begin to understand yet,'' said Armstrong. ``We believe
it was a grave error.''

   Police Chief Maurice T. Turner, who plans to
retire in July, wants to work for federal drug czar William
Bennett, but on Tuesday he didn't rule out running for mayor of the
District of Columbia.
   Turner, 53, announced he will retire July 31, wrapping up a
32-year career with the police department. He said he had no
immediate future plans.
   On Tuesday, top business officials contemplated drafting Turner
to run in the 1990 mayoral election, while city officials said he
wants to work for Bennett.
   ``Mr. Bennett has not offered me a job,'' Turner said, ``But he
needs people who have been on the working level of a police agency
_ on the ground floor.''
   Asked about a mayoral candidacy, Turner said, ``That's a
possibility. There's nothing to throw out the window.''
   Turner's decision comes after a series of public clashes with
Mayor Marion Barry Jr. involving Turner's requests for more
officers to fight the city's drug problem. Barry initially said the
city had enough officers, but later asked for more personnel.
   However, Turner downplayed any differences with Barry.
   ``Obviously, we did not always agree, but I get along well with
the mayor,'' Turner said.
   Turner, who dealt extensively with Bennett while Bennett was
drawing up a special anti-drug plan for the district, has said
privately that he would accept a job in Bennett's office if it were
offered.
   But Bennett aide Don Hamilton said Tuesday, ``Director Bennett
likes and respects Chief Turner, but there are no current plans to
bring him aboard.''
   Meantime, several members of the Greater Washington Board of
Trade, an influential business leaders' group, said they may start
a movement to draft Turner for mayor.
   The board took the unprecedented step three weeks ago of
criticizing Barry for failing to stop the increase in crime.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador to Greece denied
Tuesday he was interfering in Greek politics after the conservative
opposition party accused him of supporting the governing Socialists.
   A statement issued by the U.S. Embassy in Athens said Ambassador
Robert V. Keeley had steered clear of local politics since he was
assigned to the country 3{ years ago.
   ``Ambassador Keeley has made it the foundation of his service in
Athens ... to make clear to everyone in this country that the
politics of Greece are for the Greek people alone to determine,
that the United States government does not take sides,'' the
statement said.
   The statement came after the conservative New Democracy party
protested a story in The New York Times on Sunday that quoted
Western diplomats and Greek political analysts as saying the party
leader, Constantine Mitsotakis, was less charismatic than Premier
Andreas Papandreou.
   A Western diplomat was also quoted as saying it was not yet
clear who would win the June elections, despite the Papandreou
government's loss of popularity because of allegations that
officials were involved in a multimillion dollar financial scandal.
   New Democracy said the diplomat was American, and it said Greek
journalists recognize ``the American diplomat is none other that
Ambassador Keeley.''
   ``The envoy has not ceased for four years to interfere in an
unfitting way in Greece's domestic affairs by acting as a
propagandist for Andreas Papandreou,'' the conservatives said.
   The conservatives did not, however, provide any evidence for the
accusation.
   The embassy said Keeley had not met Alan Cowell, The New York
Times correspondent that wrote the story, since July 1987.

<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators have cleared the
former inspector general of the veterans administration of
tailoring audit decisions to meet political or administrative
pressure.
   A report from the General Accounting Office said the decisions
of Frank Sato to end audits or not issue reports in nine instances,
and his conclusions in those cases, were exercises of professional
judgment and results of a policy ``not to issue reports that, in
his judgment, would not accomplish a useful purpose.''
   Anonymous complaints from people in Sato's office to Congress
said Sato, inspector general from 1981 to 1988, had not issued
reports or else had changed conclusions in eight cases under
pressure from the agency's administrators, Harry Walters before
1986 or Tom Turnage in 1986-1988.
   The staff of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee asked the
General Accounting Office to examine those eight cases plus one
more it was concerned about.
   ``While not taking a position as to whether the former IG
reached the right decision in each case, we recognize that when
dealing with sensitive, controversial issues, reasonable people
can, and often do, arrive at different conclusions. ... We believe
this is the central issue here,'' said the GAO report dated March
17 and received Tuesday.
   In four cases, Sato wrote a memo to or briefed the
administrator, either Walters or Turnage, or wrote to program
officials about his findings. In five cases the report or other
document was listed as available to the public.
   According to the GAO report, Sato ``said that in sensitive
subject areas, he did not want to create controversy unless it
would lead to improvements'' and expressed frustration about
``recommending that a VA facility not be built, when it was already
determined by the agency and the Congress that the facility was
needed and would be built to help meet the agency's mission,
despite any IG recommendation to the contrary.''
   Sato, now retired, said ``he was never asked or directed by
anyone else, including the VA administrator, to cancel or not issue
an audit report, or to water down a report,'' and all decisions
were his own, the report said.
   Only two of 50 people interviewed in the inspector general's
office believed there was ``an independence problem,'' and those
two did not provide ``evidence to show the former IG was impaired
in his reporting decisions,'' GAO said.
   The GAO report by Jeffrey C. Steinhoff, director of financial
management system issues, said ``in the future, reasons for not
issuing reports should be documented and placed in the (office)
files.''
   New audit standards issued last year require such a memo, and
the acting VA inspector general, Renald Morani, has agreed to
follow such a policy, GAO said.

<TEXT>
   A policeman sentenced to 14 years in
prison for the murder of pro-Solidarity priest Jerzy Popieluszko
has been freed after serving about four years, it was announced
Tuesday.
   Waldemar Chmielewski was one of four security officers convicted
of killing the Roman Catholic priest in 1984 and dumping the body
in the Vistula river north of Warsaw. The three other officers were
given longer sentences and remain in prison.
   Deputy government spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowski said Chmielewski
had been released, but he did not know when he left the
penitentiary.
   He said Chmielewski's sentence expired during the third week in
April. The Supreme Court, citing humanitarian grounds in a 1987
ruling, reduced the sentence to four years.
   Chmielewski was sentenced in February 1985 to 14 years.
   Popieluszko was an active supporter of Solidarity, the
independent union chartered by the communist government in the fall
of 1980 during nationwide strikes.
   Solidarity was suspended by the government in December 1981 and
subsequently outlawed by Parliament. But it was restored as a legal
union federation under an agreement between the government and
opposition groups led by Solidarity founder Lech Walesa earlier
this month.
   Popieluszko became a symbol of Solidarity's struggle, and his
grave at the Warsaw church where he served is a pilgrimage site for
Poles and foreigners.
   Walesa placed flowers on the grave last weekend.

   The countdown began Tuesday for
Friday's launch of space shuttle Atlantis and five astronauts on a
mission to send a payload to Venus and revitalize a U.S. planetary
exploration program.
   The $550 million Magellan-Venus project will mark the end of a
decade-long dry spell for U.S. planet flights and signal the
beginning of a science-rich three-years when four major probes will
be rocketed into deep space.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 2:24 p.m. Friday in a rare afternoon
launch. Only five of the 28 earlier shuttle flights took off after
noon.
   The countdown clock began ticking on time at 8 a.m., when
electrical power surged into the spaceship.
   Test director Terry Willingham reported there were no problems
as the count began. He said work Tuesday included checking computer
software, the main engines and communications systems and closing
out the engine compartment.
   He said the forecast was for clear skies Friday afternoon, but
officials were expressing some concern about the possibility of
strong crosswinds that could interfere with Atlantis if it had to
make an emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad.
   The astronauts flew here late Tuesday from their training base
in Houston to make final preparations for launch.
   Commander Dave Walker told reporters the crew and spacecraft are
ready to fly and that ``we are mighty proud'' to be part of the
first shuttle planetary mission. The other crew members are pilot
Ron Grabe and mission specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman
Thagaard.
   Six hours after Atlantis lifts off, commander Dave Walker and
his astronaut crew will release the 7,600-pound Magellan payload,
propelling it on a 468-day journey to Venus.
   Magellan is to slip into orbit around the cloud-shrouded planet
in August 1990 and map up to 90 percent of its surface during the
following 243 days with a high resolution radar system.
   The images, relayed to Earth and enhanced by computer, could
help scientists understand how Venus was formed and evolved. They
are expected to show features as small as 120 yards across, 10
times sharper than any previous pictures of the planet.
   Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, said it is hoped the expedition will answer
``a major question of why Earth and Venus evolved so differently
even though at the beginning of the solar system they were almost
identical.''
   The surface temperature of Earth's sultry twin is 900 degrees
Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than
that on Earth.
   Magellan is the first new American planetary spacecraft since
Pioneer 13 was launched in 1978, also to Venus. It also is the
first planetary payload to be carried by a shuttle.
   The launch is being hailed as a resurgence of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's planetary science program.
   In October, another Atlantis crew will start the Galileo
spacecraft on the way to Jupiter; in October 1990, the Ulysses
probe will be launched, also from Atlantis, to study the sun, and
in 1992, the Mars Observer craft will be on its way aboard an
unmanned rocket.

   Guards tore down an office
wall at Burroughs Wellcome Co. on Tuesday to remove four men
protesting the cost of the only government-approved drug aimed at
halting the AIDS virus.
   ``We won't let them tell us `Pay or die' any longer,'' said
protester Peter Staley, who has been diagnosed as having
AIDS-related complex and takes the drug, AZT. ``Either they knock
down the cost or they knock down their own walls to get us out.''
   Burroughs Wellcome security guards and Durham County sheriff's
deputies did just that after the four activists from the AIDS
Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACTUP, sealed the door of an
unoccupied office.
   The protesters used small steel plates bolted to the door and
door frame to seal the door. They planned to cut through a window
in the second-floor office and unfurl a banner that would be
visible from nearby Interstate 40.
   While the officers cut through the wall about 30 minutes after
the protest began, the activists chained themselves together inside
the room. The chain was cut before the four men, all wearing suits
and ties, were led out of the company headquarters in handcuffs.
   ``We've been trying to deal with this company for two years,''
Staley said as he was put in a patrol car.
   Staley said the protesters wanted a 25 percent reduction in the
cost of AZT and wanted Burroughs Wellcome to fund a government
program to supply AZT to the needy.
   The drug AZT, marketed by Burroughs Wellcome under the name
Retrovir, costs $8,000 to $10,000 a year. It prevents the virus
that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome from replicating,
but is not a cure for the fatal disease.
   Dan Baker, a spokesman for the New York-based coalition, said
Burroughs Wellcome recovered its development costs for AZT in the
first year it was marketed and was now making an 80 percent profit
on the drug sales.
   ``They could afford to practically give the drug away free,''
Baker said. ``We're not denying that they deserve a profit, but we
say it should be a reasonable profit on a drug people need to stay
alive.''
   Burroughs Wellcome spokeswoman Kathy Bartlett did not deny the
80 percent profit claim, but said the company had never released
profit figures and did not know ``where that information came
from.''
   She said Burroughs Wellcome has given away millions of capsules
of AZT for clinical trials and had donated money to government AIDS
programs.
   ``We understand their actions were motivated by desperation,''
Ms. Bartlett said. ``But it was really misdirected. Burroughs
Wellcome has been working for three years to bring therapy to AIDS
patients.''
   Baker said the group was prepared to pay Burroughs Wellcome for
damages to the office.
   The protest, he said, was ``a desperate act to draw attention to
the AIDS issue. Until they agree to our demands, we will continue
to take these actions. We'll be back.''
   AZT was rushed into production in 1986 after only nine months of
clinical tests, when preliminary results showed 8 percent of the
patients died while taking the drug, compared with 40 percent who
died while taking a placebo. The government waived large-scale
clinical tests after those preliminary results so the drug could be
put into circulation.
   Staley, 28, a former Wall Street bond trader; Lee Arsenault, 41,
a clothing importer from New York who has AIDS; James McGrath, 32,
a dance club owner from Providence, R.I.; and Blane Mosley, 24, a
New York clothing designer, were charged with first-degree
trespassing and damage to property. They were released on $5,000
bond each and face a court appearance May 4.

   Shock TV host Morton Downey Jr. said
Tuesday he was attacked by ``skinheads'' who cut his hair and
marked him with swatiskas, but police said they couldn't verify his
report.
   ``What he's claiming doesn't appear to be the case at all,''
said Ron Wilson, a spokesman at San Francisco International Airport
where the incident was reported at 11:30 p.m. Monday. ``We have not
yet been able to confirm any of the statements Mr. Downey made.''
   Authorities found no evidence of skinheads in the area, he said.
   Wilson said a witness reported seeing the talk show host in a
restroom where the attack was said to have happened, but didn't see
any confrontation. The witness said Downey was escorted to a
waiting limousine by a man and woman with whom he was traveling.
   Downey was cleanly dressed when found in the limousine at the
airport and showed no signs of being in a scuffle, said Wilson.
Scissors and a marking pen were found in the restroom, but there
were no physical signs of a fight, he said.
   In an interview with the San Francisco Examiner, Downey
displayed swastikas scrawled across his face, shirt and pants. His
right eye was bloodshot and bruised, his head partially cut.
   Downey said he was standing in front of a restroom urinal when
someone ``put his arm around my throat and his other hand across my
eyes and dragged me to a stall. They sat me down on the toilet. One
guy sat on me, and another one started cutting my hair.''
   He said they used one of his catch phrases, ``Don't get mad, get
even,'' and told him he now ``was one of them.''
   Downey said he didn't get a good look at his assailants, but
believed them to be skinheads, or young people with shaved heads.
White supremacist skinheads have been reviled on the syndicated
``Morton Downey Jr. Show.''
   According to Downey, his attackers tried to shave his hair and
drew swastikas across his face, sweatshirt and pants.
   Downey _ known for his aggressive, blatantly arrogant approach
to the talk show format _ said one youth punched him, but that he
managed to strike back.
   ``One of them's hurt,'' Downey said. ``I kicked him real good.''
   The incident was reported about two hours after Downey taped a
public service message condemning hate.
   Downey was in San Francisco to promote his show, which is
broadcast weeknights on cable via New Jersey-based WWOR-TV and
aired locally on KOFY-TV.
   About the same time Downey said he was assaulted, a bomb threat
forced KOFY to take the show off the air for half an hour. The
nature of the threat was not known.
   The one-hour series was making its first appearance in San
Francisco since being canceled Sept. 9 by another station, KRON-TV,
after a 13-week trial that was vociferously protested by local gay
activists.
   Downey headed home to Secaucus, N.J., on Tuesday. He said he
wouldn't miss taping any of his shows and won't wear a wig to cover
up his ``haircut.''

   Tass said Tuesday that 29 people were killed by
mudslides in a mountainous area near the Turkish border last week.
   Radio Moscow had reported Friday that 52 people perished when
landslides buried four houses and a bus in the mountains of
Adzharia in the southern republic of Georgia.
   The report by the official Tass agency did not refer to the
previous casualty figures but indicated some of the people feared
killed had survived.
   It quoted geologists in the area as saying that because of rains
the situation ``remains extreme and landslides and mud torrents can
go on the attack again at any moment.''
   The agency said slides have forced more than 3,000 families from
their homes and military helicopters are helping evacuate the
victims and distriblute supplies being contributed from throughout
the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>South African Opposition Tells Defense Minister to Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition spokesmen on
Tuesday urged the defense minister to resign because of a purported
arms deal between Protestant extremists from Northern Ireland and a
South African diplomat.
   The opposition parties also demanded criminal charges against
the diplomat in part to show good faith to Britain, which is upset
because the transaction reportedly involved delivery of spare parts
for its Blowpipe missile launcher.
   French authorities said they took South African diplomat Daniel
Storm into custody last week with an American and three members of
the Ulster Defense Association, the largest paramilitary group in
Northern Ireland. French authorities said they were arrested in a
raid on a hotel room where parts of the British-made missile system
were being delivered to the South African.
   The three Irishmen and the American, identified as Geneva
businessman Douglas Bernhart, are being held on charges of
gun-running and conspiracy. Storm, who is posted in Paris, was
released after claiming diplomatic immunity. Colin Eglin, foreign
affairs spokesman for the moderate opposition Democratic Party,
said if Storm was involved ``in murky arms deals with terrorist
organizations, there is no doubt the minister of defense should
resign.''
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha and Defense Minister Magnus Malan
both have said the government sometimes uses unconventional methods
to obtain arms technology to circumvent a U.N. arms embargo, but
both denied South Africa was supplying arms to any terrorist
organization.
   They have said Storm's activities will be investigated.
   Published reports in Britain say South Africa has supplied arms
to Protestant groups in return for blueprints of the Blowpipe, a
shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile made at Short Brothers, a
factory in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
   The Democratic Party's defense spokesman, Dave Dalling, said
Storm should be charged as soon as he returns to South Africa to
hash out the whole affair in an open court.
   ``Presumably, it is a criminal offense for a South African
citizen to conduct arms dealings with terrorist organizations,''
said Dalling.
   He said such a step would demonstrate to the British government
South Africa's good faith.
   Spokesmen for the right-wing Conservative Party opposition have
also called for a government explanation.
   In London on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told
South Africa's visiting finance minister, Barend Du Plessis, that
he viewed with ``the utmost seriousness'' any supply of arms to
violent groups in Britain's strife-torn province of Northern
Ireland.
   The reports, embarrassing for South Africa, are clouding what
British officials have claimed is a successful policy by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher toward South Africa. She refuses to
impose tough embargoes while pressing the white-controlled
government to share political power with the black majority.
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper in Johannesburg, said,
``Whatever happens now, the incident will affect our credibility as
a country opposed to terrorism in any shape or form.''
   The government accuses the major armed opponent of its apartheid
system of racial segregation, the African National Congress, of
engaging in terrorism.

   The second strong earthquake in nine days hit a
mountainous area of southwest China on Tuesday, destroying a bridge
and causing the top floors of five apartment buildings to collapse,
an official report said.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties from the quake
that struck in Sichuan province's Batang County, near Tibet, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
   In Japan, a moderate earthquake rocked the Tokyo area early
Wednesday, but police had no immediate reports of injuries or
damage.
   The Chinese news agency said Tuesday's quake measured 6.7 on the
Richter scale, the same as an earthquake that hit the same region
April 16. Eleven people were killed in the April 16 earthquake and
its aftershocks.
   Xinhua said a bridge across the Jinsha River was destroyed and
an army vehicle loaded with relief supplies for Batang was damaged
by a landslide.
   The epicenter of the Japanese quake was an estimated 40 miles
below the surface in northern Chiba prefecture, adjoining Tokyo.
   It had a preliminary reading on 5.1 on the Richter scale, the
Central Meteorological Agency said. There was no danger of tsunami,
or huge ocean waves, generated by the quake, the meteorological
agency said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable
damage in the local area. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake,
capable of widespread heavy damage.

<TEXT>
   Panama on Tuesday asked for an emergency
meeting of the Security Council to hear its claim of ``flagrant
intervention'' by Washington in its economy and political system.
   Panama's ambassador to the United Nations, Leonardo Kam,
requested the council meeting. A U.N. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said a meeting might take place later this
week.
   Kam, in a letter, did not specify the cause of the complaint,
referring only to U.S. actions against Panama's ``sovereignty,
political independence, economic security and territorial
independence.''
   U.S. News &amp; World Report said in its May 1 issue that President
Bush secretly approved a $10 million fund for Panamanian opposition
candidates in the May 7 elections.
   Opposition candidate Guillermo Endara on Monday denied receiving
any campaign funds from the United States. Endara is running
against Carlos Duque, who is backed by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
Panama's Defense Forces commander and de facto ruler.
   The opposition has accused Noriega of planning to rig the May 7
vote, in which Panamanians will choose a new president, two vice
presidents, 67 legislators and 510 local representatives.
   The New York Times reported this week that President Reagan
approved a plan to have U.S.-supported Panamanian exiles overthrow
Noriega, but the Senate Intelligence Committee balked at the plan.
   The Times, quoting government officials, reported the Senate
Intelligence Committee rejected the coup plan, however, on grounds
that Noriega might be assassinated. A presidential order forbids
U.S. participation in assassinations.
   Asked about the U.S. News report, White House officials refused
comment, saying it involves covert operations.
   Last year, the Reagan administration imposed economic sanctions
in an attempt to force out Noriega.
   The sanctions were imposed after Noriega was indicted on U.S.
drug trafficking charges in Florida and he orchestrated the ouster
of President Eric Arturo Delvalle. Delvalle had tried to fire
Noriega after the February 1988 indictment.
   Noriega denied the drug charges.
   Noriega has blamed the United States for Panama's economic
problems and accused Washington of trying to renege on a treaty to
transfer control of the Panama Canal to Panama by the end of the
century.

   An Illinois veterinarian and a New
York importer pleaded guilty Tuesday to two felony charges each in
the unlawful importing of unapproved animal drugs.
   Robert Clack of Pittsfield, Ill., and Heinz Dall of Ossining,
N.Y., could be jailed for up to 10 years, with Dall facing fines of
more than $500,000 and Clack up to $260,000.
   Clack pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and another of
making a false statement in the hearing before U.S. District Judge
David Hansen.
   Dall pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge and another stemming
from the importing of the illegal drug chloramphenicol.
   More than a dozen additional charges against both men will be
dropped when they are sentenced July 18.
   Clack, Dall and Jeffery Engel, president of the now defunct
Custom Feed Blenders of Fort Dodge, were charged last November with
conspiring to ship tons of cheap, outlawed toxic drugs from Canada
to animal feed manufacturers and veterinarians throughout the
Midwest. The antibiotics are mixed with feed to prevent the spread
of disease in animals.
   Engel earlier pleaded guilty to three counts.
   Two of the 16 drugs that Clark and Dall were charged with
smuggling into the United States are prohibited from being used in
any food animal, while three are prohibited in hogs or cattle
because of their toxicity.
   The government says four others are carcinogens and one,
chloramphenicol, is a powerful antibiotic which has been linked to
aplastic anemia, a leukemia-like blood disorder.
   Richard Teske, deputy director of the Center for Veterinary
Medicine at the Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, Md., said
that chloramphenicol is so potent that any dose is critical.
   ``If you are sensitive to it, even a very tiny amount would be
enough to trigger this response,'' he said. He said the chemical is
a broad spectrum antibiotic made in China or Eastern European
countries.

   The Communist Party swept out 110 senior officials
_ many thought to be inactive and conservative _ and promoted 24
people Tuesday in a major reshuffle that expands Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's power base to push for reform.
   The party's policy-making Central Committee retired 74 of its
301 full members, including former President Andrei A. Gromyko; 24
non-voting members and 12 members of the Central Auditing
Commission, which handles party finances.
   Party ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev told a news conference
they volunteered to step down and the Central Committee unanimously
approved.
   At a full meeting of the committee, the officials issued a joint
request that referred to President Gorbachev's campaign for
perestroika, or restructuring: ``Now that all comrades on the
Communist Party Central Committee and the Central Auditing
Commission should work hard to further perestroika, it is essential
for us, in the interest of the common cause, to give up (our)
powers.''
   Medvedev remarked, ``This is a serious and important milestone
in our course, perestroika, which shows that our party is
realistically assessing its own work and is quite critical about
its own activities.''
   The resignations followed the first contested, nationwide
elections in 70 years of Communist rule on March 26. Dozens of top
party and government officials, including more than 30 regional
party chairmen, were defeated.
   It was not clear whether Gorbachev had urged the officials to
step aside Tuesday, but portraying their removal as voluntary was a
deft tactical maneuver possibly meant to head off criticism that
they wee ousted.
   The military lost a substantial voice in the Central Committee.
At least nine senior officers were dropped, and just one officer
was promoted from candidate status to full membership.
   The changes left the Central Committee with 251 members, party
personnel chief Georgy P. Razumovsky told the news conference.
   Medvedev said 83 members, or more than one-quarter of the body,
lost the government and party jobs that entitled them to committee
membership since the 27th party cngress elected them in 1986.
Officially, they lost their jobs because of poor health or age, but
some clearly fell from political favor.
   Of the 83, many were removed Tuesday. Medvedev said a few others
were too ill to sign the request.
   Western observers call such inactive officials ``dead souls''
and say they can be a conservative force slowing reforms. The term
was borrowed from Nikolai Gogol's 1842 novel ``Dead Souls'' about a
rogue who buys the names of dead serfs to mortgage them as property.
   Jerry Hough, a political scientist at Duke University in North
Carolina, has said ``dead souls'' are accumulating at a rate of
about 10 percent a year and by 1991, more than half the Central
Committee members would fall into that category.
   All but two of those promoted Tuesday to full membership were
made non-voting members at the 1986 party congress, Gorbachev's
first as general secretary. The reshuffling between party
congresses was extremely rare.
   Among others Gorbachev might like to have on board in the
Central Committee are six men named party leaders in the Baltic
republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, and the Caucasus
republics of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. All are potential
Gorbachev allies but cannot be appointed until a 1991 party
congress.
   The six republics have been wracked by ethnic unrest.
   Gorbachev has complained that opposition to his social and
economic reform program, known as perestroika, extends all the way
to the Central Committee. The body has included many officials who
held spots there long before he became party leader in March 1985.
   In a speech to the Central Committee, the 58-year-old Kremlin
chief praised the retirees for working hard for perestroika.
   ``Many of us had to give up our habits and stereotypes of
thinking. And still, at this time of utmost importance for the
development of our society, the Central Committee rose to the
occasion,'' Gorbachev said.
   But in remarks carried by the Soviet news agency Tass, he added,
``The situation has changed considerably, comrades. Vast changes
have taken place over this period also in state bodies, and this
required personnel changes.''
   Tass said the retirees included Gromyko, who had retired as
president last fall; former Politburo members Geidar A. Aliev and
Mikhail S. Solomentsev and former non-voting Politburo member
Vladimir I. Dolgikh.
   Also dropped were Sergei Sokolov, who was retired as defense
minister in 1987 after West German teen-ager Mathias Rust flew a
plane onto Red Square, and Karen Demirchyan and Kyamran Bagirov,
who lost their jobs as first secretary of the Armenian and
Azerbaijani parties respectively in ethnic unrest last May.
   Among those promoted were Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of
the Soviet Academy of Sciences and thought to be a close Gorbachev
supporter; the ambassador to West Germany, Yuli A. Kvitsinsky, an
arms control expert who negotiated on space weapons with U.S.
officials in Geneva; and Yevgeny Primakov, director of the
Institute of World Economics and International Relations.

   Strong thunderstorms swept across Ohio and West Virginia on
Tuesday, and a spring storm dumped 5 inches of snow on the
mountains of California.
   Golf-ball sized hail clattered on Parkersburg, W. Va., and wind
gusted up to 60 mph at Cleveland's International Airport.
   Intense thunderstorms developed across western Wisconsin and
northeast Iowa, and showers fell across the central Pacific Coast.
   At Reedley, Calif., a small tornado flipped over a carport.
   Five to 6 inches of snow fell over the higher elevations of the
Sierra Nevada. Snow was expected at Yosemite National Park and the
Lake Tahoe area, and in the the southern Cascades of Oregon.
   An inch of snow fell in six hours in Great Falls, Mont.
   Much of the central portion of the nation heated up again, with
readings in the 80s or 90s across the southern Plains, in the
Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast states.
   Record high temperatures for the date were reported in Atlanta,
which tied its mark of 88 degrees set in 1896; Topeka, Kan, with 90
degrees (89 in 1987); and Nashville, with 88 degrees (87 in 1986).
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34
degrees at South Lake Tahoe, Calif., to 92 degrees at Fort Myers,
Fla., and Lubbock, Texas.
   The nation's low Tuesday morning was 17 degrees in South Lake
Tahoe.
   Wednesday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the Plains to the upper Mississippi Valley, the
southern Great Lakes region, the central Appalachians and sections
of the mid-Atlantic Coast. Rain showers were predicted from the
central Pacific Coast to the northern Rockies, with snow at high
elevations in northern Arizona.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 40s and 50s across the
northern Rockies, in North Dakota, the northern Great Lakes and New
England; the 80s and 90s across much of the Plains, the Mississippi
and lower Ohio valleys and the Gulf and southern Atlantic coasts;
and in the 60s and 70s in most of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Defense Secretary Predicts Reforms Will Probably Fail</HEAD>

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Tuesday
predicted ``a very real likelihood'' that Mikhail Gorbachev's
reform plans would fail and the Soviet leader may either be forced
to change course or hand over power.
   Cheney told Congress that as a result, the United States and its
NATO allies must resist the temptation to respond to Gorbachev's
proposals for reducing arsenals and troop strengths and stick to
the policies it has advocated until now.
   Cheney, testifying before the House Armed Services Committee,
said he had watched Gorbachev and had ``become convinced that he
seeks change inside the Soviet Union, but primarily because the
Soviet system has been a failure.''
   However, ``I think it's going to be extremely difficult for him
to succeed, and I think there is a very real likelihood that he'll
either have to reverse course, or that for one reason or another,
ultimately have to resort to force, perhaps in Eastern Europe,
perhaps in terms of dealing with the ethnic unrest inside the
Soviet Union.
   ``And, of course, there's always the possibility that his
successor may arrive fairly soon and may pursue radically different
policies than he has,'' he said.
   In apparent reference to pressure from West Germany for talks
with the Kremlin on reducing short-range nuclear weapons, Cheney
said, ``I think we're in a posture now where people are responding
to what they perceive to be the intentions of the Soviet leadership
rather than what are the capabilities of the Soviet military.
   ``And we don't have the luxury of assuming that the intentions
expressed by Mr. Gorbachev necessarily are going to permanently
become a part of the policies of the Soviet Union,'' he cautioned.
   NATO must ``continue to resist the temptation to react to Mr.
Gorbachev's `proposal of the month' by trying to dismantle, if you
will, some of our own military capabilities or alliance strength.''
   Cheney's comments came as the State Department accused the
Soviet Union of trying to undermine NATO's nuclear defense and
instructed U.S. ambassadors in Western capitals to counter the West
German drive for negotiations.
   The U.S. offensive is designed to rally the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization against any reduction in nuclear battlefield
weapons before President George Bush meets with the 15 allied
leaders in Brussels at the end of May.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, trying to counter growing
support for disarmament in his country, sent Defense Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher to
Washington for talks to try to persuade the Bush administration tn
negotiate with the Soviets over the missiles.
   Cheney said that ``having spent yesterday negotiating'' with
Stoltenberg and Genscher over the Kremlin proposal and NATO's plans
for modernizing short-range Lance missiles in Europe, he is
convinced that ``now more than ever, the alliance requires strong
leadership.''
   The United States will provide an example, he said, by
maintaining its current troop strength in Europe _ about 350,000 _
despite budgetary pressures at home to bring some forces home.
   ``I would hope that eventually it will indeed be possible to
take down some of those forces that are currently stationed over
there and to restructure our military forces accordingly but I
don't believe the summer of l989 is the time to do it,'' he said.

   The federal agency overseeing the nation's
futures markets on Tuesday recommended against increasing penalties
for violating trading laws and called for more study on other
suggested reforms.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in response to
questions posed by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said it ``does not
believe that proposals for treble damages and punitive damages
would significantly enhance deterrence of violative conduct.''
   Leahy, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, is
exploring proposals to tighten regulation of futures markets in the
wake of revelations that the FBI has conducted a two-year
undercover investigation of alleged abuses at the two largest
futures exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Leahy's panel, and its counterpart in the House, have been
conducting hearings into the matter and on whether or not Congress
should extend the CFTC's authorization to continue operating after
Sept. 30.
   The commission did not recommend increased penalties but it
recommended removing a requirement that it consider a firm or
trader's financial condition before levying a penalty.
   The commission, chaired by Wendy L. Gramm, said the exchanges
themselves should increase their surveillance programs, but noted
that a number were already doing so.
   It said Congress should increase the agency's staff by 20
positions, but recommended against changing the rules to offer
higher pay to attract more qualified professionals. Instead, the
CFTC said pay should be raised across-the-board for professional
positions in the federal government.
   It said it would support increasing the physical presence of
CFTC on exchange floors, but said it was reviewing its staff to
determine if that could be done without hurting other efforts.
   In another area, the CFTC said it plans to monitor the
composition of the boards that govern the exchanges to ensure that
the public, in addition to floor traders, are adequately
represented.

<HEAD>Weekly Publishes 8-Page Cover Story On Late Cardinal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A weekly published what was believed to
be the first detailed report on the late Cardinal Josef Mindszenty
and his show trial for treason, incarceration and seclusion in the
U.S. diplomatic mission.
   In its latest issue, Idea carried a front-page photo showing the
cardinal praying in front of an altar.
   Idea was formerly the publication of the Hungarian Communist
Youth League, which is now defunct. It now refers to itself as ``a
political weekly.''
   Displaying a degree of press freedom unthinkable only months
ago, Idea carried an eight-page report that included an account of
Mindszenty's trial.
   It also made frequent references to his memoirs and printed a
speech Hungary's Roman Catholic prelate made on Nov. 3, 1956, a day
before Soviet tanks quashed a popular uprising against Soviet rule.
   In the speech, the cardinal said the main aim of the Hungarians
should be the ``revitalization of the nation'' and demanded ``an
all-out effort of the entire country for progress.''
   Mindszenty also said, ``Hungary's fate will be decided by what
the Russian Empire decides to do. We didn't attack Russia, and we
hope that Russian troops will be withdrawn from Hungary.''
   However, it took almost 33 years for the Soviets to begin a
withdrawal. A first batch of Soviet tanks were pulled out Tuesday,
starting a partial pullout of 10,000 Red Army soldiers.
   Mindszenty was arrested in 1948 as an enemy of communism and,
following a humiliating trial, was sentenced to life in prison on
trumped-up charges of high treason.
   In 1956, he was freed from prison by Hungarian revolutionaries.
After the Soviets crushed the uprising, Mindszenty found shelter in
the U.S. mission in Budapest until 1971, when he left under an
agreement worked out between the Vatican and Hungary.
   After a short stay in Rome, Mindszenty settled in Vienna, where
he died in 1975 at age 83.
   Konrad Szanto, a Franciscan and historian, was quoted by the
magazine as saying there were increasing signs of a broad demand
for the rehabilitation of Mindszenty along with others, who were
imprisoned on similar phony charges.
   Last month, Imre Pozsgay, a Politburo member and leading party
reformer, said Mindszenty's trial would be reviewed as part of the
re-examination of all political trials in Hungary between 1945 and
1962.

<TEXT>
   At least five gunmen fired repeatedly at a
Turkish diplomat's house in the Iranian city of Oroumieh but
inflicted no casualties, the Foreign Ministry announced on Tuesday.
   It said the attack occurred Monday at the residence of Selami
Demirbas, the administrative attache at the Turkish Consulate in
Oroumieh, and Demirbas and his wife were inside the house at the
time.
   The Iranian charge d'affaires was summoned to the Foreign
Ministry Tuesday, told of Turkey's concern and asked that Iran
guarantee the safety of Turkish diplomats in that country, the
statement said.
   Foreign Ministry officials declined to speculate on the
identities of the attackers in Oroumieh in northwestern Iran near
the Turkish border. But a government source, speaking on condition
he not be identified, said the attack might have been carried out
by Armenians.
   Many Armenians commemorate on April 24 the massacre of more than
1 million Armenians in Turkey during World War I.
   Turkish and Iranian relations became strained this month when
Iran's fundamentalist Islamic government officially objected to a
Turkish constitutional court decision barring Turkish university
women from wearing Islamic-style headdresses.
   Both countries are predominantly Moslem but Turkey became a
secular state when the republic was formed in 1923 following the
disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. Religous courts were
abolished in 1924 and Islam ceased to be the official state
religion in 1928.
   Turkey accused Iran this month of interfering in its internal
affairs and recalled its ambassador from Tehran for consultations.
   Iran then called home its ambassador to Turkey.

<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of workers at the country's
Central Bank went on strike Tuesday, and a bank spokesman said
foreign debt payments and other financial transactions were
jeopardized.
   The Central Bank strike broke out as other government bank
employees and workers at private banks entered the sixth day of a
separate strike.
   Murilo Murca de Carvalho, a Central Bank spokesman, said by
telephone from Brasilia that ``a significant number'' of the bank's
7,000 workers around the country stopped work.
   Nanci Toffoli, a spokeswoman for the Central Bank Workers Union
in Sao Paulo, said at least 5,000 workers across the country joined
the strike.
   Carvalho said the strike was ``already causing difficulties and
could eventually force our operations to come to a standstill.''
   The Central Bank, Brazil's equivalent of the U.S. Federal
Reserve, controls short-term market investments, the domestic money
supply, government bond trading, foreign exchange operations, and
investments of Brazil's hard currency reserves in the international
financial market.
   The strike could affect Brazil's foreign debt payments,
depending on how long it lasts, Carvalho said without elaborating.
   Brazil, the largest nation in Latin America, is the third
world's largest debtor nation. It has a foreign debt of $115
billion.
   Central Bank workers are federal employees who earn salaries
averaging $680 a month. They are demanding a 150 percent pay
increase to keep pace with annual inflation of more than 1,000
percent.
   The other strike, involving government and private workers,
closed 15 percent of the country's banking institutions, according
to Adilson Lorente, spokesman for the Brazilian Banking Federation.
The spokesman said by phone that 20 percent of about 700,000
Brazilian bank workers were on strike.
   However, the national strike command said at least 75 percent of
the bank workers joined the work stoppage.
   These bank workers earn salaries ranging from $145 a month to
about $1,400 a month. The banks have offered a 29 percent wage
increase, but the strikers want 81 percent.

<HEAD>South African Military Begins Returning to Base</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South African soldiers and Namibian
police began returning to their bases Tuesday to give black
nationalist guerrillas free passage back across the border into
Angola, Defense Force spokesmen said.
   The soldiers and the police counterinsurgency units of the South
African-controlled territory, also known as South-West Africa, are
to remain on base from Wednesday evening through Saturday morning.
   Since Monday night, radio stations, aircraft and police vehicles
have been broadcasting recorded messages from the South-West
African People's Organization, telling guerrillas in the northern
Namibian bush that from 6 p.m. Wednesday, only U.N. forces will be
watching the border.
   The government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said more
than half of the 1,600 guerrillas who crossed into the territory
April 1 have gone back. Only a dozen have appeared at
U.N.-monitored assembly points and churches because of the
proximity of South African military and South-West African police
forces.
   A week and a half of fighting after the incursion cost more than
300 lives and endangered the United Nations independence plan
intended to lead to elections in November, which SWAPO is favored
to win.
   South African officials said Tuesday that the 60-hour safe
passage period this week will be SWAPO's last chance to get its
fighters out of the territory and into U.N.-monitored bases in
Angola, from where they will return, unarmed, to participate in the
elections.
   SWAPO guerrillas have fought since 1966 to end South Africa's
74-year rule over Namibia. SWAPO officials have said their
guerrillas were trying to go to U.N.-supervised bases in Namibia on
April 1, when South African forces were already confined to base.
There was no arrangement for U.N.-supervised bases for SWAPO, which
has fought a guerrilla war from bases in Angola.
   U.N. spokesman Cedric Thornberry said 185 of the 231 U.N. police
monitors in the country would be in place in northern Namibia by
Wednesday and some would be accompanying the South-West African
police on their normal patrols.
   He said 3,723 of the 4,500 allocated military monitors are in
the country, and he expected the rest of the 500 police monitors to
be on hand by May 6.

   Federal agents seized 1,760 pounds of cocaine
during raids in northern Mexico and arrested 12 people suspected of
planning to smuggle the drug into the United States, prosecutors
said Tuesday.
   The attorney general's office, which provided details in a

and a Colombian. They are suspected of flying the drug into Mexico
from the Colombian city of Barranquilla.
   The raids took place Saturday through Monday in Torreon, capital
of Coahuila state; and in Las Delicias, in neighboring Chihuahua
state, according to the statement.
   Federal agents also confiscated three pistols, one rifle, two
trucks, and 13 drums of jet fuel, the prosecutors said.
   There were no immediate details about any charges against the
suspects or the value of the confiscated drugs.

   A B-1B bomber made an emergency
landing without incident Tuesday afternoon at Luke Air Force Base
west of Phoenix because of electrical problems on a training
flight, officials said.
   Base spokesman Bill McKenzie said the aircraft was based at
Ellsworth AFB outside Rapid City, S.D. However, he said he did not
know if the flight originated there.
   Built in 1941 to train fighter pilots, Luke is a Tactical Air
Command base with no bomber squadrons. However, McKenzie said the
B-1 had no problem setting down on one of two 10,000-foot-long
runways about 12:50 p.m.
   He said officials did not know whether weapons were aboard, or
what type they might be. The supersonic, four-jet plane has a
137-foot wingspan and is capable of ``unrefueled, intercontinental
flights,'' said Lt. Col Chris Weber, Luke's public information
officer.
   He said the plane has a four-man crew.
   McKenzie said the plane landed because of an in-flight
emergency, which can range from an instrument-panel signal to
structural damage.
   ``It could be a multitude of things, and of course we don't know
what the malfunction was right at this time,'' McKenzie said.
   Maricopa County sheriff's deputies began closing streets east of
the base about 30 minutes before the landing, but Air Force
officials said they did not ask for such action.

<TEXT>
   A key figure in two
federal investigations involving Washington Mayor Marion Barry was
convicted Tuesday of drug trafficking stemming from an undercover
FBI operation.
   An eight-woman, four-man jury deliberated for 90 minutes before
finding former Virgin Islands government consultant Charles Lewis
guilty of all four drug counts against him. The U.S. District Court
trial took two days.
   Lewis, 48, was charged with two counts of drug possession and
two counts of distribution in the sale of $550 worth of crack, a
cocaine derivative, to undercover FBI agents last month.
   U.S. Attorney Richard Harris said each count carries a maximum
sentence of 20 years and $1 million.
   Chief U.S. District Court Judge David V. O'Brien set sentencing
for June 14 and released Lewis on unsecured bond of $10,000. Lewis
left the courtroom accompanied by his brother and sister.
   Lewis had pleaded innocent but did not testify.
   Lewis faces 10 felony charges in Washington in a separate case
in which District of Columbia police reportedly were called off an
attempted drug buy from Lewis while Barry was visiting his hotel
room in the city.
   A federal grand jury is looking into the circumstances of
Barry's visit to the hotel.
   A second investigation involving Lewis and Barry focuses on the
District of Columbia's joint personnel project with the Virgin
Islands last year. Lewis headed the $266,000 project for the U.S.
territory until he was fired by Gov. Alexander Farrelly in April
1988 because of cost overruns.
   In the current case, the FBI accused Lewis of selling 0.12
ounces of crack worth $550 to two undercover agents March 2 and 3
at a luxury hotel on St. Thomas, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   Special FBI agent Mary Ann Krauss, who allegedly bought crack
from Lewis with agent Joan Burns, testified that the FBI believed
Lewis had been using and selling cocaine for a long time.
   ``The purpose of the undercover operation was to prove or
disprove Mr. Lewis' association with drugs,'' she said.
   The agent said she and Ms. Burns were introduced to Lewis March
2 by a Patricia Teal, identified in court only as a ``cooperating
citizen,'' and bought two $25 bags of crack the same day.
   Ms. Krauss said arrangements were made to buy $500 worth of
crack and a $15 pipe for smoking the drug to be delivered to a room
at the Frenchmen's Reef Hotel.
   ``Our scenario was to suggest a party to Lewis,'' the agent
testified.
   Defense attorney Leonard Francis argued that the FBI used female
agents to entice Lewis into the illegal drug transaction.
   ``Was it coincidence that Lewis that there were three people _
three ladies _ awaiting him to see if he can buy drugs?'' Francis
asked the jury.
   Before closing arguments Tuesday, however, Judge O'Brien denied
a defense motion to dismiss the case on ground of entrapment.
   Psychiatrist Olaf Hendricks, testifying for the defense, said
Lewis told him he was a longtime abuser of alcohol and was
psychologically addicted to crack.
   O'Brien told the jury that drug addiction could not be cited as
a reason for acquittal.

   A judge Tuesday overturned the murder
conviction of a former migrant farm worker in the poisoning deaths
of his seven children, freeing the 53-year-old man after 21 years
in prison.
   Retired Circuit Judge Clifton Kelly released James Richardson,
53, to the custody of defense attorney Ellis Rubin of Miami.
   The decision came after an extraordinary appeal in which both
Rubin and special prosecutor Janet Reno agreed that Richardson, a
black man who was convicted by an all-white jury, had been
railroaded.
   ``Within my heart, I knew that these great men were going to get
me out _ they weren't going to let me stay in there,'' the
gray-haired Richardson, flanked by his attorneys, told The
Associated Press. ``Right now, I feel fine.''
   Richardson was convicted in 1968 of murdering his oldest child,
an 8-year-old daughter, and sentenced to death. His sentence was
later commuted to life imprisonment.
   ``This court is now convinced that the defendant did not receive
a fair trial,'' Kelly told a packed courtroom in the DeSoto County
Courthouse.
   ``There is a definite possibility of a different outcome in the
trial'' if material that the defense should have had access to had
been provided by the prosecution, he said.
   The judge denied defense attorney Mark Lane's motion to dismiss
the charge, saying the state would decide later whether to retry
the case.
   Reno, however, said the charges would be dropped within about 10
days.
   Richardson's attorneys said they were thrilled.
   ``We have shown the world there is justice in Florida,'' said
Rubin.
   Richardson's wife, Annie Mae, cried when she heard the judge's
decision. She raised her arms to the heavens and said, ``Thank you,
thank you.''
   Gov. Bob Martinez, who had appointed Reno to review the case,
said the evidence justified Richardson's release.
   ``Mr. Richardson has lost too many years of his life in prison,
but my hope is that this decision will give him an opportunity to
rebuild,'' Martinez said in Tallahassee, the capital.
   Kelly spent the day listening to arguments from three sides:
Richardson's defense attorneys, the former prosecutor who brought
the case in 1968, and the special prosecutor. He deliberated about
30 minutes before making his ruling.
   Lane had argued that the state attorney and the DeSoto County
sheriff at the time of the trial railroaded Richardson by
manufacturing and encouraging perjured testimony and by withholding
essential evidence from the defense.
   Now, the state and the defense ``both say the judgment of
conviction must be vacated,'' said Lane, a Washington, D.C., lawyer
and author who first alleged a frame-up in the case in his 1971
book ``Arcadia.''
   Ms. Reno, a state attorney from Miami, agreed with some of
Lane's conclusions that the prosecution and the sheriff had aided
in violating the defendant's right to an impartial trial.
   She said former State Attorney Frank Schaub and then-Assistant
State Attorney John Treadwell had withheld ``six key pieces of
exculpatory evidence ... that could have changed the outcome.''
   Schaub, who has said he remains convinced of the defendant's
guilt, denied the use of perjured testimony or the withholding of
key information.
   He accused Ms. Reno of ``a hatchet job'' and said she and her
staff had ``little respect for the truth'' in their zeal to free
``a child-killer.''
   The ex-state attorney called himself the ``last remaining
protector of the rights of these poor, young defenseless
children.'' He is suing Lane and Rubin for alleged defamation of
character.
   Lane charged that Schaub, Treadwell and then-Sheriff Frank Cline
forced jail inmates and others to testify against Richardson and
suppressed evidence favorable to the defendant.
   Lane said Cline was friendly to Bessie Reese, the babysitter who
originally came under suspicion in the poisoning case, and lied to
protect her. Cline was with Ms. Reese on the morning in 1967 when
Richardson' children were fed lunch laced with parathion, a
since-banned deadly insecticide, Lane said.
   Ms. Reese, who is in her late 60s and is immobile in a nursing
home, has confessed to nurses to the deaths, according to an

prosecutors have said she has become confused.
   Kelly, 71, was appointed from retirement by the Florida Supreme
Court to hear the arguments.
   The case has drawn intense attention in the area and security
was heavy at the courthouse.

<TEXT>
   British and U.S. aviation authorities on Tuesday
ordered checks on British Aerospace 146 jets, which are used here
by Queen Elizabeth II, after cracks were discovered in their
American-built jet engines.
   The Civil Aviation Authority and the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration issued the order after the cracks were discovered
when the engines were stripped down in the United States, British
authorities said.
   The CAA said compressor discs connecting with the turbine fan
blades were found cracked in the U.S.-built Avco Lycoming ALF-502
engines of the British Aerospace 146 jets.
   It ordered airlines using the plane to strip down and inspect
the discs within the next 250 flights.
   Two of the four-engine BAe-146 planes are in the Queen's Flight,
as the royal aircraft are collectively known. The queen flew to
China in a BAe-146 in 1986.
   The 100-seat BAe-146 is a steady seller to airlines around the
world, with many used on short commuter routes in the United States
and 10 in China.

<TEXT>
   American TV evangelist Pat Robertson
said Tuesday that Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government is
willing to stop accepting Soviet military aid and slash the size of
its army under a regional peace plan.
   Robertson said Vice President Sergio Ramirez also told him
Nicaragua would let neutral observers inspect its military
installations and allow international monitors at the borders.
   ``I'm not an official of the United States government, nor do I
speak for them,'' Robertson told a news conference. ``But it would
appear to me as a private citizen that if the Nicaraguan government
agrees to a comprehensive arms settlement, and if such a settlement
is accompanied by truly valid verification procedures, such a
proposal would be warmly received by the Bush administration.''
   Nicaragua's presidential press office told The Associated Press
it would seek verification from Ramirez's office of what Robertson
told reporters.
   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said the embassy had no comment
because Robertson was on a private visit.
   Neither Robertson nor Ramirez issued statements when they met at
Ramirez's office Monday night.
   When Roberton sought the Republican presidential nomination last
year, he strongly supported U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua, known
as Contras. In 1985, he called the Contras an ``army of God.''
   President Daniel Ortega left on a 10-nation European tour
Saturday seeking financial help for Nicaragua, in an economic
crisis with hyperinflation and declining production.
   Several European countries have said further aid depends on
Nicaragua's efforts toward democratization and free and fair
general elections next Feb. 25.
   Ortega on Tuesday addressed a session of the European Parliament
in Brussels, Belgium, and invited the parliamentarians to send
observers to monitor Nicaragua's electoral process up to and
including the February voting.
   He pledged fair and open elections and defended a new electoral
law which his foes at home denounced as undemocratic.
   ``I extend a formal invitation to the European Parliament to
send a team of observers ... so they get to know the whole
political situation in the country,'' Ortega said.
   However, a group of about 40 people, including opposition party
members, gathered in Managua on Tuesday to protest the government's
electoral reforms.
   Violeta Chamorro, publisher of the opposition daily La Prensa,
said the reforms violate accords that Ortega made last February
with other regional leaders. ``This is a first violation of those
accords. This law is a fraud,'' she said.
   The opposition says the new law does not give it equal access to
media outlets. It also says the reforms give the Sandinistas
control of the Supreme Electoral Council.
   Robertson came to Nicaragua Monday for the resumption of a
Spanish-language version of his evangelical TV show ``700 Club,''
which last broadcast here in August 1979, a month after the
Sandinistas rose to power.
   ``The principal reason of my visit is religious,'' Robertson
said. ``Nevertheless, in my meeting with the vice president, in
answer to my questions he said, speaking for the government of
Nicaragua, that he was prepared to accept as part of a Central
American peace initiative reductions in the Nicaraguan army to
25,000 men.''
   Estimates of the size of Nicaragua's armed forces run as high as
123,000 men. Robertson later said Ramirez gave no time frame for
effecting these reductions.
   Ramirez also said Nicaragua would accept ``international
monitors of Nicaragua's borders to ensure no traffic in arms or
combatants in or out of Nicaragua or any other countries in Central
America,'' according to Robertson.
   Washington has accused Nicaragua of supplying arms to leftist
guerrillas in El Salvador, separated by only 25 miles by the Gulf
of Fonseca.
   ``The vice president indicated he would agree to international
inspections by neutral observers of Nicaraguan military equipment
and installations,'' Robertson added.
   ``He also indicated to me that as part of a Central American
peace plan, the government would agree to complete cessation by
Nicaragua of accepting Soviet arms and equipment.''
   Ortega and the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica
and Guatemala signed an accord last Feb. 14 that calls for
electoral and other reforms in Nicaragua. They also agreed to come
up with a plan by May 15 to dismantle the Contras.
   About 11,000 Contras and their relatives have dwelt in Honduran
jungle camps since March 1988, when Contra and Sandinista leaders
signed a cease-fire. Earlier, the U.S. Congress cut off military
aid to the Contras.

   Guests sipped champagne and ate a
candlelight dinner in the shadow of a huge trash heap Tuesday to
celebrate the opening of a modern recycling center.
   About 300 people, including Gov. Edward D. DiPrete, watched the
first plastic and glass bottles and jugs travel up conveyor chutes
to be crushed and granulated at the facility. The dusty, smelly
hills of the Central Landfill, New England's largest dump, loomed
in the background.
   Some of the guests then munched hors d'oeuvres and sipped
champagne at a tent nearby as the candlelight dinner was prepared
in this Providence suburb.
   ``This is the most automated recycling facility in the
country,'' said Stephen A. Katz, a recycling manager for CRInc.,
the company running the plant. The center also has the highest
volume of any in the country, he said.
   ``We took recycling out of the sweatshop and put it into an
efficient assembly-line environment,'' Katz said. The new plant
employs eight sorters and 12 office staff, equipment operators and
maintenance workers.
   The plant can process 140 tons of recyclables per eight-hour
shift, while systems in other states process up to 60 tons a day
with more than 20 employees, he said.
   The recycling plant will reduce the dump's garbage intake by
40,000 tons per year, Katz said.
   He stood near a display of soda and soup cans, a ketchup bottle
and two tennis balls, all products of recycling. The fuzzy material
on the outside of the tennis balls came from recycled plastic, Katz
said.
   About a third of Rhode Island's communities are recycling,
putting blue boxes filled with aluminum cans and plastic and glass
bottles on their curbsides and leaving newspapers in paper bages.
   Mandatory recycling is to begin within a few years in the state.
Such measures also are under consideration in New York and other
cities hard-pressed to dispose of their waste.

<TEXT>
   Andre Previn resigned Tuesday as music
director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic amid reports of clashes
with his boss, but will continue as a guest conductor for the next
three seasons.
   ``In the current structure of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, it
has become obvious to me there is no room for a music director,''
Previn, 60, told the board, according to a release from the
philharmonic.
   The philharmonic, however, said a search for a new music
director would begin immediately.
   Previn, who became music director in 1985, had two years left on
his contract. His resignation was effective at the end of the
season.
   He had clashed with Music Center director Ernest Fleischmann
over everything from guest conductors on recordings and how Previn
edited musical works to cutbacks on office supplies and coffee, the
Herald Examiner reported Tuesday.
   ``Nonetheless, because of my love for the orchestra, I am
perfectly happy to continue making music with them,'' Previn said
in the statement. He said he planned to conduct the Philharmonic
for seven weeks next season and six weeks each for the 1990-1991
and 1991-1992 seasons.
   Previn also will take up the baton for some recordings, a May
1990 U.S. tour, and for the opening concert of the Carnegie Hall
centennial season in September 1990.
   A message seeking comment was left for Fleischmann, but there
was no immediate response.
   Michael J. Connell, president of the Philharmonic Association's
board of directors, said Previn's resignation was accepted with
regret.
   Previn, an Academy Award-winning composer and conductor, stepped
down as the Pittsburgh Symphony's music director to take the Los
Angeles post, replacing Carlo Maria Giulini.
   It was a triumphant return to Los Angeles for Previn, whose
parents brought him to the city in 1939 after fleeing Nazi Germany.
He began his composing career at MGM studios at age 16, and
eventually wrote scores for more than 30 movies.
   He won Oscars for ``Gigi'' (1958), ``Porgy and Bess,'' (1959),
``Irma La Douce,'' (1963) and ``My Fair Lady,'' (1964).
   He also has won seven Grammys from the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences, has recorded on several labels, and
led many of the top orchestras of the United States and Europe.
   During his tenure as music director, the philharmonic recorded
10 records, toured Japan and many Western cities, and made East
Coast appearances at Carnegie and Avery Fisher halls in New York
and the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.
   Previn also reorganized the philharmonic's Chamber Music
Society, and appeared as pianist in nine of the chamber's
performances at the University of Judaism's Gindl Auditorium.
   One of Previn's original compositions was performed each season
during his directorship, including ``Principals For Orchestra,
Every Good Boy Deserves Favor,'' a piece for actors and orchestra
written with playwright Tom Stoppard.

<HEAD>Friends Bid Farewell to Cuban Envoy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several hundred friends, associates and
diplomatic colleagues said goodbye Tuesday to Cuban envoy Ramon
Sanchez Parodi, who said the lack of ``a political will'' is
blocking improved relations between his country and the United
States.
   At a buffet reception given by Sanchez Parodi in the ornate old
Cuban Embassy building on 16th Street, the departing envoy offered
scant hope of warmer U.S.-Cuban relations under President Bush.
   Asked about the prospects, he replied, ``That is for the
administration to say, not for us.''
   ``There is a need for a political will to improve relations,''
said Sanchez Parodi, who leaves Thursday to become Cuban's deputy
foreign minister after nearly 12 years as Fidel Castro's diplomatic
representative in Washington.
   He will be succeeded by Jose Antonio Arbezu, vice chairman of
the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party for American
affairs, who is scheduled to arrive in May.
   Among those offering best wishes to Sanchez Parodi in his new
post were Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y.; Mrs. Claiborne Pell, wife of the
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Washington
lawyer R. Sargent Shriver, who also is chairman of Special Olympics
International.
   Shriver, a Democratic vice presidential candidate in 1972, said
he thanked Sanchez Parodi for Cuba's participation in Special
Olympics athletic games for the mentally retarded and handicapped
for the past eight years.
   ``This gentleman has been very helpful in maintaining good
working relations between the Special Olympics and the Cuban
government,'' Shriver said. ``I'm just here to wish him well in his
new job.''
   Although Sanchez Parodi was invited to several White House
social events during the Carter administration after he opened a
small Cuban diplomatic mission here in the summer of 1977, he was
given the deep freeze during President Reagan's eight years in
office.
   No Bush administration official attended the Cuban mission's
farewell party for Sanchez Parodi, who had been officially snubbed
by the White House and the State Department throughout the Reagan
administration.
   His last invitation to a White House social event was when he
attended a reception for the Washington diplomatic corps shortly
after Reagan took office in January 1981.
   Sanchez Parodi refused comment on a memorandum that Secretary of
State James A. Baker III sent to U.S. diplomatic posts last month
in which he declared that improved relations with Cuba were
impossible until Cuba stops fomenting subversion in the Western
Hemisphere and supporting Soviet expansionism.

   Judges hoping to find an opening line to
rise to the literary heights of `It was a dark and stormy night
...' will approach their task fortified by soggy potato chips and
cheap wine.
   Judging of the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest is about to
begin, and the poor souls faced with the brain-numbing task of
poring over thousands of convoluted, clumsy or just plain bad
entries need something else to turn their stomachs.
   Scott Rice, the San Jose State University English professor who
started the contest eight years ago, calls it a ``literary sting
operation to expose the world's wretchedest writers,'' to flash a
``spotlight on the seamy underside of literature.''
   ``This year, we've gotten a lot of entries from places like New
Zealand and Australia ... the people Down Under have taken a big
interest in the contest,'' said Rice.
   Rice said he goes over the entries before the judging and tosses
out anything too well written. After all, you've got to keep up
(down?) the standards of a rotten writing contest, he said.
   Appropriately, judges will be energized by ``soggy potato chips
and cheap wine.'' Results will be announced May 5.
   The contest is named for Lord Edward George Earle Bulwer-Lytton,
who, with a leap of timeless turgidity, wafted to literary
immortality with the opening, ``It was a dark and stormy night ...''
   The central rule of the contest is to ``write the opening
sentence to the worst possible hypothetical novel in any genre they
choose,'' like this entry from Conroe, Texas:
   ``Like an over-ripe beefsteak tomato rimmed with cottage cheese,
the corpulent remains of Santa Claus lay dead on the hotel floor.''
   Or, from, Coral Gables, Fla.:
   ``Jake liked his women the way he liked his kiwi fruit: sweet
yet tart, firm-fleshed yet yielding to the touch, and covered with
short, brown, fuzzy hair.''
   If those deliciously rotten examples fail to bring a tear, maybe
this slippery gem from Washington, D.C., will do the job: ``Her
mouth said, `No-no-no,' but every other inch of her throbbing,
glistening body said `yes-yes-yes,' except for her pancreas ...''
   The first competition in the unlikely contest drew only six
entries, to a high point of 20,000 entries from around the globe
three years ago.
   Rice said he created the contest to provoke San Jose State
students to approach writing playfully and with a sense of whimsy.
A campus literary organization is named the Bulwer-Lytton
Undergraduate Society.
   ``We try to promote the philosophy that people should approach
the language recreationally as well as practically,'' the professor
said.

   The creator of a large photograph of a
crucified Christ submerged in urine said Tuesday his critics were
flattering the work by creating a furor over it.
   An organization in Tupelo has condemned the federal and private
funding of the artist and an exhibit of his work, saying it
reflected bigotry against Christians.
   The creator of ``Piss Christ'' was a winner in The Awards in the
Visual Arts funded by The Rockefeller Foundation, the Equitable
Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.
   The American Family Association said Monday that tax dollars
should not have gone toward the $15,000 award for the artist,
Andres Serrano. His was one of 10 such awards last year.
   ``The person at the National Endowment for the Arts responsible
for approving federal tax dollars for promotion of the `work of
art' should be fired,'' said the Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, a United
Methodist minister who heads the Tupelo-based association.
   Wildmon said the Equitable Foundation, a section of Equitable
Life Assurance Society of the United States, and the Rockefeller
Foundation ``owe Christians a public apology and assurance that
they will not be a party to such anti-Christian bigotry in the
future.''
   Serrano said Tuesday from New York that he expected some
opposition to his work, primarily because of the title.
   ``I feel when people attack a work of art to such a great
extent, they imbue it with a far greater power than when they
ignore it and, in that, I'm flattered that they think it deserves
such attention.''
   As winner of the stipend, the artist selects a work for a
national tour. The 38-year-old New York artist said ``Piss
Christ,'' the piece he selected for tour, was a limited edition of
four prints. One print, he said, already has been sold to a private
collector for $3,600. The work is not currently on exhibit.
   Joseph Slye, a National Endowment for the Arts spokesman,
defended the award.
   ``Expression not prohibited by federal law is protected by the
First Amendment,'' he said. ``Moreover, the endowment is expressly
forbidden in its authorizing legislation from interfering with the
artistic choices made by its grantees.
   ``The national Endowment for the Arts supports the right of
grantee organizations to select, on artistic criteria, their
artist-recipients and present their work, even though sometimes the
work may be deemed controversial and offensive to some
individuals,'' Slye said. ``We at the endowment do, none the less,
deeply regret any offense to any individual.''
   Stefan Stux, owner of the Stux gallery in New York which handles
Serrano's works, said the photograph was created by immersing an
image of the crucified Christ in a glass container of ``urine he
had collected from himself.''
   ``When you look at it, you would never know that, all you can
see is the image of Jesus Christ in a kind of hazy, yellowish mist,
a kind of poetical image. If you did not know the title of it, you
could be very enraptured by the beauty of it. It is very pleasing,
poetic and spiritual.''
   He said the artist uses other body fluids in his art, including
blood. ``He was born in the Christian faith, he feels very much a
part of that,'' Stux said. ``He has deep religious feelings, but he
does not express them exactly the way every other guy does.''
   Rockefeller Foundation president Peter Goldmark said in New
York: ``I respect the right of any individual to object to a work
of art, and the parallel right of artists to express themselves and
of exhibitors to show works that they deem interesting and
meritorious artistically. I think tolerance and mutual respect for
such rights may be the qualities we most need in order to get along
together on this planet.''

<HEAD>Atlanta-Area Lending Practices Reported Under Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A number of Atlanta banks and thrift institutions
said Tuesday they would cooperate with a Justice Department
investigation of possible racial discrimination in the area's
mortgage lending industry.
   ``I'm sure the Justice Department will find a good level of
cooperation among Atlanta's financial institutions,'' said Dallas
Lee, a spokesman for Citizens and Southern National Bank.
   The Washington Post reported Tuesday that the Justice Department
wants to see loan records covering the past five years as part of
an investigation of the 64 banks and savings and loan associations
in the metropolitan Atlanta area.
   The newspaper said the agency's Civil Rights Division, in
letters that began arriving Monday, gave the institutions official
notice that they are under civil investigation. The letters, signed
by Acting Assistant Attorney General James P. Turner, asked the
institutions to make the records available voluntarily, it said.
   Lee and others said the banks have taken significant steps in
the past year to do away with discrimination in mortgage lending.
   ``We are surprised that Atlanta was the city the Justice
Department picked for its investigation, considering all the
activities that have taken place in the last year,'' said Bo
Spalding, director of communications for Bank South. ``I wouldn't
be surprised if, after all of this, Atlanta has a rather exemplary
record of minority lending.''
   ``We don't feel we have discriminated overtly,'' said James J.
Wallace of Fulton Federal Savings Bank. ``I don't think there is a
single instance of outright discrimination by any of the larger
institutions.''
   The Post said the case is the broadest inquiry into so-called
redlining since the government settled a suit against the national
real estate appraisal associations in the late 1970s.
   Redlining, which is prohibited by federal law, is the refusal to
lend on the basis of race or other factors unrelated to credit
worthiness.
   The investigation was prompted by articles beginning last May in
The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution that disclosed a
segregated mortgage system in which banks and thrifts made few
loans in black areas _ even in upper-income black areas _ and often
made mortgage services less accessible to black home buyers.
   Atlanta's largest banks responded to the articles by pooling $77
million for low-interest mortgages primarily in black
neighborhoods. A few of the largest banks also changed some
policies, such as increasing contacts with black real estate
agents. Many smaller institutions reported no changes.
   The Justice inquiry, going beyond information available to the
newspaper, seeks records of actual loan applications and credit
reports on mortgage applicants, the Post said.

   An explosion Tuesday demolished a house,
critically injuring a woman inside, and damaged 11 other homes,
authorities said.
   The 3:26 a.m. blast was felt up to five miles away. It carried
debris half a block away from the demolished house and shattered
windows and cracked walls in neighboring homes.
   Norma McMahan, 64, of Fort Wayne, who was staying in the
one-story, frame house, was found in what was left of the garage,
although it was unclear where she was at the time of the explosion,
authorities said. Firefighters had to pry a section of the roof off
of her.
   Mrs. McMahan was in critical condition Tuesday evening in the
burn unit of Wishard Hospital in Indianapolis, where she was rushed
by helicopter. She suffered cuts and burns over most of her body.
   Firefighters extinguished two small fires at the demolished
home. One outside wall of the home was left standing.
   Authorities strongly suspected natural gas as the cause of the
explosion.

   Randy Travis was voted favorite
entertainer and Ricky Van Shelton won three country music honors
Tuesday night at the second annual Viewers' Choice Awards presented
by The Nashville Network cable channel.
   Travis, who has dominated country music awards for the past
three years, also won Best Album for ``Old 8 X 10.''
   Travis said he has not tired of winning awards for his
relatively short four-year professional career. ``You can always
find room for another one,'' he said.
   In voting by country music fans, Shelton won favorite male
vocalist, No. 1 video and favorite song, both for ``I'll Leave This
World Loving You.''
   Shelton, a former pipefitter, said he was especially pleased to
earn the vocalist honor.
   ``That's what I am,'' he said. ``I consider myself a singer; I
don't dance or do anything like that.''
   Reba McEntire outpolled rising star K. T. Oslin to earn favorite
female vocalist.
   ``This feels pretty dadblamed good,'' she said backstage
afterwards.
   The Oak Ridge Boys were voted favorite group for the second
straight year, and the quintet Shenandoah won favorite newcomer on
the basis of its No. 1 song, ``The Church on Cumberland Road.''
   Roy Acuff, 85, was presented a special award named after Grand
Ole Opry comrade Minnie Pearl to honor his lifelong humanitarian
endeavors.
   ``I hardly know what to say except it makes my heart feel
good,'' Acuff said after receiving a standing ovation from the
4,400 people watching the live broadcast at the Grand Ole Opry
House.
   Finalists for favorite entertainer besides Travis were Shelton,
the Judds, McEntire, George Strait and Hank Williams Jr.
   The awards were chosen by 200,000 viewers of The Nashville
Network, which is seen in 44.8 million households.
   Winners of eight categories were chosen by cable TV viewers who
cast their votes by telephone. The finalists were chosen by a
committee of journalists, broadcast industry representatives and
country music fans.
   The Nashville Network broadcast a live, 30-minute special after
the presentations with reactions from the winners at a post-show
party.
   More than 200 radio stations also carried the awards program.
   The inaugural 1988 awards drew 300,000 votes. Travis was the big
winner, sweeping all five categories in which he was nominated.
   The 6-year-old cable TV network broadcasts to more than 43
million cable TV households. Much of its programming is country
music along with sports shows and Western movies.
   It was the second country music awards show this month. The Los
Angeles-based Academy of Country Music announced its honors in an
NBC TV special April 10.

<HEAD>Bush Blends Various Themes as He Barnstorms California</HEAD>

   President Bush barnstormed California on
Tuesday, sending a message to drug dealers that ``you are going to
be out of business'' and asking the entertainment industry to raise
its voice against illegal narcotics.
   ``I never want to see a movie again that makes drug use into
something humorous,'' Bush said. ``It is time that they got behind
this crusade.''
   He also campaigned for smaller budget deficits and lower taxes
on capital gains.
   Bush blended a variety of sharply different themes in a
three-stop series of appearances in northern and southern
California on the second day of a busy four-day trip through six
states.
   The journey took him from a Ford Aerospace plant in Palo Alto to
a remote ranch in Orange County seized from an alleged drug kingpin
and finally to Los Angeles for an appearance before a Hispanic
audience.
   Opening the day, Bush started to say he was in North Carolina
but quickly caught himself and corrected it to north California.
   Later, Bush toured the 213-acre Rancho Del Rio, described by the
White House as once housing the largest marijuana network in the
United States. Now it is used by Orange County as a training
facility for drug enforcement officers.
   Bush did not propose any new federal initiatives but called on
the entertainment industry to use its influence as a tool against
drugs.
   He said entertainers ``have raised your voices so effectively in
the cause of so many issues. Can you not raise them once more, in
support of a cause so important?''
   He turned over to law enforcement officials $10 million
recovered from drug dealers.
   He called the money ``the bounty of defeated drug criminals''
and said ``let these funds go to fighting the war they once
financed. ...
   ``And let us send a message, loud and clear to every drug
merchant in America _ you are going to be out of business.''
   Bush said: ``We won't build a better America until we win the
war on drugs.'' He said drug users were living lives without hope
or meaning.
   ``We're looking at a desperation that money alone will never
cure. We won't win this one with our wallets alone _ we will win it
through our collective effort and our collective will.''
   In Los Angeles, Bush met with Republican Hispanic supporters. He
said Hispanics were building a better America ``through family,
church, love of country and belief in the value of hard work.''
   He said: ``As America's fastest-growing minority in the 21st
century, you, more than ever, will help tell the American story.''

   After the Hispanic reception in Los Angeles, Bush flew by
helicopter to Anaheim to watch a baseball game between the
California Angeles and the Baltimore Orioles. He was to remain in
Los Angeles overnight and meet Wednesday with former president
Ronald Reagan.
   At his first stop of the day, Bush said the best investment for
America's future would be to cut the huge federal budget deficit,
warning that ``tough talks still lie ahead'' to achieve that goal.
   He said the nation must be more competitive to sustain the
economic recovery that has produced nearly 20 million jobs over the
last seven years.
   Bush spoke to workers at Ford Aerospace's space systems division
in Palo Alto. The facility, which employs 2,000 people, produces
communications satellites, tactical weapons systems, space systems
and other high-tech products.
   After touring the aerospace facility, Bush told the audience
that ``the best investment in the future is to slash the federal
deficit. Every dollar the government does not borrow means more
capital available for investment.''
   He noted that he recently concluded a sketchy agreement with
Congress to cut the deficit to $99.4 billion in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1. The blueprint does not provide much detail about
how the reduction will be achieved.
   ``Now this plan's an agreed outline,'' Bush said. ``Tough talks
still lie ahead.''
   He said: ``Think of deficit reduction as an exercise, like
walking the dog every day. Believe me, I know, exercise keeps you
at the top of your game.''
   While challenging the nation to become more competitive in
technological innovation, Bush did not offer any new initiatives.
   He made a new pitch to reduce the capital gains tax rate to 15
percent from its current level of 28 percent. ``Lower capital gains
taxes will create jobs for those who don't have jobs and help build
a better America.''
   He laced his speech with television sound-bite lines such as ``I
want to give the high-five symbol to high tech. And I want to do it
by investing in competitiveness.''
   Ticking off some of his proposals, Bush noted he has proposed a
permanent extension of tax credits for research and
experimentation, and has asked Congress for an increase of $2.4
billion for NASA.
   ``Let us use our own technological prowess to expand free and
fair trade,'' Bush said. ``I'm talking about excellence in such
fields as microcomputers, superconductivity and, yes, aerospace.''
   Before an audience of white-collar workers, Bush also extolled
his proposal for a child-care tax credit for low-income parents.
   His plan would provide a credit of up to $1,000 for each child
under age 4 in poor families.
   ``Our proposal urges a nex tax credit to make child care more
affordable,'' Bush said. ``And it puts money in the hands of the
low-income parents, limits federal intervention and increases
options.
   ``A church can help or grandparents or professional nursery,''
he said. ``When it comes to child care, we say, let the parents
decide. Keep the family strong and we must do that.''

   At the drug store straddling the
Pennsylvania-Ohio line, the big money Tuesday moved to Carol
McGhee's lottery machine in Pennsylvania and ignored Debbie
Trinckes' machine in Ohio. The difference was a fortune.
   The Super 7 jackpot soared to $100 million in Pennsylvania and
its upper reaches were limited only by the deadline for the drawing
Wednesday night.
   Miss Trinckes sold a few tickets for the Ohio Lottery's Super
Lotto game, worth a mere $3 million. But even she crossed the line
to plunk down $20 for 20 tickets in Pennsylvania.
   ``I don't even play their lottery,'' she said, ``but since it's
so high, I decided to.''
   Lottery fever heightened not just in Pennsylvania but around the
country as state officials upped the ante in the Super 7 Lottery
drawing to at least $100 million based on ever-speeding ticket
sales from the Delaware River to the Penn-Ohio Drug store off U.S.
62.
   The jackpot is the result of six straight weekly drawings with
no winner and international publicity, which generated ticket sales
Monday of $19 million and a state record for daily sales of $24.34
million Tuesday. Last week's jackpot was $46 million.
   A single winner of the $100 million would receive almost $3.85
million a year for 26 years, lottery officials said.
   Pennsylvania's Super 7 game lets players choose seven numbers
from 1 to 80 for $1. If those seven are among 11 numbers selected,
the combination wins the jackpot, a chance lottery officials put at
9.6 million to 1.
   Out-of-state players drove to Pennsylvania, and many even flew
commercial flights into Pittsburgh and Philadelphia to get a chance
for the biggest-ever jackpot in North America.
   The line outside the two-state store, northeast of Youngstown,
Ohio, grew to 150 people at times, sometimes stretching all the way
across the state line, as patrons waited for the store's two
Pennsylvania lottery machines to crank out up 2,000 tickets per
hour together.
   Store Senior Vice President Bob Annis suggested to customers at
the end of the line that they may have more luck _ at least buying
tickets _ in nearby Mercer, about 20 miles into Pennsylvania.
   ``We want your business, but we're running at capacity. Come
back tomorrow,'' he said.
   Most Ohioans were not deterred.
   ``You can tell everybody that the winning ticket is going to
Cleveland,'' said James Casey, 36. ``I've been a police officer for
12 years and if I win, I'm going to retire.''
   Harry Brandt, 52, of Ravenna, Ohio, admitted he may be foolish
to take the longest of long shots, but said, ``What else are you
going to do, not play?''
   Miss McGhee, 40, of Sharon, said selling the tickets was not as
hectic as it appeared. She noted clerks get a chance to rest when
the machine prints tickets for large orders of 20 or more.
   She was able to rest Tuesday morning when one player ordered 200
tickets. And on Monday, one player bought 672 tickets. Co-workers
still talked about a man who put up $1,400 for tickets last
Thursday and gave them a 52-minute break.
   Miss McGhee said she only bought five tickets herself.
   Miss Trinckes, 31, of Hubbard, Ohio, complained of boredom
because she sold only 168 Ohio lottery tickets Tuesday morning.
``Normally, by this time, we would have sold 400 or 500.''

<TEXT>
   Radio messages recorded the morning the
Exxon Valdez hit a reef show the ship's captain spent up to an hour
trying to rock the tanker free, which could have sunk the ship and
spilled more oil, the Coast Guard said Tuesday.
   The captain ignored Coast Guard warnings that trying to move the
ship could have spilled the entire 1.2 million-barrel cargo, making
the nation's worst oil spill almost five times as bad, the
recordings show.
   But the Coast Guard commander who began monitoring the spill
shortly after it began said he did not fault the tanker skipper's
desperate efforts, and said he doubted they caused much more damage
than already had occurred.
   ``I think he probably used all his mariner's skills,'' after the
grounding, said Cmdr. Steve McCall. ``Obviously, before the
grounding, he didn't do all he could to prevent it, because it
happened.''
   The state revised the estimate of the oil spilled from the
tanker's punctured tanks to 11.2 million gallons. Officials said
its crews had been busy with the cleanup and were slow revising
Exxon's original estimate of 10.1 million gallons.
   Exxon said it has been hit with 31 lawsuits and 1,300 claims
ranging from $500 to $4 million in connection with the spill, and
expects more lawsuits as well as government fines. At a meeting of
securities analysts, top Exxon executives of the company said the
company already had paid $400,000 to settle smaller claims.
   Environmental damage from the oil still is being assessed, but
three hatcheries in oil-soaked Prince William Sound have begun
releasing millions of tiny salmon because the annual bloom of
plankton, an important food source for the fry, was at its peak.
   ``You can't stop Mother Nature,'' said Heather McCarty,
spokeswoman for the non-profit association that owns the three
hatcheries. By mid-May, 800 million salmon fry will be released
from five hatcheries throughout the sound.
   ``If we don't release them now or within the next few days
they'll miss the peak for plankton flowering. Then they won't
survive for sure,'' she said.
   Salmon fry tend to swim close to the surface of the water and
remain close to shorelines until they migrate to the open sea,
McCarty said.
   Exxon estimates at least 1 million gallons of oil still is
floating on the water of the sound and the Gulf of Alaska, and the
fry may encounter oil.
   Oil-skimming operations were hampered by a third straight day of
rough seas. Most vessels remained anchored in safe harbors, and
snow fell in Valdez.
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the consortium of oil companies
that operates the pipeline and marine terminal, announced it had
purchased three emergency response vessels and would use them
starting May 15 to help tugs escort tankers from Valdez through
Prince William Sound to the Gulf of Alaska.
   The Exxon Valdez was not guided by tugs when it ran aground
March 24.
   The recorded radio messages showed that McCall, in Valdez,
warned Capt. Joseph Hazelwood to take it ``slow and easy'' in
trying to get the ship off the reef that ripped his hull.
   ``Before you make any drastic attempt to get away, make sure you
don't, you know, start doing any ripping,'' McCall said. ``You got
a rising tide ... I wouldn't recommend doing much wiggling.''
   But Hazelwood already had begun trying to free the tanker.
   ``A little problem here with the third mate, but we're working
our way off the reef,'' Hazelwood said. ``We've, ah, the vessel has
been holed and we're ascertaining right now, we're trying to get
her off the reef and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.''
   The third mate was Gregory Cousins, whom Exxon says had been
given control of the ship as it maneuvered through Prince William
Sound on its way to the Gulf of Alaska and on to Long Beach, Calif.
Cousins, who was not certified to control the ship in the sound,
has been unavailable for comment.
   The reef was well outside the shipping lane through the sound.
   The first word of the accident came at 12:27 a.m. AST when
Hazelwood informed the Coast Guard in Valdez that he was aground,
``leaking some oil and we're going to be here for awhile.''
   The ship's logs indicate the ship ran aground 23 minutes earlier.
   Hazelwood is charged with operating the vessel while
intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of
pollution into the water, all misdemeanors.
   His attorney, Dick Madson said Hazelwood will return to Alaska
voluntarily, perhaps as early as next week and definitely before a
May 5 extradition hearing in New York.
   The radio tapes were obtained in a Freedom of Information Act
request filed by the Anchorage Daily News, which published details
of the conversations in a copyright story in its Tuesday editions.
   McCall said he doubted trying to free the ship exacerbated the
problem to any significant degree. The ship's hull had at least
eight holes, some up to 24 feet in diameter.
   Chief Petty Officer Dick Wehn said typically the risk of rocking
a stuck ship is that it may enlarge any holes in the bottom of the
boat.
   ``Knowing what we know now, I believe it would have gone down''
McCall said.
   Dan Lawn of the state Department of Environmental Conservation
said the tanker was shifting, creaking and groaning when he boarded
it about three hours after it ran aground.

   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama said Tuesday that
Japan's policy of coordinating economic and currency matters with
its Western partners will not change with the resignation of Prime
Minister Noburu Takeshita.
   ``It's not something that depends on one leader,'' Murayama told
reporters.
   Takeshita's announcement Tuesday that he would resign came at a
delicate time in Japan's international affairs. The announcement
was followed by official reassurances that foreign and economic
policies would remain steady.
   But the nation is expected to endure weeks of political
uncertainty as a successor is found, leaving Takeshita a lame-duck
leader.
   The prime minister said he would step down after parliament
passes the fiscal 1989 budget. But parliament is stalled by an
opposition boycott over the scandal enveloping the governing
Liberal Democrat Party and no legislative timetable exists for the
leadership transition.
   Washington will meanwhile be approaching crucial decisions on
how to deal with Japan's huge trade surplus. Other countries may
have to wait for word on Japanese aid and future moves on
increasing cooperation in the Pacific region.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with President
Bush in San Jose, Calif., said: ``Japan is a close ally and friend.
We will continue to work closely with the new prime minister and
government.''
   With a long holiday period called ``Golden Week'' starting
Saturday, a number of Cabinet members were scheduled to make trips
to the United States, the Soviet Union and other countries.
   America will decide next month whether to impose sanctions
against Japan under the new trade law because of the huge U.S.
deficit in trade with Japan, and several ministers were to leave
Sunday for talks in Washington to try to avoid penalties.
   Among them were Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, minister for international
trade and industry, and Agriculture Minister Tsutomu Hata.
   Mitsuzuka told reporters he expected to go ahead with his trip
unless prevented by parliamentary business. ``The passage of the
budget for the new fiscal year should be given top priority,'' he
said.
   Takeshita said he would go ahead with a nine-day trip to five
Southeast Asian countries starting Saturday ``because of the need
for consistency and continuity in Japan's foreign policy.''
   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno remained set to visit Moscow for
talks on a peace treaty and then go on to Mongolia. Japan and the
Soviet Union have yet to close the books on World War II.
   Analysts were divided on whether the widespread political
scandal that prompted Takeshita's resignation had an international
impact.
   Yozo Yokoda, professor of international law at International
Christian University, said bureaucrats here carry out policy, and
switching prime ministers would have little effect on the
government's ability to function.
   But he said foreign countries would be watching how Japan deals
with the scandal, in which the Recruit Co. conglomerate is
suspected of using bribes and dubious share transactions to buy
influence with politicians and bureaucrats.
   ``Scandals are common in any democracy,'' Yokoda said. ``What's
more important is how to overcome the scandal. It will show the
level of the country's democracy. If one dirty politician leaves
only to be replaced by another dirty one, the Japanese political
system will lose the trust of other countries.''
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus of the Philippines said in
Manila that Takeshita's talks there would center on Japan's role in
a multinational program to supply $10 billion in aid to the
Philippines.
   Malaysia's foreign minister, Abu Hassan Omar, said the
resignation ``is a shock, but we respect his position.'' He noted
that Takeshita launched a development fund to benefit the six
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and he hoped
such aid would continue.
   ASEAN members are Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia,
Brunei and the Philippines. Takeshita is to visit all except Brunei.
   President Suharto will receive Takeshita with full honors in
Indonesia, State Secretary Moerdiono said in Jakarta. He said
Suharto described the visit as an indication of the close
relationship between Japan and Indonesia. Japan's aid to Indonesia
is about $3 billion a year.
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo's scheduled May 24-27 visit
to Tokyo, already postponed from last November because of the fatal
illness of Emperor Hirohito, may be put off again, government
sources in Seoul said Tuesday.
   ``The Japanese situation may take a long time to calm down, so
it may be practically impossible for Mr. Roh to make a trip this
year,'' said a Foreign Ministry source there, speaking on condition
of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   A former Nicaraguan air force pilot
who vanished last week with a private plane has defected to
neighboring Costa Rica and is requesting asylum, a government
spokesman said Tuesday.
   The Interior Ministry spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, identified the pilot as Reinado Antonio Aranda Guido,
27. He said police were interrogating Aranda to determine if he
qualified for asylum.
   Aranda landed Friday in a single-engine Cessna-180 in Puerto
Limon, a town on the Caribbean coast, after he diverted it from a
domestic flight.
   In Managua, Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman David Silva
would not comment on the report of the defection. He said his
government was awaiting details from the Costa Rican government..
   Silva said Aranda had been a 2nd lieutenant in the Nicaraguan
air force but had returned to civilian life. He was working for
Special Air Services, a private Nicaraguan company, Silva said.
   Aranda was flying alone from Bluefields, the main port on the
Caribbean, to Corn Island, also in the Caribbean, when he
disappeared Friday. The plane belonged to Special Air Services.
   There was no immediate word on why Aranda would have fled
Nicaragua.

   A 16-year-old Vietnamese girl made deaf by a
nerve ailment realized a dream Tuesday when she got to see her
parents again before the disease takes her eyesight as well.
   Thao Phan, who last saw her parents nine years ago when her
father smuggled her aboard a boat heading for Thailand, hugged her
mother and father as they arrived in Houston on a flight from
Bangkok and London.
   Thao and other family members applauded and wiped away tears.
   ``I have never been so tired,'' Geri Konigsberg, the Houston
woman who helped reunite Thao with her family, said after making
the 24-hour flight with the girl's parents.
   Ms. Konigsberg, a spokeswoman for Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co.
who took an interest in Thao's plight two years ago after she was
contacted by school officials two years ago to see if the utility
could arrange for clothing donations for the girl.
   ``I asked her what else she wanted. And she said she wanted her
mother,'' said Ms. Konigsberg, who worked to grant Thao's wish.
   Thao journeyed to Thailand in the false bottom of a boat, then
spent two years in a refugee camp before coming to the United
States to live with a brother, one of two who arrived in Houston in
1980.
   Thao suffers from Usher's Syndrome, a congenital nerve disease
that took away her hearing and soon will leave her blind. She now
has a sight range of only 15 inches and has no peripheral vision.
   Ms. Konigsberg said Thao's father took the extreme measure with
his daughter because handicapped people in Vietnam are considered
worthless.
   ``He did it out of love,'' she said, saying he hoped U.S.
doctors could help.
   Thao should lead a healthy life, although she is deaf and her
loss of sight will eventually be complete, Ms. Konigsberg said.
   Thao speaks English in sign language. Her father, Lac Van Phan,
58, and mother, Mo Thi Nguyen, 55, speak only Vietnamese, as do a
sister, Hong, 17, and two brothers, Sohn, 10 and Ngoc, 7. They
lived in Vung Tau, a fishing and farming village about 60 miles
from Ho Chi Mihn City.
   ``It's the start of a new life for them,'' Ms. Konigsberg said.
``They're going to learn English now.''
   Thao, wearing a blue skirt and a blue and white striped shirt,
clutched a bouquet of roses and a red, white and blue Texas flag as
she embraced her mother when the woman came off the airliner.
   Ms. Konigsberg said the Phan family was terrified in London when
they boarded an elevator for the first time at Heathrow Airport,
but loved the in-flight movie, ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.''
   Ms. Konigsberg got U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas to use his
influence to trim the red tape in getting the family to the United
States, which has no diplomatic relations with Vietnam.
   During a visit to Hanoi last fall, Leland told Vietnamese
Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach about Thao's family and mentioned
the girl again when the foreign minister visited New York.
   In November, Leland's office was notified the Phan family would
be allowed to leave. British Airways agreed to pick up the costs of
bringing the family from Thailand to Houston.
   Despite her hearing disability, Thao has learned English through
sign language. She attends classes for the hearing impaired in the
Aldine School District, just north of Houston, said Onita Vaughan,
an educational diagnostician.

   President Bush announced plans Tuesday to
nominate William Lucas, a black critic of racial hiring quotas, to
become the Justice Department's civil rights chief despite
opposition from the NAACP.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, in a statement released by the
Justice Department, called Lucas ``a talented, decent and
compassionate person whom I have known for a number of years.''
   ``Bill Lucas is fully committed to the vigorous and fair
enforcement of our country's civil rights laws and to removing
barriers to equal opportunity for all our citizens,'' Thornburgh
said.
   Questioned by reporters as he accompanied Bush on a tour of a
seized drug ranch in Orange County, Calif., Thornburgh said that
``it's regrettable that this kind of fission has developed but the
president and I are both strongly'' in favor of the nomination.
   ``There is bipartisan support for his nomination generally. Most
of the senators we have talked to have agreed to withhold any
position until they have an opportunity to talk to Lucas and learn
what we have learned. He's a man well-qualified to be on the job,''
Thornburgh added.
   The White House said Bush would nominate Lucas, 61, a Detroit
lawyer, to be assistant attorney general for civil rights. Lucas, a
former Democrat, lost a race for governor of Michigan in 1986 after
he joined the Republican Party.
   While opponents of the choice appeared to be gearing up for what
could be a bruising fight for Senate confirmation, Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., a leading member of the Judiciary Committee, told
reporters in Boston that he would ``withhold judgment'' on Lucas
pending hearings.
   ``We'll have a chance to examine his record,'' Kennedy said,
noting reservations expressed by civil rights groups.
   Lucas has said he generally opposes racial hiring quotas but
once told an interviewer that there were ``some specific areas
where quotas are appropriate.''
   Lucas has said he disagreed with attempts by the Reagan
administration to overturn affirmative-action plans for the Detroit
police department and the Memphis, Tenn., fire department.
   Since Thornburgh recommended Lucas in February, Lucas has drawn
criticism from some civil rights leaders who question whether he is
qualified to be the government's chief civil rights enforcer.
   Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights, an umbrella coalition of 180 organizations, said his
group is concerned that Lucas lacks civil rights and legal
experience. The group's executive committee has not taken a
position on Lucas. Neas said it would meet shortly to discuss
whether to take one.
   ``William Lucas is a disappointing choice for the most important
civil rights job in the federal government, a job for which
expertise and experience are absolutely vital,'' said Arthur J.
Kropp, president of People for the American Way. ``Instead of a
strong civil rights advocate, Bush has chosen a man whose
qualifications and record are at best a question mark,'' he added
in a statement.
   People for the American Way, a well-financed liberal
organization, helped spearhead the 1987 fight to have the Senate
reject President Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork for the Supreme
Court.
   On Monday, the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group,
announced its opposition, saying ``we do not believe Mr. Lucas is
the person for this post.''
   But opposition to Lucas is not universal among black civil
rights leaders. The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, praised Lucas in a letter to
Thornburgh.
   Rep. John Conyers, a black Democrat from Detroit, reiterated his
support on Tuesday, saying a fight by civil rights groups to block
Senate confirmation ``would be a useless one, maybe even
counterproductive.''
   ``As far as I can see this is as good a nomination as we are
going to get,'' Conyers said, adding that, if Lucas is defeated,
Bush's next choice would also disappoint civil rights groups.
   ``My suspicions are that he won't pick anybody better and he
won't pick another African-American,'' Conyers said. ``We'll end up
regretting this hypercritical examination that some people choose
to indulge in with reference to Bill Lucas.''
   Opponents have pointed to Lucas' record as sheriff of Wayne
County, Mich., which includes Detroit, as evidence he lacks the
qualifications and sensitivity to run the civil rights division.
   They cite a 1976 court decision in which he was held in contempt
of court for failure to reduce overcrowding in the Wayne County
Jail. Lucas has contended his hands were tied by the refusal of
local authorities to appropriate more money but the court also
cited him for failure to improve conditions it said were within his
control.
   In 1985, a federal appellate court, in a case involving
allegations a prisoner was severely beaten while in custody,
criticized Lucas, saying he failed to implement training procedures
that would have prevented the incident.
   Lucas, who also served as Wayne County executive, has been
criticized for listing himself as an assistant U.S. attorney in the
Justice Department on resumes he prepared in the 1970s.
   Lucas served as a researcher in the Justice Department's civil
rights division in the early 1960s but resigned in 1963 after he
failed to pass the District of Columbia bar examination.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson sounded a conciliatory note.
   After an appearance Tuesday night at Harvard's John F. Kennedy
School of Government, Jackson said, ``We would be better served by
meeting with him than confronting him.''
   ``I hope he serves well,'' said Jackson, who said a major
challenge for Lucas would be interpreting the so-called ``Richmond
decision'' by the U.S. Supreme Court in January that struck down
the city's minority contract quota system.
   Jackson urged Lucas not to attempt to broaden the applications
of the decision to other cities.
   While Jackson said he would oppose an all-out Senate
confirmation fight, he said the Senate should judge Lucas ``by an
objective set of criteria,'' and if he fails the test, he should be
rejected.

<TEXT>
   An aide to Noboru Takeshita killed himself
Wednesday after the prime minister announced he would resign partly
because of financial dealings handled by the aide, police said.
   Japan Broadcasting Corp. said Ihei Aoki committed suicide by
slashing his wrists with a razor and hanging himself at his home in
Tokyo on Wednesday morning. The network quoted police and fire
officials as saying an ambulance crew, responding to an emergency
call, found him dead.
   Officials at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police headquarters
confirmed that Aoki, 58, had slashed his wrists.
   Aoki had handled political donations, stock purchases and loans
from the Recruit Co., which is at the hub of the bribery scandal
that toppled Takeshita. There was no immediate comment on the
suicide from Takeshita, whom Aoki had served as aide for three
decades.
   Two days before Takeshita announced his resignation, news
reports surfaced that Aoki had accepted a loan from the Recruit Co.
of $384,000 in 1987 for use in Takeshita's campaign to succeed
Yasuhiro Nakasone as prime minister. The money was later paid back.
   The revelation embarrassed Takeshita because he had not included
it in a report to Parliament on April 11, when he acknowledged
receiving more than $1 million in legal political donations from
Recruit, an information conglomerate.
   Takeshita did not blame Aoki in his resignation statement, but
news reports Monday said he had not known of the loan when he spoke
to Parliament. The reports said the aide had not informed him of it
until Saturday.
   Recruit is accused of seeking influence and favors by selling
shares in a subsidiary at bargain prices to politicians,
bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives.
   Takeshita, through Aoki and a relative, received some of those
shares, which skyrocketed in value after they went on public sale
in late 1986. Aoki bought 2,000 shares, which yielded a profit of
about $30,000.
   The scandal has forced the resignations of three Cabinet
ministers in addition to Takeshita and led to the arrests of 14
businessmen and bureaucrats.

   Lawmakers are reacting cautiously to Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney's plan to scale back spending on Star Wars
and delay work on the B-2 stealth bomber to meet the $299.2 billion
Pentagon budget for fiscal 1990.
   The proposed cuts, as well as President Bush's decision to
develop both the MX and Midgetman land-based, nuclear missiles,
drew a mixed reaction Monday from congressional Democrats and
Republicans alike.
   ``Further development of the Midgetman wastes funds that are
sorely needed for other defense programs,'' Sen. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said of
the compromise decision.
   But Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on the
House Armed Services Committee, said he had no problem with the
plan. ``The main thing is to preserve and protect the assets we've
got, which is MX in silos, and then go forward and make them
mobile.''

   Linked to a spreading influence-peddling scandal
and immensely unpopular, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita announced
his resignation today but left the timing of his departure and the
succession unclear.
   The Recruit scandal, which has bedeviled Japanese politics for
half of Takeshita's 18-month tenure, leaves Japan in a state of
political uncertainty and it appeared possible that an elder
politician might become a sort of interim prime minister until the
situation is sorted out.
   The candidate mentioned in many news reports today was former
Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ito, whose health was in question _ he
is a diabetic.
   ``I think it should be a young person. It's time for a young
person to be in charge,'' said Ito, 75, who chairs the executive
council of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.

   Millions of tiny salmon have been released
into oil-tainted Prince William Sound, and wildlife officials were
deploying fireworks, shotguns and other noisemakers to scare
migrating birds to safety.
   With high winds and rough seas hampering the cleanup Monday for
the second straight day, the focus was on wildlife as the state
announced Exxon had agreed to build a second otter rehabilitation
center.
   The troop ship USS Juneau, meanwhile, arrived from San Diego to
become a floating mobile base for up to 400 cleanup workers who
will go out in small boats.
   The weather, with seas up to 18 feet, kept oil-skimming boats
hugging the shore in the sound and the Gulf of Alaska. But a
fishermen's flotilla attacked encroaching oil off the southern tip
of Kenai Peninsula near the mouth of Cook Inlet. The boats dragged
nets, with absorbent material sewn into them, the way they would
gather herring this time of year.

   The NAACP is setting the stage for a
potentially bruising Senate confirmation fight by opposing Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh's choice to head the Justice Department's
civil rights division.
   The opposition of the nation's foremost civil rights group could
energize liberal opposition to William Lucas, a black Republican
who opposes racial quotas and is a critic of affirmative action.
   Benjamim Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, said in a statement Monday
that Lucas is not qualified to be the government's chief enforcer
of civil rights laws.
   His declaration of the NAACP position came with the White House

   After more than two decades behind bars for
the fatal poisoning of his seven children, new evidence suggests
James Richardson didn't do it. Today, he headed to court hoping a
judge will set him free.
   For months, the once-hearty fruit picker who is now a graying
53-year-old man has been inching toward freedom with evidence
suggesting he did not poison his children to collect on a life
insurance policy.
   The state Supreme Court in March appointed retired Circuit Judge
Clifton Kelly to hear the appeal. Earlier this month, special
prosecutor Janet Reno said the 1968 conviction should be overturned
because evidence was withheld and witnesses lied under oath with
the prosecutor's knowledge.
   Kelly has said he would like to make a decision today. If the
ruling were to go in Richardson's favor, he could be released from
prison immediately.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three years after James Garner and James Wood
starred in an award-winning television special about schizophrenia,
the actors have reunited for a production that can best be
described as sobering.
   ``My Name Is Bill W.,'' which airs Sunday on ABC-TV, tells the
story of Bill Wilson, the late co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous.
   ``This is a very unsentimental version of Bill Wilson's life,''
said Woods, 42, who plays Wilson. ``There are scenes in this
picture that I think are literally hair-raising. There was no
sentimental restraint placed on us.
   ``They allowed us to show the true story ... and it's a
devastating story and it's not an easy story to watch,'' he added.
   The story focuses on the struggles of a stockbroker whose health
and success are destroyed by twin calamities _ the stock market
crash of 1929 and his own alcoholism.
   It details the days when Wilson was unable to stop drinking
despite the efforts of a devoted wife, Lois (played by JoBeth
Williams). Strapped to a hospital bed, he realizes he is helpless
to defeat alcoholism alone.
   Most of the two-hour movie shows the horrors Wilson faced before
he met Dr. Bob Smith, an Akron, Ohio, surgeon and drunk played by
Garner.
   A church arranged for the two men to meet after Wilson, only
sober for a short time and struggling to rebuild his life, arrived
in Akron. He was lonely, uptight and tempted by other drinkers.
   Smith, thinking Wilson came to lecture him to stop drinking, was
suspicious.
   ``Just what do you think a man like you can do for me?'' Smith
asks.
   Wilson cries out: ``I didn't come here to help you. I came here
to help me.''
   Garner calls Wilson and Smith ``two of the greatest men of this
century, two drunks who got together to help each other and ended
up helping millions of others.''
   Filmed in Richmond, Va., the Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation
was written by William Borchert, who read his script to the
97-year-old Mrs. Wilson on the back porch of her Bedford Hills,
N.Y., home last fall.
   ``When I got finished she reached for my hand, put her arms
around me and we shed tears together. She said, `I'm very happy
this story will finally be told to the world.' Twenty one days
later she passed away,'' he said.
   The production was the idea of Peter Duchow, co-producer with
Garner.
   Duchow met Wilson in the 1950s and was convinced by 1953 the
story should be told. But he could not pursue it for 30 years.
   Garner and Duchow discussed the project in 1983 but five scripts
were rejected.
   ``Because there is a tendency to beatify Bill Wilson, most
writers really are influenced by the size of the membership and
what all of that means,'' he said. ``Our feeling was always let's
personalize by simply telling the story of Bill Wilson, which was
very difficult to get on paper.''
   Garner and Woods had worked together more than once. As a
fledgling actor, Woods played the villain in the first episode of
Garner's ``The Rockford Files.''
   And in ``Promise,'' another Hallmark special broadcast in 1986,
Garner played a carefree man forced to care for his schizophrenic
brother, played by Woods, after the death of their mother. It lost
in the ratings to a Dolly Parton television movie, but won five
Emmy awards.
   Woods recalled hearing Duchow and Garner ``mumbling about their
next project'' in a coffee shop at the end of filming for
``Promise.''
   ``I kind of cocked an ear and thought there could be a job in
this. I said, `Heh. I'm Bill W. I could be Bill W.' I didn't quite
realize what I was about to embark on,'' he said.
   ``I have friends and people I love very dearly who in the course
of work are alcoholics. Most of them have found Alcoholics
Anonymous and a few have not and some are dead,'' he said. ``I just
hope the few who aren't members will find their way in.''
   Even before the production aired, it had an impact. After Garner
and Woods appeared on television talk shows to promote the movie,
Woods was stopped by a woman outside his hotel in New York; she
said the actors had convinced her brother to join AA.
   A day earlier, Woods had told a luncheon gathering, ``If we can
save one life, then we will go greatly beyond what we hoped to do,
which was great entertainment, some information. If there's a life
or two along the way that we can save, then we will indeed be
blessed.''

   When 9-year-old Lydia Fulton misplaced her
bicycle last year, she found a quick alternative for covering her
paper route. She hopped on her pet pony.
   Lydia, a fourth grader with seven older brothers, has had an
afternoon paper route since December.
   Except when it's snowing or raining, she and her Shetland pony,
Jacky, take to the streets of Hingham to deliver The Patriot Ledger
newspaper, published in Quincy.
   Her mother calls Jacky a ``fair weather pony'' because she's
older now and the family fears for her health in poor weather.
   Lydia says she's been riding horses since the age of 4, and as
for using Jacky on her paper route, ``It's fun.''
   It's more to her liking than growing up in a houseful of boys,
which, she says, is ``kind of boring.''

<HEAD>Corporate Dividends Are Rising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whatever IBM does, it's bound to attract
attention and provoke discussion, and maybe even spur others to do
the same. Investors who depend on dividends are hoping so.
   IBM raised its common stock dividend this week for the first
time in 4{ years. The 11-cent increase to $1.21 a share raises the
annual yield to 4.2 percent from 3.9 percent and enriches
shareholders by $250 million a year.
   Will others follow? Perhaps. But in this instance IBM isn't so
much a leader as a follower. Without the excitement that often
attends increases in share prices, corporate dividends have been
moving higher for the past year.
   In fact, Commerce Department and independent analysts' data show
it has been many months, even years, since such increases have been
seen. There are suggestions that improvements will continue through
the year.
   Wright Investors' Service, which analyzes stock performance,
notes that for the 12 months through March dividends for the
Standard &amp; Poors 500 stock index rose 11.5 percent.
   First-quarter action in the current year also was strong,
according to Wright, with 521 companies raising dividends and 116
paying extras, ``the highest total of favorable dividend actions of
any first quarter since 1982.''
   If you use the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks as a
measuring stick, the dividend news is even more impressive _ 26
percent for the first quarter, 17 percent for the past 12 months _
until you know the reason why.
   Wright points out that these growth rates were inflated by two
unusual actions, one being a $1.12 a share extra dividend by Alcoa,
the other a 75 cents a share dividend paid by Texaco, which was
undergoing bankruptcy court reorganization a year earlier.
   Commerce Department data verify the improved performance,
indicating that recent dividend growth has been in the range of 10
percent to 12 percent. All in all, the activity has been the best
since 1979-1980, but with a difference.
   That difference is a big one. In the earlier period the
inflation rate was close to 10 percent and dividend growth was
merely keeping pace. Inflation is lower today. Real dividend growth
is more than 5 percent, highest in 12 years.
   Despite the sharp increases, the growth of dividends over the
past year has trailed corporate profit growth, and dividend yields
_ the payout compared to earnings _ remain well below the long-term
norms.
   Wright points out, for instance, that the 11 percent dividend
increase for the S&amp;P 500 in the past 12 months compares with a
profit rise of more than 30 percent. The increases, it states,
result in a dividend payout rate of 41 percent of profits, compared
with 50 percent for the post-World War II period.
   Wright's explanation: ``The current low payout rate is in large
part cyclical. Dividend growth normally lags in periods of strong
profit recovery, with payout catching up as profit growth slows.''
   While this would suggest futher dividend increases to come,
Wright is a bit cautious, limiting itself to forecasting ``a
reasonably good pace through 1989.''
   For this cycle, it explains, the rate of dividend payouts may
improve more slowly than normal, because funds that corporations
normally set aside for dividends may be siphoned into stock
repurchase programs.

<TEXT>
   ``Amritsar is now a boom town,'' said
Sanjay Galhotra, a Hindu who owns a hotel and plans to build a
four-story shopping center. ``Last year I would have been called a
fool.''
   Long the center of the bloody, 7-year-old separatist war by Sikh
radicals, Amritsar has come alive since Indian government forces a
year ago dislodged Sikh militants from the Golden Temple, holiest
shrine of the Sikh faith.
   But the terror that gripped the city has moved to villages and
wheat fields of the countryside of Punjab state, torn by the
militant uprising since 1982.
   ``People don't care for the militants any more,'' said Amarjit
Walia, the owner of an Amritsar television and appliance shop where
business has increased. ``Spirits are high in Amritsar.''
   The most visible change over the past year is at the Golden
Temple, which gets its name from the gold plating on its walls.
Hundreds of pilgrims throng the marble walkway around the shrine,
earlier inhabited by rifle-toting militants who had turned it into
a fortress.
   Sikh devotees in orange and blue turbans are accompanied by
wives and children. A Hindu visiting the temple is no longer deemed
foolhardy.
   The change came after security forces laid siege to the temple
last May. More than 40 people were killed, and in the course of the
10-day siege nearly 200 militants, including many of the separatist
movement's leaders, surrendered and were arrested.
   Police say the clearing of the temple left remaining militants
leaderless and without a base of operations. Armed policemen remain
on guard outside the temple, searching visitors for weapons,
however.
   But the Sikh militants' war for independence from India
continues in the fields just outside Amritsar.
   ``There is terror in the countryside, terror and threats'' said
Mukhtiar Singh, a doctor in the village of Jagdev Kalan, a
mud-and-brick hamlet 14 miles north of Amritsar. ``The government
is not doing anything for our protection.
   ``The Hindus had left earlier. Now, Sikhs are joining them to
find safety in big towns.''
   About 8,000 people, all Sikhs, live in Jagdev Kalan. Most till
the wheat fields surrounding the village. Some work at the local
school and grocery shops.
   Mukhtiar Singh said the 200 Hindus in the village moved to
Amritsar after an attack by Sikh militants in August, 1987, left at
least 12 Hindus and Sikhs dead.
   Now the militants now turn their guns on fellow Sikhs, accusing
them of being police informers or failing to show enough enthusiasm
for their movement to separate from India and what they perceive as
Hindu domination. Sikhs make up 55 percent of Punjab's 20 million
population but only 2 percent of India's 880 million people.
   At least 15 Sikh families have left Jagdev Kalan this year,
Mukhtiar Singh said.
   ``The village is not safe,'' said Harbhajan Singh, the village's
headman. ``No one moves out at night, only the police. And if there
is a gunshot, all lights in the village go out.''
   Mukhtiar Singh said wealthy Sikhs are fast becoming the main
source of money for the militants. A demand for money is followed
by a visit and then an attack on those who do not comply, he said.
   As ordained by their faith, all Sikh men use the name Singh,
which means lion in the Punjabi language.
   ``Militant activity has shifted from fundamentalism to petty
crime,'' said C. Pal Singh, police inspector-general in Amritsar.
``There is no leadership, so the militants cannot get organized.
They hit soft targets if they can.''
   More than 550 people have been killed in Punjab this year. At
least 2,400 people were killed in the state in 1988.
   Sarabjeet Singh, the top administrator of Amritsar district,
said that in the last three months, in the Amritsar district alone,
more than 500 villagers had left their homes for the relative
safety of places like Amritsar, where once-deserted restraurants
nowadays are crowded until midnight.

<HEAD>People Rate Religion News Important But Lean To Reading Sports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans think it's more important for
newspapers to cover religion than sports, a new national study
finds. But people are a bit more likely to read sports stories.
   Indications also turned up that increasing religious coverage
likely won't do much to boost circulation, since
religion-interested readers already make up the bulk of readership.
   ``The religious and religion-interested readers are already
there,'' says the project director, Steward M. Hoover of Temple
University in Philadelphia. ``Religiosity and newspaper readership
are statistically associated.''
   Preliminary findings of the study, described as the first
comprehensive research on press coverage of religion and interest
in it, were presented recently to the Religious Public Relations
Council convention in Washington.
   Concerning the relative news importance of nine special fields,
religion was found to rank about in the middle, below education,
health and business, but above sports, food, personal advice,
entertainment and art.
   When people were asked to rate their likelihood of actually
reading about the topics, religion also ranked in the middle, but
below sports. Ahead of sports again were health, education and
business.
   The study, sponsored by Religious News Service under a grant
from the Lilly Endowment, included two national Gallup polls of
1,100 samples each, plus in-depth interviews in a variety of local
congregations.
   Contrary to assumptions that people are primarily interested in
local religion stories, ``we discovered great expressions of
interest in national and international religion stories,'' said
Judy Weidman, RNS editor-director.
   In ranking the importance of types of religion news, the polls
gave first place to ``social and ethical positions and
pronouncements by major faith groups,'' such as on abortion,
nuclear policy and the economy.
   While ``local church news and announcements'' ranked second, all
the other highly-rated categories ``were national and international
in scope, rather than locally or individualistically oriented,''
Hoover said.
   These included, in this order, ``ethical and social issues,''
the ``role of religion in foreign or international politics,'' the
``role of religion in American politics,'' and ``national religious
issues and controversies.''
   Hoover said the findings undermined ``tried-and true
assumptions'' that readers want ``stories of faith and
inspiration'' or opinion commentary about religion. These rated low
in appeal.
   ``The findings confirmed what we have been hearing in our
local-congregational interviews,'' Hoover said. ``People think of
religion in national and even global terms. They know it is a
dimension of other news. They clearly want that dimension to be
covered well.''
   Seventy-one percent of those polled called themselves ``daily
readers'' and 81 percent said religion is important in their lives.
Of these considering religion important, a higher proportion _ 80
percent are daily readers.
   More than half of the total sample _ 52.2 percent _ said it was
important for newspapers to cover religion as well as other kinds
of news.
   Asked how well the press covers the various specialties, sports
got the most ``excellent'' scores, followed by business, food and
entertainment. But a rather poor job is seen in religious coverage.
It ranked seventh.
   ``The sad truth is that many of this country's almost 1,700
daily newspapers either ignore the religion story or amuptate it at
the county line,'' Ms. Weidman said.
   A still incomplete part of the study involves interviews with
eight newspapers regarded as covering religion well. Three already
have been visited, the Los Angeles Times, The Tennessean in
Nashville and St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times.
   ``What these newspaper executive believe in common is that the
religion story is central to interpreting life in their communities
and American culture in general,'' Ms. Weidman said.
   Debunking an old claim that a news professional needs to be
religious to give a fair shake to religion, she quotes Teresa
Wasson, city editor of the Tennessean as saying:
   ``I'm an atheist myself, but I have great respect for religion
as a motivational force in people's lives...Religion is simply not
important to many reporters or editors personally, and thus they
don't understand how personally important it is to readers...
   ``I think they don't understand the richness of coverage
available in religion. It's not just socials and churchy things.
Religion is very rich turf in news value, and many editors don't
know that.''

   ``If I needed shoes and South Africa
was the only place I could get shoes, I would do without them,''
former President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania once said. ``But if I
needed corn and South Africa was the only place to get corn, I
would go to South Africa.''
   Millions of people in southern Africa are both barefoot and
hungry these days, and though their leaders are reluctant to admit
it, they depend on South Africa for commerce so conditions won't
get any worse than they are.
   From war-ravaged Angola and Mozambique to tiny, overcrowded
Malawi, the region includes some of the poorest and least developed
nations in the world.
   Almost a decade after nine black-ruled states joined forces in
an ambitious effort to lessen their reliance on South Africa, they
have yet to tap their economic potential and still are inextricably
linked to their southern neighbor.
   ``In many ways the countries are worse off now than in 1980,''
said Tom Kennedy, a South African-based researcher who recently did
a study on economic conditions in southern Africa. ``Due to wars,
bad internal policies and poor management, there's been very little
progress in the region.''
   The nine regional states are Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe,
Zambia, Tanzania, Malawi, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, which
make up the Southern African Development Coordination Council
(SADCC).
   SADCC concentrates on the region's two most pressing problems,
transportation routes and food supplies. Since it was founded in
1980, the organization has helped increase trade among member
states, improved the flow of technology and research, and currently
is involved in almost 600 projects that will cost some $7 billion.
   But successes have been limited. Almost three-quarters of the 75
million people in SADCC countries remain subsistance farmers and
per capita income in the region is less than $500 a year, according
to World Bank figures.
   South Africa remains the leading trading partner for seven of
the nine SADCC countries. Its roads, rails, ports, power stations
and communications networks are essential to their economic
survival.
   South Africa's 28 million blacks have higher average incomes
than in any SADCC country. More than a million workers from
neighboring countries earn their livings in South Africa, while the
traffic in the opposite direction is minimal.
   The black-led countries want to reduce reliance on South Africa
not only because they oppose its apartheid policies, but also to
take advantage of potentially more efficient trade routes.
   Malawi, where annual per capita income is about $200, spends an
extra $100 million a year exporting its tobacco, tea and nuts
through distant South Africa because railway lines in neighboring
Mozambique are mostly inoperative because of guerrilla sabotage,
according to Kennedy's estimates.
   Zaire, more than 600 miles north of South Africa, receives more
than half its imports via South Africa although it has its own
Atlantic Ocean port.
   Five major railways connect landlocked nations of southern
Africa to the Indian and Atlantic Oceans.
   However, four pass through Angola or Mozambique, where civil
wars dating to the mid-1970s have halted or sharply reduced traffic.
   ``The region will never have secure food supplies until we can
make these rail lines work,'' said Nkwaki Ng'wanakilala, a
spokesman at SADCC's headquarters in Gaborone. ``And that won't be
possible until the fighting stops.''
   The region's fifth rail line, which links Zambia to the port of
Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, has been unaffected by war. But poor
management has kept it from operating anywhere near full capacity
since it was built by the Chinese in the 1970s. About half its 75
locomotives are out of service.
   Farm-to-market roads throughout southern Africa range from
primitive to non-existent. Crops in the fertile region often rot in
the fields.
   The region has the potential to feed much of the continent, but
farmland is often under utilized. Farmers are almost exclusively
small-scale growers with little training, equipment or access to
government services.
   Zimbabwe is the only SADCC country that has more than 100
private commercial farms of several hundred acres or more,
according to regional agricultural officials.
   The Southern African Economist, a magazine published by SADCC,
noted that regional governments ``blame the decline in food
production on a host of factors ranging from adverse weather,
escalating costs of fertilizers and longer transport routes to
disruption of agriculture by South African-backed terrorists.''
   But, it added, the ``blame also lies with the governments
themselves, for maintaining subsidies and setting unrealistic
producer prices which give farmers no incentive to produce more.''
   Despite the gloomy picture, there have been two recent
developments that could strengthen southern African economies in
the long-term.
   South Africa has been trying to improve relations with black
Africa and expressed eagerness to cooperate on development
projects. It has agreed to grant independence to Namibia and says
it has stopped supporting guerrilla movements in Angola and
Mozambique.
   SADCC has estimated that South African military actions in the
region have cost more than $10 billion during the 1980s.
   The more peaceful climate has eased the international pressure
for sanctions against South Africa, which inevitably would damage
its neighbors as well.
   Also, several countries have begun to pursue market-oriented
economies and are moving away from ``African socialism'' and
centralized economies.
   Tanzania, long hostile to free enterprise, has been implementing
austerity measures backed by the International Monetary Fund since
President Ali Hassan Mwinyi came to power in 1985.
   ``IMF conditionalities are painful,'' Mwinyi said last year.
``But we have to make a choice between two sharp-pointed spears. It
is either we go forward with shops full of expensive commodities or
we revert to the days of empty shops.''
   Malawi has pursued similar reforms, while Mozambique and
Zimbabwe, both officially socialist, are talking less about
ideology and offering some encouragement to foreign investors.
   At present, SADCC's only economic standout is the arid nation of
Botswana, where diamond wealth has transformed the country from one
of the poorest in the world into one of Africa's wealthiest states
in 22 years of independence.
   The economy has been growing at roughly 10 percent a year
throughout the 1980s and Botswana has foreign reserves of $2.3
billion, equal to South Africa's.
   The government's formula has been a commitment to free
enterprise, support for foreign investors and a fiscal policy that
is probably the most conservative in Africa. Officials warned of
spending curbs this year when the projected budget surplus dipped
below $200 million.

   When Zambia gained independence from
Britain in 1964, it had thriving copper mines, abundant farmland
and a degree of prosperity that made it the envy of its neighbors.
   Today more than 1 million Zambians are threatened by famine, the
government can't pay its bills, and acute shortages of many
supplies keep even successful businesses operating at sharply
reduced capacities.
   Zambia's economy has been in a downward spiral since the
mid-1970s, and Western economists say its ills have been largely
self-induced through bad policies and poor management.
   Living standards have declined every year during the 1980s, and
per capita income was $361 in 1988, only marginally higher than
when the British left, according to government statistics.
   Inflation is at least 50 percent, unemployment is high and
Zambia's foreign debt of $5.5 billion is about twice its annual
gross domestic product.
   ``The government knows it has a serious problem, but it
continues to create obstacles and display a hostile attitude toward
many businessess, especially small entrepreneurs,'' said a
Zambia-based Western economist who requested anonymity.
   Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's president since independence, is a
harsh critic of Western capitalism, but in 1985 he began an
economic restructuring plan sponsored by the International Monetary
Fund.
   Kaunda slashed subsidies for a number of consumer goods,
including corn meal, which many Zambians eat three times a day.
Thousands of people rioted in December, 1986, leaving 15 dead.
Kaunda responded by breaking relations with the IMF, leaving the
landlocked nation of 7.5 million even more desperate for foreign
assistance.
   The government has fixed prices for more than two years on such
basic goods as corn meal, sugar, cooking oil and charcoal. The
result has been widespread shortages and a bustling black market.
   Every morning women line up outside supermarkets in Lusaka, then
buy up scarce items within 30 minutes after the doors open. Some
buy more than they need and sell the extra on street corners at
double what they paid.
   Zambia is the world's fifth largest copper producer and last
year prices were near an all-time high. But production problems and
a lack of skilled workers and managers limited output to just over
400,000 tons, well short of the goal of 500,000 tons and nowhere
near the 720,000 tons gathered in 1969.
   The country also had a record corn crop in 1988, but a large
portion rotted due to poor transportation. Truck drivers often
refuse to travel on unpaved rural roads because spare parts are
scarce.
   Chico, a cab driver in Lusaka, gave an example of what it's like.
   ``If I need a spare tire I have a big problem,'' he said.

   Teeming shantytowns sprawl across the hills
surrounding Caracas in Venezuela and more and more, as economic
conditions worsen, they are becoming breeding grounds for social
unrest. An Associated Press correspondent visited one recently and
filed this report, one of a series on the economic, social and
political turbulence that has turned South America into a continent
in crisis.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maria Zurbaran Ruiz, her commom-law
husband and their eight children live in a tin-roofed, three-room
shack called a rancho on the slope of a hill overlooking Caracas.
They consider themselves fortunate.
   He has a job making bricks 10 to 12 hours a day 100 miles away
in Valencia for roughly the equivalent of $25 a week.
   The good life for her is being able to feed her the children
corn bread and coffee, sometimes with milk, for breakfast; black
beans and spaghetti for lunch and again for dinner; and meat on
Saturdays, when her husband, Luis Antonio Zambrano, is home.
   But Maria Zurbaran Ruiz, who is 48 years old, said things won't
be that way much longer.
   She was talking about the recent turn of events in Venezuela _
price increases that set off rioting down on the streets of Caracas
Feb. 27-March 2, leaving 276 people dead and about 1,000 injured.
   ``There are several bad years ahead,'' she said. ``Nothing will
be easy anymore.''
   Some of those who went down into the streets to protest, loot
and burn were from Maria's slum, Rancholandia.
   It is the kind of place in South America where riots, and
sometimes revolutions, are born.
   Maria said she tells her children to prepare themselves for hard
times. She has 14 in all _ 7 to 33 years old _ but just eight still
live with her.
   ``I was blessed with 20 children,'' she said, ``but my triplets
and another three died in the 60s from disentery.''
   Millions like Maria and her family live in ranchos on the hills
around Venezuelan cities.
   Maria and Luis Antonio aren't as poor as most of them nor as
better off as some of them.
   She stays at home while he goes off to work Mondays through
Thursdays in Valencia. Before leaving Valencia for home on
weekends, he stops at a slaughterhouse and with part of his pay
buys a kilo of meat _ 2.2 pounds.
   ``With Luis Antonio at home for the weekend, Saturday is the
feast day,'' Maria said. ``Everyone gets a piece of meat mixed with
a lot of boiled potatos so that everybody is full for the rest of
the day. Maybe it won't be every Saturday anymore.''
   She was thinking again about the price increases and the riots.
   The price increases were part of a government austerity program
intended to halt the downward economic spiral Venezuela has been in
since the collapse of oil prices a few years ago.
   The program called for the lifting of subsidies that kept prices
low for the poor. At the same time, the bolivar, the local
currency, was allowed to float for the first time in decades and
prices for unsubsidized goods and services also rose.
   The government of President Carlos Andres Perez said it had no
alternative, but it did not expect people to pour out of the
ranchos as they did.
   They came by the thousands. In Caracas, at least 50 percent of
the population of 4 million lives in ranchos.
   Sociologists and politicians analyzed the sudden swarm of
protest as the revenge of the have-nots against the rich.
   Maria said she had no part of it.
   ``Here we are all honest people. The `malandros' (criminals)
came from up the hill,'' she said, gesturing with her left thumb.
   There wasn't much hill left before the top and it was hard to
determine where the ``malandros'' could have come from.
   All that can be seen from Maria's rancho are myriads of other
ranchos crammed over the hills like a waving ocean of corrugated
metal.
   Full employment is rare in the ranchos; many people are
completely jobless, others are underemployed and still others make
a living as street vendors.
   Maria considers herself lucky because Luis Antonio has the
brick-making job in Valencia, where he stays with his mother during
the work week to save bus fare back and forth every day.
   Maria adds about 400 bolivars ($13) to the weekly budget by
sewing pants on a neighbor's machine and sweeping a nearby school
twice a week.
   But electricity is free in Rancholandia _ people simply hook
into the power lines _ and water comes from a public line not far
from Maria's rancho.
   Ranchos began sprouting in Venezuelan cities only during the
last 30 years, while the nation was establishing itself one of the
most stable democracies in Latin America.
   Before that, the dictatorial governments that ruled most of the
time since independence from Spain in 1811 barred the poor from
building shacks in the cities.
   They were kept in rural areas and the few who made it into
Caracas were constantly harassed by authorities.
   But after the dictatorship of Marco Perez Jimenez collapsed in
1958, the poor were allowed in from the countryside and as the
nation's oil economy burgeoned they flocked to the cities for jobs.
   Caracas and other cities soon were overwhelmed by a new socialwing
decade when Venezuela began to swell with oil money
the couple built a sturdier one of adobe and concrete blocks a bit
further down the hill.
   ``Now we do have space,'' she said pointing to the narrow,
partly walled space where she cooks and does the laundry. At
midday, it is the only cool place in her rancho. Heat in the rest
of the shack soars over 100 degrees.
   ``This is the best we could get,'' she said. ``But I think my
children will get something even better.''

<TEXT>
   A $400 million blend of big-league
film making and Hollywood stargazing is making its debut as
Florida's top entertainment resort opens its newest attraction _
the Disney-MGM Studios theme park.
   The 135-acre complex at Walt Disney World combines working
movie-TV sound studios with backstage tours for the public, a
mixed-media ride-through show and special effects adventures.
   It's all ``themed'' to the flamboyant ambience of Hollywood's
Golden Age in the 1930s and '40s, when a small group of moguls ran
the studios with a firm hand. Art deco and ``California Crazy''
dominated the architectural styles.
   The park has its own entrance admission and more than enough
activities to fill a visitor's entire day, Disney officials say.
   Visitors will walk through re-creations of palm-lined Hollywood
Boulevard and Grumman's Chinese Theater, peek at movies under
production, take a role in an ongoing television show, make their
own music videos, get a screen test and rub elbows with the stars
at the Brown Derby restaurant.
   Movie and television production began last summer with the
``Superboy'' syndicated TV series and parts of several large-screen
films, while construction continued on the tourist portion. Workers
were still putting finishing touches on it prior to the opening on
May 1.
   Chairman Michael Eisner describes it as one of the Disney Co.'s
most exciting projects.
   ``It is a theatrical environment that is very close to the
original conception by Walt Disney,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``It's been on the shelf since the 1940s and is the
culmination of a company dream. This attraction is unlike anything
else we have.''
   The grand opening to the public is preceded by a weekend of
glitzy celebrity parties and previews that include a special on
NBC-TV (April 30), and ``live'' tapings of the TV special and the
new ``Mickey Mouse Club'' television series.
   Dick Nunis, president of Walt Disney Attractions, believes
bringing a bit of Hollywood to Florida will lure new fans and
encourage former visitors to return.
   ``We talked of doing a studio tour when Walt was alive,'' said
Nunis. ``We've wanted to do this for a long, long time. It's a
dream come true.''
   Disney will get a full year's jump on its formidable
competition, Universal Studios Florida, which won't complete the
tour portion of its $500 million complex until May 1990.
   Situated just a few miles down the road, Universal is billed as
the nation's largest working studio outside of Hollywood. Movie and
TV production is already under way at the facility owned by MCA
Inc. and Rank Organization PLC of London. It is built on a 440-acre
site.
   Universal will feature what it calls a ``total experience'' of
Hollywood-style filmmaking to the public, making the visitor a
participant in the action. It expects to attract up to 6 million
visitors a year. Disney officials do not project attendance.
   Despite their well-publicized rivalry, Disney and MCA officials
downplay the situation, insisting the competition is good for each
other as well as Florida.
   ``We've always had competition _ from Sea World, Busch Gardens,
Cape Canaveral, Boardwalk and Baseball and many others,'' Eisner
said. ``We welcome competition. It's good for Central Florida.
Disney does things in its own way, and we feel comfortable that we
will have our niche in the community.''
   The Disney-MGM theme park is the centerpiece of a $1
billion-plus renaissance of the 27,400-acre resort situated in the
pine woods and citrus groves of Central Florida near Kissimmee and
Orlando.
   Not that a rebirth is needed.
   After earning a record $3.4 billion in revenues and $522 million
in profits in fiscal 1988, the Walt Disney Co. has on tap a number
of ``openings'' at its Florida resort this year in addition to the
studios.
   On schedule to open this fall is part of what it calls the
largest convention-hotel complex in the Southeast. Making their
debut this summer will be Typhoon Lagoon (``the world's largest
water park'') and the Pleasure Island nighttime entertainment
district.
   Built for the teen-age crowd, Nunis says Typhoon Lagoon will
make all other water attractions as obsolete as Disneyland made
amusement parks in 1955.
   ``We're finally going to be able to make waves,'' says Nunis.
``Surfing, a 100-foot mountain, a saltwater snorkling reef,
including sharks and other live critters (in an enclosed area). I
can hardly wait to put on my bathing suit.''
   Pleasure Island is for those who still have energy left at the
end of an exhausting day at the Disney-MGM Studios park, Epcot
Center or the Magic Kingdom. The complex of restaurants, shops and
nightclubs is built on a six-acre island at the Disney Village.
   On track to open this fall is the 770-room Swan Hotel, which
along with the larger Dolphin Hotel will form the lodging side of
the convention-hotel complex going up near Epcot Center. The
1,500-room Dolphin is to open in July 1990. Together, the two
hotels will cost about $375 million and provide 2,300 guest rooms
and 200,000 square feet of convention space beside a 50-acre lake.
   The more modestly priced Caribbean Beach Resort hotel opens an
additional 800 rooms this summer for a total of 2,112. The 907-room
Grand Floridian Beach Resort, a luxury Victorian-style hotel,
opened last summer.
   Also set for completion this fall will be a new Epcot pavilion,
the Wonders of Life, featuring a simulated ride through the human
bloodstream and a movie that takes a viewer from conception through
birth.
   Disney does not release attendance figures, but from early
indications at Walt Disney World _ and with the debut of its new
attractions and hotel rooms this year _ it may surpass the record
year of 1987. Its Florida parks racked up some 24 million
admissions then.
   Disney World's building spree is boosting its employment rolls
and its prices as well. Disney's minimum wage is $5 an hour and it
has little trouble attracting prospective employees.
   One of its most-popular spots these days is its employment
office, which is currently hiring 2,500 new workers to help staff
some of the new attractions. This will boost Disney's work force of
25,500 by 10 percent in one month.
   Shortly after the new park opens, Disney's total of 28,000
year-round ``cast members'' will be twice what it was eight years
ago. This figure is swelled by some 5,000 employees of companies
that run hotels, restaurants and shops on Disney property, plus
parttime workers during seasonal peaks, the company says.
   The new studio attraction has also prompted a $1 increase in
one-day admission prices at the Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center, and
the introduction of a new four-day passport good at any of the
three theme parks, effective May 1.
   The new ticket will cost $94 for adults and $77 for children 3
to 9 years old. It provides unlimited admission to the three parks
for four days. New single-day admission prices for any one park
will be $29 for adults and $23 for children.

   ``Eight Men Out'' (Orion Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated PG)
   
   Who's on first. What's on second. I don't know is on third.
Abbott and Costello made the skit a classic in 1945, and viewers of
``Eight Men Out'' might just revive it.
   The movie, as earnest as it may be in trying to present the
whole tangled scandal of the Chicago White Sox throwing the 1919
World Series, has enough faces and characters in it to pack a
locker room. And it would take extra innings to comprehend who's
doing what to whom.
   ``Eight Men Out'' begins just as the White Sox are about to meet
the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. The team is owned by a
penny-pinching, manipulative Charles Comiskey, who has driven
morale into the ground with his cheap wages.
   Enter scheming, sleazy gamblers to capitalize on the discontent.
The ball players are approached by a cast of underworld types, and
the deal is hatched for the team to allow the Reds to win the
series.
   During the conspiracy, director John Sayles introduces the eight
crooked players, their wives and sundry girlfriends, at least two
gambling kingpins and their assistants, the team's manager and
somebody's father.
   It takes a score card to keep track of the rest.
   The White-Sox-turned-Black-Sox yarn is a good one, but this
movie has too many loose threads.

   Symphony in B-flat; Psalm 23; Alexander Zemlinsky; Riccardo
Chailly conducting the Radio-Symphonie-Orchester Berlin and
Kammerchor (London)
   
   It's always a pleasure to come across an unfamiliar performer
giving a familiar work a superlative reading. It's even better to
discover exciting, lesser-known music, particularly when the
performance is as excellent as that of Chailly and the RSO on this
disc.
   Zemlinsky (1871-1942) was a prominent teacher, composer and
international conductor whose musicial life centered in Vienna. He
moved to Prague in 1938, escaped during the war to this country and
died, oddly, in Larchmont, N.Y., a suburb of New York City.
Schoenberg was his brother-in-law and pupil, and Webern also
studied with him. Mahler was a friend and supporter, and Brahms
recommended Zemlinsky to his own publisher. No lack of favor from
the musical community here.
   He wrote a quartet of string quartets, a half-dozen works for
orchestra and chorus, seven operas and three symphonies, including
the B-flat in 1897 _ the year of Brahms' death.
   The work sounds at times like a cross of the better halves of
Brahms and Mahler, though without their depth. But Zemlinsky has
his own world of orchestral sound. Chailly understands that. He
also seems to understand exactly what to do with each phrase, even
more so at times than Zemlinsky, whose style can seem fragmented.
   Psalm 23 sounds more Mahler-esque, maybe because of the chorus.
   The recorded sound of the orchestra is crystal clear and nigh
perfect. Instruments blend but stand out when need be, never out of
balance. The RSO musicians play difficult music with panache.
   Buy this disc not because no collection is complete without
Zemlinksy, but because no listener is complete without a desire to
hear the new and unfamiliar. And buy it because Chailly and the RSO
deliver a great performance.

   ``Blast Off'' (EMI USA) _ Stray Cats
   
   Now this is the way to do a rock 'n' roll reunion. Invite a
couple of buddies over, turn the speakers up real loud and _ to
steal a phrase _ blast off.
   The Stray Cats, pinup boys and rockabilly revivalists in the
long ago days of President Reagan's first term, drifted apart when
the hits stopped coming. Now they're back with ``Blast Off,'' an
unexpectedly delightful reunion LP that kicks, snarls, scratches
and bites.
   Unlike most ponderous reunions where middle aged rockers check
their lawyers at the door, ``Blast Off'' sounds like that jam
session with old friends where someone left a tape recorder on.
   Sure, it's more complicated than that. But it doesn't sound that
way, and that's the key.
   Age hasn't diminished the Cats' skill and spirit. It may even
have helped; singer Brian Setzer's voice has deepened into an
effective growl with none of the precocity of his youth.
   And producer Dave Edmunds, the ultimate kindred spirit, was a
perfect choice to guide this project. His voice brightens the
catchy singalong, ``Bring It Back Again.''
   Don't look for particularly deep statements. The Stray Cats must
set a record for most songs on one 10-song album with the word
``rock'' in the title (4). ``Everybody Needs Rock 'n' Roll,''
``Rockabilly Rules,'' ``Rockabilly Worlds'' and ``Rockin' All Over
the Place'' are all high octane.
   For what it aspires to _ the soundtrack for a terrific party _
``Blast Off'' is a howling success.

<TEXT>
   Kelly McGillis seems so strong-willed and
controlled both on the screen and off that you wonder if she ever
had doubts in her waitress days that she would reach the top of the
acting world.
   ``Oh yeah, all the time,'' she admits. ``But there's also that
part of you _ the driven side _ that says, `I will,' and has that
kind of confidence. But I think you will always have self-doubt. I
still do. I continually wonder if I would ever work again. Maybe
that's one of the things that drives me.''
   Contributing to her air of confidence is her appearance: stately
if not quite regal, with a cool beauty that would have melted the
late Alfred Hitchcock. Was her height ever a drawback?
   ``Not to me. Maybe to other people, but no, I don't think so. I
suppose people say, `How come you always play sort of stronger
women, not the vulnerable, victim types?' I can maybe attribute
that to my height. It's sort of hard to be a victim when you're
5-feet-10 and you're bigger than a lot of guys you're working
with.''
   Significantly, Jodie Foster was the gang-rape victim in ``The
Accused'' and McGillis was the prosecutor who sought justice for
her. In her new film, ``Winter People,'' McGillis plays both victim
and protagonist. She is an unwed mother, ostrasized by her family,
who stirs up a smoldering mountain feud and then resolves it with
an act of supreme sacrifice.
   The Columbia release was filmed in the locale of the John Ehle
novel, the Blue Ridge Mountains, under conditions that duplicated
the hardships of living on the land 50 years ago.
   ``It was pretty rough to be out in the elements for so many
hours a day,'' she recalled. ``It was cold and wet and damp.
   ``The emotional challenges of playing Coley Wright were very
demanding, but that's why I did it. I wanted to see if I could hit
those emotional peaks and valleys.
   ``Coley is a bit rebellious, but at the same time she is very
traditional. She is very strong and impetuous, but at the same time
very weak and feminine. Which are all sort of interesting things to
portray in a character, because that's how we are in real life.''
   Any resemblance between Coley and Kelly?
   ``Mmmm, yeah, I think so,'' she said. ``I think that I'm a bit
rebellious, and yet very traditional at the same time. And I think
I'm strong and weak at the same time. I'm very single-minded when I
get an idea; nothing can stand in my way or change my mind.''
   Filmmakers have discovered that about Kelly McGillis. While she
doesn't push her weight around on a set, she does like to
contribute to the creative process. And why not?
   ``I must say I've been very fortunate in not working with that
type of (dictatorial director). I've always felt that I could at
least bring up an idea, and they can say, `That's not a good idea,'
or, `I don't like that.' I don't take that personally.
   ``I've never worked with the kind of person who said, `Just shut
up and do it this way.' If I did, I probably would rebel a lot,''
she said.
   ``After a certain amount of time, an actor or an actress knows
their character better than anyone else around. Once you've
assimilated and really become this person, you know what you would
do in a given situation than anyone else on that set.''
   McGillis, 31, spent her early years in Thousand Oaks, halfway
between Los Angeles and Ventura. By a weird coincidence, her father
was physician for her ``Winter People'' co-star, Kurt Russell, then
a Disney child star.
   ``I had a big crush on him when I was 8 years old,'' she said.
   The McGillis family moved to Newport Beach in Orange County.
``We went on vacation and never came back.''
   ``When I was in high school I took theater,'' said McGillis,
whose new hair style is close-cropped blond and brown. ``I dropped
out of high school to pursue acting, which didn't make my family
happy. I studied a few years at the Pacific Conservatory of the
Performing Arts, then I was accepted to Julliard in New York, where
I studied for four years.''
   During her last year at the Julliard School, she auditioned for
a role with Tom Conti in ``Reuben, Reuben.'' She appeared in a few
TV movies without much notice. Then director Peter Weir saw her in
``Reuben, Reuben'' and wanted her to test for the Amish woman
opposite Harrison Ford in ``Witness.''
   ``I said, `Of course, I know all about the Amish,' but I really
didn't,'' she said, ``so I had to spend the weekend in the library.
   ``I had just gotten a job as a waitress in a restaurant where I
had wanted to work for a long, long time. When they finally offered
me `Witness' a week later, I felt so bad about quitting the other
job. You always want to work in a New York restaurant where there
is minimal work and a lot of money.''
   Even after the film she applied for another waitress job because
she was worried she'd never work again. ``Witness'' and ``Top Gun''
eased her insecurity.
   Now she can even take a few months off, as she and her boat
broker husband, Fred Tillman, recently did, ferrying a yacht from
the East Coast to San Diego.

<HEAD>The Artists: A Kaleidoscope of Art Deco Shapes and Forms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unprecedented show on art deco
brings together some of the best decorative works of the 1920s from
12 European nations to redefine the whimsical, elitist style of the
rich and powerful.
   In all, 274 pieces _ from fine jewelry and glassware to massive,
bulky dressers _ are on show until the end of May at the Beaux-Arts
Palace, itself an art deco gem, to mark its 60th anniversary this
year.
   The ``Art Deco in Europe'' exhibit aims to shed new light on the
much-abused concept of the movement by highlighting work from as
far apart as Sweden, Czechoslovakia and Italy. The style is an
eclectic ode to superficial prettiness for the rich who failed or
refused to face the harsh social realities of the 1920s.
   The difference between art deco and other styles of its age is
often very thin, said exhibit organizer Marc Lambrechts, explaining
why art deco has often been confused with, and used as, an amalgam
of everything from stark modernism to flamboyant rococo. The
kaleidoscope of forms and shapes at the Beaux-Arts Palace might
still leave many visitors lost for a uniform vision of art deco.
   But then, Art Deco loved to ``quote'' from foreign and bygone
styles, from the Japanese and Chinese cultures from rococo and
classicism, much in the same way that postmodernism does today.
   Lambrechts said only the social idea behind the pieces
constituted the art deco style. ``There is no unity of form, no
real style,'' he said, only a common attitude of snobbery and
elitism among art deco artists and buyers.
   Through his show, Lambrechts paints a picture of a gilded cage
in which a spoiled European elite sought to shield itself from the
revolutionary changes that swept society early this century. It did
so by cultivating an art that had no meaning other than to please
the eye.
   In contrast, the contemporary modernism of Le Corbusier and
Walter Gropius thrived on the new technologies and social
developments art deco shunned. Through its devotion to function and
lack of ornament, it gave shape to many of world's modern cities.
   ``In almost all the capitals of Europe, the high bourgeoisie
tried to compensate the threat to its power with a refined culture,
while the new rich wanted to create an identity by purely showing
off,'' Lambrechts said.
   In return, Art Deco was dismissed as kitschy and tasteless for
many decades. But in recent years it has found a new following as
evidenced by the fact that over 2,000 people a day visited
Lambrechts' show, which opened March 3 at Victor Horta's Beaux-Arts
Palace in the center of Brussels.
   France and Britain have long claimed to be the cradle of art
deco. But Lambrechts' show breaks new ground there. It shows strong
contributions from across Europe, many of them on display for the
first time outside their home countries.
   The exhibit is not as complete as Lambrechts would have liked,
as much art deco was destroyed in West Germany by the Nazis who
considered it decadent.
   Still, culled from 101 museums and private collections from
around Europe, it shows a lot of ``previously undiscovered beauty
among the best arts and crafts this century has produced,''
Lambrechts said.
   What all the pieces have in common is a sense of luxury, expert
finishing and craftmanship. Leaf-gold, silver, gems, china,
delicate woods _ no costs were spared to produce a unique work of
art deco.
   While modernists employed concrete and steel to allow function
to prevail over style, art deco only wanted to impress with its
flashy materials and ornaments.
   And impress they did.
   Dutchman Hendrik Van Den Eynde was lavish enough in his use of
silver. But his 1918 urn flanked by four statuettes, shows some of
the restraint other works at the show dearly lack.
   At the other end of the spectrum, Austrian Anny Schroeder
outrages with loud, clashing colors and seemingly irrelevant
drawings of hunters and exotic deer on her 1919 mask.
   And nowhere is craftmanship and use of rich materials more
evident than in the art deco jewelry of the Maison Van Cleef and
Arpels.
   Its 1927 vanity brooch of gold, enamel, christal, emerald,
rubies and diamonds wrought by master hands is one of the
highlights of the exibit.
   After spending some decades in relative obscurity, dealers are
also quickly re-evaluating art deco. Some small tables have been
sold for close to $1 million, and prices for all objects are rising
constantly.
   ``Times have changed,'' said Lambrechts. ``Today art deco is
even more expensive than French art of the 18th century.''

   Tone Loc, the raspy-voiced rapper whose bawdy
``Wild Thing'' went to the top of the charts, didn't think the tune
about a pickup artist on a streak of amazing luck was hit material.
   ``The record company (Delicious Vinyl) did. I didn't. It's not
my style of rap,'' the 22-year-old Los Angeles native said in a
recent interview. ``I mean, `Loc'd After Dark' is really my style
of rap _ slow and funky, that's how I like it.''
   The song was a No. 1 hit for Loc, whose real name is Tony Smith.
Loc is short for loco, a gang term for a crazy man who likes to
fight.
   But Loc, who grew up in a two-story house on the affluent west
side of Los Angeles and went to University High School and Santa
Monica College, had to travel by bus to the city's tough south side
to get his reputation.
   He was uncomforable dwelling on gangs during the interview.
However, in the past he has said he was involved with a gang during
his teens but withdrew because a girlfriend asked him to _ a choice
kids locked into the southside scene usually don't get.
   But his commuter-gang experience had nothing to do with his
interest in rap, he said. ``I found it out on my own, clear out of
the blue.''
   Loc said a friend from New Jersey came to Los Angeles about
eight years ago with a tape that he rapped along to.
   ``I never saw anybody rap live before. It was pretty new,
especially out here. I went home and tried to write one of my own,
and it sounded pretty cool,'' he said.
   All the original big rappers, such as Kurtis Blow and Kool Moe
Dee, were from the East Coast. Only recently have West Coast
rappers been taken seriously in the genre. Early 1980s acts such as
the LA Dream Team failing to take hold. Loc said the West Coast
rappers now have developed their own laid-back style rather than
trying to imitate the uptempo hip-hop from the East.
   ``We've grown tremendously out here,'' he said. ``We've got a
groove that slow. I'm a slower, more mellow type.''
   Loc's own rap experience came during high school, with a group
called the Triple A's because all the members first names began
with ``A.''
   ``There really wasn't too much happening with it. I think we
were too good for our time,'' he said. Loc was a rap retiree by age
20, but took it up again when the Los Angeles rap scene began to
heat up. A cousin introduced him to Matt Dike and Mike Ross,
founders of the small Delicious Vinyl label, and two of Loc's
records, ``I Got It Goin' On'' and ``I'm on Fire,'' received play
on local station KDAY.
   But it was the crossover appeal of ``Wild Thing,'' which got
play on new wave station KROQ in Los Angeles last fall, that helped
launch Loc, Los Angeles rap, and Delicious Vinyl, now distributed
by Island Records.
   As for ``Wild Thing,'' Loc said he pieced the song together
pretty much from personal experience.
   ``You change a little bit here and there, but the idea comes
from something that happened to you,'' he said.
   Does he get any static for the lyrics?
   ``Nah. All the girls I know love it,'' he laughed. ``Besides,
they know it's all true.''
   Loc is currently on tour for his album ``Loc'd After Dark,''
which is climbing the Billboard pop and black charts, facing crowds
of up to 18,000 in arenas.
   ``I was playing clubs in January and February,'' he said. ``It's
different, but it's the same. I really like the hype.''
   And the crowds join in on ``Wild Thing.''
   ``They rap right along with it,'' Loc said.
   Loc is casual so far about his own success. When asked, he
didn't know exactly where his records were on the charts, except to
say ``I know a lot of people are buying them.''
   There is also street recognition for the husky 6-foot-1 Loc, who
appears in the heavy rotation ``Wild Thing'' video clip, which
borrows the expressionless all-woman band from Robert Palmer's ``I
Didn't Mean to Turn You On.''
   Loc's own stock is soaring, and he finds some things more
difficult to do, such as shopping in a mall.
   ``When I'm shopping or eating, I get swarmed. You can hear
people saying `Is that Tone Loc? Yeah, that's him.' But they're
always nice to me and stuff, and I love that. Plus, I can get into
a lot more clubs now,'' he said laughing.
   ``It's nothing like Michael Jackson or anything, but I can
definitely tell the difference,'' he said.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: V.S. Naipaul Takes His Turn in the South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From ``Gone With the Wind'' to ``A Southern
Family,'' writers have addressed the South with much sound and fury.
   But V.S. Naipaul has used his acute eye to furnish some fresh
insights in ``A Turn in the South.''
   Naipaul, a Trinidadian of Indian descent who has lived in
England for nearly four decades, spent six months traveling through
the South, studying race relations, religion, the romance with the
past and its wary concessions to progress.
   ``A Turn in the South'' (Knopf; $18.95) takes the reader from
Greensboro, N.C., where Naipaul begins his sojourn, through
Atlanta; Charleston, S.C.; Tallahassee, Fla.; Tuskegee, Ala.;
Jackson, Miss.; Nashville, Tenn., and back to North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. He shows us Confederate monuments and catfish ponds, a
self-proclaimed redneck and a Nashville songwriter, fundamentalist
preachers and a futuristic Nissan assembly plant.
   The Oxford-educated Naipaul is the author of 19 other books,
eight of them non-fiction works such as this one in which he
exhaustively explores a locale; they are much too complex to be
considered mere travel books. He is best known for his caustic
pictorials of Third World countries, in both his nonfiction
(``India: A Wounded Civilization,'' ``The Loss of El Dorado,''
``The Middle Passage'') and his novels (``A Bend in the River,''
``Guerrillas,'' ``In a Free State'').
   For example, ``Among the Believers,'' his controversial 1981
account of the Islamic faith in Iran, Pakistan and Indonesia,
probably would elicit a death threat from the Ayatollah Khomeini if
it were issued today.
   One of the pleasures of reading ``A Turn in the South'' is
experiencing the Southern United States through the eyes of a world
traveler. ``The land was flat, like the pampas of Argentina or the
llanos of Venezuela,'' Naipaul writes of Greensboro.
   Interviewing Naipaul about the writing of this book is another
experience altogether. He detests interviews, submits to them only
on the insistence of his publisher and endures them with a pained
air and mostly terse responses.
   Asked in a recent interview, for example, to explain what kind
of advance work he does before setting out on a destination, he
said curtly: ``I don't. I don't do any research.''
   When the interviewer points out that in his book he says he has
obtained letters of introduction, that this sounds like advance
preparation, and asks him how he decides whom to contact, Naipaul
responded, ``That is always difficult.''
   When pressed to elaborate, he would add only, ``It varies from
place to place. It is one of the difficulties of the traveling
business.''
   Asked if he read any Southern authors beforehand, such as
William Faulkner or Eudora Welty (whom he interviewed in ``A Turn
in the South''), he snapped: ``That's fatal. I always refuse to
read in advance.''
   After a pause he added, ``I always try to see what I've found.
I'm a fairly well-educated, well-read person, and I've spent all my
life writing, and I have a rough idea of the history of places. I
like to go and see what I find and move from there. I don't want to
be reacting against other people's views.''
   In ``A Turn in the South'' Naipaul writes that this will be his
last travel theme book. Why abandon a format that has served him so
well?
   ``I felt it at the time. I felt I was getting on,'' said
Naipaul, who is 56. ``But what happened was I was so energized by
it (researching the book), so excited, so delighted _ I was so
delighted by the method I had stumbled on in my middle 50s. I found
it so true and interesting, and I so marveled that I hadn't
alighted on it before. I found that at the end of it quite a bit of
energy remaining _ or generated _ and I thought I should do a
little more before my chest absolutely packs up on me.'' (Naipaul
suffers from asthma.)
   The methodology to which he referred is to interview a wide
range of people and to let them do the talking, rather than his old
habit of spending a long period in a given place, quietly observing
and analyzing, which he now says gives a more prejudiced account.
Naipaul seems unaware that the ``new'' method he has stumbled upon
is that used daily by journalists.
   Naipaul's next trip will be to India, where he has traveled
extensively, but he didn't know if a book would come of it. He said
that because of his poor health he views every book as his last.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Roy Clark A Country Music Ambassador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Country music performer Roy Clark, the
longtime star of the ``Hee Haw'' TV show, thinks the cornpone
program would be received well in the Soviet Union.
   Clark has made two concert tours of the Soviet Union, most
recently giving 12 performances last November. He previously made
18 concert appearances in 1976.
   ``I'm sure they would be bewildered by the corny jokes, but the
overall image of `Hee Haw' would be compatible with their
entertainment,'' Clark said in an interview. ``They are interested
in the history of the American West such as the cowboys.
   ``You see audiences in Europe in fringe and cowboy hats and the
Soviets are the same way. They would identify with that image of
`Hee Haw.' ''
   The 56-year-old Clark, who has been host of the show since it
first aired 21 years ago, foresees an entire wave of new viewers.
   ``There's a generation of young people who get together on
Saturday nights and use it as an excuse to have a party in the
(college) dorm,'' he said. ``It's gone around and made a complete
cycle. We may become another fad. I have a feeling it will outlast
me.''
   The program, which is seen on more than 200 stations, is taped
every June and October. Clark says the fact that it's not a
months-long process has contributed to the show's longevity.
   ``This keeps it fresh,'' he said by telephone from his office in
Tulsa, Okla. ``We're not around each other enough to get on each
other's nerves. It's a natural high energy for us to perform
because it's like starting over twice a year.''
   When Clark first appeared on the show, he already had been
performing on prime-time network TV variety shows. But he said
``Hee Haw'' capped his career.
   ``This was the icing on the cake,'' he said. ``This put my face
and name together.''
   His recent appearances in the Soviet Union have embellished his
role as one of country music's major ambassadors. After his first
tour there 13 years ago, which was made with the Oak Ridge Boys,
the Country Music Association gave him the title ``international
friendship ambassador.''
   He also performed in Bulgaria last year where his concert was
broadcast live and seen by more than 500 million people in
socialist countries.
   ``There's a special feeling when you play in a foreign
country,'' Clark said. ``It's not just another concert. There is a
lot of responsibility on your shoulders.
   ``You are representing your country first of all. Also you must
represent your music well. The opinions of your performance
reflects back on all the other country music performers. If the
people don't like it, they will think that's what all of country
music is like.
   ``Your adrenalin definitely flows a little faster.''
   His appearances were taped for television broadcast throughout
Eastern Bloc countries. Soviet officials told him his concerts
would be seen by 700 million people by the time they are broadcast
and rebroadcast several times.
   In the United States, The Nashville Network on cable TV is
carrying two one-hour specials about Clark's Soviet shows.
   Clark said such a huge audience is a bit intimidating.
   ``The first thing you think about is how many mistakes you
made,'' he said, chuckling. ``You wonder how many flat notes you
hit and whether you looked tired and were at your best.
   ``But it was gratifying. There's nothing like recognition.''
   He said the Soviet people were especially interested in the
banjo. Crowds would gather at the foot of the stage to get a close
look at his instruments, especially the banjo.
   ``You could tune one up and they would love it,'' Clark said.
``They know the history of it as an authentic American instrument.
They know it speaks of our heritage. And they like that brilliant
sound of the banjo.''
   Clark, a native of Meherrin, Va., grew up in Staten Island,
N.Y., St. Clairsville, Ohio, and Washington. His father was a
computer programmer for the federal government.
   He learned to play a homemade ukulele as a youngster and got his
first guitar at age 14. He is accomplished on the 12-string guitar,
acoustic guitar, banjo and fiddle and also plays five other
instruments.
   Clark has dabbled in acting, co-starring in the 1986 movie
``Uphill All the Way'' with Mel Tillis. He's also appeared in the
TV shows ``The Odd Couple'' and ``The Beverly Hillbillies.''
   He is now approaching 30 years as a performer, having celebrated
his 25th anniversary in 1985, and his foreign concert tours are not
over. He plans to return to the Soviet Union within two years.
   ``I'd like to keep the friendship going,'' Clark said.

   Eastern Airlines would slash its workforce by 43
percent from pre-strike levels and raise $1.8 billion from asset
sales under a new business plan presented to the airline's
creditors.
   The proposal, which must be approved by creditors and a federal
bankruptcy judge, calls for Eastern to reduce its fleet size to 157
aircraft from 255 and the number of cities served to 77 from a
pre-strike 102.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes on Monday would not specify all the

   The scandal and a widely criticized sales tax that took effect
April 1 sent his popularity rating skidding to a rock-bottom 3.9

World War II.
   Takeshita, 65, spoke at a nationally televised news conference

   Nearly a century after Chauncey Wing
invented a simple device to stick mailing labels onto newspapers,
his great-grandson is turning out almost identical Wing Mailers,
handcrafted on turn-of-the-century lathes, for modern newspapers.
   ``Times change, but the Wing Mailer just goes along,'' said
Donald Wing, the latest in the long line of Yankee tinkerers and
inventors to preside over the little brick mill in this
northwestern Massachusetts town.
   He estimated that 3,000 to 4,000 of the devices are being used
by newspapers ranging from large metropolitan dailies, such as The
Boston Globe and the Hartford Courant, to hometown weeklies.
   ``Many bigger papers use it to back up their computerized
systems. The fancy electronics are only as good as the people who
operate and fix them and they still have to get out the papers when
the power goes off,'' said Wing. ``And for the smaller papers it
can be a lot more economical.''
   The device, which feeds a strip of mailing labels through a glue
well and then cuts and affixes the labels onto the newspapers with
a pull of the thumb, was invented in 1894.
   The family-owned company still occasionally gets back for
repairs mailers made 50 and 60 years ago, said Paul Sevrens, who
manages the five-employee factory. The only difference between
these older models and the ones made today is that after the 1920s,
the mailers were made of aluminum instead of brass. Today the
mailers cost about $215.
   Even the cherry-wood handles that Chancey Wing and James A.
Horton, editor of the Greenfield Gazette and Courier, chose for the
mailer when Grover Cleveland was in the White House remain, still
turned on a foot-driven lathe.
   ``There would be no purpose to changing,'' said Wing, 45. ``Our
customers are familiar with it as it is. And we don't care about
being modern.''
   In its one concession to the computer age, the company last year
unveiled a new model, without a glue well, to handle pre-glued
computer labels. But otherwise the 2{-pound machine that has
outlasted all its competitors is a hand-held anachronism in the
heavily computerized newspaper industry.
   The factory's only pause was during World War II when Henry
Wing, Donald's father, halted production to mill parts for
top-secret radar research.
   The company's sales, including supplies, totaled $250,000 last
year, Wing said.
   To step into the plant, near the family home, is to walk into
the 19th century.
   ``Most of the machines were made here and some even predate the
mailer,'' said Wing. A turn-of-the-century, five-horsepower
electric motor in the basement powers the more than two dozen gear
cutters, taps, dies and presses through an intricate arrangement of
leather belts and pulleys that whir overhead.
   ``The electric bill for the whole plant is about $20 a month,''
said Sevrens' wife, Peggy, the office manager.
   It's hard to find people with the skill and inclination to work,
often by eye, on the old machines, Sevrens said, but his
fascination came early.
   ``I grew up in the neighborhood and did odd jobs for Henry
Wing,'' said the young machinist. ``He was interested in everything
and always working on all sorts of things. Tinkering. I just
thought he was kind of a neat guy.''
   Richard Haskins, 78, who retired and returned twice ``because I
don't have a place where I can have a hobby,'' said he wouldn't
want to work on a modern, computerized milling machine.
   ``There's a nature to man that can be lost,'' he said. ``A
machine can make a standard socket, but when you're finished
there's nothing of toolmaker in it.''

   First Boston Corp. said the Wall Street slowdown
has prompted the investment firm to reduce its staff by about 200
employees through a combination of attrition, voluntary departures
and layoffs.
   The nation's sixth-largest investment firm said Monday the
reductions were being made this week.
   Spokeswoman Monica Prihoda declined to say how many people were
being fired or from which departments the cuts were being made.
   First Boston Chief Executive William Mayer said in a memo to the
company's workers that the cuts were being made ``to reflect
current business conditions.''
   ``For well over a year, nearly every area of business has been
impacted by a weak market,'' Mayer said. ``Those of you who have
been in the industry for longer than five years are familiar with
up and down cycles. First Boston is not alone: all securities firms
are feeling the pressure.''
   The cuts trim First Boston's payroll to 4,700, about 1,000 fewer
than before the October 1987 stock market crash.
   The firm said it would remain active in all current areas of
business.
   The reductions come amid a series of announcements of earnings
declines and losses on Wall Street.
   On Monday, Salomon Inc. reported a $28 million first-quarter
loss, with its energy business compensating for $150 million in
losses by securities and commodities segments. Several other firms
earlier reported earnings drops.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. last week announced it would sell
its retail brokerage unit, which has 2,300 workers, because of poor
business. A deal with Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co. was reported
close Monday, but both firms declined to comment.

   Fairchild Industries Inc. has announced it
will sell one of its industrial product operations to a group of
senior managers.
   The terms of the sale, disclosed Monday, were not announced.
   The operation, Fairchild Industrial Products Co. of
Winston-Salem, N.C., makes pneumatic and electronic controls for
industrial and commercial markets.
   The operation, which employs about 150 workers, accounted for 10
percent of the revenues and 15 percent of the profits of the
company's industrial products division, according to Deborah
Tucker, a company spokeswoman.
   The overall division, which has two other components,
contributed $150 million in revenues and about $19.7 million in
profits to the parent firm last year, Ms. Tucker said.
   Fairchild put the three companies in the division up for sale in
1987. When no acceptable offers were submitted by last year, Ms.
Tucker said, the operations were pulled from the market, although
quiet negotiations continued.
   Fairchild and The Carlyle Group, a Washington-based merchant
bank, are negotiating for a sale of the entire company. Ms. Tucker
said the sale of the division was not related to those ongoing
talks.
   Fairchild is a diversified aerospace company.

<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. can
revive its stagnant U.S. sales and pull away from competitors by
getting closer to its customers, Chairman John F. Akers told
shareholders at their annual meeting.
   ``IBM must become a company ... that won't rest until every
customer is not just satisfied, but delighted, with every
association with IBM,'' he said here Monday. ``Everything else will
follow, market share, revenue, profit, returns and stockholder
value.
   ``We intend to accomplish all this ... not by selling them
smaller and faster machines to replace more clerical duties, but
rather working more closely with them to get an ever deeper
understanding of their businesses,'' he said.
   IBM's revenue in the United States, the largest single market
for the world's largest computer manufacturer, declined 0.7 percent
last year to $25.3 billion.
   Measured in local currencies, South American sales grew 21
percent last year, the most among IBM's major geographic markets,
Akers said. Revenue in local currencies grew by 14 percent in Asia
and the Pacific, and by 9 percent in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa.
   Because of changes in the value of the dollar in terms of
various foreign currencies, the dollar value of foreign revenue was
different from the value in local currencies.
   Overall, revenue outside the United States increased 15.5
percent to $34.4 billion when measured in dollars. By the same
measure, the greatest revenue growth was 27.7 percent in Asia and
the Pacific, followed by growth of 21 percent to $3.9 billion in
the Americas, according to the company's annual report.
   Akers said IBM is battling rapid advances in computer
technology, growing needs of customers and thousands of competing
companies, from the small and nimble to the big full-line vendors.
   ``As a result, the industry is under a good deal of stress as
evidenced by pressure on profitability and decline in stock prices,
including IBM's stock price, over the last several months,'' he
said.
   IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., remains ``the most profitable
company in the world and continues to lead all American companies
in market value,'' Akers said.
   First-quarter profit totaled $950 million, or $1.61 per share,
on revenue of $12.7 billion. After adopting a new treatment of
deferred taxes, IBM restated its 1988 first-quarter profit as $1.2
billion, or $1.57 per share, on revenue of $12 billion.
   Without the accounting change, the 1989 first quarter would have
represented a 1.8 percent increase in profits.
   While in Pittsburgh for the annual shareholders meeting Monday,
the board increased the regular quarterly dividend 10 percent, from
$1.10 per share to $1.21 per share.
   Management received overwhelming support for a proposal to
expand a program of awarding stock options to executives. The
company's Long-Term Peformance Plan will enable the top officers to
receive stock as well as cash.
   Shareholders rejected a proposal to force IBM to discontinue
selling computers and services in South Africa, where it no longer
owns a subsidiary. The proposal was supported by 14.5 percent of
the shares voted.
   A proposal that would have required management to report to
shareholders on any ways in which IBM supports painful laboratory
experiments on animals received 7.8 percent of the shares voted.
   Management opposed both proposals.

   Minorco's $4 billion bid expires at 1 p.m. London time
Wednesday, and unless the Luxembourg-based conglomerate is able to
acquire half of Gold Fields' shares by the deadline, it would be
barred from attempting another takeover for one year under British
law.
   Minorco controls 29.6 percent of the stock of Gold Fields.
   Last month, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan
upheld Mukasey's original injunction against further Gold Fields
stock acquisition by Minorco because it might violate U.S.
antitrust laws.
   Minorco, through its various holdings, ``is the largest producer
of gold in the non-communist world, accounting for 20.3 percent of
all gold production,'' according to court papers.
   Last fall, Minorco, which is largely controlled by two South
African corporations, Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and
De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., launched a hostile takeover bid
for Gold Fields.
   But Gold Fields resisted and filed an antitrust action in New
York, sparking one of the largest takeover battles in British
history.
   Mukasey's preliminary injunction last fall prevented Minorco
from proceeding with its tender offer until the antitrust issue is
resolved.
   Just before Mukasey's ruling, the bid was referred to Britain's
Monopolies and Mergers Commission to consider possible
anti-competitive consequences in the United Kingdom on such
strategic metals as titanium and zircon.
   British law prohibited further action on the takeover bid until
Feb. 2, when the commission held that acquisition of Gold Fields
would not be against the British public interest.
   With that ruling, Mukasey's injunction remained the only legal
obstacle to Minorco's offer.
   Last week, Mukasey rejected a Minorco bid to lift or modify the
stay.
   To eliminate antitrust conflicts, Minorco offered to sell
substantial Gold Fields subsidiaries _ Gold Fields of South Africa,
U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corp. and Australian-based Renison
Goldfields Ltd. _ and not buy them back for 10 years.
   But Mukasey said there was no guarantee the other Minorco-linked
entities _ DeBeers and Anglo American _ wouldn't buy back the
subsidiaries and keep the transactions secret under sympathetic
South African laws.
   He noted at the time that he ``enjoined the takeover because the
resulting combination would control 32.3 percent of the
non-communist world gold market.''
   On Monday, Minorco, Anglo and DeBeers offered to put up a total
of $300 million bond and pledged not only to sell the previously
mentioned properties but to not buy them back for at least 10 years.
   But Mukasey rejected that offer because, he said, ``members of
the Anglo group other than Anglo, DeBeers ... remain free to
purchase shares in the three companies.''

<HEAD>Eastern Could Have Much Different Shape Under Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The contours of strike-torn Eastern Airlines
could be markedly changed under management's proposed plan to
rebuild as a smaller carrier and sell $1.8 billion in assets.
   The plan presented Monday to Eastern's major creditors, which
must be approved by them and a federal bankruptcy judge, would
slash the airline's work force by 43 percent from levels before the
strike that started March 4. Eastern's unions as well as U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland have been pushing for a sale of
the entire carrier by its parent, Texas Air Corp.
   If management's plan were approved, Miami-based Eastern would
cut its fleet size to 157 aircraft from the current 255 and the
number of cities served to 77 from a pre-strike 102.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes would not specify all the cities
where Eastern would cut service, but told a press briefing the
company would sell its Northeast shuttle service and Philadelphia
hub, along with a total of 117 unspecified airport gates and 28
landing slots, and de-emphasize some foreign routes.
   While keeping many of the plan's details under wraps, Bakes did
say Eastern would retain its Atlanta hub, its routes linking
Northeast cities with Florida and some or all of its Caribbean
service. The Atlanta hub, which vies with Delta Air Lines, accounts
for 35 percent to 40 percent of Eastern's total revenue.
   ``I think it's very aggressive but I think it's possible,'' said
Raymond Neidl, a securities analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei
Inc. who follows Texas Air.
   Neidl and other observers believe the plan could strip Eastern
down mainly to its heavy North-South routes on the East Coast,
eliminating its East-West runs. As the airline's network is
currently structured, the East Coast is densely covered but routes
become much sparser as they move west _ they mainly include cities
such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, Seattle, Portland,
Ore., and Salt Lake City.
   Eastern also could sell its South American routes and part of
its Caribbean service, possibly including its hub in San Juan,
Puerto Rico, Neidl suggested.
   Eastern has been flying substantially reduced schedules since a
March 4 strike by its Machinists union, which was joined by
Eastern's pilots and flight attendants unions. The company sought
federal bankruptcy court protection from creditors on March 9.
   Under the new plan, Eastern would emerge from Chapter 11 by
September, Bakes said _ a target that Neidl called overly
optimistic.
   Fleet size would be reduced by aircraft sales and by leasing
planes to other carriers, Bakes said.
   Employment at the scaled-down Eastern would total about 17,000,
down from a pre-strike 30,000, Bakes said. The total would include
1,700 pilots, down from 3,600 before the strike, he said.
   Eastern would cut its daily scheduled flight hours to 1,473 from
2,076 under the plan.
   Dan Ashby, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, said
the plan would not work, partly because Eastern would not be able
to get enough pilots to fly its planes.
   Bakes said Eastern plans to hire and train new pilots at the
rate of 200 a month.
   Eastern indicated that by yearend under the plan it would have
$1.8 billion in net cash from asset sales, giving it a net cash
balance of $774 million after paying creditors and pension
obligations.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo has insisted he no longer is
interested in selling all of Eastern, following the collapse of a
proposed $464 million deal with a group led by former Baseball
Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth.
   The federal bankruptcy examiner for Eastern said Monday that
further bids to acquire the airline could be made as early as this
week by suitors who include hotel executive Jay Pritzker and Trans
World Airlines Inc. Chairman Carl C. Icahn.

<HEAD>NCNB Drops C&amp;S Takeover Bid That Would Have Been Largest Bank Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rather than wage a bitter battle with
Citizens &amp; Southern Corp. of Atlanta, NCNB Corp. has withdrawn its
$2.4 billion takeover attempt, scuttling what would have been the
largest merger in U.S. banking history.
   ``I recommended to our board of directors that we terminate the
offer,'' NCNB Chairman Hugh McColl said Monday.
   ``I did so because, as was evident in our proposal and
throughout subsequent communications, we were committed to a
friendly merger,'' he said. ``The management and directors of C&amp;S,
for reasons satisfactory to themselves, have decided not to accept
our offer. I see no benefit in continuing it.''
   The announcement was made after the close of trading Monday on
the New York Stock Exchange. NCNB had risen 25 cents a share to
$36.37{ and Citizens &amp; Southern had fallen 62{ cents a share to $34.
   The merger, which consisted of a stock swap, would have created
the nation's sixth-largest banking company. But the Atlanta bank
refused to discuss the proposal.
   C&amp;S chairman Bennett Brown said he ``believed from the beginning
that this offer was not in the best interests of our shareholders,
customers, employees and communities, and that it would meet
significant regulatory difficulties and public policy concern.''
   ``Both these fine institutions can now get back to the business
of banking and serving their communities,'' Brown said.
   One analyst said he wasn't surprised by McColl's decision to
drop the bid because NCNB needed the merger to be friendly.
   ``They wanted to retain the management strengths of C&amp;S,'' said
the analyst, Dennis Shea of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.
   Just four months ago, NCNB, which has assets of more than $50
billion, effectively doubled its size when it was selected by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to acquire the largest bank in
Texas, First RepublicBank Corp.
   Since 1982, NCNB has expanded aggressively into new markets in
Florida, South Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee. The First
RepublicBank move was the biggest until the C&amp;S offer.
   Tony Davis, a bank stock analyst with Wheat First Securities in
Richmond, Va., agreed that NCNB could not go ahead with the
takeover bid without the support of C&amp;S's managment.
   ``I think you have to take them at their word,'' he said. ``They
said they wanted a friendly merger. It was important as they
approached the Georgia market that they had the endorsement of the
folks at C&amp;S.''
   Chris Davis of Wheat First's Charlotte office added that NCNB
needed a friendly merger because ``they have a full plate in
Texas.''
   Shea said NCNB was going after a respected bank with a strong
management team that could have offered the Charlotte bank
considerable help down the road in its expansion into Texas and
Florida.
   ``If C&amp;S continued to refuse to negotiate, NCNB was not going to
pull off a friendly merger,'' he said. ``I think NCNB realized that
it could not negotiate in a vacuum. They couldn't just keep upping
the price.''
   Shea also suggested that NCNB may have underestimated C&amp;S's
unwillingness to participate in the deal.
   NCNB made the offer, which would have created a banking company
with assets of $76 billion, on March 30, and on April 3, the C&amp;S
board rejected the offer. At the time, C&amp;S called the bid
``inadequate,'' and said C&amp;S' present management was better able to
serve the bank's customers, shareholders and communities than NCNB.
   NCNB continued to court C&amp;S, asking for face-to-face meetings,
and adding different elements to the proposals, including a plan to
move NCNB's Southeast banking headquarters to Atlanta.
   On April 13, McColl visited Atlanta and vowed to continue to
pursue to the offer, though he did not meet with any C&amp;S officials.
Five days later, C&amp;S Chairman Bennett Brown urged shareholders to
support the C&amp;S board in its rejection of the NCNB offer.
   ``Let me put it bluntly,'' Brown said at the time. ``NCNB cannot
afford C&amp;S.''
   Last week, McColl announced that his bank would increase its bid
if C&amp;S officials agreed to meet with NCNB executives. McColl did
not indicate how high the offer would go.

<HEAD>NWA Board Rejects Davis Offer, Amends Court Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Calling parts of oilman Marvin Davis' $2.7
billion bid for Northwest Airlines illegal and unfinanced, NWA
Inc.'s board of directors unanimously rejected the offer and moved
to take further court action to block the efforts.
   The board on Monday reaffirmed its willingness to negotiate with
suitors, including Davis, ``in the interest of producing a
transaction that is in the best interests of all NWA
shareholders.'' But it said it will seek a quick hearing on a
motion to enjoin Davis' $90-a-share tender offer.
   The board also said it is working with an undisclosed number of
other parties that have indicated an interest in acquiring
Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest carrier.
   NWA stock closed at $102.75 Monday, up 25 cents a share in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   In an amended complaint in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis,
the NWA board said Davis' financing plan would exceed federal
margin rules aimed at limiting the amount of credit used to buy
stock. The board said $1.25 billion in preferred stock financing
planned for Davis' buyout actually should be considered debt.
   The motion also claims Davis' tender offer actually was an
illegal proxy solicitation that provided insufficient information
to shareholders regarding the source and availability of $450
million in equity Davis said he would provide for the buyout.
   In addition, Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch said
Monday he found Davis Acquisition Inc.'s registration statement
offering to purchase all of NWA Inc.'s outstanding shares deficient.
   Hatch said Davis failed to disclose the manner in which he would
operate NWA so as to expand its operation and not dispose of
``strategic'' assets of the company or lay off employees.
   Additionally, the commissioner said, Davis did not disclose
plans relating to an Airbus maintenance facility that he said he
intended to locate in Minnesota.
   Hatch scheduled a hearing on the matter for this evening, and
said the registration would be suspended Friday if the deficiencies
are not corrected.
   Jim Fingeroth, a Davis spokesman, said the acquisition company
had no comment on the order.
   Davis' attorneys, meanwhile, were shoring up their efforts in
Delaware, where NWA is incorporated. His lawyers argued in a
Wilmington, Del., court against a provision in NWA's ``poison
pill'' takeover defense that is hindering his efforts to put a new
NWA board of directors in place.
   The defense effectively would block a new board of directors
from selling NWA for 180 days.
   The prospect of a long delay would discourage shareholders from
supporting Davis in the proxy fight planned at NWA's May 15 annual
meeting, attorney Gilchrist Sparks told the hearing.
   NWA Chairman Steven Rothmeier has said he prefers to see the
airline remain independent or find a ``white knight'' investor to
work with current management.
   In letters to the 5,000 union pilots at Northwest, Rothmeier
said last week that ``there are alternatives available to us from
friendly investors.''
   But, he said, the assistance is contingent upon a contract
settlement with the pilots, who have been working under two
separate contracts since Northwest acquired Republic Airlines in
1986.
   Davis' Delaware court action altered the course of his fight
against the Northwest poison pill. He initially sought to
invalidate the entire poison plan, which would more than double the
cost of a potential acquisition by a hostile bidder by flooding the
market with new NWA shares.
   But Sparks said Monday that Davis would like to retain the pill
for his own use in the event he gained control of the board.
   Rothmeier has declined to identify any potential friendly
investors, but the company has said a group holding 4.9 percent of
NWA's 29.1 million shares outstanding is interested in a leveraged
buyout. In a leveraged buyout, a company is bought with largely
borrowed funds.
   The group includes Los Angeles-based investor Alfred Checchi and
former NWA board member Gary Wilson, now an executive for Walt
Disney Co.
   The New York Times reported Monday that Kelso &amp; Co., a small
investment bank based in New York, is considering a bid for the
airline. Spokesman for Kelso and Northwest declined to comment.

<HEAD>Drexel, Rothschild Workers Sue Over Layoffs, Plans To Sell Brokerage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laid-off workers at the Wall Street brokerage
L.F. Rothschild &amp; Co. have sued their former employer under the new
federal plant closing law, while three Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
employees have sued that investment house over its plans to sell
its retail brokerage business.
   The Rothschild employees claim they were dismissed without the
60 days' notice required under the plant-closing law.
   A lawyer for the workers said Monday he did not know of any
other suits filed under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, which took effect Feb. 4. The workers were laid
off March 10.
   Though the act is known popularly as the plant closing law, it
applies to any company with at least 100 employees in all and at
least 50 at one site. Such firms must give workers 60 days' notice
of a shutdown or mass layoffs.
   The lawyer, Jeffrey G. Smith, said L.F. Rothschild laid off
about 250 workers at its Manhattan headquarters without warning.
The suit, seeking back pay and punitive damages, was filed Friday
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by seven former employees as a
class action.
   The suit said Rothschild was one of the 20 largest brokerage
houses in the nation, with more than $300 million in capital,
before the October 1987 stock market crash.
   The firm suffered heavy losses in the crash and was purchased in
June by a subsidiary of Franklin Savings Association, a savings and
loan based in Ottawa, Kan. But it continued to lose money, and the
layoffs ensued.
   In a letter announcing the layoffs, Rothschild told its
employees the plant closing law did not apply because the company
had been ``pursuing a realistic opportunity'' to have a lender bail
it out and avert the layoffs.
   Smith said the law did offer such an exemption, on grounds that
a layoff notice would scare off potential lenders.
   But he said in this case the bailout apparently was being
considered by Franklin, the parent company. Smith said that would
not qualify for an exemption because Franklin already was aware of
Rothschild's condition.
   Kevin Hoffman, Rothschild's attorney, declined to discuss the
case, saying the company would respond in court.
   He did say Rothschild gave severance pay to the workers. But
Smith said the law requires notification regardless.
   In the Drexel case, the class-action suit filed Monday by the
three workers charges Drexel's top managers with breach of contract
and violations of their fiduciary duties because of the plans to
sell the brokerage division.
   The suit, filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan,
contends that the sale of the unit will cost the brokers millions
of dollars because they will be forced to sell their Drexel stock
for far below its true value.
   The price of the stock is based on book value. The suit did not
disclose the firm's book value.
   According to the suit, Drexel has understated the book value of
its assets, including warrants and options it has received in some
deals in lieu of partial payment of fees.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the firm had not studied
the suit and had no comment.
   Drexel annouced plans last week for a major restructuring that
involves the sale of the brokerage unit and the elimination of
about one-third of Drexel's work force. The restructuring was
prompted in part by bad publicity due to the investigation of
securities fraud at the investment house.

   The dollar rose in quiet early European trading
today. Gold prices also were higher.
   Foreign currency dealers said they were waiting for the 8:30
a.m. EDT release of U.S. durable goods orders for March. A rise of
1.5 percent or more could send the dollar higher, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.21 yen to a closing 131.17 following
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's announcement he intends to
resign. Later, in London, it was quoted at 131.35 yen.
   Dealers in Frankfurt said Takeshita's announcement did not
affect European exchange rates because the markets had been
expecting it for a week.
   ``It's very quiet today,'' said Alfred Zapfel, a trader at Bank
of Boston in Frankfurt. ``The dollar isn't doing very much ...
We'll have to wait for durable goods to see if something will
happen.''
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.8658 West German marks, up from 1.8575; 1.6460
Swiss francs, up from 1.6395; 6.3165 French francs, up from 6.2975;
2.0001 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0960; 1.1889 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.1890.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7018, cheaper for buyers
than $1.7050 late Monday.
   Markets were closed in Italy for a national holiday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $385.50 a troy ounce, up
from $384.90 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $385.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $385.50, up from $384.65 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.51 to close at a bid $386.57.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.80 a troy
ounce, down from Monday's $5.81.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rose sharply
today, but the dollar fell against the yen after Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita announced he will resign as soon as Parliament
approves the fiscal 1989 budget.
   The dollar closed at 131.17 yen, down 0.21 yen from Monday's
131.38-yen finish. It opened at 131.65 yen, its high for the day,
and ranged as low as 131.05 yen.
   ``The dollar started higher following its weak note on overseas
markets, where the yen was sold, but Japanese investors concertedly
bought the (yen) following news about Mr. Takeshita's
resignation,'' said an analyst with a commercial bank in Tokyo,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Investors believed that Takeshita's departure would eliminate
some political and economic tensions, he said.
   Takeshita has been linked with a company at the center of a
stock-profiteering and bribery scandal, and opposition parties have
been boycotting budget deliberations in Parliament to demand that
the government clear up the situation.
   ``There has been speculation of some more arrests of
politicians, but the majority expects that things would not
worsen,'' the analyst added.
   Also encouraging yen-buying today were expectations that the
Japanese central bank might raise its interest rate soon.
   Higher domestic interest rates, which would narrow the interest
rate gap between the United States and Japan, would weaken
dollar-buying incentives, traders said.
   Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita told a meeting of branch
chiefs today that the bank would take appropriate measures if
prices become unstable.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which fell 223.89 points Monday, shot up 438.86 points, or
1.34 percent, closing at 33,244.78. The gain was the third-largest
of the year.
   News reports early today that Takeshita might resign boosted
buying, said Kenji Ishizuka of Daiwa Securities.
   ``Since Mr. Takeshita would not resign until the budget is
approved, participants concertedly bought construction issues
because the budget approval guarantees public construction,'' he
added.
   Takeshita announced his decision to resign following a Cabinet
meeting. His popularity has been eroding steadily in the face of
the stock-profiteering and bribery scandal and a new sales tax.
   Besides construction issues, steel shares attracted investors.
Although share prices were higher across the board, trading was
only moderate, with first section volume estimated at 800 million
shares, up from Monday's 450 million.
   Ishizuka said some investors were concerned over domestic
consumer price figures for March, due to be announced later this
week.

<HEAD>A Glance At The Government-Toppling Recruit Scandal</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Japan-Politics Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a glance at the Recruit scandal, which
claimed its biggest victim today when Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita announced his intention to resign:
   THE ORIGIN: In late 1986 Recruit Co. offered bargain-priced
shares in a real estate subsidiary to more than 150 leading
politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives.
The shares doubled in value after they went on public sale,
yielding big profits to the holders who sold.
   Prosecutors, who have arrested 14 people, allege the
transactions were bribes in which Recruit sought special favors
from government bureaucrats in a position to influence or regulate
Recruit's businesses in job-placement magazines or
telecommunications. No politicians have been arrested.
   TAKESHITA'S LINK: Like most other politicians, Takeshita's name
was not on share transactions, but an aide and a relative profited
to a total of $192,000.
   The prime minister also acknowledged that he received more than
$1 million in political donations and contributions to fund-raising
parties from Recruit.
   He told Parliament the donations were legal and sought to put
the matter behind him, but over the weekend he also said he
received a loan of $381,700 from Recruit in 1987 and was
embarrassed at having to change his story.
   ALSO LINKED: Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, under
whose administration the share transactions took place. His aides
reportedly received 29,000 shares and were estimated to have
profited to the tune of $460,000.
   RESIGNATIONS: Three members of Takeshita's Cabinet resigned
because of money links to Recruit. They were Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa, Justice Minister Takashi Hasegawa and Ken Harada,
director general of the Economic Planning Agency.
   ARRESTS: Recruit's founder, Hiromasa Ezoe, faces multiple
charges of bribery along with several executives of the
conglomerate and its subsidiaries. Among others charged with
accepting bribes are Hisashi Shinto, former chairman of Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Japan's giant telecommunications
utility; Kunio Takaishi, former vice minister of education; and
Takashi Kato, a former vice minister of labor.

   Here is a chronology of developments in the Recruit
bribery scandal, which forced Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to
announce his resignation today:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>1986:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Recruit Co., a rapidly growing information and publishing
conglomerate, sells large numbers of unlisted shares in a
subsidiary at low prices to about 160 influential politicians,
businessmen and government officials.
   Oct. 30: The shares are listed on the over-the-counter market,
and quickly rise in value. Many recipients sell their shares,
making large profits.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>1988:</NOTE>

   June 18: First news of the scandal comes when a newspaper
reports that the deputy mayor of a city outside Tokyo received
low-priced Recruit shares in exchange for favors in a building
project.
   June and July: News reports gradually disclose the names of
other officials who received Recruit shares, including aides to
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone.
   Aug. 1: Questioning on the Recruit issue begins in Parliament,
delaying debate over a tax-reform package backed by the governing
Liberal Democratic Party. The package includes an unpopular 3
percent sales tax.
   Sept. 2: The Finance Ministry says the Recruit stock
transactions violated securities laws because they were not
reported to the ministry.
   Sept. 5: Opposition lawmaker Yanosuke Narazaki says a Recruit
official, Hiroshi Matsubara, offered him $38,000 to soft-pedal his
investigation into the scandal.
   Sept. 6: A videotape showing the alleged bribery attempt, filmed
by a TV network at Narazaki's request, is shown on national
television.
   October: The Communist and Socialist parties disclose names of
more politicians who received Recruit shares.
   Oct. 20: Prosecutors take Matsubara into custody _ the first
arrest in the Recruit case.
   Nov. 16: A list of 156 purchasers of Recruit shares is released
in Parliament, but all the names except for 26 politicians and
government officials are deleted.
   Nov. 17: The governing party pushes the tax reform package
through Parliament's lower house despite a boycott by some
opposition parties over the Recruit scandal.
   Dec. 9: Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa resigns after
repeatedly changing his explanation of an aide's stock purchases.
   Dec. 15: Hisashi Shinto, chairman of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, Japan's largest corporation, resigns after acknowledging
that profits from Recruit stock purchases were deposited in his
personal bank account.
   Dec. 30: Justice Minister Takashi Hasegawa resigns 60 hours
after being appointed in a Cabinet reshuffle, after acknowledging
he received donations from Recruit for many years.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>1989:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Jan. 24: Economic Planning Agency chief Ken Harada, who earlier
headed a parliamentary committee investigating the Recruit scandal,
becomes the third Cabinet member to resign because of Recruit links.
   Feb. 11: A severe setback for the ruling party in a
parliamentary by-election is attributed to public unhappiness over
the Recruit scandal and the tax reform package.
   Feb. 13: Recruit founder Hiromasa Ezoe, two NTT officers and
another Recruit official are arrested.
   Feb. 23: The governing party candidate withdraws from a
gubernatorial race because of past donations from Recruit.
   March 7: Former NTT Chairman Shinto is arrested on suspicion of
having provided favors to Recruit in exchange for stock profits.
   March 8: Prosecutors arrest Takashi Kato, former vice minister
of labor.
   March 28: Kunio Takaishi, former vice minister of education,
becomes the 14th person arrested in the scandal.
   March 31: Parliament approves a 50-day provisional budget for
the fiscal year beginning April 1, with opposition parties
boycotting debate over the regular budget to press their demand
that former Prime Minister Nakasone testify on links to Recruit.
   April 11: In an explanation to Parliament of his Recruit ties,
Takeshita says he received more than $1 million in political
donations from the company.
   April 12: Takeshita acknowledges the Recruit donations exceeded
the total amount allowable under law for a company of its size.
   April 16: A poll by Kyodo News Service shows Takeshita's support
rating at only 3.9 percent, an all-time low.
   April 22: News reports disclose that Takeshita received an
additional loan of $381,700 from Recruit.
   April 25: Takeshita announces his resignation.

<TEXT>
   The high-profile Italian retailer Benetton
has opened its first store in Poland, shocking shoppers accustomed
to empty shelves with mounds of colorful clothing and prices in
their own currency.
   Sales clerks reported the most common question was ``Dollars or
zlotys?'' as a storefront on Warsaw's main shopping street, Ulica
Marszalkowska, on Monday turned into a glistening Benetton outlet
with its crisp, modern look.
   The Italian retailer is on the leading edge of marketing by
Western companies in the East bloc. Poland has been trying to
attract such businesses to help shore up its ailing economy.
   Stacks and stacks of knitwear in bright hues of orange, blue,
and yellow were folded on open shelves in the Warsaw store on
Monday. A bevy of saleswomen in Benetton outfits volunteered
assistance.
   In short, the new store at first looked and sounded very unlike
a typically bare Polish store with its clerks' curt replies of
``Nie ma'' _ ``There is none.''
   Within hours of opening, however, the store had acquired the
customary line.
   ``The first day probably will be pretty violent, since it is
something new,'' said saleswoman Elzbieta Makucz.
   Benetton is the first Western clothing retailer to open an
outlet selling for zlotys in Poland, which increasing has a
two-currency economy but is plagued by a shortage of quality
consumer goods.
   Many desirable goods, from cocoa to cars, are bought for dollars
in special shops or by private arrangement.
   Many of Benetton's first shoppers found the zloty prices
astoundingly high. A hot pink sweatshirt was offered for 78,000
zlotys, about the average monthly salary.
   Last month, Poles became able to legally trade dollars for
zlotys at about the same rate _ now 4,000 zlotys per dollar _ as on
the black market.
   Thus, a Pole with $25, perhaps sent by a relative abroad, can
turn it into 100,000 zlotys.
   In a 1988 report, the government estimated that $5 billion in
U.S. currency was circulating in the country and another $2.8
billion was deposited in bank accounts. Many other hard currencies
are, of course, also in circulation.
   In the joint venture with Benetton, the state-run fashion
company Moda Polska is buying merchandise from the Italian retailer
in hard currency and translating the prices to zlotys.
   ``I first of all want to be a businessman,'' said Moda Polska
Director Marek Zembrzuski.
   He said Moda Polska spent about $400,000 for the first Benetton
stock, out of about $5 million to be spent on imported goods this
year. The hard currency is obtained through exports and auctions of
hard currency, he said.
   For Benetton's part, Poland is one of a series of new markets
explored by the company.
   There are nine Benettons in Hungary, five in Czechoslovakia and
seven in East Germany, said Renata Sponchiado, who represents
management in Italy.
   However, the other East bloc Benettons do not accept local
currency, Zembrzuski said.
   Benetton designed the store and trained the staff _ there is
even a company style for folding clothes _ but Moda Polska operates
it.
   ``Moda Polska and Benetton are two young companies, and this is
a good starting point for us,'' said Mrs. Eva Villax, who set up
the Warsaw store for Benetton. She predicted other company outlets
in Poland.
   One man, who was among the first shoppers, left Monday with two
bulging trademark-green shopping bags and an enthusiastic review:
``It is a great idea. There is a much bigger choice.''
   He said the prices seemed about the same as those in stores that
accept dollars.
   However, some women peering at the display window had other
ideas. ``The prices shock me,'' said one. ``It is not even worth
looking,'' said another.

   The year is 2089 and fusion power plants are
energizing the world, bringing the benefits of virtually unlimited
electricity to countries everywhere.
   Earth's sky is crystalline blue, purged of the gases and gunk
that soured the atmosphere above whole continents a century before
when fossil fuels were the main energy of civilization.
   Concerns about the greenhouse effect and problems of acid rain
are now only academic curiosities. An atmosphere once choked with
the combustion gases of fossil fuels is slowly cleaning itself. And
life is returning to lakes and streams that previously were
acid-filled.
   Such is the world that scientists and engineers envision with
the advent of fusion, the process by which atoms are fused together
to release energy.
   Their visions are not just wishful thinking, but goals that must
be achieved, according to some experts, because the age of fossil
fuels is expected to start drawing to a close within only a few
decades. And when fossil fuels are gone or become impractically
expensive, something must be ready to take their place.
   ``The most likely thing will be fusion,'' said Harold P. Furth,
director of the Princeton University plasma physics laboratory.
``The present projections are that by the year 2040 or 2050, there
will be a divergence between the energy required for a growing
population and the energy available from fossil fuels, easily
obtainable uranium and other sources.
   ``There will be quite a calamity unless something new is
ready,'' he added.
   The ``cold fusion'' process announced last month by the
University of Utah is still controversial and unproven. But Furth
and others believe a fusion process based on compressing deuterium
plasma and heating it to 100 million degrees can be developed
within two decades or less.
   Thousands of researchers working at both federal and university
laboratories are moving closer and closer to the point where the
fusion fires will ignite and burn, powered by deuterium or
hydrogen, chemicals easily extracted from seawater.
   Most experts believe the fusion future lies with the
high-pressure ``hot'' process, but they would welcome convincing
proof that Utah's cold, room-temperature fusion works because it
possibly could be developed more quickly.
   Eric Storm, a fusion research project leader at the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory in California, said that researchers could
have a fusion-fired power plant operating by the year 2020 if the
industrial nations of the world would commit the resources.
   ``Fusion is the energy source that nature prefers. It's the one
that drives the sun and the stars,'' said Storm. ``And nature is
efficient.''
   ``We could have fusion in just 15 years or so,'' said Stephen
Dean, president of the Fusion Power Association, a non-profit
education foundation, ``but the government hasn't put a high
priority on it so it will take 30 years or more.''
   Dean said an investment by the federal government of $1 billion
a year for 15 years would bring fusion power to reality, but he
said that isn't likely to happen ``until there's an economic
incentive.''
   Most experts believe there will be a slow phase-out of fossil
fuels as they become more expensive, and that the 21st century
eventually evolve into an all-fusion civilization.
   Some of the fusion of that era will be from manmade plants on
Earth. But the experts also believe there will be a more efficient
use of solar radiation, the energy created by the natural fusion
process of the sun.
   Once that time comes, according to scientists' visions, oil
spills will be obscure footnotes in history texts or just quaint
memories recalled by centenarians who lounge in the bright sunlight
of a pollution-free sky. Petroleum, expensive and becoming rare,
will seldom be used for fuel, and coal even less often.
   A fusion-driven world could have automobiles and trucks running
on nearly silent electric engines, leaving in their wake only
eddies of clean air _ not the rank clouds that trailed vehicles of
an earlier, gasoline-burning age.
   Some engines could operate on hydrogen, a fuel extracted from
seawater by the use of the plentiful electric power.
   In this scenario, fusion power plants, easily licensed and
fueled by a chemical extracted from seawater, would dot the
landscape on continents around the globe.
   The plants would not pose the radiation hazard that once seemed
so threatening from nuclear fission plants of the late 20th
century. There would be no Chernobyl-like monster straining to
break free with fusion.
   Radiation waste from fusion would be only a fraction of that
from fission plants. Fusion wastes are rendered harmless within
decades, while the century-old spent fuel rods from the 1989
nuclear fission power plants would still be deadly and would be for
another 1,000 years.
   ``Whatever process is developed, fusion is inevitable,'' said
Storm, the fusion researcher. ``It's not a question of if, but of
when.''

<HEAD>Clothing Retailer To Sell Larger-Sizes Discount Chain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEG REYNOLDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women's clothing retailer Limited Inc. is
selling its larger-sizes discount chain Lerner Woman, freeing up
the company to concentrate on its higher priced specialty apparel
outlets.
   Lerner Woman, created in 1986 as an offshoot of Lane Bryant,
will be sold for an undisclosed price to a management group led by
the division's president, company spokesman Alfred Dietzel said
Monday.
   Dietzel said the selling price, in cash and securities, was
expected to approximate the book value of Lerner Woman's assets.
   The deal is expected to be completed in June, the company said.
   Lerner Woman, which merged with discount chain Sizes Unlimited
in 1987, operates under the store names Lerner Woman, Sizes
Unlimited, Smart Sizes and Sizes Woman.
   Aimed mostly at discount shoppers seeking larger sizes, the
382-store chain had sales of $223.7 million in 1988.
   Donald Trott, a retail analyst for Dean Witter in New York, said
Monday the deal meant Limited would continue to provide the
Rochelle, N.J.-based Lerner Woman with computer and distribution
services and management information, for a fee.
   ``They don't lose any earnings, and yet through the sale of this
they free up some of their assets,'' Trott said. ``It's a fair deal
all the way around.''
   Columbus-based Limited, with $4 billion in sales last year,
operates more than 3,400 apparel stores nationwide, including The
Limited and Limited Express, Ambercrombie &amp; Fitch, Victoria's
Secret and Henri Bendel.
   Most of the stores _ with the exception of Lerner Woman _ are
full-price outlets that tend to be located in regional shopping
malls, while Lerner Woman stores generally are located in smaller
shopping strips.
   ``Lerner Woman just had never worked,'' said retail analyst Fred
Wintzer of Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore. ``They've got to
find a niche, a customer that isn't being serviced by other chains.
   ``The top management at The Limited just didn't have the time to
concentrate on that division,'' Wintzer said.
   Limited acquired the Sizes Unlimited chain in 1982 and Lane
Bryant in 1986, said a woman at Limited headquarters who declined
to give her name.
   Equity of the new corporation initially will be shared equally
by Lerner Woman's management, led by president Raphael Benaroya,
The Limited and Centre Capital, the company said in a statement.

<HEAD>Dallas On `Short List' For Sears Relocation, Sources Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest
retailer, has narrowed possible relocation sites of its
merchandising group to three or four cities, including Dallas,
sources say.
   The sources said Monday that the Chicago-based retailer now has
a ``short list'' of possible sites, but said Charlotte, N.C., has
emerged as the leading contender. It could not be immediately
determined what other cities were still under consideration, the
Dallas Times Herald reported today.
   Sources told the newspaper that Sears officials are expected to
visit Dallas within the next two weeks to look at the area and meet
with economic development officials.
   ``All of us are operating on feelings, but we believe that we
are definitely on the list,'' said Scott Eubanks, who heads Dallas
Partnership, an economic development agency. ``The big unknown is
Illinois, and I don't want to sell them short.''
   Chicago-area officials have been working to keep Sears in the
city where it grew up since the company announced in October it
wanted to build a campus-style headquarters complex for its
merchandising group. That division now has headquarters in the
110-story Sears Tower in downtown Chicago. At the time, the company
said it would look at other cities but preferred to stay in the
area.
   Though Sears is selling the 15-year-old tower, the company has
said its corporate headquarters will remain there after the
merchandise group is gone. Even so, the move would involve 6,700 of
the group's 8,000 employees.
   Eubanks said he expects the company to make a decision within
the next few weeks. ``I think it's real close,'' he said.
   A Sears spokeswoman said the company has not set a deadline for
its decision and that she could not comment on the relocation.
   Other cities under consideration, sources say, include Denver,
Kansas City, Mo., Atlanta; and Pittsburgh.
   Economic development officials in North Carolina would not
comment Monday on Sears. ``I've got nothing to say,'' said Alvah
Ward, director of business and industry development for the state's
Department of Commerce.
   Dallas has attracted GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn., to relocate
its consolidated Telephone Operation to Las Colinas in suburban
Irving and J.C. Penney, the nation's fourth-largest retailer, to
move from New York City to suburban Plano.
   The GTE relocation means 1,000 new jobs in the area and the
Penney is bringing another 3,000 jobs.
   Sears' merchandise group, which oversees the retailer's stores
and catalog operations, accounts for more than half of the
company's size. Sears also owns Allstate Insurance, Dean Witter
Financial Services and Coldwell Banker Real Estate, none of which
is being relocated.

   Linked to an influence-peddling scandal and
immensely unpopular, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita announced his
resignation today but left his successor and the timing of his
departure unclear.
   The Recruit scandal has bedeviled Japanese politics for half of
Takeshita's 18-month tenure, and it appeared possible an elder
politician might become interim prime minister until the situation
is sorted out.
   The candidate mentioned in many news reports was former Foreign
Minister Masayoshi Ito, an elder statesman untouched by the Recruit
scandal. But his health was in question _ he is a diabetic.
   ``I think it should be a young person. It's time for a young
person to be in charge,'' said Ito, 75-year-old chairman of the
executive council of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   Other powerful figures in the party that has governed Japan
since 1955 are as tainted by money from the Recruit Co. as
Takeshita, including his rival and party secretary general, former
Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe.
   ``The Recruit question has caused a grave crisis for the
nation's parliamentary democracy,'' Takeshita, 65, said in a
nationwide television broadcast after telling the Cabinet of his
intention to resign.
   ``I have decided to pull out in order to retrieve the public's
trust in politics,'' he said. ``As the chief executive of
government and president of the ruling party, I deeply apologize.''
   Asked about the succession, he declined to comment, saying ``it
is not the place of one resigning to express such opinions.''
   Once Takeshita resigns, governing party members would choose
their next party president, who would become prime minister due to
the Liberal Democrats' majority in both houses of parliament.
   His resignation would also mean his entire Cabinet would leave
office. The party leadership also would be expected to resign, news
reports said.
   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged after the
announcement. The Nikkei Stock Average rose 1.34 percent, the
year's third largest one-day gain.
   Newspapers rushed out single-sheet extra editions with the news.
The tabloid Fuji daily headlined ``Takeshita Finally Resigns.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle said today the Bush administration
would work with Takeshita's eventual successor. ``It's a democracy
and whoever the leader of that democracy is, we'll work with,''
Quayle said during a stop in Honolulu en route to American Samoa
and Australia.
   Takeshita's approval rating in a recent poll by Kyodo News
Service slumped to 3.9 percent, making him Japan's most unpopular
postwar prime minister.
   In addition to the scandal, he was hurt by the introduction
April 1 of an unpopular 3 percent sales tax. And rural voters _ a
bastion of Liberal Democratic strength _ were disaffected by moves
to liberalize agricultural imports.
   Takeshita said he would leave office after parliament passes the
1989 budget. But parliament, or the Diet, has been stalled by a
boycott by opposition parties demanding that former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone testify about the Recruit scandal.
   There was a hint of progress on the issue this evening as the
governing party said the opposition had agreed to participate in
Budget Committee sessions. But the opposition still insisted on a
promise that Nakasone would testify.
   The Liberal Democrats have more than enough votes to ram the
budget through, but doing so would go against the Japanese
tradition of politics by consensus.
   Takako Doi, head of the Japan Socialist Party, the largest
opposition group, said she wants new general elections and
Nakasone's testimony. ``I think it is nonsense to ask for the
passage of the budget in exchange for his (Takeshita's)
resignation,'' she said.
   Takeshita said he would go ahead with a nine-day trip to five
Southeast Asian nations starting Saturday, indicating he hopes the
Diet will pass the budget in early May.
   Takeshita had been clinging to office with a pledge to reform
politics and reclaim public trust in politicians.
   Recently, however, he acknowledged he received even more money
from the Recruit Co. than the more than $1 million in what he
called legal political donations that he earlier this month
admitted getting.
   During the weekend it was reported Takeshita he also received a
loan of $381,700 from the information-publishing giant in 1987.
Admitting the reports were true further embarrassed Takeshita.
   The Recruit scandal broke last summer with revelations that the
company had sold cut-price shares in a real estate subsidiary to
more than 150 politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media
executives.
   The shares, often bought with money lent by another Recruit
subsidiary, yielded fat profits when sold after the subsidiary went
public in 1986.
   Takeshita, through an aide and a relative who actually held the
shares, benefited to the tune of $192,000. Nakasone's aides
similarly raked in about $460,000.
   Three Cabinet ministers had resigned previously because of links
to Recruit. Prosecutors have so far arrested 14 people _ but no
politicians _ in the case, charging them with bribery and
securities law violations.
   It is alleged that Recruit sought favors from bureaucrats who
regulated its main business in job-placement magazines and from top
executives of companies with which it did business, including
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
   Although Japan has been known for money politics since the end
of the war, the public was shocked by the amounts of money involved
and the broad spectrum of the establishment that was tainted.
   The Recruit scandal has caused the greatest political fallout in
Japan since former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was accused in the
Lockheed affair in 1976. He was convicted of taking a $2 million
bribe after the U.S. aircraft company admitted it spent $12.1
million to advance its sales in Japan.

   The cost of wages, salaries and benefits to
the nation's employers rose 1.2 percent in the first quarter of
1989, with increases in benefits costs again outpacing pay gains,
the Labor Department reported today.
   The Employment Cost Index report showed that for the 12 months
ended March 31 the cost of wages, salaries and benefits rose 4.8
percent, down slightly from the 5 percent average for calendar 1988
but up significantly from the 1987 jump of 3.6 percent.
   The index measures changes in an employers' costs for all forms
of compensation, principally wages and salaries and employer-paid
benefits such as health insurance. It is closely watched as a
barometer of inflation, particularly in the past year as analysts
have speculated that the tight labor market would drive up
compensation costs because of increased competition for workers.
   Analysts disagreed over whether the figures signaled a faster
pace of wage gains and therefore increased inflationary pressure on
the economy.
   ``The numbers are reasonably favorable and there are no signs of
wage acceleration,'' said Michael Evans, president of a Washington
economic forecasting firm. ``Except for the one sore spot of rising
health care costs ... I think the figures show wage gains continue
to be stable and no signs of rapid acceleration.''
   But economist Roger Brinner at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., said the report indicated labor costs are ``creeping up.''
He predicted the annual rate of employer cost increases, which
would be 4.5 percent if the first-quarter numbers held throughout
the year, would climb to 5 percent and possibly to 5.5 percent over
the next year.
   ``With unemployment down to almost 5 percent, workers feel that
they can ask for their normal share _ which is the sum of inflation
and productivity,'' Brinner said in a telephone interview.
Inflation on U.S.-produced goods is about 4.5 percent and
productivity gains have been in the 1 percent to 1.5 percent range.
   The rate of employer costs could slow, however, if unemployment
rises. Brinner predicted that the civilian jobless rate, 5.0
percent last month, would edge up in the next quarter and reach 5.5
percent or slightly higher by year's end.
   The 1.2 percent increase in the index for the first quarter
compared with 1.0 percent in the final quarter of 1988 and 1.4
percent from the first quarter of last year, the Labor Department
reported.
   The increase for the first three months of 1989 was attributed
to a 1.1 percent jump in wage and salary costs and a 1.8 percent
rise in employers' costs for benefits. Escalating health care costs
have been the largest factor in the rising costs of benefits.
   For the year ended March 31, the government said wages and
salaries for workers in private industry rose 4.2 percent while the
cost of benefits rose 5.1 percent.
   Employer costs for workers in service industries rose 1.5
percent in the first quarter, up from 1.2 percent in the final
three months of 1988 and the 1.3 percent gain reported in the first
quarter of 1988.
   In the goods-producing industries, employer costs rose 1.0
percent for the quarter, up from 0.8 percent in the final quarter
of 1988 but down from the 1.8 percent jump reported for the first
quarter of last year.

<HEAD>Are Incentives Working Or A Dud? Today's Figures Should Tell</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 15th graf pvs, `Meantime, Ward's ...' with 4 grafs to UPDATE
with GM second-quarter production cuts.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Today brings another critical test for the auto
industry _ the first full sales period of the latest round of
incentives _ and carmakers are looking for the consumer response
that so far has eluded them.
   ``I'm holding my breath a little on this one,'' auto analyst
Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. of New York said Monday.
   Sales during March were lower than expected, prompting General
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. to institute new,
expensive incentive programs. Partially because of those
enticements, car and light truck sales during early April were 28.3
percent higher than the same period last year.
   But sales during the first 10 days of April last year were among
the lowest of the year, distorting comparisons with this year's
performance.
   Sales rebounded in mid-April 1988, meaning today's year-to-year
comparisons will give a better snapshot of how sales are faring
compared to the same time in the second-best sales year in industry
history.
   Automakers had counted on strong March and April sales to shrink
inventories and put off the need for large-scale production
cutbacks.
   ``I guess you'd say they (incentives) are working but not as
well as they used to,'' analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. said Monday. ``If that's so, mid-April sales were
better than the March rate but not as good as early April.''
   Laughlin said he was watching interest rates particularly
closely.
   ``If interest rates start to trend down, I think that would
alleviate some of the concern (among automakers) about the impact
of this particular (incentive) program, '' he said. ``It would
suggest that things will be easier in the next few months.
   ``If interest rates hang up here, it may be a source of concern
for the industry.''
   One of the first places any industry concern would be noted is
in the companies' production schedules. GM, Ford and Chrysler held
to ambitious production levels through the first quarter of this
year, leading some analysts to speculate that production rates
would have to be changed later this year, especially at
model-changeover time in the third quarter.
   Today, Ford analyst Ray Windecker said the nation's No. 2
automaker was cutting about 2 percent from its second-quarter
production schedule as part of ``fine tuning.''
   ``Our market share continues to move up, but we will cheerfully
admit the industry is a little softer than we thought it would
be,'' he said. The cuts, Windecker added, would come in overtime
Ford has been running at all but one of its 18 U.S. and Canadian
assembly plants. The company's Oakville, Ontario, plant, which
makes the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz, is operating on straight
time.
   Windecker said third-quarter production schedules are due out
later.
   Meantime, Ward's Automotive Reports, a weekly industry
newsletter, said in Monday editions that GM had cut its production
schedule by 60,000 cars for the third quarter of 1989.
   GM spokesman Tom Pyden refused to comment on the report, saying
final production figures for the July-September period aren't set.
However, he confirmed the nation's largest carmaker had cut its
second-quarter production schedule by about 3 percent.
   ``The vast majority of it is elimination of some of our planned
overtime,'' he said. ``This does not change our yearlong sales
forecast for 1989. We will approach 15 million units.''
   Chrysler's original production schedule for mid-1989 was scaled
back from first-quarter levels.

<HEAD>Bush Renews Plea for Cut in Capital Gains Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said today that critics
``couldn't be more wrong'' when they call his proposed cut in
capital gains taxes ``a tax break for the rich.''
   Rather, he said, that proposal and other new investment
incentives are needed to help America compete in the global economy.
   Bush took note of the criticism of his proposal in Congress and
elsewhere in a speech prepared for managers and employees at Ford
Aerospace's Space Systems Division here.
   ``Well, they couldn't be more wrong,'' he said. ``Lower capital
gains taxes will create jobs for those who don't have jobs, and
help build a better America.''
   Capital gains taxes are levied on the profits that businesses
and individuals make on investments. The president wants to cut the
33 percent maximum tax on capital gains to 15 percent and to exempt
entirely the gains accrued by people with incomes under $10,000 a
year.
   When fully effective in 1995, the tax break for capital gains
would apply to assets held for 36 months or longer.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and other top
congressional Democrats have criticized Bush for pushing the
capital-gains reduction, which they term ``a tax break for the
rich,'' while opposing legislation to increase the minimum wage to
$4.55 an hour from the current $3.35.
   In his Palo Alto speech, Bush also put in a fresh plug for his
proposed tax credit aimed at making child care more affordable for
the poor.
   This came a day after it was disclosed that he had come out
against a reduction in the surtax paid by older Americans for
Medicare coverage of catastrophic illiness.
   The president noted that demographic changes in the American
labor force indicate that the majority of new job-seekers in the
years ahead will be females, minorities and immigrants.
   To keep abreast of the rapidly changing technologies and the
change in the labor markets, he said, businesses must have
incentives to make the kinds of investments that will create new
jobs _ and he suggested that many of these new jobs will come in
the high-technology area.
   ``Lower capital gains taxes will create jobs for those who don't
have jobs, and help build a better America,'' he said. ``So let us
act to lift revenue, help savings, and free American businesses,
without distorting world markets.''
   ``My friends, I want to give the high five to high-tech. And I
want to do it by investing in competitiveness,'' he said.
   The president was coupling his Northern California economic
speech today with a pep talk downstate to officers at a
narcotics-enforcement training institute in Rancho del Rio.
   The disparate themes of the four-day Bush trip, which will
conclude Thursday in Florida, seemed aimed at projecting an active
president in the final seven days of the first 100 _ a milestone
that has been used to report first impressions of the president's
stewardship of national affairs.
   Bush has sought to minimize the importance of the 100-day marker
for presidential performance. But during a speech Monday to the
annual luncheon of Associated Press newspaper publishers in
Chicago, he went ahead anyway.
   ``We've made a good start these first three months,'' Bush said.
``So while I'm pleased with all we've accomplished in these three
months, there's a long road ahead of us.''
   Meanwhile, in a letter made public Monday, the president came
out against any quick moves to reduce the surtax for Medicare
coverage of catastrophic illness.
   In the letter, released by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., Bush
said it would be ``imprudent to tinker'' with the program even in
light of a congressionally projected surplus in its reserves.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, last week raised the possibility of a reduction of up to
16 percent in the surtax.
   Bush, however, said in the letter that financial reserves for
the program ``are not excessive'' and may actually be ``too thin.''
He said the surplus projections are based on uncertainties in a
program that is only a few months old.
   The president set aside the Ford Aerospace plant speech today to
laud the more than 75-month recovery from the 1981-82 recession and
the nation's 5 percent unemployment rate, which is at the lowest
level in 15 years. But Bush also wanted to warn anew of an America
that is declining competitively in the global economy.
   The merchandise trade deficit fell from $152.1 billion in 1987
to $118.7 billion last year _ a 22 percent reduction which
represented the first annual improvement since 1980.
   But the deficit has been on an upward trend more recently, with
the red-ink figure at $10.5 billion in February, which was more
than 20 percent above the January figure.
   ``We had a tremendous improvement in the trade figure last year,
but we're now seeing a pause,'' said Michael Boskin, chairman of
the president's Council of Economic Advisers. ``When you go through
a very substantial growth in exports, as we did last year, you
often see such a pause and an adjustment.''
   Speaking to reporters en route here on Air Force One, Boskin
said that many businesses and industries are still trying to build
up to capacity production.
   Bush will travel to Los Angeles on Wednesday to be reunited with
the president he served as vice president for eight years, Ronald
Reagan.
   Later in the week, the president will address the Texas
Legislature in Austin and make drug-related appearances in Miami
and Clearwater, Fla., before returning to Washington late Thursday.

   High school students walked out of class
and rallied today in support of miners on strike against Pittston
Coal Group, a day after the walkout turned nasty with the arrests
of at least 200 miners.
   Seven striking members of the United Mine Workers said they were
injured in Monday's arrests. Many strikers accused Virginia state
troopers of being unnecessarily rough.
   Most of the town's businesses closed for Monday's daylong rally
in support of the strike, now in its 20th day.
   ``It's not criminal to stand up for what you believe in,'' Marty
Hudson, executive assistant to the union vice president, told about
300 people at the rally in this western Virginia town of about
1,400 people. ``There's going to be a lot more people in jail
because it ain't over.''
   State Police Sgt. B.I. Sparks said about 200 miners and their
supporters were arrested and charged with obstructing a free
passage, Route 773, and were being released on their recognizance.
   Union members estimated the number arrested at closer to 300. An
exact count was not immediately available because the numbers
overwhelmed local officials, forcing them to turn a courtroom into
an impromptu holding cell.
   ``There's not enough cells to hold us,'' Hudson said.
   The 1,400 Pittston employees in Virginia and 300 in West
Virginia went on strike April 5, accusing the company of unfair
practices during contract talks. The miners had been working
without a contract since February 1988.
   About 200 union members gathered today at the McClure mine but
did not block the road or mine entrances. No one was arrested.
   However, ``I think all of them here were prepared to go to jail
if necessary,'' UMW District 28 President Jackie Stump said today.
   Also, about 150 Clintwood High School students walked out of
class today and rallied at the Dickenson County Courthouse in
support of the miners, officials said.
   ``They're sort of walking around in the street in front of the
courthouse,'' waving signs and chanting, said deputy county clerk
Lula Large. She said a single police officer watched the students
for a while, then left.
   ``The principal came down and talked to the children and asked
them to go back to class,'' but the students refused, Large said.
   A secretary at Clintwood High said she was instructed to tell
callers that school officials had no comment.
   Monday's arrests capped a day of civil disobedience by the
union, which used more than 1,000 members to block entrances to
Pittston's Moss No. 3 preparation plant and 200 others to block the
Lambert Fork mine, both in Russell County, in addition to the
McClure mine.
   Also Monday, the union expanded its strike against Pittston to
temporarily include Westmoreland Coal Co., which it accused of
plotting to provide Pittston with 200,000 to 300,000 tons of coal
to fulfill contracts. Westmoreland has denied that charge.
   The Pittston employees on strike in Virginia were joined on the
picket lines by about 750 Westmoreland employees who are taking off
three of the 10 ``memorial days'' _ or personal days _ allowed by
their contract.
   State police treatment of those arrested infuriated some union
members and supporters, some of whom displayed signs that said
``Welcome To Poland'' and ``Cut State Police Pay and Benefits.''
   Sparks said he was aware of some reports of injuries. ``They
were just complaints of injuries,'' he said. ``We don't know
whether there were actually injuries.''
   Six miners who said they received cuts and bruises while being
arrested were treated and released at Dickenson County Medical
Center in Clintwood. A seventh was admitted with reports of blurred
vision, and was held for observation.
   Pittston Coal Group President Michael Odom and company
spokeswoman Susan Copeland did not return phone calls from The
Associated Press on Monday.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Lower On Forecasts For More Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade on forecasts for
more rain in key crop-growing areas during the next week to 10 days.
   ``There's more agreement right now than there's been,'' said
John Frazier, a grain-market analyst in Chicago with Balfour
Maclaine Corp., referring to the wide disparity in forecasts last
week.
   The National Weather Service predicted normal temperatures and
normal rainfall for the Corn Belt in a six-to-10-day forecast
issued late Monday.
   Meteorologists also predicted increased precipitation in the
Great Plains, where the winter wheat crop has been severely damaged
by dry weather.
   Early declines in the wheat market are also linked to reports
that the Agriculture Department rejected Egypt's bid for 300,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents lower to \ cent higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $4.14{ per bushel; corn was 1\
cents to 3 cents lower with May at $2.67\ per bushel; oats were 1\
cents to 2{ cents lower with May at $1.94{ per bushel; soybeans
were 7{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with July at $7.45 per bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower, while pork futures were mixed during
early trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent to .62 cent lower with June at 70.15
cents per pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .55 cent lower with
May at 75.65 cents per pound; live hogs were .13 cent lower to .35

<HEAD>Court Rules States May Tax for Oil and Gas Taken from Indian Reservations</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 22-26, In other action, with other cases.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that states may
tax companies for oil and gas taken from Indian reservations.
   Voting 6-3, the justices handed Western states an important
victory in upholding a New Mexico tax on oil and gas taken from the
Jicarilla Apache reservation there.
   The court said the state levy does not trample on Indian rights
and is not unfair to a petroleum company _ even though the company
must pay taxes to the state and the tribe.
   The court rejected arguments that the state tax interferes with
tribal economic development by prompting producers to look off
Indian reservations for mineral deposits.
   New Mexico officials told the court the dispute is of great
concern in the West. They said there are more than 150 cases of
companies with deposits on Indian land protesting such double
taxation in Arizona, New Mexico, Montana and Utah.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said Congress
has not specifically pre-empted the power of states to tax oil and
gas on Indian lands.
   ``Any impairment to the federal policy favoring the exploitation
of on-reservation oil and gas resources by Indian tribes ... is
simply too indirect and too insubstantial to support'' a claim the
state tax is pre-empted, Stevens said.
   Stevens rejected arguments by Cotton Petroleum Inc., which has a
lease with the Apaches for oil and gas on the reservation, that it
is subject to unfair double taxation.
   ``It is, of course, true that the total taxes paid by Cotton are
higher than those paid by off-reservation producers,'' he said.
``But neither the state nor the tribe imposes a discriminatory tax.
The burdensome consequence is entirely attributable to the fact
that the leases are located in an area where two governmental
entities share jurisdiction.''
   Stevens also noted that New Mexico provides services to Cotton
Petroleum on the reservation.
   There is no constitutional requirement that the services the
company receives be equal in value to the amount of taxes it pays,
Stevens added.
   The Constitution does not demand that ``benefits received from a
tax authority by an ordinary commercial taxpayer ... must equal the
amount of its tax obligations,'' he said.
   Finally, Stevens rejected an assertion that the Apache tribe is
a ``state'' and therefore Cotton Petroleum is subject to multiple
state taxation.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said New
Mexico is increasing its revenue ``at the expense of tribal
economic development.'' That violates federal policy, expressed in
laws and regulations, to protect Indian self-determination, he said.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall.
   Cotton Petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some
15,000 acres of land on the Jicarilla Apache reservation.
   The company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percent
of its prpoduction, and New Mexico levies five taxes on the company
amounting to 8 percent of its production.
   Cotton Petroleum noted that oil and gas producers in the state
with deposits taken from non-Indian land only pay 8 percent in
royalties.
   The company said it paid $2.3 million in taxes to New Mexico
from 1981 through 1985 but received only $89,000 in services from
the state.
   Today's ruling upholds a 1987 decision by the New Mexico Court
of Appeals.
   The Jicarilla tribe was not a direct participant in the case. It
filed a so-called friend-of-the-court brief expressing its
opposition to the state tax.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Upheld a 1986 federal law imposing ``safety user fees'' on
pipeline companies that transport natural gas and hazardous liquids.
   The court reversed the ruling of a federal magistrate in
Oklahoma that the law, which allows the secretary of transportation
to impose user fees to pay for pipeline safety programs,
unconstitutionally gives the executive branch too much of Congress'
power to impose taxes.
   _ Tossed out a dispute over the federal government's power to
ban newspapers from publishing lists of winners in privately run
lotteries.
   The justices ruled 6-3 that a controversy from Minnesota has
become moot because the government no longer intends to enforce the
ban.
   The Indian reservations case is Cotton Petroleum vs. New Mexico,
87-1327.

possibly exercised in 1994 and 1995.
   The latest transaction brings USAir's total Boeing 737 orders to
68 aircraft, which will be delivered between now and 1992, plus 96
options, which would be delivered between 1992 and 1995.
   USAir, the nation's ninth-largest airline, plans to complete its
acquisition of Piedmont Aviation Inc. in August. USAir took
delivery of its first 737-300 in late 1984. It currently operates a
fleet of 56 737-300s.
   USAir also has ordered 20 Dutch Fokker 100 jets and holds
options on 20 more. First delivery is scheduled for June 1989.
USAir also recently signed a letter of intent with McDonnell
Douglas Corp. to purchase as many as 40 MD-82 aircraft.

<HEAD>Britain's Ranks Hovis Launches Bid For Australian Food Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ranks Hovis McDougall PLC has made a takeover bid
of about 1.4 billion pounds for Goodman Fielder Wattie Ltd., the
Australian food concern that failed in its hostile attempt to
acquire Ranks Hovis last year.
   Turning the tables on the Sydney-based company, the British food
group emphasized Monday its bid did not stem from last year's
takeover battle or from fears it might be revived.
   Ranks Hovis characterized its proposal, which values the
Australian company at the equivalent of about $2.4 billion, as part
of its own plan to expand internationally. Goodman Fielder is the
largest food company in Australia and New Zealand.
   Goodman Fielder said it wasn't informed of the takeover bid in
advance and advised shareholders to keep their shares while its
directors examine Ranks Hovis' proposal.
   There was mixed speculation on what Goodman Fielder would do.
Several analysts said they consider Ranks Hovis' offer fair and one
analyst speculated that Goodman Fielder would welcome it.
   Goodman Fielder's corporate affairs director, Greg Russell, said
``Clearly there are synergies between the two companies.''
   This same point was made last year by the Australian company
when it was pursuing Ranks Hovis.
   John Elston, an analyst with James Capel &amp; Co., said Goodman
Fielder could block the British bid if it chose to because a large
portion of its shareholders are loyal to current management.
   ``In practical terms, you either have an agreed deal or you
don't have a deal at all,'' Elston said.
   Goodman Fielder's attempted takeover of Ranks Hovis last year
was thwarted by Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission because
of its dependence on debt and on possible anti-competitive grounds.
   The attempt left Goodman Fielder with 29.9 percent of Ranks
Hovis' shares. A Goodman Fielder official said the company has held
discussions with several interested parties about selling the stake
but the talks are on hold while Goodman Fielder considers the Ranks
Hovis proposal.
   Ranks Hovis said its bid is contingent upon acquiring more than
50 percent of Goodman Fielder's common stock. The British company
also said its offer carries a condition that Goodman Fielder not
enter into any new financial obligations exceeding a certain
monetary threshold.
   The transaction would have to be endorsed by Ranks Hovis
shareholders and would be subject to review by government
regulators. Ranks Hovis said it did not anticipate any problems
with Australian authorities.
   Besides Britain, Ranks Hovis has interests in Australia, New
Zealand, Asia, Europe and the United States. It makes bread, flour,
cakes and a wide range of other food products.
   Goodman Fielder holds about 35 percent of the Australian
flour-milling market and has a 50 percent share of that market in
New Zealand. It controls 60 percent of the Australian margirine and
cooking oil market is the third largest gelatin maker in the world.
It also owns Meneba NV, a Dutch flour, bakery and poultry company.

<HEAD>Goldome Reports $38.8 Million Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goldome bank, one of the nation's leading
thrifts, reported a loss of $38.8 million, or $1.41 per share, for
its first quarter ending March 31, company officials said today.
   Goldome lost $12 million or 45 cents per share during the same
period last year.
   Chief Executive Officer Ross Kenzie told shareholders at the
company's annual meeting in Buffalo that the loss _ which follows a
loss of $119 million in 1988 _ was due to continued high interest
rates and a decrease in income from non-banking subsidiaries.
   Kenzie, who is retiring this summer, said the company would
continue restructuring efforts under the leadership of Thomas
Cooper, the former head of the Bank of America who was recently
named his successor.
   ``I have no doubt this company will triumph in the 1990s,''
Kenzie said before turning the meeting over to Cooper.
   Goldome, with assets of $14.5 billion, has operations in two
dozen states.

<HEAD>Quaker Oats' Quarterly Profit Down 9 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quaker Oats Co. today reported a 9.2 percent drop
in its third-quarter earnings, citing an extraordinary expense of
$20.7 million stemming from the consolidation of its European
food-manufacturing operations.
   Quaker reported net income of $68.1 million, or 85 cents a
share, for the three months ending March 31, compared with $75
million, or 94 cents a share, for the same period in 1988.
   Revenues for the quarter totaled $1.38 billion, a 3 percent gain
from last year's sales of $1.34 billion, the Chicago-based company
said in a news release.
   Excluding the one-time charge of $20.7 million, operating income
would have been $158.4 million, 5 percent above a year ago, the
company said.
   Chairman William D. Smithburg said the results reflected a
continued strong performance by Gatorade thirst quencher and
Quaker's domestic cereal business, which more than offset lower
results from the company's Pet Foods and Fisher-Price toys
subsidiaries.
   For the first nine months of fiscal 1989, Quaker reported $158.2
million, or $1.99 per share, compared with $161.6 million, or $2.02
per share, for the first nine months of fiscal 1988.
   Revenues for the first nine months totaled $4.16 billion,
compared with $3.84 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>Zenith Posts $4 Million Loss for Quarter, But Expects Profitable
Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp. on Tuesday
reported a $4 million loss in the first quarter due in part to
higher supply costs, but the maker of televisions and computers
said it still expects to turn a profit this year.
   The net loss of $4 million, a deficit of 15 cents a share, for
the three months ending April 1 compares with net income of
$400,000, or 1 cent a share, for the same period in 1988.
   First-quarter sales totaled $674.5 million, a 17 percent gain
from $574.1 million in the first quarter of 1988, Zenith said in a
news release from its headquarters in this north Chicago suburb.
   ``Our first-quarter loss was anticipated in our 1989 plan; we
still expect profit improvement for the full year,'' said Zenith
Chairman Jerry Pearlman.
   Zenith, the only major U.S.-based television manufacturer,
recorded its first annual profit in four years in 1988, mainly as a
result of booming computer sales.
   Sales of Zenith computer systems and components rose 15 percent
in the first quarter, to $402 million, but the group's operating
income declined due to higher prices for memory chips, lower sales
of power supplies and a $3 million loss in foreign exchange.
   Memory-chip costs are expected to drop significantly and sales
of power supplies are expected to double in the second quarter,
Zenith said.
   Sales of Zenith picture tubes, televisions and video-cassette
recorders rose 21 percent, to $272 million, in the first quarter.
   The consumer electronics group's operating income also improved,
Zenith said, although television price tags industrywide were below
year-ago levels.
   Zenith said it put through modest price increases for its
consumer electronics products early in the first quarter, and those
increases have been holding.

   Sales of cars and light trucks made by the
nation's Big Three automakers rose 4.7 percent in mid-April
compared with last year, mainly because of a strong performance by
Ford Motor Co., the companies said Tuesday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford and Chrysler Corp. reported their
vehicles sold at an average daily rate of 38,686 during the April
11-20 period this year, compared with a rate of 36,956 cars and
trucks a day during the same time last year.
   Car sales rose a modest 2.1 percent and truck sales were up 9.3
percent during the period, in which each of the Big Three had new
incentive packages in full force.
   The companies have been banking that incentives announced at the
end of March and in early April would entice customers into
showrooms and help pull the industry out of a lower-than-expected
sales slump during the first three months of the year.
   Normally, March and April sales are robust, but they failed to
live up to that billing last month, hence the incentives.
   For the first 20 days of April, Big Three car sales were up 12.1
percent and truck sales were running 15.6 percent ahead of last
year's pace. Since Jan. 1, car sales by the Big Three were down 8.4
percent and truck sales were off 1.2 percent compared with last
year.
   Ford said its mid-April car sales were running 14.5 percent
ahead of last year's pace, going to a daily rate of 8,348 this year
from 7,292 during the period last year. So far in 1989, Ford's car
sales were running 1.1 percent ahead of last year's pace.
   Truck sales by Ford were up 4.9 percent during the 10-day period
this year, and were down 2.4 percent for the calendar year.
   GM reported a 1.5 percent decrease in its mid-April car sales,
with a daily rate of 12,296 this year, compared with 12,483 last
year. So far this year, GM has sold 11 percent fewer cars than last
year.
   GM's light truck sales were up 14.7 percent in mid-April and
down 2.4 percent so far this year.
   Chrysler said its average daily car sales rate fell to 3,374
during mid-April this year, a 10.3 percent decline from the 3,760
rate during the period last year. Car sales by the nation's No. 3
automaker for the year were running 18.2 percent behind last year's
pace.
   Truck sales by Chrysler during the period were 7.1 percent above
the mid-April pace last year, and for the entire year were 2.6
percent ahead of last year.

   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
durable goods posted a moderate gain in March, the government
reported Tuesday, but analysts said the increase reflected a surge
in aircraft orders that masked a broader slowdown in the economy.
   The Commerce Department said total orders for durable goods rose
0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $124.9 billion last month,
with virtually all of the increase attributed to a jump in demand
for transportation equipment.
   Excluding the transportation category, which is subject to wide
swings depending on when big contracts are signed, orders were down
2.8 percent in March, the third straight monthly decline.
   Analysts said the figures were consistent with recent government
reports which suggest that economic growth is slowing as the record
peacetime expansion extends into its seventh year.
   ``This definitely should tell even the biggest skeptic that the
slowdown's arrived,'' Maury Harris, chief economist for PaineWebber
Inc., said of the latest report. ``Anybody who says monetary policy
hasn't affected the economy is just crazy.''
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up
interest rates in an effort to slow the economy and thus restrain
inflation, although some analysts have expressed concern that the
Fed's actions could unintentionally topple the country into a
recession.
   Economist Priscilla Trumbull of the Wefa Group in Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., said the Fed still should be able to engineer a ``soft
landing'' in which growth slows enough to cool inflation without
causing an economic downturn.
   Ms. Trumbull said the weakness in manufacturing orders ``is
probably one of the best things that could happen for the economy''
because it reduces concern that factories will overheat and face
shortages that would drive up prices.
   In March, transportation orders rose 10.4 percent while most
other industry categories posted declines. The jump in the
transportation sector reflected a large boost in orders for
aircraft and parts that more than offset a decline in demand for
motor vehicles.
   Harris said the surge in orders for planes would have little
immediate impact on the economy, since the aircraft manufacturing
industry already has a large backlog of unfilled orders.
   In the defense category, which overlaps with the transportation
sector and also is subject to wide swings, orders surged 29.1
percent in March after rising 19.7 percent in February and falling
34.5 percent in January.
   Excluding defense, all other orders were down 1.2 percent in
March, the third straight monthly decline.
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a
good indicator of business expansion plans, orders rose 2.9 percent
last month to $38.1 billion after dropping 8.3 percent in February.
   In other categories, orders for primary metals such as steel
were down 3.8 percent, demand for non-electrical machinery rose 1.4
percent and orders for electrical machinery dropped 6.7 percent.
   Shipments of durable goods were down 0.7 percent in March to a
seasonally adjusted $120.1 billion, the third straight monthly
decline.

   Soybean futures prices fell sharply for the
second consecutive session Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as
scattered rainfall in the Midwest cooled drought fears.
   Wheat futures finished nearly unchanged.
   Overnight rain in the western Corn Belt and forecasts for more
rain over the next few days prompted moderate to heavy selling of
soybean, corn and oat futures contracts from the opening bell.
   The National Weather Service issued a six-to-10-day forecast
late Monday that predicted normal temperatures and normal rainfall
in the region early next week.
   ``It's a weather market,'' said John Frazier, a grain-market
analyst in Chicago with Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   The Agriculture Department reported that corn planting got under
way in most major producing areas last week. Soybean planting will
begin in early May.
   But the USDA also said the Kansas winter wheat crop was in
mostly very poor to poor condition last week due to a lack of
moisture. That report helped support the wheat market.
   At the close, wheat was } cent lower to } cent higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.15 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents

<HEAD>USAir Orders Boeing Jets With Potential Value Of $1.7 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USAir Inc. has ordered 18 Boeing 737 jetliners
and taken options on 36 more in a deal with a potential value of
about $1.7 billion, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Co. said Tuesday.
   The announcement was the latest indication that the aerospace
giant is continuing on a roll of large aircraft orders. It came
just one day after Boeing's annual shareholders meeting, at which
the plane manufacturer announced increased dividends and a stock
split, and predicted record-breaking sales this year.
   Boeing considers a plane sold when it is delivered to the buyer.
   The USAir order includes flexibility for the airline to decide
later whether it wants jets in the 737-300, -400 or -500 series.
The -500 is the smallest, with capacity of 100 to 132 passengers,
and the -400 is the largest, able to carry 145 to 170 passengers.
   Deliveries of the 18 firm orders will be one a month during 1991
and two monthly during the first quarter of 1992, with options
possibly exercised in 1994 and 1995.
   The latest transaction brings USAir's current Boeing 737 orders
to 68 aircraft, which will be delivered between now and 1992, plus
96 options, which would be delivered between 1992 and 1995, USAir
said.
   Washington-based USAir currently operates a fleet of 56
737-300s, the most of any airline.
   Piedmont Aviation, a USAir subsidiary, operates 39 737-300s and
14 737-400s and has six additional 737-400s on order. Piedmont will
be merged with USAir on Aug 5.
   With the USAir order, Boeing has received orders this year for
319 jetliners valued at about $19.7 billion. Of those, 120 orders
are for 737s.
   In all of last year, Boeing had orders for 636 planes, valued at
$29.7 billion.
   Total 737 orders stand at 2,384, making it the most popular
commercial jet of all time.
   USAir also has ordered 20 Fokker 100 jets and holds options on
20 more. First delivery is scheduled for June. In addition, USAir
recently decided to buy as many as 40 MD-82 aircraft from McDonnell
Douglas Corp.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Terry Branstad asked federal
officials Tuesday to help soften the effects of a spring drought by
activating emergency feed programs and allowing cattle to graze on
fragile acres normally held out of production.
   ``Our recent scattered rains may have helped in some areas, but
certainly they were not dust-busters by any means,'' Branstad said.
   Branstad said up to 40 percent of the state's pasture has been
destroyed by dry weather this spring. Cattlemen said farmers
already have started selling off their herds and may speed up the
liquidation within the next two weeks if they do not get help.
   ``It is appropriate to take action early,'' the governor said.
``These are difficult times for our cattle producers.''
   Branstad asked U.S. Department of Agriculture officials to
activate emergency programs to give farmers financial aid in buying
feed and to allow grazing on highly erodable acres taken out of
production.
   Gene Wiese of Manning, president-elect of the Iowa Cattlemen's
Association, said farmers are facing a bleak future because the
prime months for growing pasture are April and May.
   ``This is normally when we have lush growth in our pastures,''
he said. ``In many areas of our state, that's just not happening.''
   Before any decision can be made on the assistance requests, a
county-by-county survey must be completed, something Branstad said
could take two weeks.
   Programs the governor requested include:
   _Allowing grazing on Conservation Reserve Program acres, land
for which farmers receive annual payments to hold out of
production. That grazing would be allowed initially for 30 days,
but could be extended if dry weather continues.
   _Activating an emergency feed program giving up to 5 cents per
pound for assistance to farmers purchasing feed.
   _Activating another feed program, where farmers can purchase
feed owned by the government for 75 percent of its loan value.
   ``They do not require any outlay of cash,'' Branstad said,
adding he was confident federal officials would approve the
request. ``We're not asking for anything that's out of line or that
will run into a wall of resistance.''
   Government officials, however, have warned that farmers should
not expect a massive federal bailout similar to one approved last
year due to the drought that gripped much of the Midwest.
   But Wiese said cattle farmers need some signal that government
will help or many will begin to sell herds.
   ``We need some assurances to carry on,'' he said.
   Branstad said the immediate threat was to livestock producers.
   ``We won't really know the impact on crops until much later,''
Branstad said. He said he would seek drought aid for other farmers
``if the drought continues and worsens throughout the year.''

<HEAD>Cray Posts Large Earnings Decline for First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cray Research Inc., the world's biggest
supercomputer maker, on Tuesday reported a 94 percent decline in
first-quarter earnings and said second-quarter earnings also could
be down significantly.
   The company reported first-quarter net earnings of $1.5 million,
or 5 cents a share, down from first-quarter earnings of $26.4
million, or 85 cents a share, for the same period in 1988.
First-quarter revenue was $116.1 million, compared with $145.9
million for the 1988 quarter.
   ``We entered the year expecting the delivery of computer systems
to be much higher in the second half of the year than the first,''
said Marcelo A. Gumucio, president and chief operating officer.
``The revenue results for the first quarter are consistent with
that outlook.
   ``Current delivery schedules indicate that more systems have
shifted to the last half of the year and we now expect revenue for
the second quarter to be similar to last year's second quarter,''
Gumucio said.
   But he added, ``We have not changed our objective of achieving a
10 percent revenue increase for the full year.''
   Gumucio said all operating areas are exercising strong expense
control in line with the company's revenue objective for the full
year ``while we continue to invest fully in new product development
projects to meet long-term objectives. Expenses will be spread more
evenly through the year than revenues.
   ``This affected earnings in the first quarter and earnings in
the second quarter could be down significantly from the same period
a year ago for the same reason,'' he said. ``Earnings for the full
year will depend primarily on our ability to meet the aggressive
delivery schedules for the third and fourth quarters.''
   During the first quarter, 13 systems were installed at customer
sites, including seven new systems and six used systems. Three of
the new systems were leased, as were four of the used systems, Cray
said.
   Cray posted a 6 percent increase in net earnings in 1988. It
reported $756.3 million in revenues and $156.6 million in net
profit for that year.
   Cray, based in Minneapolis, employs more than 5,200 people and
has manufacturing and development facilities in Chippewa Falls and
Rice Lake in Wisconsin and in Colorado Springs, Colo.

   Citing declines in revenues from oil,
natural gas and condensate production, Mesa Limited Partnership
reported a net income of $14.6 million, or 15 cents per common
unit, on revenues of $105 million for the first quarter of 1989.
   Earnings for the same period a year earlier were $19.3 million,
or 17 cents per common unit, on revenues of $95 million.
   Gas production increased for the quarter, mostly because of the
addition of Tenneco Inc. properties acquired by Mesa last year, the
Amarillo-based partnership said Tuesday.
   Spot prices for natural gas were down because of the warm winter
weather, the partnership said.

   Stock prices eased for the second day in a row
as traders pulled profits from a market that has been rising
steadily for four months.
   Analysts said many investors felt it was time to sell into the
market, considering the Dow Jones average's rise of more than 150
points in the last four weeks and uncertainty on the economy and
interest rates.
   ``It was a little excuse to take some profits,'' said Robert
O'Toole, manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Wall Street opened with a first-hour flurry, rewarding a
government report that showed durable goods orders rising 0.8
percent in March and a resilient Tokyo market that leaped despite
the prime minister's resignation announcement.
   But confidence soon sagged, analysts said, and steady selling
occurred as it did Monday.

<HEAD>Cable Industry Group Plans Programming for Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable industry leaders are teaming up to
encourage use of cable TV programming in the classroom, including a
new daily news program that could rival a similar show for schools
from Whittle Communications LP, cable industry and education
sources said Tuesday.
   The effort, which is expected to be announced at a news
conference Wednesday in Washington, D.C., comes on the heels of
Whittle's completion of a 25-show test in school classrooms of its
commercially-sponsored news program, Channel One.
   The cable group includes some of the nation's biggest cable
programmers and operators led by Turner Broadcasting System Inc.,
which operates Cable News Network and reportedly will produce the
daily news show.
   The Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting scheduled a news
conference for Wednesday at the National Press Club to announce ``a
new venture to benefit American schools.''
   Also scheduled to attend were top officials of the cable
networks Arts &amp; Entertainment, C-Span and The Discovery Channel,
along with cable operators Tele-Communications Inc., Continental
Cablevision Inc. and Jones Intercable.
   Turner spokesmen refused to elaborate on the topic of the news
conference and the other participants either declined comment or
failed to return calls.
   But one education industry source, requesting anonymity, said he
had been told Turner will disclose plans for a daily news show for
use in schools.
   In addition to Turner's news show, the other networks either
would create new programming or more heavily promote the
availability of their existing shows for use in schools, cable
industry sources said.
   ``It will be a mix of programming of current events and some
cultural and educational type programming _ a nice mix,'' said one
cable executive familiar with the group's plans, discussing it
provided he was not identified.
   It was not clear whether the programming would contain
commercials as Whittle's Channel One service does or whether the
cable group would donate equipment on the scale of that envisioned
in the Channel One project.
   Whittle launched Channel One, a daily 12-minute news show with
two minutes of paid advertising, in six test schools March 6. The
schools were each given about $50,000 in video equipment, TV
monitors and satellite dishes in exchange for agreeing to run the
program every school day.
   The cable industry effort was being viewed in part as a way for
the cable industry to show it is being a good citizen at a time
when calls have arisen for greater regulation of the industry.
   It also reflects an effort to protect cable's turf against the
entry of an outsider, the Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle.
   Turner has been involved for two years in a joint venture with
the National School Boards Association called ``News Access'' that
has made available CNN's ``The Week in Review'' program and a
detailed classroom guide with suggestions on how to use portions of
the show in schools.
   The News Access program, which is being used in about 220
schools, relies on schools to use their own equipment to record and
show the program.
   C-Span, the Discovery Channel and the Arts &amp; Entertainment each
have their own arrangements for sharing programs and course guides
with schools.
   But none of those efforts has drawn the attention that Whittle's
Channel One test did.
   Whittle is reviewing the results of the seven-week test ended
last week and hopes to decide by mid-summer whether to make the
program available nationally in the fall of 1990.

<HEAD>Survey: Traders Doing Business as Usual, Resist More Federal Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traders surveyed by one of the country's largest
brokerage firms say they have not changed the way they do business
despite the government's investigation of activities at the Chicago
Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Eighty percent of more than 1,100 private speculators who
responded to the Lind-Waldock &amp; Co. survey said disclosure of the
FBI probe on Jan. 23 had not affected their trading methods, the
brokerage firm reported Tuesday.
   Sixty-nine percent said they believed trading pits at the
nation's commodity futures exchanges operate honestly and
efficiently _ but 63 percent thought the exchanges could do a
better job of policing themselves.
   ``We wanted to know how our customers felt about the industry,''
said Barry Lind, president of Lind-Waldock, a Chicago-based futures
discount brokerage.
   With futures trading in the headlines, he said, ``we thought it
would be a good time to get information.''
   The federal probe of suspected trading fraud at the Board of
Trade and the Merc, the world's two largest futures exchanges, has
not yet produced any official charges or indictments.
   Of those who said they had changed the way they traded, 12
people _ or 1 percent _ said they had stopped trading as a result
of the investigation. Others said they changed the type of orders
they placed or said they were trading less than before.
   The survey was of active clients as of March. The brokerage said
it did not have an unusual number of clients drop out in January
and March as the investigation became known.
   ``I tend to think we have a image problem,'' Lins said,
referring to those who had curtailed their trading. ``It's our
fault because of our esoteric business. We have to explain why we
are here and the importance of futures trading to the economy.''
   Most of those expressing dissatisfaction in the survey opposed
more federal regulation of futures trading, saying they feared it
would reduce liquidity and volume on the trading floors, increasing
the cost of transactions.
   ``I think the response to that question indicates the public
wants reform,'' Lind said. The exchanges understood that when they
created committees to recommend changes, he added.
   The ongoing investigation, in which undercover FBI agents have
posed as traders, reportedly centers on allegations that as many as
100 brokers and traders cheated customers out of millions of
dollars.
   A survey of traders conducted by the Wall Street Journal shortly
after the federal investigation was revealed indicated that trading
violations were numerous at the Mercantile Exchange.
   The 130 Chicago Merc traders responding to the Journal's survey
blamed the violations on the way exchange rules are written and
enforced. But they said cheating of customers was not common.
   Last week, a Chicago Merc panel recommended that most forms of
``dual trading'' be banned and floor surveillance of trading
doubled to prevent wrongdoing.
   Dual trading, which is legal, enables traders to trade for their
own accounts at the same time that they handle customers' orders.
   The Merc panel also recommended more extensive screening of
applicants for membership, reform of the exchange's disciplinary
committees and daily computerized trade information on the previous
day's trades for members.
   Lind-Waldock conducted its survey in March. It mailed forms to
4,353 of its 13,000 customers and 1,142 replied.
   ``We were happy at the very high positive response we received
and surprised at the extraordinarily high rate of return of our
questionnaires,'' Lind said. ``People actually thanked us for the
opportunity to voice their opinions.''
   Seventy-eight percent said they were well served by the current
open outcry system of filling orders. One respondent said attempts
to automate trading would decrease confidence in the futures
markets because it would take trading out of the public view.

<HEAD>Exxon Spill Has Generated Wave Of Lawsuits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. said Tuesday it has been hit with 31
lawsuits and 1,300 claims ranging from $500 to $4 million in
connection with last month's Alaskan oil spill and expects further
suits as well as government fines.
   At a meeting of securities analysts, top executives of the
nation's biggest oil company said Exxon already had paid $400,000
to settle smaller claims brought mainly by fishermen and cannery
workers whose jobs were disrupted because of the March 24 spill
that fouled hundreds of miles of coastline.
   Exxon executives declined to put a dollar value on the existing
lawsuits or the claims.
   Exxon Chairman Lawrence C. Rawl, who has been criticized for
staying out of sight in the crucial days following the disaster,
said that in retrospect he would have responded differently.
However, he said he did not understand the public anger against the
company, especially because it had accepted the blame and
apologized for the spill and was cleaning it up.
   ``I'm angry with myself,'' Rawl said. ``It's not really clear to
me as to why everyone is so angry _ once we get past the point of
admitting it was our ship that went on the rocks.''
   Exxon President Lee R. Raymond said all but two of the lawsuits
were class actions against the company. All but one were filed in
Alaska state and federal courts, he said, with the remaining suit
filed in California.
   Raymond said Exxon has four separate insurance policies totaling
$599.8 million in cleanup and liability coverage, including a $400
million policy that would pay off even in cases of company
negligence. But Raymond said the various policies can't necessarily
be added together.
   Raymond said the insurance would cover most, if not all, of the
cleanup costs and that ``therefore it's impossible for us at this
point to make any provision for our earnings for any reserves.''
   On Monday, Exxon announced that it had charged $30 million
against first-quarter earnings for expenses associated with the
salvage and repair of the broken tanker but not for the cleanup
itself.
   Raymond also said the company probably was subject to fines but
did not yet know what fines various government agencies might
impose.
   Rawl said the company did not anticipate any punitive damages
due to the spill, in which an Exxon tanker ran onto a reef and
spewed more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince
William Sound.
   ``There obviously was no intent on our part _ to put a very
expensive ship on Bligh reef, to put expensive oil in the water and
then a very, very, very expensive cleanup,'' Rawl said.
   In response to criticism that Exxon did not have enough people
working on the cleanup, Rawl said Exxon would increase the number
to about 4,000 by next month. He also reiterated his optimism that,
despite concerns by Alaska officials, the major part of the spill
would be cleaned up by September.
   Exxon told a news conference Monday that the cleanup was ahead
of the pace calculated in the oil company's federally-approved
plan, which estimates cleanup completion by Sept. 15.
   When questioned about the impact of a possible boycott against
Exxon, Rawl said that with anticipated tight supplies and high
demand during the summer season, ``it's hard to see this summer how
we wouldn't be able to sell all the gasoline we can make.''
   A number of consumer activists have called for a boycott of
Exxon to punish the company for what they claim is its poor
response to the disaster and alleged negligence leading to the
spill.
   ``The boycott will damage the dealers who are independent
business people,'' Rawl said.
   Rawl said the spill hasn't changed Exxon's outlook or spending
plans. He also declined to specify when the company would declare
its next dividend, which generally is issued quarterly.
   As to changing Exxon's tarnished image, he said, ``It's pretty
clear there's a better way to do that job, but we haven't had time
to sort that out. We're going to have to do a hell of a lot better
job than we have done.''

<HEAD>Study Shows Elderly Care Causing Wrinkles In The Workplace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees caring for elderly relatives often
experience job-related stress and increased absenteeism, and
corporate America can expect even more of these problems as the
population ages, a private study released Tuesday found.
   ``If elder care is a problem now _ and it is _ we had better
find good, humane answers soon. If we don't, the future ... will
turn into a nightmare for millions of us,'' said E. James Morton,
chairman of John Hancock Financial Services, which conducted the
study along with Fortune magazine.
   The study was based on responses from 370 senior executives and
369 people in the general employee population.
   It found that six out of 10 senior executives were aware of
specific work-related problems with elder care-giving employees.
   Forty-five percent of the executive respondents noticed employee
stress; 38 percent, unscheduled days off; 37 percent, late arrivals
and early departures; 32 percent, above-average use of the
telephone; and 30 percent, absenteeism, the survey said.
   Those in service companies were more likely than industrial
companies to report having these problems, the survey said.
   A vast majority of the employees questioned _ 70 percent _
admitted that taking care of elderly relatives or friends
interfered with job performance.
   Fifty-one percent of them said they felt increased tension on
the job as a result of their responsibilities, the survey said.
Forty-four percent also admitted to increased use of the telephone
and that same percentage had to take more time off for emergencies,
the survey said.
   Fourteen percent said their productivity was affected, it said.
   The survey found that women were more likely to shoulder
responsibilities for caring for the elderly and take a so-called
``daughter track'' approach, in which their careers are slowed as
they juggle work and parental care.
   Executives haven't been immune to these problems, either. The
survey said that half of them are personally responsible for an
elderly person now or have been in the past two years, and one out
of every two executives reports being concerned about maintaining
job performance.
   Care-givers spend on average 13 hours a week tending to the
elderly, usually a parent, with responsibilties ranging from
providing transportation and companionship to performing simple
household chores.
   About a quarter of all full-time employees in the United States
reportedly provide some care for the elderly, who represent roughly
12 percent of the U.S. population. That figure is likely to
increase over the years, with the elderly population expected to
nearly double by the year 2030 and as nursing home care expenses
rise.
   ``With this rapid increase in the elderly population and with
caring for the elderly being a family responsibility, we must
expect growing pressure on the workplace,'' said Leslie
Gaines-Ross, a research director for Fortune. ``This dual
responsibilty will be overwhelming _ both emotionally and
financially.
   ``This dual responsibility will affect business' bottom line,''
resulting from lost employee production and higher health-care
expenses.
   Few companies, though, offer programs to deal with this problem,
other than providing things like unpaid leaves of absence or
personal days to their employees, Ms. Gaines-Ross noted.
   ``It might be beneficial for corporations to educate managers as
to the enormity of elder care responsibilities,'' she said.
``Understanding the problem goes a long way to coping with it and
resolving it.''
   The survey's margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage
points.

   Contracts settled through collective
bargaining in the first three months of 1989 gave workers average
annual wage increases of 3.1 percent over the life of the pacts,
the government reported Tuesday.
   The wage gains were up from the 2.2 percent average raises
provided during the life of contracts settled in the fourth quarter
of 1988 and also ahead of the 2.4 percent average wage gains
contained in collective bargaining agreements settled in all of
last year.
   Analysts said the new gains were in line with other Labor
Department data showing wage inflation growing because of tight
labor markets.
   The quarterly report on collective bargaining, like the Labor
Department's broader Employment Cost Index report, showed workers
in the fast-growing service sector winning larger wage gains than
manufacturing workers.
   ``That's where the tighter labor markets are,'' chief economist
Allen Sinai of Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc. said of
service-providing parts of the economy.
   The Labor Department said the 64 first-quarter collective
bargaining agreements it analyzed covered 199,000 workers. The
average length of the contracts was just under three years, with
only seven being for less than two years.
   First-year pay gains averaged 3.2 percent with average wage
increases of 3.1 percent in the second and third years of the
contracts, the department said.
   The government, which tracks agreements covering bargaining
units with at least 1,000 members, said 107 such contracts
affecting 636,000 workers had expired or been reopened in the first
quarter but had not been settled or ratified by April 1.
   Of that group, about 350,000 employees worked for railroads and
104,000 for airlines, with the remaining number dispersed
throughout a variety of industries.
   The first-quarter report showed that workers who received
lump-sum payments from their employers or had cost-of-living
adjustment clauses in their contracts on average received smaller
wage increases than workers who received neither of those forms of
compensation.
   About 30,000 workers got lump-sum payments as part of contracts
negotiated in the first quarter and their pay raises averaged 1.8
percent a year over the lives of the new contracts.
   Contracts affecting 21,000 workers contained COLA clauses,
generally tied to the government's inflation index, and the annual
wage gains in those agreements averaged 2.4 percent, the government
said.
   More than 75 percent of the workers whose contracts were settled
in the first quarter worked in the non-manufacturing sector of the
economy, and their annual pay gains averaged 3.3 percent over the
lives of the contracts.
   In the manufacturing sector, where lump-sum payments and COLA
clauses are prevalent, wage increases averaged 2.3 percent annually
over the contract lives.

<TEXT>
   President Bush quoted several sports
figures _ Tommy Lasorda, Satchel Paige and Woody Hayes _ and gave a
``high five to high tech'' during a pep talk on competitiveness
Tuesday in Silicon Valley.
   Critics complained, however, that he didn't say enough about
unfair trade by foreign competitors in his speech before business
leaders and workers at Ford Aerospace's Space Systems Division.
   After Bush received boos for his reference to Lasorda, the Los
Angeles Dodgers manager who is an enemy to San Francisco Giants
fans, the president won applause for advocating a cut in the
capital gains tax and a boost in spending for NASA and other
science and technology.
   He praised Ford Aerospace, which recently delivered the first of
two communications Superbird satellites to Japan in a $209 million
contract, as a good example of America's ability to compete
internationally.
   ``Today, American satellites are among the most competitive
spacecraft for customers who want affordable, high-powered
communications satellites,'' Bush said.
   He quoted former pitcher Satchel Paige _ ``Don't look back.
Somebody might be gaining on you.'' _ and said America must invest
in the future by developing new programs to accommodate a changing
workforce.
   As an example, Bush cited Ford's Employee Assistance Program,
which helps workers find child-care help.
   Though Bush offered no new strategies for increasing U.S.
productivity or improving America's ability to compete abroad, his
appearance in the nation's high-technology capital early in his
term showed an eagerness to stimulate business.
   ``I think it fires up the people to want to be competitive, to
realize they're making progress, and to want to be in the forefront
of America's success for exports and products for our own use,''
said Robert E. Berry, vice president and general manager of Ford's
Space Systems Division.
   Chris Hoeber, director of Ford's commercial space programs
operations, led Bush on a tour of the facility's space
environmental chamber, which duplicates temperatures in space, and
showed him the next Superbird satellite.
   ``This is a case study to show American businessmen what is
possible if they're willing to take the time and make the
investment in Japan and other countries,'' said Hoeber. ``There's
no reason why Americans can't be as competitive as anyone else.''
   Larry Stone, mayor of Sunnyvale in the heart of Silicon Valley,
criticized Bush for saying very little about fair, free trade and
the restrictive policies of other countries.
   But Stone commended Bush for returning to an area that he lost
``fairly handily'' in the November election.
   ``He came back within the first 100 days and gave a message that
I think will be widely accepted by the corporations here _ the
capital gains tax and the extension on research and development tax
credits.''
   Rep. Tom Campbell, the first-term Republican congressman and
Stanford Business School professor who represents much of Silicon
Valley, accompanied Bush on his first domestic speaking tour since
entering office.
   ``The R&amp;D tax credit is so important and the capital gains tax
is critical,'' Campbell said. ``He's hitting it in every speech.''
   Campbell said he talked with Bush aboard Air Force One about
other ways to boost competitiveness, including improving access to
foreign markets, ending excessive litigation and guarding against
transferring technology to other countries that could hurt U.S.
business.
   ``We talked explicitly about access to foreign markets in
connection with the semiconductor agreement to sell to Japan,''
Campbell said. Bush did not mention the semiconductor problem in
his speech.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Prices Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices surged in brisk trading
Tuesday, with gasoline leading the pack amid continued concerns
about supplies.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for
wholesale unleaded gasoline jumped 3.93 cents to settle at 76.16
cents a gallon, after dropping 1.93 cents on Monday. Other contract
months were up sharply.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. grade of crude oil, closed on the exchange at $21.41 a
42-gallon barrel, up 80 cents from Monday, when it fell 71 cents.
   May wholesale heating oil, which slid 1.82 cents in the previous
session, gained 0.27 cent to settle at 52.08 cents a gallon.
   Andrew Lebow, a senior trader with E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., attributed the gasoline rally partly to expectations
that the latest American Petroleum Institute weekly report due out
late Tuesday would show decreased supplies in the wake of the Exxon
oil tanker spill in Valdez, Alaska.
   An explosion in the North Sea last week also compounded fears of
an already tight gasoline supply situation as the summer driving
season approaches.
   On Tuesday, Exxon Corp. and Shell U.K., the British unit of
Royal Dutch Shell Group, said they expected a prolonged shutdown in
production in that area.
   The North Sea accident has disrupted the flow of Brent crude
through a major pipeline, affecting the production of at least
500,000 barrels a day.

<HEAD>Soybeans Plunge Again On Wetter Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Tuesday for the second
consecutive session on the Chicago Board of Trade as scattered
rainfall in the Midwest continued to cool drought fears. Wheat
futures finished nearly unchanged.
   On other markets, petroleum futures prices surged; hog futures
advanced strongly while other livestock and meat markets were
mixed; and precious metals prices declined.
   Wheat settled 1\ cents lower to 1} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.14{ a bushel; corn was 3 cents
to 5 cents lower with May at $2.64 a bushel; oats were 5{ cents to
7\ cents lower with May at $1.89 a bushel; soybeans were 10 cents
to 15 cents lower with May at $7.32{ a bushel.
   Overnight rain in the western Corn Belt and forecasts for more
rain over the next few days prompted moderate to heavy selling of
soybean, corn and oat futures contracts right from the opening bell.
   ``It's a weather market,'' said John Frazier, a grain-market
analyst in Chicago with Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   The various private forecasters used by futures traders were in
closer agreement about the weather outlook than they had been in
the past two weeks, Frazier said.
   The National Weather Service issued a six-to-10-day forecast
late Monday that predicted normal temperatures and normal rainfall
in the Midwest early next week.
   The Agriculture Department reported that corn planting got under
way in most major producing areas last week. Soybean planting will
begin in early May.
   But the USDA also said most of the Kansas winter wheat crop was
in poor to very poor condition last week due to a lack of moisture.
That report helped support the wheat market.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gasoline prices jumped
nearly 4 cents a gallon, fueled by rumors of problems on the Alaska
pipeline and concerns about refiners' ability to provide
cleaner-burning gasoline to states mandating a switch to a tougher
anti-pollution standard.
   ``It was a wild and crazy day in that respect,'' said Peter
Beutel, a New York analyst for Elders Futures Inc. ``I can't
remember the last time there was a near 4-cent increase in gasoline
prices, if ever.''
   Beutel said the rally also was helped along by word that an oil
platform damaged last week in the North Sea will be out of action
into early May.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents lower to 80
cents higher with June at $21.41 a barrel; heating oil was .05 cent
lower to .27 cent higher, with May at 52.08 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .40 cent to 3.93 cents higher, with May at
76.16 cents a gallon.
   Hog prices for June, July and August delivery leaped on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid signs that hog slaughter levels
are falling.
   The rally extended Monday's slight gains in a market
strengthened by bullish chart patterns.
   ``It's all due to expectations we're going to be getting into
lighter kills in June, July and August,'' said Phil Stanley, an
independent livestock trader in Chicago.
   Cattle futures finished mixed after rebounding from a steep
slide that flushed many small speculators out of the market,
Stanley said.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June
at 70.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent lower to .12
cent higher with May at 76 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent
lower to 1 cent higher with June at 46.60 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .60 cent lower to .35 cent higher with May at
31.57 cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures retreated on New York's Commodity
Exchange, erasing much of the previous session's advance, in the
face of a stronger U.S. dollar and a smaller-than-expected increase
in March durable-goods orders, both signs that inflationary
pressures are easing.
   Gold settled $2 to $2.50 lower with June at $388.89 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.6 cents to 3.8 cents lower with May at $5.795 a
troy ounce.

   The dollar finished higher against most major
currencies Tuesday, recovering from an early selloff.
   Gold prices declined slightly in U.S. dealings after edging a
bit higher on foreign markets. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid of $384.75 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EDT, $2
lower than Monday's late bid.
   Zlatko Glamuzina, chief currency dealer at Banco di Sicilia,
said dealers sold dollars after the Commerce Department released a
report on ``big ticket'' durable goods orders.
   The reported said orders rose 0.8 percent in March. But,
excluding the increase in the volatile transportation category,
orders were off 2.8 percent and analysts interpreted the figure as
evidence of slower economic growth.
   A report from the National Association of Realtors said sales of
existing homes dropped for the third straight month in March to the
slowest pace in more than a year, an indication that rising
mortgage interest rates are discouraging home buyers.
   On the inflation front, the Labor Department said wages and
salaries paid American workers in private industry rose 4.2 percent
in the last 12 months, the biggest jump in 3{ years. The Employment
Cost Index reading was consistent with recent reports pointing to a
buildup in inflationary pressures in a tight job market.
   Glamuzina said the dollar slowly recovered amid mainly
institutional buying. Trading was fairly subdued, he said.
   The markets were quiet ahead of the first-quarter U.S. gross
national product report due on Wednesday, foreign exchange dealers
said.
   The announcement that Japan's Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
will resign focused attention on the yen. The Japanese currency was
firmer as a result.
   The dollar closed at 131.17 yen, down from Monday's late 131.38.
In London late Tuesday, the dollar traded higher at 131.28 yen, and
at 131.475 yen in New York, down from 131.55 yen Monday.
   In London one British pound cost $1.7030 late Tuesday, cheaper
for buyers than Monday's late level of $1.7050. Sterling stood at
$1.69945 in New York compared to $1.70625 Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
levels, included: 1.86655 West German marks, up from 1.86075;
1.64625 Swiss francs, up from 1.6420; 1.18925 Canadian dollars,
unchanged; 6.3175 French francs, up from 6.3070; and 1,367.20
Italian lire, up from 1,364.625.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Monday's
late rates included: 1.8625 West German marks, up from 1.8575;
1.6435 Swiss francs, up from 1.6395; 6.3065 French francs, up from
6.2975; 2.1000 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0960; and, 1.1910 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1890.
   Italian markets were closed for a holiday. In London, the dollar
closed at 1,366.00 Italian lire, up from 1,362.50 in Italy on
Monday.
   Gold bullion prices rose by less than $1 an ounce on markets
abroad and then fell in U.S. trading.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $385.70 a troy ounce from Monday's settlement of
$387.70.
   The late bid price for gold in London, the major European
precious metals market, was $385.75 a troy ounce, up from $384.90
late Monday. The late Zurich bid price was $385, up from $384.65.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $385.65 bid, up from $384.05.
   Silver prices barely budged overseas and edged slighly lower in
the United States. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery closed at $5.789 a troy ounce, down from $5.825 Monday.
Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.81 bid a troy ounce,
unchanged.

<HEAD>USX Profits Rise; Bethlehem Profits Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp.'s profits shot up 88 percent while Bethlehem Steel
Corp.'s profits fell 24 percent, the nation's biggest and
second-biggest steelmakers said Tuesday in first-quarter reports.
   Pittsburgh-based USX said its net income surged 88 percent to
$296 million, or $1.09 per share, led by a near three-fold increase
in operating income at Marathon Oil Co.
   Operating income from steel sagged 40 percent to $99 million on
sales of $1.5 billion.
   Income from continuing operations at Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp.
shrank from $7 million to $3 million even though sales grew 42
percent from $276 million to $393 million.
   Texas Oil &amp; Gas eported operating income of $147 million, but
$144 million of that came from the settlement of lawsuits
concerning take-or-pay supply contracts, said company spokesman
William P. Ryder.
   Overall sales grew by 12.5 percent to $4.5 billion from $4.0
billion in the 1988 first quarter, when profits were $157 million,
or 52 cents per share.
   Marathon contributed operating income of $241 million on $2.4
billion in first-quarter sales compared with $84 million on $2.1
billion in sales a year earlier.
   ``Second-quarter operating results should be even stronger'' in
energy, USX Chairman David M. Roderick said in a printed statement.
   Marathon's improvement was the result of higher profit margins
on refined products, greater volume and higher prices for crude oil
and natural gas and lower exploration costs. The company spent $31
million exploring for oil and gas in the first quarter, down from
$50 million a year earlier.
   Operating income in steel declined from $167 million on sales of
$1.4 billion.
   ``The decline ... was due primarily to continued weakness in the
oil country tubular goods market and increased costs for raw
materials,'' Roderick said.
   Income from the diversified group of USX dropped from $98
million on $341 million in 1988 first-quarter sales to $30 million
on $252 million in sales, reflecting the sale of businesses in the
group and a $43 million on-time credit last year.
   USX received $83 million in extraordinary income in the first
quarter due primarily to the sale of assets, including the
phosphate fertilizer business of the Agri-Chemicals dividion and
the sale of 25 percent of Quebec Cartier Mining Co.
   The company boosted capital spending by $143 million to $372
million.
   ``Even after this relatively heavy capital spending ... the
corporation's cash balance continues over $2 billion,'' Roderick
said. ``This cash flow for the first quarter is on track with our
goal of generating more than $1 billion in 1989, permitting
continuation of our program to strengthen our balance sheet and
enhance shareholder value.''
   Bethlehem Steel said its 24 percent decline was the result of a
one-time charge.
   The Bethlehem, Pa.-based steelmaker said its net income fell to
$64.7 million, or 78 cents per share, from $85.4 million, or $1.23
per share, a year earlier. Sales rose 5.6 percent to $1.4 billion
from $1.33 billion in the comparable period a year earlier.
   The nation's second-largest steelmaker said it charged $55
million against the first quarter as the cost of reorganizing its
troubled Baltimore Marine Division. The division could be hurt
further by a strike that was begun March 17 by members of the
International Association of Machinists, Bethlehem said.
   The 1988 first quarter results included a charge of $19 million
over a coal mine fire and employee benefits and a $10 million
credit as an investment tax credit refund.
   Shipments increased 2 percent from 2.6 million tons to 2.7
million tons. Production declined 1 percent to 3.2 million tons as
the company operated at 82 percent of capacity, only 1 percentage
point below the 1988 first quarter.
   Chairman Walter F. Williams said he expects shipments to remain
about the same at least through the second quarter. He said second
half industry shipments will decline from levels of the first half.
   Bethlehem's future financial performance will be affected by its
contract negotiations with the United Steelworkers and by the
extent to which the Bush administration's renews steel import
quotas due to expire in September, Williams said.

<HEAD>Profits Off at Times Mirror, Washington Post in Absence of One-Time
Gains</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Tops with 1 new graf to include Knight-Ridder. Adds 6 grafs
with Knight Ridder details.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Times Mirror Co. and Washington Post Co. said Tuesday their
first-quarter earnings fell from the levels of last year, when they
had one-time gains on asset sales. Another media company,
Knight-Ridder Inc., also reported a decline in its first-quarter
profit.
   Times Mirror, owner of the Los Angeles Times, Newsday and other
papers, said it earned $68.8 million, or 53 cents a share, in the
first quarter, down 8 percent from $75.1 million, or 58 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter sales rose 9.3 percent to $846.9 million from
$774.6 million a year earlier.
   The Times Mirror results for the first quarter of 1988 included
an after-tax gain of $15.3 million from sale of timberland and of
Times-Mirror Press. If that gain were excluded, this year's profit
would have risen 15 percent, the Los Angles-based media concern
said.
   Newspaper publishing revenue, hurt in recent months by soft
demand for advertising, rose 11 percent in the quarter because of
higher advertising volume, cost-cutting and the fact the accounting
period was five days longer than last year's. Advertising
performance improved at the Los Angeles Times and Baltimore Sun
papers, but continued slow in New York.
   Revenue rose 9 percent for book, magazine and other publishing
and 17 percent for cable television. Broadcast TV revenue declined
less than 1 percent.
   In addition to the Times, Newsday and the Baltimore Sun papers,
Times Mirror holdings include The Hartford Courant, The (Allentown,
Pa.) Morning Call, The (Stamford, Conn.) Advocate and Greenwich
(Conn.) Time; KDFW-TV in Dallas and other publishing, broadcast and
cable TV operations.
   Washington Post, which owns the Washington Post newspaper and
Newsweek magazine and has interests in TV stations and cable
television, said its earnings tumbled 71 percent to $41.5 million,
or $3.22 a share, in the first quarter from $144.8 million, or
$11.25 a share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 6.5 percent to $341.9 million from
$321.2 million a year earlier.
   The 1988 results had included a non-recurring gain of $115.7
million from the sale of cellular telephone interests.
   Excluding that gain, the company said its earnings would have
risen 42 percent from a year earlier.
   Newspaper division revenue rose 7 percent in the latest quarter
as advertising lineage at the Washington Post edged up 3 percent.
   Revenue from the company's four television stations rose 5
percent and cable division revenue rose 13 percent. Newsweek's
revenue rose 1 percent from a year ago.
   Miami-based Knight-Ridder said its profit fell 39.3 percent to
$20.5 million, or 39 cents a share, from $33.8 million, or 59 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 10.4 percent to $540.7 million from
$489.7 million a year earlier.
   Robert F. Singleton, senior vice president and chief financial
officer, said, ``This was a difficult quarter, but the results were
just about what we expected when we set our 1989 budget.''
   He said more than half of the decline was due to acquisitions,
including the purchase of Dialog Information Services and an
investment in a cable operation, while the rest reflected
``softness in operations and higher interest rates.''
   He said he expected growth in earnings per share for the year,
partly because of softening newsprint prices, stronger operating
results from the newspaper division and growth in business
information services.
   He said the company also expects to benefit from lower interest
costs as the result of the previously-disclosed agreements to sell
its eight television stations and two newspapers.
   Knight-Ridder owns 30 newspapers, offers a variety of electronic
business information services and has interests in cable television.

<HEAD>Thousands to Receive Refund on Overcharge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   US Sprint Communications Co. plans to give
refunds to thousands of customers in Las Vegas after one man
complained he was overcharged $60 by the long-distance telephone
company.
   Sprint officials have acknowledged that thousands of their
22,000 Las Vegas customers were overcharged from April through
August of 1988 because computers recorded the wrong time of day for
the phone calls. The mistake also affected credit-card customers
dialing from Las Vegas.
   Sprint officials declined to estimate how much the refunds would
be.
   The refunds were prompted by Lenny Frome, a Las Vegas resident
who complained about a billing error to the company last year.
   Frome, a retired aerospace engineer who teaches mathematics at
the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, figured the company owed him
about $60 in overcharges. When he felt the company was delaying in
resolving the issue, Frome took his complaint to former Sen. Chic
Hecht, R-Nev., who passed it along to the Federal Communications
Commission.
   Michael Furtney, a vice president of corporate relations for
Sprint, said Tuesday the company was correcting the situation when
the FCC notified Sprint about the complaint.
   Furtney defended any delays in dealing with Frome, saying
erroneous charges are ``hard to find in a company that's generating
billions of dollars in revenues.''
   ``It's like looking for a needle in a haystack,'' he said.
   Furtney said the company plans to identify all overcharged
customers within two weeks. He said customers should receive
refunds within a month after that.

   Stock prices slumped Tuesday as traders pulled
profits from an unenthusiastic market and oil and technology
company earnings declined.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 15.77 points to
2,386.91, the second straight decline after a four-week rise that
pushed the market to post-crash highs.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
687 up, 827 down and 471 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 165.43 million
shares, up from 142.10 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 196.49 million shares.
   Analysts cited a tepid environment with traders lacking
conviction in the recently rising market. They said the gains were
achieved in fits and starts, not in a solid atmosphere, and the
selloffs this week reflected that weakness.
   ``It's like being a 100-yard dash runner in a marathon,'' said
Dennis E. Jarrett, a technical analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
``You last a little bit then you have to rest.''
   Analysts said many investors felt it was time to sell into the
market, considering the Dow Jones average's rise of more than 150
points in the last month and uncertainty on the economy and
interest rates.
   ``It was a little excuse to take some profits,'' said Robert
O'Toole, manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Wall Street opened with a first-hour flurry after a government
report that showed durable goods orders rising 0.8 percent in March
and a resilient Tokyo market that leaped despite Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita's resignation announcement.
   But confidence soon sagged, analysts said, and steady selling
occurred as it did Monday, when the Dow Jones lost 6.78 points but
remained above 2,400.
   Tuesday's weakness was greatest in oil, technology and airline
stocks.
   Among the most active issues, Citizens and Southern plunged 4|
to 29] as 2.5 million shares changed hands. The decline followed
NCNB's withdrawal of its buyout offer for the Atlanta bank.
   Cray Research plummeted 6[ to 49. The world's biggest
supercomputer maker reported a 94 percent drop in first-quarter
profits and forecast significantly lower second-quarter earnings as
well.
   The announcement spurred fluctuations in other technology
stocks. Hewlett Packard lost 1[ to 55~; Digital Equipment dipped ~
to 95~; Control data fell 1 to 19{. IBM was up 1 to 114{ after
announcing a 10 percent increase in its dividend.
   Oil stocks were lower across the board on industry-wide earnings
well below expecations. Chevron was the biggest loser, dropping 1|
to 54, after reporting a 52 percent earnings slide. Mobil fell 1]
to 50; Occidental Petroleum lost { to 27[; Atlantic Richfield was
off 1[ to 93[; Exxon lost | to 44.
   Texaco was down ~ to 53~, as its fivefold first-quarter earnings
rise was attributed to a one-time gain from a restructuring.
   NWA, parent of Northwest Airlines, dropped 2{ to 100\ after the
company's board rejected a buyout offer from investor Marvin Davis.
   Disappointing auto sales figures also pushed carmaker stocks
lower, with General Motors off 1\ to 41| on a sales decline from a
year ago. Chrysler, which also reported a decline, was down [ at
24. Ford Motor gained ] to 48} after reporting a slight sales
increase.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $14.081 billion, or 0.46
percent, in value from Monday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.89 to 171.6.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index was down 2.24 to 353.91, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index fell 1.94 to 306.75.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.47 to 422.71. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 343.07, up 0.31.

<HEAD>Crop Yields Could Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private analyst said Tuesday that poor
moisture reserves in much of the nation's midsection have already
taken a modest bite out of this year's crop yields and that the
situation could worsen if the rains aren't abundant this spring.
   Economist John Schnittker, head of Schnittker Associates, a
Washington-based agricultural consulting firm, said that the 1988
drought ``remains the leading force in world agriculture,'' at
least until more is known about this year's crops of wheat and corn.
   Both Schnittker and the Agriculture Department project huge
declines in world and U.S. inventories as a result of last year's
drought-shriveled yields in North America.
   By July 1, he said, the global grain inventory going into the
new 1989-90 season will be down to a 61-day supply, compared with
an 87-day reserve last summer. That will be the smallest reserve
since the early 1970s, when global grain stocks were drawn down to
a 57-day supply.
   Speaking to a meeting of the National Association of
Agricultural Journalists, Schnittker said the supply situation puts
the United States ``sort of on the razor's edge'' because of the
uncertainties about 1989 crop conditions.
   Although many areas are dramatically improved from last year's
summer drought, parts of the Great Plains and Corn Belt are still
woefully dry. Even in some areas that have moderate surface
moisture, the reserves deep in the subsoil are scant.
   ``And if we do have a second adverse crop-growing season, the
effect will be substantially larger in the commodities markets and
in the consumer food retail markets than they have been the past
year,'' Schnittker said.
   The reduced 1988 harvests forced up market prices for the major
crops as it became apparent that the U.S. granary would be
partially emptied.
   Schnittker said he finds himself ``disagreeing quite a lot''
with USDA's chief meteorologist, Norton Strommen, who told the farm
writers earlier that he was still optimistic that crop conditions
will improve and that nationally the United States can have a
productive year.
   Strommen and others maintain the fate of the U.S. winter wheat
crop will not be known for another month or so and that farmers
still have not planted spring wheat or made much of a dent in
planting corn.
   ``If I seem a little on the optimistic side, it may be that I'm
looking at changes that have occurred and the improvements that
have taken place since the fall of 1988 and the real harshness of
the 1988 drought,'' Strommen said.
   Acknowledging there are pockets of drought problems still around
_ Kansas, for example, where about 75 percent of the winter wheat
is reported in very poor or poor condition _ Strommen said many
other sections of the country have had good moisture last year in
recent months.
   ``When you put all of the big parts together, the overall
outlook for the country is much improved over what it was last
year,'' Strommen said. ``But we are still deeply concerned about
the pockets and the problems we have in the western Great Plains
and the central part of the Corn Belt.''
   Schnittker said Strommen ``may turn out to be right, but it
seems to me, with the extreme ... subsoil drought concentrated on
the central Corn Belt at the moment, that it is prudent for private
forecasters, at least, to reduce the probable corn yield a little
bit.''
   Already, he said, the moisture problems have shaved this year's
average corn yield. If all had been normal, the yield trend pointed
to an average of about 120 bushels per acre, but Schnittker says he
thinks 115 bushels are more likely.
   That would mean a 1989 corn harvest of about 7.54 billion
bushels, up from 5.1 billion bushels estimated for 1988. The USDA
currently estimates last year's corn harvest at 4.92 billion
bushels but has not projected the 1989 crop.
   Based on April 25 conditions, Schnittker forecast this year's
total U.S. wheat harvest at 2.15 billion bushels, about 300 million
bushels less than the output would be if moisture conditions had
been normal. Last year's wheat harvest was 1.81 billion bushels.

<HEAD>Procter &amp; Gamble Earnings Up; Kimberly-Clark's Also</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Tuesday reported a 17.9 percent increase in
earnings for the January to March quarter and another big consumer
products company, Kimberly-Clark Corp., said its quarterly income
went up 10.5 percent.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, said its after-tax
earnings rose to $310 million, or $1.85 a share, in the three
months ended March 31, up from $263 million, or $1.53 a share, a
year earlier.
   Sales rose to $5.43 billion in the January-March period, the
third quarter in the company's fiscal year, up 11.7 percent from
$4.86 billion a year earlier.
   The company credited higher selling prices, greater sales
volumes and currency translation adjustments as reasons for its
profit growth. These factors were partially offset by a higher
estimated tax rate.
   For the first nine months of Procter &amp; Gamble's fiscal year, net
income came to $1.04 billion, or $6.13 a share, on sales of $15.97
billion. In the corresponding period the year before, earnings were
$880 million, or $5.14 a share, and sales totaled $14.36 billion.
   The company manufactures and markets a wide range of laundry and
cleaning products, personal care products, foods and beverages,
plus a variety of items used by businesses and industry.
   In a release from Kimberly-Clark's Dallas office, the company
said its first quarter income increased to $103.1 million, or $1.28
share, from $93.3 million, or $1.16 a share, in 1988's first
quarter.
   Sales amounted to $1.42 billion, a 9.9 percent pickup from the
comparable 1988 quarter, in which sales totaled $1.29 billion.
   Net income improved because of increased earnings from equity
companies and lower interest expense, Darwin E. Smith, chairman and
chief executive, said in a statement.
   About 60 percent of the sales improvement in the quarter can be
attributed to increased sales volumes, which were achieved in most
major businesses, Smith said. Volume increases were led by consumer
tissue, feminine care and disposable diaper businesses in the
United States and Canada.
   Operating profit, however, dropped 4.9 percent to $171.7 million
from $180.5 million.
   Kimberly-Clark attributed the drop in operating profit to higher
marketing expenses because of intense competition. It also cited
weakening newsprint markets, higher fiber costs worldwide and
expenses associated with new products, particularly Huggies
Pull-Ups training pants.
   Kimberly-Clark is a manufacturer of household, personal care and
health care products, including Kleenex tissues, and newsprint and
business, correspondence and specialty papers.

<HEAD>Chairman: Alaska Spill Should Not Stall Exploration in Wildlife Refuge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Alaska oil spill is a tragic accident that
should not be used to prevent oil industry development of such
controversial sites as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Amoco
Corp.'s top official told shareholders Tuesday.
   Th spill resulted from a transportation accident unrelated to
oil exploration or production, Richard M. Morrow, Amoco's chairman
and chief executive officer, told the company's 100th annual
meeting in prepared remarks.
   ``Overseas oil is being transported daily to ports throughout
the U.S. by an increasing number of ocean tankers,'' Morrow said.
``These tanker shipments will continue to escalate in the years
ahead if we do not develop more of this nation's energy resources _
particularly oil and natural gas.''
   Morrow, who also is chairman of the American Petroleum
Institute, said the industry is re-examining its operational
policies in the wake of the spill. He said a task force of top
oil-company executives is conducting a comprehensive review of
industry spill-prevention and cleanup capabilities.
   Two weeks after the Exxon Corp. spill of 11 million gallons of
crude oil in fragile Prince William Sound, President Bush called
the accident an ``aberration'' that had not dissuaded him from
urging Congress to authorize exploratory drilling in the Arctic
refuge.
   ``I am not going to suggest that because of this (spill) that we
should rethink a policy of trying to get this country less
dependent on foreign oil,'' Bush said.
   Environmentalists disagree.
   ``If we want to prospect for oil, we should do it in Detroit,''
director Scott Denman of the Safe Energy Communication Council said
earlier this month.
   Amoco recently has been emphasizing its overseas operations,
company spokesman Richard Judy acknowledged.
   But he said the opening of some of the ``last-frontier'' areas
domestically _ such as the Arctic refuge on Alaska's North Slope
and other sites considered environmentally fragile _ would present
new opportunities for domestic exploration and production.
   Amoco has no share of the Prudhoe Bay oil fields on the North
Slope, whose crude oil is channeled through the trans-Alaska
pipeline to tankers at Valdez like the one that caused the
disastrous March 24 spill.
   The company does have limited production in Alaska's Cook Inlet
and a small share in a field in the Beaufort Sea, as well as
inactive exploration acreage in Bristol Bay and the Beaufort and
Chukchi seas, Judy said.

   Volkswagen of America Inc. on Tuesday
announced an incentive program offering U.S. Savings Bonds to
people who buy or lease a new Volkswagen until May 31.
   The program offers buyers or leasers bonds ranging from $1,000
to $4,000 in face value, depending on the model chosen. For those
who don't want a bond, Volkswagen will contribute the purchase
price, generally half of the face value, toward the buyer's down
payment.
   The bonds, series EE, carry 6 percent interest rates and mature
in 10 to 12 years. No cash rebates are being offered, Volkswagen
spokesman Jay Amestoy said.
   Volkswagen of America is the U.S. marketing arm for the West
German automaker Volkswagen AG.

   Du Pont Co. and Waste Management Inc. said
Tuesday they had signed a letter of intent to form a joint plastics
recycling venture to help deal with the growing amount of solid
waste from the nation's municipalities.
   ``It's a unique venture. It brings together the two largest
companies in their respective fields,'' said Frank Aronhalt,
director of environmental affairs for Du Pont, based in Wilmington,
Del.
   The companies did not disclose the value of the deal.
   Aronhalt said a new plastics recycling plant will be built
somewhere in the Midwest or Southeast.
   ``We hope to have the first plant up and running by the early
1990s,'' he said.
   The first plant will have a recycling capacity of up to 40
million pounds annually, the companies said.
   Under the plan, old plastic will be collected and separated by
Waste Management then sent to be treated and upgraded into
materials that can be reused by various industries, including the
automotive and airline industries, Aronhalt said.
   ``From collection to recycling, we'll now have a closed loop,''
Aronhalt said.
   Waste Management, based in Oak Brook, Ill., collects waste from
more than 8 million residential and industrial customers.

<HEAD>Miller Starts New Commercials To Boost High Life Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attempting to reverse the decline in its
flagship High Life brand, Miller Brewing Co. unveiled new
commercials Tuesday promoting the beer as a reward for everyday
heros.
   The new High Life campaign, under the slogan, ``The best comes
shining through,'' is reminiscent of the Miller-time commercials of
the 1970s that touted beer as a reward for regular work.
   For example, one commercial in the new series extols a man who
helps a woman cross the street, and another salutes a farmer who
helps harvest corn for the widow of a friend. Others praise a man
in a wheelchair who is playing basketball and show a member of a
car-racing team warning a competitor of a mechanical problem with
his car, thereby possibly losing the race but doing the honorable
thing at the same time.
   ``These ads portray people who do the right thing,'' said Robert
Toledo, vice president of brand management and promotions for
Miller. And unlike the Miller time ads ``these celebrate basic
human values and elevate the man and the beer'' and not just a
regular job well-done.
   High Life sales fell to sixth place last year from third in 1987
among the top domestic brewers, according to statistics from
Beverage Media, a liquor industry publication.
   Beverage Media estimated 8.5 million barrels of High Life were
sold last year, down from 9.3 million in 1987.
   Moving past High Life in the rankings were Bud Light at 9.7
million barrels, Coors Light at 8.7 million barrels and Busch at
8.6 million, the publication said.
   The top sellers were Budweiser at 50.6 million barrels and
Miller Lite at 19.6 million barrels.
   The new ad campaign for Miller High Life was the first developed
for the brand by Leo Burnett USA, Chicago.

   Defense spending cuts proposed Tuesday
include axing funds for the new V-22 Osprey transport aircraft, a
move which could cost the jobs of up to 2,000 Bell Helicopter
Textron Inc., company officials said.
   The workers could face layoffs within 10 days, and another 500
jobs could be cut within a year, Bell officials said in a letter to
employees before the cuts were formally proposed.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney outlined $10 billion in Pentagon
cuts before a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee. Cheney
said the Marine Corps has been told to scrap development of the
V-22 aircraft, which is manufactured as a joint project by Bell and
Boeing Helicopter Co. of Philadelphia.
   The two companies are developing the tilt-rotor aircraft under a
$1.8 billion contract, scheduled to run through mid-1992.
   The Pentagon is required to cut future spending plans by $10
billion for the next fiscal year under a budget agreement the Bush
administration and Congress reached earlier this spring.
   The cuts also reportedly were to include cancellation of another
large Bell program, the OH-58D AHIP helicopter.
   Although the company had not been officially informed of the
cuts, Bell was required by federal plant-closing legislation to
notify employees of possible layoffs, spokesman Bob Leder said.
   Leder said Bell has not formulated specific layoff plans, but he
said a ``worst-case scenario'' might require Bell to lay off 1,800
to 2,000 workers within 10 days.
   A total of 2,500 workers could lose their jobs within a year, he
added.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Myerson &amp; Kuhn, the law firm co-headed by former
baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn, has been accused of billing
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. approximately $2 million for work that
Shearson says the law firm did not perform.
   Michael O'Neill, a spokesman for Shearson, confirmed Tuesday the
existence of an investigation into the matter, disclosed in
Monday's editions of The Wall Street Journal.
   ``There have been billing irregularities,'' O'Neill said. ``We
have have brought them to the attention of Myerson &amp; Kuhn and we
have ended the relationship.''
   The law firm denied the charges.
   Myerson &amp; Kuhn was formed in 1988 and is headed by Kuhn and
Harvey Myerson.
   Shearson, which had been a client of Myerson's former law firm,
retained Myerson &amp; Kuhn for about $12 million annually, a financial
industry source said Tuesday. The Journal, quoting unidentified
sources, said the amount of overbilling was about $2 million.
   In addition, Myerson &amp; Kuhn said the Appellate Division of New
York State Supreme Court was looking into the matter after
receiving a complaint from Shearson. The Appellate Division, which
investigates allegations of misconduct, informed Myerson &amp; Kuhn at
the end of last week that it had 20 days to respond to the charges,
the spokesman said.
   ``There has never been a basis for a claim of overbilling,''
Myerson &amp; Kuhn said Tuesday in a statement. ``The orchestrated
public attack upon us, rather than an effort to present a claim in
a decent a businesslike way, is itself compelling evidence that
some agenda outside a good-faith dispute has motivated these
attacks.''

   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's
resignation likely will further delay action on the controversial
FSX fighter project, official sources said Tuesday.
   Some high-level sources suggested the end result could be a
weaker deal for the United States, or a complete unraveling of the
plan to jointly build a new fighter based on the American F-16.
   Takeshita's announcement that he would step down as a result of
an influence-peddling scandal brings new uncertainty to the
already-troubled FSX plan, said administration and congressional
officials, all of whom declined to be identified.
   The sources suggested it is now unlikely there will be any
movement in stalled negotiations on the project until a successor
to Takeshita takes office.
   ``It's not on the verge of being resolved now anyway,'' said one
administration soucre.
   ``We're continuing to try to clarify the conditions'' on the
project set down a month ago by U.S. negotiators. ``It's proven to
be a very difficult process.''
   Although President Bush signaled general support for the joint
venture in mid-March, Japanese officials balked at some of the
conditions he stipulated _ including a guarantee that U.S.
companies have a 40 percent share in the production of the new jet.
   The United States also wants assurances that any new technology
developed from the project would be available to the United States,
along with protection for U.S.-developed computer codes that help
fly and control the plane.
   The agreement to co-develop the FSX, which stands for Fighter
Support Experimental, was negotiated late last year between
Takeshita's government and the outgoing Reagan adminstration.
   Under the agreement, General Dynamics Corp. would build the
upgraded F-16 with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
   The plan encountered stiff opposition in the
Democratic-controlled Congress, where critics have called it a $7
billion giveaway of high technology to Japan _ suggesting the
United States would get little in return.
   Takeshita's resignation will make it ``harder to deal with the
issue,'' said Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   ``I think the position of the Japanese will be that, because
they're in a difficult circumstance, they can't give as much as
they might have on FSX,'' Gephardt said in an interview.
   He also said that the Japanese government might use the current
political turmoil there to its advantage in seeking U.S.
concessions in other U.S.-Japanese trade disputes.
   Proponents of the FSX project claim it represents a way to add
fighters to Japan's inventory in strategic northeast Asia at its
own expense and would give the United States access to
sophisticated radar technology developedby Mitsubishi.
   One congressional source involved in trade issues said that any
further delay in the project now would let Japan strengthen its
negotiating hand.
   ``Japan's final response on the FSX clearly had to be signed off
on by the prime minister. But there was divided counsel in Japan on
the terms and he (Takeshita) obviously has been preoccupied. This
will give them a chance to get their act together and play trade
hardball.''
   Any effort by Japan to demand further concessions from the
United States could jeopardize a project that already has thin
support in Congress, possibly torpedoing the plan entirely, said
both administration and congressional sources.
   Traveling with Bush in California, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater was asked what impact Takeshita's resignation might have
on the FSX project. ``We don't really know how it might affect that
deal,'' he said.
   Asked if the White House still favored moving ahead with the
agreement, with the new qualifications, Fitzwater said, ``Our
position is the same, we still hope so.''

<HEAD>Postal Service Cuts International Mail Rates</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs of reax.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Service slashed its price for
international express mail Tuesday in an effort to increase its
share of the business.
   Assistant Postmaster General Peter K. Eichorn announced that the
rate for express mail packages of a half-pound or less will be
$10.75 effective July 1.
   Until July 1 the agency will handle those envelopes for what he
termed an ``introductory'' price of $8.75 each.
   Currently, international express mail up to one-half pound costs
$13 to Canada, $15 to Great Britain and $18 to the nearly 100 other
nations where the high speed service is available.
   Eichhorn said that the service, which delivers parcels in one to
three days, is profitable for the Postal Service and he expected
the agency to do even better as volume increases.
   While lengthy, complex procedures are required for the Postal
Service to alter its rates for domestic mail, it has the latitude
to change international rates.
   The Postal Service carries about 7.4 percent of the 30 million
international express parcels sent annually, Eichorn said. He
predicted that volume will rise substantially with the new rates.
   International express mail is primarily used by businesses,
although Eichorn said the lower rates will also bring it within
reach of individual consumers.
   When expedited international mail was first offered in 1971 the
rate was $30 plus $1 per ounce.
   The decision was immediately criticized by UPS, a competitor.
   UPS spokesman Bob Kenney said, ``Today's announcement by the
Postal Service that it is reducing the rate on its international
express mail overnight letter to $8.75 and then to $10.75 is
another incredible example of a marketing strategy designed solely
to maximize postal volume at the expense of private enterprise
competitors.
   ``How could any company faced with rising costs and
disappointing productivity levels, as the Postal Service is,
justify a rate cut of more than 50 per cent? The answer is simply
that this service offering is not based on USPS cost factors.

<HEAD>Philips Appliance Interest Boosts Whirlpool Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whirlpool Corp.'s purchase of a
share of the appliance business of N.V. Philips boosted Whirlpool's
first-quarter earnings, the company said Tuesday.
   Whirlpool became the world's largest appliance concern in
January when it agreed to buy a 53 percent interest in the
appliance division of the Dutch company, forming a venture called
Whirlpool International.
   At Whirlpool's annual meeting Tuesday in Chicago, shareholders
elected Gerrit Jeelof, a Philips vice president and chairman of
North American Philips Corp., as a Whirlpool director.
   The Whirlpool board named Wilhemus G. Maeyer, president and
chief executive officer of Whirlpool International, as executive
vice president at Whirlpool.
   Whirlpool reported profit of $40.7 million, or 59 cents a share,
for the first quarter, up from $37.1 million, or 54 cents a share,
in the first quarter of 1988.
   Revenues for the quarter were $1.6 billion, up from $1.1 billion
in the comparable 1988 period, the company said.
   Chairman David R. Whitwam said inflation will tend to increase
materials costs during the rest of the year, however.
   European appliance sales are expected to increase 1 percent to 3
percent this year, but a U.S. economic slowdown could reduce
domestic sales 2 percent to 5 percent, he said.
   The board also elected Whitwam as president in addition to his
posts as chairman and chief executive officer. Former president
Albert E. Suter resigned April 4, saying he wanted to pursue other
business opportunities.

   Stockholders of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.
voted to changed the name of the Chicago-based company Tuesday to
Santa Fe Pacific Corp.
   The change was required by the company's sale of the Southern
Pacific Transportation Co. to Rio Grande Industries Inc. last
October.
   The company's common stock will continue to be listed on the New
York, Midwest and Pacific stock exchanges under the trading symbol
SFX.
   In addition to the Santa Fe Railroad, the company has interests
in real estate and energy.
   The company sold Southern Pacific after the Interstate Commerce
Commission disallowed the merger of its railroad unit with the
Santa Fe Railroad. The two railroad holding companies had merged in
1983 but kept the railroad operations separate pending government
action on the merger proposal.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group controlled by Canadian real
estate mogul George Mann applied Tuesday for permission from
federal regulators to acquire more than 50 percent of Dunkin'
Donuts Inc.
   Kingsbridge Capital Group said in the filing with the Federal
Trade Commission that it has already bought 7.6 percent of the
stock in the doughnut maker, which owns or franchises more than
1,780 shops.
   Kingsbridge announced April 20 that it had acquired 6.6 percent
of Dunkin' Donuts and might seek control over the Randolph,
Mass.-based company, which reported earnings of $13.5 million on
sales of $112.8 million last year.
   The group still has not decided whether to launch a takeover
bid, spokesman Eric W. Evans said Tuesday.
   ``What we're seeking is approval to acquire up to 100 percent
(of Dunkin' Donuts), but that doesn't mean we're going to do it,''
he said.
   Dunkin' Donuts Vice President Richard N. Hart Jr. said it would
vigorously resist any takeover attempt.
   Kingsbridge Capital Group is a Toronto-based merchant bank owned
by Unicorp Canada Corp., the 15th largest company in Canada with
assets of 5.9 billion Canadian dollars. Unicorp is controlled by
Mann, its chairman, who owns about 25 percent of its total stock
and 68 percent of its voting shares.
   Under U.S. antitrust laws, investors must apply for permission
to buy more than $15 million or 15 percent of the stock in large,
publicly held companies.
   Kingsbridge's purchases so far total just under $15 million, and
Evans said the group would like to exceed that figure. But he said
there is ``no current intention to acquire more than 15 percent''
of Dunkin' Donuts, the threshhold that would trigger anti-takeover
defenses.
   Dunkin' Donuts moved quickly after last week's announcement to
shore up those defenses, setting up both a ``poison pill''
shareholder rights plan and an employee stock ownership plan.
   The poison pill would give stockholders an automatic right to
purchase additional shares in the event of a takeover,
significantly boosting the cost to the buyer.
   The ESOP would put 1.1 million shares, or about 16.7 percent of
the total outstanding, into the hands of workers. Hart said Dunkin'
Donuts has begun buying back an equal number of its shares,
purchasing 300,000 so far this year.
   In addition, Hart said, Dunkin' Donuts laid off 80 of its 560
employees last Friday as part of a continuing reorganization that
began before the Kingsbridge announcement. People who work in the
stores are employees of the individual franchise owners, not the
company.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Settlement Against Company That Made Faulty Pacemakers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday approved a $764,000
settlement of criminal charges against the Cordis Corp. after the
Miami-based company pleaded guilty to selling faulty pacemakers
from 1983 to 1985.
   Last October, U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus refused to
accept fines and court costs totaling $264,000, saying the amount
was ``not commensurate with the crime charged.''
   But on Tuesday, he agreed to the new plea bargain after
prosecutors added a $500,000 count.
   Four former Cordis officers are set to go on trial here in
September on an indictment in the case, but the case Tuesday
involved the company itself, which was charged separately with 12
felony and 13 misdemeanor counts. The company sold the pacemaker
division in 1987.
   Last month in Washington, Cordis also agreed to pay $5 million
in civil penalties levied by the Veterans Administration and the
U.S. Health and Human Services Department.
   ``As far as the company is concerned, the issue is behind us,''
Cordis spokesman Chick McDowell said after Tuesday's hearing.
   Cordis was accused of selling 2,200 defective pacemakers and
6,000 batteries prone to corrosion from December 1983 to October
1985.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the pacemakers could
have stopped without warning, although no deaths were attributed to
failure of the devices, which are implanted under the skin to
regulate the heartbeat. The charges said company officials knew of
the problems but sold the pacemakers anyway.
   Cordis sold its pacemaker business to the Australian medical
device manufacturer Telectronics. Cordis now concentrates on making
catheters for diagnosing and treating heart problems and gauges for
monitoring pressure on the brain.
   The company reported a loss of $56.1 million in 1987, but a
major restructuring after the sale of the pacemaker operation
brought the company a profit in 1988 of $2.4 million on sales of
$132 million.

<TEXT>
   The Argentine currency plunged
against the dollar Tuesday, continuing an 11-week slide that has
cut its value by 82 percent, thrown business into disarray and
threatened to spark social unrest.
   The government blamed speculators and uncertainty over who will
win national elections set for May 14. Peronist candidate Carlos
Menem leads the candidate of the governing Radical Civic Union,
Eduardo Angeloz, by about seven points in public opinion polls.
   Prices for food, clothes, gas, public utilities and consumer and
business products of every type _ whether imported or not _ have
soared with the dollar's value against the austral.
   Wages have not kept pace. Saul Ubaldini, general-secretary of
the 4 million-member General Labor Confederation, calls it an
``unprecedented emergency'' and wants massive wage increases.
   The president of the Federation of Businesses in the Federal
Capital (Buenos Aires), Osvaldo Cornide, said member stores may
close down Thursday to protest the economic chaos.
   Veronica Arbos, owner of a small leather shop, said Tuesday,
``What's happening to Argentina? The exchange rate is going crazy
and there's no obvious reason for it. We're helpless. It's not
possible to do business in this climate.''
   Argentines paid 102 australs per dollar on Tuesday, up 20
australs from the close of business Monday. Tuesday's currency
devaluation of just under 20 percent followed a devaluation of
almost 12 percent from Friday to Monday.
   The austral recovered slightly to 93 or 94 per dollar by the
close of business, but was expected to open Wednesday at about
100-1.
   Third-party candidate Alvaro Alsogaray of the rightist
Democratic Center Union blames the government, which ``let the
gangrene advance and now there's no other way but to cut.'' The
former economy minister was referring to the huge budget deficit,
triple-digit inflation and non-payment of nearly $59 billion in
foreign debt.
   The national currency has slid since the Central Bank announced
on Feb. 5 it no longer would sell dollars on the open market to
prop up the austral's value and dampen inflation.
   At the close of business on Feb. 3, Argentines could buy a
dollar for 17.59 australs.
   Price increases touched off riots eight weeks ago that left more
than 270 people dead in Venezuela, on South America's northwest
coast.
   The consumer group Adelco said the price of flour increased by
53 percent last week, coffee by 80 percent, noodles by 52 percent,
cooking oil by 43 percent.
   A survey by retail trade associations indicated that eggs,
spaghetti, cheese, sugar and other products increased by at least
150 percent over the past nine weeks.
   The minimum wage is 3,500 australs a month _ about $35 at
Tuesday's exchange rate.
   The dollar is a benchmark for prices and investments, given the
triple-digit inflation Argentina has suffered for four decades. In
June 1985, the austral was worth $1.25. Today, it is worth about
one cent.
   Wealthier Argentines bought dollars with their savings to hedge
against inflation.
   Interest rates hit 80 percent a month on Tuesday as banks tried
desperately to keep investors from removing deposits to buy dollars.
   No anti-government demonstrations or looting were reported, but
police and private security guards were posted outside some
supermarkets and foreign exchange houses on Tuesday as a precaution.
   Suppliers are delivering less goods, demanding payment sooner,
and increasing financing charges. Retailers suspended credit card
service and in many cases demand payment in cash. Both worry that
sales of existing stock won't cover the cost of new merchandise.
   The Economy Ministry said Monday it will set maximum prices on
about 80 essential products, but minister Juan Carlos Pugliese
conceded, ``I cannot come up with policies which will calm peoples'
fears ... it is useless to insist that May 15 will follow May 14
and nothing (bad) will happen. No one will believe me.''
   President Raul Alfonsin, elected in October 1983 to replace a
military regime, has had little success curbing budget deficits,
spurring economic growth, and making payments on Argentina's
foreign debt.

<HEAD>Major Oil Companies Report First-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs on Sun Co. earnings.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc.'s profit soared in the first quarter, helped by a
substantial one-time gain from a major restructuring, while rising
crude prices took a toll on most of the nation's other large oil
companies.
   Mobil Corp. reported a 22 percent drop in first-quarter earnings
compared with the same 1988 period, while Chevron Corp.'s profit
was down 52 percent and Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s fell 41
percent. Shell Oil Co. said its profit slipped 7 percent.
   Texaco said its profit rose more than fivefold to $1.5 billion,
or $5.91 a share, from $270 million, or $1.11 a share, in the first
quarter of 1988.
   Texaco's first-quarter results included a net restructuring gain
of $1.2 billion, or $4.87 a share, the company said.
   The nation's third-largest oil company, based in White Plains,
N.Y., said it realized $1.3 billion from the sale of Texaco Canada
Inc. after special charges. Texaco sold its 78 percent stake in the
Canadian subsidiary to Exxon Corp. in January.
   Texaco's revenue for the first three months of the year totaled
$9.6 billion, up 10 percent from $8.7 billion in the year-ago
quarter.
   Despite the gains, Texaco's refining and marketing margins were
hurt by rising crude oil prices in the absence of a corresponding
increase in product prices, the company said. However, domestic
exploration and production results benefited from the higher crude
prices.
   Mobil, based in New York, said its first-quarter earnings fell
to $429 million, or $1.04 a share, from $549 million, or $1.33 a
share, in the comparable 1988 quarter.
   Revenue totaled $14 billion, up slightly from $13.9 billion in
last year's first quarter.
   Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray attributed the profit decline to
volatile crude prices, which resulted in a 44 percent drop in the
company's refining and marketing earnings. Exploration and
production earnings were off 22 percent. However, Murray predicted
that a continued rise in product prices, including gasoline, could
produce a turnaround in the second quarter.
   San Francisco-based Chevron reported net income of $313 million,
or 91 cents a share, down from $653 million, or $1.91 a share, in
the same period last year. Revenue totaled $7.7 billion, up from
$7.5 billion.
   Chevron Chairman Ken Derr noted that crude oil in November cost
about $13 a barrel, but had risen to $20 a barrel by the end of the
quarter. He said prices at the gas pump did not increase fast
enough to make up the difference.
   Occidental reported after-tax profit of $67 million, or 24 cents
a share, down sharply from $113 million, or 52 cents a share. Sales
were $5.1 billion, compared with $4.5 billion in 1988's first
quarter.
   The Los Angeles-based company said the 1988 results included a
net gain of $53 million from the issuance and sale of stock by one
of its subsidiaries.
   Occidental said the first-quarter results reflected the early
paydown of $9 million in debt as well as a lower crude oil sales
volume stemming from the July 1988 North Sea Piper platform
accident.
   Shell, a unit of the Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Companies based
in England and the Netherlands, said its U.S. consolidated earnings
in the quarter were $362 million, down 7 percent from $390 million
in the year-earlier period. Revenue totaled $5.2 billion, up from
$5.1 billion last year.
   Sun Co.'s earnings for the first quarter increased 35 percent,
the Radnor, Pa.-based company said, citing improved results in
domestic refining and marketing.
   Sun's profits totaled $81 million, or 76 cents a share, compared
with $60 million, or 57 cents per share, in 1988's first quarter.
Revenue totaled $2.65 billion, up from $2.39 billion.
   Excluding $16 million in earnings reported in the first quarter
of 1988 from domestic oil and gas operations that have since been
spun off to stockholders as Sun Exploration and Production Co.,
Sun's earnings increased 84 percent.

   United Airlines plans to announce Wednesday that
it is ordering 190 narrow-body jets worth $7.5 billion from Boeing
Co., according to a published report.
   United, a subsidiary of UAL Corp. of Chicago, said Tuesday it
would hold a news conference in Chicago on Wednesday to make an
important announcement, but it declined to disclose its purpose.
   The New York Times, quoting industry sources, reported in
Wednesday's editions that the airline would announce it was buying
90 Boeing 757s to be delivered starting in August 1989, and 100
Boeing 737s, of which 35 are firm orders and the rest options.
   The carrier's management said previously that it intended to
place a significant jet order.
   Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst for Solomon Brothers Inc.,
said the order was designed to counter recent major jet orders by
American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
   He added that he expected United to place another order in the
summer for wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 747 or the
McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD-11.
