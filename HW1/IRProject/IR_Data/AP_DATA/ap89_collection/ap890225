   A gaping hole ripped open on the right side of a
United Airlines jumbo jet carrying 354 people Friday, sucking nine
passengers to their death 20,000 feet above the Pacific Ocean,
authorities said.
   The pilot brought the Boeing 747 back safely for an emergency
landing at Honolulu International Airport. Two of the engines had
failed, but it wasn't clear whether the failure was connected with
the fuselage ripping open.
   ``He had to dump fuel, and then fly the return to Honolulu and
land that plane safely. We would characterize that as heroic,''
Lawrence M. Nagin, a United senior vice president, said at the
airlines' headquarters in Chicago.
   The Honolulu medical examiner's office said ``multiple small body
fragments and pieces of clothing'' were found in the one of the
right-side engines. Deputy Medical Examiner Mary Flynn said it was
not known whether the fragments were from one or more bodies.
   United said the missing passengers included six Americans, two
Australians and a New Zealander.
   Twenty-seven passengers were treated at hospitals and six were
hospitalized, including four United crew members.
   Federal aviation investigators had not determined the cause of
the hole, but were leaning toward structural failure as the
likeliest explanation. Initial reports from the pilot and some
passengers indicated they had heard an explosion.
   ``All of a sudden, I could see the sky and feel the wind,'' said
passenger Koji Yamamoto, 23, of Osaka, Japan. ``The roof was
breaking. Something was blowing toward us.''
   United's Flight 811, which originated in San Francisco and Los
Angeles, departed Honolulu International Airport with 336 passengers
and 18 crew members at 1:34 a.m. (6:34 a.m. EST) for Auckland, New
Zealand, and Sydney, Australia. It returned 59 minutes later with a
10-by-40-foot vertical hole in its right side near the front of the
craft.
   ``There is an area where there used to be a cargo door and it's
not there any more,'' said Eugene Glenn, special agent in charge of
the Honolulu FBI office. But Glenn said it was not known whether the
loss of the cargo door was a cause of the accident or a result.
   William Speicher, senior vice president for United's Pacific
Division, said at a Friday night news conference that it appeared to
him the hole started at the cargo door ``and ripped up.''
   The government last July ordered airlines to improve cargo door
lock systems on older Boeing 747s, saying the directive was
``prompted by a lower lobe forward cargo door with damaged lock
sectors that partially opened in flight.'' The summary of the
directive did not say what flight or what airline was involved.
   United spokesman Russell Mack in Chicago said the required
improvements were made to the aircraft.
   The nine missing passengers were identified as Susan Craig and
Harry Craig of Morristown, N.J.; Rose Harley of Hackensack, N.J.;
Anthony Fallon and Barbara Fallon of Long Beach, Calif.; Mary T.
Handley of Bay City, Mich.; Lee Campbell of Wellington, New Zealand;
Dr. John Michael Crawford and John Swann, both of Sydney, Australia.
   The most seriously injured of the five people hospitalized was a
48-year-old woman in guarded condition at Queen's Medical Center
with cervical and abdominal injuries.
   ``We still have no basis on which to discern whether the damage
was caused by a bomb, or whether it was structural damage caused by
some internal failure,'' said Rep. James L. Oberstar, D-Minn.,
chairman of the House aviation subcommittee after consulting with
federal officials investigating the incident.
   He said he thought the ``likeliest explanation'' for the damage
was stress failure, perhaps compounded by maintenance problems. The
ripping away of the fuselage skin appeared to have occurred along
rivet lines, he said.
   Bobbie Mardis, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman in
Oklahoma City, said records from January 1987 showed United found
cracks near the No. 3 engine, the structure that holds the engine to
the wing. The 18-year-old plane is the oldest 747 in United's jumbo
jet fleet.
   Mardis said the aircraft's history also included an engine fire
in 1986.
   But Nagin said the craft underwent a four-day complete inspection
88 days ago, and a less intensive check on Feb. 16.
   ``It has no history of maintenance problems. This aircraft had a
routine maintenance history,'' Nagin told reporters in Chicago.
   FAA spokesman John Leyden in Washington said the pilot reported
losing power in one right-side engine nine minutes after takeoff
and, after turning to Honolulu, eight minutes later radioed he had
lost power in the other right-side engine.
   United identified the pilot as David Cronin, 58, a 34-year
veteran, who is based in Los Angeles.
   The FBI sent bomb experts to the investigation, ``but a
determination of whether it was a bomb has not been made,'' said FBI
spokesman Harlan Frymire.
   Coast Guard spokesman Dennis Hubbard said two search vessels
picked up debris spotted earlier by helicopters. He said a large
piece of corrugated metal, some small pieces and an aircraft seat
cushion with an emergency procedures card attached were found in the
Pacific Ocean about 90 miles south of Honolulu. None of the debris
had been linked to Flight 811, he said.
   ``As far as I know there have been no bodies found by the Coast
Guard,'' said Nagin.
   Speicher said about 200 of the passengers from Flight 811 were
expected to board a special United flight to New Zealand on Friday.
   ``I crashed in World War II twice, and I kept flying. You just
have to,'' said John C. Tracey of San Antonio as he prepared to
board the special flight.

   A traveling President Bush and his Republican
allies in the Senate are working out details of a plan to salvage
John Tower's nomination as Defense Secretary, and Bush has already
begun lobbying from abroad.
   The plan includes the possible rare public release of material
culled from an FBI report on Tower, although Bush said in Tokyo he
was anxious to protect the confidentiality of the people who agreed
to talk to investigators.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Friday the White House is
hoping to assemble a ``sanitized'' version of the report so senators
can discuss in public the allegations against Tower and their
disposition.
   Dole said the hope is to produce ``a list of the charges and
hopefully a list of the rebuttals so the American people will know
that Charge A was answered and is gone, Charge B, etc.''
   Tower has been struggling in his nomination fight against
allegations of excessive drinking as well as womanizing, and against
an alleged conflict of interest stemming from the hundreds of
thousands of dollars he received for work as a defense industry
consultant.
   In addition, Bush, who returns Monday from a four-day Asian trip,
intends to meet individually with 10 or more Democratic senators _
many of them conservative southerners _ to seek their votes.
   ``I'll do it personally and I'll do it as forcefully as I can,''
the president told reporters.
   He said ``I will encourage people to look at the facts'' despite
the talk about perceptions of Tower's problems.
   ``That's not fair enough and that's not high enough a standard
when it comes to the confirmation of an important nominee of this
nature,'' said Bush, a personal friend of Tower for decades.
   ``So I have made some calls and I will be talking to whoever
remains open minded,'' he said. Among the Democrats to be called was
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, a fellow Texan and former Senate colleague of
Tower's.
   Bentsen said Friday he was still uncommitted.
   Tower's confirmation battle suffered a major defeat Thursday
night when the Armed Services Committee, on a strict party line roll
call, recommended 11-9 that the full Senate reject the nomination.
   Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the full Senate.
   The partisan vote breakdown in committee heightened the dispute
dramatically, transforming it into a major test of the new
Republican president's strength in a Congress controlled by
Democrats.
   Among the Democrats other than Bentsen who said Friday they
remain uncommitted on the nomination were Alabama's Howell Heflin
and Arizona's Dennis DeConcini. The three are among the most
conservative Democrats in the Senate, and have been invited to the
White House to meet with Bush next week to discuss the nomination.
   In his comments to reporters, Bush said, ``There is no fallback.
There is no option,'' and denied he was off to a late start with his
personal lobbying. ``It's not too little too late.''
   The effort to release material gleaned by the FBI's investigation
is an attempt by Republicans to prove their contention that despite
the multitude of charges made against Tower, few if any can be
corroborated.
   Release of the material would be a dramatic departure from the
normal practice. Tower's background check has been kept in a
lead-lined room on the fourth-floor of the Capitol, and senators are
required to go there to read it.
   In Tokyo, Bush said ``confidentiality is vital.'' But he added
that senators should look at the report and make up their minds on
the facts instead of perceptions.
   With a full Senate vote expected late next week, Dole gave a hint
of the bruising struggle that lies ahead when he read for reporters
high praise that Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., heaped upon Tower shortly
before the former Texas senator retired from Congress. Nunn is now
chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and led the committee
Democrats in voting against confirmation.
   Dole also said a party line vote in the Senate ``could be an end
to the honeymoon for both Georges.'' That was a shot across the bow
of Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, the new majority leader.
   But even as he said he hoped there was no ``party effort to line
up every Democrat against John Tower,'' he made it clear the issue
is one of loyalty to the administration for the Republicans.
   ``This is the president's first controversial vote and I think he
has a right to expect all of us to support him,'' he said.

   Oliver L. North's courier to Central America
says the former presidential aide told inquiring lawmakers the two
were only acquaintances despite their extensive secret dealings to
help the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Robert W. Owen, who ferried intelligence information and money
from North to Nicaraguan rebel leaders, testified that he met with
the former National Security Council aide 80 to 100 times between
1983 and 1986.
   But Owen said North reported telling lawmakers in August 1986
that ``he met me a couple of times.''
   ``He said, `I met you a couple of times. I knew you were an
activist supporting the Nicaraguan resistance,''' Owen quoted North
as telling him after being questioned by a congressional
intelligence panel.
   Owen described during a day of testimony how he worked for North
taking intelligence information, tactical guidance and and sometimes
money to the Contra leaders in Central America. But he said North
told a different story to Congress.
   Among the 12 felony charges against North are allegations that he
obstructed repeated congressional inquiries into reports in 1985 and
1986 that he was secretly helping arm the Nicaraguan rebels and
giving tactical advice despite a congressional ban.
   The former National Security Council aide and retired Marine
lieutenant colonel is accused of telling the House intelligence
committee on Aug. 6, 1986, that he was not assisting the Contras and
that Owen was only a casual acquaintance.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, the panel's former chairman who was the first
prosecution witness in the trial, testified that North told the
committee ``he was not assisting the Contras by raising money, that
he had not provided any military advice to the Contras.''
   Owen, 35, testifying under immunity from prosecution in the
Iran-Contra affair, said that on three trips to Central America he
gave Contra leaders intelligence maps that included locations of
Nicaraguan government troops and details of the Managua airport for
a ``suicide mission'' North proposed for destroying Soviet Hind
helicopters.
   Later, Owen said he helped the Contras open up the so-called
``southern front'' along the Costa Rican border, traveling to that
country at North's behest to survey possible sites for an air strip
that was eventually built to help the supply efforts.
   Owen said delivered a secret encryption communications device to
Joseph Fernandez, the CIA station chief in Costa Rica, which allowed
the sending of messages in code by telephone.
   North was careful to keep Owen's role in the resupply operations
a secret but later suggested a change in his role because ``it was
time for me to look more legitimate,'' he said.
   In October 1985, Owen went to work as a consultant for the State
Department's Nicaraguan Humanitarian Assistance Office as a
consultant.
   ``I was working in a covert operation,'' Owen said. North ``felt
it was a good idea that I be in a position that was more public,
that I not try to hide what I was doing.''
   Owen said he assured North that despite his new role ``I would be
in a position to help him.''
   North continued to seek Owen's involvement in the secret resupply
network, once asking him to fly to Honduras aboard a plane carrying
humanitarian aid that was to pick up a load of weapons for a secret
flight to another drop-off point.
   ``He said ... I would fly down on NHAO, put on my Robert Owen
private citizen hat, and fly with the ammunition,'' Owen testified.
   When Owen got to Honduras there was no ammunition to be loaded.
   Owen said he never put North's name on a stream of memos he
wrote, referring to his mentor as ``Hammer,'' ``Steel Hammer'' or
``B.G.'' The initials stood for ``Blood and Guts.''
   The memos were signed with the initials ``T.C.'' to denote Owen's
role as ``The Courier.''
   As press reports linked Owen to North, Owen wrote ``I am burned
beyond belief.''
   North then decided, in the summer of 1986, to help Owen get a job
with a non-profit institute that studied terrorism. Owen said North
helped arrange for a private donor to finance the job.

<HEAD>Darman Says Administration Has Specifics on Domestic Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget director Richard Darman says the Bush
administration is ready to provide specific details being demanded
by Congress on President Bush's budget as part of the negotiation
process the administration is trying to get started.
   Darman told reporters Friday that the administration has a
position on the proper spending level for ``almost every one'' of
the programs in the $136 billion collection of government agencies
for which the administration is seeking savings of $10 billion.
   Democratic critics have charged that the administration purposely
has left the savings in this area of non-defense programs
unspecified so that Congress will have to take the political heat
for cutting popular domestic programs.
   Darman, however, denied this assertion and said that once the
private negotiations with Congress get under way in earnest, the
administration will be willing to state what its position is.
   ``In order to get the process moving, we will have to take an
initial position,'' Darman said.
   Democrats in Congress have insisted that they want the White
House to put more details about Bush's budget on the record before
they enter into negotiations.
   But Darman said he believed this debate will soon move beyond a
call for more specifics into serious negotiations with congressional
leaders. He predicted those negotiations would start within the next
two weeks.
   ``In a context where a lot of (financial) market players and
other observers are nervous, it is foolish to do business as
usual,'' he said in an hour-long meeting with reporters.
   ``I think it will be virtually guaranteed that we will start a
process that is helpful, above and beyond the normal legislative
process,'' Darman said.
   Darman met again Friday with top Democrats and Republicans from
the congressional budget committees as part of a series of sessions
in which lawmakers have been seeking specific figures about the
spending Bush proposes.
   In the meeting with reporters, Darman rejected the argument that
Bush's $1.16 trillion budget was based on a strategy that will allow
Bush to take credit for popular spending increases and blame
Congress for the painful cuts needed to meet the 1990 deficit target
of $100 billion. The administration estimates the deficit in the
current fiscal year will be $170 billion.
   Taking note of the decision by the Federal Reserve Board to boost
its discount rate Friday to 7 percent, Darman said the action should
prod both congressional leaders and the administration to enter into
serious negotiations to calm fears in financial markets of a
stalemate that would keep federal borrowing demands from declining.
   In Congress, Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Budget Committee, agreed.
   Panetta said the discount rate increase should serve as a
``wake-up call'' to lawmakers and administration officials, showing
the ``urgency of the need to cut out the political gamesmanship and
adopt a bold and realistic budget plan.''
   Darman disputed an argument advanced by Senate Budget Committee
chairman, Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., that Democrats who support
higher domestic spending than in the Bush budget might be better off
simply allowing across-the-board spending cuts to take effect.
   These spending cuts would be triggered if Congress and the
administration fail to agree on a budget with a deficit of $100
billion. Sasser said earlier this week that the automatic cuts would
result in spending about $10 billion less than Bush wants for the
military and about $10 billion more for domestic programs.
   However, Darman gave out projections from the Bush budget office
showing that discretionary domestic spending would be $4.1 billion
higher under the Bush budget than if the spending cuts take effect
while defense spending would be $15.1 billion below the level in the
Bush budget.
   ``Everybody recognizes that (automatic cuts) are highly
undesirable from the standpoint of defense and national security,''
Darman said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights advocates are criticizing Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh's choice of William Lucas, a black lawyer,
to head the Justice Department's civil rights division, saying the
key job needs someone with more experience.
   ``We're terribly disappointed,'' said Julius Chambers, the
director-counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People's Legal Defense Fund.
   Lucas, a Democrat-turned-Republican who ran unsuccessfully for
the governorship of Michigan in 1986, was recommended Friday by
Thornburgh to President Bush to become assistant attorney general in
charge of the civil rights division.
   Currently in private practice in Detroit, Lucas is a former New
York City policeman, FBI agent, Wayne County, Mich., sheriff and
Wayne County executive. He was born in Harlem, graduated in 1952
from Manhattan College, and in 1961 from Fordham University's law
school.
   Lucas, 61, worked for the civil rights division in 1961-1962,
representing the Justice Department in Tuskegee, Ala., during the
desegregation of the local schools, the department said. In
addition, he helped compile information on barriers to black voting,
material presented to Congress during its consideration of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965.
   If nominated by Bush, he would be subject to Senate confirmation.
   ``Bill Lucas has a longstanding commitment to the civil rights
movement and a record of strong and fair law enforcement,''
Thornburgh said in a statement. ``These factors, I believe, make him
an outstanding nominee for the sensitive position of ensuring that
the civil rights laws of our nation are equally and fairly
enforced.''
   But that's not the way civil rights advocates saw it Friday.
   ``We had hoped that the attorney general ... would try to pick
someone who had some experience with civil rights litigation and had
some sympathy and appreciation for the struggle that black people
have been going through over the years, and that we would not be
back with the same type of confrontation that we've had during the
past eight years,'' Chambers said.
   William Taylor of the Citizens Commission on Civil Rights said
Lucas ``appears to have a little bit of civil rights experience, but
it seems to go back a long way, before the enactment of major civil
rights laws. He doesn't have major identification among civil rights
leaders and organizations as someone with a real background in civil
rights.''
   That Lucas is black did not allay any of his concerns, he said.
   ``We're past the era, I think, when an administration earns
plaudits simply by appointing a minority person to a job,'' Taylor
said.
   Said Ted Shaw of the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund office in Los
Angeles: ``Just because he's a black Republican doesn't mean he's
qualified for this job.''
   Bush has said he wants civil rights policy to be different from
that followed by former President Reagan, whose civil rights
division came under intense fire from civil rights groups.
   William Bradford Reynolds, who headed the civil rights division
during the Reagan administration, helped formulate and direct the
Reagan administration's efforts challenging affirmative action
hiring quotas. He also moved to overturn court-ordered busing
programs and to restrict federal guarantees concerning women's
rights and the rights of the mentally ill and disabled.
   Pat Korten, a conservative who served as Justice Department
spokesman during the Reagan administration, said the choice of Lucas
was ``not only a good choice, but it's politically very smart.''
   ``I think it will please conservatives who have long thought
highly of Lucas and thought of him as someone who should be given a
role of some prominence in a Republican administration and somebody
who can symbolize the party's desire to bring into its fold blacks
with a strong law-and-order record,'' he said.
   The reaction from Patrick McGuigan of the Free Congress
Foundation, a strongly conservative group, also was positive.
   ``This is a brilliant appointment,'' he said.
   The only black who has ever held the civil rights division job is
Drew S. Days III, who was the assistant attorney general in charge
of that division during the Carter administration.

<HEAD>Energy Department Admits Flaws in Nuclear Cleanup Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department has acknowledged publicly
for the first time that it misjudged both the cost and relative
urgency of hazardous waste cleanup requirements at its 15 nuclear
weapons plants.
   The miscalculations stemmed from a partially flawed computer
model the department used to decide which of 156 environmental
problems at the plants were most severe, Ray Berube, the deputy
assistant secretary for environment, said Friday.
   He told a House Armed Services subcommittee the cleanup will
likely exceed the official $63 billion, and the ranking of hazards
will have to be revised. The rankings are important because they
help determine the timing and scope of environmental cleanup at the
various sites, which are owned by the Energy Department.
   He said the Rocky Flats weapons plant near Golden, Colo., which
was judged the most urgent priority for environmental cleanup in the
preliminary December report, probably will get a lower ranking when
the final survey is completed later this year. He did not say which
site might replace Rocky Flats at the top of the list.
   He also did not say by how much the cleanup cost at the 12-state
nuclear weapons complex would exceed $63 billion.
   Berube said the errors were caused in part by haste, since his
agency decided to speed up its orginal timetable for assessing the
environmental problems because of public pressure to explain how the
wastes would be cleaned up.
   ``We did not have the time to subject that (computer) model to a
public review,'' Berube said. ``I wish we had. The model does need
some improvements.''
   The department says none of the waste _ including toxic organic
compounds such as methylene chloride and radioactive gases such as
tritium _ poses a threat to public health and safety, but that it
might if it is not cleaned up soon.
   An environmental organization, the Natural Resources Defense
Council, testified at the House hearing that the computer model was
``riddled with flaws'' and that in some cases the department made up
data used in the model when the information was not readily
available.
   Jim Werner, an engineer with the council, said the computer model
was ``incapable of indicating which environmental problems should be
addressed in the next few years compared to those that will need
attention several decades from now.''
   ``Given the serious flaws in DOE's rankings, the department's
proposed cleanup budget is also highly suspect,'' said Dan W.
Reicher, an attorney for the environmental group.
   Berube said it was not yet possible for the department to make a
firm estimate of cleanup costs for the weapons plants because not
enough is known about the extent of damage to the environment caused
by four decades of bomb making.
   ``There's a strong chance that these costs will go higher'' than
$63 billion, he said, adding that projected costs would rise as more
information about the scope and nature of soil and groundwater
contamination becomes available.
   Key elements of the weapons complex, including parts of the
Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, the Hanford Reservation in
Washington state, and the Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado, have been
closed down in recent months because of safety and technical
problems.

   Vice President Dan Quayle says many of the
changes occurring in the Soviet Union and among its communist
neighbors can be traced to the ``profound impact'' of the defeat of
Soviet forces in Afghanistan.
   In a speech Friday night to the Conservative Political Action
Conference, Quayle said: ``Look at Hungary, where the seeds of
political pluaralism seem to be sprouting.
   ``Look at Poland, where the government is negotiating with
Solidarity.
   ``Look at the ferment of the Baltic states.
   ``And look at the new outspokenness throughout the Soviet Union
itself.''
   He then asked: ``Can it be just a coincidence that all these
remarkable events are taking place at the very same time that the
Soviet Union is reeling from its defeat in Afghanistan? I think
not.''
   The vice president also used his speech to try and assure
conservative activists, often at odds with George Bush, that the new
president would follow in the path of Ronald Reagan.
   ``Those who think that the George Bush, who served at Ronald
Reagan's side for eight years, who worked with him to turn this
country around, will somehow change colors now that he's president _
those people couldn't be more mistaken,'' said Quayle.
   ``The revolution of low taxes, a strong defense, less regulation,
support for freedom fighters and a commitment to moral values that
began in 1981, will continue under the leadership of George Bush
into the 1990s,'' he added.
   But Quayle stopped short of giving the conservatives one pledge
they want _ a commitment the administration will seek military aid
for the Contra rebels fighting to overthrow the leftist government
of Nicaragua.
   He quoted Bush as pledging support for the Contras and said:
``We're going to do what has to be done. ... We're going to have to

   A jury has been picked and sent home for the
weekend pending opening arguments Monday in the trial of suspected
hijacker Fawaz Younis.
   The case tests a 1984 law giving the United States jurisdiction
in incidents involving American hostages abroad.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr. asked prospective jurors
whether they had ever been victims of air piracy or had any links
with the Middle East.
   About half the 57 prospective jurors stood up when asked whether
any had heard of the case, in which Younis allegedly led a band of
armed men that seized a Royal Jordanian airliner in Beirut in June
1985. No one was killed in the hijacking.
   The jury, plus four women alternates, went home for the weekend
under strict instructions from Robinson to discuss the case with no
one, including ``your preacher,'' and to avoid media coverage of the
trial.
   In September 1987, Younis was arrested by federal agents who
lured him to a two-masted sailing yacht off the coast of Cyprus in
the Mediterranean Sea with the promise of a drug deal and a party,
according to pretrial evidence and documents.
   Younis was transferred successively to a Navy ammunition ship,
the USS Butte, and a carrier, the USS Saratoga, then flown non-stop
to Andrews Air Force base near Washington.
   The statute under which Younis is being tried was passed in 1984
to give the United States jurisdiction in cases involving American
hostages abroad. Domestic hostage-takers have been convicted under
the statute, but no one besides Younis has been charged with an
overseas hijacking and prosecuted under it.
   The chief prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ramsey Johnson,
told the court he planned to call as witnesses six FBI agents, two
Navy doctors and four passengers from the jetliner.
   Defense attorney Francis D. Carter said he would call as
witnesses two federal agents and Helena Cobban, a scholar on the
Middle East. He indicated during a pretrial hearing Wednesday he
will call Younis to the stand.
   Younis, 29, a Shiite Moslem from Lebanon, faces life imprisonment
if convicted.
   Bearded, with brown hair and brown eyes, Younis appeared in the
courtroom wearing a light gray sweater and a tie. Throughout the
proceedings, he smiled and joked with an Arab-language translator
supplied by the court.
   The defense counsel said at a pretrial hearing he would argue
that his client seized control of the airplane under orders from the
Amal militia to which he belonged. The Amal is a Shiite Moslem
faction in Lebanon.
   Evidence against Younis includes a videotape of him on the tarmac
at Beirut airport announcing that the Boeing 727 aircraft would be
blown up. No one was killed in the 39-hour ordeal, which ended when
the airplane was destroyed after being evacuated.
   During the trial, expected to last at least two weeks, federal
officials will be seeking to limit disclosure of details of the
elaborate clandestine operation in which Younis was captured.

<HEAD>Jury Denies Award to Wounded Burglar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors deliberated 19 minutes before rejecting a
confessed burglar's claim for damages against a man who shot him
during his getaway.
   ``We felt we shouldn't reward a burglar,'' jury foreman Vernon P.
Reeves said after the decision was announced in Dade County Court.
   The lawsuit was brought by 19-year-old Fordiran Gonzalez against
Jack B. Lentz, who lived next door to the scene of an August 1987
burglary in Miami. Lentz fired three warning shots, one of which hit
the fleeing Gonzalez in the back.
   The bullet tore through Gonzalez's intestines and went out his
side. The resulting medical bills totaled $8,622.
   Gonzalez admitted taking part in the burglary, and pleaded no
contest to charges in juvenile court. He was ordered to serve 200
hours of community service.
   The youth hung his head in silence when the lawsuit verdict was
read Thursday.
   ``I wish they'd at least paid the bill,'' he said.
   But Judge Philip Bloom said he thought the jurors reached the
right conclusion.
   ``This is a case of chutzpah,'' he said. ``This case highlights
our mixed-up world, in which the admitted criminal seems to have
more rights than an innocent victim. ... This jury verdict affirms
that a burglar is not entitled to safe passage during and after the
commission of that crime.''
   Lentz was originally charged with aggravated battery and culpable
negligence after the shooting. While the charges were later dropped,
he said 17 months of criminal and civil court battles have raised
second thoughts about pulling the trigger.
   If confronted again by burglars, Lentz said, ``I'd have to think
twice about what I'd do. I don't know if I'd get involved.''

<HEAD>United Plane Was under Orders for Cargo Door Modification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Air Lines 747 that lost nine
passengers when a cargo door and section of fuselage blew away over
the Pacific Ocean was one of a group of older Boeing jets under
order to modify the lock system on their cargo doors.
   Failure of the door was one of several possibilities
investigators were exploring today as cause for the gaping hole in
United Flight 811 when it returned to Honolulu after taking off on a
flight to Auckland, New Zealand.
   Other possibilities included structural failure, an engine
problem that sent parts flying into the fuselage or a bomb.
   A July 1, 1988, ``airworthiness directive'' from the Federal
Aviation Administration gave airlines with 156 of the early jumbo
jets from 30 to 90 days to conduct inspections and any necessary
repairs, depending on the type of door lock they have. They were
also given from 18 to 24 months to make modifications to improve the
door lock system.
   United public relations officials did not return a call late
Friday to inquire whether the damaged airliner's cargo doors had
been inspected or whether the ordered alteration had been made on
that or other United 747s. The airline would have had at least
another 10 months to make the improvement.
   United spokesman Lawrence Nagin said earlier the airliner had a
routine maintenance history.
   The 18-year-old plane is the oldest 747 in United's jumbo jet
fleet and the 89th 747 built by Boeing, which has produced 712 of
the aircraft in various versions since 1969.
   A Boeing spokesman, Randy Harrison, said the United plane had
57,793 flying hours and 14,849 takeoffs and landings that involved
pressurizing the cabin. ``We don't consider those high numbers,'' he
said.
   A 14-member National Transportation Safety Board team was
conducting investigation into the cause, with assistance from the
FAA, United, Boeing and the FBI.
   The July FAA directive, was ``prompted by a lower lobe forward
cargo door with damaged lock sectors that partially opened in
flight,'' a summary of the directive said.
   ``This condition, if not corrected, could result in the opening
of a lower lobe cargo door in flight which could result in rapid
depressurization of the airplane,'' it said.
   FAA spokesman Mitch Barker in Seattle said he didn't have the
technical expertise to say whether a cargo door opening in flight
could cause a hole to be ripped in the plane's fuselage.
   The cargo door incident that brought the order was on a Pan
American flight in March 1987, said Paul Turk of Avmark, an aviation
appraisal firm that keeps track of airliners throughout the world.
   Turk said, after examining photographs and videotape of the
airliner, he would expect to see scorch marks on the fuselage and
luggage if a bomb had gone off, and there were none visible in the
photographs. But he said it would take careful inspection to
determine the cause.
   Chris Witkowski of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, which
represents airline passengers, said if it is a cargo door problem,
it is ``a bad omen'' for safety in the industry because it raises a
maintenance problem the airline industry dealt with after a fatal
crash near Paris in 1974.
   That crash killed more than 350 people aboard a Turkish Air DC10,
and was the world's worst air disaster up to the time it occurred.
The cargo door popped off in flight, depressurizing the aircraft,
buckling the airliner floor and breaking wires and cables needed to
control the plane.
   Boeing spokesman Harrison said the structure of Boeing aircraft
is ``triple redundant safe'' and because of its design that the
United plane was able to return to Honolulu despite the gaping hole
in its side.

<HEAD>Bush Maintains Disagreement With Fed Is One of Economic ``Interpretation''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said today that he and Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan may disagree about the
``interpretation'' of economic indicators but both men agree on the
need to reduce the federal budget deficit.
   ``We've got a little difference of interpretation at this point
as to how you read the indicators on inflation, and that's the only
difference we've got,'' Bush said in response to questions at an
early morning news conference before leaving Tokyo.
   ``We share the common objectives of needing to get the deficit
down,'' Bush said. ``And I still maintain we are not far apart.''
   Questions about differing views of the economy between Bush and
Greenspan arose anew Friday after the Fed dramatically escalated its
fight against inflation by raising its key bank lending rate to the
highest level in three years. The Fed acted to dampen upward
pressure on prices.
   The move was seen as a repudiation of recent Bush administration
claims that price increases haven't been serious enough to warrant
higher interest rates. Private analysts said the move was long
overdue and should have been stronger.
   The central bank raised the discount rate, the fee it charges for
short-term loans to member banks, from 6.5 percent to 7 percent. The
action was approved on a 6-1 vote with board member Martha Seger
dissenting.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze,
taking a page from U.S. diplomacy, sought this week to establish the
Soviet Union as an impartial broker between Arabs and Israelis.
   In doing so, Shevardnadze abandoned the tough anti-Israeli
rhetoric that was the hallmark of past Kremlin diplomacy in the
region and won the endorsement of Jordan and Egypt _ Arab moderates
traditionally close to Washington.
   The Soviet initiative poses a challenge to the administration of
President Bush, who denied he was being outflanked by Moscow's new
good-guy approach.
   Bush countered the Soviet moves by meeting in Tokyo with
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, President Chaim Herzog of Israel
and King Hussein of Jordan.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III suggested the Soviets were
engaged in ``rhetorical exercises.'' He said there were ``some
opportunities'' to be explored, but that the United States was not
yet prepared to undertake new initiatives.
   What lent credibility to Shevardnadze's efforts was his ability
to establish an indirect dialogue between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization, the most intractable Middle East
adversaries.
   He managed to seat PLO Chief Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens on the same couch on the same day for lengthy
but separate talks at the Nile-side Soviet Embassy. Both agreed the
Soviets could be useful intermediaries.
   Afterward, Arens announced that a series of talks had been
arranged to pursue peace prospects. He said the Soviets had a role
to play in influencing radical Arab states such as Syria, which has
opposed a negotiated settlement.
   Arafat declared that indirect negotiations already had begun with
Shevardnadze briefing Arafat on his talks with Arens and planning to
report back to the Israelis on the PLO's positions.
   Shevardnadze has embarked on a risky policy on which he has
staked Soviet prestige. Its failure could signal that the new
white-hat image masks weakness and could mean there is skepticism
about the Soviets' ability to deliver the goods.
   The choice of Cairo as the focus for the diplomatic initiative
appeared calculated to show the Soviets had regained their position
in the Middle East and could once again play on a field that for the
past decade has been exclusively American.
   It was here that the United States achieved its greatest Middle
East success, the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty, and the Soviets
suffered their greatest setback _ expulsion of 21,000 Soviet
advisers in July 1972 and the loss of the largest Arab state as an
ally.
   Shevardnadze, echoing former President Reagan's ``trust but
verify'' proposal for arms reduction, offered guarantees to underpin
an eventual peace settlement, including a new idea for on-site
inspections to prevent military buildups.
   ``We see no reason why the parties to a future Arab-Israeli
settlement could not engage in mutual inspections and on-site
monitoring, including short notice suspect-site inspections,'' he
said.
   Shevardnadze, saying he was engaged in ``an act of creative
work,'' signaled that spontaneity and imagination would be central
to the Soviet approach _ a major change from the ponderous and
inflexible diplomacy of the pre-Gorbachev era.
   Underscoring the point, Shevardnadze _ much like a U.S.
politician _ let himself be buttonholed on doorsteps by reporters
and seemed to enjoy the repartee of such informal encounters.
   In all his public statements, Shevardnadze's rhetoric was
striking for its absence of verbal poison. There were even touches
of humility.
   In a speech to Egyptian politicians, for example, he argued that
the Middle East was headed for war if peace talks could not be
arranged and added:
   ``All this is not being said in order to give moral lessons. We
are, one might say, speaking from experience, knowing what are the
results of confrontation, dogmatic thinking and unduly ideologizing
international relations.''
   His warnings to Israel were veiled, but the message was clear and
unchanged from the days before the Soviet policy of glasnost: It was
``imperative'' that Israel accept dialogue with the PLO and agree to
the Soviet proposal for an international conference.
   He said Israel would be isolated if it refused, and hinted that
obstinancy could result in economic sanctions.
   ``Unless such an approach is taken, complications may arise in
relations between the Middle East and most of the rest of the
world,'' he said.
   Despite the promise of another Arens-Shevardnadze meeting, one
major question that threatened the Soviet pursuit of the Middle East
matchmaker role was whether Israel would continue to answer Soviet
summonses.
   Israel had hoped the Soviets would restore full diplomatic
relations, severed after the 1967 Middle East war. But Shevardnadze
linked this to Israel's acceptance of the PLO and participation in
an international peace conference.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel then restated his
nation's pre-Cairo position that the Soviets cannot play a role in
negotiations without normal relations with Israel.

   Newman races sports cars about six months a year. When he isn't

was expected to announce her retirement from racing this weekend.
   She reportedly is retiring to devote time to more lucrative
pursuits off the track. Griffith-Joyner already has signed several
commercial endorsements worth more than $1 million and has received
numerous other offers that could be worth millions more.
   ``Flo-Jo,'' as newspapers tagged her, is probably best known for
her performance at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea,
where she won three gold medals and one silver medal and shattered
the world record for the 200-meter dash.

   Steven Stayner is steeling himself for the
inevitable return of the reporters when a television miniseries airs
about his seven years as a childhood kidnapping victim.
   ``I just want to get it over with,'' Stayner said recently. ``As
soon as the movie comes out, the reporters will come back. It will
never go away.''
   Stayner, now 23, was snatched from a street in this central
California farming community on Dec. 4, 1972, when he was 7.
   More than seven years later, his case suddenly became one of the
most publicized kidnappings ever when he and another missing boy,
5-year-old Timothy White, walked into a police station in Ukiah, 150
miles north of Merced.
   A drifter, Kenneth Parnell, was later convicted of kidnapping and
spent five years in prison.
   Stayner's story, a two-part miniseries titled ``I Know My First
Name is Steven,'' is scheduled to run on NBC in May.
   The film is being made with Stayner's cooperation, and he has
agreed to join a publicity tour for Lorimar Productions, which is
making the film.
   ``I don't mind talking about the movie,'' said Stayner. Referring
to his kidnapping, he said, ``It was a terrible experience, but
let's not get overdramatic about it.''

<HEAD>Bush Says Positive Elements Exist For Solution Of Mideast Conflict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Saturday that recent
developments in the Middle East present an opportunity for resolving
the 40-year Arab-Israeli conflict, but he cautioned against hasty
U.S. mediation moves.
   Bush said his discussions here with three Mideastern leaders _
Jordan's King Hussein and presidents Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and
Chaim Herzog of Israel _ focused on how best to take advantage of
the changes in the region.
   ``We discussed what new opportunities may exist ... to take
advantage of the positive elements in the current situation,'' Bush
said at a news conference before leaving for China.
   ``I made clear the continuing readiness of the United States to
facilitate this effort in a manner that's consistent with the
security of Israel and the security of our Arab friends in the
region as well,'' Bush said.
   The positive developments Bush listed include the acceptance by
Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, of
Israel's right to exist and his renunciation of terrorism. Arafat's
concessions led the United States to launch a dialogue last December
with the previously banned organization.
   The 14-month Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied
territories has led to ``a recognition on the part of Israel ...
that something needs to be done,'' Bush added.
   ``And I think there's a readiness on the part of other Arab
states to get serious about negotiation and discussions,'' he said.
   Egypt's return to the fold of the Arab world could also serve as
an important catalyst for peace moves, Bush said.
   ``All these are ingredients that I think offer opportunity,'' he
said.
   But he cautioned that ``before we just go rushing out to do
something for the sake of doing something, we take a step that is
prudent.''
   After all, he said, ``I've been in this job for one month, and
this problem has been there for year, after year, after year.''

   The airline has 15 days to respond to the civil penalty. The
proposed fine amounts to a settlement offer from the FAA which will
take effect if the airline does not object. The FAA said it first
outlined the alleged violations in a Feb. 17 letter to Northwest
President John F. Horn
   William Slattery, Northwest executive vice president for
operations, described the problems as primarily ``instances of
inadequate record keeping and differences in interpretation.''

<HEAD>Former U.S. Senator, ``Rock-Ribbed Republican,'' Dead at 88</HEAD>

   Former Sen. Norris Cotton, who earned a
reputation as a laconic, fiercely independent and conscientious
Yankee statesman in three decades in Congress, has died of pneumonia
at age 88.
   Cotton, who called himself a ``rock-ribbed conservative and proud
of it,'' died Friday at his home, said Jane Bassick, a spokeswoman
for Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover.
   ``He embodied the substance and character of the state and people
he served for so many years,'' said Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H. ``The
death of Norris Cotton marks the passage of a great New Hampshire
statesman and the end of an era.''
   Gov. Judd Gregg ordered state flags lowered to half-staff in
memory of Cotton, who he said ``represented the best of Yankee
statesmanship.''
   Former President Nixon called Cotton ``one of my closest friends
in Washington'' in a statement issued from his home in Saddle Brook,
N.J.
   Cotton and Nixon became friends when both were sworn in as
freshman representatives in 1946.
   Cotton went to the Senate in 1954 after winning an election to
fill the two remaining years of the late Sen. Charles Tobey's term.
   On Aug. 4, 1974, the day Nixon resigned the presidency, Cotton
was among those the president phoned to say goodbye.
   ``It was the saddest day of my life,'' Cotton recalled. But he
said he was relieved Nixon had quit and saved him the agony of
judging his friend in a Senate impeachment. Cotton's first vote as a
senator had been a vote to censure Sen. Joseph McCarthy.
   Cotton retired from the Senate in 1974, but returned for about
six weeks the following year while voters settled a disputed
election.
   The Warren native came from a poor family, and paid for his
education at Phillips Exeter Academy, Connecticut's Wesleyan
University and George Washington University Law School by waiting on
tables, washing dishes and working as a bellhop in the summer.
   Cotton began his political career at age 22 when he was elected
to the state House of Representatives. He later served as a
prosecutor, judge and speaker of the New Hampshire House.
   Cotton's political headquarters was the Lebanon fire house, which
he called his ``club.'' There, he'd play cribbage and chat with a
steady stream of farmers, businessmen, workers and bankers.
   Cotton's first wife, Ruth, died at age 85 in 1978 after 51 years
of marriage. They had no children.
   In 1980, Cotton married Eleanor Coolidge Brown, his longtime
housekeeper, who survives him.

<HEAD>Board Denies Parole To Man Called Innocent In `Thin Blue Line'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man whose conviction for the slaying of a
policeman was questioned in the movie ``The Thin Blue Line'' has
been refused a parole request despite a state judge's strong backing.
   Citing the nature of the crime and use of a weapon in it, the
state Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 2-1 on Friday to deny
parole for Randall Dale Adams.
   Friday's decision means Adams, who was convicted for the 1976
slaying of Dallas policeman Robert Wood, will remain imprisoned even
though his initial accuser _ David Ray Harris _ has recanted and
virtually confessed to the crime.
   Adams' attorney, Randy Schaffer of Houston, criticized the parole
board's decision, saying he was tired of ``having to apologize to
him (Adams) and his mother for the lack of justice in Texas.''
   He said the board routinely paroles convicted killers who have
served fractions of their sentences but is ``absolutely unable to
respond to the case of an innocent man.''
   ``If you put all of that together, what they mean is because
David Harris killed Robert Wood with a gun, then Randall Adams is
denied parole,'' Schaffer said. ``I think their action today
demonstrates why they're the most disrespected parole board in the
country.''
   The parole board scheduled Adams' next review for December 1990.
   Prison officials said Adams could not accept outside calls nor
could he return phone messages.
   The board decided to conduct a special review of the case after
state District Judge Larry Baraka of Dallas recommended to the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals that Adams receive a new trial or be set
free.
   In December, Baraka recommended a new trial for the 40-year-old
Adams, saying his first trial was unfair because of inadequate
defense attorneys. Baraka, who conducted a three-day hearing on the
matter, also questioned the credibility of witnesses who testified
against Adams.
   The Court of Criminal Appeals may take as long as two years to
act on Baraka's recommendation.
   Baraka also had written to the parole board, urging members to
grant Adams parole.
   The Adams case was the subject of the Errol Morris documentary,
``The Thin Blue Line,'' which strongly suggested that Adams was
innocent of the slaying.
   The documentary accused authorities of railroading Adams and
questioned the credibility of the witnesses against him. Morris was
at work on a film in Detroit Friday and could not be reached for
comment.
   Harris, who was 16 at the time of the Wood murder, said in the
1977 trial he was a passenger in the car when Adams killed Wood, who
had pulled them over.
   But Harris said at the hearing conducted by Baraka that Adams did
not commit the slaying. Harris _ now on death row for the 1985
murder of a Beaumont, Texas, man _ provided so many details about
the crime that Baraka declared his testimony a virtual confession.

<HEAD>Youth Charged as Juvenile in Shooting of Parents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old boy was charged as a
juvenile with murder and attempted murder after police said he
fatally shot his mother and wounded his father with a hunting rifle.
   Matthew Nupp apparently argued with his mother about problems he
had at school earlier Friday before he used the .22-caliber rifle to
shoot the woman once in the head and twice in the side, police
spokesman Sgt. Harry Geehreng said.
   The seventh-grader then chased his father, who arrived home early
from work, out the back door of their suburban Washington, D.C.,
home, firing repeatedly and striking him three times, said Geehreng.
The father, James T. Nupp, 45, went back into the kitchen to
telephone police before he collapsed outside the home, said police.
   The youth holed up inside the house for an hour before
surrendering to heavily-armed police, Geehreng said. His 7-year-old
brother and a 3-year-old child staying at the house at the time of
the shootings were unharmed.
   Geehreng said Evelyn E. Nupp, 45, was dead at the scene. James
Nupp, was listed in fair condition at Suburban Hospital, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   The boy was held at a juvenile detention facility Friday night,
police said.
   Geehreng said the boy had apparently gotten into trouble Friday
at Parkland Junior High School in Rockville, Md., and was arguing
with his mother when he began firing the bolt-action rifle, one of
three guns the family kept.
   According to Geehreng, James Nupp told police he believed the
rifle, a second hunting rifle and a shotgun he owned had been locked
in the attic.
   Neighbors describe the 12-year-old as a quiet boy who rode his
bicycle in the neighborhood and joined his family on camping trips.
The Nupps were ``a very close-knit family,'' said neighbor Jean
Bowen.

<HEAD>Eds: Recasts lead to show Bush had once had doubts about attending
a Hirohito, sted saying he would have refused to go.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said that 45 years ago, he would not
have believed it possible that he would attend the funeral of
Emperor Hirohito, but said he came to Japan to show he harbors no
bitterness about World War II.
   ``I can't say that in the quiet of the ceremony that my mind
didn't go back to the wonder of it all,'' Bush told a news
conference. ``I vividly remember the personal friends that were in
our squadron that are no longer alive ... but my mind didn't dwell
on that at all.''
   Bush, the youngest pilot in the Navy when he was commissioned,
was shot down by Japanese gunners on Sept. 2, 1944, during a bombing
attack on Chichi Jima. His two crew members were killed and he was
rescued by a passing American submarine.
   ``What I really thought was .. isn't it miraculous what has
happened since the war,'' Bush said.
   Gen. Douglas MacArthur's decision not to prosecute Hirohito for
war crimes ``proved to be correct in terms of Japan's move towards
democracy,'' Bush said.
   There had been criticism of Bush for attending the funeral of
Hirohito, the last of the World War II leaders to die.
   ``I was certain from the day that I committed to come here that
this was correct for the United States. And perhaps, having been in
combat in World War II, maybe the decision was more correct, maybe
it was more profound to be here,'' he said.
   ``We're talking about a friend, we're talking about an ally,'' he
said.
   Bush conceded that if someone had told him 45 years ago, when
there was such ``hard feeling'' about the Japanese leader, that he
would be attending Hirohito's funeral, ``I would have said no way.
But here we are...''
   ``There's a very good lesson for civilized countries in all
this,'' Bush said.

   Steve Garrett didn't have a name for
the new parakeet until the bird alerted his sleeping owners to a
fire downstairs. Now, ``Smokey'' fills the bill.
   ``That bird put three smoke detectors to shame,'' Garrett, 30,
said after the fire early Thursday.
   The fire apparently started in an electrical box in the basement,
fire officials said. The parakeet screeched loudly enough from its
first-floor cage to awaken Garrett, who was sleeping upstairs.
   ``I sat up in bed and smelled the smoke,'' said Garrett, 30. ``I
went to see where the fire was. The smoke was so thick that you
couldn't see your hand in front of your face.''
   Garrett awakened his wife Vickie, 18, and they escaped with their
three children and the parakeet. One of the three smoke detectors in
the house began sounding, but not until after firefighters arrived.
   ``He went out as the kids went out and I threw him down (in his
cage) on the porch and kept going with the kids,'' Garrett said,
adding that the bird survived the cold.
   ``We named him Smokey,'' Garrett said. ``He gets anything he
wants. We'll buy him a bigger cage. Maybe we will buy him a
firefighter's suit.''

   Debbie Hoobler made it to the hospital
just in time to give birth to a girl, but the closest she got to the
delivery room was an elevator.
   ``We just knew it (the baby) was coming quick,'' Mrs. Hoobler
said after giving birth Friday in the elevator at Greenville
Regional Hospital in this northwestern Pennsylvania town. ``I really
didn't have much warning.''
   Mrs. Hoobler had been having contractions for 90 minutes. When
she and her husband, David, reached the hospital after a 15-minute
drive from their home in Stoneboro, they decided to bypass the
hospital's admitting and emergency rooms and go directly to the
second-floor delivery room.
   However, the elevator went down instead of up _ to the basement.
   The baby was born on the way down.
   ``We just got to the hospital, and I said I had to lay down, and
that's where we were, in the elevator,'' said Mrs. Hoobler, who has
five boys ranging in age from 2 to 9.
   The only other person in the elevator was a hospital employee who
is not on the medical staff.
   Hoobler delivered the baby, an 8-pound, 10-ounce girl.
   ``My husband was really good. It didn't bother him at all,'' Mrs.
Hoobler said. ``He had seen all our other babies born. He just went
into action and just did what he had to do.''

<TEXT>
   Archeologists say the torso of a centaur
found on the steep hillside of the ancient Acropolis is part of the
curved frieze block that adorned the Parthenon temple.
   The 2-foot-high headless torso was discovered last week by a crew
cleaning the hill, archeologist Constantinos Tsakos said Friday.
   Archeologists classified the sculpture of the mythical half-man,
half-horse as part of the battle of centaurs frieze adorning the
south side of the 5th century B.C. temple.
   Major parts of the frieze are displayed at the British Museum in
London, acquired in 1816 from British statesman Thomas Bruce, earl
of Elgin.
   The Parthenon, being restored in a 10-year project that began in
1985, was decorated with superb sculptures by Pheidias.

<TEXT>
   Four men were arrested in ``Operation Polar
Cap,'' the continuing federal investigation of a $1 billion cocaine
money-laundering network, authorities said.
   The four San Jose men arrested Friday allegedly helped make cash
deposits of less than $10,000 to banks to evade banking law
requiring that transactions of $10,000 or more be reported to the
Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. attorney's office said.
   Johnny Elias Chawi, 34; Emil Youssel Chawi, 45; Sadir Mouaflack
ajmeh, 32, and Leon Elovits, 38, pleaded innocent in U.S. District
Court to charges they engaged in illegal currency transactions.
   The arrests followed investigations at two liquor stores in
Sunnyvale, a computer store in San Francisco and one in Fremont,
authorities said.
   Thirty-seven people have been charged with taking in at least $1
billion through merchants in Los Angeles, Texas, Florida and New
York, then sending the laundered cash to Colombian drug lords.
   ``Enormous amounts of money generated by the sale of narcotics
were allegedly run through a variety of apparently legitimate
businesses to make it appear to be from legal business activities,''
Matthew B. Pavone, coordinator of the Organized Crime Drug
Enforcement Task Force, said Friday.
   ``These funds were deposited into various banks across the
country and then wire-transferred to countries with bank secrecy
laws and deposited into numbered accounts belonging to various drug
cartel operations,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge ordered a stockbroker held without
bail until his trial on charges he bilked clients out of more than
$2 million, saying the former Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. employee
might flee the country.
   ``I do not believe ... that the court has a reasonable assurance
that you will appear'' to face trial if allowed out on bail, U.S.
Magistrate Joyce L. Alexander told Walter F. Curran on Friday.
   ``Notwithstanding family, notwithstanding friends, you might
leave; you have already done it once, and you might do it again,''
Alexander said.
   She noted that when the 46-year-old Boston man was caught at the
Canadian border in Massena, N.Y., on Feb. 17, he had two passports,
an international driver's license, a plane ticket to Germany,
jewelry and the combination to a safe that has not been located.
   Curran persuaded clients to invest money in his personal account
rather than through Dean Witter, promising them 20 percent interest,
then converted the money to his own use, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Peter Mullin said.
   Mullin said the broker also wrote six checks, each for $125,000
to $500,000, on overdrawn bank accounts.
   The prosecutor said the investment and bank frauds involved ``a
total dollar loss of between $2 million and $5 million.''
   Defense attorney Thomas Troy said he would appeal Alexander's
decision.
   Curran is being held at the Middlesex County Jail. If convicted,
he could be sentenced to up to 10 years in jail and a $500,000 fine.
   Mullin said he could not predict when the case would come to
trial, but said it could take months.

   Phone companies must use different prefixes
for calling services with sexually explicit material, supply them
only by subscription and allow businesses to block those calls, a
state agency ruled.
   Friday's action by the California Public Utilities Commission was
hailed as a major ruling by attorney Robert Gnaizda of Public
Advocates, who represented 12 groups that sought changes to protect
consumers and prevent children from ``running up bills of thousands
of dollars'' with the calls.
   The tentative decision, scheduled to come up for a final vote on
March 22, expands a 1987 ruling that allowed residential customers
to block the calls, which typically carry 976 prefixes.
   Businesses and schools have sought the option because many of
their phones are easily accessible and often go unmonitored.
   Recorded and live messages intended only for adults would be
limited to a separate telephone prefix.
   In addition to restricting the services to subscription only, the
commission limited costs to no more than $5 for the first minute and
$1 for each additional minute, with a $20 maximum cost per call.
   Gnaizda said the change in per-minute charges was the most
innovative aspect of the commission's ruling.
   The largest monthly bill for 976 service known to Gnaizda was
$6,000.
   ``Many of them (bills) were in the $5,000 to $6,000 range. So
that's not surprising at all,'' he said.
   But Gnaizda was skeptical about the plan to have phone companies
use three different prefixes to differentiate between services with
sexually explicit material that would be harmful to children, and
provide such messages only by subscription.
   ``They'll never be able to define it,'' he said.
   The commission also said Pacific Bell must contact customers as
soon as the calls reach $150 or more in a billing period, or
temporarily block those services until the customer has been
notified and given the chance to stop it.
   It also said the seller of the phone service must provide an
introductory message warning callers of the call's price and giving
them a chance to hang up without charge.
   ``While this (revised settlement) does not constitute a perfect
900 service, in our judgment it will produce a service with
substantial benefit for California,'' the commission said in a
statement.
   ``Our goal is to disconnect dial-a-porn,'' said Pacific Bell
spokesman Jim Herold. ``But until we have legal authority to do
that, we've designed our new 900 service to solve the problems some
consumers have had with 976.''

<HEAD>Strong Snowstorm Blitzes New England Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful snowstorm that dumped as much as 2 feet of snow on the
Middle Atlantic States buffeted the New England coast with winds up
to 52 mph and heavy snow today. Record low temperatures prompted
freeze warnings in Florida.
   Winds gusting to 52 mph in Chatham, Mass., produced blowing and
drifting snow that made it seem like a blizzard, and 6 inches of
snow fell in six hours overnight.
   In Falmouth, Mass., winds gusted to 46 mph and 7 inches of snow
fell. Five inches fell in Portsmouth, R.I. In six hours overnight, 1
inch fell in Boston and Escanaba, Mich.
   Up to 10 inches of snow was expected in southern Maine.
   The storm hit Virginia on Friday with up to 12 inches of snow and
winds gusting to 60 mph that caused hundreds of traffic accidents,
delayed flights, closed schools and businesses and knocked out power
for about 50,000 people, authorities said.
   In New Jersey, 24 inches of snow fell Friday in northern Cape May
County, 18 to 19 inches in Atlantic City and 12 inches in Pomona.
   In Florida early today, temperatures had already dropped into the
mid- to upper 30s as far south as the central part of the state, the
third day of low temperatures. West Palm Beach snapped the 1940
record for the date of 40 degrees with a temperature of 39.
   A hard freeze warning was issued for the northern peninsula, and
a freeze warning was in effect in the central peninsula, where many
citrus and vegetable farms are.
   ``The timing couldn't be worse,'' said grower Cheryl Meeks of
Plant City. ``Strawberries are at their prime. The fields and plants
are loaded; they're just hanging there.''
   Temperatures were also low in much of the rest of the South, with
readings in the 20s and 30s from Mississippi to the Tennessee Valley
and the southern Atlantic Coast.

<HEAD>First Of 400 Political Prisoners Released By Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A well-known Mexican poet was among the first
of more than 400 inmates freed under an amnesty program for
political prisoners, the government said.
   Despite the pardon and release Friday of poet and human rights
advocate Israel Gutierrez Hernandez, activists complained that
hundreds of others remain behind prison bars.
   ``I am very excited, I feel like this is a dream, but I don't
have much else to say,'' the government news agency Notimex quoted
Gutierrez Hernandez as saying when he was released from state prison
in the central city of San Luis Potosi.
   He served five years of a 10-year sentence for robbery, criminal
association and possession of weapons. The 37-year-old poet, who has
denied the charges, was known as an adviser to peasant groups
fighting for land rights.
   The program unveiled this week by President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari appears aimed at appeasing human rights activists who say
hundreds have been jailed or killed for their political beliefs.
   Interior Minister Fernando Gutierrez Barrios said the 403
prisoners to be freed were jailed for violations committed for
social and political reasons. A statement from the president's
office said Salinas would work with state governors to free 402
other prisoners jailed for various offenses nationwide. It gave no
timetable.
   Salinas also pledged to send to Congress a list of proposed penal
code reforms that would make it easier to pardon some prisoners who
committed crimes for political reasons, the statement said.
   Luis Ortiz Monasterio, the department's human rights director,
said Friday about 1,200 people jailed for crimes stemming from
social struggles were expected to be released, Notimex said.
   He was quoted as saying the list of 403 prisoners includes
inmates from only 10 of Mexico's 31 states, because other state
governments denied having anyone jailed for social or politically
motivated crimes.
   Rosario Ibarra, the country's most prominent human rights
crusader, said the government made the proposal because opposition
groups have pressed for release of political prisoners.
   But she said the program falls short.
   ``What we're sure of is that we will have to intensify the
struggle for the the 1,000 prisoners whose release we are demanding
and for the 548 `disappeared' who must be accounted for,'' the
newspaper El Universal quoted her as saying.
   The ``disappeared'' refers to political prisoners whose
whereabouts are unknown and who are presumed dead.
   Mrs. Ibarra this month held a hunger strike outside the Interior
Department to press for release of the prisoners and an explanation
of the whereabouts of missing prisoners.
   The government previously has released prisoners, including those
jailed during the 1968 student movement, in what amounted to a tacit
acknowledgement that it had political prisoners.
   An editorial in the leftist newspaper La Jornada said the pardon
``should be viewed as a political gesture ... as a response to
petitions and demands.
   ``The question of human rights continues to be a delicate matter
with points on the agenda that still aren't resolved,'' it said.
   ``The political disappearances, tortures, persecutions, illegal
detentions add up to a group of anticonstitutional and injurious
actions for the national harmony.''
   Amnesty International said in its 1988 report that arbitrary
detentions and killings of peasant and Indian group members
continue, particularly in land disputes. Torture and other
mistreatment of prisoners also continue, and at least 23 political
prisoners remained in jail, the report said.

   A Thai court fined two Americans for
desecrating a Buddha after a photography session in which the model
posed in her underwear beside the statue, police said today.
   The court in the southern island resort of Phuket sentenced
photographer Sante Maria D'Razzio, 33, of New Jersey, and Kara Ruth
Young, a 23-year-old model from California, to pay $118 each in
fines, said police Sub. Lt. Amnuey Kraiwuttianant. It also gave each
18-month suspended jail terms.
   Hometowns of the pair were not released.
   Authorities said they faced up to seven years in prison.
   The pair were arrested Sunday after a picture-taking session for
the French magazine Vogue inside Chung Len Buddhist temple. Police
said Ms. Young had been posing by a Buddha in her underwear.
   Thailand is a predominately Buddhist country.

<HEAD>Party Chief In Soviet Moldavia Endorses Nationalist Demands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chief in Soviet Moldavia has
endorsed demands by Moldavian nationalists to make their language
official and use the alphabet of neighboring Romania.
   Thousands of demonstrators rallied in recent weeks in the
republic's capital, Kishinev, to demand official status for the
Moldavian language and introduction of a Latin alphabet, used for
the otherwise identical Romanian language.
   Despite attempts by the Russian Czars and Soviet authorities to
align Moldavians with Russia, Romania has long maintained that
Moldavians are really Romanians in language and culture.
   Party leader Semyon Grossu went on the western republic's
television Friday and condemned the activists for going too far, but
he indicated support on the language issue, according to the
official news agency Tass.
   ``Working out the conception of the Moldavian state language is
envisaged, as well as studying problems in connection with the
transfer of written Moldavian to the Latin alphabet,'' Tass
paraphrased Grossu as saying.
   He said preparation is under way on a series of draft laws on the
status of the Moldavian language, Tass reported.
   Moldavians have long objected to the Soviet insistence that they
use the Cyrillic alphabet, the one used for Russian, for their
regional language. They say they prefer the Latin alphabet used for
Romanian.
   The republic of 4.2 million people has had a history of foreign
domination. Known as Bessarabia under the Turks, it was annexed by
the Russian Czars from the Ottoman Empire in 1912. Romania seized
the area in 1918 and ruled it until the Soviet Union took it over in
1940.
   The following year, Romanian troops reoccupied the region. The
Red Army reclaimed it in 1944.
   In the television broadcast, Grossu condemned the recent
nationalist demonstrations, saying they were unsanctioned and that
their organizers ``stir up fright and emotions,'' Tass said. He
called the protests an example of ``extremism, demagoguery and
irresponsibility.''
   Under Mikhail Gorbachev, nationalism has blossomed in many parts
of the Soviet Union, especially the Baltic republics of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania.
   Gorbachev has allowed greater autonomy for the republics in
cultural, economic and linguistic affairs. Activists have used his
policy of glasnost, or openness, to vent long pent-up national
grievances.

<HEAD>New York City To Transfer Mental Patients to Shelters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York City is hoping a program to transfer
some mental patients to shelters for the homeless will help relieve
the severe overcrowding in psychiatric wards, The New York Times
reported today.
   ``We are going to try it on a small scale,'' said First Deputy
Mayor Stanley Brezenoff. ``If it doesn't work, we won't continue
it.''
   The new policy was adopted over the objections of two city
commissioners, the Times said.
   In a memo written by city Human Resources Administrator William
Grinker and Sara L. Kellermann, the commissioner of the city's
Department of Mental Health, the two argued that the plan was
ill-advised.
   ``A policy reversal to discharge ... patients to municipal
shelters at this juncture would discredit the expanded city effort
to treat its most vulnerable population,'' they wrote.
   But Brezenoff said the plan is an attempt at ``pragmatic
humaneness.''
   Shelters receiving the patients would be staffed with
psychiatrists, nurses and social workers to try to help the patients
find a place to live.
   Dr. Luis Marcos, vice president for mental hygiene at the city's
Health and Hospitals Corp., said work has started to provide 46 beds
at two shelters in Manhattan and Brooklyn with mental health
services.
   ``Ideally a shelter is not the optimal residence _ it is a last
resort,'' Marcos said. ``But it is better to discharge appropriate
patients to the shelters than have them inappropriately occupy a
hospital bed that can be used by patients waiting in the emergency
room.''
   Critics of the new plan, however, said all it does is shift
patients from one city agency to another without solving any
problems.
   Many experts say the city's homeless problems stem from a state
decision decades ago to empty beds in state psychiatric hospitals
without any alternatives for those needing assistance.
   The new city plan, some experts said, would repeat the mistakes
of the state.

   Shots were fired in the air today as
supporters of former President Ferdinand Marcos scuffled with police
on the third anniversary of the ``people power'' uprising that
propelled Corazon Aquino to the presidency.
   Mrs. Aquino, who returned today from the funeral of Emperor
Hirohito, said international leaders _ among them President Bush _
``they told me that they admire us Filipinos for that non-violent
revolution.''
   She made her comments during festivities along Epifanio delos
Santos Avenue, where hundreds of thousands of civilians massed three
years ago to protect soldiers who had mutinied against Marcos.
   But some prominent Filipinos who helped install her in power
boycotted the festivities to show disappointment with Mrs. Aquino's
leadership. Police estimated today's crowd at 30,000, smaller than
the last two anniversaries.
   In his anniversary address, Manila's Roman Catholic archbishop,
Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, praised the spirit of the uprising but warned
that corruption and political bickering had returned ``to the dismay
of us all.''
   Witnesses said the trouble started when about 3,000 loyalists
rallied near a television station demanding Marcos be allowed to
return from exile in Hawaii. Marcos, in declining health, has lived
in Honolulu since the uprising ended his 20-year rule on Feb. 25,
1986.
   Witnesses said three men bolted from the car and grabbed at least
one Marcos supporter and forced him into their vehicle. When
protesters rushed the car, the intruders fired in the air and sped
away, the witnesses said.
   Later, police Pfc. Albert Gatos said he and two fellow officers
were transporting a robbery suspect to headquarters when the
loyalists attacked their car. Gatos said the ``abducted'' loyalist
had been arrested.
   Today's anniversary celebrations began with the ringing of church
bells across this island nation and included masses, fireworks and
street dancing along Epifanio avenue. Smaller celebrations were
planned in most provincial cities.
   While Mrs. Aquino was in Tokyo for Friday's funeral, the
160,000-member armed forces were on full alert because of coup
rumors sweeping the capital.
   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre said about 2,000 troops would
provide security during the festivities, which will also include a
Roman Catholic Mass, street dancing, fireworks and dedication of a
giant statue of the Virgin Mary.
   Meanwhile, the military said a soldier and two civilians were
arrested outside the capital in a van packed with 1,650 pounds of
explosives. A senior officer said the three are believed linked to
right-wing extremists.
   Lt. Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy chief of the National Capital
Region Defense Command, said the soldier, a second man and a woman
were arrested late Friday in Taytay, a few miles from the
celebration site.
   ``The implication is quite big,'' Oxales said. Asked if the
explosives were meant for a new coup attempt, he said: ``We're
trying to find out.''
   The military also said an officer in a province about 200 miles
southeast of Manila was placed under restrictions for purported
links to renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan, leader of a 1987
attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino.
   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, the former defense minister, said he
would boycott today's festivities.
   ``I will not join the celebrations because I think there is no
cause for celebration,'' Enrile said. ``They really wanted change
for the country, but ... nothing is clear and our future is still
dim.''
   Enrile in his former post led a mutiny against Marcos on Feb. 22,
1986, that triggered the ``people power'' uprising.
   But Enrile later turned against Mrs. Aquino. She fired him as
defense minister on Nov. 23, 1986, after a failed coup by his
followers.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, another key figure in the 1986
revolt, said today the government needs more time to achieve all its
goals.
   ``We should not be discouraged,'' Ramos told reporters. ``We
should not listen that our government is on the brink of collapse
and that the Filipinos cannot do it.''
   Liberals and leftist activists say Mrs. Aquino tolerates military
abuses of civil rights in the government's 20-year war against
communist guerrillas and has not pressed land reform and other
social programs.
   On Friday, about 10,000 leftists took to the streets in Manila to
express their dissatisfaction with Mrs. Aquino, shouting
anti-government slogans and burning a 10-foot papier mache effigy of
the president.

   The only officer charged in connection
with the death of a Marine corporal abandoned in the Mojave Desert
was found guilty of dereliction of duty but innocent of a more
serious charge.
   An eight-officer military jury deliberated more than two hours
before returning a verdict about midnight Friday. It found that 1st
Lt. Allen Lawson had acted improperly by failing to post guides in
pairs during a desert training exercise in August.
   However, Lawson was found innocent of willfully disobeying an
order to provide a roster of men placed in the desert. Lance Cpl.
Jason Rother, 19, died when he was left alone in the Mojave and not
reported missing for two days.
   At sentencing today, Lawson, 25, of Flint, Mich., faced the
possibility of discharge from the Marines and a prison term.
   Lawson also was found guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer for
appearing drunk in downtown Jacksonville in December. That charge
was unconnected with Rother's death.
   In a statement given to reporters before the court-martial
verdict was announced, Lawson said Rother's death was part of the
cost of military preparedness.
   ``It is testimony to the fidelity, hard work and devotion of the
... Marines that Lance Cpl. Rother was the only casualty,'' Lawson
wrote. ``War is dangerous, and training for war is dangerous.''
   But, he added: ``Yes, I am sorry that Lance Cpl. Rother was left
out in the desert, unaccounted for, to fend for himself for 40
hours. I am deeply sorry that he met his demise in the desert.''
   Rother of Minneapolis was posted as a road guide during night
maneuvers at the Marine base in Twentynine Palms, Calif. When the
maneuvers ended, Rother was overlooked by a truck convoy and left in
the desert.
   He was not reported missing for two days, and a search turned up
only some of his equipment and an arrow made of stones at his post.
His remains were discovered Dec. 4.
   Several officers in Rother's battalion were reassigned after a
Marine investigation of the incident, and two sergeants who were
Rother's immediate superiors were convicted by courts-martial and
reduced in rank.

<TEXT>
   Many of the 590,000 people who sought
compensation after the Bhopal gas disaster filed false injury
claims, and about half the claimants may never get any money, relief
officials said today.
   The government is eager to settle claims after Union Carbide
Corp. on Friday finished putting up $470 million ordered by the
Indian Supreme Court to fully settle injury claims. The court
ordered the payment on Feb. 14 to settle claims arising from the
leak, the world's worst industrial disaster.
   ``We have sent repeated reminders to the claimants to get
themselves medically examined or produce documents proving that they
were affected by the toxic gas,'' said a senior official of the
government's Gas Relief and Rehabilitation Department.
   ``But under half of the total claimants have so far come forward
to get themselves certified as gas victims,'' the official said on
condition of anonymity.
   The government was asked Friday to submit a breakdown of how the
funds would be allotted within a week.
   More than 3,400 people were killed by the leak of methyl
isocyanate gas from a Union Carbide pesticide plant on Dec. 3, 1984,
in this central Indian city.
   Victims are still dying at the rate of more than one daily,
medical records indicate.
   The government says 20,000 people are seriously injured by
exposure to the gas. About 590,000 people have filed damage claims,
alleging certain injuries.
   The government set up the Gas Relief and Rehabilitation
Department to handle documentation of claims. About 100 doctors have
been helping bureaucrats identify victims.
   About 250,000 claims have been certified so far, officials said.
   They said they would like to provide money to genuine victims as
soon as possible. Since repeated reminders have failed to produce
medical evidence in so many cases, they said they suspect many
claims are false.
   ``The sooner we can identify the genuine victims, the sooner we
can give them compensation,'' one official said on condition of
anonymity.
   The Indian government initially filed suit on behalf of more than
a half million victims for damages of $3.3 billion.
   Union Carbide is a U.S. multinational company based in Danbury,
Conn.

   Some surprise developments enlivened the race for
mayor in its last full week, as a prominent Republican mounted a
write-in campaign and Democrat Richard M. Daley stirred up a racial
issue.
   Both events could spell trouble for Daley in his effort to claim
the office that was once all but owned by his father, the late Mayor
Richard J. Daley.
   Republican Edward Vrdolyak, a former power in the Democratic
Party, on Wednesday gave his blessing to a write-in effort in his
behalf in next Tuesday's primary.
   Ordinarily, a Republican write-in campaign in this Democratic
city would be of little consequence. But some observers believe
Vrdolyak could cut into the lead polls have given Daley in the
Democratic primary.
   The reasoning is that Vrdolyak has a following among some white
ethnic voters who would have been expected to cast their votes for
Daley, rather than Mayor Eugene Sawyer, who is black.
   Meanwhile, Daley, the Cook County state's attorney, was
criticized Friday for remarks he made at a rally before a
predominantly white audience on the Southwest Side.
   John McDermott, chairman of the Committee on Decent, Unbiased
Campaign Tactics, charged that Daley told the crowd: ``You want a
white mayor to sit down with everybody.''
   Daley angrily denied he made a racial comment and some people who
listened to tape recordings said it appeared he merely stumbled over
a word that made it sound like he said ``white mayor.''
   Recent polls have continued to give Daley a lead, but a narrowing
one.
   Whoever wins the Democratic primary will run in the April 4
general election against the winner of the GOP primary as well as
the third-party candidacy of Alderman Timothy Evans, who like Sawyer
is black.
   Vrdolyak is running against GOP-endorsed Herbert Sohn.
   In a radio show taping, Vrdolyak said he hopes to win 10,000
votes, enough to guarantee him the nomination in this Democratic
stronghold. That is half what he got from his own ward in a failed
1987 mayoral bid.
   His big challenge Tuesday will be to get people to properly write
in votes with punch-card voting machines, said Paul Green, a
professor at Governors State University in suburban University Park.
   ``It's physically very difficult to have legal write-ins on a
punch-card system,'' said Green, who follows city politics.

   A veteran sheriff's deputy is being held for
investigation into the murders of three prostitutes after he was
arrested while allegedly sharing cocaine with another prostitute.
   Deputy Rickey Ross, 40, was picked up early Thursday by police
officers, and a loaded gun found in the trunk of the county-leased,
unmarked car Ross was driving was linked through ballistics tests to
three 1988 murders, police Chief Daryl Gates and Los Angeles County
Sheriff Sherman Block told a press conference Friday.
   The south-central area of the city, where Ross was arrested, has
been the scene of numerous prostitute slayings since the late 1970s,
including some once attributed to a ``Southside Slayer'' but later
to several suspects.
   Gates would not comment on any possible connection between
unsolved killings and the three murders linked to Ross, who has been
with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for 18 years.
   ``There are some differences with other homicides in the
south-central portion of Los Angeles, so this could be three and
only three and we're not speculating that there will be any more
than this,'' Gates said.
   Ross is one of a number of suspects under investigation in a
series of prostitute slayings, Deputy District Attorney Sterling E.
Norris said.
   The district attorney's office is reviewing the evidence on Ross
and a decision on charges will be made Monday, said spokesman Andy
Reynolds.
   Block said Ross, who is married and has two children, ages 20 and
5, had been assigned to a narcotics unit at Los Angeles
International Airport.
   ``He has a very fine record,'' Block said. ``He has been a very
effective investigator in the narcotics bureau.''
   The officers originally arrested Ross for investigation of
driving under the influence of an intoxicating substance. The name
of the woman in the car with Ross was withheld, but Gates said she
told investigators they had been smoking cocaine. Gates said
officers determined she was a prostitute.
   As ballistics testing of the gun found in the trunk was
performed, Ross and investigators went to his home in Rialto, about
55 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. About 5 p.m. Thursday, tests
linked the gun to the three killings and he was arrested for
investigation of murder.
   A search warrant was obtained and the home was searched but Gates
would not reveal any information about what was recovered there.

   Demonstrators today shouted anti-U.S
and anti-government slogans and threw firebombs at police during
protests in several South Korean cities.
   Riot police broke up the rallies, often forming a wall with their
shields. In some cities, police used tear gas and engaged in running
clashes with protesters.
   Police officials said 25,000 riot police were on top alert in
metropolitan Seoul to block protests against the visit Monday of
President Bush. Bush and his wife, Barbara, arrived today in Beijing
for a weekend visit following a stopover in Tokyo for Emperor
Hirohito's funeral.
   The turnout for today's protests was small, with no more than a
few thousand people taking part nationwide. The protesters shouted
slogans, including ``Bush Go Home!'' and ``Down With Roh Tae-woo!''
   The nation's largest dissident alliance issued a statement
demanding Bush cancel his visit, which it said was designed to
bolster the government of South Korean President Roh Tae-woo. Roh
marks his first anniversary in office today.
   ``The United States is scheming, through Bush's visit, to
perpetuate the division of the Korean peninsula, stabilize the
military dictatorship and heighten tensions,'' said the United
National Democratic Movement of Korea.
   About 500 radical students gathered at South Gate, one of Seoul's
ancient city gates, and shouted slogans, but police dispersed them
and arrested some. Police used tear gas to break up 200 students
holding a rally near the Seoul railway station.
   About 100 dissidents held a rally inside a downtown Seoul church
to demand Roh's ouster.
   In the provincial city of Kwangju, riot police blocked a planned
rally, and students and farmers armed with rocks and firebombs
fought running battles with police, who fired tear gas, the news
agency Yonhap said.
   Dissidents also have called for protest rallies Monday to oppose
the Bush visit.

   Navajo Tribal Chairman Peter MacDonald
plans ``business as usual,'' despite a court order removing him from
office for the second time this month, a spokeswoman says.
   The Navajo Supreme Court on Friday overturned an order by Keyenta
tribal District Judge Harry Brown that reinstated MacDonald as
chairman pending a full hearing of the case.
   The Supreme Court also ordered Brown, who is MacDonald's
brother-in-law, to show cause Tuesday why he shouldn't be removed
from the case.
   After being served with the Supreme Court order, Brown canceled
the hearing he had scheduled to consider the validity of a Feb. 17
Tribal Council vote that placed MacDonald and Vice Chairman Johnny
R. Thompson on administrative leave.
   MacDonald was accused of corruption earlier this month in
Congressional hearings.
   In the wake of the Supreme Court's order, tribal delegate
Marshall Plummer said it was his understanding that he was once more
in charge of the 88-member council. He was elected council chairman
pro tempore in the disputed vote last week.
   ``We are in control now. This shows that the Tribal Council has
got the authority,'' Plummer said.
   However, MacDonald spokeswoman Tazbah McCullah said MacDonald
still believes he is in charge despite the council action and the
Supreme Court's decision.
   MacDonald planned a busy weekend of executive functions,
including speeches in several communities. ``It's business as
usual,'' she said.

   President Bush flew to China today, clasped hands
with ordinary people in Beijing's main square and urged Chinese
leaders to join the United States in planting trees of world peace
so future generations ``can sit together in the shade.''
   The president and his wife, Barbara, were jubilant on their
return to the country where Bush served as America's diplomatic
representative in the mid-1970s. ``It's great to be back,'' he
declared.
   At a welcoming banquet in the Great Hall of the People, Bush
toasted his host, President Yang Shangkun, and recalled a Chinese
proverb that says ``one generation plants a tree, the next sits in
its shade.''
   `We owe it to mankind to work together for peace and
international stability,'' Bush said. ``Let us continue, then, to
work together, to plant trees together, so that the next generation,
ours and yours, can sit together in the shade.''
   In response, Yang praised Bush for making ``great contributions
to developing Chinese-U.S. relations.'' He said that ``steady
development of these relations will be of enormous significance.''
   Thousands of people crowded along the wide, flag-draped boulevard
in front of Tiananmen Square, where Bush hopped from his limousine
to shake some hands. It was his fifth visit to China since he spent
two years as the chief U.S. envoy to Beijing before formal
Sino-American relations were restored.
   ``Welcome back,'' someone called out to Bush in English. The
president replied in tentative Chinese, ``Xie xie (thank you).''
   From the airport, where he arrived in late afternoon from Tokyo,
Bush was driven to the Diaoyutai State Guest House for a formal
welcome over tea with Premier Li Peng.
   The president gave Li a pair of Texas boots and the premier gave
Bush and his wife, Barbara, a couple of bicycles. When he lived here
previously, Bush was known for his habit of biking around the
capital.
   En route, Mrs. Bush told reporters she was excited to be
returning to China.
   Seeing the country for the first time was like seeing ``a black
and white movie,'' she said. ``Last time we were there _ three or
four years ago _ it was really an emerged nation. I love China. I
had very, very happy years there.''
   At Tiananmen Square, where U.S. and Chinese flags flew side by
side, Chinese people halted their bicycles for a curious glimpse at
their American guest. A few of them applauded.
   The Bushes visit here blends sentiment and statecraft. Before
leaving Tokyo, the president declared that his talks with 20 foreign
leaders in the Japanese capital had yielded ``a shared sense of
satisfaction'' with the course of East-West relations, and laid a
good foundation for advancing the security interests of the United
States and its allies.
   Bush arrived at Beijing's old airport, now used only by
high-ranking Chinese officials and visiting dignitaries. Bush,
wearing an overcoat in 40-degree weather, waved once as he descended
the ramp. He was followed by his wife, who wore a purple coat.
   In keeping with Chinese custom, there was no arrival ceremony or
statements. Bush was greeted by Vice Premier Wu Xuequian and Vice
Foreign Minister Zhu Qizhen, and two children gave the president and
his wife bouquets of flowers.
   ``I know I will marvel at the changes'' in China since he served
as head of the U.S. Liaison Office in 1974-75, Bush told reporters
earlier. He said ``we obviously have differences'' but that his
visit would strength an already-solid relationship.
   ``I'm excited about it. There's an openness in China that I never
would have predicted 15 years ago,'' he said.
   His Beijing talks were to focus on Sino-American ties, with
glancing attention to an overflow cup of topics that could spark
debate _ including reunifying Taiwan with the mainland, human rights
in Tibet and trade issues.
   Bush disclosed that he will meet in Beijing with Cambodian
opposition leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk, whom the United States
favors as leader of an interim government following a pullout of
Vietnamese occupation forces. The president said the United States
was seeking to prevent the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge from returning
to power in Cambodia.
   At a separate meeting, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichend agreed that Vietnam should
withdraw from Cambodia as soon as possible and expressed support for
Sihanouk's peace efforts, the Chinese news agency Xinhua reported.
   Bush's itinerary included meetings with the four leaders who call
the shots for China's government and Communist Party. He departs for
Seoul en route home to Washington on Monday.
   His agenda Sunday included a Protestant worship service, a
private meeting with Premier Li Peng and a reciprocal banquet for
Chinese leaders featuring Texas barbecued ribs and Lone Star beer.
   He also is scheduled to meet with senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
attend a reception with U.S. Embassy personnel and confer with
Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   Deng and Yang represent the old guard of pre-liberation
revolutionaries, while Zhao and Li are younger and more in tune with
goals of guiding China's 1 billion people toward economic prosperity.
   Before leaving Tokyo, Bush held a news conference in the
residence of the U.S. ambassador, where he vowed to continue the
fight for Tower's confirmation.
   Bush said he was firmly behind Tower, whose nomination was
spurned 11-9 by the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday, saying
he had no ``fallback'' planned except to lobby strongly with
``whoever has an open mind on the subject.''
   In fact, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters accompanying Bush to China on Air Force One that Tower
would undertake a public relations offensive next week, making a
speech to the National Press Club and appearing on television
interview programs. He said that Bush will meet with a dozen
senators Tuesday to seek support for Tower.
   Before leaving Tokyo, Bush met briefly at the Imperial Palace
with Japan's new emperor, Akihito, before sitting down separately
with Presidents Jose Sarney of Brazil and Ibrahim Babangida of
Nigeria, bringing to 20 the number of foreign leaders he has met
with in two days.
   Summing up his fast-paced diplomacy in Tokyo, Bush said:
   ``Throughout all of our discussions ... I found a shared sense of
satisfaction ... that East-West relations are now clearly proceeding
on the basis of an agenda favorable to the United States, its
allies, its friends.''

<HEAD>For First Time, Soviets Shut Down Operating Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet authorities today began shutting down
Armenia's nuclear power plant as a precaution in case another
earthquake strikes the region, according to the official news agency.
   It was the first time the Soviets have ever halted operations at
a plant that appears to have no problems.
   The Armenian plant was criticized when it was first built, and
concerns took on new urgency after an earthquake on Dec. 7
devastated northwestern Armenia and killed 25,000 people. Soviet
authorities say the quake did not damage the plant, 20 miles from
the republic's capital, Yerevan.
   The news agency Tass said technicians today finished closing one
of the plant's two water-cooled, uranium-powered reactors. The
second reactor is to be shut down March 18.
   The move was another example of the Kremlin's new, more cautious
approach to nuclear power adopted after the April 26, 1986,
explosion and fire at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the
Ukraine. The world's worst nuclear power accident killed 31 people
and sent a cloud of radiation around the world.
   An Armenian, Georgy Ter-Stepanyan, told the youth newspaper
Komsomolskaya Pravda that he was among a group of scientists that
protested when plans were announced for the Armenian plant in the
late 1960s.
   Ter-Stepanyan said he and others pointed out that the station was
planned for construction on the Ararat geological fault and would be
vulnerable to earthquakes. Any radiation leak would contaminate the
republic's main water supply, today's editions of the newspaper
quoted him as saying.
   The Armenian plant, designed to operate 30 years, began supplying
electricity for the republic and others in the Soviet Caucasus
region in 1976, Tass said.
   In May 1986, a month after the Chernobyl disaster and a year
after Mikhail S. Gorbachev took power, authorities began
reconsidering the merits of the plant.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told reporters on Dec. 12 that the
plant would be shut down in two years because of the earthquake
danger.
   But a group of experts sent to the plant after the Dec. 7
earthquake concluded that unless the plant were strengthened, its
reactors should be shut down immediately.
   The government heeded the advice out of ``concern for the safety
of Armenian pouplation,'' Tass said. More than 1 million people live
in Yerevan.
   The 407,500-kilowatt plant generates more than one-third of
Armenia's electricity, and authorities have called for residents to
conserve power to avoid shortages. It is to be turned into a thermal
plant, probably using natural gas as a fuel, in a project expected
to take up to four years to complete, Tass said.
   In December, Soviet officials said six nuclear power projects had
been scrapped because of earthquake danger or tougher standards
imposed because of Chernobyl.

   Soviet Ambassador Valery Nikolaenko
said Moscow will reasses its arms shipments to the leftist
Sandinista government because it wants to help end regional
conflicts.
   Central America's troubles ``cannot be solved militarily, only
through peaceful means, through negotiation,'' Nikolaenko told a
news conference Friday. He also praised the region's latest peace
plan. The agreement was signed by the five Central American
presidents in El Salvador on Feb. 14.
   During the summit, President Daniel Ortega agreed to hold
elections in February 1990, 10 months earlier than expected, to
guarantee the integrity of those elections and to ensure that
opposition parties have equal access to radio and television air
time during the campaigns.
   Ortega and his counterparts in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras
and Costa Rica also agreed to draft within 90 days a detailed
program to effect ``the demobilization, repatriation or voluntary
relocation in third countries'' of an estimated 20,000 Nicaraguan
rebels and their families in neighboring Honduras.
   The U.S.-backed rebels, known as the Contras, have been fighting
Nicaragua's government from bases in Honduras since 1981. In
February 1988, Congress stopped military aid to the Contras. Top
officials of the Bush administration have indicated they may support
the peace plan.
   The Kremlin's ambassador to Nicaragua distributed a statement
praising the Central American summit.
   ``The results of the meeting ... are evaluated positively by the
Soviet Union and are considered as an aspiration by these countries
to win a new push in the negotiation process directed at winning a
definitive political arrangement of the critical situation in the
area,'' the statement said.
   It said the Soviet Union ``is willing to actively contribute to
the advance of reparation of the situation in Central America, the
affirmation of peace, being good neighbors and cooperation between
the countries in the region.''
   Nikolaenko said Moscow plans ``a more thorough examination'' of
future weapons shipments to Nicaragua.
   He would not reveal how much military aid the Soviet Union
provides Nicaragua, but he said last year it exceeded $300 million.
   ``This help each year varies, although this year there are no
major changes,'' he said, adding the Soviet Union will continue
sending aid to Nicaragua ``without imposing any political ideology.''
   ``We are happy with any economic, political and social model the
Nicaraguan revolution decides to take,'' Nikolaenko said, adding
that the Sandinista revolution ``has gained great prestige.''
   When asked whether the Soviet Union will provide financial
assistance to Nicaragua if the Sandinista government is defeated,
the ambassador replied: ``We respect the sovereign decisions of
individual countries.''

   Prince Philip of Britain, who has been
criticized at home for attending Emperor Hirohito's funeral, today
honored British soldiers who died in World War II by laying wreaths
at a cemetery.
   Accompanied by Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe, Philip honored
the 1,738 British, Australian and other war dead buried at the
Yokohama Commonwealth War Cemetery a day after attending the
elaborate funeral of Emperor Hirohito.
   In drizzling rain, the two British representatives laid wreaths
at a crucifix in the center of the rolling cemetery grounds and
later spoke with members of the local British community.
   In London today, Queen Elizabeth II appealed to a World War II
veteran to end his hunger strike protest over Prince Philip's
attendance at the funeral. There was no immediate reaction to the
latest appeal from Andrew Burgess, 70, who has been eating nothing
and drinking only black tea for the last nine days.
   Philip's attendance at Hirohito's funeral has been criticized by
British war veterans and lawmakers who considered the late monarch a
war criminal and who saw no reason to honor a man they blamed for
the deaths of thousands of their comrades. The royal family was
criticized for sending the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, and the
decision was debated in editorial columns.
   ``To many millions outside Japan, Hirohito will be remembered
less for the dignified last years of his reign than for its first
phase, when aggressive war was waged in his name and barbarous
atrocities were committed,'' The Times of London wrote in a January
editorial after Hirohito's death. ``To those people, the emperor's
passing will bring back painful memories.''
   Fighting under Hirohito's name, Japanese forces killed 27,000
British soldiers and another 20,000 Dutch.
   Many survivors also held Hirohito accountable for atrocities
committed against 127,000 Dutch people interned during the war.
   ``We are accustomed to hear such kind of criticism,'' said
Seizaburo Sato, a professor of political science at Tokyo
University. ``Japan made a mistake.''
   ``But didn't (the) British or Dutch do really bad things to
Asians they colonized, for example, India or Indonesia? If they
think about what they have done for a much longer period of time
than Japan did, I think they should be more modest,'' he said in an
interview.
   Most historians maintain that the late emperor was merely a
glorified figurehead of his generals with little, if any, political
power. Hirohito died on Jan. 7 at age 87, never having made clear
his role in the war.
   The cemetery is on the site of a playground that was opened by
Hirohito himself more than 65 years ago when he was crown prince.
   Nestled in the hills of Hodogaya in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, the
cemetery also holds the remains of soldiers from Canada, India, New
Zealand and other Commonwealth nations, and the ashes of an
undetermined number of U.S. soldiers.
   Many died while being held as prisoners of war in Japan or aboard
POW ships on the way to Japan in 1942 following the surrender of
Singapore. ``He loved his life but gave it in freeing the Japanese
people,'' read one epitaph.

   Queen Elizabeth II appealed to a World War II
veteran today to end his hunger strike protest over Prince Philip's
attendance at the funeral of Emperor Hirohito of Japan.
   ``The queen is aware of his situation and now that the funeral is
over we hope that he will end his hunger strike,'' Buckingham Palace
said in a statement.
   There was no immediate reaction to the latest appeal from
70-year-old Andrew Burgess, who has been eating nothing and drinking
only black tea for the last nine days.
   During an appearance Friday night on Central Television's Weekend
Live program, Burgess rejected an earlier palace appeal to give up
the hunger strike.
   But Burgess said he might consider ending his fast if Prince
Philip announced he was stepping down as patron of the Burma Star
Association, a veterans group. Burgess is treasurer of the
association's Swansea branch.
   ``Prince Philip has sentenced me to death. Obviously the royals
don't give a damn about me or the brave men who laid down their
lives for king and country,'' he said.
   Burgess said British and Commonwealth prisoners of war were
``degraded in every possible way'' by their Japanese captors and the
presence of the queen's husband at the funeral was an insult to the
memory of thousands of brave men.
   He asked the queen to forgive him for starving himself to death.
   On Friday, while Hirohito's funeral was taking place, thousands
of British veterans attended services to remember the comrades lost
fighting the Japanese and vent the anger they still share.
   There were more than 25 services at war memorials and in churches
from Wales to Blackpool. Some veterans also celebrated the funeral
in pubs, and some refused to speak to a Japanese reporter at one
service.

   Aubrey Menen, a novelist, essay writer
and critic, has died of throat cancer, according to news reports. He
was 76.
   Menen was working on a book based on traditional family life in
his father's native state, Kerala, when he died Feb. 13.
   Menen was born in London in 1912 and lived mostly there after
taking British citizenship. However, he had been living in the
southern city of Trivandrum, capital of Kerala, since 1985.
   He wrote more than 25 books, including novels, short stories and
autobiographies. His first book, ``Prevalence of Witches,'' was
published in 1947. Other works included ``The Stumbling Stone,''
``The Backward Bride,'' ``The Fig Tree'' and ``Space Within the
Heart,'' an autobiography.
   Most of Menen's books were published in Britain, the United
States and India. He also wrote articles for Time and Life magazines
and contributed to literary journals.
   Two books by Menen, ``Ivory Horses'' and ``Kitchen in the
Gondola,'' will be published soon, his companion Graham Hall, told
The Statesman, a Calcutta newspaper.
   Menen, a bachelor, was cremated in Trivandrum.

<HEAD>Poll: Minnesotans Give Mondale Good Chance Of Beating Boschwitz In
'90</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Retransmits to fix category code.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Vice President Walter Mondale hasn't
decided whether to run against Sen. Rudy Boschwitz in 1990, but
Minnesotans give him a good chance of defeating the incumbent, a
survey released today shows.
   The poll, conducted by the Minneapolis Star Tribune on Feb.
15-20, found 49 percent of the 701 Minnesota adults surveyed
believed Mondale would defeat Boschwitz in a head-to-head race.
Forty percent said they thought Boschwitz would win.
   Spokesmen for both men described the results as ``interesting.''
   ``It's too early for these numbers to be very meaningful,'' said
Mondale's son, Ted, who has been urging his father to run.
   Boschwitz's campaign director, Tom Mason, said the poll
``confirms what everybody thinks. It would be a close, competitive
race.''
   Mondale, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1984, has said
repeatedly that he does not intend to run for office again. He now
works as a lawyer in Minneapolis.
   Mondale has led Boschwitz in every published poll in the last 18
months.
   An August 1987 poll of 757 Minnesota adults showed Mondale
leading Boschwitz by 15 percentage points.
   The latest poll, for which no margin of error was cited, showed a
slight erosion in Boschwitz's job-approval rating. Those who
``approve strongly'' of his performance fell to 22 percent, the
lowest since mid-1985. But his overall approval rating, which
includes strong and weak approval, held fairly steady at 62 percent;
he has never been below 60 percent during his second term.
   The percentage who said they had no opinion about Boschwitz's
performance or who refused to answer the question rose to its
highest level, at 20 percent.
   For Mondale, the fact that less than half the respondents
considered him the front-runner cannot be entirely encouraging.
   Next to Hubert H. Humphrey, Mondale has been the biggest name in
Minnesota politics over the last three decades.
   He was the state's attorney general, a U.S. senator, a vice
president and was the 1984 Democratic presidential candidate. Since
moving back to the state in 1987, he's been in the news as much or
more than Boschwitz.

<HEAD>Americans To Examine Soviet Psychiatric Patients For Alleged Abuses</HEAD>

   The Soviet Union, which says it has stopped
committing sane political dissidents to psychiatric hospitals, will
get a chance to prove that claim when a group of Amerian
psychiatrists visits Sunday.
   About 20 psychiatrists, accompanied by a State Department
official, arrive Sunday for a three week visit and will meet with
Soviets they suspect are being held in psychiatric institutions for
political reasons.
   A Soviet official said on Friday that the Americans will see that
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of perestroika, or
restructuring of Soviet society, has improved psychiatric treatment.
   ``They will be given the opportunity to familiarize themselves
with the system of psychiatric help in the U.S.S.R. and the positive
changes taking place in this area,'' said Yuri Reshetov of the
Foreign Ministry.
   The Americans will visit mental institutions, examine patients
and meet with Soviet psychiatrists, said Reshetov, head of the
ministry's international humanitarian cooperation and human rights
directorate.
   He said the trip was organized by the U.S. State and Health and
Human Services departments and the Soviet Foreign and Health
ministries.
   Neither Reshetov nor American officials would provide an
itinerary.
   Allowing U.S. officials into once-secret psychiatric institutions
is another example of Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater
openness.
   Abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union has been a contentious
issue between the superpowers for decades.
   Gorbachev, as part of a wide-ranging effort to improve the Soviet
Union's human rights record and restore credibility to his country's
health system, has taken steps to end abuse of psychiatry.
   In January 1988, the Soviet press reported some pyschiatric
hospitals were being transferred from the domain of the police to
the Health Ministry and that a new law made it a crime to commit a
sane person to a mental institution.
   Last month, the head of the Soviet psychiatrists' society, Georgy
Morozov, said: ``There are no patients in mental hospitals in the
U.S.S.R. who are there for political reasons.''
   Moscow activist Alexander Podrabinik and others have rejected
that claim. They say 20 to 30 healthy people remain in psychiatric
hospitals and in many cases are forcibly injected with mind-altering
drugs.
   The State Department last month credited the Soviets with
``significant progress'' in the treatment of political prisoners. It
said the Kremlin had freed all those held under laws limiting
expressions of political and religious beliefs, but that it still
had questions about 30 prisoners whom Soviet authorities consider to
be criminals.
   While many Western psychiatrists acknowledge the Kremlin has
freed most people committed to asylums for political reasons, they
have demanded an admission of past abuses.
   One Soviet publication came close in November.
   Mikhail I. Buyanov, a psychiatrist and neurologist, wrote in the
education newspaper Uchitelskaya Gazeta that Soviet psychiatry was
systematically used in the 1970s to suppress dissidents by declaring
them mentally ill and committing them to asylums. But he said
officials still haven't fully admitted mistakes.

   Stompie Seipei, the 14-year-old
activist allegedly killed by Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, was
eulogized today as a hero at a funeral marked by calls for black
militance and unity.
   Chanting youths ran ahead of the hearse to the cemetery where
Seipei's small wooden casket was buried.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, was not mentioned by name in a funeral service at a
Roman Catholic church in Tumahole, a black township 60 miles
southwest of Johannesburg.
   The 500 mourners at the church sang freedom songs and chanted
their loyalty to the ANC guerrilla movement and Mandela, the
country's best known black leader. The crowd swelled to 1,000 for
Seipei's burial.
   ``We shouldn't point fingers at other people because Stompie was
interested in unity,'' said a local anti-apartheid leader, McLean
Skhosane, at the service. ``Don't let his death divide us.''
   The African National Congress today issued a statement from
Lusaka, Zambia, calling on blacks to avoid ``fratricidal'' attacks
in the townships.
   Seipei's death is at the center of a controversy surrounding Mrs.
Mandela and her group of bodyguards, known as the Mandela United
Football Club.
   Seipei and three young men staying at a Methodist Church
sanctuary in the Soweto township outside Johannesburg allegedly were
abducted to Mrs. Mandela's home in late December and assaulted there
by members of Mandela United.
   Seipei's body was found in a Soweto field Jan. 6, police said.
Two members of Mandela United have been charged with murder, while
the team bus driver also has been arrested but not charged. Mrs.
Mandela has denied any personal involvement in Seipei's death.
   The reasons for Seipei's alleged abduction and beating remain
unclear.
   Mrs. Mandela has said the youths were taken from the Methodist
church because they were being sexually abused by a minister.
   However, Methodist church officials said after conducting an
investigation that there was no truth to Mrs. Mandela's allegations.
No reason has been given for the alleged beating of Seipei, although
there are numerous rivalries among black groups in the townships.
   Seipei is one of four people killed the last two months who had
direct or indirect links to either Mrs. Mandela or Mandela United.
   Seipei became an anti-apartheid activist at age 10, when he and a
friend formed the ``Under Fourteens'' in Tumahole.
   More than 1,000 youths served under Seipei's command in the
well-organized children's army, challenging local police and
pro-government vigilantes during the height of black township unrest
in 1985-86.
   ``The other groups were all talk and no action,'' the 4-foot
activist told a British journalist in 1987. ``We formed an army to
protect the people from harassment.''
   At age 11, he was detained for the first time, becoming the
youngest person held under state-of-emergency regulations.
   He learned chess and tried to keep up with studies that were
interrupted when he left primary school in 1986.
   Colleagues said his political awareness was remarkable, and he
could recite sections of important political documents by heart.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet foreign minister today called for
the removal of all foreign warships from the Persian Gulf and said
Moscow is ready to withdraw its fleet to help revive stalled
Iran-Iraq peace talks.
   The minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, said he expressed Moscow's
concern about the continued presence of U.S. and other Western
navies in the strategic waterway despite the 6-month-old cease-fire
in Iran-Iraq war.
   He later left for Tehran on the last leg of a 10-day, five-nation
Middle East tour and said he will hold talks with Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, who rarely meets with foreign dignitaries, on peace
efforts in the gulf region.
   But he did not say whether he would discuss Khomeini's death
sentence on British novelist Salman Rushdie whose prize-winning book
``The Satanic Verses'' is considered by Iran and other Moslem
nations to be offensive to Islam. Clerics in Iran have placed a $5.2
million bounty on the head of Rushdie, who was born a Moslem in
Bombay, India, but who now lives in London.
   Sources in London said on Friday that Britain has asked
Shevardnadze to press Iran to renounce its death threat. A source in
Britain's Foreign Office source said today that Britain has not
received a reply from the Soviets.
   Iran's reaction to Rushdie's novel was criticized by President
Bush and led Common Market countries to recall their senior
diplomats in Tehran in protest.
   After two days of talks with Iraqi leaders, Shevardnadze told a
news conference in Baghdad today: ``Our views were identical that
there is a need for joint eforts by all countries in the gulf to
clear the general atmosphere and maintain security in the area.''
   Speaking in Russian through an interpreter, Shevardnadze said an
international agreement could be reached by all parties using the
gulf with full guarantees from the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council: the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain,
China and France.
   Sheverdnadze's call appeared to be directed primarily at the
United States, which has reduced its fleet in the gulf region but
still has 23 warships there. The Soviets have a much smaller naval
force in the waterway. Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands, which
sent naval flotillas into the gulf in July 1987 to support U.S.
moves to protect shipping, have all withdrawn their ships.
   France still has some mine sweepers in the gulf, but Britain
plans to withdraw the last of its mine sweepers in the next week or
two.
   Iran has repeatedly demanded the withdrawal of foreign navies.
   Shevardnadze said: ``I will not rule out that the parties
benefiting from the gulf will conclude an agreement on how to
implement their international obligations within a common order
agreed upon by all.''
   He said he agreed with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and other
Iraqi leaders on ways of solving the problem of the foreign naval
presence in the waterway. But he did not elaborate.
   U.N.-mediated peace talks between Iran and Iraq have been stalled
since the Aug. 20 cease-fire on a variety of issues, including a
dispute over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway which flows along their
border.

<HEAD>Britain Says Other Countries to Pull Envoys From Iran</HEAD>

nations he named, Japan refusing to ban book, Malaysia banning it. No pickup.</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British official today said other countries have
agreed to join the 12 Common Market nations in withdrawing their
ambassadors from Iran to protest Tehran's death threat against
novelist Salman Rushdie.
   Sir Geoffrey Howe, the foreign secretary, said Austria, Finland
``and a number of other countries'' he did not identify had decided
to remove their top envoys from Tehran.
   He spoke in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview from
Tokyo, where he attended the funeral of Emperor Hirohito and met
with representatives of other nations to ask support of the
diplomatic moves engineered by Britain.
   Austria's ambassador to Tehran, Herbert Traxl has been
vacationing in Vienna since Monday, said government officials, who
would not say whether he would be withdrawn.
   Finland has called Iran's ambassador to Helsinki to protest the
death threat. There was no immediate comment from government
officials on whether Finland's ambassador would be recalled.
   Howe also mentioned Norway, Sweden and Canada, but they already
have recalled envoys for consulations.
   Rushdie, who was born a Moslem in Bombay, India, is a naturalized
British citizen who now lives in London. He has been hiding under
police protection since Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
called on others last week to kill him, saying his novel ``The
Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam. Iranian clerics offered a bounty
of up to $5.2 million for Rushdie's death.
   Official sources said Friday that Britain had asked Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to press Iran to renounce its
death threat when he meets Khomeini during a visit to Iran today. A
Foreign Office source said today that Britain had not received a
reply from the Soviets.
   Rushdie, 41, has said he did not intend to slander Islam, but he
nevertheless issued a public apology for any offense his novel has
caused Moslems, who have protested worldwide against the book.
   Police patrolled Bombay today to prevent further violence there,
and protests against the book were reported in northern England and
in Malaysia.
   Howe said in today's interview that several Moslem countries had
made clear ``they certainly would not go along with the type of
conduct which we complained of in Iran.'' He cited Pakistan as an
example of a Moslem country that ``has been prepared to uphold the
rule of law against violent protest.''
   ``I think that's a measure of the way in which the rest of the
world does not want to associate itself with the wholly
unjustifiable, intemperate incitements to murder that have emerged
from Iran,'' Howe said.
   At least seven people were killed Feb. 12-13 in protests in
Pakistan and in India's northern Jammu-Kashmir state. The book has
been banned in Pakistan, South Africa, Bangladesh, Iran, India and
Egypt.
   Malaysia also banned the novel today.
   In Bombay, India, police today fanned out in large numbers across
the city to prevent further violence after street protests against
the novel left at least nine people dead and 40 injured on Friday.
   Initial news reports said up to 12 died in protests over the
book, but a police commissioner, S.M. Shangari, said eight people
died in the rioting and one man died later in the hospital. Peaceful
protest also were reported Friday in New Delhi, Calcutta and several
other Indian cities.
   The governing Congress Party of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of
India today denounced the death threat against Rushdie. Press Trust
of India quoted Party General Secretary K.N. Singh as saying: ``We
always deprecate violence and terrorism of all kinds, individual or
state.''
   In response to the death calls by Khomeini, the 12 nations of the
European Economic Community earlier this week recalled their top
envoys from Iran, and London has shut down its mission in Tehran.
Iran retaliated by pulling its ambassadors out of the Common Market
nations. Besides Britain, the Common Market nations include Belgium,
France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Denmark,
Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.
   Japan's foreign minister, Sousuke Uno, said Friday he opposes any
international leader's advocacy of murder but that his nation has no
plans to withdraw its ambassador from Iran.
   Uno said, however, that the topic probably will come up when he
meets on Sunday with Iranian Vice President Mostafa Mir Salim.

<HEAD>Facsimile Machines Spark Calls for Regulation Against Junk Fax Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAL SPENCER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Facsimile machines, those beeping little
devices increasingly used to send everything from office memos to
Valentine greetings, are sparking demands for laws against ``fax
attacks.''
   Washington State is one of at least eight states considering
proposals to curb what critics say is a rising tide of ``junk fax''
_ printed advertisements that pop up unsolicited on office and home
fax machines.
   Fax owners and dealers told a legislative panel here recently
that the machines, which owners tend to leave hooked up to phone
lines 24 hours a day, are completely vulnerable to ``fax attacks''
of unwanted advertisements.
   Transmissions, which take an average of a minute per page, can
tie up a machine and prevent the sending or receiving of desired
documents, said Lee Bowman, a facsimile machine salesman who
supports regulation. The receiver also has to pay for the paper the
incoming advertisement is printed on, whether it's wanted or not.
   ``This is the ultimate in abusive use of a private communication
system,'' complained Rep. Ken Jacobsen, a Democrat from Seattle who
is sponsoring a measure to restrict junk fax transmissions. ``You
get a message you didn't want from people you don't know on paper
they didn't buy.''
   His researcher, Deborah Senn, said other states considering
similar legislation are Connecticut, Oregon, California, Michigan,
Minnesota, New York and Maryland. About 2 million of the devices
have been sold in the United States in the last few years, she said,
and their popularity is growing.
   The junk fax problem seems to be on the verge of exploding,
Jacobsen said.
   But Bill McCue, president of Public FAX, an Orange, Calif.,
publisher of a fax directory and trade magazine, contends the
problem is largely a creation of news organizations. Because public
relations people like to send releases by fax, he said, the media
appear to be the one group that does suffer an inundation of junk
fax.
   For everyone else, he said, the media are ``making a monumental
problem out of nothing. It's a cheap shot. It really is.''
   Donna Murdoch, executive director of the American Facsimile
Association in Philadelphia, agreed that the problem is overstated.
   ``We ask people, `How many pieces of junk fax are you really
getting?''' she said. ``And people say the most they can remember
getting is two pieces in a week.''
   But Jacobsen asserted that if junk fax is not a major problem
now, it soon will be. He noted that one computer maker already is
marketing a device that can dial randomly and automatically send
advertisements when a connection to a fax machine is made.
   ``My feeling is, let's nip junk fax in the bud before it becomes
big business and we're accused of trying to destroy an industry,''
he said.
   Jacobsen's measure, whic is expected to clear the House soon and
head for the Senate, would require senders of commercial
solicitations to get advance permission from the intended receiver.
Violators could face civil action that could net the unwilling
recipient of the junk fax up to $500.
   McCue called the proposal, which is similar to legislation being
considered in Oregon and Connecticut, ``lunacy.'' But Bowman said he
and colleagues think it's reasonable.
   Bowman said the junk problem ``is only going to grow here, just
as it already has in Japan,'' where fax machines are so popular that
coin-operated units can be found in restaurants and hotels.
   ``They turn their machines off at night in Japan now because of
the junk fax,'' Bowman said.
   He told the House committee that junk fax advertisers are
offering prizes in exchange for the telephone numbers of fax
machines. ``The numbers are worth money to these people,'' he said.
``In the next five or 10 years, junk fax could get real bad,
especially once fax machines start getting into households.''
   McCue said the advertising industry can better keep a lid on the
problem through self-regulation. He is pushing advertisers to follow
his ``Rules of Fax Etiquette,'' such as transmitting only during
off-hours and condensing the message to save time and paper.
   ``The golden rule of fax is: Fax unto others as you would have
them fax unto you,'' McCue said.

   More than a dozen men armed with sticks and
pipes chased a 20-year-old transient for two blocks through the
heart of downtown before beating and stabbing him to death, police
said.
   Authorities declined to speculate on why the man, whose name was
withheld pending notification of relatives, was slain. However,
officers noted the killing took place in an area known for
drug-dealing where a similar slaying by an angry mob took place last
month after a drug deal soured.
   ``In that case, it was definitely a drug deal gone bad,'' said
police Detective John Dunkin.
   The latest victim had apparently argued with a group of about 15
men shortly before he was killed and robbed of an undisclosed sum of
money about 1 a.m. Friday.
   He was stabbed eight or nine times, robbed and left to die,
Dunkin said.
   Officers arrested four men seen running from the scene. The men,
identified as James Turner, 19; Adrian Norris, 19; Robert Riley, 18;
and Gerald Jackson, 25, were held without bail for investigation of
murder, Dunkin said.

<HEAD>Battle Looms Over Racketeering Law as Business Pushes for Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Responding to concern over organized crime,
lawmakers in 1970 gave prosecutors a powerful weapon to use against
mobsters and racketeers who prey on business, labor and consumers.
   Nineteen years later, however, business executives are saying the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) is often
used against them in a fashion never intended by Congress. They want
it changed.
   ``We are just interested in bringing some sense to this much
abused statute,'' says Washington attorney Jack Quinn, who is
pushing for overhaul of RICO on behalf of State Farm Insurance Co.
   Capitol Hill is watching carefully as a well-heeled business
coalition prepares for a showdown with consumer groups over issue.
   ``It may be that it's being used in some places in civil actions
when maybe it shouldn't be,'' Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said last
week.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., told the same Senate subcommittee
session he knew of one brokerage firm facing a potential
million-dollar bill for duplicating documents to defend a RICO civil
suit filed by a disgruntled investor.
   ``Everybody who loses money these days wants to sue the brokerage
firm,'' Bumpers said. ``I don't want to jeopardize this legitimate
law enforcement tool, but that (case) is obviously outrageous.''
   The dispute over the law itself, however, is not that simple.
   Consumer advocates are sending out storm warnings. The bill
contains special provisions for the scandal-ridden securities and
commodity industries.
   The savings and loan industry, reeling from fraud and
mismanagement, could also benefit from key provisions of the bill,
which went into the hopper for the third time in as many years last
week.
   ``This legislation weakening RICO comes at the worst possible
time _ in the middle of an unprecedented corporate crime wave,''
consumer advocate Ralph Nader says. ``This is no time for members of
Congress to be soft on corporate crime.''
   Sponsored in the House by Rep. Frederick Boucher, D-Va., the bill
would leave much praised criminal provisions of the law untouched.
But it would make major changes in civil provisions that permit
victims of racketeering and other frauds to receive triple damages
if they win their lawsuits.
   More than 2,500 civil lawsuits were filed in federal courts
nationwide under the RICO statute between Nov. 1, 1985, and last
June 30. This explosion combined with concerns in the business
community over just how far it might go has fueled the campaign
soften the measure's civil provisions.
   ``Civil RICO is truly a statute run rampant,'' says Boucher. ``It
was intended for use against persons involved in organized crime,
but its actual use has been almost exclusively against the business
community.''
   ``In the past, plaintiffs have used the civil provisions of RICO,
and its treble damage penalty, in ordinary contract and commercial
litigation _ circumstances far removed from the intent of Congress
to strike at organized crime,'' says Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, one
of the Senate sponsors of legislation to change the law.
   Under the bill, federal, state and local governments would still
be able to collect triple damages in any case.
   Consumers also would be able to collect triple damages,
consisting of actual damages plus twice that amount in punitive
damages as well as court costs and attorneys fees. But here there
are exceptions.
   Investors hurt by insider stock trading could collect triple
damages under the bill. But the scandal that has battered Wall
Street's arbitrage and junk bond empires includes many alleged
offenses besides insider trading.
   Investors filing RICO suits in these other cases would be able to
collect no more than actual damages under the bill.
   The same would hold for those who suffered losses as a result of
fraud in the currently unfolding FBI investigation of the Chicago
commodity futures markets.
   Those other than governments and ``consumers'' filing civil suits
would be able to collect no more than actual damages unless the
defendant had been convicted of a felony for the conducted alleged
in the civil suit.
   In any case, a second court proceeding would be needed to
determine the question of triple damages or some lesser amount of
punitive damages.
   ``The result,'' says Pamela Gilbert, director of consumer
programs for the Capitol Hill-based U.S. Public Interest Research
Group, ``will be few if any civil RICO suits.''
   Moreover, consumer advocates wince at a provision of the bill
that could open the door to denying punitive damages in hundreds of
RICO suits already pending.
   And some in the legal community, such as Joseph W. Cuneo, general
counsel of the National Association of Securities and Commercial Law
Attorneys, are concerned about the retroactive provision.
   ``For Congress to say, well, we made a mistake, and you have to
pay the price,'' is completely unfair.

   A record 2,116 people died in fires in Japan in
1988, and most fires were caused by hot plates and cigarettes, fire
officials said Saturday.
   In an annual report, the Fire Defense Agency said the death toll
was up 13.9 percent from the previous year. However, the total
number of fires _ 59,653 _ was the second lowest in a decade, it
said.
   Damage from fires totaled $1.1 billion, the lowest figure since
1979, the agency added.
   Of the fires, 7,146 originated in hot plates, the largest single
cause, while fires caused by cigarettes came second with 6,266.

   At least two people died and five were

   The explosion Thursday at Jatigembol village was caused by embers

   The blast occurred about 530 miles east of Jakarta.
   Antara said seven people, including two air force personnel, were
injured and two victims died later in a hospital. The others were
hospitalized in serious condition.

   Government troops have killed 145 rebel
fighters this year in the southern province of Inhambane, the
national news agency AIM reported Saturday.
   AIM said government forces have overrun seven bases in the
province that were held by the rebels of the Mozambique National
Resistance, AIM said, citing unidentified military sources.
   The guerrillas have been fighting the Marxist government since
1977. They have seriously damaged the economy with attacks on both
civilian and military targets.
   Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world, and the
war is the main cause of a nationwide food shortage that has left
about 6 million of the country's 15 million people in need of food
aid.

   About 100 people demonstrated at a downtown park
Saturday against Japanese militarism during World War II and
denounced the late Japanese Emperor Hirohito as a war criminal.
   The protesters, chanting slogans and carrying banners, also
accused the Japanese government of rewriting school textbooks to
gloss over Japanese wartime atrocities.
   The demonstrators, who claimed they represented students,
academic and labor organizations, said they were concerned that
Japan does not recognize its responsibility for the war.
   After the half-hour rally, the protesters marched to the Japanese
Consulate, where they handed in a petition accusing the Japanese
government of rewriting the history of the war.
   Historians generally regard Hirohito, who died Jan. 7, as just a
figurehead, although the war was waged in his name. Hirohito was
buried Saturday.
   Hong Kong was occupied by the Japanese during the war.

   A fatal house fire that authorities say
was caused by an improperly installed baseboard heater has led to
the arrest of the electrician who hooked up the unit.
   Richard Salz, 48, was arrested Friday and charged with
second-degree manslaughter. He was released on $1,000 bond pending a
March 6 court appearance.
   ``I'm not a criminal. It was a faulty heater,'' said Salz, owner
of Salz &amp; Son Electrical &amp; General Contractors. ``These people are
looking for something that is not there.''
   Burton Gorman III, 13, of East Haven died in a fire Dec. 28. The
boy was found dead of smoke inhalation in his second-floor bedroom
in the home he shared with his grandparents, his father and a
brother.
   The fire was caused by a ``meltdown'' in a basement heating unit
that was improperly wired, said Deputy Police Chief William Hubbard.
   Joe Toscano, an inspector with the New Haven state's attorney's
office, said he knew of no other cases in the state in which an
electrician has been held responsible for a fire death.
   More than a dozen electrical code violations, including the
absence of a ground wire, were discovered in the six-foot baseboard
heating unit Salz installed in the Gorman home, Toscano said.
   ``He did not install that unit using sound electrical practices.
If this were just a case of mistakenly doing one thing, I don't
think we would be here today,'' Toscano said.
   Salz said he performed the work in August as an individual, and
not as part of a contract with his company.
   ``All I did was install it under the instructions of the
homeowners. There is no way anyone can hold me responsible here,''
he said.
   To prove second-degree manslaughter, Toscano said, prosecutors
will have to show that as a licensed electrician, Salz should have
known that what he was doing posed a fire hazard but went ahead
anyway.

<HEAD>Bush Visits Seoul Amid Growing Anti-U.S. Mood</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush visits South Korea on
Monday at a time when anti-American sentiment is growing
dramatically, with many Koreans demanding sweeping changes in
relations with their closest ally.
   During a brief visit, Bush is expected to discuss ways to reduce
friction and to review the friendship. U.S. and South Korean
officials say relations are excellent, but they want to ensure
anti-American sentiment does not threaten their ties.
   Anti-Americanism has mushroomed among groups ranging from radical
students to conservative farmers, all accusing the United States of
exploiting South Korea. Complaints range from claims of military
occupation to unfair trade pressure and cultural insensitivity.
   As South Korea has become stronger in recent years, growing
nationalism and resentment of some U.S. policies have aggravated
anti-American sentiment, analysts say. The United States also has
been singled out as a target by anti-government groups trying to
gain support by whipping up nationalist sentiment, they say.
   Koreans resent ``U.S. interference in domestic politics and
economy in a high-handed manner, its support for dictatorship, and
its coercive demands to open Korean markets,'' the Chosun Ilbo
newspaper said in a recent editorial.
   The change has been sudden and dramatic in a nation that saw the
United States as a savior for coming to its aid during the Korean
War. Many Koreans remain friendly toward the United States, analysts
say, but anti-American sentiment is becoming embedded among some
groups, especially younger people.
   Nationalistic pride is particularly strong among those who have
no memories of how U.S. troops helped save the South from a North
Korean invasion in 1950, analysts say.
   ``They (the young) demand enhanced sense of national identity,
expecting their country to play an active role independent from
foreign pressures, not the role which resulted in humiliating
national tragedy,'' The Korea Herald said in a Feb. 19 editorial.
   Many South Koreans, proud of the enormous gains their nation has
made in becoming one of Asia's economic powerhouses, feel the United
States has failed to recognize their strength and growing role in
the world. The United States, many Koreans say, treats South Korea
as an underling, when it should regard Seoul as an equal.
   Radical students seeking the fall of President Roh Tae-woo claim
his government is a military dictatorship controlled by the United
States. Radical leaders demand the removal of the 42,000 U.S. troops
based in South Korea, claiming the United States is blocking
reunification with communist North Korea.
   Students and other dissidents have mounted a wave of violent
anti-U.S. protests since 1988 and attacked U.S. diplomatic offices
and military bases with homemade explosives and firebombs.
   ``It is a fact we cannot ignore that the United States and its
proxy ruling force (the South Korean government) are primarily
responsible for all our country's problems and divisions,'' said a
radical student leader, who declined to be named.
   Such radicals reject the broad democratic reforms introduced by
Roh with strong American support since 1987. But the students have
little public support because of their extremism.
   Some opposition parties reject the radicals' violent tactics but
also criticize the United States for backing the authoritarian
regimes that have dominated South Korea for much of its history.
   ``The fundamental cause of anti-Americanism is American attitudes
in the past,'' Kim Dae-jung, head of the main opposition Party for
Peace and Democracy, said in an interview.
   Opposition leaders want an end to any major U.S. role in internal
affairs, including American command over most of the South Korean
armed forces and the special status exempting U.S. soldiers from
local prosecution in some criminal cases.
   Yet all opposition parties favor close ties with Washington and
agree the United States should be their principal ally. Opinion
polls indicate a majority of South Koreans want U.S. troops to
remain as long as there is a threat from North Korea.
   Anti-American sentiment also has been stirred by U.S. pressure on
Seoul to open South Korean markets to American imports and help
reduce Washington's trade debt with Seoul, which was $8.6 billion in
1988. Farmers opposed to any U.S. imports have staged violent
protests, and some Koreans fear the United States is trying to
cripple South Korea's economy.
   South Korean officials agree the opposition to American imports
is unfair given the open access South Korea has to U.S. markets. But
they argue South Korea is a developing nation and Washington should
consider Korean feelings.
   ``The American authorities seem to take it for granted that
people also think and behave in the same way as Americans do,'' said
political analyst Kim Byong-kui.

<HEAD>Scientists Identify Part Of Brain Involved In Anxiety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   That anxiety and fear you feel when the dentist
says ``open up,'' or a police officer behind you turns on his red
light, triggers a reaction in the brain that has been measured for
the first time by scientists at Washington University in Saint Louis.
   The researchers tricked eight volunteers into a fearful
anticipation of pain from an electrical shock and then measured the
blood flow in their brains. The results for the first time
established the specific location of an emotion in the brain.
   Dr. Eric Reiman of Washington University said Friday in a
telephone interview that eight normal volunteers, being monitored by
a system called positron emission tomography (PET), were told they
would receive a painful shock through wires attached to their hands
some time during a two-minute period.
   The volunteers experienced a state of anxiety for 40 seconds
while anticipating the pain, and then they received a mild shock.
   Reiman said during those 40 seconds of anticipation, the PET
instrument detected a sharply increased flow of blood to the left
and right temporal lobes of the brain. These are located just behind
the eyes and just inside the temples.
   ``The reason regional blood flow is of interest is that it
actually reflects the activity of brain cells,'' said Reiman.
``Measurements of blood flow is a good way of identifying the
regions of the brain that are turned on during various thoughts,
feelings and behaviors.''
   PET works by detecting and measuring the very short-lived
radiation from a tracer injected into the blood stream just before
the test begins. The detectable radiation lasts only two minutes.
   Three scans were taken with each volunteer _ the first to get a
baseline without anxiety, the second when the anxiety was induced
and a third scan for a follow-up comparison.
   Reiman said that by inducing anxiety in the volunteers, the
researchers were able to compare the blood flow pattern in normal,
anxious brains with that of patients who experience panic disorder,
an emotional illness that includes unprovoked and inappropriate
feelings of great fear and anxiety.
   In earlier PET studies, he said, the researchers learned that
patients with panic disorder also experience a sharply increased
flow of blood to the temporal lobes of the brain, the same areas
affected by the normal anxiety felt among the volunteers in the
study. This finding, said Reiman, gives important new information
that may be a first step toward eventual control of panic disorder.
   ``When we identify the regions of the brain that are functioning
abnormally in panic disorder, hopefully we will be able to design
and target treatments that specifically address those parts of the
brain,'' he said.
   The same technique may be used in exploring which parts of the
brain are involved in other feelings.
   ``I do believe we'll be able to develop procedures to induce
other normal emotions in the laboratory and identify portions of the
brain involved in sadness or joy or anger,'' said Reiman.
   Understanding the physical effects of these emotions could lead
to treatments for other disorders, he said.
   Participating in the research with Reiman were Drs. Marcus
Raichle and Peter Fox, and Maureen Fusselman, all of Washington
University.
   A report on the study was published Friday in Science, the
journal of the American Association for the Advance of Science.

   Riot troops in at least six cities
broke up violent protests Saturday by radicals yelling ``Bush go
home!'' and the government put 120,000 police on alert to prepare
for the president's visit.
   Students hurling firebombs and rocks battled riot police in minor
running clashes in some provincial cities. Thousands of riot police
blocked demonstrations, often forming a human wall with shields to
disperse protesters. Dissident groups had called for nationwide
protests Saturday to demand the fall of President Roh Tae-woo's
government and to protest Bush's visit Monday. But turnout was small
and riot police overwhelmed the few thousand people who took part.
   Authorities said police would remain on top alert because
dissidents have called for more protests Monday. Radicals are
demanding an end to close ties with the United States and removal of
42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.
   The nation's largest dissident alliance, the United National
Democratic Movement of Korea, demanded Bush cancel a visit it said
was designed to bolster the Roh government. Bush is to visit Seoul
for about five hours to hold talks with Roh and address the National
Assembly.
   ``The United States is scheming, through Bush's visit, to
perpetuate the division of the Korean peninsula, stabilize the
military dictatorship and heighten tensions,'' the movement said.
   About 50 students broke through a police guard and threw
firebombs and rocks at a district office of the governing Democratic
Justice Party in southern Seoul. They also firebombed another of the
party's offices in the southern city of Yosu, said Yonhap, the
Korean news agency.
   A few hundred radicals braved heavy rain and a massive police
presence to demonstrate in downtown Seoul. Police arrested about 70
protesters.
   ``Kick out the Americans!'' the radical students shouted.
   About 100 dissidents rallied inside a downtown Seoul church.
   Police fired tear gas to break up a rally of 200 students near
Seoul railway station.
   About 500 more protesters shouted slogans at South Gate, one of
Seoul's ancient city gates, but police dispersed them and arrested
some.
   In the provincial city of Kwangju, riot police blocked a planned
rally, and students and farmers armed with rocks and firebombs
fought running battles with police, who fired tear gas, Yonhap said.
Minor clashes also were reported in the central city of Chungju and
Masan in the south.
   In the southern city of Chonju, about 200 students staged an
anti-government rally and attacked two police stations, smashing
several windows and setting fire to telephones and furniture, Yonhap
said. Farmers and students later staged separate street protests.

   Teachers found Soviet infantry
ammunition in the pockets and bags of schoolchildren attending a
primary school in western Hungary, state television reported.
   The schoolchildren bought the ammunition from Soviet soldiers for
less than one cent per bullet, the broadcast said Friday night.
   Endre Marko, the principal of the school in Gyoer, said the
teachers collected ``a sizeable amount'' of ammunition from the
children.
   Prosecutor Imre Bocsi said the students and local Soviet military
officials would be questioned to determine why bullets were sold to
children.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino pledged
Saturday to unite the nation and begin ``the ways of peace'' as
Filipinos marked the third anniversary of the popular uprising that
brought her to power and toppled Ferdinand Marcos.
   Several prominent Filipinos boycotted the celebrations because of
disappointment with Mrs. Aquino. Police opened fire to drive off
about 3,000 Marcos supporters demanding their leader's return from
Hawaiian exile.
   The military arrested three suspected right-wing extremists in a
van filled with 30 cases of explosives outside the capital.
   Mrs. Aquino, who returned Saturday from the funeral of Japan's
Emperor Hirohito, said President Bush and other international
leaders ``told me that they admire us Filipinos for that non-violent
revolution.''
   She made her comments following a Roman Catholic Mass along
Epifanio delos Santos Avenue, where hundreds of thousands of
civilians turned out three years ago to protect soldiers who
mutinied against Marcos.
   Police estimated Saturday's crowd at 30,000, smaller than the
last two anniversaries.
   ``I think it is up to the leaders of your country to initiate the
ways of peace,'' Mrs. Aquino told the crowd. ``I hope you will be
patient with us because we are in a transition period. I promise
that this day, we will unite and do a better job in serving you.''
   Cardinal Jaime L. Sin said before Mrs. Aquino's speech that
corruption and political bickering were diverting attention from
eradicating poverty and social injustice.
   ``The old politics have come back to the dismay of us all _
positioning for power, the corruption, the grandstanding, the
influence-peddling, the petty bickering,'' he said.
   Shooting erupted at a separate rally in Manila by about 3,000
Marcos loyalists, who demanded Marcos be allowed to return from
Honolulu, where he has been exiled since his 20-year rule ended Feb.
25, 1986.
   Witnesses said three plainclothed policemen bolted from a vehicle
and forced one Marcos supporter inside. When protesters rushed the
car, the policemen fired in the air and sped away, the witnesses
said.
   Police spokesman Albert Gatos said he and two fellow officers
were transporting a robbery suspect when the loyalists attacked
their car. Gatos said one loyalist was arrested.
   Saturday's celebrations began with the ringing of church bells
across this island nation and included fireworks, street dancing and
unveiling of a giant statue of the Virgin Mary.
   Among those boycotting the celebrations was Sen. Juan Ponce
Enrile, the former defense minister who led the military mutiny
against Marcos but then turned against Mrs. Aquino as well.
   ``They really wanted change for the country,'' said Enrile, who
was fired as defense minister in November 1986 after a coup attempt
by his followers. ``Our future is still dim.''
   But Defense Minister Fidel Ramos, another figure in the
anti-Marcos revolt, said the government needs more time to achieve
its goals.
   On Saturday, the military said two soldiers and one civilian were
arrested outside the capital in a van packed with 30 cases of
explosives. A senior officer said the three were believed linked to
right-wing extremists.
   Lt. Col. Manuel Oxales said the three were arrested late Friday
in Taytay, a few miles from the celebration site.

   Thousands of people, some curious, some just
trapped in the throng, were on the streets Saturday as President
Bush was welcomed in Beijing.
   ``Look at all those cars,'' 4-year-old Gao Xiaofeng gushed as the
presidential motorcade cruised down Changan Street, Beijing's main
boulevard.
   ``I remember seeing the new president on his bicycle in Beijing
15 years ago,'' said the boy's father, Gao Feng. ``He certainly is
traveling differently now.''
   At Tiananmen Square, in the heart of Beijing, the president and
Mrs. Bush stepped out of their car and greeted ordinary Chinese
citizens.
   Onlookers applauded them. The Bushes stayed on the square for two
minutes and posed for photos. They then sped to the state guest
house, Diaoyutai, for a welcoming ceremony with Premier Li Peng.
   Amid the commotion, some Chinese acknowledged they didn't know
George Bush.
   ``Bush?'' said a puzzled university student. ``I thought Ronald
Reagan was coming to China.''
   Others couldn't recognize the Stars and Stripes, which was hung
side-by side with China's flag along the huge square.
   ``That must be the flag of Pakistan,'' said an elderly woman.
   But one bystander, Zhang Jun, said he thought Bush was ``a real
gentleman. I hope his visit makes Chinese-American relations even
better.''
   ``So do I,'' added Wang Luo, leaning on his bicycle, ``but he's
making me late for dinner.''
   Indeed, about 20 minutes before the motorcade drove by, police
stopped all traffic on Beijing's main boulevard. Thousands of
bicycling commuters joined curious passers-by as they waited on the
sidewalk for the president to pass.
   ``I'd like to strangle these bureaucrats to death for shutting
the city down for another big potato,'' yelled one man, as he
balanced his son on his handlebars. ``My boy is sick and the cold is
bad for his health.''
   ``Let's move it, let's go,'' others yelled as the throng surged
forward.
   Police did not let people go on their way until 10 minutes after
the motorcade passed.
   Bush, who headed the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing in 1974 and
1975, is well-liked in China, a country that puts much emphasis on
personal relations. Bush and his wife, Barbara, are famed in Beijing
for their bicycle excursions around the city.
   On bustling Wangfujing Street, there was less interest in their
return.
   ``I don't have much to say about Mr. Bush,'' said one woman as
she juggled several bags of spinach, onions and meat. ``I have to
run home and cook.''

   President Bush was looking Sunday to advance
efforts to promote peace in Cambodia, meeting with Cambodian
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk during his visit to
Beijing.
   Both the president and the flamboyant prince are staying in
villas at the secluded Diaoyutai guest house, which served as a
retreat for Chinese emperors for 800 years.
   Sihanouk, who has been living at the guest house for more than a
month, has spent the past decade wandering in exile in Beijing,
North Korea and Paris. He has frequently quarreled with his
resistance partners but remains intent on ending Vietnam's 10-year
occupation of his country.
   The United States provides non-lethal assistance to Sihanouk's
faction and a second non-Communist opposition faction headed by Son
Sann.
   The third resistance force is the Khmer Rouge, infamous for its
fanatic rule from 1975 to 1978 that resulted in the deaths of 1
million Cambodians.
   Vietnam says it will not leave Cambodia until it is certain the
Khmer Rouge won't return to power. Bush has said he would press the
Chinese, the main supplier of arms to the Khmer Rouge, to ensure the
group is prevented from resuming its reign of terror.
   The resistance has held two rounds of talks in recent months with
the Vietnamese-installed government of Cambodia regarding the future
course of the country, but little progress was reported.
   Sihanouk, 66, was driven from the Cambodian throne in 1970 in a
coup he claimed was engineered by the Central Intelligence Agency.
   He took a strong anti-American stand and returned to his homeland
in 1975 when the Khmer Rouge gained power. But he was immediately
placed under house arrest and many of his family members were killed.
   He went into exile in 1979 when Vietnam invaded and has since
relied on China, Thailand and the West for support in the resistance
struggle.
   Earlier this month, in an exchange of letters with the new
Secretary of State, James A. Baker III, Sihanouk said: ``We
Cambodian patriots ask the United States to play a more important
and active role in the search for a fair solution to the problem of
Cambodia.''
   Baker wrote, ``without question, your leadership is crucial to
achieving an acceptable Cambodian settlement'' and urged Sihanouk to
remain involved in efforts to reach a settlement in his country.
   Several days later Sihanouk, who had quit his official positions
with the resistance a year earlier following a dispute with the
Khmer Rouge, announced he was resuming his post of president of the
resistance.

   While President Bush meets the leaders of modern
China, Barbara Bush planned a Sunday tour of the nation's imperial
past, visiting the walled compound of the last emperor and the vast
Forbidden City.
   Although the U.S. first lady lived in the Chinese capital city
for more than a year when her husband served as U.S. liaison officer
in the mid-1970s, the two primary sites on her itinerary were not
open for viewing at that time.
   After attending a Saturday banquet at the Great Hall of the
People and a Sunday morning church service with the president, Mrs.
Bush was scheduled to go off on her own _ and travel north of
Beijing to tour the Mansion of the Regent Prince.
   The elegant and traditional walled compound was the home of the
Xuangtong Emperor, better known as Pu Yi, who spent the first three
years of his life there before ascending the throne.
   Pu Yi, whose life was told in the award-winning 1987 movie ``The
Last Emperor,'' was enthroned in 1909 at the age of 3, but a
revolution three years later forced him to abdicate.
   His family mansion alongside a northern Beijing lake is guarded
by huge red doors and an ornate gate, and remains off limits to
ordinary sightseers.
   Like dozens of other aristocratic mansions of old Beijing, it was
taken over by the Communists who took power in 1949. Now, it houses
the Public Health Ministry.
   Its stately halls have been divided into tiny offices where
hundreds of bureaucrats work under dim light bulbs.
   However, Mrs. Bush was to have tea and watch a music and dance
program in a separate reception area with about 30 Chinese women.
Among those invited are Premier Li Peng's wife, Zhu Lin.
   In the afternoon, Mrs. Bush was to view a newly opened exhibit on
Pu Yi's life in the imperial palace in the heart of Beijing, known
as the Forbidden City.
   Inside two faded wooden halls in a small inner courtyard of the
vast palace complex, the exhibit contains Pu Yi's English-made
bicyle, gramophone, childhood toys, set of Encyclopaedia Britannica
and wedding robe, its multicolored silk threads still brilliant 67
years later.
   It also includes a small piano on which Pu Yi sometimes composed
traditional-style tunes, and a taped recording of one, titled
``Generals On A Southern Expedition,'' that is played repeatedly for
visitors.
   ``On the day peace is restored, my gentlemen, I shall bid you
return and divest you of your battle robes,'' Pu Yi wrote in the
lyrics.
   For Pu Yi and the feeble forces of monarchial restoration,
however, there was no victory, even though he continued to live in
the palace for 12 years after abdicating.
   The exhibit is a poignant testimony to the aimlessness and futile
hopes of those 12 years. Pictures show him in full court dress
seated on a throne during a brief period when he hoped for
restoration, and later taking the throne as the puppet ruler of a
Japanese-created kingdom of Manchukuo in northeast China.
   Finally, he is shown in padded peasant clothing, exercising with
other prisoners in a Communist prison for war criminals.
   Mrs. Bush's itinerary is very different from Nancy Reagan's, who
visited the city in 1984.
   During her two-day tour, Mrs. Reagan toured the Beijing Zoo, a
temple where emperors once offered sacrifices for good harvests, an
acupuncture clinic and a kindergarten. Mrs. Reagan also had tea at
the home of a teacher.

   The security demands of the U.S. Secret Service
bewildered and dismayed a Beijing church pastor, who was greeting
President Bush and his wife Barbara at a special Sunday morning
church service.
   First the agents wanted to examine several Chinese-language
Bibles and hymnals that the Rev. Kan Xueqing and his fellow
ministers planned to give the Bushes. Then they demanded the church
doors be closed to worshippers more than an hour before the start of
the service.
   The security officials also had initially insisted that church
members not to be told of the service until two days beforehand _
when in a practically telephone-less society, it would be difficult
to get word out.
   The restrictions were modified slightly after Kan expressed
concerns about impingement on local customs.
   Western ministers might have expected such demands. But to the
67-year-old Kan, who most of his career has faced athiest communist
restrictions on worship, the security precautions were
incomprehensible.
   ``It has been very difficult. I was upset,'' Kan said Friday as
White House technicians installed lights and sound equipment in the
86-year-old brick Chongwenmen Protestant Church.
   ``They want to close off all the entrances to the street leading
to our church. The freedom of our believers to come to church to
worship will be restricted,'' he said. After decades of communist
suppression, that is a freedom Chinese Christians don't take
lightly, he said.
   ``I never thought the United States would give us this problem,''
Kan added. ``Maybe atheists would.''
   Kan's church, located in a walled compound down a narrow alley,
is one of six Protestant churches serving the Beijing metropolitan
area. Its single service at 9:30 a.m. each Sunday usually is filled
to capacity with about 1,500 people.
   For the Bushes, the church planned a special, half-hour service
at 8 a.m.
   Kan said he was overjoyed when he learned Bush, a former
parisioner of his, was to come.
   The minister had conducted Sunday services for Beijing's small
foreign community in a former YMCA hall in the early 1970s. Bush and
his wife, Barbara, were regular worshippers during Bush's 1974-75
stint as head of the U.S. Liaison Office before full U.S.-Chinese
diplomatic ties were established.
   ``Some of this is the problem that (Kan) hoped it would be like
the old days when the Bushes rode up on their bicyles,'' said U.S.
Embassy spokesman Sheridan W. Bell. ``But he is president now.''
   During their stay in the 1970s, the Bushes were famous for their
penchant for riding bikes, the favorite Chinese mode of
transportation.
   Kan said he understood the Secret Service's responsibility to
protect Bush. But he added, ``I am a pastor. I am a friend of so
many years. I heard ministers are respected in U.S. society, not
like here, where you say, `I'm a pastor' and people say, `What's
that?'''
   His protests have been heeded. The White House sent him a letter
late this week, he said, assuring him it would respect Chinese
customs.
   The Secret Service backed off on examining the gift books and
agreed to keep the church doors open until half an hour before the
service.
   They also let him announce the service half a day earlier so he
could tell church members who came to a Thursday night prayer
service.
   White House staffers ``are trying to be as sensitive and polite
as they can,'' Bell said.
   Kan said he prayed and decided he should understand the Secret
Service's viewpoint. ``Their thinking and mine are not the same,''
he said. ``They are doing it for Bush.''
   His hope, he said, was that Bush's attendance would stimulate
interest in Christianity in China.
   ``I believe God has arranged a very good opportunity to spread
the Gospel,'' in the officially atheist society, he said.

   President Bush was looking Sunday to advance
efforts to promote peace in Cambodia, meeting with Cambodian
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk during his visit to
Beijing.
   Both the president and the flamboyant prince are staying in
villas at the secluded Diaoyutai guest house, which served as a
retreat for Chinese emperors for 800 years.
   Sihanouk, who has been living at the guest house for more than a
month, has spent the past decade wandering in exile in Beijing,
North Korea and Paris. He has frequently quarreled with his
resistance partners but remains intent on ending Vietnam's 10-year
occupation of his country.
   The United States provides non-lethal assistance to Sihanouk's
faction and a second non-Communist opposition faction headed by Son
Sann.
   The third resistance force is the Khmer Rouge, infamous for its
fanatic rule from 1975 to 1978 that resulted in the deaths of 1
million Cambodians.
   Vietnam says it will not leave Cambodia until it is certain the
Khmer Rouge won't return to power. Bush has said he would press the
Chinese, the main supplier of arms to the Khmer Rouge, to ensure the
group is prevented from resuming its reign of terror.
   The resistance has held two rounds of talks in recent months with
the Vietnamese-installed government of Cambodia regarding the future
course of the country, but little progress was reported.
   Sihanouk, 66, was driven from the Cambodian throne in 1970 in a
coup he claimed was engineered by the Central Intelligence Agency.
   He took a strong anti-American stand and returned to his homeland
in 1975 when the Khmer Rouge gained power. But he was immediately
placed under house arrest and many of his family members were killed.
   He went into exile in 1979 when Vietnam invaded and has since
relied on China, Thailand and the West for support in the resistance
struggle.
   Earlier this month, in an exchange of letters with the new
Secretary of State, James A. Baker III, Sihanouk said: ``We
Cambodian patriots ask the United States to play a more important
and active role in the search for a fair solution to the problem of
Cambodia.''
   Baker wrote, ``without question, your leadership is crucial to
achieving an acceptable Cambodian settlement'' and urged Sihanouk to
remain involved in efforts to reach a settlement in his country.
   Several days later Sihanouk, who had quit his official positions
with the resistance a year earlier following a dispute with the
Khmer Rouge, announced he was resuming his post of president of the
resistance.

<HEAD>WHO Says Dirty Syringe Caused AIDS Outbreak in Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A World Health Organization official agrees with
Soviet conclusions that an unsterile syringe infected more than two
dozen children with the AIDS virus, Tass said Saturday.
   David Heimann, chief of the WHO epidemiological department, came
to the Soviet Union to help medical authorities track the source of
the virus discovered in 29 infants and six mothers in Elista, a city
near the Caspian Sea.
   ``Large-scale epidemiological studies helped find the cause of
the massive infection of the children _ an unsterilized syringe used
for injections at a maternity home,'' said Tass, the official Soviet
news agency.
   The virus itself, Tass said, ``was most probably brought by a man
who worked in one of the African countries eight years ago.''
   Not everyone infected with the AIDS virus contracts the deadly
disease.
   The news agency said Heimann ``received full information and did
not find any data contradicting the conclusions of the Soviet
national commission which held a probe into the accident.''
   It was not clear in the Tass report how the virus was transmitted
from the unidentified carrier, but earlier newspaper reports said
nurses at the maternity home had been reusing disposable syringes to
cover up the sale of unused needles to drug addicts.
   The toll of 29 infected infants in Elitsa is two more than
reported in January, and authorities are continuing to test hundreds
of infants who were treated in the hospital.
   Heimann offered the support of the international community,
saying, ``it would be useful to jointly work out methods of treating
the infected children and providing psychological support for their
mothers,'' Tass said.
   After long denying the existence of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome in the Soviet Union, officials acknowledged about three
years ago that Soviets have been infected and began a campaign
against the disease.
   Since 1987, it has been a crime in the Soviet Union to infect
anyone with the AIDS virus, and officials are investigating bringing
charges against medical personnel in the Elitsa case. Since the
presence of AIDS was acknowledged in the Soviet Union, officials
have reported that two people have died of the disease.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   The scientific name for the virus is human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV.

<TEXT>
   Central Americans who want political
asylum in the United States, but know their chances are slim under a
new policy, say they will wait in hiding in this border city until
they can cross the Rio Grande and elude federal agents.
   The number of Central Americans bothering to apply for asylum has
plummeted since last week when the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service toughened its stance on political asylum
applicants. The INS reported it processed 233 asylum applications
Tuesday, the first day of the get-tough procedure, and only 19 were
processed Friday; over that period, three were granted asylum.
   Border Patrol officials say the Central Americans are hiding
wherever they can until they believe they can cross illegally into
the United States.
   ``We think they're just lying low, maybe at hotels in Matamoros,
with alien-smugglers or with sympathizers,'' said Silvestre Reyes,
chief of the Border Patrol's McAllen sector.
   At a Catholic Church-run shelter named Casa Juan Diego, dozens of
Central Americans talked about why they fled their homelands and
about their long, difficult journeys during which they were robbed
and were forced to beg for rides and food.
   They also asked about the new INS rules, under which asylum
petitions can be denied in one day and the applicants then jailed
pending deportation, and how difficult it would be to reach
destinations like Los Angeles, Miami or New York.
   ``I don't know what we're going to do, but we'll find a way to
cross, no matter what the cost is,'' said 21-year-old Nicaraguan
Marta Salcedo, who arrived Monday with five other Nicaraguans.
   ``We don't want to go back to our own country. We'll be killed
because we are viewed as counter-revolutionaries,'' she said.
``We'll get to the other side somehow.''
   But U.S. Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley say
getting past them is going to be tough. More than 125 agents have
been sent to the district, bringing the total to 500. And they're
all working 12-hour shifts.
   Ms. Salcedo, whose father was an officer in the Anastasio Somoza
regime that was overthrown by the leftist Sandinistas, fled with her
family to Guatemala in September 1987 and began her journey to the
United States earlier this month.
   Fellow Nicaraguan Marina Espinoza and her three children said
they were robbed by police near Mexico City. They want to go to Los
Angeles to see the children's father, Vicente Espinoza, who filed
for asylum after entering the country more than a year ago.
   ``I just want to see my father and tell him that I love him very
much,'' said 6-year-old Eric Espinoza.
   Casa Juan Diego is just a concrete shell with a sparsely
furnished kitchen and sleeping quarters where mattresses and
blankets are placed on top of cinder blocks. Residents have a
maximum six-night stay and are provided one meal daily.
   The shelter, administered by the Rev. Oscar Lozano of the nearby
Our Lady of Lourdes Church, has helped more than 1,000 Central
Americans since it opened in the fall of 1987. It can house up to
130 people, but mostly sleeps 30 to 40 each night.
   Mexican officials know about the shelter but do not aggressively
seek out the Central Americans, said a Mexican immigration official
working at the church who asked that his name not be used.
   ``The government is not supposed to be helping these people, but
I have been working with the church for a long time and it's just
the Christian thing to do,'' the official said.
   Alien smugglers know about the facility too and try to persuade
the aliens to pay them for help in getting across the Rio Grande.
   ``They know the opportunity to make fast money is always there,''
Lozano has told reporters.
   Nearly all the 40 residents at the shelter Friday said they were
confused about the new U.S. immigration policy.
   ``We came real far and for them to close the door on us is not
fair,'' said Nelson Antonio Espinoza-Gonzalez, 18, of Nicaragua.
   ``Nicaragua is getting worse, politically, economically and
ideologically. It's all orders,'' said Alfonso Martinez, 29, a
former electronic engineer. ``My life would be in danger in
Nicaragua.''
   He said he had traveled too far to be deported.
   ``We will just wait here, maybe until the (U.S) law is changed or
until the American immigration gets tired of waiting for us,'' he
said.

   ``I know this guy!'' exclaimed President Bush as
he reached out Saturday to shake a Chinese hand in the crowd that
welcomed his return to Beijing.
   Bush's visit with his wife, Barbara, seemed one part diplomacy,
three parts nostalgic homecoming.
   It was the president's fifth trip to China _ and his wife's sixth
_ since he represented U.S. interests here as a special envoy in
1974-75, after President Nixon reopened Sino-American contacts but
before formal diplomatic relations were restored.
   The Bushes were clearly glad to be back, and Chinese officialdom
seemed pleased to have them.
   ``We're happy you're in China. We warmly welcome you,'' President
Yang Shangkun told Bush over toasts in the Great Hall of the People.
``Every time you came you tried to solve major issues.''
   From the airport, Bush rode directly to Tiananmen Square, where
the ancient imperial Forbiddden City sprawls on one side of an
eight-lane highway and the mausoleum of Chairman Mao Tse-tung the
other.
   Bush ordered his stretch Mercedes limousine stopped and he jumped
out to work the crowd.
   ``I know this guy!'' Bush called out, using one of a politician's
favorite salutations in a crowd. ``Good to see you all again!''
   The Chinese clapped, politely. Metal barriers held the citizenry
back. Several thousand bicyclists and pedestrians lined the street
along the motorcade route, but local Americans said many were there
not to see Bush but simply because traffic had been halted.
   It doesn't take much to create a crowd in Beijing, they said. All
you have to do is stop traffic for five minutes.
   Bush's stop, planned in advance, was outside the Gate of Heavenly
Peace and below a massive portrait of Mao Tse-tung. American flags
flew beside Chinese flags in red with five gold stars. Some in the
crowd waved tiny American flags.
   A government interpreter in a leather coat was asked how the
American flag happened to be flying there. ``Ask the American
embassy,'' she replied.
   Someone held aloft a small white sign that read ``Hello.''
   ``How are you?'' said Bush, reaching for hands. ``So nice to see
you.''
   ``It's warm here, warmer than I remember,'' he said.
   A hazy red sun hung low in the afternoon sky.
   Mrs. Bush, in a purple coat, seemed to be enjoying the moment,
too. ``I love China,'' she said on the plane from Tokyo. ``I had
very, very happy years there.''
   The first time they were in China was like seeing ``a black and
white movie,'' she said. ``Last time we were there, three or four
years ago, it was really an emerged nation.''
   Next stop was the Diaoyutai State Guest House, where Premier Li
Peng and tea awaited. Also gifts.
   Li remembered that the Bushes were fond of bicycling around
Beijing when he was head of the U.S. Liaison Office here. So he gave
them two bikes, one in lime green for Bush, a bright red one for
Mrs. Bush.
   ``What a beautiful present,'' Bush said. An aide handed him a
large, gold-wrapped box which Bush gave to Li. ``This is not nearly
as nice,'' the president said apologetically.
   Li handed the box to an aide who unwrapped it. The premier seemed
stunned by his gift, a pair of black cowboy boots. They were
handmade in Houston, with a Chinese flag on the front of one boot
and an American flag on the other boot.
   Ling said maybe he would wear the boots when he visited America.
``It's not a habit in China to have flags on the front,'' he said.
   There was an untold secret about the Bushes' gift of a pair of
Flying Pigeons, made by the Tianjin bicycle factory which turned out
China's first bikes and is a major producer.
   What went unmentioned was that the Xinhua News Agency reported
last Tuesday that Li Qizhu, a top executive of the bicycle factory,
had been charged with taking a $13,500 bribe for illegal shipments
of 11,000 bicycles and with profiteering on the sale of another 600
bikes.

   A passenger train derailed Saturday
after hitting a truck that had fallen from a bridge onto the tracks.
The truck driver called police, but they were unable to warn the
oncoming train.
   The train driver was slightly injured, but the truck driver and
the 11 passengers on the 5:59 a.m. Chester to Shrewsbury train
escaped unhurt, British Rail officials said.
   ``It's miraculous that no one was killed or seriously hurt,''
said Inspector Ian Kelman of Wrexham police, who was one of the
first to arrive on the scene. ``It could have been a lot, lot
worse.''
   The truck driver, who was unfamiliar with the area, telephoned
police to say his vehicle had toppled onto the train tracks
``somewhere in the Wrexham area.''
   Police raced around trying to find him and said they finally
found the truck on the tracks beneath Pandy Bridge on the outskirts
of Wrexham in about half an hour. But it was too late to warn the
train.
   Officers arrived at the scene minutes after the crash, which
ripped the rear axles off the 32-ton ton truck and pushed it 100
yards down the track, North Wales police said.
   The train driver brought the two-carriage diesel train to a halt
with the truck's axle, wheels and other debris embedded under the
engine. He was treated at a Chester hospital for a bruised knee,
police said.
   The truck apparently skidded on black ice on the Chester to
Wrexham road and crashed down a 30-foot embankment onto the tracks,
police said.
   The line was closed while British Rail engineers used a crane to
lift the diesel unit. British Rail said the accident was under
investigation.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At one moment during the trial of
playwright Vaclav Havel, the situation in Czechoslovakia seemed to
slip into focus.
   During his one-day trial Tuesday, the short, shy dissident stood
in the courtroom next to the plainclothes police major who arrested
him on Prague's Wenceslas Square.
   In a city where symbols and memories of the past have
extraordinary power, the policeman confronting the writer seemed to
stand for the situation in Czechoslovakia; the officer representing
the authorities, and Havel representing an increasingly dissatisfied
people.
   The authorities showed their strength at the trial, jailing Havel
for nine months and sending a stern message that Czechoslovakia will
not tolerate the kind of changes sweeping through the Soviet bloc.
   But there is an increasing sense that change must come.
   The economy is stagnating, causing shortages that irritate
Czechoslovaks accustomed to a high standard of living.
   Almost 3,000 intellectuals, including some members of the ruling
Communist Party, took the unprecedented step of demanding Havel's
release in petitions to the government.
   Signatories who asked not to be identified said they were
disillusioned with authorities and felt an overwhelming need to
speak out against the violence used to break up protests last month.
They said they also felt, as one put it, that ``Gorbachev is
covering our backs.''
   Elsewhere in the increasingly disparate Soviet bloc, the reforms
of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev have had far more effect.
   In Poland, the government is talking with the Solidarity trade
union movement, which it outlawed in 1982. Hungary's Communist Party
seems ready to allow genuinely independent groups to compete for a
share of power.
   But Czechoslovakia's leadership, still haunted by the specter of
the Soviet-led invasion that crushed reform in 1968, firmly rejects
political change.
   As a Soviet bloc diplomat in Prague recently noted, it is
difficult for men such as Communist Party chief Milos Jakes,
responsible for purging the party of half a million members after
1968, to change course now.
   The leadership also is accustomed to criticism from the West over
human rights abuses. While it would like better relations and trade
with Western countries, it is not prepared to change its policy to
secure them.
   This left the West with little leverage to influence the outcome
of Havel's trial or the case of two other dissidents convicted the
next day.
   ``The only thing that would bite is if the West Germans and the
Austrians stopped their contracts'' for joint trade, said a Western
diplomat last week.
   An article published last week in the Soviet media and summarized
in the party daily Rude Pravo strongly indicated the Soviets are not
happy with Prague's handling of five days of protests in January.
   The protests commemorated the 20th anniversary of a student who
killed himself to protest the 1968 invasion. They followed a series
of demonstrations that started in August, 20 years after the
invasion.
   Active dissenters remain a tiny minority among the 5.5 million
Czechoslovaks, and several dissidents said they were surprised by
the street protests. However, they see little future in continued
demonstrations.
   ``We must look for new means to protest, otherwise they will just
take all of us and grind us down with fines,'' said dissident Petr
Pospichal, referring to new and tougher laws on public order that
impose up to a year in jail or a $2,000 fine.
   Although the leadership has cracked down hard on organized
dissent since January, it has also offered what it calls dialogue
with disaffected intellectuals and representatives of the young
people who made up the bulk of the demonstrators.
   Reformers within the party have formed clubs of ``readers of the
Soviet press'' at which they discuss economic and political changes,
informed sources say.
   But unless the party opens up to bodies such as the Roman
Catholic Church, which has an increasing following among the young,
it is unlikely to win the popular support it needs and which Hungary
and Poland are seeking as they try to redefine Socialism.
   In Czechoslovakia, as Havel noted in his closing trial speech,
traditional labels like Socialist and anti-Socialist also have lost
``any semantic meaning,'' having been applied in just his own
lifetime to three former Communist party leaders, Rudolf Slansky,
Gustav Husak and Alexander Dubcek.
   The sense in Czechoslovakia now is that another watershed is
coming in the nation's politics.
   But the police major and his backers will not share power easily
with Havel or the dissatisfied people. As Dubcek himself noted in an
interview in the current edition of the underground monthly Lidove
Noviny, ``the road to democratization will be a long one.''

``Every time you came you tried to solve major issues.''
   From the airport, Bush rode directly to Tiananmen Square, where
the ancient imperial Forbiddden City sprawls on one side of an
eight-lane highway and the mausoleum of Chairman Mao Tse-tung the
other.
   Bush ordered his stretch Mercedes limousine stopped and he jumped
out to work the crowd.
   ``I know this guy!'' Bush called out, using one of a politician's
favorite salutations in a crowd. ``Good to see you all again!''
   The Chinese clapped, politely. Metal barriers held the citizenry
back. Several thousand bicyclists and pedestrians lined the street
along the motorcade route, but local Americans said many were there
not to see Bush but simply because traffic had been halted.
   It doesn't take much to create a crowd in Beijing, they said. All
you have to do is stop traffic for five minutes.
   Bush's stop, planned in advance, was outside the Gate of Heavenly
Peace and below a massive portrait of Mao Tse-tung. American flags
flew beside Chinese flags in red with five gold stars. Some in the
crowd waved tiny American flags.
   A government interpreter in a leather coat was asked how the
American flag happened to be flying there. ``Ask the American
embassy,'' she replied.
   Someone held aloft a small white sign that read ``Hello.''
   ``How are you?'' said Bush, reaching for hands. ``So nice to see
you.''
   ``It's warm here, warmer than I remember,'' he said.
   A hazy red sun hung low in the afternoon sky.
   Mrs. Bush, in a purple coat, seemed to be enjoying the moment,
too. ``I love China,'' she said on the plane from Tokyo. ``I had
very, very happy years there.''
   The first time they were in China was like seeing ``a black and
white movie,'' she said. ``Last time we were there, three or four
years ago, it was really an emerged nation.''
   Next stop was the Diaoyutai State Guest House, where Premier Li
Peng and tea awaited. Also gifts.
   Li remembered that the Bushes were fond of bicycling around
Beijing when he was head of the U.S. Liaison Office here. So he gave
them two bikes, one in lime green for Bush, a bright red one for
Mrs. Bush.
   ``What a beautiful present,'' Bush said. An aide handed him a
large, gold-wrapped box which Bush gave to Li. ``This is not nearly
as nice,'' the president said apologetically.
   Li handed the box to an aide who unwrapped it. The premier seemed
stunned by his gift, a pair of black cowboy boots. They were
handmade in Houston, with a Chinese flag on the front of one boot
and an American flag on the other boot.
   Ling said maybe he would wear the boots when he visited America.
``It's not a habit in China to have flags on the front,'' he said.
   There was an untold secret about the Bushes' gift of a pair of
Flying Pigeons, made by the Tianjin bicycle factory which turned out
China's first bikes and is a major producer.
   What went unmentioned was that the Xinhua News Agency reported
last Tuesday that Li Qizhu, a top executive of the bicycle factory,
had been charged with taking a $13,500 bribe for illegal shipments
of 11,000 bicycles and with profiteering on the sale of another 600
bikes.

   The first U.S. doctors to work in
Communist Vietnam have operated successfully on 101 children, who
suffered mouth deformities, the official Vietnam News Agency said
Saturday.
   It said former Prime Minister Pham Van Dong received the doctors
from ``Operation Smile'' at the presidential palace in the capital,
Hanoi, on Friday and told them he hopes the two countries increase
cooperation in medical and other fields.
   Seven plastic surgeons and two other physicians corrected cleft
lips and palates of children at the Olof Palme Institute for the
Protection of Children's Health, said the report, monitored in
Bangkok.
   ``Operation Smile'' is a Norfolk, Va.-based agency and one of
various private charitable groups that have responded to a U.S.
government call for more humanitarian aid to Hanoi.
   The aid call was partly in response to Hanoi's help in resolving
cases of U.S. soldiers missing in the Vietnam War. The Pentagon says
2,383 Americans are unaccounted for.
   The United States has not established diplomatic relations with
Vietnam since the communists defeated the U.S.-backed South Vietnam
government in April 1975 and reunified the country. However, in the
last two years, more and more private American citizens have visited
Vietnam.

   Calls came from people as far away as 300
miles and their instructions to Louisiana legislators were clear:
Seat David Duke in the state House.
   It was exactly as the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan had
predicted during his campaign. His anti-tax, anti-affirmative
action, anti-welfare message was out of the bag and his backers were
speaking up all over the state.
   ``My election, my winning it with my controversial background,
has made it OK for other candidates and other public officials to
address the issues that I've addressed,'' Duke said.
   Duke, 38, was elected with a 227-vote margin over homebuilder
John Treen, 63, to represent a 99.6-percent white district in
Metairie, a New Orleans suburb with 21,000 registered voters.
   A much-talked about challenge to seating Duke fizzled when 69 of
102 legislators decided that he should be sworn in Wednesday.
Louisiana's voters had gotten their point across.
   ``My phone rang off the hook. I didn't get a single call opposing
him,'' said state Rep. Ed Scogin, from Slidell, part of metro New
Orleans. ``And they said things like, `If you don't vote to seat
him, we won't vote to seat you in the next election.'''
   ``Everybody who talked to me in my district wanted me to vote to
seat him,'' said state Rep. Carl Gunter, from Pineville, 200 miles
away in central Louisiana.
   ``I had several calls. People told me they hoped we would seat
him. His people voted him in. He was a duly elected official,'' said
state Rep. Francis Thompson of Delhi, about 300 miles away in
northern Louisiana.
   Duke left the Klan in 1980 and formed his own organization, the
National Association for the Advancement of White People, which he
describes as a civil rights group.
   His 1988 run for president, first as a Democrat and then on the
Populist Party ticket, earned him little more than a paragraph or
two in stories on those ``other'' candidates in the presidential
race.
   But his decision to run as a Republican in the House district
primary in January, and his surprise lead among seven candidates,
brought international opposition and uncommon attention to the
candidate.
   And the national GOP feared a Duke victory woulde tarnish its
image, especially among blacks.
   Suddenly, the political process was seasoned just the way
Louisiana likes it _ piquant. The Republicans rushed in endorsements
for Treen from President Bush and former President Reagan. Duke
charged outside interference and said 15- and 20-year-old photos
showing him in Klan robes or a Nazi uniform were ``tomorrow's
crawfish wrap.''
   It was spicy like the old days when politicians claimed
``Louisianians don't want good government, they want pretty good
government.'' Or when a sheriff campaigned for re-election from his
jail cell and won. Or when Gov. Edwin Edwards dared U.S. Attorney
John Volz to convict him of racketeering _ Edwards was acquitted and
Volz suffered a heart attack.
   Jefferson Parish Registrar Sam Altobello said he got calls from
all over the state from people asking if they could come register to
vote in the Feb. 18 runoff election between Duke and Treen.
   Now, armed with a state representative's credibility, Duke is
speaking up.
   ``You're going to find ... a repetition of what I've done all
over the United States. Only it's going to be people more identified
with the mainstream, and that to me signifies a tremendous shift.
   ``I think in terms of civil rights, affirmative action and
minority set-asides, they've gone as far as they can and now you're
going to have people demand civil rights for everyone, white or
black.
   ``I think that's what this election has symbolized. I think
that's why a lot of minority racist groups have opposed it and have
been so alarmed by it all.''

   Stompie Seipei, the 14-year-old
activist allegedly murdered by Winnie Mandela's bodyguards, was
buried Saturday and eulogized as a youth who gave up his childhood
to fight for freedom.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, was not mentioned by name during the funeral service.
   Some anti-apartheid leaders have renounced her since Seipei's
death, but speakers at the funeral urged reconciliation.
   About 500 mourners packed into a Roman Catholic church in
Tumahole, the township where Seipei, at age 10, became commander of
an army of militant boys who agitated against apartheid.
   They sang songs of freedom, raised clenched fists and chanted
their loyalty to the ANC guerrilla movement and to Mandela, the
country's best-known black leader.
   The Rev. Peter Storey, leader of the Methodist Church in the
Johannesburg region, blamed apartheid for Seipei's death.
   ``What have we done in this country, that a child who should have
been chattering in a classroom or playing marbles in his backyard
should have become a 14-year-old general with the tired eyes of an
old man?'' asked Storey, a white.
   The number of mourners swelled to about 1,000 as chanting,
singing youths ran ahead of the hearse to the cemetery where Seipei
was buried.
   Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards, known as the Mandela United soccer
club, in December allegedly abducted Seipei and three young men
staying at a Methodist Church sanctuary in Soweto, the township
outside Johannesburg.
   The victims allegedly were taken to Mrs. Mandela's home and
beaten.
   Police say Seipei's decomposed body was found in a Soweto field
Jan. 7.
   The three others implicated Mandela United members in their
abduction, and two team members and the club's bus driver were
arrested last week in connection with Seipei's slaying.
   Two other murders also have been linked to Mandela United.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied any knowledge of Seipei's death but has
said the youths were taken from the church because they were being
sexually abused by a white minister, the Rev. Paul Verryn. Methodist
officials have said the allegations are false, and Verryn attended
Saturday's funeral.
   Speakers at the service indicated Seipei's killers may have
thought incorrectly that he was a police informer.
   During the 32-month-old state of emergency imposed by the South
African government to quell unrest in black townships, police often
have restricted the size and duration of funerals for slain
activists.
   No restrictions were imposed on Seipei's funeral, however, and
speakers suggested that authorities were trying to exploit his death
to deepen divisions in the black community.
   ``We shouldn't point fingers at other people, because Stompie was
interested in unity,'' said McLean Skosane, a local anti-apartheid
leader. ``Don't let his death divide us.''
   Leading anti-apartheid groups have accused Mandela United of
terrorizing Soweto residents and for months asked Mrs. Mandela to
disband the group, which lived at her home. She refused the request
until last week.
   Police searched her home Monday and said they found blood on
walls and weapons including clubs and a knife.
   She has called the actions by police and anti-apartheid activists
a plot to discredit her.
   Seipei became an anti-apartheid leader at age 10, when he and a
friend formed the ``Under Fourteens'' in Tumahole, about 60 miles
southwest of Johannesburg.
   More than 1,000 youths served under Seipei and challenged police
and pro-government vigilantes during the height of township unrest
in 1985-86.
   ``The other groups were all talk and no action,'' the youth told
a British journalist in 1987.
   Seipei was detained for the first time when he was 11 and became
the youngest person held under emergency regulations. He learned to
play chess in detention and tried to keep up with studies that were
interrupted when he left primary school in 1986.
   In 1987, he addressed an anti-apartheid meeting at Johannesburg's
University of the Witwatersrand, enthralling his audience and
earning a luncheon invitation from the university's vice chancellor.

   Veteran country and gospel
singer-composer Stuart Hamblen, suffering from a brain tumor, was in
good spirits after receiving get-well calls from former President
Reagan and others.
   Those calling to wish the 82-year-old musician well included
Reagan and such well-known singing movie cowboys as Gene Autry and
Roy Rogers, said Armen Markarian, spokeswoman for St. John's
Hospital and Medical Center.
   Hamblen entered the hospital two weeks ago complaining of
headaches, and the brain tumor was discovered following a battery of
tests, said the musician's spokesman, Garth Hintz.
   Doctors weren't expected to decide whether to operate until later
this week, Markarian said. Hamblen was listed in fair condition
Saturday.
   He is known for such songs as ``Remember Me, I'm the One Who
Loves You,'' ``It Is No Secret What God Can Do,'' Texas Plains'' and
``This Ole House.''

   Former U.S. Rep. Richard A. Tonry, the first
congressman ever to go to prison for violating federal campaign
finance laws, has filed for bankruptcy.
   Tonry, who resigned from Congress six months after his 1976
election and was indicted less than two weeks later, refused to talk
about the Chapter 7 proceedings filed Thursday to liquidate his
assets.
   Bankruptcy court records show that he went to bankruptcy court
after creditors seized some of his property in the wake of a series
of court judgments against him and others.
   The records showed that Tonry, who was defeated in a state House
race in 1983, claimed net income of $78,000 in 1987 and $70,000 in
1988.
   The bankruptcy court filing apparently is the second for Tonry,
who filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition in October 1980 in
connection with business losses of two family owned companies
dissolved earlier that year.
   That petition listed debts of $4.6 million and assets of $2.6
million, but more than $2 million of the assets was money Tonry was
seeking in lawsuits.
   The debts included $1.2 million in legal fees, including $700,000
from the 1976 election charges. Tonry said in 1980 that he had not
been an officer of either company that went under, but had signed
business loan guarantees for his father and brother.

   The Rev. Al Sharpton was sent to jail
Saturday to serve a two-week sentence for obstructing traffic during
an April 4 demonstration in support of a black teen-ager who claims
she was assaulted by several white men.
   Sharpton joined folk singer Pete Seeger, who was jailed Friday on
similar charges in the same demonstration on behalf of Tawana
Brawley.
   ``We weren't going to leave Pete up here by himself,'' Sharpton
said after arriving at the Albany County Jail.
   Sharpton and seven others were taken to jail following an
arraignment at the Albany Police Court before judge Thomas Keegan.
He will serve the last 14 days of a 15-day sentence.
   U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall rejected the request
of Sharpton, Seeger and the others for a stay of their sentences.
   Miss Brawley, a black teen-ager formerly of Wappingers Falls,
claimed she'd been sexually assaulted by a group of white men in
November 1987. A state grand jury concluded she invented the story.

   Salman Rushdie, whose novel ``The Satanic Verses''
prompted Iranian religious leaders to demand his death for allegedly
blaspheming Islam, was born a Moslem in Bombay, India, on June 19,
1947.
   Tall and slender, his black hair thinning above a bespectacled,
fine-featured face, he seems to wear a permanently serious
expression.
   His late father was a wealthy businessman who sent him at age 13
to the prestigious Rugby school in England. Rushdie won a
scholarship to Cambridge University, studying history and developing
an interest in the life of Islam's founder, the Prophet Mohammed.
   From Cambridge he joined his parents in Moslem Pakistan, working
in the country's fledgling TV service. He said the political and
religious prejudice he encountered made him return to England.
   He eked out a living writing advertising copy and two TV films.
His first novel, ``Grimus'' in 1975, drew no critical attention.
   His second, ``Midnight's Children'' in 1981, a tale of those born
at the moment of India's independence in 1947, made his name and won
the Booker Prize and the coveted James Tait Black Memorial Prize.
   ``Shame,'' his third novel, in 1983, treated Pakistan's politics
as myth and was not popular, although it won a prize in France. Then
followed a Nicaragua travel book, ``The Jaguar Smile,'' in 1987 and,
last September, ``The Satanic Verses,'' which won the Whitbread
Prize for a new novel.
   Rushdie has a son from his first marriage in 1976 to Clarissa
Luard. In hiding from the death threats, reportedly with an armed
police guard, he is with his second wife, American novelist Marianne
Wiggins.
   Philip Howard, literary editor of The Times of London, described
Rushdie as the ``stormy petrel, wayward genius, of our younger
novelists; very clever, over-the-top and self-indulgent in his
poetic prose, egotistical, prickly and political, very keen on money
for a professed socialist: one of nature's outsiders.''
   Peregrine Worsthorne, editor of London's conservative Sunday
Telegraph, said it was ``ironic that someone who was only recently
inveighing against Mrs. (Prime Minister Margaret) Thatcher for
having created a police state should now be compelled to rely on
that same police state to save his life.''
   The left-wing New Statesman magazine described Rushdie as ``an
ungratefully rich author who not only believes that writers and
politicians are natural rivals, but acts on that uncomfortable
belief, both in his writings and personal life.''

   Mahound is a businessman who decides to start a new religion in
the city of Jahilia. Only problem, Jahilia already has 360 gods and
doesn't need another.
   But the head of the ruling council proproses a deal: If Mahound's
Allah (the Islamic god) will accept three of the local gods _ Lat,
Uzza and Manat _ as archangels in his sect, he can have his religion
and also a seat on the council. He takes the deal.
   Mahound appears in a dream sequence in the Salman Rushdie book,
``The Satanic Verses.'' He represents Mohammed, revered by Moslems
as the prophet who set down Allah's revelations in the Koran,
Islam's holy book. And the novel's portrayal of Mahound-Mohammed _
as a womanizer, a moral coward willing to compromise his faith for
general acceptance, a conniving businessman who makes up laws to
suit his own purposes _ has inflamed the Islamic world.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' is a dizzying 547-page journey through
countless plots, sub-plots, satire and philosophical questions.
   Lyrical, scathing, inquisitive and, at times, bewildering, the
novel's subjects include society's preconceptions of good and evil,
the British treatment of illegal aliens, the desire by Indians to
become assimilated in British culture and, most notably, the birth
of the Islamic faith.
   Rushdie, a 41-year-old native of Bombay, India, who now lives in
London, writes in a stream-of-consciousness style that leaves the
reader alternately exhilirated, bewildered and _ depending on one's
religious and political orientation _ outraged.
   The book opens with the bombing of a jumbo jet by terrorists. Two
of the passengers _ Gibreel Farishta, an Indian actor who
specializes in religious roles, and Saladin Chamcha, a radio star _
manage to survive by literally falling from the sky. Once they land,
Gibreel assumes an ``angelic glow'' and Saladin grows horns and
hooves.
   The book's second, fourth, and sixth chapters, ``Mahound,''
``Ayesha'' and ``Return to Jahilia,'' contain the most controversial
elements involving Gibreel's dream sequence.
   During the dream, Mahound has a revelation in Gibreel's presence
telling him to accept the deal. But he soon learns that the
supposedly divine message did not come from Gibreel (the archangel)
but from the Devil, who had been impersonating him.
   Mahound renounces the satanic ``verses.'' He and his followers
settle in the ``friendly oasis'' of Yathrib, just as Mohammed
journeyed from Mecca to Medina. There Mahound dictates to a Persian
scribe named Salman the rules of the new religion as prescribed by
Gibreel. But Salman doubts these ``revelations'' because God sounds
too much like a businessman.
   Convinced that Mahound is making up the rules himself, Salman
decides to test his leader by deliberately changing what is recited
to him:
   ``Here's the point: Mahound did not notice the alterations. So
there I was, actually writing the Book, or rewriting, anyway,
polluting the word of God with my own profane language. But, good
heavens, if my poor words could not be distinguished from the
Revelation by God's own Messenger, then what did that mean? What did
that say about the quality of the divine poetry? Look, I swear, I
was shaken to my soul.''

   The nation's biggest booksellers, stiffening
their spines in the face of terrorist threats, have reversed
themselves and declared they will display and sell ``The Satanic
Verses'' after all.
   With their statements, B. Dalton, Barnes &amp; Noble and Waldenbooks
sought to quell a furious protest over their initial moves to pull
the book from their shelves when Iran threatened death to its author
and handlers.
   But it took a statement from President Bush and pleas from their
own employees for the chains to budge. In the end, their
discomfiture made for an awkward and painful drama in which the
shadow of terrorism fell over an unlikely setting, the local
bookstore.
   ``The decision all along has been one of safety. Whether or not
to stand on the front lines against terrorism was not a decision
Waldenbooks wanted to make on behalf of its 8,500 employees,'' said
spokesman Trace Urdan.
   Critics said more than safety was at stake. After initial
hesitation, writers held rallies and readings to support author
Salman Rushdie and to denounce the bookstore chains for abandoning
the freedom of expression.
   ``Rushdie the individual yields place to Rushdie the symbol of
our freedom to write and to publish what we want,'' said author
Diana Trilling.
   Author Norman Mailer spoke of the precedent: ``In this week of
turmoil, we can now envision a fearful time in the future when
fundamentalist groups in America, stealing their page from this
international episode, will know how to apply the same methods to
American writers and bookstores.''
   One result of the controversy _ probably unintended by Iran,
which said ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes against Islam _ has
been heightened demand for the book. Already a best seller on some
regional newspaper lists, it will be No. 2 on The New York Times
list of March 2.
   ``Certainly, the prominent news attention the book has received
has created a great demand for it,'' said a spokesman for Viking
Penguin, the novel's U.S. publisher. ``We are trying to meet that
demand.''
   While the three bookstore chains account for an estimated 25
percent of U.S. book sales, their gyrations meant little practically
because the book's first U.S. printing of 50,000 copies already was
largely sold out. With tens of thousands on order, a second printing
of 15,000 has begun to reach bookstores and a third printing, of
more than 50,000, was begun.
   B. Dalton and its affiliated Barnes &amp; Noble said it decided to
stock the book at the urging of its employees and in light of a
statement by President Bush, who denounced Iran's threats.
Waldenbooks said it decided to allow its managers to display the
book, at their discretion, when many asked to do so.
   Waldenbooks noted that it has received about 60 bomb threats, and
complained in a national newspaper advertisement that its employees
had suffered ``unfair castigation'' for the initial decision to pull
the book.
   ``We do not feel that this is a censorship issue,'' said Urdan,
the Waldenbooks spokesman. ``But obviously there are many who
disagree.''

<DATELINE>ALONG THE JALALABAD HIGHWAY, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the pot-holed
road winds out of the Afghan capital, a tattered poster, its colors
fading, declares ``Kabul is a city of peace.''
   This 100-mile road leads from the Afghan capital east toward
Jalalabad and then onto Pakistan across the Khyber Pass.
   Gunfire erupts sporatically in the suburbs. As travelers ride
through some of the country's most spectacular mountain scenery,
they watch nervously in fear of a rocket attack by Moslem guerrillas
who have infiltrated the area.
   The Afghan government refuses to say to what extent the
guerrillas have penetrated, but it insists the strategic road is
open.
   Scenes along the route suggest otherwise.
   The road is deserted, except a few women drawing water from
nearby wells and men watching Soviet-made trucks hauling supplies to
what would become the muddy front-line of Kabul's defense if
Jalalabad fell to the guerrillas fighting Afghanistan's communist
government.
   The only other travelers who regularly dare this gauntlet are
Pashtun-speaking tribesmen taking their scrawny camels to meat
markets in Kabul.
   In the distance, Afghanistan's war machines are visible.
   Dozens of Soviet tanks left behind for the Afghan army after the
Kremlin's soldiers withdrew are parked on the snow-covered
mountains, easy guerrilla targets.
   At Tangiye Pol-i-Charki, south of the country's most notorious
prison, nervous Afghan soldiers wait at a checkpoint, their rifles
cocked and tin helmets squashed over their Russian-made fur hats.
   The checkpoint's proximity, about 20 miles south of Kabul, is an
indication of the precarious hold the army has had over the highway
since the first Soviet armored columns started leaving Afghanistan
on May 15.
   ``I'm sorry, you can't go any further without special permission
from the Interior Ministry,'' said one soldier as he opened the car
trunk and glove compartment, searching for weapons. ``There is much
fighting out there.''
   The soldier, who would not give his name, said he and six
comrades had been recruited recently in preparation for a final
showdown between the guerrillas and the Afghan armed forces
following the departure of Soviet troops Feb. 15.
   Watching them closely were two stern-looking members of KHAD, the
Soviet-style secret police assigned the task of maintaining loyalty
among the army.
   The soldier, speaking through a government-sponsored interpreter,
refused to talk about the fighting.
   But he said a convoy carrying fruit, vegetables and firewood from
Pakistan had been delayed because some trucks had run out of fuel.
   Kabul has been plagued by shortages of fuel and heating oil, and
the situation has forced some families to burn tree branches to try
to heat their mud-and-brick homes when the temperature drops to 5
degrees.
   Aside from the convoys, the only other travelers were the camel
trains.
   Tribesmen bring their camels from Pakistan, a journey that takes
at least seven days, to markets in Kabul. But the sparse supply
sells for as much as $10 a pound, too expensive for most Afghans.
   The tribesmen said most of the trip is done at night because of
threats by the guerrillas, called mujahedeen, or Islamic holy
warriors.
   ``The mujahedeen don't want us to bring our camels to Kabul,''
said Ghulam, a camel dealer. ``They say we're helping the government
and they will shoot us if we don't stop.''
   He said the guerrillas have never carried out their threat. Some
diplomats and observers believe some tribesmen have secretly agreed
to carry weapons and ammunition in a deal that allows them to travel
through the guerrilla-dominated countryside.
   Ghulam insisted he and his friends have never carried arms for
the guerrillas. He said they never would.
   ``We don't like them,'' he said. ``And we're not going to stop.
This is our way of life.''

   Here are some of the recent incidents involving
airliner aging and metal fatigue prior to damage that killed nine
people Friday when an 18-year-old United Air Lines 747 tore open
over the Pacific. Cause of the incident had not been determined:
   January 20, 1989 _ A Piedmont Airlines 737's dropped an engine
shortly after takeoff from Chicago. None of 3 passengers and crew
was injured and the plane landed safely. The aircraft was only seven
years old, but authorities blamed metal fatigue and a cracked bolt.
   December 26, 1988 _ An late 1960s Eastern Airlines Boeing 727
with 104 passengers and six crew aboard was forced to land at Yeager
Airport in Charleston, W.Va., after a 14-inch hole opened in its
fuselage at 31,000 feet. There were no injuries. The incident led to
fleetwide inspection and discovery of a 3-inch crack in another old
Eastern 727.
   Sept. 21, 1988 _ An American Airlines 727 made a belly landing at
Dallas-Fort Worth after metal fatigue in its landing gear prevented
the pilot from opening the wheel well door. The 88 passengers and
crew evacuated with three people injured. Boeing had recommended
inspections eight days earlier after finding metal fatigue in the
same area in other 727s.
   May 9, 1988 _ A 20-year-old American Airlines 727 was forced to
make an unscheduled landing at Detroit after a 15-inch crack in a
wheel well caused a drop in cabin pressure. None of the 112 aboard
was injured.
   April 28, 1988 _ A flight attendant was killed and 61 persons
injured when a portion of the fuselage on a heavily flown Aloha
Airlines 737 built in the late 1960s peeled off at 24,000 feet
during an Aloha flight from Hilo to Honolulu. Tiny cracks were found
later in nearly half the aging Boeing 737 jetliners inspected in the
months following and the FAA ordered the reriveting of hundreds of
older 737s.
   Dec. 5, 1987 _ An engine fell of a USAir 737 in Philadelphia,
causing no injuries. The FAA ordered inspection of engine-mount
bolts on some 737s.

   Here is a chronology of the controversy over ``The Satanic
Verses.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>1988</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Sept. 22 _ ``The Satanic Verses,'' a 547-page satirical fantasy
that parodies some elements of Moslem faith, is published by Viking
Penguin Inc. in England. It is the sixth book for Salman Rushdie,
41, a Bombay-born British citizen who has given up his Moslem faith.
The novel wins him the Whitbread Novel Award and critical acclaim.
   Oct. 5 _ Rushdie's native India bans the book as blasphemous,
barring its import and sale, and fears militant Moslems may use it
to incite riots. Rushdie protests the ban, which later spreads to
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and other Moslem
countries.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>1989</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Jan. 14 _ About 1,500 Moslems in Bradford, England, burn a copy
of the book and protest its content. W.H. Smith and Sons Ltd. pulls
the book from its London stores despite the protests of Rushdie and
other writers.
   Feb. 4 _ 3,000 Moslems march against the book in Birmingham,
England.
   Feb. 12 _ Six people die and 83 are injured as police fire
semi-automatic weapons at 3,000 fundamentalists who storm the U.S.
Information Center in Islamabad, Pakistan, demanding the book be
banned in the United States. Sixty-five people are arrested. They
burn the American flag and chant, ``Hang Rushdie!''
   Feb. 13 _ Police fire into a stone-throwing crowd protesting the
book in Srinagar, India, killing one person and wounding more than
60. The mob forces shops and businesses to close. Moslem students
also march in several Pakistani cities.
   Feb. 14 _ Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decrees a ``death
sentence'' for Rushdie. ``Whoever is killed doing this (killing
Rushdie) will be regarded as a martyr and will go directly to
heaven,'' Khomeini tells would-be assassins. Rushdie says, ``I wish
I had written a more critical book.'' Scotland Yard gives him police
protection.
   Feb. 15 _ Rushdie's 11-city U.S. tour, coinciding with the U.S.
publication of the book, is canceled after an Iranian cleric puts a
$2.6 million price on his head. The bounty is later doubled. Rushdie
goes into hiding with his wife.
   Feb. 16 _ Waldenbooks, the nation's largest bookseller, orders
the $19.95 book off its shelves out of fear that threats of violence
might extend to its employees. It sells the book on request. The B.
Dalton and Barnes &amp; Noble chains, which have more than 1,250 stores,
later pull the book from their shelves.
   Feb. 18 _ Rushdie says he regrets ``the distress that publication
has occasioned,'' but the Iranian news agency says the apology isn't
enough to rescind the death sentence. Khomeini tells Moslems: ``Send
him to hell.''
   Feb. 20 _ The 12 members of the European Common Market countries
recall their ambassadors to Iran. Britain, which reopened its
embassy in Iran in November after a 17-month break, says it will
close its operation again in Tehran.
   Feb. 21 _ Iran retaliates by recalling all its ambassadors to the
Common Market countries. President Bush says the call for Rushdie's
execution is ``deeply offensive.''
   Feb. 22 _ Hundreds of authors march outside the Iranian Mission
to the United Nations as outraged writers step up their protests
over the reaction to the book. ``You will have to kill us all,''
says Boston author James Carroll in a remark aimed at Khomeini. B.
Dalton and Barnes &amp; Noble reverse their decision to pull the book.
   Feb. 24 _ In Bombay, India, street protests against the novel
left at least nine people dead and 40 injured. Initial news reports
said up to 12 died in protests over the book, but a police
commissioner, S.M. Shangari, said eight people died in the rioting
and one man died later in the hospital. Peaceful protest also were
reported in New Delhi, Calcutta and several other Indian cities.
   Feb. 25 _ British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe today said
Austria, Finland ``and a number of other countries'' he didn't
identify have agreed to join the 12 Common Market nations in
withdrawing their ambassadors from Iran to protest Tehran's death
threat against Rushdie.

<HEAD>Boeing Having Tough Time, But Overall Still Is Strong, Industry Experts
Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Plane Emergency, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Despite recent crashes and two accidents in which
big sections of fuselage have ripped away from airplanes, the Boeing
Co. still gets high marks from airline officials, industry analysts
and safety advocates.
   That Boeing planes have suffered highly publicized problems
lately is a combination of bad luck, the fact that an estimated 65
percent of all commercial airplanes were made by Boeing, and the
fact that planes are just now getting old enough to fail, they say.
   It's a ``pure set of coincidences that we're having this rash of
happenings at this point,'' said Paul Nisbet, aerospace analyst with
Prudential Bache in New York. ``I don't think that the market is
paying an awful lot of attention to these events, because they have
not been tied to any wrongdoing or fault of Boeing.
   ``They have been older airplanes, in many cases, where the
maintenance hasn't been as thorough as perhaps it should have been.''
   Friday's emergency in Hawaii, in which an 18-year-old Boeing 747
lost a large panel from the right side, and nine people were blown
out to their deaths, was the latest in a series of problems that
have dragged Boeing's name across newspaper front pages _ a sharp
contrast to the usual reports about multibillion-dollar orders for
new planes.
   Nearly a year ago, a 737 lost so much of its fuselage near Hawaii
that it resembled a convertible. A stewardess died in that accident.
In December, a 727 was forced to land at Charleston, W.Va., after a
14-inch hole opened in the fuselage at 31,000 feet.
   The first accident led to concern about the safety of aging jets.
Tiny cracks were found in nearly half the older Boeing 737s
inspected in the succeeding months.
   ``A lot of us put the aging aircraft and the structures problem
as the most significant in the whole area of aviation safety,'' said
John Galipault, president of the Aviation Safety Institute, a
non-profit, independent, aviation accident prevention research group
in Worthington, Ohio.
   ``We put it above security matters, air traffic control matters,
pilot training and human factors,'' Galipault said. ``I don't think
that Boeing has or should be accused of any malfeasance in this
regard at all.
   ``By and large, we have always found that Boeing has maintained a
high level of integrity.''
   Boeing this month said it had hired a public-relations firm, Hill
and Knowlton Inc. One sign of its influence was a Boeing statement
expressing condolences over the Feb. 8 crash of a chartered 707 in
the Azores _ the first time Boeing has issued such a statement
before the cause of a crash was officially determined.
   In addition to the fuselage blowouts and crashes, the world's
biggest maker of commercial jetliners also has had problems with
miswired emergency systems in some newer planes, a possibility that
arose after a 737 crash in England in January, and production delays
on its 747-400.
   ``What you have here is a series of events, and the only
correlation is that they're happening in the same time frame, but if
you dissect each one you will find that they're totally unrelated,''
said David Jimenez of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, a subsidiary that
has prided itself on high-quality work and a strong safety record in
its planes.
   With news reports of problems in rapid succession, however, ``it
does become one large blur to the public,'' Jimenez conceded.
   ``It's made for a very intense period of being scrutinized,
sometimes unfairly, and that's a difficult thing to counter because
the incidents are happening ... and we don't always have time to
explain ourselves,'' he said.
   ``You take each one as they come and you try to anticipate what
the press is going to focus on next,'' Jimenez said. ``We're
sustaining. I think we're doing pretty good in terms of the
attention we're getting.''
   Some analysts predicted recent accidents and problems won't
slacken airplane orders, and may even have the opposite effect as
airlines step up replacement of aging aircraft.
   Boeing, in fact, received record orders last year _ for 636
planes valued at a total of more than $30 billion.

<HEAD>Two Polls Predict Kohl's Party Would Lose Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
center-right coalition would lose its governing majority if national
elections were held now, according to two separate polls published
Saturday.
   In both polls, Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats and their
Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, lagged behind
opposition Social Democrats.
   One poll gave the Social Democrats and leftist Greens enough
votes to form a governing coalition.
   A poll released by the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel said
Kohl's party would receive 38 percent of votes if national elections
were held Sunday.
   Elections are scheduled for December 1990.
   According to Der Spiegel, the Social Democrats would get 41
percent and the Greens 8 percent. The Free Democrats, Kohl's junior
coalition partner, came out with 9 percent.
   The Emnid Institute conducted the survey for the magazine,
polling 2,000 voters over 16 days ending Feb. 18. The magazine did
not give the margin of error.
   A poll released in advance Saturday by Bild am Sontag Sunday
newspaper gave the Christian Democrats 35.5 percent, the Social
Democrats 39.3 percent, the Free Democrats 8.4 and the Greens 11.1
percent.
   That poll, which also ended Feb. 18, was conducted by the
Allensbach Institute and involved 1,000 voters questioned over 14
days, the newspaper said. It gave no margin of error.
   Kohl's party has been slipping in polls for months. Institute
director Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann told the Sunday newspaper that
Kohl's coalition lacked unity and had not explained well enough the
need for unpopular reforms that make health care more expensive.
   Der Spiegel's poll gave the far-right Republicans 3 percent,
while the Bild am Sontag survey predicted they would get 4.7 percent.
   The Republicans garnered 7.5 percent of votes in Jan. 29
elections that won them their first seats in West Berlin's local
legislature. Under West Germany's election laws, the Republicans
will automatically send two deputies to the federal parliament after
the 1990 elections.
   Kohl's party lost its governing majority in West Berlin and the
Social Democrats are holding talks with the leftist Alternative
List, similar to the Greens, on a coalition city government.
   Kohl on Saturday warned the Social Democrats against a coalition
with what he called a ``radical group that stands in a
leftist-socialist and anarchist gray zone.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Publishes Report on 1981 Mine Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official newspaper on Saturday published
a rare account of the police shooting of nine miners, the bloodiest
confrontation during a 1981 crackdown that suppressed the Solidarity
trade movement.
   The killings near the southern city of Katowice have become a
symbol of the brutality of the effort to suppress the Soviet bloc's
only independent trade movement.
   ``In order that wounds could cure completely, it is necessary to
expose them so that we could know all the truth about how they
originated and how they were cured,'' said the article in the weekly
Odrodzenie (Rebirth).
   The Dec. 16, 1981 battle began when miners went on strike to
protest authorities' attempt to quash Solidarity in a martial law
decree.
   The article quotes witnesses who described how police entered the
Wujek mine in a tank and armored personnel carriers and attacked the
miners with tear gas, water cannons and grenades.
   ``We saw the tank enter the mine's ground, breaking the barricade
we had erected from pipes and transport wagons, and under its cover
a wave of blue uniforms poured into the yard,'' the article quoted
Kazimierz Rembilas, a former mine employee, as saying.
   ``Then shots were fired. In the noise and chaos one could not see
who was shooting and from which direction.
   ``There was a moment of shock. I heard cries: `They are killed.'
Even then I could not believe they were shooting at us,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   The article interviewed Roza Czekalska, whose husband was one of
the miners killed.
   ``He (her husband) never got involved in politics. But he was
always going together with others in Solidarity. I still can't
understand how they could shoot at Polish miners,'' she was quoted
as saying.
   The weekly said two social commIttees in Katowice are seeking
permission to erect a monument to the victims of the Wujek mine.
   Until now, the Wujek mine incident has been virtually taboo for
the official media and an embarrassment for authorities who have
justified the military crackdown by saying it was necessary to avoid
some greater unspecified tragedy.
   Odrodzenie is one of many official newspapers now exploring
sensitive issues in Polish history.
   Last week, it published a Polish Red Cross report on the massacre
of more than 4,000 PolIsh officers in the Katyn forest during World
II. The Red Cross report implicitly pinned responsibility on the
Soviet Union.
   Polish and Soviet history books have long maintained Hitler's
army was responsible for the murder of the officers.

   Here are some average ages of airline fleets
from data compiled in January by Avmark Inc., an appraisal and
consulting company that keeps track of the world's airliners.
   The figures are based on the age of the fleets as of July 1,
1988. Aviation experts say that more than chronological age, the
safety and value of an airliner is determined by the quality of
maintenance and the number of flying cycles, or takeoffs and
landings, and other factors in its individual history.
   The average age of all U.S. jetliners with major carriers is
12.67 years and the average age of the worldwide fleet of more than
8,800 airliners is 13.1 years.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Arrives In Tehran For Talks With Khomeini</HEAD>

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze arrived in Tehran on Saturday for a rare audience with
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that promises a thaw in long-strained
relations between the neighbors.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Shevardnadze, the
highest ranking Soviet official to visit Iran since the 1979 Islamic
revolution, carried a message for Khomeini from Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, gave no hint about
the letter's contents.
   Shevardnadze is on the final leg of a 10-day mission aimed at
boosting Moscow's influence in the Middle East.
   Shevardnadze has refused to say whether he will discuss with
Khomeini the Iranian leader's death sentence on British novelist
Salman Rushdie for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his book ``The
Satanic Verses.''
   West European countries have recalled their senior diplomats from
Tehran in protest of the threat. Sources in London said Friday that
Britain had asked Shevardnadze to press Iran to renounce its death
threat.
   Moscow was the main arms supplier to Iraq, Iran's enemy in the
8-year gulf war, and it withdrew thousands of technicians from
Tehran when the fighting began.
   IRNA did not say when Shevardnadze will meet Iran's revolutionary
88-year-old patriarch, who seldom meets with foreign dignitaries.
   Khomeini sent Gorbachev an unprecedented personal message last
month, praising his reforms and urging him to pay more attention to
the Soviets' spiritual needs.
   Officials in both countries called the message a ``turning
point'' in relations which also have been improved by the Soviet
military withdrawal from neighboring Afghanistan and greater
religious freedoms granted the 50 million Moslems in the Soviet
Union.
   Tehran's English-language daily, Kayhan International, said
Shevardnadze's three-day visit to Tehran heralds closer ties.
   ``There is wide scope for Iran and the Soviet Union to cooperate
on the regional and international scene,'' it said.
   IRNA reported Shevardnadze was greeted at Tehran's Mehrabad
airport by Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and other senior
officials.
   The Soviet official flew to Iran from Baghdad, capital of Iraq.
   Before leaving, he called for the withdrawal of foreign navies
from the Persian Gulf and said Moscow is ready to pull out its
warships to help revive deadlocked Iran-Iraq peace talks that began
after a cease-fire took effect Aug. 20.
   His remarks at a news conference appeared pointed at the United
States, which has the largest fleet of warships in the waterway _ 23.
   Iran repeatedly has demanded a foreign naval withdrawal from the
gulf, which carries one-fifth of the non-communist world's oil
supplies.
   Apart from the U.S. fleet, the only other Western ships in the
gulf are some minesweepers belonging to Britain and France. Britain
plans to withdraw its vessels in the next week or two.
   Shevardnadze refused to say what he would discuss with Khomeini.
   ``It is natural that we cannot avoid urgent and important
issues,'' he said in clear reference to the stalled peace talks.

<HEAD>Government Official Confident Taba Will Be Settled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Foreign Ministry official said Saturday the
Egyptian-Israeli border dispute over the Red Sea resort of Taba is
likely to be settled this week, ending a quarrel that has marred
bilateral relations for seven years.
   Under a tentative agreement, Israel would return Taba to Egypt,
but Israelis would be allowed to visit the 250-acre resort without
visas or special entry fees.
   The package still needs final approval of the Israeli Cabinet,
which is due to vote on it Sunday. Egyptian and Israeli delegates
will meet in Taba to work out the final details of the package.
   ``If it goes quickly, we will be able to sign Sunday night,''
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel.
   Once the agreement is signed, Israel will withdraw from Taba
within two weeks.
   Taba also is the site of a luxury hotel and a holiday village,
but negotiations over the future of the two facilities are being
conducted separately between the owners and the Egyptian Tourism
Ministry.
   Previous reports said the hotel owner was to receive $40 million
from Egypt for the property, but Liel said no final agreement has
been reached.
   He added, however, that even if the private negotiations were
delayed, the main agreement on sovereignty and Israeli access could
be signed.
   Israel retained Taba after returning the rest of the Sinai
Peninsula to Egypt in 1982. The issue went to arbitration, and an
international panel last year determined a final border marker that
puts Taba in Egyptian territory.
   The dispute has marred bilateral relations, and tensions rose
during the negotiations following arbitration. Earlier this month,
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Israel was jeopardizing
relations by its ``repulsive'' equivocation over withdrawal from the
beachfront territory.

<DATELINE>YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Prince Philip laid a wreath at a
war cemetery Saturday in a move to honor memories and appease
veterans angered that he paid last respects to Emperor Hirohito,
Japan's World War II leader.
   Philip, accompanied by Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe, honored
the 1,738 British, Australian and other war dead buried at the
Yokohama Commonwealth War Cemetery a day after attending Hirohito's
elaborate funeral.
   In light rain, the two British representatives laid wreaths at
the center of the rolling cemetery grounds and later spoke with
members of the local British community.
   British war veterans and lawmakers decried the attendance of
Queen Elizabeth II's husband at the funeral of the late monarch,
whom they denounced as a war criminal.
   In London, Queen Elizabeth II on Saturday appealed to one World
War II veteran to end his hunger strike, which was begun in protest
of Philip's attendance.
   There was no immediate reaction to the latest appeal from
70-year-old Andrew Burgess, who has been eating nothing and drinking
only black tea for the last nine days.
   Fighting under Hirohito's name, Japanese forces killed about
27,000 British soldiers and 20,000 Dutch troops. Many survivors also
held Hirohito accountable for atrocities committed against 127,000
Dutch people interned during the war.
   ``We are accustomed to hearing such kinds of criticism,'' said
Seizaburo Sato, a professor of political science at Tokyo
University. ``Japan made a mistake.''
   ``But didn't (the) British or Dutch do really bad things to
Asians they colonized, for example, India or Indonesia? If they
think about what they have done for a much longer period of time
than Japan did, I think they should be more modest.''
   Most historians maintain that the late emperor was merely a
glorified figurehead with little political power. Hirohito died on
Jan. 7 at age 87, never having made clear his role in the war.
   The cemetery is on the site of a playground that Hirohito opened
more than 65 years ago when he was crown prince.
   Nestled in the hills of Yokohama, south of Tokyo, the cemetery
also holds the remains of soldiers from Canada, India, New Zealand
and other Commonwealth nations, and the ashes of an undetermined
number of U.S. soldiers. Many died while being held as prisoners of
war or aboard POW ships on the way to Japan in 1942 following the
surrender of Singapore.
   At least one British war veteran attending the wreath-laying
ceremony thought Philip's visit to Japan was justified. The quick
trip to Yokohama was largely seen as an attempt to appease anger
over his attendance at the funeral.
   ``People are entitled to their own opinions,'' said Edward Ward,
77, who said he had served in Britain's intelligence corps and has
lived in Japan for about 10 years.
   ``But human rights would be in a sad state if people held grudges
forever more.''

<HEAD>Health Authorities Recommend Sex To Alleviate Stress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATTI HUUHTANEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adults who want to alleviate the stress
of everday life should have sex more often and even consider taking
``sex holidays,'' according to a draft report prepared by a
government-appointed committee.
   The committee concluded that Finns should concentrate more on the
joys of sex and the sense of well-being it brings and less on
negative things such as lewdness and sexually-transmitted diseases,
a member said.
   The panel's work was described in a story published last week by
the country's largest newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat. It published
notes for a draft memo the committee sent to the Ministry of Health
and Social Affairs.
   The memo recommends that people be ``given the possibility of
having sex holidays during which they can forget pressing matters
and concentrate on relaxing in erotic pleasure and satisfaction.''
   The notes were written by a member of the Eroticism and the
Promotion of Health Committee, appointed by the ministry a year ago
to study health and sex in Finnish society.
   ``They were not meant to be published at this stage, but what we
want to point out is that a more open discussion of sexual matters
is sorely needed,'' Tyyne Martikainen, an official at the ministry,
said in an interview Friday.
   ``In Finland we have made a lot of progress in sexual matters
during the past few decades, but we need to broaden the
discussion,'' she said.
   Sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and syphilis are
decreasing in Finland, and the number of abortions has dropped by 50
percent since the 1970s, mainly due to government-sponsored
information programs.
   The spread of AIDS also seems to have slowed in Finland. The
latest figures show 243 known HIV carriers and 41 AIDS cases, only a
slight increase over the same period last year.
   Pauliina Aarva, a member of committee, said the education
campaigns have worked well, but she wants more discussion of the
positive aspects of sex.
   ``What we have to do is to be able to talk about sex in a
positive manner. It seems that whenever the subject is brought up it
is either in association with such negative elements as AIDS,
diseases, abortions or as something lewd and dirty,'' she said.
   Despite the wording of the draft, Ms. Aarva played down the idea
of sex holidays. ``When our final report is published in April, it
will simply be a working paper intended for discussion, not even as
a recommendation for a government health program,'' she said.

   Americans lag far behind their foreign
competitors in knowledge of languages and geography, the nation's
governors were told Saturday in a report that advocated having
children start learning a foreign language as early as the first
grade.
   ``International education is absolutely essential to American
prosperity,'' said Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, chairman of the
governors' Task Force on International Education.
   The task force report was made public at a news conference
opening the annual midwinter meeting of the National Governors'
Association.
   With governors increasingly involved in promoting foreign trade,
Democrat Gerald L. Baliles of Virginia, chairman of the NGA, set
``America in Transition, The International Frontier,'' as the theme
of the 1989 winter meeting.
   ``The international economy is something governors live with
every day,'' said Baliles. ``It is tangible and immediate.''
   The Virginia governor added that ``the rules have changed; the
conditions have shifted and the stakes are high in what we do next.''
   Kean, a Republican now in his last year in office, said,
``International education is not really a priority now in most of
our nation's schools.''
   He urged his fellow governors ``to take the lead in creating
international education programs'' in their states.
   The annual governors conference will lack a customary feature of
the sessions _ a White House meeting with the president.
   President Bush will not return from his trip to Japan, China and
South Korea in time to sit down with the governors whose meeting
ends on Tuesday.
   While NGA meetings during President Reagan's eight years in
office often reflected tension between the White House and governors
over budget priorities, there was no sign of similar confrontation
this year.
   An Associated Press survey of governors found little enthusiasm
for challenging Bush's resolve to resist new taxes as a means of
reducing the budget deficit.
   ``I don't see how he can abandon his read my lips promise this
early in the term,'' said Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, chairman of
the Democratic Governors Association.
   Clinton referred to Bush's campaign vow to resist any new taxes.
   Formal sessions of the NGA open on Sunday when the governors will
meet with Richard Darman, White House budget director, and will get
an assessment of the international outlook from former Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger.
   Also on the agenda for the opening day was a session with Carla
Hills, the new U.S. trade representative.
   ``More than ever before our economic well-being is intertwined
with that of other countries through expanding international trade,
financial markets and investments,'' said the task force report.
   Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, a Republican, was chairman of the
task force which also included two Democrats _ Gov. John Waihee of
Hawaii and Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota.
   They called for greater emphasis on international education and
cited innovative programs already put in place by ``enlightened and
enterprising'' schools, districts and universities.
   ``But these are pockets of progress in an otherwise indifferent
America,'' the report said.
   The task force cited a Gallup poll of adults designed to test
their knowledge of geography. It found that one in seven adults
could not locate the United States on a world map and that half
could not locate South Africa.
   On language training, the report said, ``The vast majority of
U.S. citizens cannot speak a language other than English.
   ``Language instruction in this country begins in the later grades
_ generally high school _ while children in other nations begin to
learn a second language in elementary school.''
   The task force urged their fellow governors to ``offer
opportunities to elementary school students for foreign language
instruction beginning as early as the first grade.
   ``All students should have the opportunity to learn to speak a
second language in their early years.''
   The report also cited the need for improved training of teachers
in international studies and foreign languages.
   It cited the fact that several states have recently added a
foreign language requirement to admission standards at public
colleges and universities.

   Eleven members of Congress appealed Saturday
for a cease-fire in Sudan's civil war so that food aid and other
humanitarian relief efforts can be expedited.
   The action followed testimony at a Senate hearing Thursday
indicating that hundreds of thousands of civilians may die this year
unless shipments of food and medicine are allowed to reach needy
Sudanese before the onset of the rainy season weeks from now makes
shipments difficult or impossible.
   The lawmakers voiced their appeal in telegrams sent to Sudanese
Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and Col. John Garang, leader of the
rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Movement.
   ``We call upon both parties to the war to adopt an immediate
temporary cease-fire to facilitate the delivery of food and other
humanitarian relief until the rainy season begins,'' the messages
said.
   Senators signing the telegrams included Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
the committee's ranking Republican; Paul Simon, D-Ill., chairman of
the panel's Africa subcommittee; and Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan.,
the subcommittee's ranking Republican.
   Also signing were Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Gordon J.
Humphrey, R-N.H.; Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind.; Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo.;

   New Zealand's foreign minister said Saturday he
regretted what he called ``rude'' remarks his nation's defense chief
made about the late Emperor Hirohito, the government said.
   New Zealand Defense Minister Bob Tizard said last month that
Hirohito, who died of cancer Jan. 7, should have been tried and
executed as a war criminal after World War II.
   Cedric Marshall, the foreign minister of New Zealand, told his
Japanese counterpart that ``he regrets the intemperate statements
made by some people about Japan and Emperor Showa,'' a ministry
statement said, referring to Hirohito by his posthumous name.
   Marshall, who was in Tokyo for Hirohito's funeral Friday,
``assured Uno that these rude remarks do not represent the views of
the government and people of New Zealand, and said that he hopes
these incidents will not impair the development of good bilateral
relations,'' the ministry said.
   Uno replied that he hoped to further strengthen ties between the
two countries, it said.

<HEAD>After Tough Times, Labor Leaders See Better Days Ahead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAL HARBOUR, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lane Kirkland, full-time labor activist
and part-time philosopher, offered a surprisingly short answer when
asked last week to assess the state of the American labor movement.
   ``It's good,'' the president of the 14.1 million-member AFL-CIO
said with a smile as the federation's leadership held its annual
meeting.
   Some might disagree, but labor leaders are feeling more confident
these days, upbeat in the belief that a new president, tight labor
market and soaring corporate profits mean there are better days _
and contracts _ ahead.
   ``We've weathered tolerably well a period in which we've had a
difficult legislative and political and economic climate,'' Kirkland
said when asked to expand on his assessment.
   That was a not-so veiled swipe at the Reagan administration,
which union leaders consider the most anti-union of the century and
the cause of the trade deficit that has made imports more attractive
than U.S. products.
   But Kirkland and other labor leaders do not place the blame for
the declining stature of unions on Reagan alone, conceding that
labor has been slow to change its ways in a swiftly changing economy.
   ``A labor force has grown up around us that's new in many
respects and we have not yet organized it to the extent that we want
to and that we expect to be able to over the course of time,''
Kirkland said. ``We've been through cycles like this before in our
history and emerged stronger, and I think we will again.''
   Labor hopes to prove it is again a major force in the U.S.
workplace and economy by winning better wage agreements this year,
after several years of post-recession focus on job security.
   ``It's time that we share economically in the profits,'' said
Lynn Williams, president of the United Steelworkers union, which saw
its membership and stature dive when the U.S. steel industry hit
hard times.
   Like some airline and other unions, the Steelworkers were forced
into concessions to keep jobs. The steel industry is not back to the
capacity it once had, but many companies are again profitable and
Williams is looking for a piece of prosperity.
   So are 675,000 communications and electrical workers at American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph and the regional phone companies _ the
so-called Baby Bells _ most of whose contracts expire this year.
   The Communication Workers of America and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, traditionally bitter enemies, for
the first time are negotiating jointly with the phone companies,
which have had huge profits since the AT&amp;T breakup.
   ``Wages that reflect the profitability of these companies,'' was
at the top of the list when CWA President Morton Bahr was asked
about objectives for the talks.
   Low unemployment has made competition for available workers keen,
slowly driving up wages. Most economists believe the rate of that
acceleration is due to quicken. The shortage of highly skilled
workers is particularly keen, something union negotiators hope to
parlay into significant wage gains in return for cooperative
labor-management efforts on training and retraining.
   Symbolically, labor sees in President Bush someone with whom it
disagrees on a number of issues but nonetheless a man without the
pro-business, anti-union ideological bent it perceived in Reagan.
The former president's firing of air traffic controllers in 1981,
labor leaders say, sent a signal to corporate boardrooms that union
bashing was in order.
   New Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole extolled the virtues of
collective bargaining during her visit with the labor leaders last
week, drawing kudos from the union officials despite some obvious
differences on issues.
   Organized labor also is looking to redirect its organizing
efforts to reverse a slide that has seen union representation of the
American workforce drop below 17 percent.
   A report on that subject was to be the highlight of the AFL-CIO
meeting, but the committee working on the project was unable to
reach consensus on proposals that could include revolutionary _ some
involved prefer the word evolutionary _ changes in union control
over individual locals.

<TEXT>
   With every passing day of blue skies,
water experts are growing more and more pessimistic that the state
can avoid an unprecedented third year of drought that would lead to
strict water rationing.
   ``After the dry January, a lot of my optimism faded,'' said Bob
Vasconcellos, resources and planning manager for the San Francisco
Water Department.
   ``I'm preparing for another year of this. January is normally the
wettest month in most areas. If you don't get the rain in January,
your chances (of recovery) are pretty slim.''
   As of Feb. 1, statewide precipitation for the winter was 35
percent below average, runoff was 55 percent below normal, and
reservoirs were only about 40 percent full. With each additional dry
week, the chances for recovery grow more slim.
   Weekend skiers find the mountains covered with a powdery snow.
Shrunken reservoirs reveal bare terraces of sand; rivers run in
ever-smaller channels through bone-dry rock beds. Forests are
spotted orange-red with dying trees, and anxious farmers watch their
tractors kick up dust where there should be mud.
   Unless California gets significant precipitation in the next few
weeks, officials say, much of the state will suffer hardships
rivaling those of the 1976-77 drought, when the state economy lost
$2.4 billion. The only area that will probably escape the most
stringent rationing is Southern California.
   ``The worst case would put us back where we were in '77, the last
big drought,'' said Gayle Montgomery, spokesman for the East Bay
Municipal Utility District in Oakland.
   ``That means loss of landscaping, pretty severe cutbacks in all
ways. ... It is no a pleasant thing to go through.''
   The East Bay district, like the San Francisco Water Department
across the bay, implemented 25 percent mandatory water rationing
last year. With an eye on their shrinking Sierra Nevada reservoirs,
both agencies are drafting further cutbacks.
   They are not alone. Depending on the severity of a continued
drought, a survey by the Department of Water Resources of 112
agencies found 60 to 76 plan mandatory rationing, up from 27
agencies in 1988.
   ``If this year is as critical as it was the last two years, there
will be considerable water rationing throughout California,'' said
Bill Helms of the Water Resources Department.
   Growers in the fertile San Joaquin Valley, facing cutbacks in
state water allocations of up to 40 percent and cuts in federal
allocations of up to 50 percent, are preparing to idle fields and
grow less thirsty and less profitable crops. The cutback in federal
Central Valley Project water is only the second in the project's
54-year history.
   Jason Peltier, manager of the Central Valley Project Water
Association, said a third drought year could cost agribusiness $1
billion in lost crops and up to $3 billion in losses in labor,
processing, packaging, transportation and other agriculture-related
industries.
   Most cities won't determine exact rationing plans until April,
the official end of the rainy season. Water experts say the outlook
could still improve, recalling Northern California floods in
Februrary 1986. But pessimism is growing.
   The San Francisco Water Department, which serves 2.1 million
people in San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, is developing
drought plans ranging from voluntary conservation to 35 percent
mandatory cuts.
   People in Southern California could fare much better, thanks to
diversified water supplies from the Owens Valley, the State Water
Project and a surplus of Colorado River water.
   ``The way things look right now, we should have enough water for
the coming year,'' said Tim Skrove, spokesman for the Metropolitan
Water District, which wholesales 2 million acre-feet to 14.5 million
people in Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange, San Diego, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties.
   ``We're still a little bit dry, but not nearly as bad as Northern
California,'' said Greg Starmack, spokesman for the San Diego County
Water Authority. The agency may seek voluntary conservation, but
primarily to reduce heavy demand on its delivery system during peak
hours.

<HEAD>Accused Shoplifters Used Youths, Retarded In Merchandise Scam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A shoplifting scheme broken by police
allegedly used teen-agers and mentally retarded people to return
stolen merchandise for cash refunds in stores throughout the region,
authorities said Saturday.
   At least five people were involved in the operation that
allegedly netted thousands of dollars in hardware, appliances and
clothing in stores from Bennington, Vt., to Pittsfield, Mass.,
police said.
   The youths and retarded people were used to protect the
ringleaders from exposure, said Detective Robert J. Canale. Young
people, usually between 13 and 15, and the mentally retarded were
less likely to refuse to participate, he said. It was possible, he
added, that the retarded people might receive less scrutiny at the
return counters of stores.
   ``They would give them a small gratuity for doing it for them,''
Canale said. ``They would steal it out of the store, come right out
into the parking lot and have someone else go right in and return
it. We had $2,000 to $3,000 stolen in one day in North Adams.''
   So far two people have been arrested and charged. Both pleaded
innocent.
   ``I expect to make another arrest within the next three to four
days, and probably we're looking at a couple more after that,''
Canale said.
   None of the youths or mentally retarded people had been arrested,
Canale said, and he did not have an exact count of how often they
had been used by the ringleaders to return goods.
   The stolen goods ranged from video cassette recorders to chain
saws to electric blankets. Not all the stolen property was returned
for cash, Canale said.
   Detective James Burdick, who also worked on the investigation,
was critical of return policies at some stores, where goods were
returned without sales slips with apparent ease.
   Canale added that some stores were not even able to confirm that
some stolen goods had been taken from their shelves.
   The shoplifting operation moved north from western Massachusetts
into Vermont and went on for several months, possibly as long as a
year, Canale said. The investigation began Jan. 13 with a report of
four stolen VCRs from a K-Mart store in North Adams.
   ``There was a lot of merchandise that was returned that we don't
know about,'' Canale said.

<HEAD>Machinists, Families Make Preparations For Possible Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Machinists and their families battened down the
hatches and strike preparations swung into full gear as a 16-month
contract dispute with money-losing Eastern Airlines went down to the
wire.
   Some held out hope for a last-minute settlement that would avert
a strike when a 30-day cooling-off period expires at midnight
Friday. The walkout also could be delayed for 60 days, if President
Bush follows a recommendation from the National Mediation Board that
he declare a presidential emergency.
   Employees were uncertain what the future holds.
   ``I'm not really drowning in fear of what's going to happen March
4,'' said Ted Ramirez, a 25-year Eastern employee. ``I still have
total faith in (Machinists leader) Charlie Bryan. I think he'll pull
us out'' before a strike.
   Last-ditch mediation began last week in Washington to resolve
differences between management and the 8,500-member union. The
airline is seeking $150 million in wage concessions; the Machinists
want raises totaling $50 million.
   Eastern has vowed to continue operating in the event of a strike.
The company contends its survival is at stake as it seeks wage
concessions from its largest union, which represents mechanics,
baggage handlers and other ground-services workers.
   Unless there is a settlement or Bush takes action, the company
will be free to impose its terms on workers after the cooling-off
period ends Friday. Presidential spokesman B. Jay Cooper,
accompanying Bush on his trip to the Far East, said the president
will consult with the labor, transportation and justice departments
before deciding whether to block the strike.
   Machinists, who overwhelmingly voted to support a strike
sanction, have been bolstered by backing from the AFL-CIO and say
they're ready for a strike, if that happens.
   ``I'm not looking forward to it. However, it's something that has
got to be done,'' said Tom Minick, an eight-year Eastern veteran.
   The labor turmoil has led many machinists' families to keep a
tight rein on their finances and shore up their savings. But many
worry about making it through a strike if it lasts more than a few
months.
   ``We considered buying a car. We're not. We considered home
improvements. We're not. Everything's on hold,'' said Marti Kirsch,
wife of 23-year Eastern avionics mechanic Charlie Kirsch. ``It has
been constant stress and turmoil.'' Management-labor relations at
Eastern, which have been tense for years, worsened since Texas Air
Corp. took over 2{ years ago.
   Machinists blame the Miami-based carrier's financial straits _
losses of about $1 million a day and estimated losses of $335.4
million for 1988 _ on mismanagement and say the airline just wants
to get rid of the unions.
   ``If (Texas Air chairman Frank) Lorenzo would drop out of the
picture and take his henchmen ... and put somebody from the airline
industry to run this airline, we'd start making money tomorrow,''
Ramirez said.
   Ramirez, part of a joint union-company team created in 1983 to
find ways to save money for the company, said Eastern is simply not
interested in cutting costs.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the program has been
effectively put on hold because of the contract dispute and
disagreement between the union and management on what is a
legitimate cost-saving idea.
   ``It's great in theory but not enough to put the company on sound
financial footing,'' Ms. Ceremsak said.
   Machinists are also quick to point out that non-union sister
Continental Airlines has minimal labor costs and yet still loses
money.
   Charlie Kirsch said he believes the outcome at Eastern could set
a precedent for the rest of the airline industry.
   ``The ramifications are so immense, no can really look into the
future and see what the airline industry will be like five years
from now,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Kirsch says that at 52 and with nearly 24 years under
his belt at Eastern, he doesn't relish the prospect of having to
start over if the carrier collapses.
   ``Hopefully, it will never come to that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Serbians Ask For Weapons Amid Protests; Gov't Pledges More Troops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SLOBODAN LEKIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serbians asked authorities Saturday
for weapons to defend themselves amid growing protests by the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo province. Officials announced they were
sending more troops and police.
   Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians have walked off their jobs
since Monday, shutting down shops, schools and public
transportation. They are protesting a constitutional change and
demanding the resignation of the provincial Communist Party chief.
   ``We are threatened,'' said a statement from a group of Serbian
activists in Kosovo Polje, a Pristina suburb.
   The activists demanded the government introduce ``extraordinary
measures'' in Kosovo, an autonomous province in the republic of
Serbia.
   ``If they don't want to introduce martial law, then they should
give us arms to defend ourselves with because the situation is
critical,'' said Kosta Bulatovuc, a local Serbian leader, at the
meeting.
   Later Saturday, Yugoslavia's government said it would send more
troops and police to the province to protect ``the functioning of
vital services,'' the state-run Tanjug news service reported.
   ``The undertaking of other measures ... is also considered,'' the
report said without elaboration.
   The number of additional security forces was not disclosed.
   The action by was still one step away from the introduction of
martial law, decreed in 1981 after nine people were killed in ethnic
rioting.
   The protests began Monday at the Trepca mine, where about 1,300
lead and zinc miners, some on a hunger strike, remained in their
pits for a sixth day.
   Thirty miners were hospitalized Saturday with exhaustion, and 60
asked for medical aid at the mine, Tanjug said.
   Riza Muslimi, a spokesman for the striking miners, said they have
stashed two tons of explosives underground, but he would not say
whether they intended to use them to demolish the shaft if their
demands were not met.
   The protesters have condemned Serbia's drive to gain greater
control over Kosovo by changing the constitution, fearing they would
lose the wide autonomy granted to them in 1974. They also demand the
resignation of provincial party leader Rahman Morina, whom they
consider an ally of Serbian leaders aiming for more control over
Kosovo.
   The constitutional change would give Serbia greater control over
its two provinces, Kosovo and Vojvodina, and increase its powers
over defense and state security. The proposed change was approved by
Serbia on Thursday, but the amendments must also be approved by the
provincial assemblies.
   Serbian leaders say they must have more control in Kosovo to
protect the mainly Christian Slav minority from alleged persecution
by predominantly Moslem ethnic Albanians, who make up 85 percent of
the province's population.
   Saip Ljatifi, director of the Golesh magnesite mine, said his 360
striking ethnic Albanian miners ``would prefer to die rather than
repeat the experience'' of direct Serbian rule.
   In November, up to 100,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated in
Pristina for five days to protest the dismissal of senior provincial
officials as demanded by Serbia's leaders.
   Tanjug said that Yugoslav leaders have told the protesters the
proposed constitutional changes do not mean the reduction of
Kosovo's autonomy feared by ethnic Albanians.

<TEXT>
   Gov. George Mickelson is asking churchgoers
in the state to offer a special prayer for rain next month to break
the drought that's parched much of the state since 1987.
   ``I think the focus of this is on the devastation that this
situation has for the families that depend on moisture for livestock
and crop production in this state,'' the governor said Friday.
   Mickelson proclaimed Palm Sunday, March 19, as a special day of
prayer for the farmers, ranchers, small business owners and others
harmed by the dry spell.
   Most South Dakota farm families survived the first full year of
drought last year, but ``a second year would be devastating,'' he
said.
   The dry conditions have eased in the eastern parts of the state,
Mickelson said, but the central and western portions of South Dakota
are still in the midst of mild to severe drought.
   ``I would give almost anything to make sure that we don't repeat
what happened last year with regard to the drought,'' he said.
``There isn't a day that goes by in my life but what I do not
continue to be concerned about the situation that we are in.''
   The federal government responded swiftly to provide aid to
farmers last year when many states were dry, but South Dakota might
find it tougher to get federal assistance this year if fewer states
are hit with drought, the governor said.
   Besides hurting farmers, another dry year year also could spark
more forest fires like the blazes that hit last summer in the Black
Hills, and could keep levels in state reservoirs below normal, he
said.

   Pair after pair of body-slamming behemoths
climb into the wrestling ring at the Monster Factory, a school of
hard knocks for those who dream of fame and fortune in the world of
professional wrestling.
   They pummel each other under the watchful eye of their mentor,
Larry Sharpe, owner of the school who is known as ``Pretty Boy'' in
the ring.
   ``They'll all become professionals,'' said Sharpe, 38. ``Some
will wrestle part-time, some full-time. Full-time, you can make
$35,000 a year to the very few who take home $2 million a year. I
have a few here who could make half a million a year.''
   The lure of big bucks and Hulk Hogan fame brings wrestlers from
around the country to Sharpe's creaky gym in this small refinery
town southwest of Philadelphia in southern New Jersey.
   Sharpe teaches them the right way to crunch an opponent, to fall
flat on their backs without chipping elbow bones, and to craft that
ring persona so important to professional wrestling.
   ``Larry's known around the world as the top trainer in
professional wrestling,'' said Dennis Coralluzzo, a promoter who
sponsors matches featuring many of the Monster Factory's products.
``He's trained many who have made the big time, like Bam Bam
Bigelow, King Kong Bundy, Kevin Von Erick and Tony Atlas.''
   Promotional photos of wrestling biggies and old posters
advertising wrestling matches hang from every wall in the gym.
Punching bags and a room filled with weights allow the wrestlers to
build up their bulk. In a ring at the back of the gym, the wrestlers
work on their routines.
   Outside the ring, the wrestlers, some wearing garb to fit their
ring personalities, talk up a storm.
   ``People don't realize there are supermen in the world, and I am
one of them,'' said The Ultimate Party Animal, otherwise known as
Paul Fine, a 27-year-old electrician from Laurence Harbor.
   ``My goal is to gain the trust and admiration of all the people
out there,'' bellowed the gigantic Chief Thundermountain, 25, a
Blackfoot Indian known in Bordentown Township as David Mosier.
   Inside the Monster Factory ring, the big guys throw body slams at
each other, careen off the ropes and fall to the hard floor with
thundering crashes. They groan with pain, then quickly turn the
match around with a few fast moves.
   Sharpe scoffs at the notion that professional wrestlers rely more
on gimmickry than guts even though the World Wrestling Federation
recently admitted to a state legislative panel that it's more
entertainment than sport. The federation wants to be exempted from
New Jersey's tough and costly regulations on sporting events.
   ``They've got to have coordination and agility,'' Sharpe said.
``They've got to take pain. Yes, it does look choreographed
sometimes. But it's like football. When you see an offense coming,
you're trained to react to it defensively.''
   Frank ``Frankie Angel'' Dempsky, 26, of Burlington Township
insists he never knows how a match will turn out.
   ``That's where people get it wrong,'' he said. ``They say it's
all choreographed. But I've had bones broken, and muscles torn. I've
had chairs busted over my head, and once I woke up partially
paralyzed, wondering if I was going to be crippled for life. You
don't choreograph that.''

   A 6-year-old girl was in critical condition with
head wounds after clashes with Israeli troops Saturday, and the army
chief vowed to avenge the death of a soldier killed when Arabs
dropped a cement block on his head.
   Arab doctors said Israeli troops fired rubber-coated steel
pellets and live ammunition at Palestinian stone-throwers in Gaza's
Rafah refugee camp, wounding a 20-year-old man and the girl,
identified as Lulu Mahmoud Abu Dahi. They said she suffered a broken
skull and was in critical condition.
   The hospital officials reported seven other Palestinians wounded
in clashes throughout the occupied territories.
   An army official confirmed two wounded, including the 6-year-old
girl, who he said was ``badly wounded in the head'' and transferred
to Tel Hashomer Hospital near Tel Aviv. All spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, the army enforced a curfew and
raided dozens of homes in search of Palestinians who killed Sgt.
Binyamin Meisner on Friday by dropping a 33-pound cement block on
him from a rooftop.
   The army's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Dan Shomron, vowed to step
up army control over the occupied lands in response to the slaying
of Meisner, 24, a reserve paratrooper. He was killed in the city's
open air market.
   ``There is no doubt we will respond in this area ... and the
price will be heavy,'' Shomron said during a tour of Nablus, the
West Bank's largest city with 120,000 residents.
   Arab reports said troops searched houses in various parts of the
city, and several Palestinians were rounded up for questioning.
Shots were heard in the city throughout the day Saturday, the
reports said.
   Meisner was the sixth soldier to be killed since the December
1987 start of the Palestinian uprising. At least 385 Palestinians
and 17 Israelis have been killed.
   Shomron and the West Bank's army commander, Gen. Amram Mitzna,
vowed to expand army presence in Nablus and the occupied lands.
   ``We learned that the one who rules in the streets of the casbah
is the one who rules over the city,'' Mitzna said on Israel
television.
   In other developments, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said in an
interview broadcast Saturday the Soviet Union was harming the
chances of a Middle East settlement by insisting on the convening of
an international peace conference.
   ``What is the use of putting together some kind of international
conference that would lead to frustrations, even belligerency?''
Arens said in an interview with Israel radio.
   ``I think that if those Arab countries that say they will not
negotiate with Israel directly were to be told by the Soviet Union
`that's what you ought to do, negotiate directly' ... then I think
we would be moving the peace process forward,'' he said.
   Arens met Wednesday in Cairo with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, and the two failed to bridge their differences over
the international conference.
   The Soviet Union insists Israel approve a conference that will
include the Palestine Liberation Organization, an idea Israel
rejects. Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization.

   A cold wave that stunned the Deep South broke low
temperature records all across Florida on Saturday, and an elderly
woman froze to death in an unheated home in the northern part of the
Sunshine State.
   Farther north, a powerful storm that dumped as much as 2 feet of
snow on the middle Atlantic states on Friday buffeted the New
England coast with wind up to 52 mph and snow while moving away
toward Nova Scotia.
   The arctic air that poured into Florida sent the mercury plunging
from the Panhandle all the way to Key West, the southern-most point
on the continental United States.
   Florida's rich citrus growing region reported minor crop damage
after the second night of record cold.
   But the cold snap was expected to ease slightly and the trend was
to warmer temperatures by Sunday night, said National Weather
Service forecaster Fred Gonzalez.
   ``The worst is over,'' he said.
   Florida's lowest temperature overnight was a record 18 degrees in
the northern part of the state at the capital city of Tallahassee.
   Other records in the state were 28 at Apalachicola, 29 at Daytona
Beach, 35 at Fort Lauderdale, 35 at Fort Myers, 36 at Hollywood, 24
at Jacksonville, 51 at Key West, 37 at Miami, 39 at Miami Beach, 30
at Orlando, 27 at Pensacola, 31 at Tampa and 35 at West Palm Beach.
In neighboring Alabama, Mobile tied its record of 27 and Montgomery
tied its record of 22.
   But while Florida shivered, Dodge City, Kan., posted a record
high Saturday of 80 degrees.
   Just outside the capital in Miccosukee, police said a 65-year-old
woman froze to death in her unheated home. She was discovered
unconscious by a concerned neighbor and paramedics could not revive
her.
   ``This is an extremely rare occurrence in Leon County,''
sheriff's spokesman Dick Simpson said.
   The death prompted deputies to visit other unheated homes late
Friday to check on residents, he said.
   In other cities around Florida, shelters filled up with homeless
people who usually sleep on the streets in more hospitable weather.
   In Broward County the Salvation Army set up cots in the dining
room and put people on floors and in hallways to make certain no one
was left out in the cold.
   The biggest economic worry caused by the cold was in the Central
Florida citrus belt, which suffered a diastrous freeze in 1985, but
the region appeared to have avoided the worst this time.
   ``Florida citrus growers for the most part escaped signficant
damage from Friday night and Saturday morning's freezing
temperatures, which dipped into almost all of the state's citrus
growing areas,'' said Dick Whalley of the Florida Citrus Mutual, a
growers cooperative, in Lakeland.
   He said extended cold in some low-lying areas probably harmed new
blossoms, but it will be weeks before the full damage can be
determined.
   Many farmers battled the frost with smudge pots or sprinklers.
   ``I've been out all night,'' Jerry Chicone, a partner in Chicone
Groves west of Orlando, said Saturday morning. Damage to his groves
was minimal, he said.
   Some farmers were less fortunate, however.
   David Coney, an Alachua County blueberry grower, estimated his
loss at 90 percent. Coney said a neighbor who grows apples also lost
a substantial amount of fruit.
   ``I had some early-ripening varieties and they got clobbered,''
Coney said. ``That's just one of the risk factors in farming. If I
wanted a sure winner, I'd play the lottery.''
   In Miami, Gary Mehalik, spokesman for the Florida Power &amp; Light
Co., which serves 3 million South Florida customers, said the
utility hit a record for power-use between 7 and 8 a.m. Saturday, a
time when commercial and industrial demand is low.
   ``Eighty-two percent of our customers have electric heat,'' he
said. ``That uses up a lot of electricity when people roll out of
bed in the morning and turn on the heat.''

   The Sudanese Cabinet met in an emergency
session Saturday and ordered Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi to form a
new broad-based government, the information minister said.
   Minister Beshir Omar did not say when the new government would be
formed.
   Last week, the military gave el-Mahdi a week to either resign or
reform his government and seek peace with the rebels fighting it.
   El-Mahdi later said he was told by the army that the one-week
deadline was not final. He will address the political situation
Monday in a speech to Parliament, Omar said.
   Omar did not say whether the nation's Democratic Unionist Party,
which quit the government to protest el-Mahdi's policies, would be
invited to join the new government.
   The party quit in December because el-Mahdi refused to endorse a
tentative peace agreement the party signed with the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation army.
   On Saturday, the party issued a statement urging el-Mahdi to form
a new government as a gesture of good will and immediately carry out
the peace plan.
   The rebels took up arms in 1983, and have demanded economic and
administrative reforms. In the past few months, they have taken over
several strategic government garrisons in the south.

   The storm that rattled the East Coast
with high wind and snow was the undoing of three men charged with
breaking into a market _they apparently never thought about leaving
tracks in fresh snow.
   Officers responding to a burglary alarm at the Woodmere Quick
Mart early Friday found a broken window and three sets of footprints
in the snow leading away from the window.
   Police followed the tracks for about a quarter of a mile, through
a wooded area, across a creek and up to an apartment, where they
made the arrests.
   Detective H.C. Tysinger said the only thing taken during the
break-in was a pistol. The cash drawer taken from the market
contained no money.
   ``I don't understand that kind of reasoning _ going out in the
snow and leaving a trail for police,'' Tysinger said. ``It wasn't
very smart.''

   Unlike the movies, in which police chase
bad guys at top speed, a Bellefonte police car never left low gear
while an officer tried to get a fugitive to stop. And the fugitive
got away.
   The police car and the old Allis-Chalmers tractor the fugitive
was driving reached a top speed of 15 mph on the more than two-mile
pursuit late Thursday.
   Finally, the driver of the farm tractor pulled onto a field and
fled on foot, leaving behind frozen food, generic cigarettes, beer
and a chain saw.

you have that much trouble pulling over a tractor,'' police
dispatcher Eric Naylor said.
   Police had no leads in the case, dispatcher Rich Kelley said
Saturday.
   The chase began when a police officer noticed the tractor driving
through the central Pennsylvania town of 6,300 people and pulled it
over, Naylor said.
   When the officer asked for the driver's identification, the man
drove away.

<HEAD>Presidential Elections Set for August</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran will hold presidential elections in
August, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Saturday. The vote
could be a key test between so-called pragmatists and their
hard-line opponents in the Islamic republic.
   It will be the fifth presidential election since the republic was
proclaimed in 1979.
   Hardliners, who now appear to be backed by Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, are battling the so-called pragmatists, who seek
liberalization in Iran and closer links with the West.
   Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi announced the election in
an interview published Saturday in Tehran's Kayhan daily, the news
agency said in a report monitored in Nicosia.
   It quoted him as saying there will be polls for local and
regional councils after the presidential ballot.
   IRNA said the date of the election will be announced after
coordination between the Interior Ministry and the Council of
Guardians, a 12-member body that oversees legislation.
   President Ali Khamenei, the Islamic republic's third president
who has been in office since 1981, cannot run for a third four-year
term under the revolutionary constitution.
   Mohtashemi, a hardliner believed to have close links with Shiite
Moslem extremists holding Western hostages in Lebanon, said he will
not run.
   But Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of the
so-called pragmatists, indicated earlier this month he might be a
candidate.
   ``I have not yet decided. But it seems that I will have to be a
candidate,''' he said in an interview with French television.
   Khamenei, who has been allied with Rafsanjani, noted in an
interview carried by Kayhan on Feb. 6: ``When someone looks at the
Iranian stage, the focus will be Hashemi Rafsanjani. I don't think
there's anyone else attracting one's eyes.''
   Former Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan has said his small Iran
Freedom Movement, Iran's token opposition party which has been
harassed by hardliners for eight years, will field a candidate if
the political climate is ``appropriate.''
   Rafsanjani and others have been trying to amend the December 1979
constitution to focus executive power in the presidency by dropping
the post of prime minister.
   They argue the emergence of several competing power centers has
undermined Iran's decision-making process and believe Iran needs a
clearly defined system to tackle postwar reconstruction and end
ideological divisions.
   Executive authority has been concentrated on the premiership
since the republic's first president, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, tried to
widen his powers in 1980-81 before he was forced to flee into exile
during a purge of liberals and left-wingers by revolutionary zealots.
   Iran's second president, Mohammad Ali Rajaie was assassinated in
September 1981, along with Prime Minister Mohammad Javad Bahonar, in
a terrorist bombing at Bahonar's Tehran headquarters.
   Rafsanjani, who also is acting commander-in-chief, was considered
the most powerful figure after Khomeini, but it is not clear whether
he and his allies have been weakened by Khomeini's support for
hardliners.
   Some radicals fear that concentrating power in the presidency
will transform Iran into an authoritarian state.

<TEXT>
   A juror took his courtroom seat with a carnation
and a newlywed's smile after a judge eager to start a trial
performed a wedding, gave the couple a 10-minute honeymoon and
struck the opening gavel.
   Supreme Court Justice Martin Stecher was exasperated when a juror
announced his wedding day was set for Feb. 17, when trial was
finally to begin after two delays in a $20 million lawsuit against
the city.
   The trial was postponed once because the wife of an attorney was
having a Caesarean section, and a second time because another lawyer
was closing a house-buying deal, the New York Post reported.
   Then the juror, a man in his 30s who was not otherwise
identified, asked that the Feb. 17 date be set aside too so he could
get married.
   ``No way,'' the judge said. ``Tell the juror to bring his bride,
a license, two witnesses _ and I'll marry them.''

   He's a mechanic at Al's Gas station in Brooklyn
and she works at a bowling alley. They've been married 25 years and
always lived from week to week, never able to afford a home of their
own or a honeymoon.
   But that's all changing for Lou and Mary Anne Profeta, who had
the only winning ticket in Wednesday night's Lotto jackpot of $26.9
million.
   ``Lou is a dreamer. We always thought we would be rich someday,''
said Mrs. Profeta, 46, at a news conference Friday. The numbers,
chosen by Mrs. Profeta, include their wedding date, her husband's
birthday and some random figures.
   Profeta, 47, said Friday was the first day he had missed work in
30 years.
   The couple, who have a 22-year-old daughter, plan to buy a home
for Mrs. Profeta's parents and one for themselves on Long Island.
They also plan to quit work eventually.
   And Profeta will buy his wife a lynx coat.
   ``Whenever I went out with friends, I always joked with them and
asked, `Do you think I should wear my lynx coat tonight?''' Mrs.
Profeta says.
   The jackpot was the second-largest for a single winner in state
history, after the $30.2 million jackpot a Staten Island man won in
1986.

   From those same folks who gave you
blackened redfish and alligator stew, now comes Cajun caviar.
   Barely three years on the market, it is made from the eggs of a
fish known as the choupique, or cypress trout, and has caused a
culinary sensation in south Louisiana.
   Chef John Folse of Lafitte's Landing, who last year took his
culinary skills to Moscow while then-President Reagan was attending
the summit, says, ``I think it's better than their Beluga caviar.''
   It's not as salty as the Russian caviar, he said, ``and it fits
right into the Louisiana indigenous style of cooking.''
   He admits he was skeptical at first.
   ``I had some in the cooler for about a month before some people
got to talking about it one night in the bar at White Oak
Plantation,'' he said. ``I got it out and I was stunned at the
quality of it.
   ``Look at this kind of gold coming out of Louisiana!''
   Folse makes a crawfish caviar crepe, crawfish in a sour cream
sauce wrapped in a crepe with a little caviar on top, and says it's
one of the biggest sellers at his restaurant.
   John Burke, a student at Louisiana State University who is the
sole distributor for Louisiana caviar, said it is produced by a
Cajun family whose name he will not make public.
   He said their recipe is based on an early Russian one handed down
for generations. Burke said he knew about the family when he was
growing up in Cajun country, and that he made a deal with them to
market the product.

   Nobody knows where it's been for the past
three-quarters of a century, but a postcard apparently mailed from
Panama in 1911 has finally arrived at its destination.
   The card, addressed to ``Rev. Mother Superior, Ursuline Convent,
New Orleans, La.,'' bears a one-centesimo stamp of the Republic of
Panama.
   It has two postmarks: one scarcely legible but the other clearly
reading, ``New Orleans, La. Aug. 15, 1911.'' The message is dated
``Colon 8-7-1911,'' so the card may have been mailed from Colon, at
the eastern end of the Panama Canal _ still under construction back
then.
   On the other side is a photograph of work on the canal's Culebra
Cut.
   ``It arrived at Carrollton in the normal mail stream, along with
other first-class mail,'' Gail Borne, a spokeswoman at the U.S.
Postal Service's Carrolton Station, said Friday. ``Our policy is
that as long as we can deliver a piece of mail, no matter how old it
is, we will.''
   She said workers had noticed the 1911 postmark, but didn't know
where the card was before it got to the station. It was delivered
Thursday.
   The message from Rosario and Mariana Delgado sends their parents'
greetings and says the children would ``soon have the pleasure to be
at the dear convent again.''
   Marie Srour, a secretary at the school, said officials have not
located any records from 1911 that might show who the Delgados were.
   The school, which was founded shortly after Ursuline nuns arrived
in New Orleans in 1727, had many Central American pupils in the
early part of the 20th century.
   Officials plan to add the mysterious postcard to their archives
or to a small museum at the school. And they want to thank the
Postal Service for two things: for delivering the card and for not
charging postage due.

   A charter flight carrying more than 350
people made an unscheduled landing at Indianapolis International
Airport Saturday after a passenger joked about having explosives,
authorities said.
   Anthony Glynn Pierson, 23, of Rochester Hill, Mich., was charged
with violating the false information act and making threats, said
Sgt. John Wheeler of the Indiana State Police. The charges carry a
penalty of up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.
   The L-1011 plane was searched, nothing was found, and passengers
reboarded and continued on to Cancun, Mexico, said Robert Spitler of
the Indianapolis Airport Authority.
   American Trans Air Flight 309 from Detroit was carrying 339
passengers and a crew of 12, according to John Ashton, the airline
security director.
   The FBI said Pierson told authorities he had told the flight
attendant he had prophylactics, but Wheeler said ``many witnesses
advised he stated he had plastic explosives.''

<HEAD>Struggle For Land Behind Political Imprisonment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the political prisoners being freed
under a new amnesty program were jailed in connection with the
bitter land battles that Amnesty International calls the prime cause
of human rights abuses in Mexico.
   About 90 percent of the cases involve land disputes, Luis Ortiz
Moasterio, the Interior Ministry's human rights director, told the
government news agency Notimex on Saturday.
   Mexico's turf battles usually pit land-hungry peasants against
powerful local property owners and the rural bosses. Human rights
groups say the authorities side with the big landowners and bosses.
   Under pressure from human rights activists, President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari said Thursday that he would free 403 prisoners,
one of them a prominent poet and activist who was released a day
later.
   Opposition figures welcomed the releases but demanded a
timetable, and said there were hundreds of other political prisoners
not involved in the amnesty program.
   Government officials, however, said they would work with state
officials to free another 400 prisoners.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human right organization,
has for years expressed concern about arbitrary detentions, torture
and killings of Mexican peasants and Indians.
   Many of the victims of human rights violations in Mexico ``were
active in groups pursuing objectives strongly opposed by local
landowners and by local and state government authorities,'' Amnesty
said in a 1986 report.
   The struggle for land often is a catalyst for opposition
political activism by peasants and Indians who feel the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party has failed to make good on its
promises.
   The Mexican government has consistently denied the Amnesty
International reports and allegations by other human rights group.
   It continues to insist it has no political prisoners, despite the
amnesty program announced Thursday. Interior Secretary Fernando
Gutierrez Barrios has said the program is freeing people who
committed crimes for ``political or social'' reasons _ not political
prisoners.
   One of the more prominent prisoners involved in the amnesty is
poet Israel Gutierrez Hernandez, who worked with peasant groups
fighting for land rights in the north-central state of San Luis
Potosi. He had been cited by Amnesty International and several other
groups as a prisoner of conscience.
   Gutierrez Hernandez, 37, was freed on Friday after serving about
half of a 10-year sentence for robbery, criminal association and
possession of military weapons _ charges he denied.
   Officials have said about 10 of Mexico's 31 states are included
in the amnesty program.
   Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, Mexico's most prominent human rights
activist, said Saturday that peasant organizations in several states
have submitted lists of hundreds of prisoners to the government.
   The lists include people imprisoned in the states of Michoacan,
Veracruz, Chiapas and Oaxaca, she said in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press.
   Amnesty International has long monitored reports of human rights
violations in Mexico, particularly in rural areas. Its 1986 special
report concentrated on the southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas,
where arable land is scarce, subsistence farming is a way of life
and some of Mexico's most violent land disputes occur.
   Authorities have said Oaxaca is not now part of the new amnesty
program because it has no political prisoners. The official list of
prisoners slated for release did not mention Chiapas and Interior
Ministry officials contacted Saturday did not know its status.
   Land reform was a bright promise of Mexico's 1910 revolution. But
after 74 years of redistribution, many peasants are still landless
or have seen their communal land taken away by large landholders.
Clouded titles and a creaky bureaucracy further entangle the
disputes.

   A man who told authorities he was hit by
random street gunfire actually had gotten drunk and persuaded his
68-year-old aunt to pull the trigger _ an incident police described
as ``stranger than fiction.''
   Eva Jean White was charged with assault Friday, accused of
wounding her nephew, John E. Lewis, 31, with pellets from a 2-gauge
shotgun.
   ``At first, she didn't think she had hit him. But it started
stinging a little bit, and then John decided he didn't want to be
shot near as bad as he said he did,'' said Police Maj. Kenneth
Beaird.
   Beaird said the woman deliberately aimed to the side when she
pulled the trigger Wednesday morning in the home the two share in
Keokuk. Lewis was struck by about 35 pieces of buckshot and has
since been released from a hospital.
   Lewis first claimed to have been shot while walking along a
street, minding his own business, authorities said.Police revised
the report to say that Lewis had ``solicited'' Ms. White to do the
shooting.
   ``By his admission to me, John is an alcoholic, and in a drunken
state, he was trying to find somebody to shoot him,'' Beaird said.
   ``Now this old woman, she's a crusty old gal. She finally says
she got tired of hearing him, so she said, `You want me to shoot you
in the backside, then get it downstairs in the basement,''' Beaird
said.
   He said Lewis was struck with fewer than a tenth of the pellets
in the charge, but that he was ``uncomfortable, so he had to come up
with some kind of story.''
   ``You've heard that the truth is stranger than fiction? It's
true,'' Beaird said. ``This is a wormy one.''
   Beaird said Lewis has sought counseling at a mental health center.

   A plan to build a canal across Nicaragua with
Japanese backing would not threaten a proposed second canal in
Panama, Nicaragua's finance minister was quoted as saying Saturday.
   ``It's a complementary idea,'' William Huper Arguell was quoted
as saying by the Kyodo News Service. ``The growing flow of East-West
and North-South commerce brings about a need now for various types
of routes.''
   Kyodo quoted Panama's acting president, Manuel Solis Palma, as
saying: ``Every country has a right to put forward whatever plan it
wants to.''
   Nicaragua proposed the canal earlier this month, and Kyodo said
studies are expected to take about three years to complete. The
agency quoted Huper as saying construction could take up to 10 years.
   Huper and Solis attended Friday's funeral of Emperor Hirohito,
who died last month of cancer.
   Huper was quoted as saying he plans to meet with Japanese firms
and business organizations to drum up interest in the mammoth
project before leaving Tokyo on Wednesday.
   He would not elaborate on the composition of a private delegation
of Japanese scientists and builders who are scheduled to visit
Nicaragua next month in connection with the plan.
   Japanese officials have said the Tokyo government, which supports
Panama's plan for a second canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific,
does not intend to become involved in the Nicaraguan project.

   Bidders in Los Angeles vied with a studio audience
in Moscow on Saturday to buy crystal, paintings and other items in a
unique televised charity auction to raise funds for earthquake
victims.
   The broadcast, the first of its kind in the Soviet Union, was
beamed by satellite to socialist countries, Western Europe, the
United States and Japan.
   It was sponsored by Intermedbio, a joint U.S.-Soviet venture that
promotes business contacts between the two countries, and
GostelRadio, the state-run radio and television network.
   Initial bidding, via live satellite link-up, pit a studio
audience in Los Angeles against a Moscow audience of Soviet and
Western businessmen, diplomats and foreign representatives of
Soviet-based foreign firms.
   Members of the general public were not invited to the Moscow
audience, which was held at Goskino, the state cinema.
   The broadcast began at 10 p.m. and had raised more than $25,000
when it ended at midnight, officials said.
   The auction was held on behalf of those hurt or left homeless by
two earthquakes, one in Armenia Dec. 7 and another in Tadjikistan on
Jan. 24. The quake in Armenia claimed about 25,000 lives, injured at
least 19,000 and left hundreds of thousands homeless. The quake in
Tadjikistan killed about 250 people.
   Early bidding, all in dollars, raised about $10,000 in 45 minutes
with buyers taking home crystal dishes and a set of paintings by
Armenian children that brought $3,000 from a Los Angeles man.
   The bidding went dry, however, when the really expensive items
went on the block, including seven thoroughbred horses and a Soviet
tractor.
   Bidding on the tractor opened at $8,000, but it was unsold
because only one bid was received _ $2,100 from a Los Angeles man.
   ``Apparently Americans don't buy tractors on Saturday,'' the
auctioneer joked.
   The official Tass news agency said before the bidding began that
a helicopter would be put on the block as well as the world's
largest carpet made in Armenia. However, neither item was listed in
the catalogue.
   Bidding in the two-hour auction picked up again when items such
as Soviet-made watches went on the block at $50 to $100.
   ``It's a bargain,'' the auctioneer said, urging the Los Angeles
audience to buy.
   After the initial bidding, viewers at home were able to call in
bids on items not taken by the studio audiences, either by
telephoning their local studio or by facsimile or telex.
   ``The aim of the charity TV auction ... is to bring foreign
currency into the aid fund for quake victims in Armenia and
Tadjikstan,'' Tass said.
   Damage from the Armenian earthquake has been estimated at $16.2
billion, not including the long-term medical requirements of
survivors, according to Armenian officials.

<HEAD>Snowstorm Relinquishes Grip On New England</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The storm that produced heavy snow and near-hurricane force wind
along the mid-Atlantic and New England coasts moved out to sea
toward Nova Scotia on Saturday.
   The storm had developed late Thursday off the coast of the
Carolinas, then moved northward Friday to southern New Jersey, where
it dumped up to 2 feet of snow before veering to the northeast and
clipping New England.
   Cape Cod and nearby islands received 8 to 12 inches of new snow
by mid morning. Much of southeastern Massachusetts measured 5 inches
and parts of Boston reported 3 to 6 inches. Other amounts in
Massachusetts included 12 inches at Chatham, 10 inches at Falmouth,
8 inches at Martha's Vineyard and 7 inches at Marshfield.
   Southeastern Maine got 4 to 8 inches of snow. In southeastern New
Hampshire, 6 inches fell at Dover, with 5 inches at Hampton,
Rochester and Nashua.
   The storm also kicked up high waves that caused severe beach
erosion on the Outer Banks off the coast of North Carolina.
   Also in North Carolina, melting snow turned to ice early Saturday
when temperatures hit the mid-teens and turned Interstate 95 near
Rocky Mount, N.C., into a treacherous snarl of sliding cars, said
Brian Brantley, assistant emergency management coordinator in Nash
County.
   Cold air retained its grip on the extreme South.
   Record lows in Florida were 28 at Apalachicola, 29 at Daytona
Beach, 35 at Fort Lauderdale, 35 at Fort Myers, 36 at Hollywood, 24
at Jacksonville, 51 at Key West, 37 at Miami, 39 at Miami Beach, 30
at Orlando, 27 at Pensacola, 31 at Tampa, 18 at Tallahassee and 35
at West Palm Beach. In Alabama, Mobile tied its record of 27 and
Montgomery tied its record of 22. Atlantic City, N.J., hit a record
12.
   On the other hand, Dodge City, Kan., posted a record high
Saturday of 80 degrees. Goodland, Kan., tied its record of 75.
Temperatures were in the low 70s as far north as southwestern
Nebraska.
   Elsewhere, snow showers were scattered across southern and
eastern Montana into North Dakota, with accumulations expected to
remain below 3 inches in many areas.
   Snow showers also were scattered across Upper Michigan and
northern Lower Michigan as warmer air spread into the upper Great
Lakes region.
   Low pressure well off the central California coast spread clouds
and scattered showers across central California, but much of the
rainfall was light.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 13
degrees at Caribou and Limestone, Maine, to 88 degrees at Santee,
Calif., outside San Diego. Saturday's low for the Lower 48 states
was 11 degrees below zero at Massena, N.Y.
   For Sunday, snow was forecast across much of the Great Lakes
region into the upper Ohio Valley and central Appalachians, with
rain changing to snow from southern Indiana and southern Ohio into
western West Virginia. Scattered rain was forecast over the lower
Ohio and the Tennessee valleys. Snow also was forecast from the
northern Rockies into central and eastern Wyoming through North
Dakota into northern Minnesota.
   Highs in the teens and 20s were predicted from the northern high
Plains through the upper Mississippi Valley and the upper Great
Lakes into the northern half of New England; in the 30s from the
northern Plateau across the middle Missouri Valley and the lower

   Stone-throwing students clashed with police
at a rally to protest police beatings at an earlier demonstration,
and the state news agency said 39 policemen were injured.
   Police fired water cannons and tear gas to break up the rally
Friday in the southern city of Krakow, the PAP news agency said.
Twenty-four protesters were held for questioning but later released,
it said.
   Opposition spokesmen said hundreds of students had gathered to
protest the police beatings of demonstrators at a rally Feb. 17
against political indoctrination in schools.
   In a separate development Saturday, police detained 20 opposition
supporters in the southern mining town of Jastrzebie on their way to
attend a congress of independent political activists there, an
opposition spokeswoman said.
   Sabina Marcinska, spokeswoman for the Confederation For
Independent Poland, a nationalist group, said 100 activists had
planned to attend the congress Saturday in an undisclosed location.
She said she did not know if they had been able to meet.
   Ms. Marcinska spoke by telephone from the industrial city of
Katowice in southern Poland.
   Earlier, another opposition spokeswoman said four people had been
detained in the southwestern city of Wroclaw in connection with the
congress. She spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The clash Friday in Krakow began when police asked the protesters
not to block traffic, PAP said. The students responded by hurling
stones and jars of red paint at police, who responded by firing tear
gas into the crowd, the report said.
   Two of the 39 injured policemen were in the hospital and 15 cars
were damaged during the demonstration, PAP said.
   The protesters included supporters of several illegal opposition
groups, including the Independent Students' Union, The Confederation
for Independent Poland, Freedom and Peace and Fighting Solidarity, a
radical splinter group of the banned union.
   In the Feb. 17 rally, two protesters were taken away in ambulance
and at least several others were beaten, according to a student
activist in Krakow who decined to give his name.
   Police detained at least six people during that demonstration,
but they were later released. Krakow has been the site of numerous
demonstrations by young people in recent weeks.

   A court on Saturday convicted seven
people, including five organized crime figures, in a 1984 train
bombing that killed 16 Christmas travelers and wounded more than 200.
   A panel of judges acquitted two people after ruling there was
insufficient evidence to tie them to the Dec. 23, 1984 bombing of an
express train as it passend through a tunnel between Florence and
Bologna.
   Five of the defendants were sentenced to life in prison,
including Giuseppe ``Pippo'' Calo, an alleged Sicilian Mafia crime
figure.
   Prosecutors said right-wing terrorists conspired with the Mafia
and the Camorra, its Naples-based counterpart, to carry out the
bombing.
   The prosecution alleged that organized crime figures wanted to
use the bombing to distract authorities investigating the mob, the
prosecutors said.
   Also sentenced to life in prison were alleged Calo associate
Guido Cercola, reputed underworld boss Giuseppe Misso and two of his
alleged lieutenants, Alfonso Galeota and Giulio Pirozzi.
   Franco Agostino, who was accused of being linked to Calo in the
bombing, was sentenced to 28 years. Friedrich Schaudinn of West
Germany, charged with supplying the timing device used to detonate
the bomb, was sentenced to 25 years.

   A 12-year-old boy has been charged as a
juvenile with murder and attempted murder in connection with the
fatal shooting of his mother and the wounding of his father, police
said Saturday.
   Matthew Nupp was being held at the Alfred Knolls Juvenile
Detention Center in Rockville after he allegedly shot his mother
three times with a .22 caliber hunting rifle Friday.
   Police said Nupp, a student at Parkland Junior High School in
Rockville, apparently had gotten into trouble in school and was
arguing with his mother about the problem when the shooting occurred.
   The shooting was reported by the boy's father, James T. Nupp, a
medical researcher who arrived home shortly after his wife was shot.
Police spokesman Harry Geehreng said the son opened fire on his
father, who managed to telephone police.
   James Nupp was taken to an area hospital where he suffered one
gunshot wound to the neck, another to the chest and was grazed by a
third bullet. He remained in fair condition Saturday.
   Matthew later surrendered to police who surrounded the home. The
boy's 7-year-old brother fled the house unharmed, and an
unidentified 3-year-old also was not harmed.

   Angola, Cuba and South Africa
on Saturday reaffirmed their commitment to a regional peace treaty
and promised not to let the actions of two guerrilla groups endanger
the pact, a news agency reported.
   The countries wrapped up three days of talks in Luanda, Angola,
that were held to discuss developments since the peace agreement was
signed in New York in December.
   Under the U.S.-mediated treaty, Cuba has agreed to a phased
withdrawal of its 50,000 soldiers in Angola, who support the Marxist
government in its war against the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola guerrilla movement.
   In return, South Africa pledged to halt aid to the rebel group
and grant independence to Namibia, also known as South-West Africa.
   Angola has alleged that South African soldiers entered its
territory two weeks ago in support of the rebels. South Africa has
denied the allegation.
   Meanwhile, South Africa says Angola has allowed guerrillas of the
South-West Africa People's Organization to maintain bases in
southern Angola near the Namibian border. That group is supposed to
move its military bases northward under the agreement.
   The organization has been fighting for independence in Namibia
since 1966 and is the favorite in elections scheduled for later this
year.
   Angola agreed to use its influence with Namibian rebels, and
South Africa pledged to do likewise with the Angolan insurgents in
order to ensure the peace agreement, the independent South African
Press Association reported from Luanda.
   In a joint statement at the end of Saturday's meeting, South
Africa, Angola and Cuba ``reaffirmed once again their commitment to
comply strictly with the agreement,'' the news agency said.
   Neither guerrilla movement was included in the peace agreement,
although the South-West Africa People's Organization has announced a
cease-fire. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
has continued its 13-year-old war against the Angolan government.
   The next meeting between the three countries will be held in Cuba
in March.

<HEAD>Irish Prime Minister Issues New Call for North-South Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey on Saturday
renewed his call for talks with Northern Ireland's Protestant
leaders but reaffirmed the government's commitment to the
Anglo-Irish accord they oppose.
   Haughey, whose earlier appeals for discussions with Northern
Ireland have been rejected by Protestant leaders, said he believed
that such talks would be a step toward peace in Northern Ireland.
   Sectarian violence between Roman Catholics and Protestants in the
British province has cost 2,722 lives in the past 20 years _ 93 of
them in 1988 and 11 this year.
   Speaking at the annual conference of his Fianna Fail party in
Dublin, Haughey said: ``I believe the political circumstances are
opportune at present for such a meeting.
   ``The dialogue that I have in mind need not involve any
commitments,'' he said. ``Nothing need be prejudged, nothing ruled
out.''
   ``This would be the clearest possible signal to all that there
was some possibility, however tenuous, of progress out of the
present horror. If such a development could bring us even one step
forward, one step away from violence as I sincerely believe it
would, then it is difficult to see how the Unionist leadership can
be morally justified in refusing the invitation I now again extend
to them.''
   Haughey made it clear there was no prospect of scrapping the
Anglo-Irish agreement that gives the largely Catholic republic a say
in the affairs of the predominantly Protestant province.
   Rejection of the accord is the main condition set by the hardline
Protestants for any dialogue.
   In a reference to the continuing tension with Britain over
extradition of suspected terrorists, Haughey underlined offical
determination to ensure that the rights of Irish citizens wanted
abroad for any offense would be fully safeguarded.
   Earlier, supporters of Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's
political wing, mounted an anti-extradition protest outside the
conference. The mainly Catholic IRA seeks to drive the British out
of Northern Ireland.

<HEAD>Detroit Archbishop Decries City Council's Hearing On Closings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City Council is violating the principle of
church-state separation by scheduling a public hearing on the
Archdiocese of Detroit's plans to close 30 churches in the city,
Cardinal Edmund Szoka said.
   The March 9 hearing also ``raises questions of anti-Catholicism,
as no other religious denomination has ever been the subject of a
City Council hearing,'' the archdiocese said Friday in a statement.
   Council members denied Szoka's charges and said they scheduled
the hearing to determine the effect of the planned closings on
Detroit neighborhoods.
   ``I think it's terrible to say we're anti-Catholic just because
we're concerned about the departure of community resources and
community services,'' said Councilwoman Maryann Mahaffey, who
sponsored the resolution calling for the hearing.
   ``We're not saying they're wrong,'' she said. ``But when an
organization leaves and their services close down, the question is:
What thought are they giving as to who's going to meet the need when
they go? Who's going to pick up the pieces?''
   Archdiocesan officials will not participate in the hearing, and
Szoka has asked the council to rescind the resolution, spokesman Jay
Berman said. Jews, Lutherans and Methodists have closed more
sanctuaries in Detroit over the years than has the archdiocese, he
added.
   ``None of those faiths were singled out for a hearing,'' Berman
said. ``And when you are singled out, that question (of
anti-Catholicism) just has to be one of the questions asked.''
   Szoka announced Jan. 8 that the archdiocese would close 30
churches because of low membership, aging buildings, low income and
a shortage of priests. Those churches were scheduled to close by
June 30, although some have said they might appeal to the Vatican.
   The Rev. Norman Thomas, pastor of Sacred Heart Church in Detroit
and an opponent of the closings, said the archdiocese's reaction
indicated Szoka had prejudged the hearing.
   ``I think it shows the defensiveness of the cardinal to the whole
question of church closings,'' Thomas said. ``Why wouldn't they send
people to the hearing if they think (the closings) are such a good
idea?''

<HEAD>Gusting Winds Cause Damage Across the Nation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Powerful winds pounded Spain on Saturday,
downing power lines, damaging crops, delaying air travel and forcing
fishing ships back to port, officials said.
   High winds gusting up to 80 mph knocked down trees and power
lines and stirred up waves as high as 33 feet off the northwestern
coast.
   Spaniards were grateful, however, for the needed rain that the
front brought to the northern half of the country.
   For three months the region has suffered an almost complete lack
of rain, provoking the worst drought in the north in 30 years,
according to the National Meterological Institute.
   The institute forecast continued high winds across the country
for Sunday, more rain across the northern half and snow in most
mountainous areas.
   Civil aviation authorities concerned with gusting winds closed
down airports in the northwestern cities of Santiago de Compostela
and Oviedo and in Bilbao and San Sebastian, causing airliners to
delay numerous flights, officials said.
   Gusting winds late Friday caused minor damage to a radar unit at
Madrid's Barajas airport. On Saturday, 50-mph winds at Barajas
delayed numerous flights, an airport official said.
   Civil Defense officials ordered fishing fleets tied up in harbors
along the northern coast and down the southeastern Mediterranean
coast due to heavy seas and high waves.
   In the vegetable-growing province of Almeria the wind caused an
unspecified amount of damage to winter crops grown under plastic.

   An officer convicted in the death of a
Marine corporal who was abandoned in the Mojave Desert last August
was sentenced Saturday to four months in the brig and dismissal from
the Marine Corps.
   Eight officers deliberated about two hours before recommending
the sentence for 1st Lt. Allen Lawson. In deliberations that ended
about midnight Friday, the same jury convicted Lawson of dereliction
of duty and an unrelated charge of appearing drunk in public in
December.
   The jury found Lawson innocent of a more serious charge of
willfully disobeying an order to post road guides in pairs and to
submit a list of the guides to the officer charged with picking up
the Marines. He was the only commissioned officer charged in the
case, but two sergeants were convicted earlier.
   The verdict is subject to review by Maj. Gen. O.K. Steele, the
division commander who convened the court-martial, and automatic
appeal to the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review in
Washington. Lawson has the right to waive the automatic appeal after
Steele's review.
   Lance Cpl. Jason Rother, 19, of Minneapolis was posted as a road
guide during night maneuvers at the Marine base in Twentynine Palms,
Calif., last August. Testimony showed that Lawson, the officer in
charge of posting the guides, posted Rother about 200 yards away
from his partner, when the guides were supposed to be posted in
pairs.
   When the maneuvers ended, Rother was overlooked by a truck convoy
and accidentally left behind in the desert, and was not reported
missing for nearly two days. Searchers found his equipment and an
arrow made of stones at his post, but his remains were not found
until Dec. 4.
   Lawson, 25, of Flint, Mich., showed no emotion as the sentence
was read in the nearly deserted courtroom.
   In a statement to the court before the sentencing, Lawson said if
he was dismissed from the Corps, ``I would hope first to resolve my
alcohol problem.''
   There was no testimony that Rother's death was related to
Lawson's drinking, but court records indicate Lawson has been
convicted four times of driving while intoxicated. Marine Corps
records show Lawson tried to resign from the Corps in July 1988
after one such conviction. He also tried to resign in October and
again this month when charges were brought against him.
   Prosecutors had asked that he be given six months in the brig
before his dismissal.
   In final arguments Friday, defense attorney John Sparks said
others were to blame for the failure to pick up Rother from his
guide duties.
   ``Why are all the fingers pointing to Lawson?'' Sparks said.
   ``What we have to do is stop shooting the survivors,'' he said.
   Before the verdict was reached, Lawson said that the
court-martial was politically motivated. He wrote in a three-page
statement given to reporters Friday that he was angry, confused and
frustrated.
   Several officers in Rother's battalion were reassigned after a
Marine investigation of the incident, and two sergeants who were
Rother's immediate superiors were convicted by a court-martial and
reduced in rank.
   ``For political reasons, those officers, very senior in the chain
of command, have decided to make scapegoats of the officers and men
of the Third battalion, Second Marines,'' Lawson wrote.

   Police reacted with shock at the arrest of a
sheriff's deputy for investigation of murder in the shootings of
three prostitutes, citing his reputation and outstanding record in
18 years on the force.
   ``He's a great guy, a great police officer, and we're just
shocked,'' said police Sgt. Walt Burke, who has known Deputy Rickey
Ross for about six years. ``This is so out of character, so
inconsistent with the Rickey I've known. It's so bizarre. I can't
fathom it.''
   ``Everybody is absolutely astounded,'' said Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Capt. Bob Wilber, Ross' supervisor. ``I've talked to
numerous officers and supervisors, and everybody has acted with
disbelief to this, including myself.''
   Ross, 40, a narcotics officer, was arrested after officers on
routine patrol spotted him early Thursday, erratically driving an
unmarked county car in south-central Los Angeles, an area plagued by
prostitution and gang warfare.
   After he was pulled over, Ross was found sitting with an alleged
prostitute, who told police they were smoking crack cocaine, police
said. In the trunk of the car was a gun that police said was linked
by ballistics tests to the 1988 deaths of three prostitutes.
   The district attorney's office was reviewing the evidence on Ross
and a decision on charges will be made Monday, said spokesman Andy
Reynolds.
   Ross was in jail Saturday and no bail was set.
   Although Ross was arrested for investigation of three killings,
published reports have said police are investigating as many as 12
deaths of the area's ``strawberries,'' the street name for
prostitutes who sell sex for drugs.
   Sheriff Sherman Block said Ross, who is married and has two
children, had been assigned to a narcotics unit at Los Angeles
International Airport. Files show that no serious discipline had
been taken against him in nearly two decades on the force.
   ``He has a very fine record,'' Block said. ``He has been a very
effective investigator in the narcotics bureau.''
   Ross and his family live in a $255,000 Spanish-style home in the
San Bernardino County suburb of Rialto, 50 miles east of Los Angeles.
   ``He's a nice guy,'' said James Crawford, 47, a Compton
firefighter and neighbor of Ross. ``He's a churchgoing family man I
would speak with him across his driveway, on weekends mostly. He was
a friendly guy.''

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Fredrick Axel Schiotz, the
first president of the American Lutheran Church, died Saturday. He
was 87.
   Since retiring as head of the 2.5 million-member denomination in
1971, Schiotz had taught at seminaries and colleges and carried out
special tasks for the ALC and Lutheran World Relief.
   He died at Marti Luther Manor, a nursing home. No cause of death
was made public.
   Schiotz, a native of Chicago, was elected president of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1954. He worked in merger
negotiations that led to the formation in 1960 of the ALC and was
elected to a six-year term as its first president. He was re-elected
in 1966.
   The ALC, based in Minneapolis, merged with the Lutheran Church in
America and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches in 1987
to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which has its
headquarters in Chicago.
   Schiotz, who earned a master's degree in sacred theology from
Luther Seminary in 1932, served from 1938 to 1945 as executive
director of the Student Service Commission of the ALC. He was a
pastor in New York City for three years and then became executive
secretary of the National Lutheran Council's Commission on Younger
Churches and Orphaned Missions.
   Schiotz helped organize the Lutheran World Federation at Lund,
Sweden, in 1947 and was elected its president in 1963 at Helsinki,
Finland. He filled that post through 1970 and continued as a member
of the federation's executive committee.
   In addition, Schiotz served on the executive committee of the
Lutheran Council in the United States and was a member of the
Central Committee of the World Council of Churches.
   Survivors include his wife, Dagny Aasen, two sons and a daughter.

   The United Nations will send ``a small
avalanche'' of food to thousands of starving Sudanese before rains
cut off supply routes, the director of UNICEF said Saturday.
   ``Millions of people are at risk in Sudan,'' which is ravaged by
civil war, drought and crop failures, James P. Grant, the head of
the U.N. Children's Fund told The Associated Press.
   ``One could certainly say that over 100,000 people will live or
die; it depends on getting supplies pre-positioned in southern and
central Sudan before the rains come and even planes are grounded''
in May through November, Grant said.
   ``It's really an unprecedented effort on this scale, to be done
in such a short time frame under such difficult conditions,'' he
said.
   Grant and other U.N. relief officials met at U.N. Headquarters
Saturday, where they decided an airlift of 80,000 tons of food was
required to fend off mass starvation among 4 million Sudanese.
   ``...We have some very hopeful auguries of increasing the modest
stocks of supplies into a small avalanche,'' said Grant.
   On March 8-9, Grant will lead a relief planning meeting of U.N.
and private aid agencies in Khartoum at the invitation of Sudan's
government.
   No figure was available for the cost of the airlift and other
elements of the relief campaign, but in November the cost of meeting
the most urgent needs was estimated at $72.2 million, Grant said.
   Relief operations in Sudan have been crippled by the civil war
between the predominantly Moslem government in the north and a
rebellion in the Christian and animist south by the Sudan People's
Liberation Army.
   Both the government and the rebels have sometimes blocked
supplies from reaching areas held by the other side.
   Last week Sudan's military forces told Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi
to reform his government and seek peace with the rebels or resign.
   ``If there was an agreement on a cease-fire and talks between the
parties, this would clearly ease the situation,'' Grant said. But he
said government upheaval could hinder the delivery of aid.

<HEAD>Pittsburgh Suburb Runs Out of Money to Pay Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>McKEESPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of this Pittsburgh suburb said
nearly half of the 50-member police force would lose their jobs
Sunday despite a community effort to raise $90,000 to pay their
salaries.
   Donations may allow officials to call back several officers, but
only for a short time, Mayor Louis Washowich said Friday.
   Washowich has said he will lay off 21 officers because the city
can't afford 4 to 4{ percent wage increases recently awarded to the
department by state arbitrators.
   The city's volunteer ambulance company began a fund-raising
effort Thursday with a $15,000 gift, and residents added about $300
through countertop donation cans.
   A restaurant planned to contribute Sunday's proceeds, or $5,000
to $7,000, Eat 'n Park manager Fred Balistreri said Friday.
   Equibank employees planned to canvass McKeesport for donations,
and the company promised to match money raised during the coming
week, up to $50,000.
   Some McKeesport churches will take up special donations for the
police or allow solicitations for donations outside their buildings,
said Walt Patterson, chief of operations for the McKeesport
Emergency Medical Services. He said he believed the $90,000 could be
raised by Friday.
   Washowich estimated that figure as the savings to the city of
laying off 24 officers for three months. But he said the
fund-raising was not a long-term solution because wage increases and
benefits for the police will cost $110,000 to $120,000 this year and
$225,000 next year.
   Police officer Patrick Carloss, who is among those facing
layoffs, said the $15,000 alone would be enough to keep officers
working for another two weeks.
   He said he was surprised and angered by the mayor's decision to
proceed with layoffs as planned.
   ``It's a total slap in the face of the citizens of McKeesport,''
said Carloss, who has represented police in contract negotiations.
``These people are going out of their way to save the police.''
   He also said he believes Washowich wants to punish the police for
going to arbitration. Washowich, however, said he based his decision
solely on the need to balance the city's budget.

<HEAD>Monarch Says Bush Understands Mideast Better Than Reagan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Jordan's King Hussein said Saturday that
President George Bush probably understands the Middle East better
than Ronald Reagan and would be more likely to personally engage in
the search for peace in the region.
   Hussein also said he hoped the United States would not let too
much time elapse before getting involved in the stalled peace
process, because the ``situation is very, very volatile.'' He spoke
in a television interview on Cable News Network.
   Hussein, who met with President George Bush in Tokyo on Friday,
said he hoped the Middle East problem would get the ``attention that
it deserves'' by the new Bush administration.
   ``The difference, I would say, is that President Reagan probably
had other priorities, and I don't think he was personally engaged in
the Middle East problem or with any of the attempts to resolve the
problem there,'' Hussein said.
   Reagan offered his own 1982 peace proposal for the region, which
called for a Palestinian state to be confederated with Jordan, but
was turned down by Israel and the Arabs.
   Reagan's Secretary of State, George Shultz, traveled to the
region numerous times but was unable to bring the sides to the
negotiating table.
   ``I have a feeling that President Bush knows the area and knows
how volatile and how dangerous it is,'' Hussein said.
   The urgency arises from the violent 14-month Palestinian uprising
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which has resulted in more than
300 Arab deaths. He also wants the United States to move faster on
its recently begun dialogue with the Palestine Liberation
Organization and to include the group in peace talks.
   Bush said at a Tokyo news conference on Saturday that recent
developments in the Middle East had created opportunities for
dialogue, but he said the United States would not take any action
until it had studied the problem thoroughly and talked to all the
players.
   ``I can understand that they would like to be in touch with all
the parties to the conflict before they move,'' Hussein said. ``But
I hope that this wouldn't take too long a period of time.''
   The King said the United States should begin consultations with
the other four permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council _ the Soviet Union, England, France and China _ on convening
an international peace conference later this year.
   Such a conference would serve as an umbrella for direct
Arab-Israeli peace talks, including the Palestine Liberation
Organization, and the superpowers would not be allowed to veto or
impose solutions, Hussein said.
   Secretary of State James Baker has said the United States might
be willing to consider an international conference but only if it
leads to direct Arab-Israeli talks and does not interfere.
   The Soviets, who have become much more involved in the Middle
East in recent months, support an international conference. Israel
has generally rejected the idea although there have been indications
it might compromise under certain circumstances.
   Bush will have a chance for detailed discussions on the matter
when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir visits here in April.

   The wife of Czechoslovakia's leading
dissident said in an interview broadcast Saturday that her husband
has fallen ill and may not be receiving adequate medical attention
in prison.
   The dissident, playwright Vaclav Havel, was sentenced Tuesday to
nine months in prison after being convicted of inciting citizens to
take part in a banned demonstration and obstructing police officers.
   His wife, Olga Havel, told Austrian radio she has not been
allowed to talk with her husband since he was detained in Prague
five weeks ago.
   His arrest caused widespread protests in Czechoslovakia. East
bloc and Western nations, including the United States, called for
his release.
   ``He is suffering from a series of health problems, and I deeply
fear for his health,'' Mrs. Havel said in the interview. ``In prison
they give only cold water, and there is no regular medical care.''
   She did not describe the ailments of Havel, 52, who had spent a
total of four years in jail for his activism before his latest
arrest.
   Mrs. Havel said no evidence was presented in court that her
husband incited people or ignored appeals to end the demonstration
in Prague's Wenceslas Square. ``The sentence was a political
decision,'' she said.
   Prosecutor Karel Florian had demanded a one-year sentence for
Havel and a $2,500 fine. The presiding judge gave the dissident a
nine-month sentence, which Havel instantly appealed. No fine was
imposed.
   Havel defiantly declared during his trial that he was not guilty
of inciting people to attend a Jan. 15 commemoration for Jan Palach,
a student who burned himself to death 20 years ago to protest the
1968 Soviet-led invasion that ended reforms of Communist Party chief
Alexander Dubcek.
   In Warsaw, Poland, meanwhile, Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski and leading opposition activists both attended the opening
of two of Havel's plays.
   Adam Michnik, a historian and leading Polish political theorist
who has spent years in jail for his writings, jumped on the stage
after the performance and appealed to Czech authorities to release
Havel.
   Michnik called on the ``competent authorities (in Czechoslovakia)
to stop repression'' and urged the Czech leadership to ``take the
same road as other East European countries are taking _
reconciliation with the nation.''
   Rakowski stood throughout most of Michnik's speech and then
quietly left the theater. Most of the 500 people who were in
attendance stood and applauded Michnik's appeal.
   The Powszechny Theater was packed for the performance of
``Audience'' and ``Protest,'' two one-act plays that examine the
choices ordinary people face when confronting authorities in
totalitarian countries.
   In a related development Saturday, 25O young people called for
the release of political prisoners at the first joint meeting of the
Independent Peace Association and the official Czechoslovak
Socialist Youth Union.
   Participants said they observed a minute of silence in Palach's
memory.
   The Independent Peace Association was set up last year,
advocating the establishment of alternatives to military service in
Czechoslovakia and protesting violations of human rights.
   Founding member Jana Petrova was sentenced to nine months' jail
on charges of hooliganism Wednesday, a day after Havel was sentenced.
   Tomas Tvaroch, another group member, told the meeting two
separate petitions have been circulated around Prague to collect
signatures for courts where Havel and Petrova will have their
sentences appealed at an unspecified date, sources said.

   Edward Stephen Pohl said he doesn't believe
he has extrasensory perception _ even if his initials are ESP _ but
he had enough foresight to play the lottery and won $7 million, his
second big lottery haul.
   Several years ago, the truck driver plunked down $5 on 3227 in a
Pennsylvania Lottery game, and he walked away with $25,000.
   Then, on Jan. 13, his 61st birthday and a Friday, Pohl had a
lucky hunch.
   ``I had this feeling I was going to hit the lottery,'' Pohl
recalled last week. ``I told my wife we were going to hit this week.
So I bought $30 worth of tickets'' for the Super Seven drawing of
Jan. 18.
   The Pohl magic had come through again. This time it was worth
$7.158 million.
   ``It's nice for me because I'm going to retire and it will be
good for my kids,'' he said. ``This just goes to show you that
Friday the 13th isn't so unlucky after all.''

<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie, in hiding because of death threats
from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, hints at a feeling of kinship with
another ``vilified'' novelist in a review Sunday of Philip Roth's
autobiography.
   Rushdie, fulfilling his first literary commitment since Khomeini
declared him sentenced to death on Feb. 14, refers to his own
predicament in discussing criticism by Jews of Roth's 1959 novel,
``Goodbye, Columbus.''
   ``I was able to recognize in myself the curious lethargy, the
soporific torpor, that overcomes Roth while he is under attack; to
recognize, too, the stupid, humiliated rage that leads him to cry:
`I'll never write about Jews again,''' Rushdie wrote in The
Observer, a London weekly.
   Roth, he wrote, ``seems to speak directly, profoundly, not only
to, but for, me.''
   Rushdie, 41, an Indian-born Briton, has been called a blasphemer
by Iran's revolutionary patriarch for what he wrote in ``The Satanic
Verses'' about the Prophet Mohammed and the Koran, the Moslem holy
book.
   Roth, an American Jew, came under bitter criticism for his
portrayals of Jewish life and thinking, and responds to his Jewish
critics in his autobiography, ``The Facts.''
   ``His responses to being so vilified have been _ if I may be
forgiven a personal note _ very moving, even helpful, to this
similarly beleaguered writer,'' Rushdie wrote.
   The Observer quoted Roth as saying he did not have to ``face up
to anything remotely like the menace that now engulfs'' Rushdie but
that if Rushdie, ``in his duress, has been able to find some
strength in reading about my own apprenticeship in the unforseen
consequences of art, I'm both touched and pleased.''
   In last week's issue of The Observer, literary editor Blake
Morrison wrote that Rushdie had telephoned him on the day he went
into hiding and assured him he would fulfill his commitment to
review the book.
   Rushdie's review arrived by mail at the newspaper on Tuesday, a
week late, Morrison said, and Rushdie telephoned again to make sure
it had reached its destination.
   ``I didn't ask, and don't know, where he was phoning from,''
Morrison wrote Sunday. ``I would guess from his voice that he is
bearing up well, but I must respect his wish that the conversation
we had remain private.''
   News reports say Rushdie and his American-born wife, novelist
Marianne Wiggins, are being guarded by police at an undisclosed
location.

   With few exceptions, the nation's governors are
respecting President Bush's ``no new taxes'' pledge and holding off
on calls for raising revenue to reduce the federal deficit.
   ``I don't see how he can abandon his `read my lips' promise this
early in his term,'' said Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, chairman of
the Democratic Governors Association.
   ``He's so committed on that (resisting new taxes), it would
destroy his credibility as president,'' said Democratic Gov. Rudy
Perpich of Minnesota.
   An Associated Press survey of governors as they prepared for
their annual midwinter Washington meeting, which began Saturday,
also found most state executives urging the new president to use his
office to promote higher educational standards and innovation.
   That kind of leadership rather than massive increases in federal
funds was cited as the best way for Bush to achieve his goal of
becoming the ``education president.''
   ``I think the main thing the president of the United States
should do is to highlight education and make it the issue,'' said
Republican Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey. ``He's got the bully
pulpit. We want to know, all of us, that education is (at) the top
of the national agenda.''
   The governors were asked if they thought proposals to raise
federal revenue should be on the table when the White House and
Congress try to reach an agreement on how to reduce the federal
deficit.
   They also were asked how they would advise Bush to fulfill his
vow to be the ``education president.''
   During President Reagan's first term, governors often were in the
forefront of those urging the White House to consider new revenues
to deal with growing budget shortfalls. But Reagan held the line and
the governors dropped their appeals for tax increases during his
second term.
   Only a handful of governors urged Bush to consider new revenues.
   Among them was Democrat Steve Cowper of Alaska, who said,
``Otherwise we can't ever get the budget balanced.''
   Democrat Richard Celeste of Ohio said new revenues ought to be on
the table ``but only if the president puts them there.''
   Democrat Mario Cuomo of New York canceled his trip to the NGA
meeting because of a dispute with South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, a Republican, over how to deal with the federal deficit.
   Cuomo and Campbell head an NGA task force on the federal budget
and were to have presented a proposal to their fellow governors on
the deficit. That came apart last week when Campbell objected to
Cuomo's talk about a ``trigger-tax'' provision that would be
included in the proposal.
   Cuomo spokesman Gary Fryer said a deficit reduction plan probably
would be presented to the governors at their May meeting in Chicago.
   One Republican, Gov. Edward D. DiPrete of Rhode Island, predicted
Bush would find a way to back away from his pledge of no new taxes.
   ``I don't say Bush is going to lead the charge for a tax
increase, but sooner or later, some innocuous study (recommending a
tax increase) is going to come from someplace,'' he said.
``Probably, President Bush is going to say, `I don't like it, but if
that's what everybody else thinks, I won't stand in your way.'''
   Other Republicans stood firmly behind the president.
   ``There's no point in putting any new taxes on the table,'' said
Kean.
   ``I think he's taking the rght attitude,'' said Republican Gov.
Bob Martinez of Florida. ``He's going there without any tax thoughts
of revenue enhancement.''
   ``President Bush clearly feels that increased taxes are not
needed to reduce the federal deficit,'' said Republican Gov. Stan
Stephens of Montana. ``We support him in that position and encourage
Congress to look at the spending side and improved government
efficiency.''
   ``I don't think tax increases are the answer,'' said Republican
Gov. Michael Castle of Delaware. ``I think the time has come in this
country for Congress and the White House to stop talking about hard
decisions and start making some.''
   Gov. James Thompson of Illinois, a Republican who is the senior
governor in terms of length of service, said that while federal
funds for school meals and to help disadvantaged children are
important ``even more important is for the president to rally the
nation to a call for a better-educated youth who must compete in the
modern world with other nations.''
   Democrat Booth Gardner of Washington said the states and federal
government ``must build a new partnership that will make early
childhood education and development a national priority.''
   Gardner said he supported administration efforts to encourage
community service and ``I am also urging the Bush administration to
allow greater flexibility in regulations which will allow our
teachers and schools to be more creative and innovative.''
   Democratic Gov. Mike Sullivan of Wyoming was skeptical about what
Bush could do for education ``given the very pressing budget issues
facing us. Certainly, our efforts to cut the budget deficit will be
integrally related to our efforts to improve education, at least as
far as spending goes.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, whom Bush defeated for the
presidency, cited three propoals he had made during that campaign: a
teaching excellence fund to help young people studying to become
teachers; field centers to encourage teachers to sharpen their
skills, and a federally backed college loan program.
   Republican Terry Branstad of Iowa urged Bush to ``convene a
national conference on educational excellence and to provide
additional support for students' access to higher education.''

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ted Warmbold, editor of the San Antonio Light,
died Saturday after a 10-day illness at the age of 45.
   Warmbold, who formerly held executive titles with newspapers in
Rochester, N.Y., San Bernardino, Calif., Dallas and Los Angeles, had
been the chief news executive at the Light since joining the
newspaper in June 1981.
   ``Ted was the most talented editor I have had the privilege of
working with during my almost 25 years in the newspaper business,''
said publisher George B. Irish. ``Ted's death leaves a giant void in
our lives and in the lives of thousands of San Antonians who were
touched by his caring and generosity.''
   The newspaper said Warmbold died at Humana Metropolitan Hospital
after a bout with cryptococcal meningitis.
   The disease is an opportunistic infection in people whose immune
system is weakened, including victims of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, or patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy or bone
marrow transmplants, said Dr. Ron Kennedy, a researcher at the
Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research.
   A native of St. Louis, Warmbold attended various seminary schools
before transferring to the University of Missouri School of
Journalism, where he received his degree and met his wife, Carolyn,
a former newspaper editor and now a doctoral candidate at the
University of Texas at Austin.
   They married in January 1967 and they immediately began their
careers as reporters with the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, a
Gannett newspaper.
   In 1969, Warmbold was named assistant managing editor at the
Democrat and Chronicle and in 1972, Gannett named him managing
editor of the San Bernardino Sun-Telegram.
   He left Gannett in 1975 and became assistant managing editor of
the Dallas Times Herald and the following year became executive
editor of D magazine, the city magazine of Dallas and Fort Worth.
   In 1977, The Hearst Corp. hired him as executive editor of the
Los Angeles Herald Examiner and in 1981, Hearst named him executive
editor at the Light. He was promoted to editor in 1986.
   He is survived by his wife, his mother, three sisters and two
brothers.
   A funeral Mass will be celebrated Monday at San Fernando
Cathedral in San Antonio. Burial will be in St. Louis.

<HEAD>Journalists, Opposition Politicians Protest Meida Closures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of journalists and opposition
politicians gathered Saturday in front of the closed newspaper La
Prensa to protest the government's suppression of the media.
   ``The closure of the communications media has created the
awareness that where there is no freedom of expression there is no
liberty,'' said Migdalia Fuentes de Pineda, interim president of the
Journalists' Union. The organization is not recognized by the
government.
   About 1,000 people lost their jobs when the government shut down
three newspapers, three radio stations and a television channel last
year.
   The government crackdown came shortly after the Legislative
Assembly dismissed President Eric Delvalle on Feb. 26. Delvalle was
ousted because he had tried to fire Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
head of the nation's security forces and the nation's de-facto ruler.
   Manuel Solis Palma, who had served as education minister,
replaced Delvalle.
   Still recognized by the U.S. government as Panama's head of
state, Delvalle remains in hiding in Panama. He tried to fire
Noriega because the general was accused of involvement in drug
trafficking by a Florida grand jury.
   Since then, the U.S. government has applied enormous financial
pressure on Panama to try to force Noriega's removal.
   The three newspapers, El Siglo, La Prensa and Extra, as well as
the three radio stations, oppose Noriega; Delvalle owns the
television station.
   Alfredo Jimenez, director of information at La Prensa, said the
future of these media is uncertain. ``Maybe they will open tomorrow
or maybe never,'' he told The Associated Press.
   Hundreds of people showed up for the protest, most of them
members of political opposition parties and journalists.
   Justice Minister Rodolfo Chiari said recently that the attorney
general is looking into whether to allow the media to reopen. The
attorney general's office has indicated that the media are accused
of libeling Panama's national character.
   Panama recently toughened requirements for foreign
correspondents, requiring a $50 fee and journalists' credentials
certified by the Panamanian consulate in his country.

   A Middle Eastern diplomat said Saturday pro-Iranian
Moslems were receiving terrorist training in at least five places in
England, so authorities should take seriously Iran's death threat
against novelist Salman Rushdie.
   The senior diplomat in London told The Associated Press that
Islamic cultural centers in Bradford, Leicester and Manchester and
at least two in London were bases for Iranian and Lebanese members
of Hezbollah, or Party of God, a pro-Iranian extremist group.
   Hezbollah members are training British-based Moslems to use
weapons and make bombs, said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said Britain's MI5 counter-espionage organization and Scotland
Yard's anti-terrorist unit were aware of the terrorist training.
Scotland Yard would not comment.
   Rushdie, born into a Moslem family in India, is a British citizen
and lives in London. He has been in hiding since Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini told Moslem zealots on Feb. 14 he should
die for his book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Many Moslems believe ``The Satanic Verses'' insults Islam.
   In Lebanon on Saturday, the leader of a group allied with
Hezbollah called on Moslems in Britain to kill the 41-year-old
author.
   Hussein Musawi, head of Islamic Amal, told Shiite Moslems in the
city of Baalbek: ``We have to take the initiative and speed up
taking part in Rushdie's execution.''
   Iran's president, Ali Khameini, reasserted his country's
intention to punish Rushdie.
   Speaking to reporters in Bucharest, Romania, where he ended an
official visit Saturday, Khameini said, ``One man ... allowed
himself to insult the deepest feelings of millions of Moslims in the
name of freedom.''
   ``This is no longer freedom of thought but a crime, and that is
why (Rushdie) has to be punished,'' he said.
   Rushdie apologized Feb. 18 for any distress ``The Satanic
Verses'' had caused, but Khomeini was unmoved. Iranian religious
leaders have put a $5.2 million bounty on his head.
   Rushdie, in his first public comments since going into hiding,
wrote in a book review published Sunday that he felt a sense of
kinship with novelist Philip Roth, who was criticized by Jews for
his 1959 novel, ``Goodbye, Columbus.''
   Reviewing Roth's autobiography, ``The Facts,'' in The Observer
weekly, Rushdie said: ``I was able to recognize in myself the
curious lethargy, the soporific torpor, that overcomes Roth while he
is under attack; to recognize, too, the stupid, humiliated rage that
leads him to cry: `I'll never write about Jews again,''' Rushdie
wrote in The Observer, a London weekly.
   ``His responses to being so vilified have been _ if I may be
forgiven a personal note _ very moving, even helpful, to this
similarly beleaguered writer,'' Rushdie wrote.
   Iran's official Islamic News Agency reported Saturday that
Khomeini's designated successor, Xasaid Ayatollah Hussein Ali
Montazeri, said Iran's ``firm stance'' showed the strength of the
Islamic republic.
   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, also said Montazeri criticized
Arab governments for remaining silent on the controversy.
   The book has been banned in Egypt and Jordan but has attracted
little comment from government officials.
   Iran has banned the book, as have South Africa, Bangladesh, India
and Pakistan. Maylaysia, where Islam is the official religion,
outlawed the book Saturday.
   Britain last week ordered all its diplomats in Tehran home. The
other 11 nations that belong to the Common Market then announced
they were withdrawing top-ranking diplomats from Iran.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe of Britain said Saturday he
was encouraged by the range of countries that had recalled envoys.
   He noted that Canada, Norway and Sweden had joined the 12-nation
European Economic Community in withdrawing their diplomatic chiefs
from Iran. He also said ``a number of other countries,'' which he
did not name, were joining in the condemnation.
   Howe praised leaders of predominanlty Moslem nations for not
endorsing the death threat and cited Pakistan as an example of a
Moslem country that ``has been prepared to uphold the rule of law
against violent protest.''
   Six people have died in Pakistan in demonstrations against the
book. At least 10 people have died in protests in India, including
nine killed Friday.
   On Saturday, India's governing Congress party denounced
Khomeini's death threat.
   ``We never subscribe to the views expressed by people who want a
terrorist or violent action against an individual,'' the Press Trust
of India news agency quoted party General Secretary K.N. Singh as
saying.

<HEAD>Carousel Art Sets Auction Record</HEAD>

   A new record for carousel art was set Saturday
when a hand-carved rooster sold for $148,500 at auction, Sotheby's
said.
   The sale, which featured elaborately hand-carved wooden horses,
zebras, giraffes, chariots and pigs, fetched a total of $1.3
million, said Diana Levitt, the auction house's director of
corporate affairs.
   ``There were a lot of smiles today,'' she said. ``These pieces
bring back so many childhood and adult memories.''
   The white rooster, replete with a green and black saddle, brought
the highest bid at the sale, Levitt said. The rare carving by
woodcarver Gustav Dentzel dates back to about 1895 and is one of
four known to exist.
   There was applause at the auction when bidders learned a carousel
in Asbury Park, N.J. would not have to be dismantled and sold piece
by piece, the spokeswoman said.
   The owner of the 1895 carousel had wanted to sell it intact for
at least $900,000. But, when there were no bids for the entire
carousel, seven carved horses were sold individually before it was
announced that a group calling itself the Friends of Asbury Park was
intervening to save the carousel.
   The carousel has 68 horses and animals and two chariots.
   She said that buyers of individual horses from the Asbury Park
carousel will be allowed to cancel their purchase, if they choose,
so that the Palace Carousel can remain intact.

   Passengers who survived United Airlines Flight
811 reached their destinations Saturday with vivid tales of being
``scared to death'' as dozens more chose to stay behind in Hawaii.
   ``It was a nightmare and I'm glad I got back on that plane today
because if I'd waited I don't know if I would have ever flown
again,'' said Cathy Mehan, of Washington, D.C., after she arrived in
New Zealand early Saturday.
   The fuselage of a United jumbo jet carrying 354 people ripped
open shortly after takeoff early Friday from Honolulu International
Aiport, and nine people were sucked from the plane 20,000 feet above
the Pacific Ocean.
   The crippled Boeing 747 made an emergency landing with a
10-foot-wide, 40-foot-high section torn from its right side.
   Rochelle Perel, 48, of Beverly Hills, Calif., was just an arms
length away from the gaping hole.
   ``The aircraft (section) was blown away and I noticed the wind,
the stars and the clouds,'' Perel said. ``It was an indication we
weren't going to make it, and it was very scary.''
   Enrique Reyes, 36, survived with ``$250 and the experience of a
lifetime.'' He was supposed to have taken a direct flight home to
Sydney, Australia, when he checked in at Los Angeles.
   The flight was apparently full, and a United employee offered him
$250 if he would take a seat aboard Flight 811, which was departing
later Thursday.
   Reflecting on his $250 bonus, Reyes said, ``It wasn't worth it.''
   Passengers held loved ones and prepared for the worst as the
plane headed back to Honolulu.
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' said Robert Molnar of Sydney,
who was returning from a Hawaiian honeymoon with his wife, Helen.
``I made a comment to my wife that we've only been married for three
weeks. What a way for it to end.''
   Others took snapshots including Beverley Nisbet, of Hastings, New
Zealand, who saw another passenger snapping pictures and decided it
would give her something to do.
   Nisbet thought she had taken only one picture, which looks toward
the front of the passenger cabin and shows the damaged interior. She
doesn't remember taking the second, which shows passengers wearing
life jackets braced against seats. The photographs were distributed
by The Associated Press.
   Paul Grigson of Sydney said passengers in the rear of the
aircraft were unaware of how serious the situation was.
   ``Most people thought it was just a window or something had gone
and they didn't realize how bad it was until they got off the
plane,'' Grigson said.
   ``Scared? Yeah, I was scared. Terrified. More scared now,
though,'' Grigson said.
   United Airlines said 247 of the 336 passengers from Flight 811
boarded a special flight Friday night for New Zealand and Australia.
Those who didn't want to fly right away were put up in hotels.
   Honolulu hospitals treated 27 people, mostly for minor injuries.
Five people remained hospialized Saturday.
   Leanne Devlin, 23, of Sydney, Australia, was among those who
decided to take the first flight home.
   ``I'm a bit jumpy about hopping back on, but there's no other way
to get home,'' Miss Devlin said.
   Early Saturday, 110 passengers from Flight 811 arrived at Aukland
International Airport in New Zealand aboard the special flight.
   Ms. Mehan remembered thinking during the ordeal: ``Am I gonna
make it? Am I gonna die? Am I gonna live? I didn't feel it was my
time to go, but I was just scared to death.''
   ``I'm surprised that we're here. I didn't feel like we were gonna
be here,'' Denise Brady of Denver said after arriving in Aukland.
   She said was ``a little jumpy'' getting back on an airplane.
   ``Everyone watched the safety film intently. Every head was
riveted to it,'' Ms. Brady said.
   Gill Perry of Colorado recalled how jubilant Flight 811's
passengers were when the plane landed in Honolulu.
   ``There was just great relief _ and disbelief,'' he said.
   ``Talking with other people sitting farther up in the plane, I
realize how close we came to dying,'' said John Peryer of Hastings,
New Zealand. ``I'm just thankful I'm back on the ground, but I'm
sorry for the ones that didn't make it.''

   The security demands of the U.S. Secret Service
bewildered and dismayed a Beijing church pastor who conducted a
special Sunday morning church service for President Bush and his
wife, Barbara.
   First the agents wanted to examine several Chinese-language
Bibles and hymnals that the Rev. Kan Xueqing and his fellow
ministers planned to give the Bushes. Then they demanded the church
doors be closed to worshippers more than an hour before the start of
the service.
   The security officials also had initially insisted that church
members not to be told of the service until two days beforehand _
when in a practically telephone-less society, it would be difficult
to get word out.
   The restrictions were modified slightly after Kan expressed
concerns about impingement on local customs.
   Western ministers might have expected such demands. But to the
67-year-old Kan, who most of his career has faced athiest communist
restrictions on worship, the security precautions were
incomprehensible.
   ``It has been very difficult. I was upset,'' Kan said Friday as
White House technicians installed lights and sound equipment in the
86-year-old brick Chongwenmen Protestant Church.
   ``They want to close off all the entrances to the street leading
to our church. The freedom of our believers to come to church to
worship will be restricted,'' he said. After decades of communist
suppression, that is a freedom Chinese Christians don't take
lightly, he said.
   ``I never thought the United States would give us this problem,''
Kan added. ``Maybe atheists would.''
   Kan's church, located in a walled compound down a narrow alley,
is one of six Protestant churches serving the Beijing metropolitan
area. Its single service at 9:30 a.m. each Sunday usually is filled
to capacity with about 1,500 people.
   For the Bushes, the church planned a special, half-hour service
at 8 a.m.
   Kan said he was overjoyed when he learned Bush, a former
parisioner of his, was to come.
   The minister had conducted Sunday services for Beijing's small
foreign community in a former YMCA hall in the early 1970s. Bush and
his wife, Barbara, were regular worshippers during Bush's 1974-75
stint as head of the U.S. Liaison Office before full U.S.-Chinese
diplomatic ties were established.
   ``Some of this is the problem that (Kan) hoped it would be like
the old days when the Bushes rode up on their bicyles,'' said U.S.
Embassy spokesman Sheridan W. Bell. ``But he is president now.''
   During their stay in the 1970s, the Bushes were famous for their
penchant for riding bikes, the favorite Chinese mode of
transportation.
   Kan said he understood the Secret Service's responsibility to
protect Bush. But he added, ``I am a pastor. I am a friend of so
many years. I heard ministers are respected in U.S. society, not
like here, where you say, `I'm a pastor' and people say, `What's
that?'''
   His protests have been heeded. The White House sent him a letter
late this week, he said, assuring him it would respect Chinese
customs.
   The Secret Service backed off on examining the gift books and
agreed to keep the church doors open until half an hour before the
service.
   They also let him announce the service half a day earlier so he
could tell church members who came to a Thursday night prayer
service.
   White House staffers ``are trying to be as sensitive and polite
as they can,'' Bell said.
   Kan said he prayed and decided he should understand the Secret
Service's viewpoint. ``Their thinking and mine are not the same,''
he said. ``They are doing it for Bush.''
   His hope, he said, was that Bush's attendance would stimulate
interest in Christianity in China.
   ``I believe God has arranged a very good opportunity to spread
the Gospel,'' in the officially atheist society, he said.

   Snow and rain fell on drought-stricken Italy on
Saturday, delighting farmers and resort owners who had not seen a
wet weekend in months.
   The precipitation was expected to continue through most of the
week, weather officials said.
   Some regions of Italy have not had rain for 80 days, while others
have had less than half the average for several months. Barely any
snow has fallen since November, prompting closures and tourist
cancellations at ski resorts.
   On Saturday, ski facilities in the Italian Alps reported up to
four feet of snow on the ground following the precipitation that
began Friday. Lighter snow was reported at smaller mountains in
northern Italy.
   Rain fell at lower elevations throughout the peninsula.
   In Venice, where gondolas have been unable to navigate some
canals for lack of water, the rain was heavy enough to prompt fears
of flooding.

<TEXT>
   Three South Korean crewmen on a tanker died from
lack of oxygen while they were working near storage containers
filled with nitrogen gas, the coast guard said Sunday.
   The three were found Saturday inside a cargo tank of the
3,627-ton Panamanian-registered ship Shoko-maru, said a coast guard
duty officer. The ship was berthed at Kashima, northeast of Tokyo.
   The ship, with a crew of 18, arrived at the port earlier Saturday
carrying palm oil, and the accident occurred during unloading of the
oil, said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said some of the ship's storage containers were filled with
nitrogen gas after part of the oil was unloaded from the ship at the
port of Osaka, in western Japan, where the ship visited earlier.
   The officer said nitrogen gas generally is used to replace palm
oil while it is being removed from the storage containers to prevent
the oil from being spoiled by touching the air.
   But he said the storage area where the three Koreans were found
was empty.
   Local police and coast guard officials were investigating the
deaths.

<TEXT>
   The Dallas Cowboys football team was sold
Saturday to an Arkansas millionaire, who immediately replaced Tom
Landry, the team's only coach in its 29-year history.
   Team owner H.R. ``Bum'' Bright sold the Cowboys to Jerry Jones,
46, of Little Rock, Ark. Jones' empire includes two oil and gas
exploration and production companies, Arkoma Exploration Co. and JMC
Exploration Co.
   Jones named his longtime friend, Jimmy Johnson, football coach at
the University of Miami, as head coach of the Cowboys. At Miami,
Johnson won the national championship in 1987.
   The sale price was not disclosed but it had been estimated at
$140 million.
   ``That's between Bum and me, but I don't mind telling you I'm
going to need some lead in my back pocket,'' Jones said at a news
conference. ``I'm going to leave Dallas lighter than when I came
in.''
   The Cowboys finished with a 3-13 record in 1988. Landry's record
with the Cowboys was 250-162-6.
   Landry, 64, set an National Football League record with 20
consecutive winning seasons from 1966 through 1985. He is third on
the NFL's all-time victory list behind George Halas and Don Shula.
   Landry had one year left on his contract at $800,000. He joined
the Cowboys in 1960 and had said he wanted to coach the team into
the next decade. He did not return telephone calls to his home
Saturday.
   The NFL owners must approve the sale to Jones.

   Thousands of American Moslems prayed and burned
effigies of Salman Rushdie in front of his publisher's office
Saturday to demand that his book ``Satanic Verses'' be banned in the
United States.
   ``Rushdie will die soon,'' said a sign carried by a small child,
one of at least 3,000 protesters who marched on a street near the
headquarters of Viking Penguin Inc., the book's U.S. publisher.
   ``Salman Rushdie _ die. How much longer will you hide?'' said
another sign, referring to the protection Great Britain has given
the author, who lives in London, following death threats from
Islamic fundamentalists.
   At a smaller rally in Boston, about 40 people paraded in a circle
on the Common carrying signs reading ``Blasphemy Does Not Equal
Freedom of Speech, Respect for All Religions.''
   Events in two other cities gave both sides the opportunity to be
heard.
   Writers gathered on the steps of the main Atlanta library to
denounce the death threats. U.S. Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., invited a
small group of Moslem protesters to the microphone, saying, ``We
have our disagreements, but we respect your freedom.''
   He said later, however, ``The ayatollah and his fanatical
followers can go to hell.''
   On Los Angeles radio station KPFK-FM, William Schallert and other
actors read excerpts from the novel as part of an hourlong program
that also featured authors discussing free speech issues and experts
on Islam explaining why Moslems have condemned the book.
   Moslems from across the country joined the mid-afternoon rally in
Manhattan, and some carried the flags of Iran, Pakistan and
Bangladesh, all Islamic nations. Demonstrators also carried signs
saying, ``Viking Penguin, we gonna fix you up'' and ``Satanic Verses
Equals Literary Terrorism.''
   Police guarded the publisher's front entrance, watching the
protesters as they listened to the chant ``Allah is great!''
blasting through loudspeakers. No arrests were made, police said.
   ``We support Rushdie's death according to the laws of Islam,''
said Mohammed Muwahid, an engineer who works for the city of New
York and was born in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   ``There's a need to take planned action,'' said Shahid Mahmood, a
Pakistani-born investment broker with Robert W. Baird &amp; Co.
   Mahmood, of Pine Brook, N.J., said American Moslems are planning
a march on Washington D.C. within the next two weeks if Viking
Penguin does not stop publishing and selling Rushdie's book.
   At the Islamic Center of North America in Plainfield, Ind.,
officials said Rushdie's book is an offense on religion in general,
not just Islam.
   Moslems say the book depicts the Islamic prophet Mohammed through
a blasphemous fictional character and names prostitutes after
Mohammed's wives.
   ``It slurs women of virtue that have been used by one billion
people as models of morality, of family organization and kindness,''
said Dawood Zwink, vice president of the Islamic Society of North
America.
   Rushdie has labeled the book as fiction and apologized for the
distress its has caused. But Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini has stood by the $5.2 million bounty offered for Rushdie's
execution.
   President Bush and Western Europe's leaders have condemned the
death threat, and many writers have rallied to support Rushdie's
freedom of expression.

   John Tower is going public with his campaign to
become defense secretary as President Bush vows to go face-to-face
with wavering senators in an effort to win enough Democratic support
to get Tower confirmed.
   Meanwhile, one Republican senator was quoted as saying that if
she were in Tower's position she would ask that the nomination be
withdrawn.
   Tower was booked onto a Sunday morning network television
interview show and is planning a speech, probably Tuesday, at the
National Press Club.
   Bush, meanwhile, told reporters in Tokyo on Saturday that he will
meet individually with 10 or more Democratic senators after he
returns to the White House Monday from a four-day Asian trip.
   ``I'll do it personally and I'll do it as forcefully as I can,''
the president said. ``I will encourage people to look at the facts.''
   Also, Republicans worried about reports Saturday that Senate
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., would reopen the
hearings and subpoena people who had been questioned by the FBI and
whose allegations against Tower had been included in the report,
said congressional sources who requested anonymity.
   Arnold Punaro, a member of the committee staff, said late
Saturday he couldn't comment on the report.
   Punaro said the committee staff did meet Saturday to prepare for
this week's floor debate on the nomination, but the report of
reopening hearings was ``not in that context.''
   Some Tower opponents have said perceptions that he is a drinker
and womanizer and may have conflict of interest problems are valid
reasons to vote against him even if there is no proof of such things.
   ``That's not fair enough and that's not high enough a standard
when it comes to the confirmation of an important nominee of this
nature,'' said Bush. ``So I have made some calls and I will be
talking to whoever remains open minded.''
   In Beijing, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu asserted that
Democrats ``are getting nervous'' about the upcoming Senate vote
Tower and that some of them appeared to be coming around.
   Bush plans to meet with the Senate Democrats at the White House
early on Tuesday. The Senate vote is tenatively scheduled for
Wednesday.
   ``A lot of Democrats are leaning nicely,'' Sununu told reporters.
``You might see some interesting things to try and reconstruct on
the Democratic side.'' He did not elaborate, but added, ``I have the
feeling that the Democrats are getting very nervous.''
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post in Sunday's editions quoted
Republican Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas as saying that if she were
in Tower's position, she would ask that the nomination be withdrawn.
   ``One can have respect for the experience and expertise and still
wonder whether he could effectively serve the president ... It's
something he has to answer,'' the paper quoted Kassebaum as saying.
She said she would withhold her decision on his nomination until she
reads the latest FBI report on Tower.
   Sununu would not say which Democrats had been invited to the 7:15
a.m. White House meeting, but indicated it was more than just a few.
   Among the Democrats who said Friday they have not decided how to
vote when the Tower nomination reaches the Senate floor was Lloyd
Bentsen, a veteran of many close political encounters with both Bush
and Tower in years of Texas politics, and Howell Heflin of Alabama.
   The decision to assign a high-profile role to Tower and have the
president exert the power of private Oval Office meetings is part of
a battle plan worked out with Senate Republican leaders in an effort
to salvage the nomination or, at least, save face for a GOP
president on the job only a month.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas detailed part of the
plan on Friday, hours after members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee dealt Tower, a former colleague and one-time chairman, a
crushing blow.
   The committee voted 11-9 along party lines late Thursday to
recommend that the full Senate reject the Tower nomination.
   ``I cannot in good conscience vote to put an individual at the
top of the chain of command when his history of excessive drinking
is such that he would not be selected to command a missile wing, a
SAC bomber squadron or a Trident missile submarine,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the committee, before other Democrats
echoed his view.
   Nunn also was booked onto a Sunday talk show, one airing in
Washington in a time slot just before the show featuring Tower
begins on a rival network.
   On Friday, Tower met at the White House with Dole and Vice
President Dan Quayle for a strategy session.
   Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, meaning Bush must
pick up at least five Democrats to assure Tower's confirmation. Dole
said he believed all 45 Republicans were behind Tower.
   Meanwhile, in Minneapolis, Quayle said Saturday the Bush
administration is seeking ``five good Democratic senators'' to
salvage Tower's nomination.
   ``Hopefully, we can find five Democratic senators to come forth
and say they not only know John Tower but they feel he is capable
and qualified,'' Quayle told a news conference. He traveled to
Minneapolis to speak at a GOP fundraiser.
   The Bush administration, Quayle said, will not ``throw in the
towel on the John Tower nomination.''
   Dole said the White House is preparing a summary of the
confidential FBI file on Tower that can be released to the public in
hopes of demonstrating that allegations against him are baseless.
   Tower has been dogged by charges of excessive drinking and
womanizing as well as conflict-of-interest questions related to his
lucrative contract work for various defense contractors.
   If the strategy of pressing the Democrats to present solid facts
for a vote against Tower doesn't work, the Republicans will be ready
with the charges of partisanship that marked the Armed Services
Committee session Thursday.
   ``This is going to make it much more difficult to put together a
bipartisan coalition for defense and foreign policy,'' said Sen.
William Cohen, R-Maine.

   Structural failure probably caused a gaping hole

authorities said.
   Although the FBI summoned three bomb experts from Washington to
join in the investigation today, aviation experts said the most
likely cause of the tragedy was metal fatigue, not terrorism.
   The 18-year-old Boeing 747, the oldest in United's jumbo jet
fleet, was about 100 miles south of Honolulu early Friday when a
10-foot-wide, 40-foot-high section of fuselage suddenly ripped away,
exposing the cargo and passenger compartments.
   The nine passengers _ six Americans, two Australians and a New
Zealander _ were instantly blown through the opening, and at least
one was sucked into one of the jet's engines, authorities said.

   The United Air Lines 747 that lost nine
passengers when a cargo door and section of fuselage blew away over
the Pacific Ocean was one of a group of older Boeing jets under
order to modify the lock system on their cargo doors.
   Failure of the door was one of several possibilities
investigators were exploring today as cause for the gaping hole in
United Flight 811 when it returned to Honolulu after taking off on a
flight to Auckland, New Zealand.
   Other possibilities included structural failure, an engine
problem that sent parts flying into the fuselage or a bomb.
   A July 1, 1988, ``airworthiness directive'' from the Federal
Aviation Administration gave airlines with 156 of the early jumbo
jets from 30 to 90 days to conduct inspections and any necessary
repairs, depending on the type of door lock they have. They were
also given from 18 to 24 months to make modifications to improve the
door lock system.
   United public relations officials did not return a call late
Friday to inquire whether the damaged airliner's cargo doors had
been inspected or whether the ordered alteration had been made on
that or other United 747s. The airline would have had at least
another 10 months to make the improvement.

   President Bush will intensify his personal
lobbying efforts on behalf of Defense Secretary-designate John Tower
next week and the embattled nominee will publicly argue his own
cause, White House officials said today.
   The battle plan to salvage Tower's endangered nomination was
revealed to reporters accompanying Bush on a flight from Tokyo to
Beijing, on the second leg of the president's Asian tour. Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater also said Tower would attend a meeting
Tuesday when the president briefs his Cabinet on the five-day
diplomatic mission.
   The plan includes the possible rare public release of material
culled from an FBI report on Tower, although Bush said in Tokyo he
was anxious to protect the confidentiality of the people who agreed
to talk to investigators.
   Fitzwater told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One today
that Tower will publicly campaign for his confirmation in a speech
next week and in television interviews. Bush has already begun
lobbying senators by telephone from abroad.

   Darman told reporters Friday that the administration has a
position on the proper spending level for ``almost every one'' of
the programs in the $136 billion collection of government agencies
for which the administration is seeking savings of $10 billion.
   Democratic critics have charged that the administration purposely
has left the savings in this area of non-defense programs
unspecified so that Congress will have to take the political heat
for cutting popular domestic programs.
   Darman, however, denied this assertion and said that once the
private negotiations with Congress get under way in earnest, the
administration will be willing to state what its position is.

   President Bush visits South Korea on
Monday at a time when anti-American sentiment is growing
dramatically, with many Koreans demanding sweeping changes in
relations with their closest ally.
   During a brief visit, Bush is expected to discuss ways to reduce
friction and to review the friendship. U.S. and South Korean
officials say relations are excellent, but they want to ensure
anti-American sentiment does not threaten their ties.
   Anti-Americanism has mushroomed among groups ranging from radical
students to conservative farmers, all accusing the United States of
exploiting South Korea. Complaints range from claims of military
occupation to unfair trade pressure and cultural insensitivity.
   As South Korea has become stronger in recent years, growing
nationalism and resentment of some U.S. policies have aggravated
anti-American sentiment, analysts say. The United States also has
been singled out as a target by anti-government groups trying to
gain support by whipping up nationalist sentiment, they say.

<HEAD>Bank-Financed Takeovers Facing Tougher Scrutiny By Feds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tightening the choke chain around economic growth
isn't the only way the Federal Reserve is exerting authority. It's
also warning banks to more aggressively monitor their lending for
debt-financed takeovers.
   A spike in the Fed's key discount rate loan fee and its other
anti-inflationary moves this past week came as the nation's central
bank took another important step: The Fed implemented tightened
guidelines for banks, specifying which debt-financed acquisitions
might be too risky for them.
   Under these guidelines, loans to borrowers with debt that is more
than triple their equity are considered ``highly leveraged
financings,'' which means they probably will face increased scrutiny
by federal bank examiners.
   It also means that bank lending in the unprecedented onslaught of
corporate acquisitions financed largely by debt will decline,
takeover experts speculated.
   In addition, the guidelines instruct bankers to carefully assess
their companywide exposure in debt-financed takeovers before
committing to additional loans for such activity.
   Banks increasingly have become important financiers of the
takeover tactic known as the leveraged buyout or LBO, in which a
buyer borrows most of the purchase money for a company and repays it
through the company's earnings, asset sales or a combination of both.
   A 1988 Fed survey suggested that 15 percent of commercial and
industrial loans were related to LBOs and other types of takeovers
and at some big banks the figure was as high as 40 percent.
   One reason banks have plunged into the LBO business is the high
rate of interest they may charge for the loans. The growing risk,
however, is that a substantial portion of these loans could default
if the debt-burdened borrowers face a downturn in their business.
   Fed regulators, sensitive to how many banks recklessly loaned
money to Third World nations and speculative Southwest real estate
ventures in years past, are concerned that the LBO binge is deja vu.
   They also are particularly mindful of the crisis plaguing the
savings and loan industry, which has left many thrifts insolvent due
to risky loans that went bad. The crisis has bankrupted the federal
agency that insures thrifts and could cost more than $100 billion in
government bailout assistance.
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said he was troubled by bank
lending for LBOs late last year after a spree of multibillion dollar
deals was announced, including the record $24.53 billion takeover of
RJR Nabisco Inc.
   While Greenspan did not suggest the government restrict such
takeovers, he said banks carefully should evaluate their involvement
in them.
   Even if U.S. banks cut their exposure to LBO-related loans
because of the new Fed guidelines, some experts believe that won't
deter the pace of debt-financed takeovers. There are many other
alternate sources of financing, including Wall Street investment
firms and foreign banks.
   ``I can understand why the Fed did this but it's misguided,''
said Yakov Amihud, a professor of finance and LBO expert at New York
University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business. ``Bank
participation will decline but others will jump into the void.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Fears of inflation intensified, particularly because of a Labor
Department report that showed consumer prices surged 0.6 percent in
January, the biggest rise in two years. Financial markets slumped
and banks raised their prime lending rate to a four-year high of
11.5 percent.
   _More trouble befell the airline industry. Machinists and
management at money-losing Eastern airlines hurtled toward a March 4
strike, with conflicting signals from pilots over who they would
support. An airborne United Airlines Boeing 747 lost a chunk of
fuselage, sucking out several passengers. Air Canada said two of its
Boeing 767s contained crossed wiring, a defect that federal aviation
officials have called a safety hazard. Counteracting bad news at
Boeing was a $3.15 billion order for new 747s by All Nippon Airways.
   _Textile giant West Point-Pepperell Inc. capitulated in a hostile
takeover fight with underwear maker William Farley, who will buy the
company for nearly $3 billion. Elsewhere, Texas Eastern Corp. agreed
to a $3.22 billion takeover from Panhandle Eastern Corp.; Champion
Spark Plug Co. agreed to an $800 million takeover by Cooper
Industries Inc.; and Emhart Corp. received a $2.2 billion takeover
offer from an investor group that included oil heir Gordon Getty.

<HEAD>Inflation, Interest Rates Jolt Stocks</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest round of bad inflation news and
interest-rate increases caught stock market investors with their
guard down.
   The 0.6 percent rise in the consumer price index for January
reported on Tuesday didn't come without any advance warning.
   After all, figures issued earlier had shown a 1 percent increase
for the same month in the producer price index of finished goods.
   And the Federal Reserve's move Friday to raise its discount rate
from 6.5 percent to 7 percent had been discussed on Wall Street for
months as a likely possibility.
   Indeed, some analysts had thought the Fed might raise the rate
charged on loans to private financial institutions to 7.5 percent.
   Yet stocks sold off sharply on both developments in Wall Street's
rockiest week so far in 1989.
   The problem, analysts said, was that the news hit at a time when
increasing numbers of investors were embracing the idea that the Fed
was on the inflation case and would have it successfully resolved
before long.
   Money managers who had formerly been taking a cautious, defensive
approach found themselves drawn into a new performance race as stock
prices rose and they chased after the market with buy orders.
   The biggest risk began to be perceived as being ``underinvested''
in a rally, rather than the perils of a declining market.
   As The Bank Credit Analyst, a forecasting firm, put it before the
storm hit, ``bond and stock market investors are not prepared for
another turn of the credit screws.''
   Now, the latest rate increases have raised some new questions, or
at least reemphasized some old ones: Can the Fed restrain inflation
without inflicting some significant pain on the economy?
   Or is that an impossible mission, like saying you are going on a
diet and hoping to lose 15 pounds without cutting down on any of
your favorite foods?
   ``The challenge facing the Fed is to tighten policy enough to
calm inflation, but not enough to send the economy into a
recession,'' said Jack Lavery, research chief at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   ``The unpredictable delay between monetary tightening and a
slowing in economic activity makes that more difficult.''
   The extent of the new worries was readily event in the past
week's market numbers. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
closed Friday at 2,245.54, down 79.28 points from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.73 to 161.72;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped
7.23 to 399.96, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was down 4.46 at 321.49.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 154.03 million shares a day,
against 156.85 million the week before.
   The inflation data for January, of course, tell the story for
just one month, a notoriously unreliable time span from which to
interpret trends.
   Some observers were quick to point out that the data probably was
skewed by temporary factors, even maybe the weather.
   But Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, plainly took them
seriously, calling the report on consumer prices ``disturbing.''
That made it pretty hard for anyone else to shrug them off.
   ``We don't expect any slowdown in these kinds of figures for some
time,'' declares the current issue of the Merrill Lynch Market
Letter.
   ``Increasing pressures for inflation and interest rates indicate
the long expansion of the U.S. economy will run out of steam in the
second half of this year.''

<HEAD>Inflationary Spiral May Keep Spinning Despite Fed's Efforts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of criticism for too much talk and
too little action, the Federal Reserve Board finally punctuated its
anti-inflation rhetoric by hoisting short-term interest rates and
draining reserves from the banking system.
   But some analysts say the central bank may eschew truly bold
maneuvers in its inflation battle, not wanting to risk recession at
a time of unprecedented problems in the savings and loan industry.
   The actions last week demonstrated the central bank's
independence from the Bush administration, which has resisted the
notion that inflation has veered dangerously out of control and
brakes should be applied, in the form of higher interest rates.
   To some analysts, the board seemed to be abandoning its strategy
of gradually defusing inflationary pressures through small,
incremental increases in interest rates.
   The evidence they cite is an increase in the federal funds rate,
a closely watched interest charge that affects banks' borrowing
costs.
   Over much of the past year, the key rate crept up slowly from
just under 6 percent in January 1988. Lately, its pace has quickened
sharply and by the end of last week it was quoted at 9} percent. The
Fed essentially forced the rate up by sucking federal funds out of
the system.
   In addition, on Friday the Fed raised its discount rate, which is
the interest the central bank charges on loans to commercial banking
institutions.
   The increase to 7 percent from 6.5 percent was seen as a symbolic
gesture, underscoring the upward trend in short-term rates. It
followeddecisions by the country's commercial banks to hike their
prime lending rates, benchmarks on which interest rates for many
consumer and business loans are based.
   While some analysts were applauding the Fed for administering a
dose of much-needed monetary restraint, others were unsatisfied with
the strength of the medicine. The doubters are so troubled by
inflation that they believe the Fed should wage a much more
aggressive fight.
   The debate may be academic.
   A number of analysts say the central bank may be kept from
tackling inflation as forcefully as it would like because to do so
might endanger economic growth, which could have disastrous
consequences.
   A recession would compound the troubles in the savings and loan
industry, possibly bringing down insurance companies in the process,
analysts contend. IN addition, a recession would make the debt
burdens of consumers, businesses and the government more costly to
bear.
   ``I do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates significantly
higher this year,'' said Albert A. Gross, a senior vice president at
Refco Inc. ``The problems in the thrift industry and the emerging
problems in the insurance industry will limit the Fed's willingness
to push interest rates higher.''
   ``I think the gradualism that the Fed is following is a practical
compromise,'' he said.
   Consumers may take comfort in his opinion about interest rates.
The implications for inflation, however, are less soothing.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co., finds the latest
inflation signs distressing.
   ``There are signs that an inflationary spiral has begun. This is
worrisome because once inflation starts to spiral it becomes very
difficult to reverse without significant financial restrictions on
the part of the Federal Reseve,'' Sinai said.
   The Labor Department reported last week that consumer prices shot
up 0.6 percent in January, or the equivalent of a 7.2 percent annual
rate. By contrast, the Consumer Price Index rose 1.1 percent in 1986.
   Prices at the wholesale level are surging, too, implying that
retail prices in the months ahead will move higher.
   ``Consumers are going to be slowly squeezed by both higher
interest rates and inflation,'' Sinai said. ``The message is the
central bank wants consumers to slow down spending.''
   ``Everyone is raising their inflation expectations,'' said Donald
Ratajczak, head of the Economic Forecaster Center at Georgia State
University. ``The Fed is now starting to make a moderate response.
Half the cows are out of the barn but it's still worthwhile to close
the gate before all of them are gone.''
   By pursuing its gradual approach in the past, the Fed made the
problem worse, Ratajczak said. What they should have done is take
swift, dramatic action.
   ``The Fed always follows gradualism and it never works. And you
have to ask after awhile,`Don't they read their own history?'''

   Import-starved consumers are on a spree,
buying candy and washing machines from the United States, French
wines and lingerie, Spanish ceramic tile, Japanese stereos, even
watering cans from Australia.
   Mexico's fledgling open market policy, which includes greatly
reduced import duties, has incited the biggest change in shopping
habits this country has seen in decades.
   ``It's like being in the United States,'' shopper Hector Juarez
said as he roamed Imagine, a 3-month-old store offering
state-of-the-art household goods and sophisticated novelty items
from around the world.
   Mexicans who wanted a microwave oven or an American refrigerator
used to patronize a black market, but within the last year that has
changed.
   ``We bought a Whirlpool washing machine from a local dealer. It's
nice to have the option,'' said Juarez.
   Another new store offers the latest in electronic goods and major
appliances from the United States, Japan and West Germany, while
huge signs announcing ``imported merchandise'' point the way to new
foreign goods sections in supermarkets and department stores.
   In Mexico City, imported bottled water has become the latest
fancy of the middle and upper classes.
   Mexico's former industrial protection policy required import
duties of up to 100 percent. With few exceptions, the restriction
effectively denied consumers access to foreign-made products by
making them too expensive.
   As a result, consumers complained, national manufacturers got
greedy and lazy, charging exorbitant prices for inferior merchandise
and rarely bothering to expand product lines.
   But Mexico, facing skyrocking inflation that reached 167 percent
in 1987, joined the international General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade in 1986, lowering import duties to 20 percent or less.
   The change was aimed partly at forcing domestic producers to
reduce prices and raise quality. Another goal was to increase
exports of manufactured goods by letting producers import raw
materials more cheaply.
   The boom in consumer imports has been escalating since mid-1988.
   ``It's helped control inflation because Mexican manufacturers
can't raise prices because the products coming from the other side
are cheaper,'' said Jose Luis Mastretta, a Chamber of Commerce
official in Monterrey, northern Mexico's largest and richest city.
   Inflation fell to about 50 percent in 1988.
   Under the relaxed tariffs, most foreign items cost an average of
5 percent to 35 percent above what they might cost in the United
States.
   An American candy bar costs about 55 cents, while a compact disc
that sells for about $16 in the United States goes for $19 here.
   ``People here are used to spending in dollars and they
automatically compare prices,'' said Imagine manager Miguel
Longoria. ``They'll pay 25 to 30 percent above U.S. prices, but if
it's more they'll go to the other side of the border.''
   From the United States, imports include cake mixes, clothes,
compact discs, barbecue grills, furniture, refrigerators and washing
machines.
   Total imports from January through October of 1988 increased by
55 percent to $15.2 billion, compared with the same period in 1987,
Bank of Mexico statistics show. Imports of consumer goods alone grew
by 150 percent.
   The higher imports hurt Mexico's balance of payments at the end
of 1988, reducing what had been a strong surplus. Nonetheless,
business economists don't expect a prolonged bout of voracious
import consumption because many Mexicans simply don't have the money.
   ``It's not an invasion of products because the buying power of
the the average Mexican is very limited. We're still in a
recession,'' Mastretta said.
   Most of the consumer goods sold here are aimed at middle-and
upper-class consumers, only about 25 percent of the population.
Nevertheess, those with a choice are buying imports, salesmen said.
   ``The client who comes in to buy a refrigerator is going to leave
with an American one,'' said Juan Angel Rodriguez, manager of the
Liverpool department store's appliance department.
   Rodriguez said 80 percent of the refrigerators, washing machines,
dryers and stoves he sells are American. Although Mexican prices are
becoming competitive, manufacturers have not yet raised quality to
match the imports.
   ``People are demanding higher quality. What they get with the
national brands are breakdowns, breakdowns, breakdowns,'' Rodriguez
said.
   At Liverpool, an imported Speed Queed clothes dryer with 18-pound
capacity and digital controls cost $680. The closest Mexican-made
equivalent, an Easy brand nondigital 11-pound dryer, cost $600.
   A Mexican-made washing machine that used to cost the equivalent
of $608 now has been reduced to about $470. An imported Maytag
washing machine was on sale for the same price.

   Increases in key lending rates by commercial
banks and the Federal Reserve triggered the biggest stock market
setback in three months and sent bond prices lower.
   In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average skidded
43.92 points to close Friday at 2,245.54. It was the biggest daily
drop since November.
   In the broader market, seven stocks fell for every two that rose
among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Bond prices lost as much as $4 for every $1,000 in face value,
sending interest rates higher with yields on 30-year bonds climbing
to 9.18 percent from 9.14 percent late Thursday.
   Short-term interest rates finished even higher: one-year Treasury
bills were yielding 9.50 percent late Friday, offering investors a
powerful incentive to dump stocks.
   The dollar finished mixed in foreign exchange trading.
   Gary Schlossberg, senior economist for Wells Fargo Bank in San
Francisco, said he expects interest rates will move even higher
before the economy slows enough to relieve inflationary pressures, a
goal the Fed has set for itself.
   ``The Fed will will have to continue to tighten a bit more
aggressively. A modest interest rate increase on the order of one
percentage point should be enough to cool the economy off
sufficiently,'' he said.
   Such a move would increase chances that the economy could fall
into a recession, another worry for stock investors trying to divine
the outlook for corporate profits.
   But, Schlossberg said, he believes ``the economy has enough
inherent strength'' that there is a better than even chance a
recession will avoided.
   Before the stock market opened Friday, the Federal Reserve
boosted its discount rate, its charge on loans to member banks, by a
half percentage point to a three-year high of 7 percent.
   Boosting the discount rate is the central bank's most dramatic
signal that it intends to tighten credit and slow economic growth,
thus reducing borrowing, wage and price demands.
   Some analysts said the Fed's move was overdue, especially in
light of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's statements that
he found recent inflation ``disturbing'' and that the bank would
continue erring on the side of retraint in fighting it.
   Fears about accelerating inflation have heightened in recent
weeks with news that wholesale prices shot up 1 percent in January
and that consumer prices were up 0.6 percent last month, their
biggest jump in two years.
   Until Friday, the central bank's moves had largely been conducted
behind the scenes, such as the draining of reserves from the banking
system, a maneuver that forces some banks to borrow to meet capital
requirements.
   The discount rate hike followed Chase Manhattan Bank's
announcement after the stock market closed on Thursday that it was
boosting its prime lending rate, a benchmark lending charge that
affects rates paid on commercial, home and other consumer loans, to
11{ percent from 11 percent.
   Other major banks matched Chase's increase on Friday. It was the
second half percentage point rise in the prime rate in the last two
weeks.
   The Fed last raised the discount rate in August, to 6.5 percent
from 6 percent. The discount rate last was at 7 percent from March
7, 1986, to April 18, 1986, when it dropped to 6.5 percent.

<HEAD>Can Pacific Northwest Support Two Major Commuters?</HEAD>

   A ``Help Wanted'' sign inside the beat-up
airplane hangar that serves as headquarters for United Express
announces openings for mechanics, accountants and pilots.
   It symbolizes the rapid growth of the Pasco-based airline
challenging Horizon Air for dominance in what has become one of the
country's hottest airline competitions, the struggle for the Pacific
Northwest commuter business.
   The fierceness of the competition is illustrated in the
Yakima-Seattle route, where passengers have a choice of seven direct
flights on United Express or eight on Horizon Air each business day.
   Officials for Horizon and United Express insist the skies over
the economically prosperous area are big enough for two airlines,
but Horizon has been feeling the heat in markets like Yakima, served
by both.
   ``Horizon essentially has negative growth,'' said Bill Whitlow, a
stock analyst for Dain Bosworth, Inc., a Seattle-based securities
firm. ``That was a result of United Express.''
   Horizon President John Kelly believes the competition is boosting
overall airplane ridership in the Northwest.
   He noted Horizon's slight increase in passengers from 1.38
million in 1987 to 1.39 million in 1988, despite United Express
boardings of 363,206 passengers during its first full year of
operations.
   ``They offer a good product and we offer a good product,'' said
John Beacham, director of marketing for United Express. ``It
encourages flying.''
   Unlike other airline competitions, however, passengers have not
benefited from any fare wars. A roundtrip cost for the 20-minute
flight from Yakima to Seattle is pegged at $130 to $178 for both
airlines, depending on discounts.
   Whitlow said that reflects the relatively equal competitive
standing of the two airlines, and their strong ties to larger
carriers.
   United Express is affiliated with United Airlines, which is No. 1
in the Seattle market and No. 2 in Portland. Horizon is owned by
Alaska Air Group Inc., No. 1 in Portland and No. 2 in Seattle,
Whitlow said.
   Neither has to cut fares to attract customers, he said.
   There is no question that Seattle-based Horizon has been feeling
the heat.
   In Yakima, its boardings dropped from 52,112 in 1987 to 40,022 in
1988, according to Yakima airport manager Gary Robbins.
   That decline can be attributed to United Express' 23,320
boardings in Yakima, Robbins said.
   ``We have been profitable in Yakima from the first month of
operation,'' Beacham said.
   ``The Northwest has some very good customer service, compared to
other parts of the nation,'' he said.
   Indeed, outposts like Moses Lake and Pullman, Wash., Lewiston,
Idaho, Kalispell, Mont., and Coos Bay, Ore., enjoy regularly
scheduled air service on at least one of the commuters.
   Horizon, formed with a Seattle-Yakima route in 1981, is much
larger, with 41 aircraft serving 30 cities in Washington, Oregon,
Montana, Idaho and Utah. It has 1,400 employees, compared with about
400 for United Express.
   Already spread into many smaller communities in the Northwest,
Kelly says the carrier is considering expansion into California,
where it would provide feeder traffic for Alaska Airlines flights in
San Francisco and Los Angeles.
   United Express, on the other hand, serves 13 cities in
Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana, and its expansion plans
center on breaking into Horizon's markets.
   One of five commuter airlines across the country that fly under
the marketing name owned by giant United Airlines, United Express is
owned and operated by WestAir Holdings Inc., of Fresno, Calif.
   United owns no equity in United Express, but the commuter is tied
in with United's reservation and frequent flyer system and fare
structure, and the planes are painted with the same colors.
   United Express's main mission is to feed passengers from smaller
communities to United's jet operations at Seattle, Portland and
Spokane, Beacham said. The company also plans to serve Boise, Idaho.
   Started in July 1987 with one Jetstream 31 19-seater flying from
Pasco to Seattle, United Express now has 16 Jetstreams and has
ordered eight 30-passenger Embraer Brasilia jetprops in a $48
million deal.
   For both airlines, the hottest battle is probably the
Seattle-Portland shuttle run.
   United Express offers 20 roundtrips per day and plans to up that
to 23 in March. Horizon offers over 30 flights between the cities
most days.
