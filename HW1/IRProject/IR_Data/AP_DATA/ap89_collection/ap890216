<HEAD>Cambodia Resistance Accuses Government of Intransigence in Talks</HEAD>

   Cambodian guerrilla leaders met
Thursday with senior officials in the Phnom Penh government and
charged the officials with merely engaging in a public relations
exercise in entering peace talks.
   The Cambodian officials and the three factions of the resistance
coalition held a 45-minute session apart from their larger meeting
with other Southeast Asian countries.
   The Cambodian officials ``maintained the same rigid attitude
which is not conducive to a comprehensive settlement of the
Kampuchean (Cambodian) problem,'' the coalition said in a statement.
   ``The plan proposed by the other side is tantamount to asking the
(resistance) to capitulate to a regime installed by foreign
forces,'' the statement said, adding that the government was only
engaging in a public relations exercise.
   The meeting is aimed at ending the war that began after
Soviet-armed Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978. Vietnamese
forces since have battled the guerrillas backed by China and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
   The guerrilla leaders said a solution was possible only on the
basis of a plan proposed by resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk. Phnom Penh rejected that plan even before the talks began.
   Resistance spokesman Thiounn Prasith read the statement aloud at
a news conference after a 10-minute monologue in which he railed
against Vietnam and the ``illegal'' Cambodian regime it was
``manipulating.''
   He denounced Vietnam for not allowing international supervision
of its troop withdrawal and claimed that about 20,000 Vietnamese
soldiers recently have disguised themselves in Cambodian uniforms.
   Vietnam in January said it will end its 10-year military
incursion in Cambodia by the end of September.
   Phnom Penh's representative, Hor Nam Hong, appeared at the same
news conference, insisting his side fervently desires a settlement.
   The organizer of the talks, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas, said that at the plenary session, the officials discussed
the Vietnamese withdrawal, an end to foreign military aid to the
guerrillas, and a mechanism for supervision and control of any
agreement.
   The session brought together Vietnam, its ally Laos, the Phnom
Penh government, the resistance, and the members of ASEAN: Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Brunei.
   A first round of talks, held in July, achieved no breakthroughs
but resulted in a consensus that Vietnam's withdrawal must be linked
to measures preventing the return to power of the Khmer Rouge, which
killed hundreds of thousands of people in Cambodia before Vietnam
toppled it.
   The communist Khmer Rouge is allied in the guerrilla coalition
with the forces of Sihanouk and Son Sann.
   Sihanouk, widely seen as the central figure in any future
Cambodian government, is boycotting the talks because Phnom Penh
rejected his peace plan.
   The plan included calls for dissolution of the Phnom Penh
government before a general election; introduction of an
international peace-keeping force to guarantee any settlement; and
specifics from Vietnam on its pledge to withdraw its troops from
Cambodia.

   The trial of a Lebanese hijacking suspect that
was to have started Thursday has been postponed because the judge
suffered a mild heart attack.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker, scheduled to preside at
the trial of Fawaz Younis, is listed in guarded condition in the
coronary care unit at Howard University Hospital. He was admitted
Wednesday.
   Prospective jurors have been told to telephone the courthouse
next Wednesday to learn when the case will go forward.
   Younis has been awaiting trial since September 1987 when he was
lured aboard an FBI chartered yacht in the Mediterranean.
   Younis is charged with leading the June 1985 hijacking of a
Jordanian airliner that was carrying several American passengers.
The plane was blown up at Beirut international Airport after
passengers and crew members were allowed to leave the aircraft.

<HEAD>Military Production at Arms Plant To Be Cut by Half</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says
Czechoslovakia's largest armarments plant will halve its military
production this year and increase its turnout of heavy equipment for
civilian use.
   The official CTK news agency said Wednesday that the cuts are
linked to recent disarmament initiatives by Czechoslovakia and other
East bloc countries that follow Moscow's lead in announcing cuts in
military manpower and spending.
   While halving its military production, the plant at Martin in
western Slovakia will make more equipment for civilian use, such as
construction and road-building machinery, CTK quoted company
director Jozef Uhrik as saying.
   Czechoslovakia last month announced it would cut defense spending
by 15 percent and trim its armed forces by 12,000 men in the next
two years. The cuts are also to include the scrapping of tanks and
other hardware.
   According to NATO figures, Czechoslovakia has about 145,000
troops.
   In December, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's said 50,000
Red Army troops would be withdrawn from East Germany, Czechoslovakia
and Hungary by the end of 1990. Poland, East Germany and Hungary
have also announced troop cuts.
   While the Warsaw Pact cuts seem designed to boost new East-West
talks next month in Vienna on reducing conventional arms and forces
across Europe, they also benefit the East's Communist governments by
freeing up funds for sorely needed economic reforms.

<HEAD>Arab, Jew Promote Coexistence With Music</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Israeli musicians, an Arab and a Jew, have
formed a duo to promote Arab-Jewish coexistence through music.
   The twosome, called ``The White Bird,'' features Taisir Elias on
violin and oud, a lute-like stringed instrument of the Middle East
and North Africa, and Migel Hartstein on guitar and banjo.
   Elias, an Israeli Arab from the northern town of Shfaram, said he
met Hartstein, a Jewish farmer, at the annual Israel Festival last
year and ``saw that we have to work together, to maintain this
coexistence, this musical dialogue.''
   Since then, the two have performed in front of small audiences in
Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa, and has twice traveled to West
Germany. In March, the musicians plan another tour abroad.
   Hartstein is a farmer from the Ganot agricultural cooperative
near Tel Aviv. Elias teaches at the Jerusalem Academy of Music.
   Their music is a gentle blend of Eastern tones and Western
popular music, with some motifs derived from American country music.
   ``It is human music, universal music,'' says Elias. ``It is a
mid-way meeting between Eastern and Western music. From there, we
start to create a special musical language.''
   But, according to Elias, there is a political message too: ``The
moment a Jew and an Arab play together and create together, they
cannot hate each other. That's the ideal we strive for.''

<TEXT>
   A convict and his girlfriend united their
palms to protest the man's robbery conviction and stuck together for
21 hours.
   Jeremiah Miller, 30, used an instant-bonding glue to affix his
right hand to the left hand of Maria Birchall, 25, when she visited
him at Frankland Prison on Tuesday.
   Miller's attorney, Peter Edwards, said his client wanted to
publicize his claim of innocence of the robbery charge that led to a
15-year sentence at Liverpool Crown Court two years ago.
   Edwards said Miller told him by telephone from the warden's
office that the couple, having received the publicity they wanted,
separated themselves within a few minutes using soap and water.
   He said there was no intervention by prison officials, who had
been talking to the couple since they glued themselves togther at 4
p.m. Tuesday.
   The lawyer said prison staff treated Miss Birchall ``extremely
well,'' making her as comfortable as possible during the protest and
giving her train fare back to Liverpool when it was over.
   A prison statement said warden Alistair Papps would consider what
disciplinary steps to take against Miller.

<HEAD>Oil Found That May Have Anointed Kings Of Israel</HEAD>

   Near the site where the Dead Sea scrolls were
found, archaeologists have dug up a 2,000-year-old flask filled with
an oil that might have been used to anoint the ancient Israelite
kings.
   Joseph Patrich of Hebrew University unveiled the flask Wednesday
and said the oil, which has a honey-like consistency, may be the
only surviving sample of the balsam oil used as an aromatic body
cream or perfume.
   ``After conducting extensive laboratory analysis and checking
literary sources, there is a good possibility that what we have here
is the fragrant balsam oil that was famous throughout the Roman
Empire,'' he said.
   The oil matches a discription of a perfume mentioned by the Roman
historian Pliny. Known as persimmon oil, it was distilled from a
bush-like plant now believed to be extinct.
   The ancient perfume was very expensive _ a sort of Chanel No. 5
of its day _ and was coveted throughout the Roman Empire.
   The persimmon plant, which was different from the modern tree of
the same name, grew only in the Dead Sea oasis of En Gedi and around
Jericho. The ancient Israelites guarded the secret formula for
making the oil, going so far as to post warnings against anyone
revealing the process.
   When the Roman legions approached, the Israelites tried to
destroy the orchard of plants. Pliny's writings indicate the Romans
took over production, archaeologists say.
   Hebrew University chemist Zeev Aizenshtat, who spent three months
analyzing the substance, said whatever fragrance the oil had
evaporated in the desert cave, where summer temperatures hover over
104 degrees.
   He said he was unable to make an absolute identification because
there were no surviving samples of the ancient plant to make a
comparison.
   ``This oil is very different from other ancient oils in that it
did not deteriorate,'' Aizenshtat said. ``This may be the oldest oil
that contains such organic matter and whose properties have not been
greatly altered by chemical reactions over time.''
   The clay juglet stands 5 inches high and contains about 1{ to 3{
ounces of the reddish oil, which is well-preserved and dates to the
1st century B.C. It was wrapped in palm leaves and carefully
concealed.
   It was found last year by the expedition, which includes an
American team of volunteers from the Institute of Judaic-Christian
Research in Arlington, Texas.
   The flask was buried in a 3-foot-deep pit in the honeycomb of
caves at Qumran, 50 miles southeast of Jerusalem and the site where
the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in 1947.
   The scrolls, ancient holy writings including the Book of Isaiah,
were hidden by the Essene Sect in the 1st century A.D. to avoid
plundering by the advancing Romans.
   The expedition will resume digging soon as part of a 6-year-old
project to explore the thousands of caves in Qumran overlooking the
Dead Sea.
   Menachem Boorstein, a scholar at the Mercaz HaRav Yeshiva in
Jerusalem, said the oil was one of 11 holy fragrances burned as
incense on the altar of ancient Jewish Temple. It is mentioned in
Exodus and in the collection of Jewish law and commentary called the
Talmud.
   Boorstein said the Talmud describes the oil as highly inflammable
and tells the story of a woman killing her daughter by convincing
her she should light a candle after rubbing her body with the oil to
make its perfume effect stronger.
   The balsam oil, described by some ancient rabbis as more valuable
than gold, was used to annoint the kings of Israel after King
Solomon in the 10th Century B.C.E.
   ``During the ceremony, it would be poured across the king's head
in the form of an X,'' Boorstein said.

<HEAD>Woman Fails to Lose Weight; Must Pay A Hefty Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who was told she could either lose
100 pounds or pay a $500 fine as part of her sentence in a marijuana
conviction failed to drop the weight and must now put up the dough,
a judge said.
   Tina Usinger, 29, was convicted last year of possession of
marijuana with intent to distribute. Judge Michael Fisher told her
he'd knock $5 off the $500 fine for every pound she lost before she
next returned to court.
   The unusual sentence had been recommended by her former probation
agent, who reasoned that with a better self-image, Ms. Usinger would
be less likely to turn to criminal activity.
   If she lost 100 pounds, she wouldn't have to pay a fine.
   But on Tuesday, Ms. Usinger weighed 265 pounds, the same as she
did when Fisher first fined her.
   At the sentencing, Fisher stayed a two-year prison term for Ms.
Usinger. He said he was satisfied that she had met other conditions
of probation, including 100 hours of community service work and
participation in a drug program.
   The weight reduction incentive, Fisher said, was an option, not a
condition of probation. ``If she'd rather pay the fine, that's her
choice,'' he said.

<HEAD>Anger Runs Deep In Moslem Community; Vengeance Does Not</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The anger over Salman Rushdie and his novel ``The
Satanic Verses'' is quick to flare and shared by many in London's
Moslem community, from the sweetmeats shopkeeper to the Bangladeshi
banker.
   But while they spare no insult for the author they accuse of
blasphemy, many in the city's narrow East End streets don't seek
vengeance and reject Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order to execute
him.
   The Imams and Mosque council in Britain issued an appeal to ``all
imams'' _ Moslem clergymen _ to respect British law.
   An information office representing Prince Reza Pahlavi, son of
the late Shah of Iran, said the Iranian government's reaction
exemplifies the ``brutal and arbitrary intolerance that is rampant
in Khomeini's Islamic Republic.''
   The statement, however, said the prince was sympathetic to
objections to the book.
   In conversations with immigrants in the East End's Brick Lane
shops, some cheered the death call. But many said the author, who
has canceled a U.S. tour and dropped from sight, should live.
   ``To kill him is not going to solve the problem,'' said Naim
Sheikh, the owner of a shop selling leather goods who called for a
law that would prevent such books from being written again.
   ``There must be some way that governments can approve a
resolution that in future no writer should have a right to write
against any prophet _ Mohammed, Jesus or Moses,'' he said.
   Moslems revere Mohammed as the prophet who brought Allah's
revelations to mankind in the Koran, the holy book of Islam.
   ``But do I personally agree with the ayatollah? It doesn't
matter,'' said Sheikh, one of the many Moslem Bangladeshis living in
the Brick Lane area.
   ``You can't stop the ayatollah. You can't stop the people who
will do the job ... Anyone who kills Rushdie will become a hero in
the Islamic world.''
   Like Sheikh, most Moslems acknowledged they haven't read the
book. Most learned about it at one of the five mosques located in a
one-square-mile area of this district, from leaflets, or from
television reports.
   ``He insulted our prophet, our religion. From TV we know this,''
said a shopkeeper selling sticky sweets who refused to give his name.
   Even though they haven't read the book, they are sure it insults
their prophet and are quick to say so when the novel is mentioned.
   ``Our older people read it, they say it's wrong, so we believe
them,'' Nassim Khan, a Pakistani Moslem, said as he ate lunch at a
modest tandoori restaurant. ``They've been studying for years and
years and they should know.''
   Maqbool Ali-Kassam, waiting for his takeout tea, boomed from
across the room: ``Anyone who denies the religion of Islam shall be
killed.''
   Ali-Kassam, a taxi cab radio controller who calls himself a
follower of the ayatollah, said he believes Rushdie deliberately
meant to insult Islam.
   Dozens of drivers from his company stayed at the office until
early Wednesday morning, he said, arguing about the book and the
execution order. ``Some said he didn't mean anything about Islam,
others wanted him killed.''
   Many Moslems believe Rushdie, 41, insults Mohammed by portraying
him as a character called Mahound, a prophet of a city called
Jahilia. Mahound was a medieval corruption of the word Mohammed.
   They are especially angered by one sequence in which prostitutes
are given the names of some of Mohammed's nine wives and by the
book's implication that Mohammed, not Allah, may have been the real
author of the Koran.
   Rushdie was born into a Moslem family in Bombay, India, and
educated in Cambridge. He lives in London. His novel has sold more
than 100,000 copies since it was published in Britain in September
to critical acclaim.
   ``Previously Mohammed has been criticized, but not in this naked
way,'' said Abul Khair, a top officer at the Sonali Bank,
Bangladesh's state bank, on Brick Lane. ``It is intolerable for
Moslems.''
   But he doesn't agree with the ayatollah. ``We don't want
violence. Islam is a peaceful religion,'' he said.
   Restaurant manager Asaad Ramjaun, a Mauritian immigrant, said of
Rushdie: ``I think he's the devil himself.''
   ``We understand this is a free society, but I think this is
freedom of abuse,'' he said. ``But since this is a free society _ he
shouldn't be killed. He should be given a chance.''

   Authorities badly underestimated the health
problems the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster would cause, with
reported cancer cases doubling in a region near the stricken plant
that was not evacuated, Moscow News reported.
   The article Wednesday in the weekly newspaper said calves are
born routinely without heads and limbs in the radiation-contaminated
area of the Soviet Ukraine.
   It said more than half the children of the Narodichsky region _
an agriculturally rich area within 30 miles of the plant _ have
thyroid gland illnesses, which can be caused by exposure to
radiation.
   The newspaper's correspondent, Vladimir Kolinko, said one woman,
who cares for pigs at a tainted farm, asked, ``My daughter recently
got married. What kind of grandson will I have?''
   In all, 31 people died in the immediate aftermath of the
explosion and fire at the plant on April 26, 1986.
   The disaster sent a cloud of radiation around the world.
   Moscow News reported that elevated levels of radioactive
cesium-137 were detected among many residents of the Narodichsky
region, which was not evacuated after the accident.
   It said, ``Health officials of the republic insist there is no
health danger for people outside a 19-mile zone around the atomic
power station.''
   Since the accident, Soviet officials stressed time and again that
radiation levels were safe in all but the immediate area surrounding
the plant. They generally discounted warnings from some Western
doctors that cases of cancer and other diseases would soar.
   The Moscow News article, however, was the second this month in
the Soviet press to suggest health problems from the accident were
mounting.
   The official Tass news agency reported Feb. 9 that cancer and
other diseases are on the rise in Byelorussia, the republic
neighboring the Ukraine that also was contaminated by Chernobyl.
Tass said authorities had just determined that one-fifth of
Byelorussia is contaminated.
   Moscow News said lip, mouth and other cancers doubled among
Narodichsky region residents since the accident.
   Kolinko said residents had a right to be outraged.
   He wrote that if the government is serious about its pledges,
residents ``would have the right to demand _ to demand and not ask _
for full compensation ... not to mention the right to full
information about people's health and the condition of the land.''
   At the Petrovsky animal farm, the newspaper said, veterinarian
Peter Kudin reported that during the five years before Chernobyl,
three cases of birth defects occurred among pigs and there were no
abnormal calves.
   In the year after the disaster, 37 pigs and 27 calves had birth
defects, he said. In the first nine months of 1988, 41 pigs and 35
calves were born with abnormalities _ ``the calves frequently
without heads, limbs, eyes or ribs, the pigs goggle-eyed or with
deformed skulls.''
   The animals had been feeding on fields where wind had blown
radioactive particles, the newspaper said.
   It said that uncontaminated meat and dairy products are brought
in for residents, but some people ignore doctors' warnings and drink
milk from local cows and pick fruit and vegetables from their garden
plots.

<TEXT>
   The owner and editor of the popular and
award-winning newspaper ABC Color began planning its first edition
in nearly five years as soon as he heard Gen. Alfredo Stroessner had
been ousted.
   ``We're going to come out with the same kinds of stories that
prompted them to shut us down before _ corruption, narcotics
trafficking, and the violation of human rights,'' said Aldo
Zuccolillo.
   Warming to the subject, the 59-year-old journalist added, ``We
want to become permanent reminders to Gen. Rodriguez of the promises
he made when he assumed power.''
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez toppled Stroessner on Feb. 3 and almost
immediately gave Zuccolillo permission to resume publishing ABC
Color as he promised to respect freedom of the press and human
rights.
   The newspaper, best known for its investigative stories, was once
the most widely read daily in this South American capital of 900,000
people.
   ``I am certain that Gen. Rodriguez will not ask me nor anyone to
refrain from publishing an article because he doesn't like it, ''
said Zuccolillo, who founded ABC Color in 1967.
   Zuccolillo frequently clashed with Stroessner and his aides,
enduring threats, arrests and, finally, closure of the
80,000-circulation paper by plainclothes police in March 1984. The
stated reason: the paper was provoking class hatred among
Paraguayans.
   In preceding years, seven ABC Color journalists were arrested,
and one expelled. Zuccolillo himself was jailed twice, the first
time for 11 days, the second for a week.
   He says he's sure that won't happen again: ``Now, we'll no longer
have the overnight bags that we kept behind the doors in the
newsroom in case the police came and took us directly to jail.''
   The new issue, to hit the street in about a month, will differ
little from editions in the past that won citations from, among
other, the InterAmerican Press Society. Three years ago, Zuccolillo
was awarded the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize from Columbia
University's journalism school.
   ``We're going to investigate everything. We have the staff and
the sources of information,'' Zuccolillo said. ``Now you're going to
begin to see news sources appear that in other times would hide
because they were scared to death.''
   In the days following the coup, Zuccolillo saw a constant stream
of foreign reporters who tried to get a better handle on Paraguayan
politics from a veteran observer.
   ``I think Gen. Rodriguez has no other option than to fulfill his
promises,'' said Zuccolillo. ``The Paraguayan people are totally fed
up with Stroessner and Streossnerism.''
   Zuccolillo said hard work and skill, not luck, had kept
Stroessner in power for nearly 35 years.
   ``Stroessner had a great Machiavellian political talent to
achieve his objectives,'' Zuccolillo said. ``He was a planner, he
was very intelligent, he had a great power of synthesis and an
extraordinary memory, but he also was immoral, unscrupulous,
bloodthirsty and a corrupter.''
   Zuccolillo, who broke with Paraguayan tradition by forbidding his
journalists to accept government payoffs, plans to trace just how
corrupt his former nemesis was.
   ``The first clues are going to come from outside, from
Switzerland,'' he said. ``I already have a couple of Swiss
journalists who are willing to help me, and I'm going to send a
couple of reporters from here ... when I get some money together.''
   Investigative reports published by ABC Color in the past alleged
that by overcharging gasoline sold by the private oil company
Refineria Paraguaya S.A., Stroessner bilked the country of about
$800 million over five years in the 1970s.
   ``Stroessner might barely have a $10,000 bungalow (in Paraguay),
but he has well over a billion dollars overseas,'' claimed
Zuccolillo. Stroessner was exiled to Brazil, where he is said to own
a home.
   Zuccolillo dismisses the reservations some have that the
Rodriguez government may become the equivalent of ``Stroessnerism
without Stroessner.''
   ``You can't have Stroessnerism without Stroessner if you have a
free press,'' he said. ``A free press is the antidote of the people
against totalitarianism.''

   A former mental patient described as a
``disgruntled employee'' shot three women co-workers to death and
killed himself at the office of a savings and loan association
Wednesday, police said.
   The gunman was identified as Emanuel Tsegaye, 33, of Silver
Spring, Md., police said.
   A spokesman for the Maryland State Health Department said Tsegaye
had been released about a year ago after five years at the Clifton
T. Perkins Hospital Center in Jessup, Md. Tsegaye was sent to the
mental hospital after he was ruled criminally insane following his
arrest on charges of assaulting a police officer.
   Two victims have also been identified by police as Cynthia
Mitchell, 28, of Landover, Md., and Tanya Walker, 23, of Fort
Washington, Md. The names of the other victims were were not
immediately released.
   Police in this Washington, D.C., suburb said the three people
killed in addition to Tsegaye were all female employees at Chevy
Chase Federal Savings Bank.
   Tsegaye also wounded Edward Johnson, 22, of Silver Spring, Md.,
police said. Johnson, who was shot in the jaw, is in critical
condition at Suburban Hospital following surgery.
   According to Montgomery County police spokesman Officer George
Ludington, Tsegaye got off an elevator at the credit card department
of the S&amp;L at the end of the lunch hour, walked down a hallway and
through a set of double doors, and shot Johnson and one of the women.
   The Ethiopian native then went into a nearby lunchroom and killed
the other two women, Luddington said.
   Tsegaye then turned his .38-caliber revolver on himself,
Ludington said.
   ``It happened very quickly,'' Ludington said. He described the
gunman as a ``disgruntled employee.'' A fellow worker said the man
was a collector in the credit card department.
   ``All of the people that I have talked to about it are very
disturbed, very surprised by it ... because all indications were
that Mr. Tsegaye was doing very well,'' Mike Golden, spokesman for
the state health department, told WUSA-TV.
   The station said Tsegaye had originally been arrested after
approaching a Montgomery County police officer and saying, ``I want
to die, kill me,'' and then reaching for the officer's gun. He was
charged with attempted murder in that case, according to the
television report.
   A Montgomery County police official said late Wednesday they
would not release any details about Tsegaye's background.
   Another employee, Dean Abellano said he was sitting next to
Johnson when Tsegaye came into the office.
   ``First he shot Ed and then I went under my chair,'' he said.
Abellano, who was not injured, said Tsegaye had had an argument with
a co-worker earlier in the day. He said that person was not injured.
   Alex Chapin, of Atlanta, who was on the telephone with an
employee of the S&amp;L when the shootings occurred, said he heard
screaming in the background.
   ``I hear a banging at the door and ... I heard somebody say,
`Don't let him in, don`t let him in,' Chapin said in a telephone
interview. ``And then ... I hear another scream and I hear another
shot. ...
   ``Out of horror, I'm sitting here listening to the phone, 'cause
I don't know if it's a hostage situation going on or what. And I
waited and waited and waited until I heard the police sirens, so I
figure somebody's on the scene at that point. Then I heard somebody
say something, `Why don't they come up here?' and that's when I
heard some more shooting and then the phone went dead,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bank Board Member Fails to Keep Stock-Sale Pledge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the board that regulates the
savings and loan industry has not sold his stock in a family
business despite a sworn pledge to the Senate and a legal
requirement that he do so.
   The Associated Press learned that Roger Martin continues to hold
a 29 percent share in Pope Scientific Inc., a Menomonee Falls, Wis.,
company that makes laboratory glassware. Martin has valued his share
of the company at $100,000 to $250,000.
   Martin, a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and other
employees of the agency blame a paperwork jam and confusing rules
for his failure to sell his stock or be relieved of his promise.
   The bank board oversees the operation of more than 3,000 savings
and loan institutions, regulating their transactions and auditing
their records.
   ``I'm still waiting for an opinion from the ethics people,''
Martin said Wednesday.
   ``Basically, I didn't want to get rid of it because you can't get
rid of it,'' Martin said of his stake in the company. ``It is a
very, very small company and it's all family held.''
   Martin's wife, Ann, holds a 51 percent interest in the company
and is its president. Her stake in the company is valued at more
than $250,000, according to Martin's financial disclosure forms.
Martin had been chairman of the company from 1983 until he became a
member of the bank board.
   Although the company does occasional work for the government, its
business would have little or no occasion for contact with the bank
board.
   But Martin was advised to divest himself of the holding because
his stake in the company was so large that under bank board rules,
Pope Scientific would be considered his ``alter ego,'' according to
a letter from Harry W. Quillian, the board's general counsel and
ethics officer.
   ``This relationship would, therefore, have a substantial effect
on Pope's ability to do business,'' Quillian wrote in a letter
attached to Martin's 1987 financial disclosure form. ``Mr. Martin
has indicated that he will transfer his interest in Pope to his wife
or other relative to avoid any conflict or appearance of conflict
from his ownership interest in Pope.''
   In sworn testimony during his confirmation hearings before the
Senate Banking Committee in 1987, Martin was asked whether he
pledged to abide by the ethics finding.
   Martin responded, ``Yes.''
   Banking Committee spokesman Kevin Gottlieb said he knew nothing
about Martin's holding in Pope Scientific or his promise to dispose
of it, but a blanket pledge such as the one Martin gave the
committee is more than ceremonial.
   ``Generically, the committee understands all standard statements
required by people who testify to be very serious,'' Gottlieb said.
``The committee wouldn't ask for it unless they thought it was
serious, and they expect to be told the truth.''
   Under federal ethics laws, the property should have been disposed
of within 90 days of Martin's confirmation by the Senate in August
1987, with notice given to both the Office of Government Ethics and
the Senate Banking Committee.
   Martin said Wednesday that he had sold off his other holdings as
promised when he became a member of the board but did not dispose of
his Pope Scientific stock because he was waiting for an opinion from
the staff.
   ``I got rid of everything else. ... I liquidated everything I
owned at a substantial cost,'' he said.
   Both Quillian and Dan Kurtenbach, another agency ethics officer,
were in the room with Martin when he was interviewed by telephone,
and both said the initial opinion that Martin should sell the stock
was wrong.
   ``There was never any question of impropriety or any conflict of
interest,'' Quillian said. ``It was an extremely technical question
of the status of the company under the board's regulations.
   ``We think that in the first instance the interpretation went too
far. We bent over backward, as did Mr. Martin, and on reflection we
believe that we were too technical and too strict.''
   Nevertheless, neither the ethics office nor the banking committee
has been informed of Martin's intention to keep his share of the
company.
   Kurtenbach said his office was to blame for failure to notify the
ethics office and the banking committee.
   ``I think that was a part where we fell down,'' he said. ``It was
just an administrative screw-up.''
   The government ethics office, the watchdog agency for the
executive branch, also has not received a copy of Martin's annual
financial disclosure report, although one should have been handed
over no later than last September, according to Tom Zorn, who is
assigned to monitor the bank board's ethics compliance.
   Martin's form, along with those of the other two members of the
board, M. Danny Wall and Lawrence White, are on file at the agency
but have not been forwarded to the government ethics office.
   Kurtenbach said this was because the agency was behind in its
paperwork.
   Zorn said in his discussions with the bank board, there were
``loose ends'' to be tied up with Martin's finances, one of which
was the Pope Scientific stock.
   The bank board staff was most concerned about Martin's stock in
MGIC Investment Corp. and his position as senior vice president of
Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corp. Martin sold the stock, resigned
from MGIC and promised to take no part in board actions on matters
that may come up dealing with MGIC or the mortgage insurance
industry.

<HEAD>Bush Seeks Rights Chief to Reverse Reynolds' Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The four top candidates for the Justice
Department's chief civil rights job all would sharply change the
controversial policies that William Bradford Reynolds followed for
the last eight years.
   A leading candidate is Evan Kemp Jr., a disabled-rights advocate
who publicly battled Reynolds over a proposal to reduce
anti-discrimination protection for handicapped people.
   Kemp, a member of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, is
being considered for the post of assistant attorney general in
charge of the Justice Department's civil rights division, said
administration sources.
   Confined to a wheelchair, Kemp has been an advocate for
handicapped Americans and once successfully sued the Securities and
Exchange Commission after being told his disability would bar his
promotion to supervisor.
   Also under consideration are Daniel Rinzel, minority chief
counsel to the Senate's permanent investigations subcommittee and
Martin Gerry, former head of the Office of Civil Rights for the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare who has served as
counsel to the Wednesday Group of moderate House Republicans.
   A former career Justice Department employee, Rinzel once headed
the criminal section of the civil rights division and set records
for the number of cases brought. That performance won him a
promotion under Reynolds to deputy assistant attorney general.
   Another candidate is James P. Turner, longtime career deputy
assistant attorney general in the division who early in the civil
rights movement prosecuted white supremacists and other rights
violators in the deep South, sources said.
   ``Everyone on the list would turn it around,'' one of the
candidates, who knows the others, said on condition of anonymity.
   David Runkel, an aide to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, said
``we're looking for someone whose views reflect Thornburgh's and the
president's views on the importance of the civil rights division.''
   ``We're looking for somebody who can work with civil rights
organizations,'' said Runkel.
   The major civil rights organizations tangled regularly with
Reynolds throughout the Reagan administration.
   Reynolds helped formulate and direct the Reagan administration's
policy of challenging affirmative action hiring quotas. He also
moved to overturn court-ordered busing programs and to restrict
federal guarantees for women's rights and the rights of the mentally
ill and disabled.
   Without committing himself on specific issues, President Bush has
said he wants civil rights policy to be sharply different from that
followed under Ronald Reagan.
   Thornburgh reflected the new administration's stance by meeting
with civil rights leaders, notably Jesse Jackson.
   After meeting with the attorney general last month, Jackson
praised Thornburgh and said, ``The lights have been turned back on
in the Justice Department.''
   Runkel noted Thornburgh's ``interest in the civil rights area
that goes back to the 1960s.''
   ``He knows many of the civil rights leaders first hand,'' Runkel
said. ``He is personally committed to making sure the laws are
enforced.''
   While Thornburgh is still reviewing other applications, Kemp ``is
certainly a leading candidate,'' said one source, who spoke
Wednesday on condition of anonymity.
   Kemp confirmed in a telephone interview that he met with
Thornburgh this week and was told a decision would be made ``in a
couple of weeks.''
   The appointment, which will be made by Bush with Thornburgh's
recommendation, is subject to Senate confirmation.
   Kemp said he had been told earlier by White House counsel C.
Boyden Gray that he was a leading candidate for the position and
nothing that Thornburgh said during their meeting dispelled that
impression.
   ``I just thought it was a good interview,'' Kemp said.
   Without directly criticizing Reynolds, Kemp said the GOP's
failure to attract black voters was due in part to the Reagan
administration's civil rights record.
   ``I think it's very important for the Republican Party to have a
civil rights record they can run on and attract votes from groups
covered by the civil rights laws.''
   ``I've seen estimates as low as 9 percent of the black voters
voted for Bush in 1988,'' Kemp said. ``I don't think that's good for
black people to be taken for granted by the Democratic Party or for
this country.''
   Kemp, who is confined to a wheelchair because of a paralyzing
illness and subsequent injury, headed the Disability Rights Center
when he battled Reynolds in 1982.
   At issue was a proposal by a Reagan administration task force on
deregulation to weaken rules prohibiting companies and institutions
that receive federal funds from discriminating against handicapped
employees.
   ``It was very important to the disability rights movement that we
retain the rules and regulations and Brad was very critical of me,''
Kemp said, recalling the dispute.
   At one point, Kemp demanded Reynolds' resignation from the
Justice Department. The proposal to change 1977 regulations
enforcing the anti-discrimination law was withdrawn by the
administration.

<HEAD>Members of Senate Communications Panel Hold Stock in Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a Senate communications panel held
stock in the industry and acted on issues that could have affected
their holdings, a practice that is forbidden in the executive branch
but legal for lawmakers.
   Critics complain about the double standard on
conflict-of-interest rules, but others say it would be impossible to
apply the same standards to the executive and legislative branches.
   The Associated Press selected the communications subcommittee of
the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee to show
examples of stock holdings and congressional action. Financial
information for the 11 senators came from their disclosure forms for
1987, the most recent year available.
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., the committee's chairman and
member of the subcommittee, had larger holdings in
telecommunications than any other senator on the communications
panel.
   On Aug. 21, 1987, he bought about $100,000 worth of stock in
McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the day the company went public.
In December, Hollings helped postpone the Federal Communications
Commission's plans to hold lotteries for licensing cellular
telephones in rural areas, according to Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash.
   As committee chairman, Hollings had to approve a Jan. 27, 1988,
communications subcommittee hearing on the FCC's proposed lottery
idea. John E. McCaw Jr., executive vice president of McCaw,
testified in opposition to portions of the FCC's plan.
   Hollings said he didn't know he owned the stock because his
broker bought it for him.
   ``As soon as it was brought to my attention that I owned it, I
told him to get rid of it, which he did,'' Hollings said through a
spokesman. He said he first found out about his holdings in McCaw in
February 1988, but it is unclear whether he made a profit or a loss
on the stock. Some of the stock was sold in November 1987.
   In 1987, Hollings also sold between $100,000 and $250,000 in
stock and $2,000 and $10,000 in options in General Electric Corp.,
which in 1986 purchased the National Broadcasting Co.
   A communications subcommittee member, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
said he had no qualms about his longtime interest in Northern
Television in Anchorage, Alaska, which owns two television stations
and two radio stations in his home state. The holding is worth less
than $5,000.
   ``It's not a substantial holding,'' Stevens said. His votes
include one against a bill extending the fairness doctrine, which
required stations to air opposing views.
   Marla Romash, an aide to Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., said the
senator is sensitive to conflict of interest issues but hasn't felt
the $1,540 in Tandy Corp. stock owned by his wife, Tipper, to be an
issue. Tandy, which manufactures electronic goods including
telephones, is the parent company of Radio Shack.
   Gore voted for legislation to require all telephones to be
equipped with devices so they are compatible with hearing aids.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., dismissed the notion there could be a
conflict between his duties on the panel and the less than $5,000
worth of BellSouth Corp. stock his wife inherited. ``The amount of
stock doesn't amount to a grain of sand on the beach,'' Phil Norman,
Ford's spokesman said.
   One member of the full committee, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.,
said she avoided voting ``a couple of times'' on issues that dealt
with communications because her family had interests in radio
stations. Mrs. Kassebaum sold WREN Broadcasting Inc., in Topeka,
Kan., for more than $250,000 in January 1987.
   Some other senators have their holdings in blind trusts,
including Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., a member of the communications
subcommittee, as a way of dealing with potential conflicts.
   The basic federal conflict law makes it a crime for executive
branch employees to take government action in which their immediate
families have a financial interest, unless a waiver is obtained. The
top penalty is two years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   But no law or rule prevents members of Congress from holding
assets that might conflict with their official duties. So lawmakers
can routinely craft or vote on legislation that could affect their
financial interests.
   One argument for not applying the conflict law to them is that
their assets are publicly disclosed so voters can decide for
themselves if senators or representatives are acting for personal
enrichment.

<HEAD>Complaint Over Favoritism Prompts Limit on Naval Computer Contracts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is limiting the Navy's authority
to award computer contracts after six companies complained the
service was unfairly partial to International Business Machines Corp.
   The General Services Administration, which oversees government
buying, said Wednesday that for a minimum of 60 days, the Navy will
have to submit for review any computer purchase in excess of $2.5
million.
   Previously, GSA let the Navy award computer contracts of up to
$10 million.
   ``This action clearly shows the administrator's intent to
increase GSA's oversight over Navy computer buys and to fully
cooperate with our committee's investigation into alleged favoritism
toward IBM's systems,'' said Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich.,
chairman of the House Committee on Government Operations.
   The panel, which has been investigating the way computer
contracts are awarded, last week asked the government to restrict
the Navy's authority.
   Conyers cited government statistics indicating that IBM currently
holds almost 55 percent of the Navy's large-scale computer base,
compared with the company's 37 percent share government-wide.
   The committee had received a complaint last November from six IBM
competitors that they have been frozen out of much of the Navy's
multibillion-dollar computer market.
   The companies complained in a letter to former Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci that Navy procurement officials had tailored the bid
specifications so that only IBM could win although many of the
companies offer ``clones'' or duplicates of IBM systems at lower
prices.
   The five-page letter was signed by executives of the Amdahl
Corp.; Memorex Telex Corp.; PacifiCorp Capital Inc.; VION Corp.; NCR
Compten; and Storage Technology Corp.
   A Navy spokesman said Wednesday the service would have no comment
until it reviewed the GSA decision.
   The House committee also has asked the General Accounting Office,
the investigative arm of Congress, to investigate complaints that
federal agencies are restricting their computer procurements to
favor IBM.
   The GAO was asked last week to supply to the committee within 60
days a broad evaluation of the extent that federal agencies restrict
their procurements to IBM ``code-compatible'' systems.
   With expenditures of about $17.4 billion last year on computer,
communications and data processing equipment and services, the
government is the industry's largest single purchaser.

<HEAD>Nader Says Tax the Wealthy, Stock Sales to Finance Rescue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wealthy should pay more to resolve the
savings and loan crisis, says consumer activist Ralph Nader in
claiming the administration's rescue plan puts the burden on the
poor and middle class.
   ``The people of this country (are) demanding that the government
sock it to the rich and powerful who caused the savings and loan
crime and who will benefit from its resolution,'' he said at a news
conference Wednesday.
   Last week, the president proposed spending $200 billion over the
next 30 years _ about half of it from general tax revenues _ to sell
or close insolvent institutions.
   Nader, in a 23-page ``Report to U.S. Taxpayers on the Savings and
Loan Crisis,'' said spending general tax revenue on S&amp;Ls would
squeeze vital government programs such as education and housing.
   But he also acknowledged that imposing a major share of the
cleanup cost on healthy S&amp;Ls could drive some institutions toward
insolvency.
   As an alternative, Nader offered four tax increase proposals,
each of which would raise about $10 billion a year, enough to pay
the interest on government borrowing to resolve the problem. They
are:
   _boosting the marginal income tax rate for the nation's
wealthiest taxpayers _ childless couples with taxable income higher
than $149,250 a year, for instance _ from 28 percent to 33 percent.
   _levying a 0.5 percent tax on stock sales, which totaled $2.3
trillion in 1987. Nader argued this would dampen speculation and
encourage long-term investing.
   _raising corporate taxes, estimated at $107 billion this year, by
10 percent.
   _a combination of higher deposit insurance premiums and new
excise taxes on mutual funds, junk bonds, leveraged buyout deals and
mortgages for luxury homes.
   Nader said any increase in deposit insurance premiums paid by
banks and S&amp;Ls should be accompanied by measures restricting
institutions from passing on the higher cost to their smallest
customers.
   ``Under the Bush plan to bail out the crooked and speculative
savings and loan institutions, the people who are working every day
and paying their taxes are paying the bill,'' he said. ``Under our
plan, the corporations, the banks and very upper income people ...
would pay the bill.''
   Jonathan Brown, director of the Nader group BankWatch, advocated
restructuring the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks, owned by the
S&amp;L industry but created by Congress in the 1930s to borrow money
from Wall Street investors at low government rates and pass on the
money to S&amp;Ls.
   Brown said the boards of the regional banks should be appointed
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, rather than
elected by S&amp;Ls. He said S&amp;Ls should be required to lend part of the
money advanced by the regional banks for low income housing and
neighborhood redevelopment.
   ``This is a cash-generating machine which has been appropriated
for private purposes and is not pursuing its public housing
mandate,'' Brown said.
   The Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group representing
about 900 banks and S&amp;Ls, rejected the proposal as ``massive social
engineering which will be so burdensome as to prevent the S&amp;L
industry from ever recovering.'' The bankers said Bush's plan
rescues depositors, not S&amp;L owners.

<HEAD>Long-Distance Rates Drop as Local Charges Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. plans to
drop its rates for basic interstate long-distance service by an
average 1.6 percent on April 1, for a total annual savings to
customers of $533 million.
   A consumer advocate complained, however, that for the cuts such
heavy-use periods as nights and weekends were insignificant.
   The rate cut, which is subject to approval by the Federal
Communications Commission, would be the eighth price reduction since
AT&amp;T shed its local operating companies in 1984. Since that time,
AT&amp;T long-distance rates have dropped more than 39 percent, the
company said Wednesday.
   The proposed rate reduction reflects lower costs for connecting
to local telephone networks. Those costs will drop April 1 when the
charge residential and small business customers pay to maintain
local phone network _ the so-called subscriber line charge _ rises
30 cents per month to $3.50.
   With customers paying more of the costs to maintain the local
network, long-distance companies have had to pay less. The FCC has
required AT&amp;T, the largest long-distance company and the only one
subject to federal rate regulation, to pass along these savings to
customers by lowering rates.
   But while most long-distance rates would go down under the new
proposal, prices for basic long-distance calls under 292 miles would
increase an average of 4.7 percent _ a little less than a penny a
minute. Such calls account for about one-third of AT&amp;T's interstate
traffic.
   Also, daytime price cuts would be larger than evening price cuts,
and night-weekend prices would not change.
   Dave Thompson, a spokesman for the rival MCI Communications
Corp., said the company had not had a chance to study AT&amp;T's
proposal thoroughly, ``But, as usual, we plan to remain competitive
with AT&amp;T.''
   Janis Langley, a spokeswoman at another competitor, US Sprint,
said: ``In the past we have followed suit, and I anticipate that we
will do that in this issue also. Those reductions affect us in a
slightly different way, but we will pass on whatever is appropriate
(to our customers).''
   Gene Kimmelman, legislative director for the Consumer Federation
of America, complained that AT&amp;T was not cutting prices
signigicantly in the heavily used night and weekend long-distance
time periods.
   ``It's unfair that consumers have to pay 30 cents more on their
local bill without receiving any rate reduction for the
long-distance service they use most,'' Kimmelman said in an
interview.
   He said the price cut plan bodes ill for customers if AT&amp;T is
given more flexibility to set prices, as has been proposed by FCC
Chairman Dennis R. Patrick.
   ``If this is a sign of what AT&amp;T does when given pricing
flexibility, it means that less regulation will deny consumers the
price reductions for evening, night and weekend services they've
experienced in the last three or four years,'' Kimmelman said.
   Under AT&amp;T's proposal:
   _Basic long-distance service prices would drop an average 1.6
percent. Day prices would decrease 3.8 percent, while evening prices
would decrease 0.4 percent.
   _Rates for AT&amp;T WATS calls would drop an average 3.9 percent.
   _PRO WATS rates would drop an average 3.8 percent.
   _AT&amp;T MEGACOM WATS rates wouild drop 1.1 percent, and AT&amp;T
MEGACOM 800 prices would be 5.2 percent lower.
   _Basic AT&amp;T 800 service would drop 0.9 percent in price, while
800 Readyline service would decrease 3.3 percent. Beginning July 1,
AT&amp;T 800 service will be billed according to distance, and there
will be additional price reductions of 1.9 percent for 800 service
and 2 percent for 800 Readyline.
   _Software Defined Network Service prices will decline an average
6.1 percent.

<HEAD>Administration Relents on `Zero Tolerance' Boat Seizures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is softening its ``zero
tolerance'' policy of seizing boats where drugs are found, saying
small amounts will no longer be sufficient reason to seize
commercial fishing vessels while in operation.
   Interim guidelines, written to conform with a congressional
mandate that was attached to last November's anti-drug package, were
expected to be announced today by Coast Guard Adm. Paul Yost and
Customs Service Commissioner William von Raab, government officials
said Wednesday.
   Under the policy that began last March, federal agents were free
to seize vessels within 12 miles of the U.S. coastline if any amount
of illegal drugs was found on board.
   Recreational boat owners were furious, complaining that they
could face the loss of millions of dollars worth of property if a
crew member or guest possessed a trace of marijuana without the boat
owner's knowledge. And commercial fishermen said they could lose
their livelihoods even if they were eventually found innocent and
their vessels were returned.
   Late last year, Congress narrowly approved modifications that
would, in the words of Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, ``prevent innocent
owners of fishing vessels from being persecuted by well-meaning but
overexcited enforcement agents.''
   Congress instructed the executive branch to issue new regulations
within 60 days and then hold a 30-day public comment period. The
Bush administration already is a month late, and Customs Service
officials said they do not expect formal regulations to be proposed
for at least several weeks.
   But Yost and von Raab, in a joint announcement, are issuing
interim rules for commercial fishing boats, said officials from
their agencies, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Under the new rules, seizures of commercial fishing vessels in
operation or en route to or from fishery operations will be
prohibited if the drugs found are in ``personal use quantities.''
That is generally described as less than one gram of cocaine or
heroin and less than one ounce of marijuana.
   Instead of being immediately seized and escorted to port to await
forfeiture proceedings by the Customs Service, fishing vessel
operators will be given a summons and ordered to appear before the
agency at the completion of the fishing trip. Customs officials then
will decide whether the vessel should be forfeited or if a penalty
should be imposed.
   The joint Customs-Coast Guard announcement also outlines
expedited administrative procedures for the forfeiture process,
setting a maximum 20-day period for a final decision.
   The announcement will not, however, detail other congressionally
mandated changes in the zero tolerance policy, including a provision
to protect innocent owners by ordering a vessel's release if owners
can prove drug offenses occurred without their knowledge or consent.

<HEAD>Book Says Bugging Devices Found in Moscow Embassy Code Rooms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The CIA is denying a report that Americans
found bugging devices in the old American Embassy in Moscow while
investigating allegations that Marine guards let the KGB into the
facility.
   Bill Baker, a spokesman for the Central Intelligence Agency, also
denied allegations that it withheld information on the discovery of
the listening devices from the State Department, which administers
the embassy.
   Both allegations were made by author Ronald Kessler in his book,
``Moscow Station,'' which expands on earlier reports that the KGB
had gained access to the embassy and the highly protected code rooms
by sexually compromising U.S. Marine guards.
   Kessler wrote that the National Security Agency, the U.S.
communications intelligence organization, discovered in 1987 that
the Soviets had put listening devices in the Communications Programs
Units, or code rooms, at U.S. diplomatic missions in Moscow and
Leningrad.
   The CIA rarely comments on espionage matters. But CIA spokesman
Baker read a statement Wednesday that ``the intelligence community
conducted a review of the evidence, and that review did not
substantiate that the CPU area of the embassy was successfully
penetrated by the Soviets.''
   Baker also denied an allegation by Kessler that the CIA and the
NSA kept the discovery secret from the State Department.
   ``That is just not so,'' said Baker. ``The State Department took
part in a damage assessment'' based on allegations that Marine
guards had allowed the KGB into secure sections of the embassy at
night.
   Baker declined to discuss previous reports that U.S. intelligence
had discovered bugging devices which transmitted information about
what was being written on typewriters in embassy offices other than
the communications room.
   Kessler said in a telephone interview from his home in Potomac,
Md., that the CIA denial was part of a continuing coverup.
   ``I think that the intelligence agencies will justify lying in
order to protect what they think is the national interest,'' he
said. ``In this case they think it is the national interest to say
that they found nothing, in order not to let the Soviets know what
the United States knows, and whether we can detect it.''
   Because of KGB penetrations, said Kessler, CIA covert activities
in Moscow have been ``totally closed down.''
   ``This wiped them out,'' said Kessler, a former newspaper
reporter. He said that intelligence sources, whom he declined to
identify by name, told him that as many as 25 Soviets were executed
in the mid-1980s on charges of spying. Ten of them were in fact CIA
agents, Kessler said.
   Possible KGB penetration of the embassy has been a matter of
public discussion for two years.
   One Marine guard at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow told American
investigators in 1987 that he had allowed Soviet agents into secure
parts of the building at night, but he later recanted the confession.
   Kessler argues in his book that the Marine, Cpl. Arnold Bracey,
was telling the truth the first time. Kessler said the KGB had
gotten into the embassy several years earlier, apparently by
sexually compromising Marine guards using Soviet women.
   The CIA was denying that Soviet listening devices had been found,
said Kessler, in part out of ``embarrassment. They would claim that
they didn't want the Soviets to find out what they learned about the
bugs.''
   He noted that U.S. intelligence officials still decline to show
pictures of bugging devices reported to have been found in a new
American embassy in Moscow, although the plans to occupy the
facility have been suspended because of the bugging.
   In the book, Kessler wrote:
   ``In August 1987, the NSA made a startling discovery. The power
line to the CPU in Moscow had been replaced. The discovery meant the
KGB could have diverted signals from cipher machines within the CPU
to the outside.
   ``Next the NSA found that eight-by-14-inch circuit boards, along
with chips the size of quarters, had been replaced in the printers.
The new components appered to be diverting uncoded signals from the
`red (uncoded) side' of the communications circuits to the power
line, bypassing electronic filters that were supposed to trap any
signals inside. In September 1987, NSA found similar sinister
devices in the CPU from Leningrad.''

<HEAD>DOT Considering Petition To Overturn Burnley On Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley
says an ethics official let him rule in a case involving Eastern Air
Lines even though he was negotiating at the time for jobs with law
firms linked to the company.
   The issue surfaced Wednesday when the Air Line Pilots Association
asked the department to reject Burnley's decision in December not to
investigate Eastern Air Lines' operations. The union claimed a
conflict of interest.
   The department said it is considering the request from the
pilots' union.
   Burnley on Wednesday called the pilots' accusations ``both
malicious and without foundation.''
   Burnley made his response in a statement released by the
Washington law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts &amp; Trowbridge which he is
joining March 1. In the statement, Burnley said he rejected the
pilots' request last year to investigate Eastern only after the
department's chief ethical officer ``assured me in writing that I
was not disqualified from participating in the matter.''
   A Dec. 13 Transportation Department memorandum from ethics
officer Rosalind A. Knapp to Burnley regarding the airline pilots'
request says, ``You are not disqualified from particiapting in this
matter.''
   ``I made each decision based on my best judgment of the merits of
each matter as set out in the record before me,'' Burnley said.
   He said no one at Shaw Pittman or any other firm he was
considering communicated with him about the pilots' petition and no
one at the firms represented ``any of the parties in the
proceedings.''
   Documents show that Burnley last Nov. 22 disqualified himself
from matters involving Shaw Pittman and the firm of Patton, Boggs &amp;
Blow, whose partner Thomas Hale Boggs Jr. sits on Eastern's board.
   The Washington Post on Tuesday quoted Shaw Pittman partner
Stephen Potts as saying the firm gave Burnley a list of cases it was
handling for Eastern and Continental, both owned by Texas Air, but
Potts said the firm was not handling the matter involving the pilots.
   Transportation Department spokesman Hal Paris said the department
would consider the pilots' petition to overturn Burnley's action,
but Paris said he did not know when a decision would be made.
   A department statement said the petition for reconsideration
would be considered ``in the normal course.'' It noted that the law
firm Burnley is joining had requested and was being provided
documents related to the matter.
   The pilots asked the department to reconsider Burnley's refusal
to conduct a ``continuing fitness'' investigation of Eastern to see
that the airline remains financially viable.
   Burnley, in rejecting the original petition, accused the union of
trying to put pressure on Eastern by raising new safety concerns.
   The pilots' petition for reconsideration said that Burnley
overrode normal agency procedures in rejecting the petition himself
rather than letting it be handled by an assistant secretary.
   The filing said Burnley's actions ``strongly suggest a lack of
complete independence or impartiality and an eye cocked towards
subsequent private employment.''
   It accused Burnley of violating the department's ethics rules,
which prohibit officials from engaging in actions that would benefit
or would appear to benefit their own financial interests or those of
prospective employers.
   The original pilots union petition accused Eastern and Texas Air
of threatening Eastern's financial viability by ``downsizing,''
including the planned sale of Eastern's lucrative shuttle operations
to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump. That sale has received
Transportation Department approval but has not yet been approved by
the Federal Aviation Administration.

   The Federal Election Commission has cited Jesse
Jackson and an obscure presidential candidate for failing to file
campaign finance reports at the end of the year, a commission
spokesman said.
   A couple of Jackson's Democratic presidential campaign committees
filed reports last fall but did not file their final reports for the
year, according to FEC records.
   The other candidate, Republican Ben Fernandez, did not file
reports all year, according to the records.
   Frank Watkins, a Jackson aide, said he was unaware of a problem
in filing the reports.
   ``I don't know anything about it but I'll check on it and try to
find out what the facts are,'' he said.
   Scott Moxley, a spokesman for the FEC, said being cited for
failure to file carries no penalty unless the commission decides to
impose one.

   The Dan Quayle family is now sleeping under the
roof of the official vice presidential residence, but they won't be
fully settled until the mansion is remodeled.
   The remodeling is designed to make the three-story Victorian
house convenient for a family with three children and an arthritic
dog, said Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith.
   The changes include reconfiguring the children's bedrooms on the
third floor, and adding a bathroom, family room and laundry room on
that floor.
   While Mrs. Quayle says she intends to do the children's laundry
herself, there is a staff of stewards to cook and serve food at the
house on the sprawling grounds of the Naval Observatory in Northwest
Washington.
   Work on the residence has not started yet because private
efforts, spearheaded by friends of the Quayles, are being worked out
to raise money for the refurbishing. Beckwith said he didn't know
how much it would cost.
   But in the week since they moved in, the Quayles have broken in
the new place with a slumber party and video night for the kids.
   Each of the children _ Tucker, 14, Benjamin, 12, and Corinne, 10
_ had a friend stay over last Saturday night.
   Quayle admitted to his press secretary that he had been somewhat
lax in his mission when he accompanied Tucker to the video store,
with instructions to supervise selection of the evening's
entertainment.
   Mrs. Quayle said they should get only two videos.
   ``I guess I didn't do a very good job of supervising because he
got away with four,'' Quayle told Beckwith, adding that he stood in
line for 10 minutes to return them Sunday night.
   On the bill _ ``Moonstruck,'' ``Vice Versa,'' ``Throw Momma From
the Train,'' and ``Planes Trains and Automobiles.''
   Beckwith said that for the Quayles' purposes the house is ``very
spacious. It's just not configured for a family with children at the
moment.''
   Tucker will finish out this year at Langley High School, where he
is in the ninth grade and a member of the basketball team. The
school is near the McLean, Va., house where the family lived when
Quayle was a senator.
   The other two children have switched to private schools in
Washington.

<HEAD>Soviet Economist Says Health Case Spending Will Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Soviet economist says his government
will fulfill its pledge to nearly double health care spending
despite revelations that the state budget is running a severe
deficit.
   ``We intend to reduce the deficit, but not at the cost of
reducing social investment,'' said Abel Aganbegyan, one of the
foremost proponents of the reforms being pushed by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Aganbegyan, secretary of the economics section of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, said in a speech Wednesday that the Kremlin
will meet a promise by Soviet Health Minister Evgeny Chazov to boost
health care spending. Chazov's plan is to increase that spending
from 100 billion rubles, $166 billion at current exchange rates, to
190 billion rubles, or $314 billion, for the five-year plan
beginning in January 1990.
   State investment in health care fell during the 25 years before
the reforms began in 1985, said Aganbegyan, and the reductions
caused such negative trends as a drop in the average male life
expectancy from 71 to 68 years. Under the Soviet socialist system,
virtually all health care is provided through state institutions.
   Murrary Feshbach, a leading U.S. expert on Soviet health and
economic issues, called the Chazov goal a ``noble one'' that is
needed to reverse deteriorating health conditions in the Soviet
Union.
   Feshbach, a professor at Georgetown University, used statistical
evidence in the 1970s to uncover the declining male life expectancy
and other health problems that are now being discussed more openly
in the Soviet press.
   As part of that openness, Soviet Finance Minister Boris I. Gostev
revealed last October that the government, which had claimed a
balanced budget since World War II, was running a $58 billion
deficit.
   Last month, another economist active in the reform campaign,
Leonid Abalkin, said that the annual deficit was actually about $165
billion, or 11 percent of the gross national output, a figure that
is similar to the U.S. measure of gross national product but
excludes personal services. By contrast, the U.S. federal deficit is
about 4 percent of GNP.
   Aganbegyan estimated the Soviet deficit at $182 billion, and said
that $60 billion was financed through bank loans and the remaining
$122 billion through assets held by Soviet savings institutions.
   Aganbegyan painted a largely optimistic picture of the Soviet
economy in a speech at the Johns Hopkins University School of
Advanced International Studies. He claimed that consumer production
has grown 10 to 15 percent since Gorbachev came to power nearly four
years ago.
   ``Of course, this is a modest beginning,'' he said. Soviet
consumer production accounts for only 30 percent of total
production, compared to 40 percent or more in Western nations.

   The White House and Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter are bickering over who will be President Bush's No.
2 official at the Agriculture Department, sources say.
   According to the sources, who demanded anonymity as a condition
of speaking, Yeutter wants Jack Parnell, California state
agricultural commissioner, or Sam Hollis, a Memphis, Tenn., cotton
warehouseman, to be his deputy secretary.
   But the sources said Wednesday that former Kentucky governor
Louie Nunn, 68, has recently become a top contender, although no
final decision has been made. They said Nunn, who was governor in
1967-71, is well known in the South and would have substantial
support in Congress.
   ``This makes sense to the politicos,'' one source said. ``After
what the South did to support Bush, it deserves a payoff at USDA.''
   Yeutter said through a spokeswoman that the reports of bickering
over the deputy's job were ``completely false'' and offered no
further comment when queried by The Associated Press.
   A White House official, who declined to be identified, also
denied there was a dispute.
   Nunn, contacted by telephone at his farm in Barren County, Ky.,
said Yeutter interviewed him ``several weeks ago'' for the deputy
secretary's job.
   ``Beyond that, I don't have any information, and any comment
would have to come from Washington,'' he said.
   Nunn was mentioned early as a possible choice for secretary of
agriculture. Bush settled instead on Yeutter, a 58-year-old
Nebraskan, who was Ronald Reagan's U.S. trade representative for 3{
years.
   One source said that Yeutter may have worked an informal deal
with Bush to remain in the cabinet for only two years, on condition
that Yeutter has a deputy trained and ready to step in when it comes
time to leave.
   The possibility of a brief hitch at USDA surfaced when Yeutter's
appointment was announced but was discounted by Bush staff people at
the time.
   According to the source, Bush was willing to accept Yeutter's bid
for an abbreviated tenure at USDA because the president felt
Yeutter's help on trade matters in the coming months and on pending
farm legislation was essential. The current 5-year farm law expires
in 1990.
   Yeutter was reluctant to remain in government after Reagan left
office, was ready to leave town quickly for the private sector and
had been interviewed for several job possibilities until Bush's
appeal that he remain.
   At least until now, Hollis and Parnell have traded places as the
lead contender for the deputy secretary's job, according to one of
the sources.
   One of Hollis' supporters for the job is Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
who says a major new farm bill should not be high on Yeutter's list
of things to do in the next couple of years.
   Parnell, who has been director of the California department of
food and agriculture since June 1, 1987, has a 4,500-acre ranch and
other business interests.
   California, the leading farm state, was the home of Richard E.
Lyng, Yeutter's predecessor, and has been using clout from a number
of powerful farm and commodity organizations to maintain White House
interest in Parnell.
   Parnell's office in Sacramento said he was away from the capital
and could not be reached. A deputy, Bob Fox, said Parnell was in
Mexico City with the governor to open a new trade office.
   There has been ``lots of speculation'' about Parnell being headed
for Washington but nothing further, Fox said.
   ``The latest we have is that there's no official notification (of
Parnell) and no official decision,'' he said.

   Contracts for two nuclear-powered aircraft
carriers helped propel Virginia into second place in Pentagon
spending by state last year, but it still lagged far behind the
perennial leader California.
   Bucking a trend of ``procurement decrease'' in 32 states in
fiscal 1988, the value of contracts awarded in Virginia rose 31
percent, the Defense Department said in a report released Wednesday.
   Virginia contractors won $10.2 billion in awards, up from $7.8
billion in fiscal 1978, when the state finished fifth. Part of the
Virginia increase came from contracts the Newport News Shipbuilding
&amp; Drydock Co. received for two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
   California contractors won $23.5 billion in awards, down 4.3
percent from the fiscal 1987 total of $24.5 billion. California is
the home of many large aerospace, computer and electronic concerns
that work on military weapon projects.
   Mississippi reported the biggest improvement, a 64.3 percent jump
from $1.5 billion to $2.4 billion.
   The information on defense spending trends was contained in a
statistical report entitled ``Prime Contract Awards by State.'' The
latest Defense Department report covers fiscal 1988, the 12-month
period that ended Sept. 30.
   Eighteen states plus the District of Columbia reported gains,
most of them small.
   Altogether, the Defense Department, the armed services and the
Army Corps of Engineers awarded contracts totaling $142.15 billion
for work in the United States in fiscal 1988, compared to $147.15
billion in fiscal 1987 and $149.3 billion in fiscal 1986.
   For 1988, the Top 10 list showed Texas in third place with
contracts totaling $9 billion, followed by New York with $7.7
billion, Massachusetts with $7.2 billion, Missouri with $5.5
billion, Florida with $5.3 billion, Ohio with $5.1 billion,
Connecticut with $4.9 billion and Maryland with $4.3 billion.
   Those are the same Top 10 as in fiscal 1987, although the
rankings changed.
   At the bottom of the list, the 10 states that benefitted the
least from Pentagon contracts were South Dakota with $53.6 million
in contracts, Wyoming with $54.6 million, Idaho with $61.5 million,
Montana with $80.1 million, North Dakota with $117.3 million,
Vermont with $121.7 million, Nevada with $206.7 million, West
Virginia with $218.5 million, Delaware with $233.3 million, and
Nebraska with $258.5 million.
   The biggest losers in fiscal 1988 were Georgia, Indiana,
Michigan, New York, Massachusetts, Arizona and Pennsylvania.
   Georgia's total dropped 54 percent to $1.6 billion, while Indiana
and Michigan each experienced 31.9 percent drops _ to $1.5 billion
for Indiana and to $1.3 billion for Michigan.
   New York suffered a 19.9 percent decline to $7.7 billion,
Massachusetts a 17 percent decline to $7.2 billion, Arizona a 17.4
percent decline to $2.65 billion and Pennsylvania a 13.9 percent
decline to $3.3 billion.

   Actress Linda Evans says she's more secure and
doubts she can ever make a man the center of her life again, thanks
in part to a 35,000-year-old spiritual guide named Ramtha.
   ``As I've become more secure and wiser, I've attracted more
secure and wiser men,'' the 46-year-old ``Dynasty'' star says in an
interview in the March issue of McCall's magazine. ``But making a
man my whole life again? God knows I once would have been thrilled
to do that. ... My relationships have become healthier as I have
less and less need.''
   Evans said she has learned to value her freedom with help from
Ramtha, who she says speaks through her close female friend and
Tacoma, Wash., neighbor, J.Z. Knight. Mrs. Knight is the psychic and
channeler mentioned in Shirley MacLaine's autobiography, ``Dancing
in the Light.''
   Evans says she ignores those who criticize her relationship with
Mrs. Knight and Ramtha, whom she says ``does not say follow me. He
says, know yourself and love yourself.''

   Guitarist Keith Richards and singer Mick
Jagger, who got little satisfaction pursuing solo careers, are
planning to reunite the Rolling Stones to record their first album
in three years and may go on the road again.
   They apparently smoothed over their differences during a recent
stay in the Caribbean, said Paul Wasserman, a spokesman for Richards.
   ``Nothing is official yet, but it looks like it's going to
happen,'' said Wasserman. ``Keith was down there. Mick was down
there. And they talked about writing some songs. They might have
even written some already.''
   The album would be the second in the group's $28 million,
four-record deal with CBS, following the 1986 album ``Dirty Work.''
The tour would be their first since the record-setting 1981 tour
that brought in $54 million in ticket sales.
   Richards, in New York working on a video for his ``Talk Is
Cheap'' album, hopes to get into the studio by month's end. The
other band members also have a clear calendar, said Wasserman.

husband of nearly two years, chiropractor Bruce Oppenheim.
   A divorce petition citing irreconcilable differences was filed
Wednesday in Superior Court here, said publicist Cheryl Kagan.
   Miss Shepherd and Oppenheim were married on March 1, 1987, and
became the parents of twins, Ariel and Zachariah, seven months later.
   Miss Shepherd, who will be 39 on Saturday, plays detective Maddie
Hayes on ABC's ``Moonlighting.'' Her film roles include ``The Last
Picture Show'' and ``Taxi Driver.''

   Former President Reagan's adopted son,
Michael, won't be prosecuted on a telephone harassment complaint
because he apologized to the man he called, a spokesman for the city
attorney's office says.
   The prosecutor suspended the misdemeanor case at the
recommendation of a hearing officer who listened to Reagan apologize
for leaving an obscenity-laced message on the telephone answering
machine of photographer Roger Sandler, said the spokesman, Mike
Qualls.
   Sandler said he accepted the decision, though he didn't believe
Reagan was truly contrite. ``My inclination is that he apologized
... so as not to be prosecuted,'' he said.
   Reagan, 43, wasn't immediately available to respond to the
announcement, said his spokesman, Dale Olson.
   The complaint against Reagan, the adopted son of Ronald Reagan
and his first wife, actress Jane Wyman, was over a Jan. 15 message
left on Sandler's answering machine.
   A dispute arose over the use of two of Sandler's pictures in
Reagan's 1988 book, ``On the Outside Looking In.'' Sandler is
seeking $1,500 in court for alleged copyright infringement because
he wasn't given photo credit and says he didn't give permission for
the photos' use.
   The message threatened to harm Sandler and ended with the words:
``I hope your ... family dies in a plane crash with you in it.''

   Bob Uecker, comic pitchman and a star of the
``Mr. Belvedere'' TV series, was resting comfortably after suffering
what his agent called ``a very mild heart attack.''
   ``He's in a hospital in Burbank but we don't want to give out the
name,'' said Deborah Miller, Uecker's agent. ``He'll be returning to
work after about four weeks' rest. The doctors said he's in
extremely good physical shape so the prognosis is excellent.''
   According to Miller, the 54-year-old former major leaguer
suffered the attack Tuesday morning at his Los Angeles area house.
Paramedics then took him to the hospital.
   ``They want him in the hospital for observation and tests, so it
will be a week, maximum, he'll be hospitalized,'' Miller said.
   Uecker, a well-known pitchman for Miller Lite beer and a
broadcaster for the Milwaukee Brewers, recently finished work on a
movie titled ``Major Leagues,'' a Paramount picture starring Tom
Berringer and Charlie Sheen, Miller said.
   ``He had just completed a very difficult, busy week,'' Miller
said. ``He taped an episode of `Mr. Belvedere,' he taped a co-host
stint on `Friday Night Videos,' he had done a `Tonight Show,' and he
had done filming on the movie.
   ``All of that was last week, so you can imagine he was worn out.''

<HEAD>De la Garza Says Proposed Cuts Would Unbalance Farm Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposal to chop nearly $2
billion in farm subsidies may imperil farm lenders and end up
costing the government more than it saves, says the chairman of the
House Agriculture Committee.
   ``Is it worth it to maybe trigger this potential crisis for the
sake of reducing for the budget, beyond what would be our obligation
in relation to all the other departments,'' says Rep. Kika de la
Garza, D-Texas.
   De la Garza complains Bush's budget for fiscal 1990 would cut
farm supports by about 10 percent, compared with cuts to other
agencies of 3 percent or 4 percent.
   A $1.9 billion cut in farm programs would directly affect
farmers' cash flow and make it harder for them to repay their loans,
de la Garza said. That would jeopardize the health of the Farm
Credit System, the Farmers Home Administration, and small,
independent farm banks.

   Eye doctors should warn their contact lens
patients that improper use of homemade salt solutions can lead to
damaged vision and even blindness, the government says.
   The Food and Drug Administration, in a warning issued Wednesday,
said the solutions are not sterile and can become contaminated with
microorganisms that can cause serious and painful eye infections.
   Homemade salt solutions, prepared by dissolving salt tablets or
capsules in water, can be used safely in heat disinfection of
contact lenses or just before heat disinfection because the high
temperature kills any germs that might be in the solution.
   The FDA said that if homemade salt solutions are used, the
solution should be prepared fresh daily and discarded after use and
the solution bottle should be sterilized in boiling water for 10
minutes at least once a week.

   Federal regulators are stepping up their
investigations of alleged safety defects involving more than 2
million General Motors cars.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that as
of Wednesday it had received 428 complaints of poor braking in GM's
A-, J-and N-body cars made in 1987 and 1988. The alleged braking
problems had resulted in 85 accidents with 29 injuries, the NHTSA
said the complaints showed.
   In the second case, the agency raised to an engineering analysis
its investigation of allegations that the doors of GM's 1987 and
1988 Chevrolet Berettas and Corsicas sometimes fall off when opened.
   NHTSA said 540,000 vehicles were involved in the investigation.
The agency had received 277 unconfirmed reports of doors falling
off, eight of which allegedly involved injury.
   In the third case, NHTSA upgraded its probe of power-steering
problems on the 1987 Pontiac Firebirds and Chevrolet Camaros.

   Some people collect stamps, others
collect coins. Torrey Tellefsen collects college degrees.
   Tellefsen, 38, says he's earned 900 to 1,000 college credit hours
at 39 colleges around the country. He has a box filled with 30
two-year associate degrees in fields including business
administration and criminal justice. At least four colleges have
awarded him bachelor's degrees.
   ``In terms of his academic record, he is the most unique person I
have ever met, or anyone has ever met,'' said Larry Hungerford,
Tellefsen's adviser at Winston-Salem State University.
   Tellefsen has yet to complete a graduate degree, but Wake Forest
University says he's a few hours short of completing a law degree;
he's working on a master's in counseling at North Carolina A&amp;T State
University; and is completing courses for a master's degree in
business at North Carolina Central University.
   His goal is to earn 12 master's degrees and at least one
doctorate, probably in education.
   ``That will be a lot more impressive,'' he said recently.
   Tellefsen says he has attended four or five colleges at the same
time in his quest for knowledge. He traces his desire to learn to
his 20s, when he worked minimum-wage jobs.
   ``A lot of guys would give me orders, and the only difference was
that they had degrees. I wanted to try to be on the same level with
these people.''
   Tellefsen supports himself on student loans and occasional
part-time jobs, and says he owes the federal government about
$49,000 that he'll have to pay back when he finally leaves school.
   ``I'll have to make sure I get a good job,'' he said.

groom were married on Valentine's Day.
   Nancy Whitehead, the groom's mother, said the couple originally

   ``She had already bought her gown and they had chosen their

   But the thought kept coming back.
   ``We didn't have time to plan a formal wedding since we wanted to
get married on Valentine's Day,'' said Whitehead, a 33-year-old mail
carrier. ``We just joked about the deer stand and the idea sort of
grew. Since we were paying for our own wedding, it was cheaper,
too.''
   It was the same stand from which the new Mrs. Whitehead bagged a
deer last year.
   ``She'd never shot a gun in her life,'' said Whitehead.

<HEAD>More Americans Dying In Nursing Homes As Hospitals Save Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are increasingly going to nursing homes
to die as hospitals discharge terminally ill patients to keep them
from running up big bills, thus helping reduce the nation's Medicare
costs, according to two reports today.
   One study, based on nationwide death statistics, suggests that
the trend results largely from new Medicare rules that pay hospitals
flat fees for taking care of the elderly. This approach gives them a
financial incentive to keep patients' hospital stays as short as
possible.
   ``What has to be said is that hospitals are in a bind because
they are being pressured by cost cutting,'' said Dr. Mark A. Sager,
who directed the study. ``Nursing homes are in a bind because nobody
wants to pay for nursing home care. Patients are in a bind because
they are in a system that does not want to provide continuity of
care and health care financing is fragmented.''
   His research showed that the number of elderly Americans dying in
nursing homes rose sharply during the 1980s, while fewer died in
hospitals.
   Sager, a physician at Dean Medical Center in Madison, Wis., said
that sending dying people to nursing homes rather than keeping them
in hospitals ``may be very appropriate and less costly.''
   ``The issue is whether nursing homes can adequately take care of
a sicker population today than they were seeing a few years ago,''
he said.
   Medicare's new system began in October 1983, paying hospitals
flat fees in advance. Hospitals get the same amount for each person
with a specific disease, regardless of whether a patient stays in
the hospital for a day or a month.
   Another report provides evidence that the strategy is saving
money.
   That study, directed by Dr. Louise B. Russell of Rutgers
University, estimated the savings to Medicare from the new payment
system and compared Medicare's projections of rising costs with what
actually happened.
   In 1980, the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the federal
government's branch that pays Medicare hospital bills, predicted
that it would be spending about $55 billion by 1990. Instead, it
appears the actual expense by then will be $43 billion in 1980
dollars.
   The savings will amount to $12 billion in 1980 dollars or $18
billion in 1990 dollars. The researchers said this means the new
payment program will be responsible for a 3 percent reduction in the
nation's total health care bill, which is expected to be $650
billion in 1990.
   Both studies were published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Sager's study found that in 1981, 65 percent of all deaths among
people older than 65 occurred in hospitals. By 1985, this had fallen
to 61 percent. At the same time, the percentage of deaths in nursing
homes rose from 19 percent to 21.5 percent.
   Sager said that although he is concerned about whether nursing
homes can adequately care for their increased burden of dying
patients, there is no sign that quicker hospital discharges have
shortened people's lives.
   His study, which used mortality data from all 50 states compiled
by the National Center for Health Statistics, found that the changes
were most pronounced in the Midwest, South and West.
   He attributed that in part to the heavy concentration of health
maintenance organizations in some states in these regions.
   ``HMOs save money by reducing rates of hospitalization,'' said
Sager. ``Hospitals in high-HMO states may have already experienced
significant cost cutting'' before the Medicare program began. ``They
were much more threatened by the prospective payment system.''
   Sager's work showed that between 1983 and 1984, 35 states showed
significant declines in hospital deaths, and 33 had increases in
nursing homes deaths.
   In New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Maryland _ states that
did not participate at first in the new payment system _ there was
no change in where people died.

<TEXT>
   An out-of-bounds skier who was
buried in an avalanche that killed two companions said he had given
up hope and placed his ski pass around his neck to be identified
when his body was found.
   ``I'd given up,'' Todd Richards, 23, of Chelmsford, Mass., said
in a telephone interview Wednesday, one day after his rescue near
the Telluride ski area. ``So I prayed a little. I didn't expect
anybody to come looking for me.''
   He spoke from a hospital in Montrose, which lies between Grand
Junction and Telluride on the western slope of the Rockies. He is
recovering from frostbite, hypothermia and bruises sustained in the
avalanche.
   Richards was found by a dozen local skiers who had been coming
down legally nearby and heard his screams for help, authorities said.
   His two companions, Anthony Vaughn Shelly, 25, of Wellington, New
Zealand, and Paul Wolford, 23, of Milwaukee, were killed in the
avalanche.
   Richards said he had resigned himself to dying and had put his
laminated employee ski pass, which he had been using to dig, around
his neck ``so it would be easy to identify me.''
   The three young men were spending the winter in Telluride, where
Richards and Shelly worked for the Telluride Ski Resort Inc. and
Wolford was employed at a local restaurant. Shelly ``was leaving
this weekend to go home,'' Richards said.
   Richards said he and Shelly were friends. He said they met
Wolford on Tuesday morning at Telluride mountain and decided to go
skiing out of bounds toward a narrow, steep, powder-filled chute.
   ``If you go backcountry, you're on your own,'' Richards said.
``We knew that. That's why I didn't expect anybody to come looking
for me.''
   About 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, the party stopped at the top of the
chute. Wolford was putting on a ski that had come off and Richards
took off his gloves to take a picture of the spectacular mountains.
   ``I saw it coming 300 or 400 feet above me,'' Richards said. ``I
turned and yelled at my friend and when I turned back, it was in my
face.
   ``It hit me like a Mack truck. It picked me up right out of my
skis. It took me down about 2,000 vertical feet including over a
cliff that had to be at least 150 feet high. But it was taking me
out as much as down. I'd have to guess 70 mph.''
   San Miguel County Sheriff Bill Masters said it appeared Shelly
and Wolford died of suffocation and multiple broken bones. He added
that Richards may be cited for illegally skiing out of bounds.
   Richards said he expects to be charged for rescue payments but is
``obviously grateful to the people who pulled me out.''
   A ski instructor who tends bar at night, Richards said he isn't
sure he will stay in Telluride.
   ``Part of my job as a ski instructor is to calm people down about
their fears,'' he said. ``I'm not sure I could do that right now. I
might have to go back East.''

   The dollar rebounded slightly against the Japanese

currency moved in a range of 126.18-126.53 yen. It had lost a total
of 2.40 yen in the previous two trading sessions.
   On the currency market, trading was light because of the West
German central bank council meeting later Thursday, said a dealer
with Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo.
   He said the dollar is unlikely to move much while there is any
chance that the Bundesbank will raise its discount or Lombard rates.
   Market players stepped off to the sidelines also because of
uncertainties over the U.S. trade figures, the dealer added.

<HEAD>Stanford Accused Of Exploiting Migrant Farm Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Impoverished migrant workers crammed into
wooden shacks on one of America's most beautiful college campuses
are at the center of a dispute over who's legally responsible for
their misery.
   On one side of the wrangle is prestigious Stanford University. On
the other is Webb Ranch, which leases 300 acres from the school and
pays the migrants wages below the poverty line to pick berries and
vegetables.
   Webb charges 75 cents out of every hour worked for rent, so the
more hours worked the higher the rent, said Reuben Serna, a
spokesman for United Stanford Workers,the union representing 1,200
maintenance workers at the school.
   The shacks are a half-mile from the center of campus and have no
heat, toilets or running water. During harvest time, they are
crowded with up to eight people who pay up to $1,600 a month for the
space, Serna said.
   The migrants have asked the United Stanford Workers to represent
them. Earlier this week the union sent university President Donald
Kennedy and the ranch a letter demanding recognition as sole
bargaining agent for the farm workers.
   Union attorney Jim Eggleston claims that Stanford, as the land's
owner, is the workers' true employer under state law and is legally
responsible ``for the shameful activity that's going on here.''
   ``There are more illegalities, more exploitation of workers, more
breaches of workers' rights in this one plot of ground right here
than we've seen in a long, long time,' he said Wednesday.
   Kennedy declined to comment on the issue, but Stanford attorney
Priscilla Wheeler said the university isn't responsible for the
employment policies of its lessees or contractors.
   ``We would, of course, be concerned if any lessee violated the
law,'' Wheeler said in a statement. ``So far as we know, Webb Ranch
has not done so. If there are issues of mistreatment, we hope they
are brought up with the state.''
   Wheeler acknowledged that the migrants sometimes work on campus
as contract workers, but said there is no basis for the union's
claim that the university is a joint employer with Webb.
   If Kennedy and Webb refuse to accept the bargaining demand by
Friday, the union plans to file a petition with the state
Agriculture Labor Relations Board that could lead to a vote by the
migrants on representation, Eggleston said.
   Union officials said Webb receives $8.50 an hour for the contract
workers, but pays them only $4.25 and pockets the rest.
   Ranch manager Stanley Webb was not available for comment, his
office said. Other ranch officials declined to comment.
   Whatever doubt remains about the migrants' legal employer, no one
denies that their poor living conditions make a striking contrast to
the campus 30 miles south of San Francisco, which covers thousands
of acres and boasts elegant Spanish-style buildings and eucalyptus
trees.
   ``I think this is a step backward in history,'' said Art Pulaski
of the San Mateo County Central Labor Council. ``It's somewhat
reminiscent of the company towns, where the employers control people
not only at work but at home after work. ... Stanford University is
acting like a Third World employer here.''
   Tibuecio Cabrera, 67, and his 58-year-old wife, Cointa Mendoza,
are among up to 90 migrants _ including as many as 20 children _ who
live in four wooden sheds with four rooms each. Only a few speak any
English or read.
   Cabrera and his wife have shivered through the winter with the
warmth of only a small electric heater and some blankets. They have
a hot plate to make tortillas, but there is no running water in
their 7-by-8-foot room. Light comes from a bare bulb dangling from a
wire tacked to a wall.
   Cabrera's last monthly pay receipt shows he worked 194 hours and
earned $824.50. But he took home $514.86 after deductions for Social
Security, unemployment tax, a $50 personal advance, rent and
utilities.
   Like the others, Cabrera received no health care, no holidays and
no vacation. He said he had to use all his savings to pay for a
stomach ailment and got no help from Webb or Stanford.
   The camp has only one portable toilet and three indoor toilets
with no partitions between them for both men and women. There is a
communal kitchen with immovable metal seats for eight. Refrigerators
are padlocked between meals.
   ``I sometimes get angry, but I have to comfort myself,'' Cabrera
said. ``What else can I do?''
   Eggleston said the migrants have long been afraid to speak out
because they were illegal aliens from Mexico, but were emboldened by
their protection under the federal amnesty program to ask his union
for representation.

   A memorial to President Kennedy on the sixth floor
of the former Texas Schoolbook Depository, from which Lee Harvey
Oswald allegedly fired the shots that killed him, will open on
Presidents Day, organizers say.
   The exhibit titled ``The Sixth Floor: John F. Kennedy and the
Memory of a Nation'' does not dwell on the 1963 assassination in its
photos, films and other items, but on the slain president's legacy,
its creators said Wednesday.
   ``This exhibit is an attempt to deal with it positively, in that
it is educational. It is objective. I think it is extremely
sensitive, and I think it is dignified,'' said Conover Hunt, the
exhibit's project director.
   The 9,000-square-foot exhibit, which opens to the public Monday,
includes 350 photographs, 30 original artifacts, a 30-minute audio
tour and six films. It was built at a cost of $1.3 million and
organized by the Dallas County Historical Foundation.
   An estimated 500,000 visitors a year will view the exhibit, which
covers Kennedy's political career, his assassination on Nov. 22,
1963, and the investigations that followed, Ms. Hunt said.
   Reporters were given a preview Wednesday of the exhibit, which is
housed in what is now the Dallas County Administration Building.
   Replicas of schoolbook boxes are stacked near the southeast
corner window from which Oswald allegedly fired the fatal shots. The
area is sealed off, but visitors will be able to look through a
glass partition and adjacent windows to Dealey Plaza and the Kennedy
motorcade route.
   ``The exhibit has extraordinarily famous photographs, taken by
some of America's most talented photographers through the years,''
Ms. Hunt said. ``We looked at thousands of visuals to select the 350
that are in this exhibit.''
   Allen Mondell of Dallas, who with his wife, Cynthia, produced and
directed the films, said one segment has the formidable task of
chronicling ``1,000 days of the Kennedy presidency in five minutes.''
   ``We did not want museum visitors, through these films, to feel
that they were in a morbid place that concerned death,'' Mondell
said. ``But we wanted to convey hope for the future _ the Kennedy
legacy.''
   All visitors will undergo a security check, using a metal
detector and X-ray machine, before entering the ground-floor
visitors' center, which was built at a cost of $2.2 million.
   ``Vandalism is a major concern in museums,'' Ms. Hunt said.
   Thousands of tourists have come to the building previously, but
could not go to the sixth floor because it was closed.
   County officials have been developing plans to convert the sixth
floor into an exhibit area since 1981, but the project was stalled
by financial problems.
   Melody Miller, a Washington spokeswoman for Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., said the Kennedy family would not comment on the exhibit.
   ``They prefer to focus on President's Kennedy's life, not his

<HEAD>Ortega Says Democratization Shows Sandinistas' Strength</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega dismissed
claims that his promise to hold free elections is insincere, telling
the nation he can now promote democracy because the Sandinistas are
strong and backed by the people.
   In a televised speech Wednesday night, Ortega also hinted that he
might run for re-election.
   At the end of a regional summit Tuesday in El Salvador, he
promised to hold presidential, legislative and municipal elections
by next February and to allow the opposition help organize them.
   The summit agreement signed by five Central American presidents
also calls for disbanding of the Contra guerrillas, most of whom are
encamped in neighboring Honduras.
   ``We'll see who is strong, who the people will vote for,'' Ortega
said. ``Whoever is afraid of this (early elections) is not
interested in peace or in the strengthening of democracy in
Nicaragua.''
   The balloting had been scheduled for November 1990.
   In Washington on Wednesday, the State Department signaled its
skepticism about free elections in Nicaragua by saying it had no
plans to lift a four-year ban on diplomatic contacts with the
leftist Sandinista government.
   Rebel leaders said they felt abandoned by the United States,
which had supported their seven-year fight to oust the Sandinistas.
   The accords left the Contras isolated diplomatically, with about
11,000 fighters and several thousand relatives in neighboring
Honduras.
   Despite vows to fight on, they ran out of ammunition and moved
into the border camps after Congress suspended military aid a year
ago. On March 23, they signed a preliminary cease-fire accord with
the Sandinistas.
   Asked by reportres what would happen if the Contras refused to
lay down their arms and relocate, Ortega said:
   ``The Contras are creating a problem for Honduras. ... You can't
force them to return to Nicaragua. But they will have to choose
between coming here, staying _ some of them _ in Honduras, or
leaving for the United States or whatever other countries are
willing to take them in.''
   One opposition leader said the Sandinistas must be watched
carefully in the elections or they'll try to cheat.
   ``President Ortega only talked with the Central American
presidents, but he still needs to talk with the Nicaraguan people,''
said Gilberto Cuadra, president of the opposition Superior Council
of Private Enterprise.
   The Sandinistas' popularity has been hurt by the state of the
economy. Inflation is at a 20,000 percent annual rate, food and
consumer goods are in short supply and at least 30,000 public
employees have just been laid off.
   The government says the war is mostly to blame for the state of
the economy, not their management of it.
   Opposition leaders said Wednesday that elections as early as next
February do not allow enough time for political parties to organize
a campaign.
   In his nationwide address, Ortega went over the points contained
in a communique he issued jointly with the presidents of El
Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica at their summit.
   He stressed his willingness to promote greater democracy and
submit elections to international observers, saying this ``shows our
political strength, which is rooted in the Nicaraguan people, the
working people, the peasants ... and every patriotic Nicaraguan.''
   Speaking to journalists afterward, he was asked if he would be
the Sandinista presidential candidate.
   ``We have to consider that re-election is no crime. Even (former
President) Reagan ... complained that it was undemocratic that he
could not run for office again,'' he said.
   Ortega was asked how he interpreted the fact that President Bush
had not publicly established his policy toward Nicaragua and the
rest of Central America: ``That fact in itself shows a different
policy.''
   Earlier, Ortega said he told the Central American presidents
``Nicaragua would not be promoting the political and economic
actions it has been promoting since the start of the year if U.S.
policy had been maintained along the lines of President Reagan.''
   Government representatives have been meeting with labor, business
and opposition parties seeking a commitment to support the
government's economic plan, one highlighted by tough austerity
measures to curb hyperinflation and increase productivity.

   A House subcommittee chairman says the Florida
Republican Party was given 18 months of free use of office space in
a building the government inherited from an insolvent savings and
loan institution.
   Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., requested an investigation Wednesday
and also asked for a formal explanation from M. Danny Wall, chairman
of he Federal Home Loan Bank Board that regulates S&amp;Ls.
   ``At a time when the American taxpayer is being called upon to
provide billions of dollars to bail out savings and loans, it is a
scandal that (officials) treat assets as personal accounts'' for use
by ``friends and cronies,'' Florio said in a letter Tuesday to Wall.
   According to a congressional source, the Republican Party of
Duvall County paid no rent from mid-1987 until it vacated the
Jacksonville building last month for 1,200 square feet of office
space.
   The building is owned by the Federal Asset Disposition
Association, an agency established by the Home Loan Bank Board to
dispose of property the government acquires in closing down or
merging insolvent S&amp;Ls, said the source, speaking on the condition
of anonymity.
   Florio, chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
commerce, consumer protection and competitiveness, specifically
asked the General Accounting if the Jacksonville arrangement
violated federal laws prohibiting the government from making
political contributions or giving away federal property.
   Gerald Carmen, FADA's president, was out of town Wednesday night
and unreachable, his wife said. But The Washington Post quoted
Carmen as saying earlier that he had not learned of the Jacksonville
arrangement until December and had ordered the GOP to vacate the
premises within a week.
   The congressional source said the subcommittee has documentation
that FADA officials in Washington had been aware for six months of
the party's rent-free use of the office space.
   Meanwhile, the bank board system through which the government
regulates and insures S&amp;Ls and sells home mortgages has donated a
total of $21,600 to a think tank named in honor of Sen. Jake Garn,
R-Utah, who co-wrote a 1982 law deregulating the industry, the Post
said.
   A report issued by the Garn Institute of Finance, which was
started in 1986 and is affiliated with the University of Utah,
showed a $6,000 contribution from the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., the Home Loan Bank Board agency that insures S&amp;L
despositors, the Post said.
   In addition, the report listed contributions totaling $5,100 from
district Federal Home Loan Banks in Cincinnati, Dallas, New York and
Atlanta and $10.6,000 from the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
(Freddie Mac) the Bank Board agency that buys and sells home
mortgages.
   Wall was quoted by the Post as saying he was unaware of the
contributions to the Garn Institute. But he dismissed their
relevancy, saying, ``What's the point?''
   Before becoming the Bank Board's chairman, Wall was a top aide to
Garn. His wife is the senator's personal secretary.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index fell today
from its latest record high as cautious investors began selling, and
the U.S. dollar rebounded moderately against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which climbed 166.59 points
to a record closing of 32,149.48 on Wednesday, gained nearly 200
more points in this morning's trading.
   But a plunge in the afternoon left the index at 32,083.58 at the
close, down 65.0 points, or 0.20 percent, from Wednesday's close.
   A Daiwa Securities dealer said the morning's sharp gain made
investors cautious in the afternoon.
   ``Participants first started selling construction issues, which
prompted the selling trend in the afternoon,'' said the dealer,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   As the index fell, he said, many investors retreated to the
sidelines to see what the West German central bank council might do
later today. There has been speculation it might raise its official
discount rate, pushing up German interest rates.
   Investors also wanted to wait for U.S. trade figures for
December, due to be released Friday in Washington, the dealer said.
   Trading was heavy, with first section volume estimated at 1.9
billion shares. In addition to construction shares, electrical and
chemical issues lost ground.
   The dollar closed at 126.33 yen, up 0.43 yen from Wednesday's
125.90-yen close. The U.S. currency opened at 126.35 yen and traded
in a range of 126.18-126.53 yen. It had dropped a total of 2.40 yen
on the previous two trading days.
   Trading was inactive as market players awaited the U.S. trade
figures, dealers said.

<HEAD>Sakharov Says He's Quitting Race for a Territorial Parliament Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov says he is
pulling out of the race for a territorial seat in the new national
legislature because he believes he should represent the Soviet
Academy of Sciences.
   The prestigious academy's governing body last month rejected
Sakharov's candidacy, a move that critics of the new electoral
system said showed entrenched Communist Party bureaucrats' advantage
in the nominating process.
   ``I feel that I am inseparably linked with the academy, of which
I have been a member 35 years,'' Sakharov said in a letter published
Wednesday in the Moscow News.
   The 67-year-old physicist, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace prize,
has been nominated to represent a Moscow district in the new
2,250-seat Congress of People's Deputies.
   But hundreds of his colleagues at the academy want him to
represent them.
   ``I have come to the conclusion that I should be a candidate
namely of the academy in the new elections or not be one at all,''
Sakharov wrote in the letter to the weekly newspaper.
   ``Therefore, I am taking the decision not to run anywhere except
the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., withdrawing my consent to
run from all territorial and national-territorial districts which
fielded my candidacy.''
   The new congress, announced in December by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, will meet annually and choose the Soviet
president and members of a new, smaller and more active sitting
parliament, or Supreme Soviet.
   A third of the deputies are to be chosen from among candidates
nominated not on the traditional basis of geographic districts but
from the party, unions, professional organizations and other
officially recognized groups.
   Candidates may not espouse views contrary to the constitution,
which enshrines the Communist Party as the leading force in society,
and there has been considerable controversy over how some of the
candidates have been chosen.
   The territorial deputies will be chosen by voters on March 26.
Deputies from public organizations will be elected at meetings of
those groups in the weeks preceding the territorial balloting.
   On Feb. 2, more than 1,000 Academy of Sciences workers rallied to
protest the organization's rejection of the candidacies of Sakharov
and several other prominent intellectuals.
   They said the academy leadership had failed to listen to the
popular will.
   In a letter accompanying Sakharov's Wednesday in Moscow News,
space scientist Roald Sagdeyev said he supported his colleague's
decision to pull out of the race and hoped the academy leadership
would reverse its decision and ``find a way'' to nominate Sakharov.
   Sagdeyev also was passed over as an academy nominee.
   Sakharov, who is currently visiting Canada, was freed from
internal exile in Gorky in December 1986.

<HEAD>Lasers Safely Remove Port-Wine Stain Birthmarks in Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children born with purple birthmarks known as
port-wine stains can be treated with lasers that erase their
blemishes without leaving scars, a report today shows.
   A review of the treatment found that it removed the birthmarks in
94 percent of cases, leaving normal-looking skin.
   The birthmarks are usually harmless and occur in about three of
every 1,000 people, often on the face.
   ``We hope to get rid of these lesions before children go to
school, where they have had severe psychological problems from
teasing and bullying,'' said Dr. Oon Tian Tan, who has worked with
the laser at the Boston University School of Medicine.
   Doctors have used similar lasers for several years to lighten the
birth marks in adults, but they could not be used in children
because they left scars.
   The latest laser can be fine-tuned so that it destroys just the
abnormal blood vessels that cause the port-wine stains. Surrounding
normal tissue is unharmed.
   In a report in the New England Journal of Medicine, Tan described
her experience with the laser in 35 children who ranged in age from
3 months to 14 years. In 33 of them, the birthmarks disappeared
completely.
   The latest approach uses a device called a flashlamp-pulsed
tunable dye laser. It was developed at Massachusetts General
Hospital and produced by Candela Laser Corp. of Wayland, Mass. The
U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it for routine use in
November 1986.
   ``When we completely cleared the patient of port-wine stain, we
got normal skin that is indistinguishable from adjacent skin with
normal pigmentation, normal texture and normal hair growth,'' Tan
said in an interview. ``The only structure that was destroyed was
the abnormal blood vessels.''
   Two of Tan's initial patients had small, isolated, depressed
scars when their skin was accidentally injured soon after the laser
treatment.
   Dr. Jerome Garden, who has also extensively used the laser in
children and adults, agreed that the treatment rarely causes scars.
But he questioned whether it produces such uniformly complete
removal of birthmarks as Tan found.
   ``I just don't feel that the amount of lightening she is getting
is the same as other people are seeing, me included,'' said Garden
of Northwestern University.
   Nonetheless, Garden said that although his results have been less
impressive than Tan's, ``the important issue is that until this
time, any laser that was used in children, especially infants, would
have a very real risk of scarring. This has diminished that risk
unbelievably, to the point that none of my patients have scarred.''
   Port-wine stain is an abnormality resulting from overgrowth of
enlarged blood vessels in the skin.
   Lasers produce intense beams of light. Their effects on the body
vary, depending on their color or wavelength. When used by skin
specialists, the new tunable dye laser produces yellow light. It
passes harmlessly through normal skin but is absorbed by anything
that is red.
   When aimed at port-wine stains, the laser selectively burns the
enlarged blood vessels.

   The detainees have threatened to starve themselves to death
unless they are freed or put on trial. More than 20 have been
hospitalized, and fears for their health have been growing.
   The hunger strike began at Diepkloof Prison on Jan. 23 and has
spread to several cities around the country.
   Many of the strikers have been held without charge since
mid-1986, when a state of emergency took effect that allowed the
government to detain people without trial.
   Ms. Satchwell's announcement came as anti-apartheid church
leaders met with Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok to seek a
resolution to the hunger strike.
   The six-member church delegation included Anglican Archbishop

<HEAD>Luck, As Much As Skill, Prevented Nuclear War In Cuban Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Kennedy's moderate response
during the Cuban missile crisis was perceived instead as ``a virtual
declaration of war'' by the Soviets, and Premier Nikita Khruschev
backed down from the brink for unexpected reasons, scholars now say.
   Newly declassified documents indicate that luck, as well as
skill, played a great role in resolving the world's last major
nuclear crisis 27 years ago, Soviet and American experts at Harvard
University said Wednesday.
   Kennedy and Khrushchev made key decisions based on serious
misperceptions and faulty intelligence, which, however, may have
helped to resolve the crisis as well as to start it, said Graham T.
Allison, dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
   ``Looking at it in retrospect, with all the new information, I
still give high marks to President Kennedy and ... also, perhaps
surprisingly, to Khrushchev, for the degree of control they tried to
exercise,'' said Allison, author of ``Essence of Decision,'' one of
the authoritative books on the crisis.
   ``But nonetheless, it is now clear that there was a great
component of good fortune. It was a combination of extraordinary
skill, extraordinary courage and equally extraordinary good luck
that permitted us to avoid catastrophe,'' he said.
   Harvard researcher James T. Blight said the documents, examined
during two recent international conferences, demonstrate that the
Soviets knew about U.S. covert operations to destabilize the Cuban
regime.
   The Soviets had put the missiles in Cuba mainly because they
believed a full-scale Marine invasion was likely, said Blight,
co-author of a new book, ``On The Brink: Americans and Soviets
Reexamine the Cuban Missile Crisis.''
   Kennedy and his advisers believed that setting up a naval
blockade was ``a relatively mild response'' to the missiles that
would help defuse the crisis by rendering an invasion unnecessary.
   ``They had no idea that the way that blockade would be perceived
in Moscow was as a prelude to an invasion and a virtual declaration
of war,'' Blight said.
   Indeed, the documents reveal that an enraged Nikita Khrushchev
ordered Soviet ships to steam through the U.S. blockade, but the
order was reversed by Anastas Mikoyan, the first deputy Soviet
premier, just hours before a military confrontation would have
occurred.
   It remains unclear whether Mikoyan circumvented the decision on
his own or obtained Khrushchev's permission to change it.
   Allison said it now appears that Khrushchev gave in partly
because he had received an urgent message from Castro, dictated from
a bunker, saying an American military attack was imminent.
   A Soviet general, Dmitri A. Volkogonov, also advised that an
attack was coming, which turned out not to be true, said Allison,
author of ``Essence of Decision,'' a classic 1971 study of the
crisis.
   The crisis flared on Oct. 15, 1962, when a high-flying American
U-2 spy plane photographed the installation of nuclear-tipped Soviet
SS-4 and SS-5 missiles in Cuba. Kennedy deliberated secretly with
his aides for a week before announcing a naval quarantine of Cuba
and a demand that the Soviets withdraw the missiles.
   The world sat glued to television sets and radios as Soviet ships
steamed toward the blockade and what seemed to be an inevitable
military confrontation. But the Soviet ships stopped short, and the
Soviets and Americans came to peaceful terms.
   The historical re-examination, organized by the Kennedy School,
included a reunion of former Kennedy advisers on Hawks Cay, Fla., in
March 1987; a conference of Soviet and American experts and
officials at Harvard in October 1987; and a second conference that
included Cuban officials last month in Moscow.
   Among the other revelations it has produced:
   _U.S. intelligence estimates of Soviet and Cuban troop strength
were way off. According to Cuban Politburo member Jorge Risquet,
270,000 troops were ready to go to war, including 42,000 Soviet
soldiers _ four times the U.S. estimate at the time.
   _Cuban leader Fidel Castro may have asked the Soviets to launch a
pre-emptive nuclear attack. Sergei Khrushchev, son of the former
Soviet leader, reportedly described Castro's request in private
conversations at the Moscow conference but has since denied he said
such a thing.
   _Soviet and Cuban leaders believed a U.S. invasion was imminent
before the missiles were installed. U.S. officials, including former
Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara and former National Security
adviser McGeorge Bundy, have said the United States had no such
plans although a recently declassified memo indicates there were
contingency plans set.
   ``In the analyses at the time and ever since, we thought the only
real reason for their putting missiles in Cuba was to put the
American homeland at risk and change the strategic balance _ and the
defense of Cuba was regarded as a kind of hoked-up piece of
propaganda,'' said Blight.

<HEAD>Children Find Baby's Skeleton Inside Mother's Mysterious Steamer
Trunk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELKRIDGE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martha C. Shields told her children when
they were young never to touch the old steamer trunk in the
basement. Before she died, however, she asked them to take care of
what was inside of it.
   Expecting to find her will when they opened the trunk Wednesday,
her son and daughter were shocked to discover the blanket-wrapped
skeleton of an infant, a Bible, a small chest and the remnants of a
baby's white dress, police said.
   The 67-year-old Elkridge woman may well have taken the secret of
the trunk's contents to her grave when she died Monday, police said.
   A police search of the house turned up no sign of a will or
anything to explain the infant's remains, state police Detective
Michael E. Davey said.
   Mrs. Shields' children, Robert, 29, and Joyce, 31, told
investigators they could remember no family discussions about an
infant brother or sister who may have died at birth or shortly
thereafter. Nor did they recall their mother ever being pregnant
while they were growing up, Davey said.
   Davey said the infant was full-term and may have been stillborn
or died soon after birth, possibly as long as 30 years ago.
   The remains were sent to the state medical examiner's office.
   Both children still live in the house. They declined to comment
to The (Baltimore) Sun on Wednesday.
   Mrs. Shields and her husband, Robert, had lived in Elkridge, a
small town about eight miles south of Baltimore, for about 20 years.
Her husband died of lung cancer while the children were young.
   Neighbors described Mrs. Shields as sometimes belligerent with
children who came on her property but so generous to squirrels that
they would come to her door for food.
   She kept a well-stocked bird feeder and often asked her neighbor
to buy nuts for her to feed the squirrels, said Peg Russell, who
lives next door.
   Neighbors said she spent much of each day listening to a police
scanner and seldom left the house. They said she had been in poor
health for several months before her death.
   ``People who had an opportunity to get to know her really liked
her,'' Ms. Russell said.

<HEAD>Chemical Structure of AIDS Virus Enzyme Found, May Lead to New Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists said today they had discovered the
three-dimensional structure of a crucial protein made by the AIDS
virus, defining a target for potential new AIDS drugs.
   The discovery will aid attempts to design drugs that block the
action of the protein, crippling the ability of the virus to spread
its infection, researchers said.
   While such a drug would not cure acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, it might keep the disease under control, said researcher
Manuel Navia.
   He and eight other scientists from the Merck Sharp and Dohme
Research Laboratories in Rahway, N.J., and West Point., Penn.,
report their discovery of the protein's structure in today's issue
of the British journal Nature.
   The accomplishment, the first time a three-dimensional structure
has been reported for any AIDS virus protein, is ``pretty
dramatic,'' commented AIDS researcher Jay Levy of the University of
California at San Francisco.
   William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston
called the finding ``an important and critical step along the
pathway to rational, anti-AIDS drug development.''
   The protein is an enzyme, which is a class of substances that
permit or speed up chemical reactions. The AIDS enzyme comes into
play as the virus makes more copies of itself.
   After the virus infects a cell, it orders the cell's
protein-making machinery to make proteins for producing new viruses.
   The proteins are manufactured in a string, like cars on a train,
and they will not function unless separated. The newly analyzed
enzyme is reponsible for cutting the proteins apart.
   If the enzyme fails to do its job, the newly produced viruses
cannot infect other cells, Navia said. So a drug that blocks the
enzyme should stop the spread of infection, he said.
   Haseltine said such a drug should also keep an infected person
from being infectious to others.
   Researchers would have to make sure that the drug would not block
similar enzymes elsewhere in a person's body, Levy said.
   The structure of the AIDS enzyme looks like a tangled string in
the general shape of an angelfish. It is formed by the joining of
two identical structures.

   Movie studios began boasting today
about their Oscar nominations, which included a torrent for ``Rain
Man'' and an overtime bonus for the hardworking Sigourney Weaver.
   ``Rain Man'' received eight nominations Wednesday and Miss Weaver
earned two in Academy Award selections that also were notable for
some prominent omissions.
   All five of the best picture nominees came at years' end. Despite
a heavy campaign to remind Academy voters, the early release ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being'' bagged no major prize, nor did
``Bull Durham,'' ``Dead Ringers'' or Clint Eastwood's ``Bird.''
   Yet the voters did remember James Edward Olmos' courageous school
teacher in ``Stand and Deliver,'' released well over a year ago.
   Miss Weaver will have Oscar voters seeing double. She was
nominated for best actress in the drama ``Gorillas in the Mist'' and
for best supporting actress in the comedy ``Working Girl.''
   ``All the Working Girls have come out on top!'' she said.
   Melanie Griffith received a best actress nomination for ``Working
Girl,'' in which she played an ambitious secretary with an imperious
boss _ Miss Weaver.
   MGM-UA, makers of top Oscar nominee ``Rain Man,'' placed national
newspaper ads touting their film's eight nominations, which included
best picture, best actor for Dustin Hoffman and best director for
Barry Levinson.
   ``We're very, very proud of our movie,'' said studio spokeswoman
Jamie Geller.
   They were eager as well. In what Geller called ``a mistake'' but
looked more like a calculated gamble, MGM-UA ran advertisements in
Wednesday morning newspapers _ printed before the nomination
announcements _ calling ``Rain Man'' an ``Academy Award Nominee.''
   20th Century Fox published new advertisements today celebrating
the success of ``Working Girl,'' which snared six nominations,
including best picture. Analysts figure that nominations can boost a
film's gross by $10 million, while a best picture Oscar can mean $20
million in extra revenues. The award ceremonies will be held in Los
Angeles on March 29.
   Some of the most popular and most widely discussed pictures of
the year were all but ignored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences.
   Steven Spielberg, whose all-time box office champion ``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial'' never landed a major Oscar, was similarly
ignored for ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' 1988's top ticket seller,
which won only technical nominations.
   ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' the year's most controversial
film, won only one nomination, for Martin Scorcese's direction.
Susan Sarandon was overlooked despite a critically acclaimed
performance in ``Bull Durham.''
   For those who did receive nominations, it was a memorable day.
   ``It's a wonderful way to wake up, really an incredible way to
wake up,'' said Martin Landau, who was awakened by a telephone call
with the news that he was nominated for his supporting role in
``Tucker: The Man and His Dream.''
   Glenn Close was told of her nomination for best actress in
``Dangerous Liaisons'' during filming of ``Immediate Family'' in
Vancouver, British Columbia.
   ``I'm deeply gratified by my nomination,'' she said. ``Making
`Dangerous Liaisons' was the best experience of my career.''
   Both ``Dangerous Liaisons'' and ``Mississippi Burning'' drew
seven nominations, despite criticism of the latter film for
rewriting the history of the civil rights movement. The two movies
were named for best picture, as were ``The Accidental Tourist'' and
``Working Girl.''
   ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' collected six nominations, as did
``Working Girl,'' including best original song for Carly Simon's
``Let The River Run.''
   Melanie Griffith said she didn't expect her ``Working Girl''
nomination and slept through the nationally televised Academy Award
announcement. She was awakened by her publicist Elliot Mintz.
   ``I'm the happiest I've ever been in my whole life,'' the actress
said. ``I am extremely grateful to God.''
   Gene Hackman, in Chicago to film ``The Package,'' said he was
awakened at his hotel room with news of his best actor nomination
for ``Mississippi Burning.''
   ``It feels good,'' he said during an appearance at DePaul
University. ``When you're given a good part, you have to do
something with it.''

   A trucker who was pursuing his girlfriend in a
spat over a Valentine's Day card slammed into a car containing two
young couples, killing all four people, authorities said.
   Dariuz Kolos, upset that his girlfriend had sped off in a taxicab
in a fit of anger after receiving his unsigned Valentine, had roared
off after her in his tractor-trailer early Wednesday, police said.
Minutes later, the 22-year-old Chicago man ran a red light and
collided with the couples' car.
   Kolos, who was not hurt, was charged with four counts of reckless
homicide, running a red light and driving too fast for conditions,
said police Lt. Jim Carroll. Kolos was driving with a suspended
license because he had failed to appear in Wyoming to pay speeding
ticket, authorities said.
   Hospital officials identified the victims as Raul Lopez, 19; Juan
M. Cantu, 17; and Dolores Moreno, 18, all of Chicago; and Patricia
Hernandez, 25, of Skokie.
   Friends and relatives said the four were close friends who spent
much of their free time together.

<HEAD>Defendant In Alleged Mass Child Molestation Trial Freed On Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raymond Buckey, one of two remaining
defendants in the McMartin Preschool child molestation trial,
expressed concern about threats and criticized news coverage of his
case after being freed on $1.5 million bail.
   Buckey, 30, refused to talk to a crowd of reporters Wednesday as
he left a downtown jail with his attorney, Danny Davis. They climbed
into a Mercedes-Benz and drove to a Chinese restaurant, where Buckey
was interviewed by television station KABC.
   Buckey, who spent more than five years in jail, said he was
worried about threats against him, his attorneys and his family.
   ``I still realize there are people out there, that as far as I'm
concerned, have gone off the deep end,'' he said.
   He further derided news coverage, saying reporters had flocked to
the trial's prosecution phase but few journalists have been
attending while the defense is presenting its case.
   ``It's discouraging to think that they won't come to hear what we
have to say, but they'll come and make a mob scene at my getting out
on bail,'' he said.
   Buckey said he has been in jail so long that ``I don't remember
emotional feelings that everybody out there takes for granted. I've
been isolated in a nightmare. ...''
   He and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 61, face 65 child
molestation and conspiracy counts stemming from alleged sexual
attacks at the family-run preschool. She has been free on bail since
1987.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders on Friday ordered Buckey
freed, although his release was delayed by paperwork involving the
real estate that had been pledged for bail.
   Pounders said he wanted Buckey's long pretrial incarceration to
end as soon as possible, but he also set several conditions for
Buckey.
   The defendant was ordered to have no contact with the alleged
victims in the case, to stay away from the seaside area southwest of
downtown where the school had operated, and to turn over his
passport and remain under 24-hour security protection.
   Buckey also was prohibited from coming in contact with anyone
younger than 14 and from drinking alcohol.
   Family friends, as well as Davis and co-counsel Dean Gits,
arranged for Buckey's bail by pledging title to real estate
properties worth twice the required bail of $1.5 million.
   The case drew national attention when it broke in 1984 with
allegations of nursery school children being raped, sodomized, then
terrorized into silence by satanic rites and animal mutilations by
teachers.

<HEAD>Gilda Radner In Fair Condition After Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Gilda Radner, an original ``Saturday
Night Live'' cast member who successfully battled ovarian cancer,
underwent surgery to correct complications of cancer treatment, a
hospital spokesman said.
   Miss Radner, 42, was listed in fair condition after the surgery
Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said hospital spokesman
Ron Wise.
   Her comic-actor husband Gene Wilder, 53, was with her in the
hospital, Wise said.
   Wise called the surgery routine and said it corrected
complications stemming from cancer treatment Miss Radner had last
year. He declined to give precise information about the
complications or the treatment.
   ``The surgery definitely wasn't related to any malignancies,''
Wise said. ``Her physicians wanted her to wait until she was feeling
good and was strong enough. She's planning a book tour soon, so she
decided to have it done before the tour.''
   Miss Radner was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1986 and
underwent nine months of chemotherapy. She also had radiation
therapy and other cancer treatments including surgery.
   The treatments proved successful and Miss Radner told a Life
magazine interviewer in 1988 that ``cancer is about the most unfunny
thing in the world. But it doesn't mean you have to die.''
   Wise said Miss Radner should be released from the hospital next
week. The actress was expected to launch her book titled ``It's
Always Something'' after her recovery.

   Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald ignored
shouted demands for a vote and halted a tribal council meeting on
whether he should go on leave in the wake of corruption allegations.
   The meeting Wednesday included more than eight hours of
discussion on whether temporary replacements should be named for
MacDonald and Vice Chairman Johnny Thompson, but MacDonald ordered
the meeting recessed until today.
   As MacDonald walked out of the meeting room, some council members
yelled ``We want to vote!''
   Afterward, about 50 council members went behind closed doors to
discuss the situation.
   A spokesman for the group, Councilman Duane ``Chilli'' Yazzie,
said MacDonald supporters and opponents would try to reach a
compromise today.
   ``We need to get Peter MacDonald to step aside,'' Yazzie said.
Thompson has not been implicated in any wrongdoing.
   The tribe on Tuesday began its annual winter meeting, which
usually lasts five to seven days. Consideration of MacDonald's
future was added to the agenda after U.S. Senate hearings this month
on Indian issues, including corruption in tribal governmnents.
   Witnesses have testified before the Senate Select Committee on
Indian Affairs that MacDonald, 60, who won his fourth four-year term
in November 1986 after four years out of office, has taken kickbacks
and demanded trips and other favors as a part of awarding contracts.
   Byron ``Bud'' Brown, a Phoenix real estate agent who helped
arrange a $33.4 million Navajo ranch purchase in July 1987 hours
after Phoenix oilman Tom Tracy paid $26.2 million for the ranch, has
been granted immunity from prosecution. He alleged MacDonald was
among those who shared Tracy's $7.2 million profit.
   The account was corroborated before the committee by McDonald's
son, Peter MacDonald Jr., also testifying under immunity.
    MacDonald has refused to answer a subpoena from the panel, which
has denied him immunity from prosecution, and has refused to discuss
the allegations with non-Indians. But he has told Navajos that the
committee pilloried him because of his belief in Indian rights, and
said the probe was a racist attempt to undermine tribal sovereignty.
   At a press briefing Wednesday in Phoenix, Sens. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., and John McCain, R-Ariz., denied the probe was racially
motivated.
   DeConcini turned aside questions of whether MacDonald would be
indicted but said material had been turned over to government
prosecutors for evaluation.
   An estimated 170,000 of the nation's 200,000 Navajos live on the
25,000-square-mile reservation, which covers much of northeastern
Arizona and sprawls into northwestern New Mexico and southeastern
Utah.

<HEAD>INS: New Measures Expected To Manage Influx Of Central Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The federal government will act soon to
reduce long lines of immigrants at a processing center in south
Texas, the government's top immigration official in the area said.
One possibility is detention.
   ``Something's got to be done to stop people from abusing the
asylum process,'' said Omer G. Sewell, director for the Immigration
and Naturalization Service's Harlingen District, where more than
100,000 Central American immigrants are expected to pass through
this year.
   More than 1,000 Central Americans, primarily from Nicaragua and
El Salvador, formed a half-mile-long line Wednesday to apply for
political asylum at the new INS processing location at the agency's
remote rural detention center southeast of Harlingen.
   It was their first chance to file for political amnesty since the
INS processing center in Harlingen was closed Friday because of
alleged health and fire code violations.
   Sewell and other INS officials contend that many seeking asylum
are here only to better themselves economically and use the asylum
process and lengthy appeals to get into the United States. Political
asylum is granted only to those fleeing persecution for political or
other reasons.
   ``I'm waiting for more direction from Washington, and I think
there's going to be some action taken to relieve this problem,''
Sewell said while taking a look at the line of immigrants outside
the minimum-security, 347-acre Port Isabel Service Processing Center.
   He declined to reveal what that action might be.
   Sewell said Tuesday that detention for the asylum-seekers while
their cases are under review is one alternative being considered.
Mario Ortiz, the INS' regional public affairs director, repeated
Wednesday that a detention camp remains a possibility.
   The INS detention center is in eastern Cameron County near the
unincorporated community of Bayview, just south of the Laguna
Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge and 15 miles northeast of
Brownsville.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela of Brownsville has said he would
rule by Monday on whether the INS can resume a policy of requiring
asylum-seekers to stay in southern Texas while their cases are
reviewed.
   The judge on Jan. 9 issued a temporary restraining order forcing
the INS to allow them to travel to their U.S. destinations after
checking in with the agency's Harlingen District.
   But Vela has said he probably would allow the INS to resume the
no-travel policy for all asylum-seekers after the restraining order
expires Monday.
   The INS originally began the travel restriction to relieve huge
backlogs of thousands of asylum cases in cities such as Miami and
Los Angeles.

   Attorneys for the Beatles and Michael
Jackson have sued to stop a video distributor from selling
videocassettes featuring the Fab Four.
   The federal lawsuit alleges that Video Wholesalers Inc. of
Neptune illegally distributed and sold several Beatles
videocassettes, including ``The Beatles at Shea Stadium,'' ``The
Beatles in Tokyo,'' ``Beatles Concert in Washington D.C.'' and ``The
Beatles in The Magical Mystery Tour.''
   Jackson owns the copyright to most Beatles songs.
   After the lawsuit was filed Wednesday, attorneys for Video
Wholesalers agreed to halt sale of the videotapes until the matter
is resolved in a hearing March 3 before U.S. District Judge Garrett
E. Brown.
   ``This case is of great importance because it is the first time
that Michael Jackson and the Beatles have come together to police
the valuable Beatles material in which they each have substantial
interests,'' said their attorney, Leonard M. Marks. ``This lawsuit
sends bootleggers and pirates of Beatles materials the clear message
that they will be sued for damages and stopped in their tracks.''
   David Saka, a director for Video Wholesalers, denied that his
company is doing anything illegal.
   ``We have complete rights for what we are doing,'' Saka said.
``We sell prerecorded videocassettes that are made by other people,
and made legally. They have not litigated against the manufacturers.
We've looked into it, and everything is in order.''
   Saka said the sale of the videotapes is not restricted by
copyright laws.
   Lyle Hough, Saka's attorney, said the agreement to temporarily
stop sales of the videotape ``is in no way an admission of guilt.''
   The complaint, filed by Jackson and three Beatles-owned concerns,
Apple Corps Ltd., Apple Films Ltd. and Subafilms, alleges that Video
Wholesalers illegally made and sold the videocassettes without
authorization.
   It charges that the company violated federal copyright laws.
   Attorneys for Jackson and the Beatles are seeking to bar the firm
permanently from selling the videocassettes. They said they also
will ask for financial damages.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   More rain was forecast in the Tennessee Valley today, but flash
flood watches have been discontinued in Kentucky, where flooding the
last few days was labeled the worst in a decade.
   Moisture continued along a stationary front that reached from
southern Texas to the mid-Atlantic coast, and flash flood watches
were posted early today for much of Arkansas, western Tennessee,
southeast Missouri, southern Illinois and portions of West Virginia.
   Between 6 and 10 inches of rain have been measured since Sunday
night in Kentucky, where the Rolling Fork River was expected to
crest at an all-time high of 18 feet above flood stage tonight. The
rain was tapering off by late Wednesday.
   In southern Ohio, 3 to 5 inches of rain had fallen since Tuesday,
and numerous roads were covered with water as streams and creeks
continued to rise.
   Arctic-type air was making a comeback across the north-central
part of the nation.
   Sub-zero temperatures were reported this morning from the upper
Great Lakes through the northern Plains into the northern Rockies.
Wind chills were in the 30 below to 45 below zero range across
eastern Montana and western North Dakota.
   Snow was reported across much of northwest Montana, and strong
gusty winds were expected to develop and bring near-blizzard
conditions. A winter storm warning was issued for northwest Montana.
   Elsewhere, warm weather was predicted again today along the
central Gulf Coast to the southern Atlantic coast and across Florida.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
south Atlantic and Gulf Coast states into Texas; rain along the
mid-Atlantic coast, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, Arkansas,
Oklahoma and the Pacific Northwest; snow in the eastern parts of
Washington and Oregon and in Idaho, the northern Rockies, the
northern Great Plains, Minnesota and upper Michigan.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 30s or 40s across much of
the nation.
   Readings were to remain between 10 below and zero degrees in
portions of Wyoming, North Dakota and northwest Minnesota; the
single digits and teens from the northern Rockies through South
Dakota and the upper Great Lakes; the 20s across the middle Missouri
Valley through the lower Great Lakes and northern New England; the
50s and 60s from the central and southern Pacific Coast region
through the southern plateau, southern and eastern Texas, the
western Tennessee Valley into the mid-Atlantic coast.
   Highs were to reach the 70s across southern Arizona, the southern
tip of Texas, southern Louisiana and the Carolinas and the 80s along
the central Gulf Coast into the southern Atlantic coast and Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 28
degrees below zero at Warroad, Minn., to 73 degrees at Key West, Fla.
   Other reports:
   _East: Atlanta 60 fair; Boston 37 cloudy; Buffalo 30 partly

<HEAD>Prosecutors Find No Police Wrongdoing in Drug Suspect's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock and bottle throwing by bystanders may
have contributed indirectly to a drug suspect's death, a prosecutor
said after eight police officers were cleared of wrongdoing in the
case.
   ``It's only common sense to think that if he received treatment
sooner, the outcome might have been different,'' Assistant State
Attorney John Skye said Wednesday.
   Skye's office announced that an investigation had determined that
the death of Edgar Allen Price, 40, was accidental and that there
was no criminal wrongdoing or negligence on the part of eight
officers involved in a violent scuffle on Feb. 1.
   Authorities said it took all eight officers to subdue the
6-foot-3, 300-pound Price following a drug purchase by undercover
agents in College Hill, a predominantly black housing development.
   The arrest triggered two days of sporadic street violence in the
neighborhood.
   Price, an ex-convict from Houston, was hogtied and placed face
down in the back seat of a police cruiser after rock and bottle
throwing erupted, authorities said. Police drove Price to a school
parking lot a couple of blocks away so paramedics could tend him out
of the path of flying debris.
   The medical examiner's office said the restraint following the
exertion of the struggle was partly responsible for Price's death.
   ``By being placed in a limited space with the head face down into
the back seat ... (and) being handcuffed and restrained, the
necessary conditions for producing an asphyxial death existed,'' Dr.
Charles Diggs, associate Hillsborough medical examiner, said in a
report released Friday.
   Police Chief Austin C. McLane defended his officers, saying they
properly restrained Price with handcuffs and leg ropes. McLane said
he was not surprised that no charges were filed.
   A police department internal review of the officers' actions has
not been completed and is not expected for a couple of weeks.

<HEAD>Consumer Reports Finds Some Condoms Wanting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer Reports called two popular models of
latex condoms ``grossly defective,'' provoking an angry reply from
the manufacturer which accused the magazine of flawed testing and a
misunderstanding of the product.
   Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said Wednesday
its testing of 16,000 condoms showed that six other models were less
reliable than desired. The tests involved filling some condoms with
water and then checking for leaks, and inflating others with air
until they burst.
   All passed government standards in the leakage test. But two
models _ LifeStyles Extra Strength with Nonoxynol-9 and LifeStyles
Nuda Plus _ had a projected failure rate of 10 percent in the
inflation test, poor enough for the magazine to rate them defective.
The government does not use that test.
   Ansell Inc., the Dothan, Ala.-maker of LifeStyles condoms,
objected to the methods used in the Consumer Union study, which was
published in the magazine's March issue.
   ``We're mad,'' said spokesman Lou Capozzi. ``We think it's a bad
study.''
   In a statement, the New York-based company said the magazine
reported on products that were voluntarily recalled, tested too few
samples of each product and otherwise used flawed testing procedures.
   ``Clearly, Consumer Reports does not understand condoms,'' it
said.
   Ansell voluntarily recalled 6 million LifeStyles Extra Strength
with Nonoxynol-9 condoms last year, Consumer Reports noted. It said
most of those it tested were from the recalled lots, and it had no
data on subsequent lots.
   It said there was no recall of the LifeStyles Nuda Plus line.
   Ansell President John Silverman said, ``We are shocked that
Consumer Reports would report negative test results on a product
they knew Ansell had voluntarily recalled six months ago.
   ``Consumer Reports knew their information was out of date, they
knew their research was flawed and they published it anyway. We
fully expect them to withdraw this erroneous report and redo the
study,'' he added.
   Six other models had a projected failure rate of 4 percent in the
inflation test, which the magazine called ``higher than we'd prefer
to see.'' They were Sheik Non-Lubricated Plain End, Ramses Sensitol
Lubricated, Pleaser Ribbed Lubricated (now called Saxon Ribbed
Lubricated), Ramses NuFORM, Mentor and LifeStyles Nuda.
   Samples of 32 other models were ranked in the most-durable
category, the magazine reported. They broke very rarely and thus
were more likely to prevent pregnancy and the spread of disease, it
said.
   The federal Food and Drug Administration tests condoms for water
leakage but does not use the inflation test. While it does not rate
condoms and did not endorse the Consumer Union study, ``basically,
we have no disagreements or problems with the study,'' said FDA
spokesman David Duarte.
   The 32 models in the study's strongest category had a projected
failure rate of 1.5 percent. Top-rated for strength were Gold Circle
Coin and LifeStyles Extra Strength Lubricated. Both were thicker
than others.
   Skin condoms, made from sheep intestine rather than latex, are
stronger than many rubber condoms, Consumer Reports said. However,
it said evidence was not conclusive that skin condoms block passage
of some viruses, and said its medical consultants advised using
latex condoms to prevent disease.
   The magazine included general advice for the use of latex
condoms, warning, for example that oil-based lubricants _ such as
Vaseline and Crisco _ break down the rubber and should not be used.
It recommended water-based lubricants such as K-Y Lubricating Jelly
and Today Personal Lubricant.

<HEAD>Astronomer Concedes Mistake On Key Piece of Evidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VALERIE MEEHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An astronomer who contends Adm. Robert E. Peary
faked his claim that he reached the North Pole in 1909 conceded
today that he misread a key piece of evidence.
   Dennis Rawlins, however, said he still believes a preponderance
of evidence indicates that Peary never reached the pole and knew it.
   The Baltimore astronomer said an investigative team commissioned
by the National Geographic Society was right in saying he had
misinterpreted a page of handwritten calculations by Peary, but said
its interpretation also was off.
   Early this month, Navigation Foundation President Thomas D.
Davies, whose organization the society hired to look into the Peary
controversy, announced that a worksheet Rawlins thought held compass
calculations actually showed time readings.
   Rawlins, who argued in a 1970 article and a 1973 book that Peary
had been off course, went further last October. He said the
worksheet he had found among Peary's papers at the National Archives
contained navigational notes proving the explorer was 121 miles away
from the pole when Peary gave up his quest.
   In his book, ``Peary at the North Pole: Fact or Fiction?''
Rawlins said Peary never got closer than 100 miles to his goal. The
astronomer said today he still believes Peary was about that far off
the mark.
   The disputed document was in an envelope that Peary's wife, Jo,
had labeled as her husband's observations at the time in 1909 when
he claimed to have been at the pole.
   Davies, a retired Navy rear admiral, said this month that three
experts had examined the document and determined the calculations
were made not in 1909, but three years earlier when Peary was about
to set off on his 1906 try for the pole.
   Rawlins said today that Davies' interpretation of the time
readings was incorrect and that they are the readings Peary made on
March 3, 1900, in Greenland just before he set out to round the
arctic island's tip.
   ``It's a part of his greatest legitimate trip,'' Rawlins said.
The astronomer said Peary had reportedly told his wife the sheet was
his most precious possession and that it is likely Peary was most
proud of his Greenland trip because it was never questioned.
   There are other pieces of evidence that indicate Peary did not
reach the pole, Rawlins said. He pointed out that the explorer did
not bring back such normal records as readings of longitude and
compass variations.
   Davies said in an interview published today in The Washington
Post that Rawlins could be right and that his group's interpretation
was tentative.
   ``We haven't seen his numbers yet, but we'll want to look at
them,'' Davies said.

<HEAD>Son Charged In Death Of Civil Rights Activist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of a longtime civil rights activist was
charged with murder after he admitted stabbing his father to death,
police said.
   Reginald Perry, 24, walked into the Seventh District police
station Wednesday afternoon, handed over a bloody butcher knife and
told officers he had just killed his father, Ivory Perry, police
said.
   ``He had the knife in his hand and laid it on the counter. He
said, `I just murdered my dad,''' Officer Willie Mae Anderson said.
   Minutes later, police found Ivory Perry, 58, at his home. He had
been stabbed three times in the chest and once in the right side. He
died later at a hospital.
   The younger Perry, said to have a history of mental illness, was
charged Wednesday with first-degree murder and armed criminal
action, police said. He was held in the police headquarters jail
Wednesday night.
   Anderson said Perry had appeared calm and had blood on his
clothing when he surrendered. She said she asked him why he had
killed his father, and he replied: ``I couldn't take it anymore. He
said he didn't care if I committed suicide, so I stabbed him.''
   The elder Perry had been active in civil rights in St. Louis for
many years and often had been involved in protest demonstrations. He
was a Democratic precinct captain for many years and was vying to
become an alderman.
   George Lipsitz, the author of a recent biography about Perry,
called him ``an ordinary person who did extraordinary things.''
   Lipsitz said Perry had paid ``extraordinary penalties'' for his
30 to 35 years of activism, including the dissolution of his
marriage.
   Perry led efforts against substandard housing and utility rate
increases and crusaded for employment and public accommodations for
blacks. He also was instrumental in getting City Hall to pass
legislation providing treatment for the victims of lead-based paint.

<HEAD>Six Injured When Student Radicals Attack U.S. Cultural Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By C.W. LIM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shouting ``Oppose Bush's visit!'',
several hundred radical students attacked a U.S. cultural center
with firebombs and steel pipes today and at least six policemen were
hurt, officials said.
   It was the third time the U.S. center in downtown Kwangju had
been attacked by radicals in less than a month.
   Witnesses said 200 to 300 students stormed the center's compound
and briefly occupied its courtyard, smashing windows and tossing
firebombs, before being driven away by police firing tear gas.
   The U.S. Embassy in Seoul reported fire damage to some furniture
and fixtures in the center's main building, which houses a public
library and distributes information about the United States.
   Embassy officials said about 20 students scaled a wall around the
compound and forced their way into the building, but no staff
members inside were hurt.
   ``Drive out Yankees!'' and ``Oppose Bush's visit!'' witnesses
quoted the protesters as shouting.
   Kwangju, an opposition stronghold, is 180 miles southwest of
Seoul, where President Bush is to stop over on Feb. 27 on his way
back to Washington after attending Japanese Emperor Hirohito's
funeral and visiting China.
   The attack came despite a warning by the government that any
violence in anti-government protests would be strongly opposed.
   After about 15,000 militant farmers rioted in Seoul on Monday,
burning cars and buildings, President Roh Tae-woo chided police for
not taking a strong stand on violence, saying, ``I have endured
enough.''
   The Kwangju cultural center is a favored attack site for radical
students. Radicals have attacked the center 28 times since 1980 _
six times last year.
   On Wednesday, Gerald McLoughlin, director of the Kwangju cultural
center, was quoted as telling local reporters that the United States
may move the center to an outlying area of Kwangju to protect its
facility and staff.
   Several weeks ago, the United States said it was considering
closing the center because of the repeated attacks and concern for
the safety of its staff.
   A spokesman for the students, all from Kwangju's Chonnam
University, demanded in a telephone interview with The Associated
Press that Bush cancel the Korea trip. He said the visit is designed
to bolster eroding support for the Roh government.
   ``The United States must stop meddling in our affairs and close
its cultural center here,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, groups of 100 to 200 radical students set fire to
two police substations and fought running street battles with riot
police in Kwangju to oppose Roh's visit to the city.
   Anti-government and anti-U.S. sentiment is relatively high in
Kwangju because of the bloody military suppression of a
pro-democracy civil uprising there in 1980. By official count, about
200 people were killed in the uprising, but dissident groups claim
the toll was much higher.
   Many opposition and dissident figures claim the United States
shared responsibility for the bloodbath in Kwangju by condoning the
government's plan to quell the uprising. The United States has
denied the charge.
   In leaflets scattered around the Kwangju cultural center,
students also demanded the fall of Roh's government and an end to
annual U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises.
   Dissidents have claimed the exercises, named ``Team Spirit,'' are
blocking dialogue with Communist North Korea.

   A respected alderman withdrew from the Democratic
mayoral primary in a move that could tighten the already narrowing
race between Mayor Eugene Sawyer and State's Attorney Richard M.
Daley.
   ``I would say right now this is a dead heat,'' Sawyer said
shortly after Alderman Lawrence Bloom announced his withdrawal
Wednesday.
   Bloom, a South Side alderman who campaigned on the theme of
racial unity, said it had become clear he lacked the money to
finance a competitive campaign for the Feb. 28 primary. He said he
would campaign for Sawyer.
   Daley said he wasn't surprised by Bloom's withdrawal or his
endorsement of Sawyer, who was elected acting mayor by the City
Council in December 1987 shortly after Harold Washington, the city's
first black mayor, died.
   Daley, the son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, said he
expects to get half of the votes that would have gone to Bloom.
   However, polls have indicated that most of Bloom's supporters
considered Sawyer their second choice.
   A Daily Southtown Economist-WBBM-TV poll taken last week showed
Daley supported by 43 percent of those surveyed, Sawyer by 33
percent and Bloom by 11 percent. Twelve percent expressed no
preference.
   The 10 percentage points between Daley and Sawyer marks a
narrowing of Daley's 14-point edge a month earlier.
   The poll, which has a margin of error of 4 percentage points,
shows a virtual dead heat if a rumored write-in campaign on the
Republican ticket for former Alderman Edward Vrdolyak were to
materialize.
   The survey indicates Vrdolyak would draw enough votes away from
Daley to give the state's attorney a 1 percentage point lead over
Sawyer, 39 percent to 38 percent, a lead rendered meaningless by the
poll's margin of error.
   Sawyer spokesman Larry Horist said the mayor can expect to get
the vast majority of the Bloom vote, particularly with Bloom and his
staff joining the Sawyer campaign.
   ``Bloom is a very respected alderman,'' said Horist. ``He's going
to have an influence with both the undecided voters and those who
might be leaning to Daley but who might be soft.''
   Daley's staff contends otherwise.
   Marj Halperin, a spokeswoman for the county prosecutor, said she
doubts Bloom's endorsement will mean much because he has been
sympathetic toward Sawyer all along.
   Nonetheless, she said, Daley sees the race getting tighter in the
remaining week and a half.
   Bloom's withdrawal came a day after financial campaign statements
were filed showing he had raised $228,000, compared with about $3
million for each of the two other major candidates.
   The alderman had said throughout the campaign that he was in the
race to stay, though he hedged by reserving the right to change his
mind.
   The winner of the primary will take on the GOP candidate and
Alderman Timothy Evans, a third-party candidate, in the April 4
general election to complete the last two years of Washington's
second term.

<HEAD>Pontiac School District Discontinuing `Timeout Boxes'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PONTIAC, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A watchdog group that criticized the use of
``timeout boxes'' to punish unruly special-education students says a
decision to end their use is a step in the right direction but more
needs to be done.
   Michelle Hall-Bolden, a spokeswoman for the Champaign, Ill.-based
Protection and Advocacy Inc., said officials of Pontiac's elementary
school district still plan to use such discipline by isolating
pupils in small rooms.
   ``I'd like to see the school district look at other alternatives
besides timeout,'' she said.
   School Superintendent Wayne Krula said Wednesday that use of the
boxes to contain unruly students for brief periods has been
``regrettably discontinued.''
   ``The booths have played a very important and necessary role''
but they will no longer be used because of ``misinterpretations and
reactions,'' he said.
   The boxes, which were in place at three schools, were constructed
for timeouts because of limited classroom space, school officials
said.
   Without the boxes, the district will have to use small rooms at
Central School and Pontiac Junior High School, Krula said. When
students with behavioral disorders at Washington and Lincoln schools
need to calm down, they will be tranported to schools with timeout
space, he said.
   The boxes, which measure 3 feet by 3 feet and stand about 7 feet
tall, have been used in the district in this central Illinois town
of 11,000 people, for the past two years.
   The practice drew attention last month when a 12-year-old boy
broke out of the wooden box made by a janitor at Washington
Elementary School.
   His parents complained about his confinement to Protection and
Advocacy, which fights for the rights of the mentally ill and
disabled.
   Some parents threatened legal action, and The Daily Leader
newspaper here editorialized against the boxes, saying they should
not be used under any circumstances.
   School district officials have defended the boxes as a
time-honored way in which to handle youngsters without corporal
punishment.
   The State Board of Education sent an official to Pontiac to
review the boxes and a report is expected this week on their
appropriateness as a disciplinary measure.
   John Rapp, the district's special-education supervisor, said last
week the punishment was limited to three pupils, ages 10 to 12, who
were seen as a threat to teachers or other children and were
classified as behavior disorder cases by a psychologist.
   Timeouts are used only for students with behavioral disorders who
have shown ``consistently uncontrollable, aggressive behavior such
as swearing or hitting teachers,'' he said.
   Students were put into the boxes only after a series of other
disciplinary steps brought no results, Rapp said. The box was used
only as a last resort for up to 15 minutes and with a teacher or
teacher's aide present at all times, he said.

   Big dreams fueled big lottery sales
throughout New Jersey as players took their chances on a $17 million
jackpot in today's drawing, the largest in state history.
   ``I'd quit work,'' said one woman buying a ticket at the
Middlesex Food Mart in the northern New Jersey borough of Middlesex.
   ``I'd just relax,'' said another.
   ``I'd squander it all in one day,'' said a third.
   The lure of the record jackpot didn't create lines at most
lottery outlets, but shop owners said business was brisk.
   Lottery spokeswoman Sharon Southard said lottery sales usually
average about $2.5 million to $3 million for each Pick-6 drawing,
and there were only $1.3 million in sales last week when the jackpot
was at $6 million.
   But when the jackpot reached $12 million Monday, there were $9.5
million in lottery tickets sold.
   The estimated jackpot for today is the result of six consecutive
Pick-6 drawings without a top prize winner.
   The jackpot also was fueled by a big change in the odds made last
month when lottery officials increased the choice of numbers from 42
to 46. Previously, the odds of hitting the jackpot were about one in
5.2 million, but with the added numbers the odds of picking all six
numbers are one in 9.3 million.
   ``I guess everybody's dreaming about what they could do with $17
million,'' said Tony Salvo, a Federal Express driver from Trenton
who's been hearing about the lottery at every stop.
   ``I try not to think about it too much because it can consume
you,'' he added.
   But Michael Korolenko, a produce truck driver, has spent plenty
of time thinking about the lottery. Korolenko, 31, said he's been
buying tickets at each store as he makes his rounds.
   Korolenko is hoping the lottery tickets will give him an
opportunity to buy another kind of ticket.
   ``Sure, that's the way out,'' he said. ``The ticket out of New
Jersey.''

<HEAD>U.S. Tour Cancelled As Iran Puts Bounty On Author's Head</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Satanic Verses, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The author of ``The Satanic Verses'' canceled a
planned promotional tour of the United States after Iran put a $2.6
million price on his head.
   ``The current climate is not appropriate for a promotional tour
of the U.S.,'' said a statement issued Wednesday by the book's
publisher, Viking Penguin Inc.
   Viking Penguin had scheduled an 11-city U.S. tour for Salman
Rushdie, including readings at four universities. The tour was to
begin Friday to coincide with the official U.S. publication of the
book on Feb. 11. The book has been available in stores in this
country for several weeks.
   But Rushdie, who lives in London, was reported to have gone into
hiding with his wife, American novelist Marianne Wiggins, following
the Iranian threat.
   Police said seven bomb threats have been made in the past two
months to the publisher's Manhattan offices.
   The book, banned in Iran, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and
South Africa, was described as ``a dirty conspiracy'' against Islam
by the Iranian government. Six people died earlier this week in
protests against the book in Pakistan.
   Ayatollah Khomeini called for Rushdie's death and Iran on
Wednesday offered $2.6 million to any Iranian and $1 million to any
foreigner who killed the author, a Moslem born in Bombay, India.
   Paul Slovak, a Viking Penguin spokesman, said recent events in
Pakistan and India, ``combined with our understanding of threats
made against the author and those associated with'' the book's
publication led the publisher to cancel the tour.
   ``We reiterate that no offense was intended in the creation or
publication of this work,'' the publisher's statement publisher said.
   ``It is also our unalterable position that freedom of speech,
freedom to publish and freedom to read must be guaranteed
internationally,'' it added.
   Rushdie received support Tuesday from The Authors Guild, which
issued a statement saying it supports the right of all authors
everywhere to write without fear of constraint from any quarters.
   ``We are appalled by Ayatollah Khomeini's threats against Salman
Rushdie and his publishers,'' the statement said.
   Dawud Assad, president of the Council of Masajid of the United
States, called the book ``garbage'' and said he welcomed the
cancellation of the U.S. book tour.
   But Assad said it was wrong to sentence the author to death.
   ``Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance,'' he said. ``Who
knows what is really in the heart of Salman Rushdie.''
   Muslim leaders in Los Angeles and Detroit reacted similarly.
   ``I'm shocked by (Rushdie's) insensitivity, but I think calls for
his murder are absurd, absolutely absurd,'' said Khaled Abou El Fadl
of the Los Angeles-based Muslim Political Action Committee. ``I am
not even in favor of banning the book. I personally think the whole
thing was blown out of proportion.''

   A jury awarded Rock Hudson's lover $14.5
million _ $3.5 million more than he sought _ in a case that appears
to increase the legal responsibility of AIDS sufferers to tell
sexual companions of their plight.
   In what one expert called a landmark decision, the jury declared
Wednesday that Hudson engaged in ``outrageous conduct'' before his
death by withholding his AIDS diagnosis from Marc Christian so he
could continue their sexual affair.
   The settlement could go still higher. Jurors were scheduled to
return today to hear evidence and consider punitive damages against
Mark Miller, Hudson's secretary, who was found to have conspired to
keep the late actor's AIDS diagnosis a secret.
   Hudson's estate and Miller were co-defendants in the seven-week
trial in Los Angeles Superior Court, where jurors listened to
often-lurid testimony about the late star's sex life before deciding
in favor of Christian, 35.
   ``I'm very pleased, very pleased that they (the jurors) answered
the way they did on all the questions,'' Christian said, adding that
the verdict shows ``people have a duty to disclose if they have AIDS
to their lovers.''
   Aside from Hudson's fame, the case was unusual because Christian
apparently was not infected by the AIDS virus in spite of his
exposure. It is believed to be the first case of its type in which
damages were awarded to a plaintiff who had not developed physical
symptoms of AIDS.
   Christian claimed he was entitled to compensation for the
emotional distress of fearing he would get AIDS, a fatal illness
that attacks the body's immune system.
   Margaret Davis, an attorney and author of ``Lovers, Doctors &amp; The
Law,'' said the Hudson case is ``absolutely a landmark'' that will
likely encourage other lawsuits by people who are ``deceived by
promises in the dark.''
   ``The jury is telling America that you have to make full and
complete disclosure if you are aware that you have the disease,''
she said. ``You're going to think twice about it if you know you can
face big dollar damages or time in jail.''
   A spokesman for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation expressed
ambivalence about the verdict.
   ``We find it a troubling case because it places the entire burden
of safe sex on one individual and not the two,'' said the spokesman,
Steven Petrow. ``It underscores for us again the need for everyone
who engages in sexual activity to take responsibility for themselves
as well as for their partners.''
   Attorneys in the Hudson case, who are under a gag order, would
not comment on any aspect of the verdict, including how the judgment
will be apportioned or if the defendants will appeal as expected.
Appeals courts have often reduced huge awards in civil cases.
   Attorneys for the estate attempted to portray Christian as a
gigolo whose relationship with Hudson had ended when the actor
learned he had the disease. They said repeated medical tests showed
that Christian had not been infected by the AIDS virus.
   Christian's attorney pointed to sentimental love letters from
Hudson to buttress the claim that theirs was a serious affair of the
heart.
   ``I love you, my baby,'' said one of the missives.
   Although he shared Hudson's bed for two years, the aspiring
musician said he didn't learn the actor had AIDS until it was
announced to the world shortly before Hudson died in October 1985 at
age 58.
   ``I thought I was a dead man,'' Christian testified of his
reaction to the news.
   Hudson, the handsome Hollywood leading man paired on screen and
television with Doris Day, Elizabeth Taylor and Linda Evans, kept
his homosexuality a closely guarded secret until his battle with
AIDS became public knowledge.
   In a complicated verdict questionnaire, the jury answered ``Yes''
to the question: ``Did Rock Hudson engage in outrageous conduct?''
Jurors gave the same response regarding Miller.
   Christian smiled happily as the verdict was read. Miller,
Hudson's secretary and best friend, didn't react visibly to the
verdict. He alone is subject to possible punitive damages for his
actions in helping Hudson keep his secret.
   Miller said he abided by Hudson's wishes because he was a friend,
but also because he thought the affair between the two lovers had
ended.
   The jury thought otherwise. To the question, ``After Mark Miller
knew that Rock Hudson had AIDS, did Mark Miller know that plaintiff
and Rock Hudson were having sexual relations of a type that put
plaintiff at risk of acquiring AIDS?'' the panel answered, ``Yes.''
   Asked whether Miller kept the actor's secret ``to induce
plaintiff to have high-risk sexual relations with Rock Hudson,''
jurors also answered, ``Yes.''
   The 12 jurors' answers to the 37 questions were not always
unanimous, but in civil trials, only a majority of nine is needed to
reach a verdict on each question. They were unanimous on 23
decisions, all favoring Christian.
   Miller was a chief beneficiary of Hudson's estate, the value of
which was not disclosed in the actor's will when it was filed in
November 1985.

<HEAD>Bank Officials Re-Evaluate Automatic Tellers After Theft Scheme Discovered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A foiled scheme to steal $14 million from
automated teller machines has sparked concerns about the
vulnerability of the systems, particularly when an insider is
involved, officials said.
   Secret Service agents raided an apartment here 12 days ago and
broke up what the government described as a ring created by a
28-year-old computer programmer designed to obtain cash from
thousands of Bank of America accounts.
   ``There has never been an attempt like this in the history of
shared ATMs,'' said Dale D. Browning, president of Plus Systems
Inc., the nation's largest automatic teller machine network and one
of the aborted scheme's targets. ``We can certainly learn a lot from
it.''
   ``I think the potential there should be very scary for the
networks,'' said Shirley Norton, a Bank of America spokeswoman.
   ATM use has grown dramatically over the past 10 years as a means
for bank customers to access their accounts 24 hours a day. There
are more than 72,000 ATMs nationwide, and Plus Systems alone links
25,000 of the machines.
   ATM crimes have been considered minor, usually involving people
being robbed after taking money out of the machines or small thefts
by employees. But a study by the Bank Administration Institute, an
industry research organization, found that losses in 1986 nationwide
were $40 million.
   According to industry officials, the sophistication of the
criminals has increased as the number of ATMS has grown.
   Nearly $350,000 was stolen from Security Pacific National Bank in
Los Angeles in October when a special card was used to steal cash
from 300 customer accounts. That theft is the largest reported ATM
crime.
   But that figure seems small compared to the $7 million to $14
million that could have been stolen in the latest scheme, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Carolyn J. Kubota.
   Mark Allan Koenig, who had been a temporary contract employee for
GTE Information Services, a subsidiary of GTE Corp., is accused of
divising a plan to make 7,400 counterfeit ATM cards. In his
programming job he had access to secret ATM codes at dozens of
banks. His wife, sister, brother and another person also were
arrested.
   The foiled Bank of America attempt has prompted Plus Systems to
plan new steps to ensure that contractors comply with procedures to
protect secret account information, Browning said.
   ``If the security standards are implemented and enforced, there
should not be any security breach,'' he said. ``We are now
evaluating ways in which we can verify the enforcement of our
regulations.''

   A man who ran over a beloved
neighborhood duck has been ordered to do time at an animal farm, buy
a replacement duck for the owners and train it to cross the road.
   Dozens of people sent cards, letters and flowers to Joseph and
Shirley Spak after Danny the Duck's death Jan. 23.
   Danny, a Pekin duck about 9 or 10 years old, was a familiar sight
to area residents during his frequent jaunts across the road to swim
in a creek next to the fire station, his owners said.
   ``When they'd walk their dogs, they'd stop and talk to him,''
Mrs. Spak said. ``Everybody sure did love the duck.''
   Mayor Walter Ehrnfelt said he threw the book at Robert Yarsky,
20, of Strongsville, who pleaded no contest to a second-degree
misdemeanor charge of killing an animal Feb. 9.
   ``He said he didn't intentionally run the duck over,'' Ehrnfelt
said Tuesday. The mayor said Yarsky's lack of remorse during the
court appearance made him think ``it was a deliberate act.''
   Yarsky was caught because a witness copied down his license
number and reported it to police, Ehrnfelt said.
   Ehrnfelt fined Yarsky $750 plus $28 in court costs and 90 days in
jail.
   ``I suspended the 90 days based on the fact that maybe we could
help this individual learn a little bit about animals and the love
of pets,'' the mayor said.
   To avoid jail time, Yarsky has to read a book on ducks and spend
two days a week for the next two months as a volunteer at the
Burnette Animal Farm in Olmsted Township. Ehrnfelt also ordered
Yarsky to buy the Spaks another duck and train it, including how to
cross the road to the creek.
   ``I even said I would help him if necessary,'' Ehrnfelt said.
   Yarsky was not at home when telephoned for comment this morning.
His mother, Margaret, reiterated his claim that the death was an
accident.

   President Ranasinghe Premadasa's party
retained its majority in Parliament, the government announced today,
in an election marred by ethnic violence that left more than 1,000
people dead.
   The president's United National Party captured 125 of the 225
parliamentary seats, government officials announced. But it was
thwarted in its efforts to win complete control of the body with a
two-thirds majority. The governing party had held 139 of the 168
seats in the outgoing Parliament.
   The ballot-counting from Wednesday's election took place under a
21-hour nationwide curfew. Civilian movement was banned earlier
today in an effort to prevent more killings by Sinhalese extremists
and Tamil guerrillas.
   Shortly before the curfew began this morning, Sinhalese militants
shot and killed five soldiers and wounded four policemen in attacks
on army and police posts in southern and central Sri Lanka, police
said.
   At least 56 people were killed in ethnic violence on election
day, police said. About 1,000 others were slain during the five-week
campaign.
   Premadasa's party won 110 seats in direct popular balloting and
15 more under a formula calculated on the nationwide percentage, the
officials said.
   However, the opposition, led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party of
former Prime Minister Sirmavo Bandaranaike, prevented the party of
the 64-year-old president from winning the two-thirds majority it
wanted.
   Such a victory would have assured the president of sufficient
power to amend the constitution and push through measures aimed at
stopping the ethnic unrest in this Indian Ocean island.
   The Sri Lanka Freedom Party had eight and the rest were shared by
smaller parties and unattached members in the outgoing Parliament.
   Officials said the president planned an ambitious anti-poverty
program for his 16 million people and to bring an end to the ethnic
violence which has claimed more than 10,000 lives since 1983.
   Mrs. Bandaranaike's party captured 67 seats, and Tamil candidates
got 23, according to the official returns.
   The Tamil winners included 12 members of the Eelam Students
Revolutionary Organization, formerly one of the underground rebel
groups fighting for an independent homeland.
   An alliance of three leftist parties won three seats, and smaller
parties and independents took the rest.
   As the results were being announced over state-run television and
radio, troops and policemen fanned out across the nation to enforce
the curfew, setting up road blocks in the capital.
   Hundreds of Colombo residents crowded groceries and pharmacies to
stock up on essential goods after curfew hours were announced on
television this morning. The curfew was to remain in force until at
least 6 a.m. Friday.
   The United National Party held 139 of the 168 seats in the
outgoing Parliament. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party had eight and the
rest were shared by smaller parties and unattached members.
   The violence of recent years was sparked by a campaign by
minority Tamils for an independent homeland. At least 8,500 people
have been killed in the separatist war, and another 1,500 killed in
a Sinhalese backlash.
   Militants among the Sinhalese accuse the government of granting
too many concessions to the Tamils under a 1987 peace accord aimed
at ending the bloody separatist war. The peace pact failed after the
most powerful of the Tamil radical groups, the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam rejected it.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the people. The Sinhalese account
for about 75 percent. Militant Tamils claim they are discriminated
by the Sinhalese in government jobs, the army and education.

   A debt collector who fatally shot three
co-workers at a savings and loan bank before killing himself had
spent two years in a mental hospital after allegedly asking a police
officer to shoot him, a state health official says.
   Emanuel Tsegaye, 33, of Silver Spring, Md., argued with a
supervisor Wednesday, left work and returned with .38-caliber
revolver concealed in an athletic bag, police said. A fourth
employee was shot in the jaw, police said.
   Tsegaye, a native of Ethiopia, had been a collector reportedly
since October in the Visa card department of the Chevy Chase Federal
Savings Bank in this Washington suburb. The shootings began in the
seventh-floor office where he worked _ a large room in which about
75 employees are grouped and separated by six-foot partitions.
   Officer George Ludington, spokesman for the Montgomery County
police, said Tsegaye was a ``disgruntled employee'' but would not
elaborate. He said detectives were still piecing together the motive.
   The Maryland State Health Department said Tsegaye had been
released in October 1986 after spending about two years at the
Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center, a psychiatric facility in
Jessup, Md.
   Tsegaye was sent to the mental hospital after he was ruled
criminally insane following his arrest on charges of assaulting a
police officer, the spokesman, Mike Golden, said.
   ``All of the people that I have talked to about it are very
disturbed, very surprised by it ... because all indications were
that Mr. Tsegaye was doing very well,'' Golden told WUSA.
   The station said Tsegaye had originally been arrested after
approaching a Montgomery County police officer and saying, ``I want
to die, kill me,'' and then reaching for the officer's gun. He was
charged with attempted murder in that case, according to the
television report.
   A Montgomery County police official said late Wednesday the
department would not release any details about Tsegaye's background.
   The dead women were identified as: Cynthia Mitchell, 28, of
Landover, Md.; Tanya Walker, 23, of Fort Washington, Md.; and
Mahasty Agha-Khan, 29, of Silver Spring.
   Tsegaye also wounded Edward Johnson, 22, of Silver Spring, police
said. Johnson, who was shot in the jaw, was in critical condition at
Suburban Hospital after surgery.
   ``I was right next to Ed when he shot him first,'' said Dean
Abellano. ``I dived under my chair.''
   Employee Victor Walker said Tsegaye had had a fight with a male
co-worker last week and that worker might have been the target of
his anger. Others said Tsegaye also had had a disagreement Wednesday
with his female supervisor, allegedly about a personal phone call.
   But witnesses said neither of those two people was shot.
   One of the women who died was killed in the office area, and the
other two were shot in a nearby lunch room, Ludington said.
   ``I had no idea that he would flip,'' said co-worker Carla Waters.
   ``I got along with him pretty well,'' said another co-worker,
Mark Anthony Hines. ``We went on smoke breaks. From what I hear, the
people who worked with him didn't like him.''

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Groups Lash Out At Winnie Mandela</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to ADD background on Stompie, other details. No

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the country's
largest anti-apartheid groups today renounced Winnie Mandela and
accused her young bodyguards of waging a ``reign of terror'' in the
black community.
   A group of influential activists accused Mrs. Mandela, wife of
jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, of
``violating human rights ... in the name of the struggle against
apartheid.''
   It was the first public denunciation of Mrs. Mandela by the
senior leadership of the anti-apartheid movement.
   Mrs. Mandela and a group of young supporters, known as the
Mandela United soccer club, are under investigation in the death of
a teen-age black activist who disappeared after allegedly being
beaten at Mrs. Mandela's home in the Soweto township.
   Police and community leaders say the activist, Stompie Seipei,
14, led a ``children's army'' of 1,500 black children in the
Tumahole township of the Orange Free State and became a legend in
the racial unrest of 1984-87.
   He was jailed under emergency rules at age 10, the youngest of
the thousands detained, and held for 11 months.
   Two other slayings, one of a Mandela United member and the other
of a prominent anti-apartheid physician, also are being investigated
by police as part of the case.
   The police investigation is the latest in a series of
controversies in recent years that have dogged Mrs. Mandela.
   Many black activists used to call her ``Mother of the Nation,''
but Mrs. Mandela's erratic behavior and reluctance to coordinate her
actions with black leaders have alienated many supporters.
   ``Mrs. Mandela has abused the trust and confidence which she has
enjoyed over the years,'' said Murphy Morobe, a spokesman for the
banned United Democratic Front, the country's largest anti-apartheid
group.
   ``Numerous efforts have been made to reconcile the conflict
between Mrs. Mandela and the (black) community,'' he said. ``On
every occasion Mrs. Mandela has refused to cooperate and has chosen
to disregard the sentiments of the community.''
   Morobe emphasized that anti-apartheid leaders ``reaffirm our
unqualified support for our leader, Nelson Mandela, and call for his
immediate release.''
   Mandela, the country's best known black leader, has been
imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage
and plotting to overthrow the white-led government.
   Joining Morobe at the news conference were other leaders of the
United Democratic Front, prominent anti-apartheid lawyers, and
officials of the militant Congress of South African Trade Unions,
the largest black labor federation.
   Morobe noted that Mrs. Mandela has faced severe hardships, such
as being separated from her husband for 27 years, raising her two
daughters alone, living under a series harsh police restictions, and
spending 18 months in solitary confinement without charge.
   ``We pay tribute to her contribution,'' said Morobe, adding that
it had been a painful decision for black leaders to speak out
against Mrs. Mandela.
   But he said her actions repeatedly violated the principles of the
anti-apartheid movement.
   He specifically cited Mandela United a group of youths who seldom
play soccer, but have served as Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards since she
formed the team in 1986.
   ``We are outraged by the reign of terror that the team has been
associated with,'' Morobe said. ``Not only is Mrs. Mandela
associated with the team, in fact, the team is her own creation.''
   Morobe conceded that the government will use the criticism
against Mrs. Mandela as a ``propaganda point.''
   Morobe said black leaders did not seek to create a division in
the black community and called on people to distance themselves from
Mrs. Mandela ``in a dignified manner.''
   Mrs. Mandela could not immediately be reached for comment. A
woman at Mrs. Mandela's Soweto office said she was not available.
   Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, said he did not think Mandela was
aware of today's denunciation of his wife.
   Mrs. Mandela returned to Johannesburg on Wednesday after an
80-minute meeting at a prison farm near Cape Town with her husband.
After her return, police stopped the van carrying her back to Soweto
and impounded the vehicle on the highway.
   While Mrs. Mandela, her daughter and granddaughter hitched a ride
with a journalist, police took into custody a young man accompanying
her, but they later released him.
   Police Capt. Ruben Bloomberg said the van had been seized for
investigation into the slaying of Stompie, whose decomposed body was
identified in a police morgue Wednesday through fingerprints.
   ``We are outraged at Mrs. Mandela's complicity in the recent
abductions and assault of Stompie,'' Morobe said. ``Had Stompie and
his three colleagues not been abducted by Mrs. Mandela's `football
team,' he would have been alive today.''
   Mrs. Mandela had no comment about her meeting with her husband or
the controversy that has surrounded her since three youths told a
community meeting in Soweto that they had been abducted and taken to
her home, where they were beaten. They said Stompie was with them,
but had been beaten more severely, and was taken away after a couple
of days.
   The three youths, according to their attorney, said Mrs. Mandela
was involved in the events.
   She has denied being at home at the time, but has defended the
abduction, saying the three men and the teen-ager were taken from a
Methodist Church residence last month to protect them from sexual
abuse.
   The church has denied the charge.

<HEAD>Man Convicted of Cutting Park Trees to Get View of Potomac</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man was convicted of removing nearly 150 trees
on national parkland to improve his view of the Potomac River as the
jury rejected his claim that hired tree-cutters ignored his
instructions.
   The federal jury deliberated less than three hours Wednesday
before finding Isaac Fogel, a Montgomery County water bed
manufacturer, guilty of felony conversion of government property to
his personal use and a misdemeanor charge of illegally removing
trees.
   The tree cutters hacked down scores of oaks, locusts and maples
as well as several rarer ironwood and persimmon trees along the C&amp;O
Canal and Potomac adjacent to Fogel's property in February 1985.
   U.S. District Judge Joseph C. Howard set sentencing for April 17.
Fogel, 45, faces up to 11 years in prison and $350,000 in fines. He
remained free on bond pending sentencing.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David P. King contended that Fogel had
the trees chopped to improve his view of the Potomac and to increase
the value of his $1.1 million home, which he put up for sale but
never sold.
   Gary M. Ralph, who operates Suburban Tree Service in College
Park, testified that Fogel said he ``wanted all these trees cut down
to the canal'' and that he ``wanted a good view of the river.''
   But Fogel countered that Ralph had suggested removing trees on
the slope that included the park land. He said he insisted that he
only wanted trees cut down to his property line.

<HEAD>Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden Separate on Trial Basis</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 4th graf, ``Tom and ...' with previous

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Jane Fonda and her husband, state
Assemblyman Tom Hayden, will separate after 16 years of marriage
that began as a romance between two of the best-known activists of
the anti-Vietnam War movement.
   They have two children, Troy, 15, and Vanessa, 20, who is Fonda's
daughter from a previous marriage to director Roger Vadim. The
couple have lived in a large home in suburban Santa Monica and on a
ranch near Santa Barbara.
   The separation will be on a trial basis, spokesman Stephen Rivers
said Wednesday.
   ``Tom and Jane consider this separation a private matter and will
have no public comment or statement on it,'' Rivers said.
   Friends said the pair's divergent careers placed a strain on the
marriage. Hayden himself has joked: ``If Jane and I have an evening
at home alone together, it is a scheduling mistake by the staff.''
   Fonda, 51, who won best-actress Oscars for the 1971 film
``Klute'' and in 1978 for ``Coming Home,'' and Hayden, 49, a
Democrat representing coastal Santa Monica in the state Assembly,
were married in January 1973.
   In his recently published memoir, ``Reunion,'' Hayden offered
intimate glimpses of his romance with Fonda, who has become
best-known in recent years as an exercise guru whose aerobics video
tapes are best sellers.
   ``I have been a lucky man these past fifteen years. Jane Fonda is
many persons _ actress, rebel, fitness expert _ but I love her most
as the mother of Troy and Vanessa ... Like myself, she loves the
fullness of a family life she never had,'' Hayden wrote.
   Hayden, the radical young co-founder of Students for a Democratic
Society, was one of the Chicago Seven defendants acquitted of
plotting to incite a riot during the 1968 Democratic convention in
Chicago.
   Hayden and four others were convicted of individually trying to
promote a riot and he was sentenced to five years in prison, but an
appeals court overturned the riot conviction in 1972 and most of the
contempt citations were thrown out the next year.
   Fonda went to North Vietnam in 1972 and was widely criticized for
making radio broadcasts urging U.S. airmen to stop bombing and for
taking the seat of an anti-aircraft cannon. Critics called her
``Hanoi Jane'' and a traitor.
   Last summer, she went on the ABC-TV show ``20-20'' and apologized
to Vietnam veterans for the Hanoi visit but stood by her opposition
to the war.

   A mild earthquake rattled an area of
Southern California this morning, but there no reports of damage or
injuries, authorities said.
   The earthquake, which measured 3.2 on the Richter Scale of ground
motion, struck at 5:51 a.m. and was centered three miles
west-southwest of Chino, said Robert Finn, a spokesman for the
California Institute of Technology.
   Police officers in the area described the quake as a sharp jolt.
It was felt in parts of Chino, Pomona and Ontario.
   ``It was very short and sharp, there was no roll or rumble,''
Pomona police Officer Thelma Dwyer said.
   Residents called the station, but none had reported damage or
injury, she said.
   ``It was real scary. It was just a big thud,'' said Lucille
Manning of Chino, 40 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded
on a seismograph.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area.

   An American woman was shot in the head and
killed while driving her car in north Lebanon, one of her friends
said today.
   Gail Pascoe Harfoush, 38, a native of Washington, D.C., was
killed Wednesday afternoon as she drove her Mercedes-Benz from
Tripoli to the village of Burj Akkar, 25 miles away, said her
friend, Marilyn Rashka.
   Ms. Rashka, an American who lives in Beirut, said she heard about
Mrs. Harfoush's death from friends whom she declined to identify.
   She said Mrs. Harfoush was shot twice in the head and neck. Ms.
Rashka said the motive for the killing was unknown.
   The victim's husband, Abdul-Majed Harfoush, works in Washington
as a taxi driver. Mrs. Harfoush had stayed in Lebanon because she
was supervising workers building a house for the family, her friend
said.
   The couple was married 16 years ago and has three children. The
family has lived in north Lebanon for 3{ years, Ms. Rashka said.

<TEXT>
   Cambodian guerrilla leaders today
accused the Cambodian government of entering peace talks with the
``same rigid attitude'' they say has blocked settlement of the
10-year-old conflict.
   Senior officials of the Phnom Penh government and the three
factions of the resistance coalition held a 45-minute session apart
from their larger meeting with other Southeast Asian countries.
   The meeting is aimed at ending the war that began after
Soviet-armed Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978. Vietnamese
forces since have battled the guerrillas backed by China and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
   The resistance coalition issued a statement alleging the Phnom
Penh government is engaged only in a public relations exercise and
that during the private session it ``maintained the same rigid
attitude which is not conducive to a comprehensive settlement of the
Kampuchean (Cambodian) problem.''
   ``The plan proposed by the other side is tantamount to asking the
(resistance) to capitulate to a regime installed by foreign
forces,'' the statement said.
   It said a solution was possible only on the basis of a plan
proposed by resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Phnom Penh
rejected that plan even before the talks began.
   Resistance spokesman Thiounn Prasith read the statement aloud at
a news conference after a 10-minute monologue in which he railed
against Vietnam and the ``illegal'' Cambodian regime it was
``manipulating.''
   He denounced Vietnam for not allowing international supervision
of its troop withdrawal and claimed that about 20,000 Vietnamese
soldiers recently have disguised themselves in Cambodian uniforms.
   Vietnam in January said it will end its 10-year military
incursion in Cambodia by the end of September.
   Phnom Penh's representative, Hor Nam Hong, appeared at the same
news conference, insisting his side fervently desires a settlement.
   The organizer of the talks, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas, said that at the plenary session, the officials discussed
the Vietnamese withdrawal, an end to foreign military aid to the
guerrillas, and a mechanism for supervision and control of any
agreement.
   The session brought together Vietnam, its ally Laos, the Phnom
Penh government, the resistance, and the members of ASEAN: Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Brunei.
   A first round of talks, held in July, achieved no breakthroughs
but resulted in a consensus that Vietnam's withdrawal must be linked
to measures preventing the return to power of the Khmer Rouge, which
killed hundreds of thousands of people in Cambodia before Vietnam
toppled it.
   The communist Khmer Rouge is allied in the guerrilla coalition
with the forces of Sihanouk and Son Sann.
   Sihanouk, widely seen as the central figure in any future
Cambodian government, is boycotting the talks because Phnom Penh
rejected his peace plan.
   The plan included calls for dissolution of the Phnom Penh
government before a general election; introduction of an
international peace-keeping force to guarantee any settlement; and
specifics from Vietnam on its pledge to withdraw its troops from
Cambodia.

   An 11-year-old boy was in
critical condition today with severe burns suffered when a can of
hair spray he had ignited exploded in a fireball, authorities said.
   Shane William Ziegler had first- and second-degree burns on his
face and neck and burns on his arm, chest and legs, said Clay County
sheriff's Lt. Tim Martin.
   Shane, his 10-year-old brother and 14-year-old neighbor, Alan
Workman, used matches to ignite the vapor from two cans of hair
spray in the front yard of the Ziegler home Tuesday night, Martin
said.
   ``He bent down and kind of squatted and I started to walk off,
then I heard it go off,'' Workman said. ``I turned around and all I
could see was a red ball over the yard. It was about a 6-foot flame
from where he was standing.''
   With his shirt and pants on fire, Shane ran into Workman's house
and jumped into a bathtub to extinguish the flames. He was flown to
Shriners Burn Insitute in Cincinnati.

   Army troops and Christian militiamen
exchanged intermittent artillery fire today, jeopardizing a
cease-fire in their battle for control of the city's Christian zone.
   A police spokesman said the 22-hour battle between the two
Christian forces, which has killed at least 66 people and wounded
200, also caused ``colossal'' material losses amounting to
``hundreds of millions of dollars.''
   ``Many, many houses, shops and even banks have been gutted,'' he
said.
   Gunners of the Lebanese Forces militia and army units were firing
sporadically at each other's positions today in the impoverished
district of Ein Rummaneh and its surroundings.
   ``If the exchange escalates, it might shatter the cease-fire,''
said the police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The leftist newspaper As-Safir called Wednesday's fighting ``the
Maronites' black day.'' The army of the Christian-controlled
government and the Christian militia are made up mainly of Maronites
Catholics.
   The country is now led by two rival governments, one Christian
and the other Moslem. The fighting, which began Tuesday and tapered
off with a cease-fire Wednesday, further divided the Christian camp
in its nearly 14-year-old civil war against the Moslems.
   An official at the U.S. Embassy denied radio reports that
Ambassador John McCarthy has decided to evacuate Lebanon with his
entire American staff to the east Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
   ``There are no plans for us to leave,'' said the official, who
requested anonymity. He said none of the embassy's estimated 20
American staffers had been injured in the fighting, which sent a few
shells crashing 200 yards from the embassy compound in suburban
Aukar and broke windows there.
   The offices were closed Wednesday and today.
   In Wednesday's fight, the army overran militia strongholds to
control about 75 percent of the Christian enclave, police said. They
also said the army took militia positions in a central mountain
range.

<HEAD>Republican Party Fights Former Klan Leader's Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>METAIRIE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush and former President Reagan
have made highly unusual endorsements in a state House race in an
effort to defeat a former Ku Klux Klan leader who is running as a
Republican.
   In radio spots that began running today, Reagan said, ``I can't
help but tell you of the high regard I have for one candidate in the
race for your next representative, John Treen.''
   Treen faces fellow Republican David Duke in Saturday's runoff for
a seat in the state House of Representatives, representing a
district in the New Orleans suburbs. Duke was imperial wizard of the
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan until he left the group in 1980.
   Leslie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Republican National
Committee, described the endorsements by Bush and Reagan as
unprecedented for a state legislative race. The national party is
helping pay the costs and is also assigning three campaign
professionals to help Treen, she said.
   ``David Duke will embrace any political party he can get to
espouse his politics of hatred, violence and bigotry,'' Goodman said
Wednesday. ``If he's trying to say that being a racist and a bigot
is the same as being a conservative Republican, I beg to differ with
him. His background has nothing to do with mainstream American
values. It's a disgrace.''
   Letters signed by Bush, saying that Treen has a ``strong sense of
compassion for others and an abiding faith in the future of
America,'' are being mailed to voters this week, Goodman said. While
neither Bush nor Reagan mention Duke in their endorsements, the
national party's interest stems solely from Duke's background, she
said.
   Treen, also running as a Republican, finished a distant second to
Duke in the seven-way Jan. 21 primary. Under Louisiana's open
primary system, the top two vote-getters in a primary, regardless of
party, face each other in the runoff if no one candidate gets half
the primary votes.
   Duke said he is amazed that Bush and Reagan are involved in the
local election that involves only about 23,000 registered voters.
   ``The outside interference in this race is absolutely
ridiculous,'' Duke said. ``It's like the establishment is closing
the ranks to prevent an independent from coming through.''
   Treen, who was state campaign chairman for Bush's 1980
unsuccessful presidential bid, said the endorsements show ``that at
the highest levels of government, there is a genuine concern about
someone that harbors such a foreign ideology.''
   Duke claims he no longer agrees with the Klan philosophy. He
heads a group called the National Association for the Advancement of
White People, which he says is not racist but a group seeking human
rights for everybody.

<HEAD>Two Men Indicted for Using Voodoo in Attempt to Murder Circuit Judge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUPELO, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two brothers trying to get a voodoo death
curse put on a judge who sentenced one of them to prison paid $100
to an undercover agent for a portrait and what they thought was a
lock of the judge's hair, officials said.
   Leroy Ivy of Oxford and his brother John Henry Ivy of Tupelo were
indicted this month on a charge of conspiracy to murder Lee County
Circuit Judge Thomas Gardner III. The indictment was made public
Monday.
   In July, Gardner had sentenced John Henry Ivy to 40 years in
prison after Ivy pleaded guilty to two robberies of Tupelo liquor
stores. From the state penitentiary in Parchman, he conspired with
his brother to retaliate against the judge, authorities said.
   ``They tried to kill him with voodoo,'' said Lee County Sheriff
Jack Shirley. ``We've talked about it. To me, it was kind of a
joke.''
   Jerry Butler, an investigator with the Mississippi Highway
Patrol, said undercover agents discovered that someone was trying to
obtain a photo of Gardner and a lock of his hair to send to a voodoo
practitioner in Jamaica to have a hex placed on the judge. Agents
supplied a picture of Gardner and a lock of a detective's hair to
Leroy Ivy last October, he said.
   The brother paid $100 for the hair and photo, Shirley said,
adding that it was the payment of money that led to the conspiracy
charge. They had allegedly agreed to pay $1,000 to the voodoo witch
doctor, via a middleman in Louisiana.
   Contacted this week, Gardner declined to comment.
   ``I'd rather not discuss it now _ for obvious reasons,'' he said.
   Voodoo is a West African religious belief that incorporates a
number of gods. It is a national religion in Haiti and is widespread
throughout the Caribbean and in some communities in the South.

<HEAD>Fed Rejects Continental Request To Purchase Arizona Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board rejected a request by
Continental Bank Corp. in Chicago to purchase a small Arizona bank
because it said Continenal had not fulfilled its duties under a law
designed to prevent red-lining.
   The Fed said it found ``important deficiencies'' in the bank's
performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires
banks to meet local credit needs, including those of low- and
moderate-income neighborhoods.
   Continental's petition to acquire Grand Canyon State Bank in
Scottsdale, Ariz., was rejected on a 4-2 vote Wednesday, with Govs.
H. Robert Heller and John LaWare opposed. Gov. Edward W. Kelley Jr.
did not vote.
   ``The bank made no significant effort to ascertain the credit
needs of its communities or to advertise its products to the
community,'' the 10-page majority decision said. ``Finally, given
Continental's size, as well as the opportunities available in the
Chicago area, (the) bank's participation in community development
and redevelopment efforts was unsatisfactory.''
   The decision also said the bank made ``substantially inaccurate''
statements for a number of years about its compliance with the
Community Reinvestment Act.
   It noted that the bank has since developed a plan that should
``make substantial contribution to correcting the past
deficiencies'' in its compliance with the law.
   But it added: ``The board does not believe that commitments by
themselves can serve as a substitute for the established record of
CRA performance required by the statute.''
   The board also voiced concern about the bank's plan to expand
while still financed in part by and subject to the control of
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., in the wake of a 1984 federal
bailout.

   A driver who says he was distracted by
two women wearing tight T-shirts and hot pants wants the county to
repair the damage caused when he slammed into the rear end of
another car.
   Kenneth Larrison, 27, of St. Petersburg submitted a $1,900 bill
to Pinellas County to fix both his car and the car he hit on Dec. 10.
   Larrison says he took his eyes off the road to watch the women in
skimpy T-shirts and shorts standing on a median strip advertising
for a Pinellas Park tire company.
   One woman swiveled a hula hoop while the other held aloft a sign.
   Larrison argues the median strip should be free of any unusual
distractions, and he has written the county that he has seen similar
promotional gimmicks along county roads that endanger ``the property
and lives of other drivers.''
   Backing him up all the way, Larrison's fiancee Kathleen Zielinski
says her beau's eyes weren't really on the other women _ but on the
spectacle they presented by the roadside.
   The county has six months to respond to Larrison's claim for the
car-repair money, County Attorney Susan Churuti said Wednesday.
Larrison will be free to file a lawsuit if he receives no response
in that time.
   But Churuti said she doesn't buy Larrison's reasoning.
   ``Let's face it,'' she said, ``you've got to be in control of
your automobile when you're driving it.''

   A man who wanted to write a book about
traveling by freight train was found dead in a freight car,
apparently crushed by a load of lumber, police said.
   Gregory Carpenter, 26, of Eau Claire, Wis., who might have jumped
into a small open space in a freight car for warmth, was found
pinned between lumber and an end of the car by two Soo Line
employees Wednesday morning, said Sgt. Gerry Breyer.
   Carpenter, dressed in several layers of winter clothing, left
home Sunday and may have been dead for two to three days, police
said. The Ramsey County medical examiner's office was investigating
the death.
   Carpenter's possessions included a sleeping bag, a railroad atlas
of the United States, books, traveler's checks, credit cards, a list
of 60 people he planned to visit in a dozen states, and notes
indicating he hoped to write about his experiences, police said.
   ``There seems to be a growth in people who think it's glamorous''
to ride freight trains, said John Bergene, a spokesman for the Soo
Line Railroad in Minneapolis. ``What happened today is the reality.
A freight car is a dangerous environment. People can be trapped in
them, freeze to death.''
   The freight car, owned by British Columbia Railway, had come into
the railroad yard from Duluth early Saturday and was moved again
Tuesday night. It was then moved off the main tracks for repairs.
   Police said it was unclear when Carpenter got on the car and what
caused the lumber to shift.

<TEXT>
   A 4-year-old Palestinian girl died today of head
injuries suffered in a mysterious explosion, and three Palestinians
were wounded by army gunfire during protests in the occupied Gaza
Strip, Arab news reports said.
   A military source confirmed the girl's death. The army said it
was checking the other reported casualties. Since the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied lands began 14 months ago, 380 Palestinians
and 15 Israelis have been killed.
   Two aides to Finance Minister Shimon Peres, the leader of the
left-leaning Labor Party, met Wednesday night with PLO supporter
Faisal Husseini to lay the groundwork for future peace talks.
   It was the second meeting this week between Israeli legislators
and Husseini, one of the most prominent Palestinian figures in the
occupied territories.
   The meetings were criticized by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc, which accused Labor of violating a coalition
agreement that bars Israel from holding talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Likud legislator Reuven Rivlin said on Israel radio the meetings
were tantamount to holding talks with PLO chief Yasser Arafat. The
talks were ``directly with someone who thinks he represents
Arafat,'' Rivlin said.
   Avraham Burg, a parliament member and aide to Peres who attended
Wednesday's meeting, said the talks were needed to break through
psychological barriers between Israelis and Palestinians. ``We
cannot consider every Palestinian to be a terrorist and not speak to
him,'' Burg said on the radio.
   ``They (the talks) are a basis so that one day Israelis will come
and say okay so the next stage is a political dialogue,'' he said.
   The death of 4-year-old Iktimal Abdullah of Tayasir village in
the occupied West Bank came three days after she was injured when a
device she found near her home exploded, Arab reports said. Her
10-year-old brother Naim also was wounded in the blast.
   The army launched an investigation into the blast in Tayasir and
into two other Palestinian deaths linked to explosions of
unidentified devices on the West Bank. The air force also has been
asked to look into the blasts.
   Palestinian activists have charged that Israeli soldiers have
thrown explosive devices out of jeeps to lure unsuspecting children,
but the army has denied the reports. The army's deputy chief of
staff, Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, says the blasts generally have resulted
from children playing with undetonated shells near firing ranges or
with flares that fell from training jets.
   The two earlier blasts killed a 15-year-old near the village of
Kabatiya on Monday and an 8-year-old in the village of Tamoun on
Feb. 4.
   The army said the Kabatiya incidents occurred after the teen-ager
wandered onto an army training ground.
   An army spokeswoman said the military planned to take measures to
prevent such accidents in the future, but she did not elaborate.
   In the Gaza Strip today, teen-agers staged several stone-throwing
protests, Arab reports said. The reports said three youths, aged 12,
14, and 17, were shot in the legs by soldiers.

   Two jetliners came within 15 seconds of
colliding after one of the planes was rerouted because of an
electrical blackout at John Wayne Airport, a newspaper reported
today.
   The Federal Aviation Administration was investigating the near
collision Monday night involving a British Airways jumbo jet and an
American Airlines jetliner over Westminster, the Orange County
Register reported.
   Air-traffic controllers in the Los Angeles Terminal Radar
Facility at the time of the incident said the planes flew within 1{
miles horizontally and 200 feet vertically of each other. FAA
regulations mandate that planes be kept at least three miles apart
horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically.
   Controllers, whose identities were withheld because of a pending
investigation, told the newspaper that a controller in Los Angeles
spotted the potential collision just after 7 p.m. and quickly warned
the British Airways jet to turn.
   Controllers said the planes, which were flying at about 300 mph,
would have collided in about 15 seconds.
   ``There is an investigation for a possible (controller)
operational error,'' said Barbara Abels, an FAA spokeswoman in Los
Angeles.
   The planes were at an altitude of 9,000 feet, Ms. Abels said, but
she said she did not know how close the aircraft came. Neither pilot
filed a near collision report with the FAA, she said, adding that
pilots have leeway on whether to file a report
   An electrical short-circuit that blackened the main runway lights
prompted officials to close John Wayne Airport to commercial traffic
for about four hours Monday night.
   The American jet was diverted to Ontario International Airport
because of the blackout, said Jim Brown, an American spokesman in
Dallas.
   American Flight 1262 from San Jose had 66 people on board and was
being guided by controllers at the FAA's radar center at El Toro,
airline and FAA officials said.
   The British Airways Boeing 747, which can carry up to 376 people,
was departing Los Angeles International Airport for London,
according to airline departure schedules. It was being guided by Los
Angeles controllers.

   Moslem fundamentalist leaders in Iran said today
that suicide squads were preparing to carry out the ``death
sentence'' imposed on novelist Salman Rushdie and his publishers by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The declaration on Tehran Radio followed other reports that death
squads from Islamic countries were en route to Britain in search of
the writer, whose novel ``The Satanic Verses'' has outraged many
Moslem fundamentalists.
   Britain, which reopened its embassy in Tehran in December for the
first time in eight years, condemned the threats and announced it
had frozen plans to ``build up further our embassy.''
   United News of India and the British Broadcasting Corp. said
telephone callers threatened to bomb British planes to India unless
Rushdie appeared in public. Two airlines, British Airways and Air
Europe, said they were taking the threat seriously.
   The Indian news agency said a man claiming to speak for the
previously unheard of Iranian Guards telephoned its Bombay office
today with the threats.
   Pakistan's government demanded the United States and Britain ban
the book and that all copies of it be destroyed. Six people died in
Pakistan during a weekend riot over the book.
   An Iranian cleric on Wednesday offered up to $2.6 million for
Rushdie's murder, and the author canceled a U.S. promotional tour
that was scheduled to begin Friday.
   A leading Islamic theologian in Egypt said today Khomeini erred
in sending death squads after Rushdie without first giving him a
chance to repent. Sheik Mohammed Hossam-el-Din said the book should
be banned and burned, but executing its author would be ``virtually
impossible'' under the tenets of Islam.
   British news media said the Indian-born Rushdie was hiding with
his wife, American novelist Marianne Wiggins, under police guard.
Press Association, the domestic British news agency, said Rushdie's
first wife, Clarissa Luard, also had been given police protection.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Cyprus, said religious figures in the
northwestern Iranian city of Urumiyeh declared in a statement:
   ``We have already put on our death shrouds and pledge to carry
out the Imam's (Khomeini's) death sentence against Salman Rushdie
and his publishers in the United States and Europe.''
   Iran's lone diplomat in Britain, Mohammed Basti, was summoned to
the Foreign Office in London to discuss the situation and emerged
defiant, telling reporters Khomeini's ``decree or verdict'' had been
delivered ``after careful consideration.''
   ``It has nothing to do particularly with your country,'' the
charge d'affaires said.
   The Foreign Office called Khomeini's statement ``totally
unacceptable.''
   ``We recognize that Moslems and others may have strong views
about the contents of Mr. Rushdie's book,'' it said in a statement.
``However, no one has the right to incite people to violence on
British soil or against British citizens.''
   Rushdie, 41, was born into a Moslem family in India but is a
British citizen. Since ``The Satanic Verses'' was published in
Britain in September, it has sold more than 100,000 copies here and
received critical acclaim.
   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said today protests were being filed
in Washington and London seeking a ban on the novel.
   Pakistani fundamentalist leaders called for nationwide protests
Friday to condemn the book and denounce the deaths and injuries in
Sunday's protests by Moslem fundamentalists demanding ``The Satanic
Verses'' be pulled from U.S. shelves.
   The book has been banned in countries with large Moslem
populations, including India and South Africa, as well as most
Islamic nations, including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Egypt.
   No official ban has been announced in Iran, where the population
is overwhelmingly Shiite Moslem, but most foreign publications have
been banned in that country for years.
   In New York, a statement issued on behalf of author and publisher
said ``the current climate is not appropriate for a promotional tour
in the United States.'' The statement said: ``We reiterate that no
offense was intended in the creation or publication of this work.''
   The French publishing house Christian Bourgois said it was
delaying publication of the novel to avoid risk to the company, its
clients and readers.
   One of Italy's leading publishing companies, Arnoldo Mondadori
Editore SpA, announced today it will go ahead with next week's
planned release of ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday
that a senior Moslem clergyman in Iran, Hojatoleslam Hassan Saneie,
had offered $2.6 million to any Iranian who kills Rushdie and $1
million to a foreigner who kills the author.
   Tehran Radio said today that Mohammad Hashemian, the religious
leader in the southeastern city of Kerman, pledged another $2.6
million reward.
   A major character in the novel is named Mahound, a medieval
corruption of the name of the prophet Mohammed. Moslems have
complained the book represents the prophet's wives as prostitutes
and suggests that he wrote the Koran, rather than receiving it from
God.
   The title refers to verses Mohammed removed from the Koran,
Islam's holy book, believing they had been inspired by the devil.

appeal sent case to circuit court.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen black leaders convicted of
trespassing in their bid to remove the Confederate battle flag from
atop the state Capitol dome have asked a judge to dismiss the
charges.
   The defendants, Alabama NAACP President Thomas Reed and 13 black
legislators, pleaded innocent Wednesday in circuit court as they
sought a jury trial on the trespass charges.
   Last month a district judge convicted and fined the 14 defendants
$100 each in the misdemeanor case at the close of a lengthy,
non-jury proceeding. But the 14 defendants filed an appeal which
sent their case to circuit court.
   Circuit Judge Randall Thomas, who is to review various pre-trial
motions, did not immediately set a date for a jury trial.
   Reed, as part of a campaign by the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, called for the Confederate flag to be
removed from the Capitol last year. On Feb. 2, 1988, Reed led the
delegation of 14 to a fence surrounding the Capitol, which was
closed for restoration. He was arrested for trespassing when he
grabbed the fence as if he might climb it. The others were arrested
in sequence as they put a hand on the chain-link fence.
   Gov. Guy Hunt, the state's first Republican governor this
century, has said repeatedly he feels the Confederate flag is a
historic symbol and he will not remove it unless instructed to do so
by the Legislature. A measure to remove the flag died in the state
House last year.

   A customer at a fast-food restaurant got more
than two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles,
onions on a sesame seed bun from a drive-in window.
   The customer got part of the McDonald's receipts for the day when
an employee inadvertently gave the driver a take-out bag containing
cash instead of food.
   The mistake happened about 8 p.m. Friday when the night manager
placed money from the cash registers in a money bag, then placed
that bag inside a McDonald's bag while she awaited a police escort
to the bank, police Capt. Patrick Newkirk said.
   Managers often conceal money bags in restaurant bags to ward off
robbery attempts, Newkirk said.
   An unsuspecting employee handling a busy window handed the cash
to a customer. Newkirk said the manager said it was a ``sizable
amount of money'' but could not give an exact amount.
   No one has returned the money as of this morning, said police
Sgt. Ken Kaselonis. The restaurant's manager filed an initial police
report, but the company is not seeking a criminal investigation.

   The leaders of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and North
Yemen signed an accord today to create an economic alliance designed
to boost Arab unity, an official report said.
   Officials of the four countries say the new alliance is aimed
solely at cementing economic ties _ not at rivaling the Arab League
as a political bloc.
   The Iraqi News Agency said the pact was signed at a summit
meeting hosted by President Saddam Hussein. The meeting was attended
by King Hussein of Jordan; President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt; and
President Ali Abdullah Saleh of North Yemen.
   Recent press reports have speculated the new group, called the
Arab Cooperation Council, is meant to counter the influence of Saudi
Arabia.
   But Saudi King Fahd called the Iraqi president by telephone to
congratulate him and the three other leaders on forming the group,
the agency said.
   The main goal of the Arab Cooperation Council is to achieve
``cooperation, coordination, integration and solidarity'' among the
signatories, the agency said. The group's charter envisages
cooperation in agriculture, industry, culture and social programs.
The charter also calls for working toward an Arab common market, the
report said.
   The new group will have a general secretariat in Amman, Jordan.

<HEAD>Floodwaters Continue To Rise In Kentucky; Ease Elsewhere</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Floodwaters that drove hundreds of people
from their homes, closed roads and toppled a railroad bridge rose
today to their highest levels in 10 years or more though rainfall
eased off after four straight days.
   At 9 a.m., the Kentucky River at Frankfort was at 43.3 feet, 12.3
feet above flood level, and rising at 0.2 feet per hour. The
National Weather Service at Louisville predicted a crest of 44 feet
for later today, which would still be 4.7 feet below the level of
water that devastated the capital in December 1978.
   National Guard troops were called out with trucks and equipment
after Gov. Wallace Wilkinson declared a state of emergency on
Wednesday.
   ``We're trying to keep our spirits higher than the water,'' said
Verna Mouser, a city commissioner in the town of Boston who was
helping remove records and equipment from City Hall. The Salt River
at Boston, about 30 miles south of Louisville, was expected to crest
at a record 53 feet, and all roads leading into the town of 400 were
flooded.
   Though rainfall tapered off today in most parts of the state,
flooding would remain a ``major problem,'' particularly for people
living in low-lying areas and for motorists, the weather service
said.
   In neighboring Tennessee, the weather service canceled a flash
flood watch after only light rainfall was reported overnight; and in
West Virginia, minor flooding was reported and several rivers were
expected to crest at or near flood stage.
   But the flooding was most severe in Kentucky, where rainfall in
the central and western parts of the state since Sunday has totaled
up to 9 inches, sending the Kentucky, Licking, Salt, Green, Barren
and Rough rivers crashing out of their banks.
   At least 650 people were evacuated, including about 140 in
Lebanon Junction in Bullitt County and 100 in Frankfort, said the
state Division of Disaster and Emergency Services.
   ``I feel sorry for everyone we take out,'' said Herb Stewart,
emergency services coordinator for Ohio County. ``You feel good
about helping them out, but you think about what they're leaving
behind.''
   More than 80 members of the Kentucky National Guard were being
used for security in the state capital and to help with evacuations
elsewhere, officials said.
   The Kentucky River, which splits the state capital, made no
distinction between rich and poor, lapping around stately old homes
in an affluent section at the edge of downtown and the depressed
Bellepoint neighborhood on the opposite bank. Crews worked to place
sandbags around buildings.
   Capitol Avenue, the landscaped approach to the Capitol building
and governor's mansion, was blocked by water for about three blocks.
But the landmark buildings were on higher ground and were not in
danger.
   At a Jim Beam distillery in Boston, workers were brought in today
by boat, said Judy Bowman, spokesman at the company's Clermont
headquarters. ``That's the only way to get in and out,'' she said.
The plant, which has a flood-control system to keep water out of the
plant, continued to operate at full capacity, she said.
   Elsewhere, a CSX railroad trestle across the Rolling Fork of the
Salt River was swept away at New Haven, and scores of roads and tens
of schools in the state were closed because of high water.
   No fatalities were reported Wednesday, but three people drowned
on Tuesday and a fourth was missing and presumed drowned.

   An advanced navigation satellite was
shifted into a circular orbit about 11,000 miles above the Earth
today by the perfect firing of an onboard motor, the Air Force
reported.
   The Navstar Global Positioning System satellite was launched here
Tuesday into a preliminary elliptical orbit ranging from about 100
to 11,000 miles high. After tracking the payload for two days, a
ground station sent a signal to trigger the motor.
   ``It was a good 59-second burn; everything was nominal and
everything looks good,'' said Rick Huling, a spokeman for the Air
Force Systems Division in Los Angeles.
   Officials said ground controllers would check out the satellite's
systems for between 30 and 45 days before placing it on operational
patrol, joining seven earlier model Navstar satellites already in
orbit.
   The new Navstar GPS satellite, the first of a planned
constellation of 21 payloads, is designed to tell U.S. and allied
military forces exactly where they are within 50 feet anywhere on
the globe _ land, sea or air.
   The satellite was launched by the Air Force's new Delta 2 space
rocket.

<HEAD>Rebel Leader Claims Insurgents Control One-Fourth Of Colombia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Catholic priest who is the
leader of Colombia's most active leftist guerrilla group claimed in
a letter published today that insurgent groups control one-fourth of
the Latin American country.
   The letter from Manuel Perez, commander of the National
Liberation Army, to former president Alfonso Lopez Michelsen was
published by a half dozen Colombian dailies.
   Lopez has tried to get Colombian guerrillas and the government to
negotiate a truce with Colombia's six leftist guerrilla groups.
   No one answered the telephone at the Defense Ministry's public
affairs office today when The Associated Press tried to ask the
ministry about the guerrilla claim.
   In the last four years, AP reporters have found towns where
police stations have been abandoned because of guerrilla activity.
   The letter was received Wednesday by Lopez, the same day that
Perez's guerrillas reportedly ambushed two river boats in northern
Colombia.
   Five government soldiers, five sailors and 20 guerrillas were
killed, the commander of the army's 2nd Brigade, Gen. Juan Salcedo
Lora, said in a broadcast interview with the Colombian radio chain
RCN. The reported ambush occurred on the Cauca River, 240 miles
north of the capital of Bogota.
   About 150 guerrillas with automatic weapons caught the two boats
in a crossfire near the village of Guaranda, the general said. The
boats were carrying fuel and other supplies for army garrisons,
Salcedo said.
   Army troops aboard the boats fended off the attack until air
force planes attacked the rebels, Col. Jairo Garcia Camargo, said in
an RCN interview today.
   On Sunday, the National Liberation Army attacked a boat carrying
only civilians on the Magdalena River in central Colombia, the
Defense Ministry said earlier this week. Six passengers were killed
and 15 were wounded, it said.

   One of two sea lions snared by wildlife agents in
an attempt to protect a wild fish run died overnight before wildlife
agents could return it to the ocean, an official said today.
   ``We lost one of the animals,'' said Hal Alabaster, a spokesman
for the National Marine Fisheries Service. He did not have immediate
details on why the sea lion died.
   Wildlife agents agents trapped the sea lions in a floating cage
Wednesday and had planned to release the mammals today on the
southewest Washington coast. They were to have been transported by
truck.
   For five years, sea lions have been hanging out at the Ballard
Locks a few miles north of downtown Seattle, wolfing down the
steelhead and salmon that use a fish ladder to get from Puget Sound
to Lake Washington and the spawning streams beyond.
   The sea lion's death will not halt the effort to remove the
marine mammals, Alabaster said, adding that trapping would continue
today.
   So far, protective nets, tape recordings of killer whales,
firecrackers and foul-tasting chemicals have failed to stop the
steelhead and salmon suppers enjoyed by the voracious California sea
lions.
   Some local fishing advocates have suggested the 20 or so beasts
be shot, but they are protected by federal law.
   According to federal agents, one of the two sea lions captured
Wednesday, known as Blue Eye because of a cataract, has been a
problem at the locks for three years. It was not immediately clear
which sea lion had died.
   The plan was to tranquilize the sea lions, attach radio
transmitters to them and transport them by truck on a trip of five
hours or more to the coast for release today off the Long Beach
Peninsula, 250 miles southwest of Seattle.
   Bob DeLong, a marine mammal biologist with the National Marine
Fisheries Service, admitted that scientists have no idea whether
``Operation Goodbye'' will work. He conceded that Blue Eye certainly
knows the way back.
   ``He's come back at least three years in a row from California
and Mexico and if he wants to come back, he'll return,'' DeLong
said, adding that he could probably make the trip in two days if he
hurried.
   Wildlife officials said they eventually hope to capture at least
a half dozen animals and haul them to the peninsula, then see if
they return.
   If they don't, the rest of the problem animals that can be caught
will be moved, DeLong said.
   Wednesday's operation was observed by Ben Deeble of Greenpeace,
which has protested some of the anti-sea lion actions in the past
but gave qualified support to the removal effort.
   Deeble said a primary concern was the drugging of the sea lions,
which he said could kill the animals.
   Deeble said long-term solutions to the problem of the hungry sea
lions would include modifying the approach the fish have to make to
the fish ladder, and increasing the number of fish in the watershed.
However, that could be difficult at the rate the steelhead are being
killed by the sea lions.
   Steelhead are rainbow trout which return to their native rivers
and streams in western Washington after a few years in the Pacific
Ocean.
   The male sea lions, which summer in California and Mexico waters
and winter off the coasts of Oregon, Washington and British
Columbia, have increased dramatically in numbers since the passage
of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in the mid-1970s.

   A businessman was sentenced to 27 years in
federal prison today for masterminding the smuggling of a record
7,300 pounds of Colombian cocaine into the United States in
hollowed-out lumber last spring.
   U.S. District Judge George C. Carr rejected tearful pleas by
Michael Tsalickis, 61, to impose a lighter sentence. The judge said
he thought evidence in the trial had been clear.
   Tsalickis, jailed since his arrest last May, faced from 10 years
to life for his conviction in October on two counts of smuggling and
two counts of drug trafficking. During a monthlong trial, the
government claimed he was working with a ruthless Colombian drug
organization known as the Cali Cartel.
   Prosecutors had urged the maximum sentence, telling Carr that
their calculations showed the cocaine haul translated into 57
million doses. But the judge's sentence was within federal
sentencing guidelines, which called for a prison term of 24 to 30
years.
   ``This is the largest seizure in the history of the U.S. in which
there has been an arrest,'' assistant U.S. attorney Walter Furr told
Carr. ``Your sentence must punish, deter others and promote respect
for the law.''
   Tsalickis, who lived in Colombia for 35 years and ran an
import-export business, read from a statement, breaking down and
crying as he did so.
   ``If I did harm society in the eyes of the court, then I am truly
sorry,'' he said. His attorney, Frank Wilkles, said an appeal would
be filed.
   During Tsalickis' trial in Tampa federal court, U.S. prosecutors
told jurors that Tsalickis orchestrated the smuggling operation in
which cocaine was hidden inside bundles of cedar lumber shipped from
Brazil.
   Tsalickis and two Colombian associates, Freddy Perez-Rivera, 28,
and Pedro Narvaez, 35, were arrested May 3. The two Colombians were
convicted of conspiracy to smuggle the cocaine in a separate trial.
   Federal and local drug agents, acting on a tip, had watched the
trio as they organized the unloading of the lumber in St.
Petersburg, separated the lumber containing the cocaine from the
rest of the wood, and had it transported by truck to a Tarpon
Springs warehouse owned by Tsalickis.

<HEAD>Security Council Authorizes Namibia Independence Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Security Council today authorized an
independence plan and U.N. peacekeeping force for Namibia, setting
in motion the end of 74 years of South African rule over the
continent's last colony.
   The 15 council members unanimously adopted a resolution
implementing an independence plan for Namibia.
   April 1 was set as the date to begin the one-year plan for
Namibia's transition to an independent, black majority-ruled nation.
   Today's resolution also approved a report by Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar on implementing the plan, which calls for
sending 4,650 U.N. peacekeepers, 500 police and 1,000 civilian
election monitors to Namibia.
   The U.N.'s Namibian independence mission will be called the U.N.
Transition Assistance Group. Perez de Cuellar has estimated the
project will cost $416 million in its first year.
   The General Assembly is expected to authorize funds for a 70-man
team of U.N. military observers who will monitor the withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban troops from Angola as neighboring Namibia becomes
independent.
   The stage was set for the Cuban pullout and the Namibian
independence process in December, when South Africa, Cuba and Angola
signed accords at U.N. Headquarters pledging their cooperation with
a southwest African pace plan.
   Cuba has stationed troops in Angola at that country's request
since 1975, to defend Angola's Marxist government from attacks by
South African troops and the U.S.-backed rebels of UNITA, the
National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola. South Africa has
ruled Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, since it captured
the territory from Germany during World War I.
   The U.N.'s predecessor, the League of Nations, gave South Africa
a mandate to govern Namibia in 1920, but since World War II the
World Court, General Assembly and Security Council all have ruled
that Pretoria's mandate is void.
   South Africa refused to relinquish control of Namibia without the
withdrawal of the Cuban troops, saying their presence just over
Namibia's northern border could intimidate voters during the
independence.
   Under the southwest Africa peace accords, half of the 50,000
Cuban soldiers will have withdrawn by Nov. 1, when Namibia is
scheduled to begin a week of elections for a constituent assembly.
That constituent assembly will draft a constitution and organize a
black majority-ruled government in Namibia, with independence
envisaged in April 1990.
   All Cuban troops are to be out of Angola by July 1991.
   Beginning April 1, the South African military is to reduce its
forces in Namibia to 1,500 troops confined to barracks under U.N.
supervision, and cut back the size of Namibia's police force.
   U.N. peacekeepers will also monitor camps in which the guerrillas
of the South-West Africa People's Organization, SWAPO, will stay.
   SWAPO, a Marxist-influenced independence movement led by Sam
Nujoma, is expected to win a majority of the seats in Namibia's
constituent assembly, but if it fails to hold two-thirds of the
seats it will have to form a coalition with some of the other
parties in Namibia.
   A coalition would probably result in a multiparty state,
observers say, but if SWAPO wins two-thirds of the seats in the
contituent assembly it will probably declare a one-party state.

   Syafrudin Prawiranegara, who served as
Indonesia's prime minister in 1948-49 and later rebelled against
Sukarno, the nation's first president, has died at the age of 76.
   Syafrudin died of heart failure Wednesday.
   He was minister of economics when he took over as prime minister
in 1948 after the former Dutch colonial rulers captured Sukarno at
Jogjakarta, Central Java.
   Indonesian nationalists had proclaimed independence for the
country in 1945, but the Netherlands did not recognize the new
republic until Dec. 27, 1949. Sukarno, one of the leaders of the
nationalist struggle, was president from 1949 until 1967. He died in
1970.
   Syafrudin became an Islamic preacher after leaving government.
   Syafrudin, who was buried Thursday, is survived by his wife and
eight children.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's state funeral may be the biggest
in modern times, a Foreign Ministry official said Thursday.
   Japan expects representatives of 154 countries to attend the Feb.
24 rites, led by President Bush and including 54 other heads of
state and many more royals, vice presidents, prime ministers and
foreign ministers, according to a senior official, who spoke on
condition he not be identified.
   The funeral is budgeted at $74 million, including $25.4 million
to be spent on the funeral site, where there will be a sanctuary and
two huge tents to shelter 10,000 dignitaries, $19 million for
security and $21 million to build a mausoleum.
   The Japanese press called it the most expensive state funeral in
history.
   Soon after Hirohito died of cancer at the age of 87 on Jan. 7,
the government notified all 165 countries with which Japan has
relations that they were welcome to send delegations to the funeral.
   Bush quickly accepted, but some countries debated vigorously
whether to send high-level representatives because of Hirohito's
role as leader in World War II.
   The Netherlands, for instance, is sending its foreign minister
but not a member of the royal family because of bitter memories of
Japan's harsh treatment of the Dutch East Indies.
   The overall high level of the delegates is gratifying to Japan,
the Foreign Ministry official said. ``The number of guests and their
high rank is beyond our expectations,'' he said.
   The number of official foreign mourners is expected to be at
least 600, he said, acknowledging difficult problems with protocol
and logistics.
   Some ambassadors complained they will have to group up and arrive
at the funeral in buses. He said Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's
Cabinet still was wrestling with the protocol issue of how to seat
the guests.
   By tradition, those with longer tenure should have more prominent
seats. That would leave Bush, in office less than a month, in the
back of the crowd.
   ``We are studying all the precedents of past funerals, and I hope
our government will come to a fast conclusion,'' he said.
   Asked how Bush would be treated, he laughed nervously and said:
``The matter is not so simple.'' He did not comment further.
   The 154 countries to be represented include 145 that are actually
sending delegates from abroad, he said. Nine are to be represented
by ambassadors accredited to Tokyo.
   Other recent state funerals:
   _ The 1963 funeral of President John F. Kennedy drew
representatives from more than 100 countries.
   _ The 1980 funeral for Yugoslav President Josip Tito drew 127
foreign delegations.
   _ The 1981 funeral of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat drew
representatives from more than 80 countries; the United States sent
former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald R. Ford and Richard M. Nixon.
   _ The 1984 funeral of Soviet leader Yuri Andropov drew more than
100 foreign delegations.

<HEAD>Intellectuals Call For Amnesty Of Political Prisoners</HEAD>

   Dozens of China's most famous writers and thinkers
called for an amnesty for political prisoners in an open letter sent
Thursday to the government and ruling Communist Party.
   ``An amnesty ... would be beneficial to the atmosphere of reform
and in accordance with the increasing respect for human rights which
is a pervasive trend in the world today,'' said the letter, copies
of which were given to journalists by several of the signers.
   It was addressed to the standing committee of the National
People's Congress, China's legislature, and the party Central
Committee.
   The 33 signers ranged from Bing Xin, 87, one of China's most
famous pre-Communist woman writers, to 26-year-old author Lao Mu,
who helped draft and distribute the letter.
   ``I think it is the first time since (1949) that intellectuals of
all generations, writers from the 1930s and current writers, all
have joined in such an action,'' said Bei Dao, a 40-year-old poet
and short story writer who got the idea to draft the letter.
   ``I think intellectuals are waking up,'' he said. ``I don't have
any special interest in politics. Like most writers, I'm interested
in my work. But I have a conscience.''
   There are no reliable figures for the number of political
prisoners in China. The London-based human rights group Amnesty
International estimates there are thousands of prisoners of
conscience, including political dissidents, clergy and members of
minority groups such as Tibetans opposed to Chinese rule.
   China acknowledges jailing ``counterrevolutionaries'' but has
never given a number.
   China's most famous dissident, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, made a
similar call for an amnesty in a letter to Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping last month. The new letter expressed ``deep concern'' for
Fang's proposal.
   Like Fang, the petitioners singled out Wei Jingsheng, one of the
leaders of a brief political thaw called the Democracy Wall
Movement. Wei was arrested in 1979 and sentenced to 15 years in
prison after calling for democracy as a ``fifth modernization'' to
go along with Deng's program of updating industry, agriculture,
science and national defense.
   ``We hear Wei has gone mad in prison,'' said Bei. ``We have no
proof, there's no way to contact him.''
   Several dozen other Democracy Wall activists also were arrested
and many remain jailed.
   ``Of course we hope the government will respond and give amnesty
to Wei and the others,'' Bei said. ``But realistically _ I don't
know. For such a large group of prominent intellectuals to express
their view, I think it must have influence ... eventually.''
   Su Shaozhi, a leading Marxist theorist who was dismissed in 1987
as director of China's Marxism-Leninism Institute because of his
liberalism, said the government probably ``won't pay attention.''
   But Su said he didn't think anyone would be punished because of
the letter. ``The signers are very famous. They will have to think
how to treat us,'' he said.
   The letter comes during a period of unusual outspokenness by
Chinese intellectuals, who know well the government's pattern of
allowing brief periods of free discussion and then cracking down.
   Small groups of liberal intellectuals have begun meeting to
discuss such dangerous topics as democracy and multiparty rule.
   Ren Wanding, another Democracy Wall activist who was jailed from
1979-83, has declared 1989 a memorial year for his jailed colleagues
and issued a series of essays calling attention to human rights
abuses.
   The letter suggested the political amnesty be given to mark two
other anniversaries this year: the 40th anniversary of China's
communist revolution and the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth
Movement of 1919, which began as a student protest against foreign
occupation of parts of China and turned into a movement for
liberalism and democratic reform.
   Chen Jun, a former student who signed the letter, and Bei both
stressed that the letter signers have many different political views.
   ``But this is just one point on which we all agree,'' Chen said
of the amnesty. He said he hoped to continue collecting signatures,
even though the original letter has been mailed.
   Other signers included Li Zehou, a philosopher who was a delegate
to the 7th National People's Congress that met last year; Wang
Ruoshui, former deputy editor of the party newspaper, the People's
Daily; playwright Wu Zuguang; and novelist Zhang Jie, whose works
have been widely translated.

<HEAD>Famed German Stage Pioneer Dead at Age 88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ida Ehre, one of the country's
best-known actresses and a postwar pioneer of the German stage, died
Thursday at the age of 88.
   She died of a heart attack in a Hamburg hospital, said officials
with the Hamburg Kammerspiele, the famed theater founded and
directed by Ms. Ehre.
   Ms. Ehre is credited with being a major force in reviving the
German stage after years of cultural repression under the Nazi
regime of Adolf Hitler.
   She started the Kammerspiele seven months after Nazi Germany's
defeat in 1945.
   Ms. Ehre, born to Austrian parents, was a victim of Nazi
repression because of her Jewish faith. She was banned from the
stage in 1933 after moving to Berlin.
   One of the earliest works she staged at the Kammerspiele was
``The Man Outside,'' a play written by Wolfgang Borchert about the
torments of a German soldier after his return home from the war. The
premiere of the play at Ms. Ehre's theater lifted the work to fame.
   She also staged works by Thorton Wilder, Jean-Paul Sartre and
other non-German authors, giving the Kammerspiele an international
reputation.
   Ms. Ehre studied at the Academy for Music and Theater in Vienna.
She gave her first professional performance in 1918 and performed in
dozens of European cities.
   She continued to act after founding the Kammerspiele, and one of
her best-remembered performances was playing the title role in
Bertolt Brecht's ``Mother Courage.''

<HEAD>Housing Starts Surge 8 Percent in January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction posted its biggest gain in
nearly a year during January, the government reported Thursday, but
analysts said the surge was due more to unusually mild weather than
an upturn in the market.
   Construction of new homes and apartments was up 8 percent in
January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.69 million units
after inching up just 0.1 percent during December, the Commerce
Department reported.
   It was the biggest monthly increase since an 8.6 percent rise in
February 1988 and placed housing activity at its highest level since
the March 1987 annual rate of 1.72 million units.
   At the White House, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
called the figures ``good news for the housing industry and a good
sign that people are confident in the economy.''
   Analysts said the increase was mainly the result of unseasonably
warm, dry weather throughout much of the country, which allowed more
housing starts than in a typical January. Small increases can be
amplified as the figures are annualized and seasonally adjusted.
   ``We don't believe this is representative of the underlying trend
in the market,'' David Seiders, chief economist for the National
Association of Home Builders, said of January's surge. ``We don't
expect it to hold this way. We're betting on a slowdown as we go
through the year.''
   Housing construction dropped 8.2 percent in 1988 to its lowest
level in six years, and is expected to decline again this year as
mortgage rates continue to rise and the general economic expansion
slows.
   Nevertheless, analysts say the housing market still is relatively
healthy and that January's numbers may suggest some new strength.
   ``It's really pretty surprising to see this much strength in the
housing market when interest rates have been rising and when the
affordability of housing is getting harder for people to meet,''
said economist Martin Regalia of the National Council of Savings
Institutions.
   ``Underneath it all, we're seeing a surprisingly strong housing
market given the financial conditions,'' he said.
   Single-family homes were built in January at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.2 million units, the highest since
September 1987, when the rate was 1.23 million. January's figure was
up 7.1 percent from December.
   Seiders said part of the strength in the single-family market was
due to the use of adjustable-rate mortgages that allow families to
start out making lower monthly payments than otherwise possible.
   Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.56 percent
last week, up from 9.84 percent a year earlier, according to a
survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. On one-year
adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial
rate of 8.61 percent, up from 7.61 percent a year earlier.
   Apartment construction, a volatile category, was up 10.1 percent
last month to 490,000 units, after a 3.7 percent gain in December.
   The apartment sector has been weakened by high vacancy rates and
changes under the 1986 tax law that reduced incentives for investing
in rental projects.
   Overall, January's gains in new construction were concentrated in
the Northeast, where housing starts shot up 51.8 percent to an
annual rate of 296,000 units.
   Analysts again said mild weather was behind the upturn in a
region where the housing market has been weak in recent months after
an earlier boom during which prices soared.
   ``The Northeast overall is still a market that is not as strong
as it was a couple years ago,'' Regalia said. ``It's going through a
normal cycle and it's going to be ebbing somewhat in the coming
months, but I don't see that as crashing.''
   Construction rose 4.4 percent in the West in January, to a rate
of 449,000 units, and 3 percent in the South to 616,000 units.
Housing starts were down 3.8 percent in the Midwest, to a rate of
332,000 units.
   Housing permits, a good barometer of future housing activity,
were down 2.7 percent last month to a rate of 1.52 million units
after rising 3.3 percent in December.
   Housing construction reached its post-recession peak in 1986,
when 1.81 million units were built, then began sliding. Last year,
the level was 1.49 million units.

<HEAD>Arms Control Chief Says Tower Lacked Discretion in Geneva</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary-designate John Tower's
personal indiscretions proved troublesome for the State Department
during arms talks in Geneva, the nation's arms control chief said.
   Kenneth L. Adelman said Wednesday in a Washington Times column
and in a Los Angeles Times interview published today that Tower's
actions, which he declined to specify, raised questions about his
judgment and integrity.
   The FBI file on Tower contains allegations that Tower slept with
women on the arms control delegation staff and that his behavior was
disruptive to delegation business, said the Los Angeles Times,
citing unidentified informed sources.
   Adelman, director of the State Department's Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency from 1983 to 1987, is the highest ranking former
or current U.S. official to raise doubts about Tower's fitness.
   From January 1985 to April 1986, Tower headed the department's
delegation that discussed mutual cuts in long-range nuclear missiles
with the Soviets.
   Tower's private behavior didn't directly affect his conduct of
official business at the Geneva talks, but Adelman said it should be
a factor in the Senate confirmation deliberations because ``a
defense secretary has no private life.''
   ``In the military chain of command just below the president, he
must be of sound and clear mind by day and by night,'' he said.
   Adelman said in his column in the Washington Times that he was
impressed with Tower's performance as a strategic arms negotiator,
``Yet his lack of discretion proved troublesome then, as before and
since.''

<BYLINE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with British official suggesting limits

<TEXT>
   Britain's transportation secretary today urged
aviation officials to consider banning electronic devices from
airplane luggage or at least requiring such items be carried onto
jets rather than checked as luggage.
   Paul Channon made his comments after investigators in Lockerbie,
Scotland, said the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 was hidden in
a radio-cassette player and loaded on with luggage, probably in
Frankfurt.
   ``This is further evidence of the extent of this serious
problem,'' Channon told the 33-member council of the International
Civil Aviation Administration.
   Channon said items such as radios and computers ``cannot be
easily opened. They provide enough space to conceal explosives, and
the electrical components of explosive devices may not be
distinguished under X-ray from those of the equipment itself. We
need to ask ourselves whether these devices should be allowed to be
carried on aircraft.''
   Channon said one option would be to ban electronic devices from
checked baggage.
   ``Should we at least no longer allow them in checked baggage, and
require them to be presented at the check-in, perhaps for conveyance
in the least vulnerable part of the aircraft?'' he suggested.
   The council has been considering whether steps should be taken to
limit the carrying of radios, computers and other electronical
equipment. It also is considering whether to direct its staff to
study ways in which aircraft design could take security
considerations into account.
   ``I think that some fairly simple and inexpensive modifications
could make it harder for terrorists to hide a bomb on board and
easier for security staff to search cabins, toilets and galleys,''
Channon said, citing better locking systems on aircraft doors as an
example.
   U.S. and British transportation officials have called for swift
efforts to combat terrorism in the skies through tougher screening
of passengers and luggage and better bomb-detection devices.
   ``People around the world are calling for leadership and decisive
action to eliminate the gruesome, common threat of terrorism in the
skies,'' U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner told the
aviation meeting on its opening day Wednesday.
   Britain and the United States had asked that the council convene
the two-day meeting because of the Dec. 21 bombing of Flight 103,
which killed all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground in
Scotland.
   Chief Superintendent John Orr, who is heading the investigation
into the bombing, today refused to describe the size of the recorder
and said it was not certain the bomb was put aboard in Frankfurt,
where the flight originated.
   But answering reporters' questions, he said ``the balance of
probabilities'' pointed to Frankfurt rather than London, where the
New York-bound flight changed jets and took on new passengers.
   Although the 160-member U.N. agency meeting in Canada has no
power to enforce its resolutions, the presence of more than a dozen
transport ministers has underscored their concern about the problem.
   Skinner reminded the council that 867 people have died in 21
explosions aboard civilian airliners in the last decade.
   Members have discussed a two-tier system in which more stringent
security systems could be placed in areas of highest risk.
   The U.S. aviation system has instituted more stringent security
measures in recent weeks, but American officials say concerted
international action is needed.

   A teen-ager was arrested today in the
slaying of Gov. Joe Frank Harris' 74-year-old aunt, police said.
   William C. Scott, 18, of Cassville was arrested about 8:45 a.m.
today as he drove along U.S. 41 in Cartersville, Georgia Bureau of
Investigation Director Robbie Hamrick said. Scott was charged with
murder, aggravated sodomy and burglary.
   Allie Morrow Roper, a retired florist, was found dead at her
Cartersville home Sunday after friends missed her at church.
Authorities said she was strangled late Saturday, probably by an
intruder.
   Harris served as a pallbearer at his aunt's funeral Tuesday.
   Hamrick said police identified Scott as a suspect Wednesday
through fingerprint evidence processed by the bureau's new automatic
fingerprint identification system, which greatly speeds up the
process of matching fingerprints found at a crime scene with
fingerprints on file.
   ``It's a new system not fully operational yet,'' Hamrick said at
a news conference. ``This is one of the first hits we've made on
this system.''
   Police said they did not know whether Scott knew Mrs. Roper, and
they did not have information about his background. No bond was set
immediately, and no court date was scheduled.
   Police sought Scott for about 16 hours before his arrest, Hamrick
said, adding that he did not resist arrest when stopped.

<TEXT>
   Text of a statement Thursday
from black anti-apartheid leaders on Winnie Mandela, wife of African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Today's press conference is called after the culminating of
community meetings in Soweto and throughout the country. The present
controversy surrounding Mrs. Mandela's ``football club'' has been
the subject of intense discussion within the ranks of the mass
democratic movement. Numerous attempts have been made to resolve
this matter, but without much success.
   We have now reached the state where we have no option but to
speak publicly on what is a very sensitive and painful matter.
   The Mandela family has always occupied a very special position in
the hearts of our people. Mrs. Mandela has been painfully separated
from her husband for most of her married life _ first, while Nelson
Mandela worked in the underground of the ANC and thereafter, his
imprisonment following the Rivonia trial.
   During this period, she has had to rear her children
single-handedly in the face of lengthy house arrests, detentions and
her cruel banishment to Brandfort. We pay tribute to her
contribution.
   In recent years, Mrs. Mandela's actions have increasingly led her
into conflict with various sections of the oppressed people and with
the mass democratic movement as a whole. The recent conflict in the
community has centered largely around the conduct of her so-called
football club, which has been widely condemned by the community. In
particular, we are outraged by the reign of terror that the team has
been associated with. Not only is Mrs. Mandela associated with the
team, in fact, the team is her own creation.
   We are of the view that Mrs. Mandela has abused the trust and
confidence which she has enjoyed over the years. She has not been a
member of any of the democratic structures of the UDF (United
Democratic Front) and COSATU (Congress of South African Trade
Unions), and she has often acted without consulting the democratic
movement. Often, her practices have violated the spirit and ethos of
the democratic movement.
   Numerous efforts have been made to reconcile the conflict between
Mrs. Mandela and the community. The last of these efforts was the
formation of a crisis committee comprising of some of our most able
and respected members. On every occasion Mrs. Mandela has refused to
cooperate and has chosen to disregard the sentiments of the
community.
   The democratic movement has uncompromisingly fought against
violations of human rights from whatever quarters. We are not
prepared to remain silent where those who are violating human rights
claim to be doing so in the name of the struggle against apartheid.
   We are outraged at Mrs. Mandela's complicity in the recent
abductions and assault of Stompie (Seipei). Had Stompie and his
three colleagues not been abducted by Mrs. Mandela's ``football
team,'' he would have been alive today.
   The mass democratic movement hereby distances itself from Mrs.
Mandela and her actions.
   We call on our people, in particular, the Soweto community, to
exercise this distancing in a dignified manner.
   We take the opportunity to reaffirm our unqualified support for
our leader, Nelson Mandela, and call for his immediate release.
   The actions associated with this football team, and even with
members of his family, should never be used to undermine the esteem
in which we still hold comrade Nelson.

   Hundreds of rescue workers with dogs
Thursday searched the wreckage of an apartment building destroyed by
an explosion of unknown origin that killed at least 13 people,
officials said.
   The blast Wednesday also left 21 people hospitalized, six of them
seriously hurt.
   More than 300 rescue workers worked by hand to search the debris
of the 18th century building, known as the ``house of heads''
because of the sculptured heads which ornamented the facade.
   They used amplifiers to capture any cries in the rubble and
worked throughout the night.
   The explosion also damaged nearby buildings in the center of this
Mediterranean port city, including a section of the city hall.
   Mayor Francois Trucy said the explosion appeared to have occurred
on the second floor of the six-story apartment house, which included
a grocery store on the ground floor and some offices.
   Authorities opened an investigation into the cause of the
explosion, initially attributed to gas.
   The gas company, Gaz de France, said it had received no notice of
a gas leak prior to the explosion. A dentist in the building, Dr.
Daniel Cohen, said he had smelled a burning odor ``like a big short
circuit'' just before the disaster.
   Officials said many victims, severely mangled under tons of stone
and metal, were being identified by the clothes they wore.
   ``We won't stop the search until all the debris has been
removed,'' said one rescuer.

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas attacked an
army-guarded cotton cooperative and two Civil Defense posts in the
central region today, killing at least nine soldiers, the military
said.
   The attack came while the rebels and political parties negotiated
where and when to discuss a rebel proposal to delay this year's
presidential elections.
   The rebels attacked the Entre Rios cooperative with mortar and
rifle fire before dawn, according to a preliminary report from the
armed forces in the capital. It said six soldiers were killed and
seven wounded in the attack 20 miles southeast of San Salvador.
   The report made no mention of guerrilla casualties. Broadcast
reports from radio correspondents said eight soldiers were killed.
   The rebels attacked the cooperative as part of their strategy of
economic sabotage in waging their nine-year war against the
U.S.-backed government.
   They also attacked Civil Defense posts in Jerusalen and Ostuma in
the province of La Paz early today, the military report said. It
reported three soldiers were killed and three wounded in those
attacks.
   The fighting flared despite an announcement Wednesday by 13
political parties who said they were willing to meet with a rebel
delegation next week in Mexico, Guatemala or Costa Rica. They
suggested the meeting take place Monday.
   Rebels proposed last month that the presidential election
scheduled for March 19 be postponed until September, giving the
opposition more time to prepare. In a dramatic change of policy, the
guerrillas said they would participate in the election and respect
the outcome if voting was put off and if their conditions regarding
security and fraud were met.
   However, the government and military have virtually ruled out any
postponement. The rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or
Arena, is favored to win the March election, and it too is against
postponement.

   Smith said that Miller's daughter and son-in-law, Jonnie Dee and

   Miller disappeared on a European flight during a World War II

<HEAD>Red Cross Suspends Relief Airlift to Southern Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross has
suspended temporarily an airlift of relief supplies to southern
Sudan while pursuing negotiations with anti-government rebels, a
spokesman said Thursday.
   Relief flights were stopped Tuesday after the Sudan People's
Liberation Army demanded changes in the Red Cross' notification
procedure for its flights to the cities of Wau, Aweil, Akon and
Yirol, said Red Cross spokesman Juerg Bischoff.
   To ensure safe passage, the Red Cross notifies both the Khartoum
government and the rebels of all relief flights. Bischoff said he
expects the airlift, begun Dec. 4, to resume ``in a matter of days.''
   He said the negotiations concern ``technical issues.''
   About 40 delegates of the all-Swiss humanitarian agency have
remained in the area to distribute food and medicine to the needy,
Bischoff said.
   Tens of thousands of people are known to need emergency aid in
southern Sudan. The rebels, who gained control of the region, have
allowed U.N. and Red Cross relief planes to land in the area's
cities, where peasant farmers have fled to escape the guerrilla war.
   Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese are believed to face the risk
of starvation unless food is delivered throughout the country,
before the rains start in May, to about 4 million people displaced
by rebellion, drought and famine.
   The government of Sudan, which has battled the rebels since 1983,
has invited U.N. relief officials to Khartoum on March 8-9 to plan a
massive anti-famine campaign.
   The United States and other Western nations are pressuring the
Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi to improve the distribution of food and
other aid to all sections of his country.
   His government has often cited the rebellion in the south as
posing too great a danger for relief flights and convoys. The
government has allowed little aid to reach the south, where an
estimated 500,000 people died of starvation last year.

   Moslem guerrillas fired a barrage of
rockets into the capital and another city today, one day after the
Soviets completed their troop withdrawal, and official reports said
at least 13 people were killed.
   Also today, the Afghan foreign minister said the government has
asked the United Nations to set up outposts along the border with
Pakistan to stem the flow of arms to Moslem guerrillas.
   In the attack on Kabul by U.S.-backed guerrillas, one rocket
landed outside a house in western Kabul, killing three children
playing in the street, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Another
young girl was killed and her mother's legs were blown off but she
survived, the spokesman said.
   Less than a half mile away, a rocket struck near a power
transmission station, killing a bus driver and two men, the official
said. Five people were injured in the rocket attack, said the
spokesman, who demanded anonymity.
   Rebel rockets also hit near a Sikh community and the airport,
which was closed today because of heavy snow.
   Mohammad Badakhshi, who lost his 11-year-old daughter in today's
attack, asked ``Who is doing this?'' Speaking to foreign reporters,
he added: ``I've lost my daughter, and now I'm losing my mind.''
   About 105 miles to the south in Ghazni city, rebel rockets killed
six people, Radio Kabul said in a report monitored in Islamabad,
Pakistan. Radio Kabul said 34 guerrillas were killed in fighting
during the previous 24 hours. The radio also charged that 600
Pakistani troops marched toward Ghazni on Friday to carry out
``terrorist activities.'' It said some were deployed in the garrison
town of Urgun about 15 miles from the Pakistani border.
   Pakistani officials had no immediate reaction, but they have
denied previous accusations by the Afghan government that they
planned to invade the eastern city of Jalalabad.
   The Soviet Union on Wednesday ended nine years of military
intervention in Afghanistan, leaving Afghan troops alone in their
fight against the guerrillas.
   In his comments today, Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil of
Afghanistan accused Britain, France and other Western nations
opposed to Afghanistan's Marxist government of blocking emergency
airlifts of food into Kabul, which is facing severe shortages. An
official with the United Nations, which is coordinating the airlift,
declined to comment on Wakil's statement.
   Some Western officials have predicted that the Afghan army will
be unable to prevent Kabul and other major Afghan cities from being
taken by Pakistani-based Moslem guerrilla forces now that the Soviet
forces are gone.
   The foreign minister said Afghanistan has asked the U.N. Good
Office Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan to set up outposts near
six towns along the border. The agency, UNGOMAP, monitors compliance
with the Geneva accord signed in April that paved the way for the
withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Red Army troops and called on
Afghanistan and Pakistan to stop interfering in each other's
internal affairs.
   Wakil said Afghanistan has asked that outposts be set up near the
towns of Quttarr, Landi Kotall, Torkahn, Chaman, Spin Boldak and
Parchinarr.
   ``We have requested that UNGOMAP establish outposts along the
border to prevent the open transport of arms, ammunition and other
deadly weapons into Afghanistan from Pakistan,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, Najib thanked Moscow for its military support and
accused the United States of trampling on the accord for the Soviet
withdrawal.
   The government said in a statement that Washington's support for
the guerrillas had sharply risen since the accord was signed in
April.

<HEAD>Gunmen Injure Five In Attack on Protestant Bar</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to ADD claim of responsibility. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen burst into a Protestant
clubhouse in Belfast today and opened fire with automatic weapons,
injuring five people, police said. An extremist splinter of the IRA
claimed responsibility.
   The incident occurred at midday at the Orange Cross Social Club,
a drinking spot in the predominantly Protestant Shankill district,
police said.
   A witness told London Broadcasting Corp. radio that three
attackers lined up some men against the bar and opened fire with
Kalashnikov assault rifles.
   ``They singled out a few men on the premises, put them against
the bar, and started to shoot indiscriminately,'' said the witness,
who was not identified.
   Nearby Mater Hospital said it admitted one man in very serious
condition with head injuries and two with serious chest wounds. Two
women were in stable condition with stomach injuries.
   The Irish National Liberation Army, a small offshoot of the
predominantly Catholic Irish Republican Army, claimed responsibility
in a statement to Belfast news media, saying it was avenging recent
attacks on Catholics.
   Protestant extremists claimed responsibility for the shooting
deaths of Tony Fusco, a Belfast businessman with no known political
links; and Patrick Finucane, who was prominent as an attorney for
IRA suspects.
   Also this week, gunmen killed John Joe Davey, a member of the
Magherafelt town council for Sinn Fein, the outlawed IRA's political
wing. No claim of responsibility was made.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the province with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
   The Irish National Liberation Army, formed by disaffected IRA
members in the 1970s, has been reduced in size by an internal feud
but is believed to retain a handful of armed activists.
   After the attack, a van was found burning outside Divis Flats, a
Catholic-populated tenement block, and police said they were
investigating whether it was hijacked by the gunmen.

   Rescue workers uncovered 11 more bodies
today from the rubble of a six-story building that exploded and
collapsed, bringing nty-one people remained hospitalized, including six
in serious
condition, the officials said.
   The violence of the explosion Wednesday damaged nearby buildings
in the center of this Mediterranean port, including a nearby section
of city hall.
   Mayor Francois Trucy said the explosion appeared to have occurred
on the second floor of the 18th century building that collapsed. It
contained both apartments and businesses.
   Authorities were investigating the cause of the explosion, which
was initially attributed to gas.
   Officials said many victims, severely mangled under tons of stone
and metal, were being identified by the clothes they wore.
   More than 300 rescue workers were involved in the search for
bodies which continued throughout the night with specially trained
dogs. Rescuers were sifting through the debris by hand to avoid any
risk of further collapse.
   ``It is a horror,'' one rescue worker said.

   A 1.2-million-gallon tank of molasses burst
at a sugar factory, spilling a cascade of sticky liquid that coated
three workers and flattened a small building ``as if someone had
stepped on a pop can.''
   One of the workers was swept 100 feet out of the building
Wednesday and waded through the syrupy flood to help his co-workers
from the rubble, Scotts Bluff County sheriff's deputies said. No one
was seriously hurt.
   ``At this point we're just going to try to contain it. There's
nothing hazardous about the material. It's just sticky,'' said John
Sagaser, manager of the Western Sugar Co. plant where the accident
occurred about 20 miles east of the Wyoming border.
   The factory's one-story, modular office-laboratory was demolished
when it was buried by a wave of molasses. Sheriff's Deputy Bob
DeLara said it looked ``as if someone had stepped on a pop can, just
squashed it down.''
   City crews built a dike to keep the molasses from entering a
storm sewer. The wave apparently crested at 10 feet, leaving marks
that high on walls and piles of dirt nearby.
   ``We saw this stuff all gushing out and saw the cars by the
road,'' said witness Julie Wooden of Scottsbluff. ``We saw people
digging themselves out. It looked like a flood.''
   The three workers caught in the goop, Russell Dilley, 69, Vernon
Dyer, 45, of Gering and Gloria Thompson, 45, were treated at
Regional West Medical Center in Scotts Bluff for cuts and scrapes.
   Sheriff's Deputy Jack Medearis said the workers told him they
heard a rumble and knew the building they were in was starting to
collapse.
   Medearis said Dyer, who was washed out of the building, told him
he kept trying to scramble to his knees as he tried to get back to
the others.
   ``He said he was submerged but then was able to see daylight,''
Medearis said.
   The molasses damaged four vehicles near the building, two of them
apparently rolled over by the wave.
   ``I just heard a big old boom, then I saw a wall of molasses that
carried those cars about 25 or 30 yards. It just picked them up and
slid them,'' said witness Paul Hansen.
   Medearis said the molasses was valued at $520,000. Today, Sagaser
estimated the total damage at $1 million. The cause of the collapse
was being investigated.
   Sagaser said the molasses is a by-product of its sugar refining
operations and is sold as a supplement for cattle feed.
   ``We just finished filling the tank a day or two ago,'' he said.
   The collapse of the tank should not hurt operations at any
Western Sugar plants, he added.
   A molasses tank that burst Jan. 15, 1919, in Boston killed 21
people and injured another 150. The steel tank containing 2.3
million gallons of the sticky goo broke open, unleashing 30-foot
waves of molasses.

   The Italian rock star Sabrina failed to impress
Moscow fans who paid up to $9 for a concert and ended up with only
six or seven songs in a 30-minute appearance, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
   At least 11 spectators at the Wednesday night concert were
injured when thousands of fans crowded onto a dance floor to get a
glimpse of the singer, the official Tass news agency said.
   The newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets said Sabrina arrived in
Moscow amid fanfare usually reserved for a real ``superstar,''
including six limousines, eight back-up sedans, a luxury suite at
the Cosmos Hotel and 70 bodyguards.
   ``Before the first show, Italians were strictly guarding and
nobody could lay a finger on Sabrina's equipment,'' the newspaper
said.
   With 22,000 fans waiting at the Olympic Hall, she failed to show
up on time, ``first washing her hair, then demanding a telephone
call to Italy and a vase with fruit and towels in her dressing
room,'' the newspaper said.
   ``After Sabrina appeared on the stage, the initial madness of
fans was replaced by a strange silence _ at first she sang some of
her own songs, then sensing the lack of enthusiasm, started to
repeat some old songs from the repetoires of some popular groups,''
the newspaper said. ``After 30 minutes, the concert was over.''
   As the fans left the concert hall, many were heard to mutter,
``Deceit!'' and ``Swindle!'' the newspaper's critic said.
   Noting the ticket prices of about $6.50 to $9 for six or seven
songs, ``isn't that a bit too expensive?'' the critic said.
   Tass said the 11 fans were injured ``when thousands of spectators
flooded the dance floor near the stage to catch a glimpse of the
curvaceous singer.''
   The news agency did not say if any of the injuries was serious.

   A Cincinnati Zoo cheetah which often is taken
to visit school classes or to meet with VIPs is meeting this weekend
with Britain's Prince Charles in Florida.
   Angel, an 8-year-old cheetah escorted on a leash by zoo handler
Cathryn Hilker, is to meet the prince during a weekend of events
including benefits to raise funds for Friends of Conservation to
save endangered animas in east Africa.
   Also to be introduced from the Cincinnati Zoo is Fiera the
ocelot, a spotted wild cat from South America, accompanied by zoo
staffer Cathy Tompson.
   ``The ocelot has become endangered because of the pet craze,''
Ms. Hilker said. ``When trappers find baby ocelots, they kill the
mother to take the babies for pet stores.''
   Socializing with celebrities isn't new for Angel. The cheetah has
already met actor Jimmy Stewart, former U.S. Interior Secretary
Donald Hodel, and Manuel Esquivel, prime minister of the Central
American country of Belize.
   ``Angel is bored by everybody,'' her trainer said. ``It's as if
she's saying, `Oh, gosh, here they come again.'''

   Comedian Gilda Radner should be out of the
hospital next week after surgery to correct complications of cancer
treatment, a hospital spokesman said.
   Miss Radner, 42, was in fair condition after the surgery
Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said the spokesman, Ron
Wise. Her comic-actor husband Gene Wilder, 53, was with her, Wise

   Wise called the surgery routine and said it corrected
complications stemming from cancer treatment Miss Radner had last
year. He declined to give precise information.
   Miss Radner, an original ``Saturday Night Live'' cast member, had
successfully battled ovarian cancer, diagnosed in 1986.
   ``The surgery definitely wasn't related to any malignancies,''
Wise said. ``Her physicians wanted her to wait until she was feeling
good and was strong enough. She's planning a book tour soon, so she
decided to have it done before the tour.''
   The actress was expected to launch her book, ``It's Always

   The State Department said today it was appalled
by the Iranian death threats against Salman Rushdie, the author of
``The Satanic Verses'' and denounced such actions as ``completely
irresponsible.''
   Ayatollah Khomeini called for Rushdie's death, and Iranian
religious leaders on Wednesday offered $2.6 million to any Iranian
and $1 million to any foreigner who killed the Rushdie, a Moslem
born in Bombay, India. The offer was doubled today to $5.2 million.
   Rushdie, who lives in London, has canceled a planned U.S.
promotional tour and gone into hiding because of the threats.
   ``We are appalled by the death threats against Salman Rushdie by
the Ayatollah Khomeini, as well as a subsequent offer of a reward
for his murder,'' said department spokesman Charles E. Redman.
   ``Such threats are completely irresponsible and are incompatible
with basic standards of international conduct,'' he added.
   Redman said he did not see how ``this in any way could improve
the prospects'' for U.S.-Iranian relations.
   Six people died in Pakistan during a weekend riot over the book,
which has been banned in most Islamic nations as well as many
countries with large Moslem populations.
   Moslem fundamentalist leaders in Iran said today that suicide
squads were preparing to carry out the ``death sentence'' imposed on
Rushdie and his publishers.

<HEAD>Government Eases `Zero Tolerance' Fishing Boat Seizure Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After complaints from boatmen and an order from
Congress, the government on Thursday relaxed its policy of
immediately seizing fishing boats on which a small amount of illegal
drugs is found.
   The interim modification would apply only to commercial fishing
vessels. But more changes in the year-old ``zero tolerance'' program
to combat drug smuggling may be made before formal guidelines are
issued, said Ed Callahan, a senior special agent with the Customs
Service.
   He said officials were discussing whether to extend less strict
procedures to other vessels, such as recreational craft and yachts
and other private boats.
   Under policies that went into effect last March, federal agents
were free to seize vessels within 12 miles of the U.S. coastline if
any amount of illegal drugs was found on board _ showing ``zero
tolerance.''
   Under the newly revized rules, Customs Service or Coast Guard
personnel would merely issue a summons to a commercial fishing
vessel if a personal-use amount of drugs was found while the ship
was engaged in fishing or en route to or from a fishing trip.
   Personal-use amounts generally are defined as no more than one
gram of heroin or cocaine or one ounce of marijuana.
   When large amounts are found, vessels could still be immediately
forfeited to the government, Callahan said.
   Some fishing vessels could be allowed to complete their fishing
expeditions, even if they lasted several days, and then surrender to
Customs authorities who would determine whether the vessels should
be seized or a fine imposed.
   The interim guidelines, which went into effect Thursday prior to
adoption of formal regulations expected in several weeks, also
require Customs to act within 20 days on petitions to return
vessels. Officials acknowledge that it has sometimes taken up to
several weeks for return of vessels where seizure was determine to
be unwarranted.
   The new guidelines followed meetings of Customs Commissioner
William von Raab with fisheries representatives. Von Raab signed an
agreement with the North Carolina and the East Coast Fisheries
associations in December calling for officials and the industry to
work together to see that vessels belonging to association members
are not used to transport illegal drugs into the United States.
   Late last year, Congress narrowly approved anti-drug law
modifications that instructed the executive branch to issue new
regulations that would not be so harsh in instances where a ship's
captain or owner may have no knowledge of a crewmember's possession
of a small quantity of an illegal substance.

<HEAD>Legal Error Could Cost Hughes Aircraft Up To $270 Million, Paper
Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The absence of four words in a legal
settlement could cost Hughes Aircraft Co. up to $270 million in its
18-year patent infringement lawsuit against the federal government,
a newspaper reported today.
   U.S. Claims Judge William Turner ruled that the omission of the
words ``except the United States'' in a 1987 out-of-court settlement
between Hughes and Ford Motor Co. freed the government from
liability regarding 13 government satellites built by a Ford
subsidiary, the Los Angeles Times reported.
   Turner's ruling, issued last September, was published recently in
the patent law journal U.S. Patent Quarterly.
   Hughes had sued both the government and Ford Aerospace, a unit of
Ford Motor Co., for patent infringement of a device used to control
orbiting satellites.
   However, Hughes and Ford settled out of court for $75 million in
September 1987, and the settlement absolved Ford customers from
liability. Because the United States was a Ford customer, and the
phrase ``except the United States'' was omitted from the settlement,
it cannot be held liable for the 13 satellites Ford Aerospace built
for it, Turner ruled.
   Hughes, an aerospace firm and subsidiary of General Motors Corp.,
claims the government used the orbiting control device on 108
satellites without paying required royalties. It is seeking $3.16
billion in damages, according to court documents.
   Government attorneys say Hughes has overblown its claims and that
it doesn't possess a valid patent.
   Hughes is seeking a 15 percent royalty of the cost of the
government satellites, in addition to other compensation. The
royalties and delay compensation on those 13 satellites represent
$270 million worth of claims against the government, according to a
secret court filing Hughes made Oct. 7, the newspaper reported.
   But under the Justice Department's method of valuing the
satellites, the 13 spacecraft might be worth only $50 million.
   Hughes officials refused to comment today because the matter
concerned litigation, said Mike Murphy, a spokesman at the company's
corporate headquarters. John Walker, managing partner at Latham &amp;
Watkins, the law firm representing Hughes in the case, said his firm
made no such error.

   Police questioned Ellen in a hospital
emergency room, and within minutes local radio stations were
broadcasting a description of the gunman she said threatened to kill
her if she didn't open a safe.
   A black man, about 5-foot-10 with a goatee, had demanded money
from Ellen, a nursing home receptionist who didn't want her last
name used for fear her assailant might be able to identify her.
   He wore a tan jacket, a blue polo shirt and red Puma tennis
shoes. He also had a tooth with a gold crown, listeners of Topeka's
five radio stations were told. Ellen said the man hit her on the
back of the head before fleeing without taking any cash.
   Interrupting programming to broadcast suspects' descriptions and
other information on armed robberies is part of a program called
Radio COP begun by the Police Department Feb. 1. Listeners are asked
to call police if they see a suspect or can provide other tips.
   ``Most crime prevention programs are reactive. This is
proactive,'' said Sgt. Richard Johnson, who developed Radio COP,
which stands for Call Our Police.
   As of Thursday, descriptions of five armed robberies had been
broadcast, at an average of eight minutes after the crime was
reported. No suspects have been arrested as a result of the
broadcasts, Johnson said, but police were pursuing one tip.
   Police suspect that a man charged in a convenience store hold-up
two days after the nursing home incident is Ellen's assailant. The
district attorney's office said Thursday charges were pending.
Because the man was arrested at the store, his description was not
aired again.
   Johnson said the broadcasts will make listeners more aware of
suspicious activity and may deter criminals from committing
robberies because they'll know 50,000 radio listeners will hear
about it.
   ``Creating an awareness is the most important part of it,''
Johnson said.
   In January, before Radio COP began, Topeka had 28 armed
robberies, more than double the number during the same period of
1987. Police will monitor robbery rates for the next few months to
evaluate the program's success.
   Radio COP is receiving praise from many sectors of the community,
including radio executives.
   ``I think it will be an asset not only to the police department
but to our station as well,'' said Cynthia Bervert, news director
for KTPK, a country music station. ``It will help keep us on top of
what's going on in Topeka.''
   One radio station balked at participating in the program, fearful
that it could be held liable if it disseminated incorrect
information. But disclaimers that tell listeners to call police if
they see a suspect and to not get involved personally were
strengthened, and the station joined the program by the time it
began.
   Johnson said he has received inquiries about Radio COP from as
far away as South Carolina and New York.
   ``We always tell people to report things, but we never tell them
what to report,'' Johnson said. ``This program does that.''

<HEAD>Bush Talks of Reducing Trade Barriers, Praises Yeutter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Thursday that he will press
a long-time U.S. quest to reduce world trade barriers and that
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter will help ``make sure our
objectives in agriculture are achieved.''
   Bush, at a ceremonial swearing-in for Yeutter, said he meant
business in a campaign promise to ``level the playing field'' so
that American products can flow freely in world trade.
   ``We've got to knock down barriers, and we will relentlessly
pursue negotiations to end subsidies that distort markets and that
restrict trade,'' the president said. ``Fair, free and open world
markets, that's what we want, that's what we're working for, and in
the end that's what we are determined to get.''
   Bush said that Yeutter's name ``rhymes with fighter'' and that he
is ``tough as nails, knowledgeable _ that's why I picked him. And I
know he's going to fight hard for farming, for fair trade and for
all the other important responsibilities for this department.''
   Yeutter, 58, who holds degrees in law and economics, is a native
of Nebraska and has held many public and private posts, including
Agriculture Department service in the early 1970s and president of
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange from 1978 to 1985.
   Bush said Yeutter had ``outstanding tenure'' for 3{ years as
President Reagan's trade representative. He said Yeutter will work
closely with Carla Hills, the new trade representative, to help
protect the interests of American farmers during multinational trade
talks.
   Yeutter was confirmed unanimously by the Senate on Feb. 8 and was
officially sworn in as secretary without ceremony later the same day
at the Agriculture Department.
   In Thursday's showcase event, which included a color guard,
Marine band and family members, Yeutter's repeated oath of office
was administered by Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who
also had sworn him in as trade representative in 1985.
   The audience included senior USDA officials, members of Congress,
several former secretaries of agriculture and a throng of White
House and departmental security people in addition to the news media.
   Bush said Yeutter ``is about to make an enduring commitment to
this department, and then told a story about a farmer making a
breakfast of eggs and bacon to show the difference between
involvement and commitment.
   ``The chicken is involved, but the pig is committed,'' Bush said.

<TEXT>
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos has
undergone surgery that determined that a tumor on a transplanted
kidney is benign, the Honolulu Advertiser reported Thursday.
   Surgeons on Tuesday removed tissue from the tumor during an
operation lasting more than an hour, the newspaper said. The
newspaper quoted unidentified sources close to Marcos as saying that
pathologists examined the tissue and determined that it was benign.
   The tumor was revealed during a CAT scan Friday.
   Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad confirmed the examination had
been performed, but said he did not know the results. Eugene
Tiwanak, assistant administrator of St. Francis Medical Center, said
he was unaware of the surgery or the CAT scan.
   Marcos remained in guarded condition in the hospital's intensive
care unit Thursday. He is breathing with the aid of a respirator, a
hospital spokesman said.
   Marcos was admitted to the hospital Jan. 15 for treatment of
pneumonia and bronchial asthma.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, were indicted last October on U.S.
racketeering charges accusing them of plundering the Philippine
economy of more than $100 million and stashing most of the money in
the United States.
   A federal judge in New York is to decide after a hearing next
month if Marcos is healthy enough to be arraigned. Mrs. Marcos was
arraigned last year in New York.
   The Marcoses have lived in exile in Honolulu since February 1986,
when a civilian-military revolt ended their 20-year rule and
catapulted President Corazon Aquino to power.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of foreign visitors to the United
States rose 14 percent last year, with much of the increased traffic
coming from Europe and Japan, the government reported Thursday.
   The U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration estimated that visits
to the United States for business and pleasure reached a record 33.7
million in 1988.
   Tourism is expected to continue to grow in the next two years,
but at a slower rate. The agency projects 35.8 million foreign
visitors in 1989, up 6 percent from last year, and 37.2 million in
1990, up 4 percent from this year.
   The biggest share of foreign visits to the United States comes
from Canada. Some 13.7 million Canadians visited last year, up 10
percent from 1987.
   Visits by Europeans increased 24 percent last year to 5.8
million, with the increase paced by a 34 percent jump in visits from
Britian. Visits from Japan also were up 24 percent, to 2.6 million.
   The tourism administration said factors contributing to the
increases last year included more aggressive marketing of U.S.
destinations, the cheaper U.S. dollar in relation to foreign
currencies, and healthy economic conditions abroad.
   The biggest growth markets for 1989 again are expected to be
Britain and Japan. The Japanese government is encouraging citizens
to travel abroad as a means of reducing the country's world trade
surplus.
   The tourism administration expects visits from Japan to increase
22 percent in 1989 to 3.2 million, and visits from Britian to
increase 13 percent to 2.1 million.
   Spending by foreign visitors to the United States was up 26
percent to $24.4 billion in 1988, but still was exceeded by the
amount spent by Americans traveling abroad, leaving an $8.1 billion
deficit. That deficit was down 18 percent from the previous year.
   U.S. receipts from foreign visitors are expected to rise 11
percent this year to $27.1 billion.
   ``Although we are still in a deficit situation, travel and
tourism is our largest service sector export, and the deficit is
growing smaller evey year,'' said Don Wynegar, director of the
tourism administration's Office of Research.
   The administration, responsible for increasing tourism as an
export in international trade, has developed a marketing program to
attract a bigger share of the growing numbers of Japanese tourists.
   ``Now that the Japanese government has developed a program to
send more citizens abroad as a means of reducing its worldwide trade
surplus, the U.S. must respond quickly to attract its fair share of
the market,'' said Max Ollendorff, the agency's director of market
development.
   The program focuses on improving group tours, developing new
tours and improving attractions in the cities where most Japanese
visitors arrive. Most Japanese prefer group tours, and many enjoy
parks, mountain regions and the American West, the administration
said.

   Conservation groups asked the Bush
administration Thursday to declare the African elephant an
endangered species, saying the giant animals could face extinction
because of ivory poaching.
   The Asian elephant is already classed as an endangered species
under U.S. law. The African kind is considered only as threatened.
Upgrading its status would in effect cut off U.S. imports of ivory,
said Craig Van Note, who heads Monitor, an association of 32 groups.
   ``We think the president will be personally interested; he's an
outdoorsman,'' Van Note said. ``We know Secretary of State (James
A.) Baker has taken a personal interest.''
   A formal 39-page petition was prepared for presentation to the
new secretary of the interior, Manuel J. Lujan Jr.
   The coalition said there were 1.3 million elephants in Africa in
1981, but are fewer than 500,000 now.
   ``Experts have predicted that the African elephant may become
virtually extinct in as little as 10 years unless ivory poaching is
stopped,'' the Humane Society of the United States said in a
statement.
   ``Africa's remaining elephants cannot wait,'' the petition said.
   One major conservation group that did not join in the peititon
was the World Wildlife Fund.
   Curtis Bohlen, its senior vice president, said African countries
would find it offensive if the United States banned all imports.
   ``We don't think it's the best way to solve the problem,'' he
said in a telephone interview. ``We only import 10 percent of the
ivory.''
   A much larger proportion is imported into Japan and stays there,
he added. But he said Japan's imports have dropped and its
government is taking drastic new measures to import only legal ivory.
   Bohlen said he favored a trial period for a U.S. law that went
into effect last October, which provides for a halt of ivory imports
from any country not trying to control the illegal slaughter of
elephants. He said world trade has dropped to 80 tons a year from an
an average of 400 to 600 tons.

<HEAD>IRS to Help Americans Abroad Prepare Their Tax Returns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service announced Thursday
that it is sending workers to 143 cities in 80 countries to help
Americans abroad prepare their 1988 tax returns.
   At the same time, the IRS said it is intensifying efforts to
reduce the number of U.S. citizens living abroad who don't even
bother to file a return. The agency estimates 3 million live in
foreign countries, including retirees and dependents with no income,
but only 900,000 filed returns last year.
   ``We feel there is a big tax gap there,'' Donald Houck, assistant
commissioner for international operations, told reporters.
   Later this year, Houck said, the IRS expects to have in operation
a computer program that will match the names of Americans applying
for passports against the master list of those filing returns. Those
who receive passports but don't file will have to explain why.
   The IRS provided mail, telephone or on-the-spot assistance to
about one-third of those Americans abroad who filed returns last
year. An estimated 5,000 volunteers trained by the IRS helped 30,000
U.S. taxpayers stationed at foreign military installations.
   Houck said that because of budgetary restraints, the IRS had to
postpone opening a toll-free telephone assistance line for Americans
abroad. The line will be opened, starting in Canada and Europe, in
1991, he said.
   Many Americans working in a foreign country may avoid tax on up
to $70,000 earned each year, if they spend enough time abroad, but
they still are required to file a return. Houck cautioned that the
exclusion is not available to employees of the U.S. government or to
members of the military.
   Independent contractors who supply services to the U.S.
government may be eligible for the exclusion if they meet certain
requirements. But the exclusion is not available to workers who are
paid from non-appropriated funds, such as employees of service clubs
or military post exchanges.
   The IRS estimates there are as many as 40,000 such employees. The
agency has assessed additional taxes averaging $4,000 against more
than 600 who erroneously claimed the foreign-earnings exclusion.
Houck said these audits have the potential for $30 million in
deficiencies.
   Schedules for the visit of IRS employees to foreign countries are
posted in U.S. embassies and consulates and, for military personnel,
with the office of the judge advocate general.

   Media and volunteer service organizations
announced on Thursday a national campaign to encourage more
Americans to volunteer to help young people.
   The campaign, called ``Unsung Americans,'' will use television
and radio public service messages in conjunction with a referral
service to direct citizens to local volunteer agencies.
   ``There is every indication that the time is ripe for this kind
of an effort, given the emphasis on volunteerism in this country,''
said James E. Duffy, president of communications for Capital
Cities@ABC Inc.
   He pointed to President Bush's call for increased volunteerism in
connection with his ``thousand points of light'' theme.
   The Unsung Americans campaign will build upon experience gained
from ABC's partnership with the Public Broadcasting Service in
Project Literacy U.S., or PLUS, an effort launched in December 1985
to raise awareness of the problem of illiteracy in this country.
   ``Studies have shown a strong correlation, a real link, between
the lack of basic skills among young people and the major problems
that they face today _ teen pregnancy, dropping out of school,
substance abuse, unemployment and delinquency,'' Duffy told a news
conference.
   He noted that ``raising basic skills is a key entry point to
creating solutions to these problems. It is not a panacea, but it is
an important and a fundamental approach.''
   Other organizations joining with ABC and PBS in the Unsung
Americans campaign include:
   _VOLUNTEER, a national volunteer group based in suburban
Arlington, Va., that aims to stimulate and strengthen volunteer
citizen involvement.
   _Education Commission of the States, based in Denver, an
interstate compact that helps state leaders improve the quality of
education.
   _National Collaboration for Youth, based in Washington, made up
of 15 national youth-serving organizations that banded together to
help improve conditions affecting young people.
   _Contact Center Inc., located in Lincoln, Neb., which operates a
national telephone referral service for dealing with various social
problems.
   The Unsung Americans public service messages on TV and radio will
utilize a toll-free number, 1-800-228-8813. Viewers and listeners
calling the number for information will be referred by the Contact
Center to volunteer organizations in their own communities.
   Former Michigan Gov. George Romney, chairman of VOLUNTEER, said
the Unsung Americans effort was timely because ``volunteering is the
most effective and least costly way of solving problems. There is no
substitute for the caring volunteer who is capable and willing to
help another individual, with a problem, to help themselves.''
   He added that ``experience has shown that the most effective way
of saving a teen-ager headed down the wrong road _ toward crime or
drug abuse _ is to introduce in their life a caring adult role
model. It is not just an answer, it is the only answer.''

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-apartheid leaders gave an
unprecedented rebuke to Winnie Mandela on Thursday, saying she has
betrayed the trust of the black community and kept bodyguards who
waged a ``reign of terror'' in Soweto.
   The influential activists accused Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and once called the
``Mother of the Nation,'' of ``violating human rights ... in the
name of the struggle against apartheid.''
   The strongly worded statement was the first public repudiation of
Mrs. Mandela by the senior leadership of the anti-apartheid
movement. They accused her of complicity in the abduction and
assault of a 14-year-old black activist, Stompie Seipei, whose
decomposed body was found dumped in Soweto last month.
   Mrs. Mandela, in the few public statements she has made, denied
she was at home when the teen-ager and four men were abducted to her
house on Dec. 29 by members of a so-called soccer team known as
Mandela United who act as her unofficial bodyguards. But she has
defended the abduction, saying the four were taken to protect them
from sexual abuse at a Methodist church residence where they were
staying in Soweto.
   The church has denied the charge, and the anti-apartheid leaders
made their denunciation of Mrs. Mandela at the Central Methodist
Church in Johannesburg.
   Tom Sebina, a spokesman for the African National Congress, said
from the organization's Lusaka, Zambia, headquarters that ANC
leaders were concerned at reports linking Mrs. Mandela with the
boy's death.
   Asked if Mrs. Mandela was present when Stompie was abducted,
Sebina said: ``Everybody at home believes so.''
   The ANC has called on Mrs. Mandela to disband the soccer team.
   Leaders of the banned United Democratic Front, the nation's
largest opposition coalition, joined prominent anti-apartheid
lawyers and officials of the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
the largest black labor federation, in reaffirming their allegiance
to Mandela while distancing themselves from his wife.
   Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, said he did not believe his client
had been informed of the statement.
   Mandela, 70, has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-run
government.
   ``We are outraged at Mrs. Mandela's complicity in the recent
abductions and assault of Stompie,'' the anti-apartheid leaders
said. ``Had Stompie and his three colleagues not been abducted by
Mrs. Mandela's 'football team,' he would have been alive today.''
   Police this week identified Stompie's body in a Soweto morgue and
opened a murder investigation when stab wounds were found in his
neck.
   Police also are investigating the murders of a Mandela United
member found hacked to death in Soweto this week, and a prominent
anti-apartheid physician who reportedly saw Stompie after he had
been beaten.
   Maj.-Gen. Jaap Joubert, who is heading the investigations, said
police also are looking for two young Soweto men who have been
missing since November, after last being seen in the company of
members of the soccer team.
   The investigations are the latest in a series of controversies
involving Mrs. Mandela, 54, in the three years since the government
removed all restrictions on her activities and ended the ban on
quoting her. Many black activists used to call her ``Mother of the
Nation,'' but her erratic behavior and reluctance to consult with
black leaders have alienated many supporters.
   ``Mrs. Mandela has abused the trust and confidence which she has
enjoyed over the years,'' said Murphy Morobe of the United
Democratic Front.
   ``Numerous efforts have been made to reconcile the conflict
between Mrs. Mandela and the (black) community,'' he said. ``On
every occasion Mrs. Mandela has refused to cooperate and has chosen
to disregard the sentiments of the community.''
   Morobe noted that Mrs. Mandela has faced severe hardships, such
as being separated from her husband for 27 years, raising her two
daughters alone, living under harsh police restrictions, and
spending 18 months in solitary confinement without charge.
   He said it had been painful for black leaders to speak out
against Mrs. Mandela, and conceded the government would use the
criticism as a ``propaganda point.''
   But he said her actions repeatedly violated the ``spirit and
ethos'' of the anti-apartheid movement, which seeks to end South
Africa's system of legalized race discrimination.
   ``We are outraged by the reign of terror that the team has been
associated with,'' Morobe said. ``Not only is Mrs. Mandela
associated with the team, in fact, the team is her own creation.''
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said in Cape Town he has ``a
high regard'' for Mrs. Mandela and hoped that something could be
done to reconcile her with the Soweto community. Although the
allegations about abduction and assault have not been proven in
court, Tutu said, ``Enough has surfaced to make it evident that
there is enough truth to make it uncomfortable.''
   Mrs. Mandela issued no response to the denunciation, would not
take phone calls, and refused to talk to journalists who went to her
Soweto office.

   The International Committee of the Red
Cross reopened its offices Thursday in south Lebanon after a
two-month closure following the kidnapping of a Swiss delegate.
   Red Cross deputy delegate Mohammed Bizri said two Swiss delegates
identified as Daniel Philippin and Christophe Girod restarted
operations in the southern port cities of Sidon and Tyre.
   Girod, who headed the Red Cross office in Tyre before the
closure, was among the nine Red Cross personnel who pulled out of
Lebanon on Dec. 9, when the mission suspended its operations in the
south following the abduction of Peter Winkler.
   Winkler, 32, was grabbed by unidentified gunmen in Sidon, 25
miles from Beirut, on Nov. 17. He was freed one month later.

   President Ranasinghe Premadasa's United
National Party won a decisive majority in Parliament after an
election campaign in which more than 1,000 people were killed,
according to results announced Thursday.
   ``The people have exercised their vote in the face of great
adversity. The people have totally rejected the path of violence,''
the president said shortly after the results of Wednesday's vote
were announced.
   Despite death threats and assassinations by Sinhalese extremists
and Tamil separatists trying to halt the elections, about 63 percent
of Sri Lanka's 9.3 million eligible voters cast ballots.
   ``This is the spirit that will restore democracy,'' Premadasa
said in a nationally televised speech. ``The time for national
reconstruction has begun. The agenda is clear: We must restore law
and order.''
   His party won 125 seats in the 225-member Parliament. The chief
opposition group, former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike's Sri
Lanka Freedom Party, captured 67 seats, Tamils won 23 seats, and the
rest went to small parties and independents.
   Premadasa, who won presidential elections two months ago, failed
to secure the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution
and key laws. That could hamstring legislation needed to implement
his ambitious anti-poverty program, which he considers vital for
ending sectarian violence that has killed at least 10,000 people in
the past six years.
   Premadasa, Mrs. Bandaranaike and the majority of their followers
are Sinhalese, the largest ethnic group on this Indian Ocean island.
   Comprising 75 percent of the country's 16 million people, the
Sinhalese dominate the government, military and economic
infrastructure. Tamils, a minority of 18 percent, claim they are
discriminated against, and the most radical members of their
community have been waging a separatist war since 1983.
   The Tamil winners included 13 members of the Eeelam Revolutionary
Organization of Students, a former underground militia that was
involved in the guerrilla war.
   Soldiers and police enforced a strict curfew imposed Thursday
morning after Sinhalese extremists shot and killed five Sri Lankan
soldiers and wounded four policemen in attacks on army and police
posts in southern and central Sri Lanka.
   Police blamed the attacks on the People's Liberation Front,
composed of militant Sinhalese who believe the government has made
too many concessions to Tamils.
   The police blamed 47 of the 56 election-day killings on the
front. They said security forces killed seven Sinhalese extremists
who tried to attack polling places, and they blamed the other two
deaths on Tamil guerrillas.
   Premadasa's party, which held 139 of the old Parliament's 168
seats, scored most of its heaviest victories in its ethnic
constituency, the Sinhalese heartland. It captured only one seat in
Northern province, which is almost totally Tamil. It won five seats
in Eastern province, where the population is about evenly divided
among Sinhalese, Tamils and Moslems.

   Anti-abortion activists who unsuccessfully
fought to block an abortion on a comatose woman continue to press
their case, hoping they can win the war even though they lost the
battle.
   They persisted this week in asking the full U.S. Supreme Court
for a stay, even though Nancy Klein's pregnancy was terminated after
Justice Thurgood Marshall refused to intervene.
   The activists hope eventually to argue the merits of the case
before the justices ``so that something like the Klein case cannot
happen again,'' said one of the attorneys in the case, A. Lawrence
Washburn.
   ``I hurt in my gut because of the loss of that infant,'' said
Washburn.
   It was not the first time Washburn has become involved in a
headline-making right-to-life case. In 1983, he tried, also without
success, to intervene in a parental decision in the case of a
severely deformed Long Island infant known as Baby Jane Doe.
   He vowed that the setback in the Klein case will not stop him,
and like many abortion opponents he is hopeful that the Supreme
Court will reverse its 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   Mrs. Klein, a 32-year-old free-lance fashion designer from Upper
Brookville, fell into a coma after suffering brain damage in a car
accident Dec. 13. Her husband, Martin, was told by doctors that she
would have a better chance of survival if the fetus she was carrying
was aborted.
   When Klein went to court, seeking guardianship of his wife so he
could authorize an abortion, Washburn represented Syosset lawyer
John J. Broderick in an opposing petition for guardianship of the
fetus. Another abortion opponent, John Short of Farmingdale, and
attorney Mary Spaulding took a different legal tack, seeking
guardianship of Mrs. Klein.
   Broderick, Short and their lawyers were able to delay the
abortion three times with appeals.
   At each step, the New York courts rejected their petitions, until
a last-ditch plea to the U.S. Supreme Court for an emergency stay
was refused. The abortion was performed Saturday on Mrs. Klein, who
was 18 weeks pregnant.
   Along the way, the anti-abortion activists and their attorneys
weathered severe criticism, including abusive, anonymous messages
left on Short's answering machine.
   At one point during the legal struggle, Klein said: ``Our family
is beaten down. We're torn up. These strangers have come off the
street and are intruding in our lives. We don't know what to do
about it.''
   The Appellate Division of state Supreme Court agreed, saying,
``These absolute strangers to the Klein family, whatever their
motivation, have no place in the midst of this family tragedy.''
   Washburn and Short said they sympathized with the Klein family _
the couple also have a 3-year-old child _ and respect their privacy.
But both said they could not condone abortion by being silent.
   ``We have a much larger family _ the human family,'' said Short.
   ``I don't care what they call me,'' Washburn said in an interview.
   Washburn, a father of six and grandfather of 24, said he became
involved in the anti-abortion movement in 1970, when New York
legalized abortion.
   ``My sister, who died of cancer in 1977, urged me to get in and
try to protect the rights of those who cannot protect themselves,''
said Washburn. ``I've been doing it ever since.''
   He gained wide recognition in 1983 in the case of Baby Jane Doe.
The infant's parents opted against surgery for her; Washburn,
convinced that the parents were refusing surgery because they wanted
the child to die, took them to court.
   Eventually, the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals,
sided with the parents and dismissed Washburn's suit as
``distressing and offensive.'' The parents agreed to the surgery
months later, and the child is still alive.
   Washburn has had some success in court. In 1980, he helped
persuade the Supreme Court to uphold the power of Congress to
withhold federal funds for abortion unless the life of the mother is
threatened by the pregnancy.
   Short has his own long record of anti-abortion activism. In 1972,
he was fired as an accountant for Nassau County after he refused to
process Medicaid claims for elective abortions at the county medical
center.
   In 1975, Washburn represented Short in a suit against the Nassau
County Medical Center. The suit claimed the hospital allowed doctors
to perform abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy and let the fetuses
die, which hospital officials denied.
   As a result of the case, a federal judge appointed Short legal
guardian of any live fetus at the medical center, a guardianship he
never has exercised.
   ``I see myself as the godfather of the unwanted,'' said Short,
father of five.
   ``Whenever we see anyone being forced into a tragedy we have to
stand up and be counted,'' he said. ``The most terrible tragedy is
someone killing their own child.''

<TEXT>
   A woman who baked 106 Valentine's Day
cupcakes for her sons' classmates said school officials turned away
the treats because they feared the spread of AIDS, but officials
denied her claim.
   Edwina Hatzenbuehler said she was first told by the kindergarten
teacher of her son Mark's class at Monroe Elementary School that the
cupcakes had to be declined for ``health reasons.''
   She said Principal Corrine Law later told her the school had a
policy against distribution of homemade food, possibly because it
could have been made in a ``dirty house'' and threatened spread of
diseases such as AIDS.
   ``Everybody in that school knows me,'' Hatzenbuehler said
Wednesday. ``It really just hurt my feelings. I told her you can't
spread AIDS by cupcakes.''
   Law denied mentioning AIDS or ``dirty'' houses when explaining
the policy to Hatzenbuehler, but said the policy resulted from
general concerns about health.
   Store-bought food is allowed because preparation is supervised by
health agencies, Law said.
   There is no scientific evidence that the AIDS virus can be
transmitted through food, said Faith Davis, a senior communicable
disease specialist for the AIDS unit of the Riverside County Health
Department. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles
or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   Law said the school's policy, adopted last September, was a
decision by the school staff and Parent-Teacher Association. Besides
health considerations, parents showing up with homemade goodies were
disrupting instruction, Law said.
   Distribution of store-bought treats has been put under the
coordination of room mothers, the principal said. Hatzenbuehler is
not a room mother.
   ``We try very hard not to offend any parent, but we have to ...
act on what is best for the children,'' said Joan Shurtliff,
assistant superintendent for the Riverside Unified School District.

   Two patients contracted Legionnaires'
disease while being treated in a hospital for other illnesses, a
hospital spokeswoman said Thursday.
   All water supplies at the Queen Elizabeth hospital are being
tested and an internal investigation has been ordered, said a
hospital spokeswoman. An independent inquiry also will be launched,
said a regional health official.
   A middle-age man contracted Legionnaires' disease after a liver
transplant and died on Jan. 29 from other causes, the hospital said.
A woman is being treated in the hospital for Legionnaires' disease,
the spokeswoman said.
   No other details on the patients were released.
   ``It is almost certain that they contracted the disease while in
hospital,'' said hospital bacteriologist Dr. Tom Elliott.
   Officials said Wednesday that a second man had died from an
outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in central London. Health
officials said 14 other people were suffering from the disease and
47 others were suspected of having it.
   The pneumonia-like disease is carried by bacteria found in soil
and in the water of air-conditioning ducts, storage tanks and rivers.

   A three-week storm with winds of up to
115 mph and 43-foot waves has forced a state-owned company to
suspend oil production from a major offshore field, the company said
Thursday.
   The storm has made it impossible for tankers to moor at the
loading buoys at the Statfyord oil field, said Statoil company
spokesman Haakon Lavik.
   Lavik said gas production has also been reduced.
   The field normally produces 700,000 barrels of oil daily. Statoil
said it will supply its European oil and gas customers from other

<TEXT>
   James Bond, an ornithologist whose name was
adopted for the fictional British agent 007 in Ian Fleming's novels,
has died. He was 89.
   He died Tuesday at Chestnut Hill Hospital, where officials
refused to release the cause of death.
   Bond, former curator of ornithology at the Academy of Natural
Sciences, was the leading authority on birds of the West Indies for
more than half a century and is best known scientifically for
proving that birds of the Caribbean originated in North America, not
South America.
   In recognition of this discovery, the geographic line dividing
Caribbean birds of North American ancestry from those of South
American origins has been called ``Bond's Line.''
   Bond's contribution to popular culture came after World War II
when Fleming saw his book, ``Birds of the West Indies.'' Fleming, a
bird watcher, was writing a thriller at the time and adopted the
name for the dashing character portrayed in movies by Sean Connery,
Roger Moore and other actors.
   ``It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet
very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James
Bond was born,'' Fleming wrote years later to Bond's wife, Mary
Fanning Wickham Bond.
   ``In return I can only offer you or James Bond unlimited use of
the name Ian Fleming for any purposes you may think fit,'' he wrote.
``Perhaps one day your husband will discover a particularly horrible
species of bird which he would like to christen in an insulting
fashion by calling it Ian Fleming.''
   Fleming died in 1964.
   The ornithologist Bond, a native of Philadelphia, earned a
bachelor's degree at Cambridge University and made his first
scientific expedition in 1925 when he traveled up the Amazon River
to collect bird skins and live animals for the academy.
   He visited more than 100 Caribbean islands, collected all but six
of the 300 bird species living there and wrote more than 100
scientific papers and four books on Caribbean birds.
   Among his scientific honors were the Musgrave Medal from the
Institute of Jamaica in 1952; the Brewster Medal, the highest honor
of the American Ornithologists' Union, in 1954; and the Leidy Medal
of the Academy of Natural Sciences in 1975.
   He is survived by his wife, a stepdaughter and six
stepgrandchildren.
   A memorial service will be held Saturday in Chestnut Hill.

   Gunmen lined up patrons against
a bar Thursday at a Protestant clubhouse and opened fire with
assault rifles, injuring five people, police said.
   A splinter group of the Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility.
   The incident occurred at midday at the Orange Cross Social Club,
a drinking spot in the predominantly Protestant Shankill district of
Belfast, police said.
   A witness told London Broadcasting Corp. radio that three
attackers lined up some men against the bar and opened fire with
Kalashnikov assault rifles.
   ``They singled out a few men on the premises, put them against
the bar, and started to shoot indiscriminately,'' said the witness,
who was not identified.
   Nearby Mater Hospital said it admitted one man in serious
condition with head injuries and two with serious chest wounds. Two
women were in stable condition with stomach injuries.
   The Irish National Liberation Army, a small offshoot of the
predominantly Catholic Irish Republican Army, claimed responsibility
in a statement to Belfast news media. It said it was avenging recent
attacks on Catholics.
   Three Catholics were killed in separate attacks earlier this
week, and Protestant extremists claimed responsibility for two of
the deaths.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the province with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.

   Oliver North's lawyers said today a plan worked
out between Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and prosecutors would
``impose intolerable burdens'' in the Iran-Contra case, but the
independent counsel prosecuting North denied the assertion.
   North's attorneys, Brendan Sullivan and Barry Simon, filed a
motion seeking rejection of the plan to protect classified material
detailed Wednesday by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
   Under that plan, drawn up to reflect a court order issued Tuesday
by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, the independent counsel
said he will, if necessary, seek an affidavit from the attorney
general to prevent the disclosure by North of classified information
that could harm national security.
   The defense motion was filed a few hours after Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist lifted an order that had delayed the start of
the trial. Thornburgh said he is satisfied with arrangements for
handling state secrets that North wants to make public.
   ``The court's oral ruling and its subsequent written order were
clearly intended to exclude the AG (attorney general) entirely from
the trial process,'' Sullivan and Simon said in their motion.
   They said that each time the court rules admissible an item of
information falling within nine categories specified by the judge's
order, ``the trial will come to a halt'' while Walsh sends word to
Thornburgh.
   North's lawyers said Walsh's plan contemplates that Thornburgh
would be permitted to intervene in the trial through ``bits and
pieces of affidavit,'' an approach that the judge rejected Tuesday.
   Walsh's plan would ``cripple'' North's right to cross-examine
prosecution witnesses and to present his case and ``would impose
intolerable burdens on the court, the witnesses, and the jurors,''
they contended.
   Gesell did not comment on Walsh's plan.
   Walsh said in a response that the ``independent counsel does not
contemplate the trifling `bits and pieces' activity by the attorney
general'' which North anticipates, adding:
   ``The day-to-day conduct of this case will be by the independent
counsel and only the independent counsel.''
   Meantime, he called a closed hearing this afternoon to discuss
disclosures of the Reagan administration's offer of inducements to
third countries to funnel support to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels
during a time when Congress had banned aid to them.
   At the hearing, Gesell was to consider the proposed text of what
the government is willing to admit at North's trial about the quid
pro quo arrangements, which defense lawyers say are at ``the heart
of the case.''
   On Monday, Sullivan asserted that then-President Reagan
personally participated in a plan to offer favors to third countries
willing to support the Contras and that Reagan and other top
administration officials then agreed to cover up the arrangements.
   The government is willing to make limited disclosures about the
matter, but North's lawyers want to delve into it in greater detail
at his trial.
   Rehnquist, in a brief order this morning, lifted a stay he had
granted the government on Sunday. The Justice Department says
adequate safeguards to prevent disclosure of national security
secrets at the trial are in place and there no longer is a need to
hold up the proceedings.
   Thornburgh on Wednesday accepted an order from Gesell barring the
attorney general from filing affidavits continuously during the
trial objecting to individual pieces of classified material that
North wants to introduce in his defense.
   Walsh made it easier for Thornburgh to accept Gesell's order.
Walsh devised a plan saying that he will, if necessary, seek an
affidavit from the attorney general to prevent the disclosure during
the trial of classified information that could harm national
security.
   Walsh's statement added that he ``is prepared to discharge his
responsibility'' under Gesell's order.
   Thornburgh said Walsh's promise ``provides the government with
the substance of what we have been seeking for the past week.''
   As he left work, Thornburgh told reporters he was satisfied
because ``the independent counsel has agreed to be my
representative'' on all secrecy matters in the trial.
   Late Wednesday, Acting Solicitor General William C. Bryson filed
papers asking that the stay issued by Rehnquist be lifted.
   ``In light of the district court's order and the report of the
independent counsel, the attorney general believes that the concerns
that gave rise to the relief from this court have been satisfied,''
the department said in its brief.
   North is accused of shredding evidence and lying to Congress to
cover up the Reagan administration's attempts to help the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels during a period in which Congress had banned direct
U.S. aid.

<HEAD>Letters, Papers From Howard Hughes To Be Auctioned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Letters from Howard Hughes to a onetime key aide
and other items linked to the late billionaire will go on the
auction block this weekend in what is billed as the first sale of
its kind.
   Most of the memorabilia to be sold belonged to the late R.C.
Kuldell, who tended to the business of Hughes Tool Co. in Houston
during the late 1930s while his young and flamboyant boss was in
Hollywood making movies and headlines.
   ``While Howard was out playing, Kuldell was in Houston making
money hand over fist for him,'' said Ray Simpson, owner of the
company handling the sale. About 65 items will be auctioned at
Simpson's auction house Sunday.
   Besides the Kuldell items, the sale will include a shotgun that
the Hughes, an industrialist, aviation pioneer and film producer, is
said to have carried with him on a record-breaking, round-the-world
airplane flight in 1938, a hat and scarf he purportedly once wore,
several rare posters of movies he made and three schoolbooks he used
as a child.
   Hughes led a much-publicized life as a young man, but he later
became obsessively reclusive. He died in 1976 at age 70 while on a
chartered flight from Acapulco to Houston for medical treatment.
   Simpson said a letter from Hughes signed simply ``Howard'' sold
for $1,000 at an auction in New York three years ago, but there has
not been a public sale that consisted exclusively of Hughes
memorabilia.
   Notarized letters will support the authenticity of Hughes' link
to all the items, most which are owned by Houston entrepreneur Bob
Kuldell, R.C.'s son, Simpson said. The elder Kuldell died in 1973.
   ``I thought other people could use these things more than I could
right now,'' Bob Kuldell said in explaining why he decided to sell.
   R.C. Kuldell was hired by Hughes' father, Howard Hughes Sr., and
went to work for Hughes Tool, now Baker Hughes Tool Co., in 1920. He
continued to work there after the elder Hughes died in 1924 and
18-year-old Howard Jr. became his boss.
   ``Dad had a very good rapport with Howard,'' the younger Kuldell
said. ``He loved him like a son.''
   R.C. Kuldell retired from Hughes Tool in 1939 at age 52, after a
corporate power struggle with a Hughes adviser, his son said. But
Kuldell kept in touch with Hughes until his death in 1973, his son
said.
   One of the items to be auctioned is a solid gold, custom-made
pocket watch Hughes gave to Kuldell with both men's initials
inscribed on the back. Kuldell's son said ``he treasured that watch
more than anything.''
   Ordinarily, such a watch would sell for at least $10,000, but it
is expected to fetch a higher price because of the history behind
it, Simpson said. In all, the items could bring as much as $100,000,
he said.
   Simpson said that after word got out about the auction, several
other people called wanting to sell their Hughes memorabilia.
   One consigner is selling three schoolbooks that belonged to
Hughes, found in an attic of a home 40 years ago.
   Folded up in one of the books is a drawing of a boy in a car that
has an airplane propeller on the end. And in one composition book,
an 8-year-old Hughes writes about his 1913 Christmas.
   ``I hung my stocking and tried to make mother hang hers up, but
she would not do it. I went to bed but could not go to sleep for a
long time. I got up the next day and went downstairs. I thought
there was too much for me. I had a nice Christmas.''
   Simpson expects about 500 people to attend the auction.

   President Bush on Thursday made a pitch for
Atlanta to be the host for the summer Olympic Games in 1996.
   Bush met briefly with Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain, president
of the International Olympic Committee, and representatives of an
Atlanta group promoting the Southern city for the event.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush wanted to ``extol
the virtues of Atlanta and the United States and point out that we
would love to have the Olympics here.''
   Samaranch, talking to reporters in the White House driveway
afterward, said the committee would choose the site for the 1996
Games during a meeting in Tokyo in September 1990.
   Several other countries are competing for the Games.
   Samaranch said that Atlanta would be given full consideration and
said that Bush had told his visitors he was sure that Atlanta
``would be the best place to hold the Games.''
   The IOC president said that ``I'm very impressed with the city
and with the people'' seeking to host the summer Games.

   President Bush today called upon the Soviet
Union to refrain from interfering in Afghanistan now that Red Army
troops have departed and said he hoped the country could come
together ``with no more bloodbaths.''
   The president also expressed reservations about an agreement
reached by five Central American presidents to disarm the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua. ``There's some positive elements to what's
taking place there. There also are some troublesome elements,'' he
said.
   The president said ``I have every intention'' of seeing the
Nicaraguan rebels continue to receive humanitarian aid.
   Bush said ``I think we have to be wary'' about whether Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega will carry out his promises for democratic
reforms.
   The president made his comments in a wide-ranging interview with
a small group of reporters invited into the Oval Office.

<HEAD>Corncob Fibers To Be Processed Into Fiber Boost For Food</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fibers that keep corn on the cob, best
known for sticking between the teeth, will soon be marketed to give
a fiber boost to bread, snacks and other foods.
   Mount Pulaski Products, using a process developed by government
scientists, plans to make high-fiber flour from the corncob material
in about six months.
   ``Our product has the ability to go into any food _ pudding, ice
cream, all baked goods, even junk food,'' said company President R.
Scott Steinfort. ``Anywhere you want to increase fiber and reduce
calories. The potential is astronomical.''
   The new process will create a market for part of the corn plant
that farmers produce, but don't sell, said J. Michael Gould, a U.S.
Department of Agriculture scientist who helped develop the process
at a laboratory in Peoria.
   The treated fiber is dried and ground and used to replace some of
the conventional flour in breads, cakes and doughnuts. The material
could increase the fiber content of baked goods by up to 30 percent
without altering the taste or adding calories, Gould said.
   ``We found we could make a white bread that looks, feels and
tastes like any other white bread but which has as much dietary
fiber as whole wheat bread,'' he said.
   Soluble fibers, such as those found in oat bran and most fruits,
have been linked with lower blood cholesterol levels, according to
Kay Behall, a USDA nutritionist in Beltsville, Md.
   The fiber in corncobs, and in most brans, is insoluble, ``but
insoluble fiber is known to reduce likelihood and severity of
constipation, diverticulitis and irritable bowel syndromes such as
colitis,'' she said.
   Gould said the process involves the use of hydrogen peroxide to
soften fibrous plant material and make it more palatable. Otherwise,
consumers complain that the fiber creates a gritty texture, he said.
   Mount Pulaski Products, which paid a $50,000 fee for the
technology, expects to buy corncobs and other plant material from
farmers near its headquarters in Mount Pulaski in central Illinois.
   The company already processes corncobs into a material used in
polishing agents and other industrial products.

   Reading from notes at the beginning of his meeting with the
press, Bush said, ``We support the Afghan efforts to fashion a
stable, broadly based government responsive to the needs of the
Afghan people.''
   He said the U.S. commitment to the Afghan people ``will remain
and will remain firm, both through our bilateral humanitarian
program and through the United Nations efforts to remove the mines
and resettle the refugees and help reconstruct the war-torn economy.
   ``So we would call upon the Soviet Union to refrain from other
forms of interference in Afghan affairs,'' Bush said. ``The Soviet
Union has nothing to fear from the establishment of an independent
nonaligned Afghanistan and they do bear a certain special
responsibility for healing the wounds of this war.''
   He said he hoped Moscow ``would generously support international
efforts to rebuild Afghanistan.''
   There are widespread fears that a struggle for control by
competing guerrilla groups could throw Afghanistan into a civil war.
   ``The time for recrimination is over,'' he said. ``The time for
bloodbaths is over and I would like to see the various factions get
together and come up with recommendations that would lead to a
peaceful Afghanistan with no more bloodbaths.''

   President Bush said today that Americans ``have
to be wary'' of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's promise to
provide fair and free elections in exchange for the breakup of the
Contra rebel fighting force.
   However, Bush said he did see ``some positive elements'' in an
agreement worked out by Ortega and the leaders of four other Central
American nations.
   Noting that the Central American leaders gave themselves 90 days
to work out the details of the peace pact, Bush said the United
States has time to analyze the situation and make strategy decisions.
   The president hailed elements of the agreement that committed the
Sandinista government to instituting freedom of worship, freedom of
speech and fair elections. But he said there are ``some troublesome
elements.''
   ``What's troubling me is that ... claims like this have been made
at one time, only to see those claims repudiated. Promises made and
promises broken,'' Bush said. ``So I think we have to be wary. ...
Let's be sure that we not leave the resistance standing alone, leave
them twisting down there without fulfillment of the methods of
democracy on the part of the Sandinistas.''
   The president commented in an Oval Office interview with a small
group of reporters,
   Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, had voiced skepticism
about the peace plan earlier.
   Fitzwater joined State Department officials in noting that U.S.
officials will soon be discussing the situation with the leaders of
Central American democracies.
   Asked whether the administration would seek a renewal of
humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, which expires
March 31, the spokesman said only that ``no decisions have been made
at this point.''
   He acknowledged, however, that the decision on whether such aid
should continue would ultimately rest with Congress. He did say that
``there certainly is a fundamental continuing commitment to the
Contras.''
   Meanwhile, the revised peace plan signed by five Central American
leaders is producing signs of a new conservative-liberal split in
Congress over what to do about the Contras.
   The two key elements of the agreement, reached Tuesday after a
two-day summit in San Salvador, El Salvador, call for early
demobilization of the Contra rebels and fair national elections in
Nicaragua no later than February 1990.
   The State Department said Wednesday it is withholding comment on
the plan until it consults with the Central American countries other
than Nicaragua: Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
   But two key members of Congress who have long been on opposite
sides of the Contra debate offered sharply differing assessments
Wednesday of the communique, which calls for a Contra demobilization
plan to be formulated within 90 days.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., a Contra backer, argued against the
sequence outlined in the agreement, saying the elections in
Nicaragua should be held before the Contras disband.
   ``If they lay down their arms (now) there won't be elections,''
said Edwards, who has been a Republican floor leader during previous
Contra aid debates.
   He said it was important to keep the Contras ``together and armed
until there is democracy.''
   But Rep. David Bonier, D-Mich., the chief deputy majority whip,
expressed hope that the Bush administration will look favorably upon
the plan.
   Alluding to the Sandinista promise of free elections and other
liberalizing measures, Bonier said, `` I think this is what the
Contra forces in essence have been asking. I think it presents a
unique opportunity for them to take advantage of it.''
   Bonier said U.S. and West European economic and political
pressure has proved effective in inducing the Sandinistas to
undertake democratic reforms but ``every time we have applied
military pressure, there has been a constricting of freedoms.''
   Edwards and Bonier were interviewed on PBS's McNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, meanwhile, questioned whether there
was an ``enforcement mechanism'' which would ensure that the
Sandinistas make a good faith effort to carry out their democratic
promises.
   If Ortega reneges, Quayle said in a radio interview, ``we're
going to have to regroup and come up with a new strategy to move
Nicaragua in the direction of pluralism.''
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero appeared to have mixed feelings about
the agreement, alternately praising and condemning it while talking
with reporters in El Salvador.
   The noncommittal stance of State Department spokesman Charles
Redman was attributable, in part, to a number of unanswered
questions about the meaning of the communique and the motives of the
four presidents friendly to the United States in signing it, U.S.
officials said.
   One official, insisting on anonymity, said the communique appears
to mean that ``we are two steps closer to the final killing of the
Contras.''
   About 11,000 rebels are clustered in camps on the Honduran side
of the border with Nicaragua, where they are sustained by the U.S.
humanitarian aid program.
   Congressional critics of the Contras are likely to insist, as
their price for additional 's ``infamous book'' has had ``appalling consequences
in some
Islamic countries.''
   ``It is a decree, it is a verdict after careful consideration,''
he said of the death sentence. ``It has nothing to do with any
particular country.''
   On Wednesday, protesters stoned the British Embassy in Tehran.
   Britain reopened the embassy in December after an eight-year
closure, and intended to appoint an ambassador and have more than 12
diplomats, the Foreign Office said.
   In New Delhi, an anonymous caller to the United News of India
threatened to bomb British flights unless Rushdie emerged from
hiding.
   At London's Heathrow Airport, British Airways immediately
tightened security with bag-by-bag searches of luggage of passengers
on its Thursday evening flights to the Indian sub-continent and the
Far East.
   Air Europe, another British-owned airline with flights to India,
said it was taking the threat seriously.
   Amid a growing international furor, the Pakistan government
called in the British and American ambassadors and demanded that all
copies of the book be destroyed.
   Pakistan, India and several other countries banned the book.
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto reached agreement with her right-wing
opposition in January on a parliamentary resolution upholding the
ban.
   Tehran Radio said religious figures in the northwestern Iran city
of Urumiyeh said in a statement, ``We have already put on our death
shrouds and pledge to carry out the Imam's (Khomeini's) death
sentence against Salman Rushdie and his publishers in the United
States and Europe.''
   The broadcast followed reports that other death squads were
headed to Britain from Islamic countries in search of Rushdie, a
41-year-old Moslem.
   Rushdie dropped out of sight soon after Khomeini announced the
death sentence on Tuesday on him and Viking, his publishers in
Britain and the United States.
   The $2.6 million bounty offered by Iran was matched by Mohammad
Hashemian, religious leader in the southwestern city of Kerman, who
offered the cash reward ``to any group or individual who carries out
the death sentence on Rushdie and his publishers.'' That brought the
total bounty to $5.6 million.
   Non-Iranians would be paid $1 million if they got to Rushdie
first.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
the United States was ``appalled by the death threats against Salman
Rushdie by the Ayatollah Khomeini, as well as a subsequent offer of
a reward for his murder.''
   ``Such threats are completely irresponsible and are incompatible
with basic standards of international conduct,'' he said, adding
that he did not see how ``this in any way could improve the
prospects'' for U.S.-Iranian relations.
   In the Netherlands, where he is on a NATO tour, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III called the death threats ``regrettable.''
   Sheik Mohammed Hossam-el-Din, a leading Islamic theologian in
Cairo, said Khomeini erred in sending death squads after Rushdie
because executing him would be ``virtually impossible'' under the
tenets of Islam.
   Hossam-el-Din said in an interview that nobody has been executed
in Islam's 1,350-year history as an apostate, which he interpreted
as the crime that Khomeini invoked in issuing his sentence against
Rushdie. Khomeini said only that the Indian-born author deserved to
die for insulting Islam.
   In other developments:
   _ The French government said it was ``shocked'' at the death
threat and Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek canceled a trip
to Tehran.
   _ Italian publishers Arnoldo Mondadori Editore Spa said they
would go head with a contract to release the Italian edition of
``The Satanic Verses,'' but Rushdie's French publishers, Christian
Bourgois, suspended publication plans.
   _ The British Arts Council, backing earlier protests by British
writers, denounced the threats against Rushdie and his publishers as
contrary to the ``tolerance and understanding that are the hallmark
of a free society.''

<HEAD>Politicians Split on New Dialogue with Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of a new dialogue between liberal
Israelis and Palestinians said Thursday it could lead to
negotiations with the PLO, but some right-wing opponents view those
involved as traitors.
   The controversy has created new tensions in the uneasy governing
coalition of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's conservative Likud bloc
and the more dovish Labor Party.
   Two private meetings were held this week by three prominent
Palestinans who support the Palestine Liberation Organization and
leading Labor Party members close to Finance Minister Shimon Peres,
the party leader.
   Liberal parliament members and other Israelis opposed to the
government policy of refusing to talk with the PLO also have flown
to Europe to participate in academic forums, debates and conferences
with PLO officials.
   At least four conferences are scheduled in the coming weeks. Such
forums skirt an Israeli law making contact with the PLO punishable
by up to three years in jail.
   Peres hinted that he may join the informal discussions later
despite opposition within his party.
   Avraham Burg, a Labor dove who attended one of the meetings,
would not reveal what was discussed but said one aim of the dialogue
was to ``create an awareness'' that Israel could not ignore the
Palestinians.
   ``We both suffered from an on-going process of demonization of
the enemy,'' he said. ``I want the Israelis to realize that
something is going on, and ... that we have no excuse any more to
say there is nobody to talk to.''
   Galia Golan, a Hebrew University professor who attended a
conference with PLO officials in the Netherlands last week, found it
``very encouraging'' and said: ``They have come to the conclusion
they must negotiate, and must limit their demands. They've come a
long way.''
   Faisal Husseini, a Palestinian who heads the Arab Studies Center
in Jerusalem and is close to Yasser Arafat, said he joined the talks
to explain PLO positions so they would seem less threatening to
Israelis.
   ``It is time to go and talk to these people, and let them see the
monster face to face, and see he is not a monster,'' he said
Tuesday, adding that he wants the meetings to involve other than
leftist Israelis.
   ``Palestinians are accepting the idea of meeting with Israelis
more close to the center,'' he said.
   Husseini, 48, is the scion of a prominent Jerusalem family. His
father was a military commander and his grandfather mayor of the
city.
   Also involved in the talks with Israeli politicials were Ziad Abu
Ziad, a journalist, and philosphy professor Sari Nusseibah.
   Right-wing members of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, attacked
the dialogue with Palestinians and Eliezer Waldman of the Tehiya
party said Israeli participants should be tried for ``working with
the enemies of Israel.''
   Yossi Ahimeir, spokesman for the prime minister, said: ``We don't
consider these meetings as important. On the contrary, it will not
come to anything.''
   Of the Israelis involved, he said: ``These people are not in
charge of making policy for the state.''
   Some contacts with Palestinian supporters of the PLO have been
made by defense officials and senior army officers as part of an
initiative by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a Labor Party hawk.
   Rabin raised the possibility Thursday of negotiating for an
undefined ``political entity'' with elected Palestinians from Jordan
and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where an uprising began
more than 14 months ago.
   He promised ``really free elections ... to choose political
representation to conduct negotiations with us on a political
process that would not immediately reach a permanent solution. We
can't resolve that problem at once.''
   Speaking on Israel's Arabic television program, Rabin indicated
flexibility about withdrawing the army from voting areas on election
days and providing guarantees that no one would interefere with
voting. He promised to force a Cabinet vote if Palestinians accepted
his proposal, even with reservations.
   Many Palestinians suspect, however, that Israel is trying to
create an unacceptable local alternative to Arafat's leadership.
   ``The Israelis, in their rejection of talking to the PLO, are
trying to find someone else to talk to,'' said Haidar Abdul Shafi,
head of the Red Crescent Society in the Gaza Strip. ``They are
trying to dismember the Palestinians in the territories from those
outside.''
   Rabin's intitiative appears to have been the genesis of the
unofficial talks between Husseini and Labor Party doves. Husseini
met with Defense Ministry official Shmuel Goren while still in jail
last month.
   Husseini had been in jail without trial during most of the
Palestinian uprising, suspected of involvement in underground
activities.

<HEAD>Doctor Who Posed For Norman Rockwell Retires After Half-Century of
Practice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small-town doctor who made house
calls for more than a half-century and was a model for one of the
best-loved works of illustrator Norman Rockwell retired on his 83rd
birthday Thursday.
   Donald E. Campbell said he knew it was time to quit because he
had begun forgetting people's names. He made his last house call
Wednesday, his last day of work.
   ``There's nothing more disgusting than when your memory starts to
go,'' he said. ``Makes you feel like a horse's `patootie.'''
   Campbell was the only doctor in this picturesque western
Massachusetts community, Rockwell's hometown. He said he has
arranged for a few physicians in neighboring communities to take
over his patient load.
   The doctor did his own laboratory work and developed his own
X-rays between examinations in his cluttered office on West Main
Street. On Thursday the telephone in the office rang off the hook
with patients begging him to stay on.
   He practiced obstetrics, pediatrics, gynecology, dermatology,
orthopedics and gerontology, and worked even after supper on most
days, seeing 13 patients on Monday.
   Campbell was medical examiner until this week, but planned to
keep on the town board of health. He also planned, he said, to
devote his time to his four daughters and to continue to lend an ear
to patients who stop him on the street in this town of 2,000 people.
His wife, Anna, died last month.
   Rockwell, a patient of Campbell's until his death a decade ago,
used the doctor as a model for several illustrations, including
``Before the Shot,'' in which a physician prepares a shot for a
bare-bottomed youngster as the boy suspiciously examines his framed
medical degrees.
   Campbell said he owned the original but reluctantly sold it for
$10,000 several years ago to raise money for the financially
troubled Edgecomb Nursing &amp; Convalescent Home, which he had founded
in 1968. Rockwell sold it for him to a New York state doctor whom
Campbell declined to identify.
   A charcoal sketch of the painting was on display at the Norman
Rockwell Museum down the street from the doctor until last month.
The whereabouts of the original is unknown, the museum said.
Campbell said the only memento he has of the artist he described as
``shy, genial, happy and a non-complainer'' was a head study
Rockwell once made of him.
   Campbell said he charged $2 for an office visit and $3 for a home
visit when he hung out his shingle in 1939 after graduating from
Middlesex Medical School, now Brandeis University. He often took his
fee in vegetables, venison or cord wood.
   It was no way to get rich, he acknowledged, ``unless you mean
rich in spirit.''

<TEXT>
   By the year 2020, the world's Moslem population
could double, to 1.9 billion, and its share of humanity jump from 18
percent to 25 percent, two population experts said Thursday.
   Of all the world's religions, they said, Islam is the fastest
growing.
   Writers John R. Weeks, who directs the International Population
Center at San Diego State University in California, and Saad
Gadalla, its technical director, said that about 42 babies are born
to every 1,000 people in Moslem countries each year.
   That compares with fewer than 34 in other Third World countries
and only 13 in the western industrial world.
   The study, ``The Demography of Islamic Nations,'' was distributed
in Washington by the Population Reference Bureau, a private group.
   Weeks said in a telephone interview that the Moslem growth is due
first of all to low incomes, which he said were largely a result of
decades of colonial rule in the Islamic world.
   ``When the economic situation goes up, the fertility rate goes
down,'' he said. ``When the status of women goes up, fertility goes
down too.''
   The study pointed to Islamic countries, particularly Tunisia,
where both the economy and the status of women have improved in
recent years. It also noted the disadvantages of women in Moslem
countries, including the prevalence of teen-age marriages and low
levels of education.
   The authors estimated that 980 million of the world's 5.2 billion
people are Moslems. By 2020, they estimated, Moslems will total 1.9
billion people out of roughly 8.6 billion people.
   Indonesia has the world's largest Moslem population, 156,136,000,
the authors said. Of all Moslem nations, they said, Indonesia has
likely made the greatest headway in slowing its population growth.
   ``The immediate explanation for the drop in fertility was the
rapid increase in contraceptive use among married couples of
reproductive age,'' the study said.
   Pakistan has the second largest Moslem population, 104,243,000;
followed by Bangladesh, 93,050,000, and India with 89,034,000.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as of
Feb. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.7 million head, down
2 percent from a year ago but 5 percent more than inventories of two
years ago, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.71 million head, up 3 percent from a year
ago but 8 percent more than two years ago. Officials said it was the
largest January feedlot placement since 1974.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in January totaled 1.67 million
head, down 5 percent from a year ago and down 7 percent from two
years ago.
   As of Feb. 1, feedlot inventories were smaller than a year
earlier in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska and Texas. But California,
Iowa and Kansas showed increases. The seven states produce about
three-fourths of the nation's beef.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as
of Feb. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year
earlier.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said Thursday that Iranian death threats against author Salman
Rushdie were ``regrettable.''
   In Washington, the State Department said it was appalled by the
threats of the Iranian government, which says Rushdie's novel ``The
Satanic Verses'' is a blasphemy against Islam.
   While Baker posed for photographs in Luxembourg with Foreign
Minister Jacques Poos, he was asked about the multimillion-dollar
reward offered Wednesday in Iran for the murder of Rushdie, whose
novel has sparked violent protest from Islamic fundamentalists.
   ``I think that is regrettable,'' Baker said. ``The United States
is fundamentally committed to oppose terrorism in all its forms,
particularly state-sponsored terrorism.''
   Baker's predecessor, George Shultz, was identified with a tough
stand on terrorism.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said,
``We are appalled by the death threats against Salman Rushdie by the
(Iranian leader) Ayatollah Khomeini, as well as a subsequent offer
of a reward for his murder.'' ``Such threats are completely
irresponsible and are incompatible with basic standards of
international conduct,'' he added.
   Redman said he did not see how ``this in any way could improve
the prospects'' for U.S.-Iranian relations.
   Baker made his comments as he held talks with leaders of the
Benelux countries and met with Manfred Woerner, the
secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as he
neared the end of an eight-day trip to 15 allied capitals.
   Baker began the day in Brussels, meeting Belgian Prime Minister
Wilfried Martens and Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans. He met Woerner
at NATO headquarters.
   In Luxembourg, he was received by Grand Duke Jean and Prime
Minister Jacques Santer along with Poos. In the Netherlands, he had
talks with Foreign Minister Hans Van den Broek before a scheduled
flight back to Brussels.
   Baker's trip ends Friday after a stop in France.

   Multiparty elections will be held in spring
1990, official radio said Thursday, about five months after a
military coup ended 26 years of one-party rule.
   Military leader Gen. Saw Maung used his forces to suppress
nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations in September, saying Burma
was heading toward anarchy. But he then promised fair, multiparty
elections.
   The 26-year one-party rule by the Burma Socialist Program Party
ended when Saw Maung, the armed forces chief, took power in a coup
on Sept. 18.
   Thursday night's announcement by the Election Commission over
state radio did not give an exact election date.
   But it said an election law would be published on March 1, ``14
months before the actual elections,'' suggesting a date around early
May 1990. It said the election campaign would begin three months
before the general elections.
   The mention of a three-month campaign was seen as an indication
that the existing ban on public assembly would be lifted and the
parties would be allowed to use state radio and television.
   Registration of political parties began last Sept. 29 and is to
close on Feb. 28. So far, 188 parties have registered with the
commission.

   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, whose
plane burned on the tarmac of a remote island in December, was
delayed leaving a U.S.-run naval base Thursday when three of his
aircraft had engine trouble.
   Ramos and his party boarded a Fokker aircraft at Subic Bay naval
base for a flight to another installation when the pilot discovered
a faulty starter engine and circuit breaker, the Philippines News
Agency said.
   Ramos and the others waited about 90 minutes until a Philippine
navy BO-5 helicopter was flown to the base, 50 miles west of Manila.
   The helicopter arrived at Subic and Ramos boarded. When the pilot
revved up the engines, however, the helicopter also developed engine
trouble and the takeoff was scrubbed.
   Officials then telephoned Villamor Air Base in Pasay City to
dispatch a third aircraft _ a Fokker _ to retrieve Ramos, the news
agency said.
   Minutes later, that Fokker also developed engine trouble and had
to return to Villamor. Finally, a UH-1 helicopter was sent to Subic
and managed to take off with Ramos aboard, the agency said.
   On Dec. 19, a Fokker carrying Ramos and 17 others caught fire
moments after landing at Catarman on Samar island. All passengers
escaped without injury but the plane was totally destroyed.
   One of several helicopters sent to Catarman to fetch Ramos' party
developed engine trouble and ditched in the sea. No one was killed.

<TEXT>
   A man linked to the military was
convicted of assassinating an Amnesty International official, and he
was sentenced to life in prison, a judge said Thursday.
   Allan Climaco was found guilty Wednesday of ``murder with
aggravating circumstances'' after witnesses identified him as the
triggerman in the June 24, 1988, slaying of lawyer Alfonso Surigao.
   Surigao was an official of the Philippine branch of Amnesty
International, the international human rights group. He was also
chairman of the Protestant Lawyers' League, an association of human
rights lawyers who have frequently defended alleged communist rebels.
   The attorney was one of five human rights lawyers slain in the
Philippines last year. Human rights groups say the killings were
engineered by the military, which is trying to put down a 20-year
communist insurgency.
   In a telephone interview, Judge Juanito Bernad said the evidence
against Climaco ``was overwhelming and very strong.'' He said seven
witnesses identified Climaco as the gunman who killed Surigao at his
home in Cebu City, 350 miles southeast of Manila.
   Climaco later surrendered and issued a written confession,
claiming he acted on instructions of Maj. Rico Palcuto, the regional
military security chief. Climaco said he was a former guerrilla of
the communist New People's Army and had turned into a military
informant.
   Three months later, Climaco retracted his statements and pleaded
innocent before the court.
   Palculto was court-martialed last year but later reinstated.

<HEAD>Stanford Denies Responsibility For Migrants Living On University
Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A short walk from Stanford University's
golf course, impoverished migrant farm workers living on university
land are crammed into wretched wooden shacks without heat, toilets
or running water.
   ``There are more illegalities, more exploitation of workers, more
breaches of workers' rights in this one plot of ground right here
than we've seen in a long, long time,'' said Jim Eggleston, attorney
for a university union that the migrants want to represent them.
   But who is legally responsible for the migrants' plight?
   Is it the university, which owns the land? Or is it Webb Ranch,
which has leased 300 acres and pays the migrants for picking berries
and vegetables that sell to restaurants and markets 30 miles north
in San Francisco?
   The migrants have asked the United Stanford Workers, the union
for 1,200 university maintenance workers, to represent them. The
union sent a letter this week to Stanford President Donald Kennedy
and Webb Ranch demanding recognition as the bargaining agent for the
farm workers.
   If Kennedy and Webb don't recognize the union by Friday, the
union plans to file a petition with the state Agriculture Labor
Relations Board that could lead to a vote by the farm workers on
union representation.
   Eggleston contends Stanford, as land owner, is the true employer
of the farm workers under state law and is ``legally responsible for
the shameful activity that's going on here.''
   Stanford attorney Priscilla Wheeler disagreed.
   ``Stanford is not responsible for the employment policies of its
lessees or contractors,'' she said in a statement. ``We would, of
course, be concerned if any lessee violated the law. So far as we
know, Webb Ranch has not done so. If there are issues of
mistreatment, we hope they are brought up with the state.''
   Stanley Webb, manager of the ranch leased by his family since
1922, was not available for comment Thursday, his office said. Other
ranch officials would not comment.
   The migrants' shacks are just a half-mile from the center of what
is considered one of the most beautiful college campuses in the
nation. Tuition and room and board next school year will total
$19,164.
   Up to 90 migrants, including 20 children, live in the encampment.
Among them are Tibuecio Cabrera, 67, and his wife, Cointa Mendoza,
58.
   Cabrera's last monthly pay receipt shows he worked 194 hours and
earned $824.50, or $4.25 an hour. He took home $514.86 after
deductions for Social Security, unemployment tax, a $50 personal
advance, rent of $145.50 and utilities.
   ``I sometimes get angry, but I have to comfort myself,'' Cabrera
said. ``What else can I do?''
   Cabrera and his wife have a small electric heater and some
blankets to keep warm. They have a hot plate, but there is no sink
or water in the room. Clothing hangs from a cord and a bare bulb
dangles from a wire tacked to the wall near several pictures of
Jesus and the pope.
   Like the other workers, Cabrera receives no health care, no
holidays and no vacation. He said he had to use all his savings to
pay for treatment of a stomach ailment.
   The camp has only one portable toilet and three indoor toilets.
There is a communal kitchen and refrigerators are padlocked between
meals.
   Only a few of the migrants speak or read English.
   Webb charges 75 cents for every hour worked for rent, so the more
hours worked the higher the rent. The migrants are charged for the
tools they use.
   The migrants, long afraid to speak out because they were illegal
aliens from Mexico, asked the Stanford union to represent them after
receiving protection under the federal amnesty program for
agricultural workers, Eggleston said Wednesday.
   Other labor groups also are supporting the migrants.
   ``I think this is a step backward in history,'' said Art Pulaski
of the San Mateo County Central Labor Council. ``It's somewhat
reminiscent of the company towns, where the employers control people
not only at work but at home after work ... Stanford University is
acting like a Third World employer here.''

Blackout</HEAD>

   Air traffic controllers warned a British
Airways pilot he was on a collision course with another airliner,
allowing a hasty turn that averted a possible in-flight crash,
authorities said.
   ``There is an investigation. We did have two aircraft that
violated the parameters established for separation,'' Fred O'Donnell
of the Federal Aviation Administration confirmed Thursday.
   The British Airways and American Airlines jetliners came within
15 seconds of colliding Monday night over Westminster after one of
the jets was rerouted because a power blackout briefly closed Orange
County John Wayne Airport, the Orange County Register reported.
   Controllers at the Los Angeles Terminal Radar Facility said the
planes, flying at 9,000 feet, came within 1{ miles horizontally and
200 feet vertically of each other, the paper said. O'Donnell said he
was couldn't divulge the distances separating the planes.
   FAA regulations require that planes be kept at least three miles
apart horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically.
   An unidentified controller at the Los Angeles facility spotted
the potential collision and warned the British Airways jet.
   John Wayne Airport was closed to commercial traffic for about
four hours Monday night because a short-circuit shut down the main
runway lights.
   The American jet, scheduled to land at the airport 40 miles
southwest of Los Angeles, was diverted to Ontario International
Airport because of the blackout, said Jim Brown, an American
spokesman in Dallas.
   American Flight 1262 from San Jose had 66 people on board and was
being guided by controllers at the FAA's radar center at El Toro,
airline and FAA officials said.
   The British Airways Boeing 747, which can carry as many as 376
people, was departing Los Angeles International Airport for London.
It was being guided by Los Angeles controllers.

<HEAD>Official Newspaper Prints Red Cross Report on Katyn Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities for the first time allowed an
official newspaper to publish evidence that implicates the Soviet
Union in the massacre of thousands of Polish officers during World
War II.
   The bodies of more than 4,000 Polish army officers deported to
the Soviet Union were uncovered by Hitler's army in the spring of
1943. Official Soviet and Polish histories have long maintained the
officers were murdered by the Nazis in 1941, but many Poles and
Western historians blame the Soviets.
   The Katyn massacre, named for the Katyn Forest where the bodies
were found, is one of the most sensitive issues in Polish-Soviet
relations. For many Poles, it symbolizes a list of historical
grievances against the Soviet Union.
   A confidential report made by the Polish Red Cross in June 1943
that appeared Wednesday in the weekly Odrodzenie (Rebirth) said:
``Judging by the papers found with the corpses, the murder took
place in the months of March and April 1940.''
   Because the site, 12 miles west of Smolensk in western Russia,
was at that time in possession of the Soviets, the report implied
Soviet responsibility for the crime.
   In an introduction to the Red Cross document in Ordrodzenie,
historian Jarema Maciszewski wrote, ``As it is known, determining
the date of the Katyn murder is at the same time equal to pointing
at the perpetrators.''
   The Polish officers were deported by the Soviets to camps in the
western part of the Soviet Union after the Red Army invaded Poland
in September 1939. Hitler's army invaded the Soviet Union in June
1941.
   Each of the officers, primarily reservists representing the cream
of the Polish intelligentsia, was executed with a bullet to the base
of the skull.
   The report published Wednesday was written by Kazimierz
Skarzynski, general secretary of the Polish Red Cross during the
war, and it was found in British archives, Maciszewski wrote.
   For propaganda reasons, the German occupiers of Poland had
permitted a Polish Red Cross team to make a five-week study of the
graves. Secreted among the team were representatives of the Polish
underground, according to historian Jan Zawodny.
   The conclusions of the investigation have long been known in the
West, but the Odrodzenie article said this was the first time the
report has been published in Poland.
   Maciszewski is chairman of the Polish side of an official
Soviet-Polish commission appointed in 1987 to investigate the Katyn
massacre and blank spots in history, including the 1920 war between
Poland and the Soviet Union and the murder of most of the top
members of the Polish Communist Party on Josef Stalin's orders in
the late 1930s.
   The commission has yet to publish its conclusions, and Polish
officials have said the Soviet side is responsible for the delay.
   The government Tuesday said that the stand of the Polish
historians on the panel may soon be made public separately from
those of the Soviet side.
   Many Poles had hoped Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would
mention the Katyn massacre during a six-day visit to Poland last
July. While Gorbachev spoke of painful episodes between the two
countries in a speech to the Polish Parliament, he made no specific
mention of Katyn.

   The European Parliament on Thursday
called for a strict ban on mining in Antarctica and denounced a
proposal to divide the continent's mineral resources among
industrial countries.
   Parliamentarians from the 12-nation European Economic Community
also condemned the Wellington Convention and urged member states not
to ratify it.
   The convention, if ratified, would divide the continent's mineral
resources among the industrial nations.
   The Parliament said if Antarctica's oil and mineral resources are
exploited, it ``could have disastrous effects on its ecosystem and
consequently on the well-being of mankind.''
   The European body said the Antarctic should be set aside as a
nature preserve where all wild animals would be protected and the
natural state would remain intact.

   Martha C. Shields told her son and daughter when
they were growing up to stay away from the old brown trunk in the
basement. When she died this week, they found the skeletal remains
of an infant inside.
   State medical examiners Thursday set about determining the age,
sex and cause of death of the infant, who may have been dead 30
years. There is no evidence so far to suggest that any crime was
committed, police said.
   ``Investigators at the scene, assisted by the state crime
laboratory and the medical examiner's office, speculate that the
baby was a full-term baby, and was probably a couple of weeks old,''
said state police spokesman Sgt. Joseph Ireton.
   Mrs. Shields, a 67-year-old widow, died of natural causes Monday
in her home in suburban Elkridge. The skeleton was found in a
steamer trunk Wednesday afternoon by Mrs. Shields' grown daughter
and son, who were going through the woman's effects searching for a
will, said Trooper Mike Davey.
   ``It was a brown steamer trunk, pushed against the wall in the
basement,'' Davey said. ``It had things piled on it and things piled
around it.'' The skeleton was found wrapped in two blankets, he
said, and an old Bible and remnants of a white dress also were found.
   Joyce Shields, 31, and her brother, Robert, 29, told
investigators that when they were young, their mother told them
never to go near the trunk, Davey said.
   But not long before she died, she told them to take care of what
was in the trunk, the officer said, adding, ``It was their
interpretation that it was the will that was in the trunk.''
   Mrs. Shields' children, who declined to comment publicly, told
investigators there had been no family discussion about a child who
died at birth or shortly afterward, Davey said. Nor did they recall
their mother ever being pregnant while they were growing up.
   A search of the home by state police failed to turn up anything
to explain the infant's remains, he said, and a check of state
records found no mention of any child born to Mrs. Shields from 1950
on, other than Joyce and Robert.
   The family had lived in the house in Elkridge for about 20 years.
Before that they lived in Baltimore, Davey said. ``As near as they
(the two children) can recall, when they moved, the trunk went with
them,'' he said.

   Theme restaurants that sprinkle sawdust on the
floor for a dash of Wild West authenticity won the first round
Thursday in a shootout with the state health department, which calls
the practice unsanitary.
   ``This is regulation gone wild,'' said Rep. Stan Barnes as he
voted for a bill overturning the Department of Health Services
sawdust ban.
   Restaurants with names like the Big Apple and the Satisfied Frog
are pushing a bill to overturn the department and allow sawdust as
long as it is changed daily and sprinkled with a non-toxic fire
retardant. The House Environment Committee approved the measure
Thursday in an 8-4 vote and sent it to the health committee.
   The feud began in earnest a year ago when state and county health
departments cracked the whip on an estimated 25 to 40 restaurants in
the state that sprinkled sawdust on the floor.
   The Bill Johnson's Big Apple chain has used sawdust since 1956
and has served 30 million customers, said Don Kalfas, general
manager of the chain and president of the State Restaurant
Association.
   ``If there were a health hazard, direct or indirect, with
customers during those years and with those numbers, we'd have heard
some feedback,'' he told committee members.
   One of those voting against overturning the ban, Rep. Herb
Guenther, said he enjoyed dining at the Big Apple but ``I don't see
why this issue should be before this body. I'm just not prepared to
usurp the authority given DHS on minor issues.''
   Dr. Steven Englender, who heads the health department's division
of disease prevention services, said sawdust in a dining area is
kicked up by foot traffic and settles on silverware, food and
kitchen tables.
   California and Pennsylvania are the only other states to allows
sawdust, he said, adding that county and local health departments in
Arizona agree that sawdust ``may harbor insects and vermin.''
   As for the requirement that sawdust be changed daily, Englender
said, with inspections averaging two times a year, ``enforcement
obviously would be difficult; compliance would be next to
impossible.''

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has delayed until
mid-March a decision on letting a major U.S. defense contractor work
with Japan to develop and produce a new version of the F-16 fighter,
congressional sources said Thursday.
   Plans to transfer to Japan $7 billion in advanced American
aircraft technology have generated opposition on Capitol Hill to the
deal involving the proposed FSX fighter, which Japan wants to
upgrade its air capabilities by the late 1990s.
   Under the pending agreement, St. Louis-based General Dynamics
would join forces with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to
co-develop and co-produce the fighter.
   A congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that after considerable jockeying among agencies, the Defense
Department and Commerce Department were asked to study the
strategic, commercial and technological aspects of the project and
do a combined report by March 10.
   The review was ordered at a National Security Council meeting
Tuesday night that had been called on less than 24 hours notice,
according to the source.
   The State Department and the Pentagon, which had taken the lead
in negotiating the FSX agreement, contended that a final decision
should be made this month. The Commerce Department, however, had
sought a delay of 60 to 90 days.
   Other agencies, including the U.S. Trade Representative and the
Labor and Treasury departments, also had been leaning toward
Commerce's position in favor of a thorough review.
   During a White House press briefing Thursday, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said only that with regard to the FSX,
``the interagency process is still under way. I would not expect it
to come up in Japan.''
   President Bush will go to Japan next week to attend the funeral
of Emperor Hirohito.
   Proponents of the FSX deal say it is the best that could be
negotiated _ in view of Japanese refusal to buy wholly
American-built planes _ and it fosters beneficial technology
transfer in both directions with Japan while generating income and
jobs for U.S. industry.
   But critics contend the agreement amounts to a technological
giveaway that will enable the Japanese to compete more effectively
against this country in the global aviation market. They argue that
Tokyo should purchase American-made fighters to help offset the $50
billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   On Capitol Hill, a group of 21 senators last week introduced a
resolution declaring they have ``strong reservations'' about the
deal and urging a 60-day delay to allow time for a thorough review.
   General Dynamics, this country's No. 2 defense contractor, has
said that under the deal, it and other U.S. companies will receive
35 percent to 45 percent of the $1.2 billion being spent on
development of the FSX as well as a comparable share of the $5
billion production program.

   President Bush called budget negotiations a
``two-way street'' on Thursday and denied he was trying to shift to
Congress the responsibility for proposing unpopular cuts.
   ``I don't think that is the informed opinion of the key leaders
in Congress today,'' Bush said.
   He also denied any major policy rift with Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan over interest rates, though he added,
``maybe we'll get into a fight down the road.''
   In an interview with a small group of reporters, Bush said he was
pleased so far with congressional reaction to his $1.16 trillion
spending plan for fiscal year 1990.
   ``I said ahead of time I didn't expect everybody would jump up
and down and say this is the greatest thing since sliced bread,''
Bush said.
   ``The Republicans have generally been enthusiatic,'' he said.
``The Democrats, though not endorsing it quite as much, have seen
some positive direction, some positive objectives, in the budget.''
   Some Democratic critics have complained that the Bush budget,
while advocating expanded social programs, is vague on details of
what must be cut to pay for the new initiatives.
   These critics have said the situation allows Bush to get credit
for new programs to aid education, the homeless and environmental
cleanup, while sticking Congress with the job of finding cuts in
other areas to pay for them.
   After saying that wasn't the view of key leaders, Bush added that
if some people do hold that opinion, ``then we will redouble our
efforts to be sure they understand there's no validity to that.''
   ``Yes, there's a lot more detail that has to be hammered out. And
we will work with them to satisfy their interests, and find out what
they want. It's a two way street,'' he said.
   Bush also said he was pleased with the reaction so far to his
plan to rescue the nation's ailing savings and loans, even though he
said that few are thoroughly enamored with it.
   As for interest rates, Greenspan's Federal Reserve has neen
nudging up short-term rates in recent months in an effort to
minimize inflation risks. Greenspan has indicated he would rather
err on the side of tighter credit than encourage a rekindling of
inflation.
   But Bush said Thursday: ``I don't see the inflationary pressures
as so bad, or enough, to warrant substantially higher interest
rates. I don't see that.''
   Still, he said he and Greenspan ``aren't far apart'' and asserted
that politicians, bankers and business journalists delight in trying
to ``drive a wedge between the president and the charman of the
Fed,'' regardless of who is in power.
   ``I want to avoid that. ... You know, maybe we'll get into a
fight down the road but I don't think it's at hand.''
   Bush said the ``best thing to do about interest rates is to get a
budget agreement.'' He said a budget plan such as the one he
unveiled last week would _ if adopted _ help to drive down rates.
   The Bush administration has projected that short-term rates _ now
at over 8 percent _ will ease to around 7 percent this year and fall
to 5.5 percent by 1990. Many private economists have labeled these
projections too optimistic.
   ``The interest rates will be lower if we can promptly get a
budget agreement,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Security Council Authorizes Independence Plan, Peacekeepers</HEAD>

   The Security Council gave unanimous
approval Thursday to an independence plan designed to free Namibia
from 74 years of South African rule, and it dispatched the first
U.N. peacekeepers to the region.
   A warm round of applause and handshaking after the vote was a
departure from the usual decorum of the council chamber.
   ``This decision sets in motion the process of transition of
Namibia toward independence through free and fair elections under
the supervision and control of the United Nations,'' said Ambassador
Jai Pratap Rana of Nepal, council president for February.
   ``The decision also marks the last major step toward
decolonization. We look forward to welcoming Namibia as a fellow
member of this family of nations before long.''
   April 1 was set as the date to begin the one-year plan for
Namibia's transition to a nation ruled by its black majority. The
resolution adopted by the 15-member council implements an
independence plan for the territory, also known as South-West
Africa, that has been ready since 1978.
   Approved along with the resolution was a recent report by
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on implementation that
calls for sending 4,650 U.N. peacekeepers, 500 police supervisors
and at least 1,000 civilian election monitors to Namibia.
   Which countries will provide personnel for the peacekeeping force
has not yet been decided, but China has offered to send up to 20
election monitors as its first participation in such an effort, an
Asian diplomat said.
   The Namibian independence mission will be called the U.N.
Transition Assistance Group, or UNTAG.
   Martti Ahtisaari, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's
special representative for Namibia, said Steven Fanning, head of the
UNTAG's police unit, was expected in Namibia on Friday for talks
with Gen. Dolf Gouws, the territorial police commissioner.
   Namibia's police will continue to be responsible for civil order,
supervised by the U.N. police.
   Gen. Dewan Prem Chand, the UNTAG military commander, is to arrive
early next week with civilian civilian administrators, Ahtisaari
added.
   Perez de Cuellar has estimated UNTAG will cost $416 million in
its first year. That would make it the most expensive U.N.
peacekeeping mission since the Belgian Congo operation of 1960-64,
which cost more than $400 million and involved 19,828 soldiers at
its peak.
   Also Thursday, the General Assembly approved funds for a 70-man
team of U.N. military observers to monitor the withdrawal of 50,000
Cuban troops from neighboring Angola as Namibia becomes independent.
   That group, the U.N. Angola Verification Mission, was budgeted at
$9.2 million for this year and $19.4 million over the 31 months of
the Cuban withdrawal.
   Dante Caputo, the Argentine foreign minister and assembly
president, said the General Assembly probably would meet next week
to approve funds for UNTAG.
   South Africa captured South-West Africa from Germany in 1915,
during World War I, and was given a League of Nations mandate in
1920. The General Assembly abrogated the mandate in 1966 but South
Africa had refused to leave.
   The stage was set in December when South Africa, Cuba and Angola
signed accords at U.N. headquarters pledging them to a peace plan
for southwest Africa combining Namibian independence with the Cuban
withdrawal from Angola.
   Cuban troops have helped Angola's Marxist government defend
against U.S.-backed rebels and incursions by South African troops
pursuing guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization.
   Under the peace accords, half the 50,000 Cuban soldiers will have
withdrawn by Nov. 1, when Namibia is scheduled to hold elections for
a constituent assembly. Independence is envisaged in April 1990.

<TEXT>
   Sporadic exchanges of artillery and
machine-gun fire Thursday threatened to undermine a cease-fire that
halted 22 hours of fighting between the army and Christian
militiamen for control of the Christian heartland.
   Police said 66 people were killed and 200 wounded in the
fighting, which pitted the divided army's Christian units against
the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia in the nearly
14-year-old civil war against the Moslems.
   The army command and the Lebanese Forces said in separate
announcements that an agreement was reached for both sides to pull
back at all confrontation points ``to facilitate movement of people
and civilian traffic.''
   But neither side said whether the withdrawals actually took place.
   Fighters on both sides took advantage of the cease-fire starting
Wednesday evening to fortify front-line positions northeast of the
capital's Christian sector with sandbags and earthmounds, raising
fears that a new round of hostilities was imminent.
   Police said regular troops and Lebanese Forces militiamen dueled
intermittently with howitzers and machine guns in Beirut's Christian
Ein Rummaneh district and the northern suburbs of Tabarja, Adma and
Antelias.
   The thud of exploding shells echoed across the capital, which has
been split into Moslem and Christian sectors since the outbreak of
the civil war in 1975.
   A military source said army commander Gen. Michel Aoun accepted
the cease-fire on condition that the Lebanese Forces pull out from
east Beirut streets and from government facilities they control.
   The fighting has irrevocably shattered the unity of the Christian
camp. It has involved mostly Maronite Catholics, the 850,000-strong
group that has dominated power since Lebanon's independence from
France in 1943.
   Also Thursday, a U.S. Embassy official denied Christian radio
reports that Ambassador John McCarthy has decided to evacuate the
embassy's estimated 20 American staffers to Cyprus.
   ``There are no plans for us to leave,'' the official said on
condition of anonymity.
   He said a couple of shells crashed about 200 yards from the U.S.
Embassy compound in the Aukur suburb of east Beirut, but that none
of the American employees was hurt.
   Window glass of the compound housing the diplomatic and consular
missions was totally shattered, and both sections remained closed
for the second straight day, he said.
   The police spokesman said Aoun's 20,000 troops have captured all
militia positions in Lebanon's central mountain range but failed to
block militia supply lines.
   Aoun's troops now control about 75 percent of the Christian
enclave covering 310 square miles north and northeast of Beirut, the
spokesman said.
   But Lebanese Forces militiamen led by Samir Geagea still control
the main urban centers along the enclave's 25-mile Mediterranean
coastline, he added. The enclave is home for 1 million Christians.
   Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, has been staying at his command headquarters in Yarze,
east of Beirut, since the fighting broke out.
   The 53-year old general, who seeks to become Lebanon's next
president, was named head of a caretaker military cabinet by
outgoing President Amin Gemayel Sept. 22 after parliament failed to
elect his successor.
   In another development, an American woman was shot in the head
and killed while driving her car in north Lebanon, one of her
friends said.
   Gail Pascoe Harfoush, 38, a native of Washington, D.C., was
killed Wednesday afternoon as she drove her Mercedes-Benz from
Tripoli to the village of Burj Akkar, 25 miles away, said her
friend, Marilyn Rashka.
   Ms. Rashka, an American who lives in Beirut, said she heard about
Mrs. Harfoush's death from friends whom she declined to identify.
She said Mrs. Harfoush was shot twice in the head and neck, and that
the motive for the killing was unknown.

   Some moose are spending lots of
time on the town these days.
   With the Thief River frozen over, the animals use it as a highway
to steal into this northwestern Minnesota town where they wander
down residential streets, dine on hedges and apple trees and often
get their pictures taken.
   ``Everybody seems to enjoy them, other than they like to get them
out of their yards,'' said police Officer Tim Miller.
   Usually, they go back home to the woods after police herd them to
the edge of town by slowly driving alongside, maybe yelling, honking
or sounding the siren.
   But these days, three persistent moose just aren't taking hints,
so officers have taken to firing exploding shells to frighten them.
   ``We chase them out and they just come back,'' said Miller, who
has chased off the cow and her calves three times in a week.
   One reason the moose come to town, observers say, is that it's a
lot easier to move around than in the woods, where the snow these
days is moose-belly-deep.

   This Hollywood is none too happy with
efforts by Tinseltown on the Pacific Coast to take control of the
city name.
   City commissioners in Florida saw stars _ not the movie variety _
when they learned the name could become the exclusive property of
Hollywood, Calif.
   It seems the Chamber of Commerce of Hollywood, Calif. _ actually
a district of Los Angeles _ filed last month for a trademark on the
name.
   ``We don't believe we should have to get their permission to use
our own city's name,'' Mayor Mara Giulianti said. ``We are a duly
incorporated city, and they aren't even a city.''
   If granted, the trademark would apply throughout the United
States for any commercial use of the name Hollywood, although an
exception would be made for the area within the city limits of
Hollywood, Fla.
   That's not good enough, City Manager Irv Rosenbaum said.
   ``We market tourism nationally,'' he said. ``We're the eighth
largest city in the state. We should be able to use our name
wherever.''
   At least seven other Hollywoods _ in Alabama, Louisiana,
Maryland, Missouri, New Mexico, South Carolina and West Virginia _
would face the same problem, Giulianti said.
   In 1987, the same Chamber of Commerce lost a battle for exclusive
rights to the name when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office decided
the name did not belong exclusively to Hollywood, Calif.
   The California group changed its application to allow Hollywood,
Fla., to use the name commercially within the city's limits. But the
Californians want control over the name for the rest of the country.
   Hollywood, Fla., plans to fight the trademark application.

<HEAD>Bush Would Like Humanitarian Aid to Contras to Continue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Thursday he wants rebel
forces in Nicaragua to continue receiving humanitarian aid and
declared ``we have to be wary'' about promises by leftist President
Daniel Ortega to hold fair elections.
   In his first comments on an agreement by five Central American
countries to disarm the Nicaraguan guerrillas, Bush acknowledged the
United States had been caught off guard by the pact, signed Tuesday,
and said, ``There are some positive elements to it and there are
some troublesome elements to it.''
   Bush, on another foreign policy matter, said he hoped that
Afghanistan, with the departure of Soviet troops, could fashion ``a
stable, broadly based government'' without bloodshed among competing
guerrilla groups.
   ``The time for bloodbaths is over and I would like to see the
various factions get together and come up with recommendations that
would lead to a peaceful Afghanistan with no more bloodbaths,'' Bush
said.
   He refused to endorse a Soviet proposal for an immediate
cease-fire in Afghanistan and an embargo on arms shipments to the
country, expressing concern that Moscow may have stockpiled weapons
there for the Marxist government.
   ``It would not be fair to have a tremendous amount of lethal
supplies left behind and then cut off support for the resistance and
thus leave an unacceptable imbalance,'' Bush said.
   He made his remarks in a wide-ranging question-and-answer session
with eight reporters who were invited into the Oval Office. Sitting
in a wing chair in front of a slow-burning fire, Bush also made
these points:
   _He would ``strongly oppose'' any attempt to outlaw all
semi-automatic weapons if that would mean outlawing all pistols and
rifles that could be fired continuously by repeatedly pulling the
trigger. The weapons are popular among drug gangs and one was used
in the massacre of five children in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard
last month.
   A lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, the nation's
biggest gun lobby, Bush said, ``I'm not about to suggest that a
semi-automated hunting rifle be banned.''
   _He considers budget negotiations a ``two-way street'' with
Congress and said he was not trying to shift to lawmakers the
responsibility for proposing unpopular cuts. Bush said he was
pleased so far with congressional reaction to his $1.16 trillion
spending plan for fiscal 1990.
   _He wants to avoid a dispute with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan over interest rates ``because we aren't far apart.'' The
Fed has nudged up short-term interest rates in recent months as a
precaution against inflation. Bush said he did not think
inflationary pressures in the economy warrant substantially higher
interest rates.
   _He is concerned about the slow pace of personnel appointments
for his administration but said ``I don't think it's hurting the
government.'' He blamed delays on tougher rules governing the
disclosure of assets.
   _He said he hopes his campaign for high ethical standards in
government has not ``created something that just carries things too
far.''
   He expressed sympathy for Louis Sullivan, his nominee as
secretary of health and human services, who gave up accumulated
sabbatical pay to join the government. Bush also said Secretary of
State James A. Baker III had ``made the right decision'' to sell
stocks in a New York bank holding company that holds third-world
loans.
   _Bush said ``we are far closer to West Germany than public
perceptions might be'' after Chancellor Helmut Kohl said a decision
could be put off until 1991 on modernizing battlefield nuclear
weapons in Europe. The United States and Britain are urging NATO to
support the modernization.
   The president said he wanted to ``shoot down the concept that
there are major divisions'' between Washington and Bonn and added,
``I'm not worried about NATO unity. You always worry that you have
your act totally together . ...''
   Discussing the Central American plan to close down Nicaraguan
rebel bases in Honduras in return for open elections in Nicaragua,
Bush said he was pleased by Ortega's talk of freedom of the press,
freedom of elections and freedom of worship.
   He said Ortega's regime has a history of ``promises made,
promises broken.
   ``And so I think we have to be wary,'' Bush said. ``Let's be sure
that we not leave the resistance standing alone, leave them twisting
out there without fulfillment of the commitment to democracy on the
part of the Sandinistas.''
   U.S. humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan rebels expires March 31.
Asked if his comments suggested he would seek more money for the
guerrillas, Bush said, ``It could mean that. It could mean that.''
   Bush said, ``I don't think anybody would want to suggest that we
would leave people with no humaniarian aid. I can't imagine anyone
taking that view.''
   Asked directly if he would ask Congress for more aid, Bush said
he had some time before making that decision but added, ``I have
every intention of seeing that these people receive humanitarian
support, but how that comes about, we'll just have to wait and see.''

   A moderate guerrilla faction on
Thursday ended its boycott and rejoined a fragile coalition of rebel
groups trying to form a new government in Afghanistan.
   Rebel soldiers, meanwhile, continued to attack cities held by
government troops. Rockets fired into two cities killed at least 12
people, radio and Afghan Foreign Ministry reports said.
   The attacks came one day after the last Soviet troops pulled out
of the country, ending a nine-year intervention.
   Also Thursday, Radio Kabul said 600 troops from Pakistan, which
supports the guerrillas, marched on an Afghan city on Feb. 10.
   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Thursday he was considering Afghanistan's request for U.N.
border outposts to check the flow of U.S. and Pakistani arms to
Afghan rebels.
   But he declined to say whether the U.S. supply of arms to the
rebels violates the April 14 agreement signed in Geneva that
resulted in the Soviet troop withdrawal.
   Some Western officials have predicted that the Afghan army will
be unable to prevent Kabul and other major Afghan cities from being
taken by Moslem guerrilla forces now that the Soviet forces are gone.
   Leaders of Afghan guerrilla factions based in neighboring
Pakistan and Iran are meeting here to try and reach a consensus on
forming a new government that will encompass their disparate views.
   The Pakistan-based Afghan National Liberation Front rebel group
returned to the council Thursday after a two-day boycott because
``we cannot do much by remaining outside,'' said group spokesman
Zabihullah Mojaddidi.
   On Wednesday, guerrilla leaders put a plan for a provisional
government before the 400-member council. Mojaddidi said the
proposal is incomplete and ``we don't believe it should be discussed
at this stage.''
   The National Liberation Front boycotted the shura after its
proposal for allowing Afghans living in Iran to take part in the new
government was rejected by the other leaders of the seven-member
guerrilla alliance based in Pakistan.
   The role of the Iran-based rebels has been turned over to a
special commission.
   Mohammad Karim Khalili, spokesman for eight Iran-based guerrilla
parties, said Thursday his group will not accept the decisions of
the commission because it isn't a part of it.
   Most of the rebels based in Pakistan are Sunni Moslems and most
of the Afghans based in Iran are Shiite Moslems. The majority of
Afghanistan's 15 million people are Sunni Moslems.
   In Kabul, six civilians, including three children, were killed
when rockets blasted residential areas of Kabul, an Afghan Foreign
Ministry spokesman said.
   Mohammad Badakhshi, who lost his 11-year-old daughter in the
attack, asked, ``Who is doing this?''
   ``I've lost my daughter, and now I'm losing my mind,'' he told
reporters.
   Ghazni city, about 105 miles south of Kabul, also was hit by
rockets that killed six, reported Radio Kabul.
   The state-controlled radio blamed criminial extremists,
presumably referring to anti-communsit rebels.
   Radio Kabul also charged Pakistani troops were sent into Ghazni
to ``carry out terrorist activities.'' Ghazni is about 90 miles west
of the Pakistan border.
   Some of the 600 Pakistani soldiers were deployed to the garrison
town of Urgun in eastern Paktika province, the radio broadcast
claimed.
   The Pakistan government has denied crossing into Afghanistan to
support the rebels.
   Radio Kabul said 34 guerrillas were killed in fighting Wednesday
and Thursday.
   In New York on Thursday, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said
his government asked the United Nations to set up outposts along the
Afghan-Pakistan border to halt the flow of arms to guerrillas.
   Perez de Cuellar was noncommittal.``I am considering this,'' he
said.
   The United Nations has about 50 observers in Afghanistan and
Pakistan to monitor compliance with the U.N.-mediated agreement.
   The U.N. chief also was asked whether U.S. aid to the rebels was
a violation of the pact. ``This is a subject which I intend to
discuss with American authorities when I meet them,'' he said,
referring to his trip to Washington on Friday.

<HEAD>Makers of Containers Widely Used by Fast-Food Industry Stop Using
CFCs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Makers of foam plastic containers widely used
by fast-food restaurants have stopped using CFCs which contribute to
destruction of the world's ozone layer, a trade group said Thursday.
   It said makers of the food and beverage containers no longer use
fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, as an expanding
agent during the manufacturing process.
   When CFCs reach the stratosphere, they break down the ozone layer
that protects the Earth from ultraviolet rays. Increased exposure to
this solar radiation is known to cause skin cancer.
   An international agreement has called for cutting the production
of CFCs by 50 percent by the end of the century and some of the
leading manufacturers have said they intend to phase out production
of CFCs entirely, although no timetable has been set.
   CFCs are most widely used in refrigeration and air-conditionining
systems. Their use as an expanding agent in manufacturing food and
beverage containers always has been small, accounting for less than
3 percent of all CFCs produced.
   But David Dull, whose office at the Environmental Protection
Agency monitors CFC use, said elimination of CFCs from food service
containers is significant because it represents the first time an
entire industry has stopped using the chemicl.
   ``What we're applauding ... is a process, the beginning of a
process,'' Dull said at a news conference held by the Polystyrene
Packaging Council and the Foodservice &amp; Packaging Institute.
   He said the phaseout of CFCs in the making of polystyrene food
containers ``is proof that American industry can develop
inexpensive, technological alternatives to CFCs.''
   Recently, the Polyurethane Foam Association also announced plans
to phase out the use of CFCs in making foam cushioning, he said.
   Joseph Bow, president of the Foodservice &amp; Packaging Institute,
said the makers of the fast-food containers have replaced CFCs in
the production of polystyrene with another chemical that poses a
significantly lesser threat to the ozone layer because it breaks up
at a much lower altitude.
   ``We realize this (replacement) product too has some ozone
depleting potential,'' he said, adding that the industry is
searching for another agent that poses no such threat at all.

   Lufthansa German Airlines has signed a contract
to purchase as many as 30 commerical aircraft from Airbus Industrie
in a deal estimated to be worth as much as $3 billion, Airbus
officials announced Thursday.
   Lufthansa has agreed to purchase 15 Airbus A340 aircraft, which
are to be delivered between September 1992 and March 1994. Lufthansa
will receive both A4340-200s, which seat 222 passengers, and the
larger A340-300s, which have 256-seat cabins.
   According to the contract, signed Wednesday, Lufthansa will
decide later on whether to purchase the additional 15 aircraft.
   Airbus officials said Lufthansa will use the A340s to replace its
fleet of DC10-30 aircraft. The new jets will enable Lufthansa to
offer more non-stop, long-range routes from Germany to the United
States, South America and the Far East, according to Airbus
officials.
   With th Lufthansa order, Airbus now has firm orders, options and
commitments for 110 A340 aircraft.
   Lufthansa's order gives another boost to the commercial jet
industry, which is already enjoying a successful year.
   Earlier this month, American Airlines signed a 142-plane deal
with McDonnell Douglas Corp. The contract was estimated to be worth
as much as $7 billion.
   Last year, $48.5 billion dollars worth of new planes were
ordered, the highest total ever.
   The Lufthansa purchase plan continues a trend predicted by
industry officials, who estimate that the demand to replace aging
aircraft could push annual aircraft sales to $450 billion in 1989
dollars by the year 2005.

   The Supreme Court lifted its stay delaying the
start of Oliver North's trial Thursday, but North's lawyers
complained he cannot get a fair trial under a deal struck by his
prosecutor and the attorney general for handling testimony involving
national secrets.
   ``Defendant North still faces two governments, rather than a
single prosecutor with full power to make all trial decisions,''
said Brendan Sullivan, the head of North's defense team, in papers
filed with U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.
   The Supreme Court, meanwhile, lifted a stay that had been
requested by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh while he was still
arguing with independent counsel Lawrence Walsh over whether rules
on disclosing classified information were tight enough.
   There was no word from Gesell when he would summon jurors, who
are already selected, to his court to begin the trial of the former
Marine lieutenant colonel and White House aide. However, a meeting
was scheduled in Gesell's courtroom Friday, meaning the jury would
not be empaneled until Tuesday at the earliest _ after the
Washington's Birthday holiday observance.
   The newest Thornburgh-Walsh arrangement ``would impose
intolerable burdens on the court, the witnesses, and the jurors,''
Sullivan said. He asked Gesell to tell the attorney general he can
take action to dismiss the entire case or any of the 12 criminal
charges but that he will not ``have the right or the opportunity to
intervene in the trial.''
   Sullivan recalled that Gesell had said earlier in the week that
Thornburgh would have no right to intervene ``by bits and pieces''
to object to the introduction of classified material. But Sullivan
said the new arrangement does give Thornburgh that ability.
   Under the arrangement announced Wednesday, Walsh agreed to ask
Thornburgh for an affidavit whenever Walsh believed undisclosable
secrets were about to be spilled in the trial. The attorney general
would stay out of the courtroom while the independent counsel
carried the battle.
   ``Under the independent counsel's proposed plan,'' said Sullivan,
the attorney general will have the right to step in ``whenever the
going gets tough, precisely what the court has forbidden him from
doing.''
   In response, Walsh said North's lawyer is under a misconception
of how the prosecutorial plan will work.
   ``The day-to-day conduct of this case will be by the independent
counsel and only the independent counsel,'' he said. He likened his
relationship with the Justice Department to that of a lawyer who
checks with his client ``to find out whether some supervening policy
requires a termination of the litigation.''
   Sullivan said the new arrangement would guarantee frequent
interruptions, as challenges are made and resolved.
   ``This procedure will recur constantly during the trial _
possibly even question-by-question for a critical witness,'' he
said. ``Defendant North cannot receive a fair trial if the attorney
general is permitted to intervene in the trial through bits and
pieces of affidavit as the independent counsel's plan contemplates.''
   Gesell and lawyers in the case held a closed hearing, lasting
more than two hours, to discuss what the jury can be told about
secret Reagan administration efforts to get help from other
countries for the Contras fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government.
   Lawyers would not say what happened at the hearing, only that the
same subject matter will be discussed at another closed session
Friday morning. They said Gesell had not issued any orders and shook
their heads when asked when opening arguments might be held.
   Sullivan says the ``quid pro quo'' arrangements _ literally,
something-for-something _ are at the heart of the case. The
government is willing to make limited disclosures about the matter,
but North's lawyers want to explore the schemes in greater detail at
his trial.
   In nearly three weeks, the North trial has not progressed beyond
picking a jury of nine women and three men. The jurors, who have not
yet been sworn, have been excused while a high-stakes legal drama
over national security matters has been played out in Gesell's
courtroom, the U.S. Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.
   North is accused of shredding evidence and lying to Congress to
cover up the Reagan administration's attempts to help the rebels
during a period in which Congress had banned direct U.S. aid.
   He faces 12 criminal charges.

<TEXT>
   Richard Roud, who guided the New York Film
Festival to world prominence, died in this southern French city
after a heart attack, a hospital spokesman said Thursday. He was 59.
   Roud, who suffered from heart disease, was admitted to Gaston
Doumergue Hospital on Jan. 15 after suffering cardiac arrest and
remained in a coma until his death on Monday, said a hospital
spokesman who declined to give his name.
   Born in Boston, Roud in the 1950s became London correspondent for
the film journal Cahiers du Cinema. He was film critic for The
Manchester Guardian from 1963 to 1969 and then was a roving arts
correspondent for the paper until his death.
   In 1959, he became program director of the London Film Festival.
Four years later, Roud and his partner, Amos Vogel, were invited by
Lincoln Center to establish a similar festival in New York.
   Vogel resigned in 1969, but Roud remained. He was program
director of the festival from its inception, and became festival
director in 1970. The festival became a popular success that drew
sellout crowds annually.
   At his death, Roud was director emeritus of the festival. He was
ousted from his position in October 1987 in a dispute with the
society's president and executive director. His removal caused some
controversy and resulted in some resignations from the festival
programming committee.
   Roud published four books on cinema and had just completed a
biography of director Francois Truffaut.
   Roud is survived by his sister, Edith Smolens, of Melrose, Mass.

   The Justice Department is planning to set up a
tent-city detention center where it will hold Central American
refugees while their applications for political asylum are
processed, congressional officials said Thursday.
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said in a statement the tent city on
isolated brushland 15 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border would meet
basic human necessities _ adequate housing, food and sanitary
conditions.
   But Duke Austin, a spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said no course of action has been ``set in
stone'' and the issue is still under review by INS and Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh, who has already said detention is an option.
   Justice Department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the idea of a tent city is one option under consideration. But
one source indicated it may not be the preferred option saying:
``nobody wants tent cities.''
   More than 2,000 refugees a week are entering the United States
from Central America and most of them do so by crossing the Rio
Grande River near Brownsville, Texas, officials say.
   The plans call for keeping the refugees in tents near the Port
Isabel Service Processing Center where INS is processing their
asylum applications, the congressional officials said.
   But Smith and two congressional aides, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the tents would have plywood floors and food would
be provided by contractors. No fences would surround the tents, they
said.
   One congressional aide said the Justice Department policy will
begin after U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela is expected to
reinstate an INS policy that bars asylum-seekers from traveling
beyond the Rio Grande Valley while their applications are pending.
   Vela is supposed to rule in the case Tuesday and Austin said the
INS would discuss its plans for handling the refugees at the court
hearing, but not before.
   Before Vela blocked the INS' no-travel policy Jan. 9, Central
Americans who had crossed the Rio Grande illegally were forced to
live in shanty town conditions _ camped out beneath plastic sheets
in open fields _ or condemned buildings.
   INS officials contend many people seeking asylum are here only to
better themselves economically and use the asylum process and
lengthy appeals to get into the United States. Political asylum is
granted only to those fleeing persecution for political or other
reasons.

<HEAD>Baker Says Time Not Right for Israeli-Arab Negotiations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told West
European leaders Thursday the time is not right to push for
negotiations between Israel and the Arabs, a senior U.S. official
said.
   Baker promised, however, to have American diplomats pursue
prospects with the PLO, Israel and Arab states and report the
results in three weeks, the official said.
   ``One has to till the ground carefully; one has to proceed
cautiously and understand that if you push the level of discussion
too high, too soon, and create too much international attention you
might preempt opportunities,'' Baker was quoted as telling the Dutch
foreign minster, Hans van den Broek, at The Hague.
   The U.S. official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity,
said van den Broek gave Baker a brief account of findings by the
French, Greek and Spanish foreign ministers, whom the 12-nation
European Economic Community appointed to explore Middle East peace
prospects.
   They visited Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Syria earlier this month
and also met with PLO representatives. The U.S. official said they
found areas of potential progress and also obstacles, but he
provided no details.
   Baker's cautious response indicated the Bush administration was
not eager to plunge into the Middle Eastern thicket despite its
contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   His assurance that the PLO would be sounded out also seemed to
rule out a suspension of the 3-month-old dialogue despite U.S.
irritation over a clash between Palestinian guerrillas and Israeli
forces in southern Lebanon.
   Five guerrillas were slain in what Israel said was an attempted
infiltration of Israel and an act of terrorism. The United States
opened talks with the PLO in December only after its leader, Yasser
Arafat, made a public statement renouncing terrorism.
   The U.S. official said Baker would report results of the U.S.
soundings on the Middle East at the opening of arms control
negotiations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in Vienna on March 7.
All the Western foreign ministers are expected to attend.
   Baker also met with Manfred Woerner, secretary-general of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as he neared the end of an
eight-day trip to 15 allied countries.
   He is exploring their views on foreign policy and defense before
President Bush decides how to deal with Soviet arms reduction
proposals that have raised hopes of disarmament by West Europeans
and unsettled their leaders.
   U.S. officials said Baker was finding an ``ironic'' situation:
that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposals were largely
inspired by the United States but the West European public was
giving the Soviet leader much of the credit.
   Although Baker gave four news conferences on the first four days
of the trip, he has kept reporters at a distance since and sid
little.
   The secretary of state began the day in Brussels, meeting with
Prime Minister Wilfried Martens and Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans
of Belgium and then with Woerner at NATO headquarters.
   He visited Luxembourg and the Netherlands during the day and
returned to Brussels. Baker will fly back to Washington on Friday
after a visit to France.

   Four candidates to succeed William Bradford
Reynolds as the Justice Department's civil rights chief would change
his controversial policies, according to one of those being
considered for the job.
   ``Everyone on the list would turn it around,'' said one of the
candidates, who knows the others and spoke on condition he not be
identified.
   Without discussing specific issues, President Bush has said he
wants to depart from the Reagan administration's civil rights
policies, which included frontal attacks on existing affirmative
action hiring quotas and school busing programs.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh also signaled a shift in
policies by meeting with civil rights leaders, including Jesse
Jackson.
   A top candidate for the job is Evan Kemp Jr., a disabled-rights
advocate who once called for Reynolds' resignation during a battle
over proposed changes in regulations prohibiting discrimination
against the handicapped, according to administration sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Kemp, who uses a wheelchair, is a member of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. He is considered the White House's choice to
become assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice
Department's civil rights division, the sources said.
   Kemp said in an interview this week that White House counsel C.
Boyden Gray told him he was a top candidate for the job and his
meeting Tuesday with Thornburgh did not dispel that impression.
   Also under consideration are Daniel Rinzel, minority chief
counsel for the Senate's permanent investigations subcommittee;
Martin Gerry, former head of the Office of Civil Rights in the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare and James P. Turner, a
career Justice Department official, said the sources.
   Jackson, emerging from his meeting last month with Thornburgh,
praised the attorney general's commitment to civil rights and told
reporters that ``the lights have been turned back on in the Justice
Department.''
   David Runkel, an aide to the attorney general, said ``we're
looking for someone whose views reflect Thornburgh's and the
president's views on the importance of the civil rights division.''
   ``We're looking for somebody who can work with civil rights
organizations,'' Runkel said, noting Thornburgh's interest in the
issue dating back to the 1960s.
   Reynolds clashed repeatedly with civil rights groups, who accused
him of trying to undercut the force of federal laws and court
decisions affecting minority rights.
   Reynolds helped formulate and direct the Reagan administration's
challenges to minority hiring quotas. He also spearheaded the
efforts to overturn court-ordered busing and restrict guarantees of
the rights of women and the mentally ill.
   Without directly criticizing Reynolds, Kemp said the Republican
Party's failure to attract black voters last fall was due in part to
the Reagan administration's civil rights record.
   ``I think it's very important for the Republican Party to have a
civil rights record they can run on and attract votes from groups
covered by the civil rights laws.''
   While no decision is expected for at least another week, Kemp
``is certainly a leading candidate,'' said one administation source.
   The appointment will be made by Bush on Thornburgh's
recommendation and is subject to Senate confirmation.
   Rinzel is a former career Justice Department lawyer who headed
the criminal section of the civil rights division, setting records
for prosecutions. He was promoted to a deputy assistant attorney
general by Reynolds.
   Turner, the acting civil rights chief, was a government civil
rights lawyer in the 1960s when violence flared in such places as
Selma, Ala., and Jackson, Miss. He prosecuted civil rights violators
in the South during this period.
   Gerry has served as counsel to the Wednesday Group of House
moderate Republicans.
   Without commenting on specific individuals, Washington civil
rights lawyer William Taylor said ``at least some of the candidates
who are being considered seem to have some experience and some have
a record of favoring civil rights.''
   ``If one of those candidates is named, it will be a refreshing
change'' from the previous eight years, said Taylor, who heads the
enforcement committee of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.

<HEAD>First Opposition Party Formed in Yugoslavia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first full-fledged opposition
party in Yugoslavia since the Communist takeover after World War II
was established on Thursday, despite a police threat to ban the
party if it stayed independent.
   About 1,000 people jammed into the downtown Cankarjev Dom
convention hall in this Slovenian capital to hear party leader
France Tomsic proclaim the founding of the Socialist Democratic
Union of Slovenia.
   He told the founding convention the party would strive for
parliamentary democracy and free elections and intends to compete
for parliamentary representation with the League of Communists, the
only legal party here since 1946. Prominent intellectuals from
Slovenia were among those attending.
   The party published its program in Wednesday's issue of the
liberal Mladina youth weekly, saying it ``will strive for a peaceful
transition from the country's single-party (Communist) system to a
system based on (Western-style) parliamentary democracy.''
   His audience on Thursday loudly applauded Tomsic's appeal for
Slovenia to seek closer ties with West Europe and its social
democratic parties.
   ``This convention is important because after nearly 50 years an
alternative independent political party is being formed in
Yugoslavia,'' Tomsic said.
   He said earlier in an interview with The Associated Press, ``As a
political organization we will try to fill the vacuum created by the
loss of trust in the Communist Party.''
   At the entrance, party aides distributed party literature and
application forms.
   The party program called for parliamentary democracy, an
independent judiciary, private initiative, independent unions and
legalization of strikes. It said the Slovenian republic and all of
Yugoslavia should ``link up with the West European political,
technological and cultural integration'' process.
   It demanded abolition of military courts.
   Tomsic said Slovenian recruits should be allowed to do their
military service in Slovenia and that Slovene should become an
official language in the army, where only Serbo-Croatian is now
spoken.
   Tomsic told the AP earlier, ``Europe's history has shown that
social democracy had done much more for the people than the
Communists.''
   He said the party would be independent.
   A short time later, Tomsic was summoned to police where he was
told that both the party and the convention would be banned unless
his group joined the Socialist Alliance, a Communist-led mass
organization comprising all social and political groups.
   The convention went on as planned, however.
   Asked if his group would join the umbrella organization, Tomsic
said, ``The statute of the Socialist Alliance of Slovenia is
scheduled to be changed in April and according to the proposed
changes the Communist Party will not retain the leading role in it.
   ``If that happens, we will join the Socialist Alliance.''
   A recent survey conducted by Mladina said that if free elections
were conducted immediately in Slovenia, the Social Democrats would
get 35 percent of the vote and the Communist Party only 9 percent.
   The rest of the votes went to groups now exiting only in the
imagination, such as Christian Democrats, Greens and Liberals.
   Yugoslavia, with a population exceeding 22 million, is a
patchwork of six republics and two autonomous provinces. Josip Broz
Tito led Yugoslavia into the Communist camp in November 1945, but
this country broke from the Soviet orbit in 1948 and has since been
non-aligned.
   Last Jan. 11, the first autonomous political group in Yugoslavia,
the Slovenian Democratic Union, was formed in Ljubljana, but it
agreed to operate within the framework of the Socialist Alliance.
   Prominent intellectuals have called for the introduction of a
multiparty democracy here, saying it would be the only way out of
Yugoslavia's deep economic and political crisis.

   President Bush said Thursday he will ``strongly
oppose'' any attempt to outlaw semiautomatic guns, despite
increasing homicides and the use of such a weapon in a California
rampage that left five children dead.
   His declaration put him at odds with his wife, Barbara, who told
The Associated Press Feb. 3 she is afraid of guns and ``absolutely''
believes that assault-style weapons should be outlawed.
   Spurning pleas for tougher controls, Bush said, ``No, I'm not
about to do that. And I think the answer is the criminal _ do more
with the criminal.''
   Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, the
nation's chief gun lobby, said states ``have a lot of laws on these
things. Let them enforce them. It's hard, very hard to do, but
that's my position and I'm not going to change it.''
   Bush made his comments in an Oval Office interview with eight
reporters.
   He drew a distinction between automatic weapons, which fire
continuously by holding the trigger down, and semiautomatic weapons,
which fire each time the trigger is pulled without cocking.
   Talking about semiautomatics, Bush said, ``If you're suggesting
that every pistol that can do that (fire each time the trigger is
pulled) or every rifle should be banned, I would strongly oppose
that.
   ``I would strongly go after the criminals who use these guns,''
he said. ``But I'm not about to suggest that a semi-automated
hunting rifle be banned. Absolutely not.''
   The president said he learned just earlier in the day that fully
automatic weapons are banned from import into the United States.
   Bush said he was concerned ``enormously'' by the rash of
homicides in the District of Columbia. Thirteen people were killed
or wounded by gunfire in the city on Tuesday, making Valentine's Day
the bloodiest day in Washington in memory.
   ``When you let a guy out of jail to commit a crime like this _
it's outrageous. Two of these people were people that already had,
have ... Help,'' Bush said, turning to his staff for information.
   It was not clear which cases Bush was talking about, although a
gunman who killed three coworkers in suburban Chevy Chase, Md.,
before killing himself had been a patient in a mental hospital for
two years before being released in 1986.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration did not have any plans now for tighter gun controls.
   Dozens of states, as well as Congress, are considering measures
to outlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of a variety of
semiautomatic weapons.
   Los Angeles police chief Daryl F. Gates, an adviser to Bush
during the presidential campaign on drug abuse and crime, has
endorsed legislation to limit the sale and import of assault weapons.
   The Los Angeles City Council has banned the sale of semiautomatic
weapons but has delayed its order for a week in connection with a
suit filed by Colt Industries Inc. challenging the law.
   Before the interview, Bush's position on guns was outlined during
a White House briefing, even as the district's homicide toll reached
75, following a record 372 homicides in 1988.
   ``Everyone in the country, including the president, is outraged
by the homicides whether it be in Washington, D.C., or California or
anywhere else,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``There are any number of appropriate solutions to this kind of
problems, the most obvious is for stepped up law enforcement but I
know that everyone shares those concerns,'' the press spokesman said.
   ``It does pose a major challenge to the law enforcement community
in this country and there are a lot of ways you can come at that but
we don't have any comment on specific episodes,'' Fitzwater added.
   It was a Chinese AK-47 assault rifle that a gunman used in a
rampage last month in Stockton, Calif., in which five children were
killed and 29 others were wounded.
   ``The issue of assault weapons and AK-47s and so forth is an
important one that has emerged in these recent episodes and one that
probably needs to be looked at, in fact is being looked at by any
number of state authorities as well as public interest groups who
are involved in this,'' the White House spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said Bush ``has concerns about these items. We're
simply saying that we don't have any proposals for changing gun
control laws at this point. But on the other hand it is worthwhile
for a consideration of these new weapons and what do they mean for
society and should there be any changes.''

<HEAD>Playwright Thomas Bernhard Dead At 58</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas Bernhard, the controversial writer
and dramatist known as the enfant terrible of Austrian theater and
literature, has died at age 58, police said Thursday.
   The cause of death was officially given as heart failure, a
police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Bernhard was most recently in the headlines over the Vienna
production last fall of his play, ``Heldenplatz,'' which caused a
furor with its outspoken criticism of anti-Semitism, President Kurt
Waldheim and other politicians and institutions in Austria.
   The playwright was found dead in his house in the town of
Gmunden, 80 miles west of Vienna Sunday morning, three days after
his 58th birthday, the police spokesman told The Associated Press.
   He declined to say why it had taken four days to announce the
death, but the Austria Press Agency later reported it was Bernhard's
wish to be buried before his death was announced.
   Bernhard's half-brother, Peter Fabjan, disclosed the playwright's
last wish after a brief funeral today, the news agency said.
   Barnhard had suffered for the past 40 years from a lung condition
that Austrian radio said required regular treatment with cortisone.
   Born on Feb. 9, 1931 in the Netherlands, Bernhard was the
illegitimate child of a Salzburg woman and a peasant father whom he
never knew.
   He grew up in Vienna, the Austrian countryside and southern
Bavaria before being sent in his early teens to a home in Salzburg.
   Leaving school early to become a grocer's apprentice, Bernhard
was hospitalized for months at a time with severe lung complaints
from 1948 to 1951. In 1955, he entered Salzburg's famed Mozarteum to
study acting and music, and in 1957 published his first volume of
poetry.
   Publication of several novels, short stories and more poetry
followed, winning an increasing series of awards for the man whom
prominent West German critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki termed ``the most
melancholy poet and most bitter prophet of German literature.''
   His plays, often directed by the current controversial director
of Vienna's Burgtheater, Claus Peymann, were a continual subject of
controversy in Vienna and Salzburg.
   In 1976, for instance, his play ``The Famous'' opened in Vienna
after being rejected by the Salzburg festival because of its
criticism of prominent Salzburg cultural figures.
   Peymann's production of ``Heldenplatz'' at the Burgtheater last
fall also sparked a raging controversy over whether state money
should be used to subsidize art so critical of Austria.
   Many Vienna critics, however, praised the play and its
performance.

   A conservative Episcopal group on Thursday renewed
efforts to muster resistance to female priests with a full-page
newspaper ad less than a week after the 450-year-old church ordained
its first woman bishop.
   ``Episcopalians! Do Something,'' trumpeted the advertisement in
the Boston Herald, a daily newspaper in the diocese that consecrated
Bishop Barbara C. Harris.
   Sponsors said the ads will run elsewhere in the country this
spring. Boston was ``as logical a place as any to begin,'' said
Canon Brien Koehler of the Fort Worth, Texas-based Evangelical and
Catholic Mission, which is behind the ad campaign.
   Koehler said it is unlikely the Episcopal Church will reverse its
10-year policy of allowing women into the priesthood. He said a
Synod, or council, the mission is organizing to be held this June is
intended to ``find a way to allow ourselves to live and breathe
within the Episcopal Church. Whether the official channels of the
Episcopal Church will tolerate that, I think that's really a great
question right now.''
   The ad asks readers to sign and return to the group a
``declaration of common faith and purpose.''
   Koehler said mission members believe that biblical teachings
portray the church as a family with the man, or husband, as the head.
   ``Those are strong Bible images that we really think can't be
overturned,'' he said. ``It really has nothing to do with equal
rights.''
   It was the latest note of discord since Harris was elected last
September, a position that gave her entry into an apostolic
succession the church traces back to the time of Jesus.
   At Harris' consecration as suffragan, or assistant, bishop, two
men spoke against the ordination, including one who termed it
sacrilege. But the congregation of about 8,000 roared its approval
when asked if it was their will that she be ordained.
   The 58-year-old black Episcopal priest from Philadelphia had been
criticized for being a woman, being divorced, lacking formal
seminary degrees and having served as publisher of the liberal
Episcopal publication ``The Witness.''
   Byron Rushing, an Episcopalian and state representative who is a
friend of Harris', said the advertisement wasn't a surprise.
   ``This organization has been beating up on the Episcopal Church
Publishing Co. and beat up on Barbara when she was executive
director of that company,'' he said.
   Officials of the 96,000-member Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts
said they had no comment on the ad. Spokesman Jim Solheim also said
Harris was aware of the ad and had no comment.
   At a news conference after her election was formally approved by
Episcopal bishops around the country, Harris acknowledged that some
church members would have difficulty with her role, but said she did
not believe a schism would result.
   Diane Spence, director of development at the Episcopal Divinity
School in Cambridge, said she also doubted schism will ensue. She
said the ad was a way for the opponents of ordaining women ``to fly
their flag.''
   ``I think that we're going to find a way to work together and
keep the dialogue going,'' she said.

responsibility for war recovery</HEAD>

   President Bush said Thursday he hopes the final
pullout of Soviet armed forces from Afghanistan ensures ``no more
bloodbaths'' there and said the Kremlin bears a special
responsibility for ``healing the wounds'' of the war.
   While applauding the troop withdrawal as ``a new chapter in the
history of Afghanistan,'' Bush rejected a Kremlin call for an
immediate cease-fire and arms embargo.
   Answering questions from a group of reporters in the Oval Office,
he said he was afraid rebels opposing the Soviet-backed Kabul
government would be left in a disadvantageous position if U.S.
assistance stopped.
   Just hours before Bush talked to reporters, the second-ranking
official at the Soviet Embassy in Washington had reiterated the
Kremlin's call for a cease-fire.
   Minister-Counselor Yevgeny Kutovoy said that a comprehensive
settlement of the strife in Afghanistan depends for the most part on
``a broadly based government with the participation of all warring
parties and without outside interference.''
   Bush demanded the Soviets stay out of Afghan affairs.
   ``The Soviet Union has nothing to fear from the establishment of
an independent, non-aligned Afghanistan,'' he said in a written
statement. ``At the same time, the U.S.S.R. bears a special
responsibility for healing the wounds of this war, and we call upon
it to support generously international efforts to rebuild
Afghanistan.''
   Bush's comments came a day after the final pullout of Red Army
forces from Afghanistan after a nine-year occupation.
   Bush said he could not endorse the cease-fire and arms embargo
proposal because he was concerned Soviet forces may have stockpiled
weapons for the Marxist government in Kabul.
   ``It would not be fair to have a tremendous amount of lethal
supplies left behind and then cut off support for the resistance and
thus leave an uacceptable imbalance,'' he said.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said there has been
massive stockpiling by the Soviets in recent months. Supplies
provided to the Kabul regime include numerous fighter aircraft and
helicopters, dozens of medium tanks, infantry fighting vehicles,
armored personnel carriers, more than 200 howitzers and scores of
other artillery pieces and hundreds of transport vehicles.
   ``In the final days of the withdrawal, they left behind even more
military equipment, including tanks, APCs and multiple rocket
launchers,'' he said.
   Bush said the U.S. commitment to the Afghan people ``will remain
firm, both through our bilateral humanitarian program and through
the United Nations' efforts to remove the mines and resettle the
refugees and help reconstruct the war-torn economy.''
   There are widespread fears that a struggle for control by
competing guerrilla groups could throw Afghanistan into a civil war.
   ``The time for recrimination is over,'' Bush said. ``The time for
bloodbaths is over and I would like to see the various factions get
together and come up with recommendations that would lead to a
peaceful Afghanistan with no more bloodbaths.''
   During the Soviet Embassy news conference, Kutovoy said, ``The
question at stake at the present time is this: either restoration of
peace on the Afghan soil or continuation of senseless bloodshed.''
   ``The issues of humanitarian and economic assistance to
Afghanistan are of ever-growing significance at this crucial
stage,'' he said.
   But the Soviet official also said, ``When certain elements of the
Afghan opposition are trying to intensify pressure on the current
Afghan government, resorting to barbaric methods and to all
different kinds of diversions, to the blockade of Afghan cities,
they are trying to prevent the civilian population from getting food
and consumer goods.''
   ``It is our first belief that all the states should do their best
to preserve Afghanistan as a sovereign, neutral and non-aligned
state,'' he said.

<HEAD>Democratic Report Criticizes Education Department's Civil Rights
Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic aides on a House committee said in a
report Thursday that the Education Department's civil rights office
is beset by mismanagement, confusion and understaffing as a legacy
of the Reagan administration.
   The investigation of Office of Civil Rights enforcement
activities _ by Democratic staff at the Education and Labor
Committee _ concluded that since 1981, the office ``has been stymied
by an administration which actively opposed the laws which were
entrusted to it and took efforts to minimize the agency's potential
impact.''
   The report said the administration had ``severely worsened this
agency's enforcement record'' and said any enforcement that did
occur came from the regional staff ``in spite of OCR's leadership''
in Washington.
   The department's Office of Civil Rights is in charge of enforcing
statutes barring discrimination on the basis of race, gender,
handicap, age and national origin in all federally funded education
activities and programs.
   The current director of the agency, LeGree Daniels, is a holdover
from the Reagan administration. In a letter published with the
report, she denounced it as ``replete with inaccuracies and
misconceptions of OCR's role.''
   She accused the committee staff of misrepresenting her agency's
investigative and enforcement procedures, distorting statistical
evidence and drawing unsubstantiated conclusions. She defended the
agency's emphasis on negotiations, calling them ``an effective,
legally supportable practice'' that has averted the need for
protracted enforcement proceedings in many cases.
   Democratic committee aides visited six of the 10 Office of Civil
Rights regional offices between January and March 1988. Among their
findings, according to the report:
   _The agency initiated 9,768 complaint investigations between
fiscal 1981 and 1988, most of them related to handicap
discrimination. Fifteen percent involved racial discrimination, a
percentage the report said was ``a violation of its mandate'' since
the office was created as a result of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
   _The number of fulltime equivalent employees at the Office of
Civil Rights has dropped from 1,099 in fiscal 1981 to 820 in fiscal
1988. Reagan administration budget requests for the agency declined
from $51 million in 1982 to $41 million in 1989.
   _The Supreme Court's Grove City decision prompted the agency to
close in whole or in part 674 complaint investigations and 88
compliance reviews. The decision said only specific activities or
programs receiving federal money were subject to federal oversight.
   _The administration forced the agency to process state
higher-education desegregation cases under court oversight in 105
days rather than the 195 days recommended by the federal court.
Cases were withdrawn or narrowed to accomplish this.
   _There was ``a clear perception among the regional office staff
that certain issues were `off limits' and could not be investigated.
Most of the issues involved race discrimination.''
   _Letters of findings citing schools for civil rights violations
must be approved by the Washington office. Of 112 draft letters
submitted from January 1987 to June 1988, only seven were approved
while most were resolved with a notation ``violation corrected.''
Little follow-up monitoring was done to assure actual compliance by
school districts and universities.
   The committee staff recommended, among other things, that the
agency conduct more broad compliance reviews of systemic
discrimination issues, particularly on race. The report said the
agency's staff should be restored as quickly as possible to the 1981
level and said the agency should submit staff, computer and
equipment needs to Congress in time for fiscal 1990 budget
consideration.

<HEAD>Pinochet Won't Run In December Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military President Augusto Pinochet said
Thursday he will not run in scheduled December presidential
elections, but he urged government supporters to unite to pick ``one
of ours'' as his successor.
   The constitution bars Pinochet from succeeding himself, but
several pro-government politicians have suggested that a formula be
found to allow him to run, such as a constitutional amendment.
   ``I'm not here as a candidate,'' Gen. Pinochet, 72, said at a
luncheon with supporters in Loncoche, a rural community 370 miles
south of Santiago. ``I cannot be a candidate now.''
   The president's remarks, carried by local radio stations, was his
strongest rejection so far of the possibility he might run in the
election, scheduled for Dec. 14.
   Pinochet, who seized power in a violent 1973 coup, was obliged to
call elections after losing an Oct. 5 referendum in which he sought
voters' approval to remain in power until 1997.
   On the third day of an eight-day tour of southern Chile, Pinochet
urged his supporters to restore their unity, which had been badly
disrupted in the wake of the referendum defeat.
   At least two pro-government politicians have announced their
candidacies to succeed Pinochet. A group of independent businessmen
and politicians are actively promoting the nomination of Pinochet's
finance minister, Hernan Buchi. Buchi, 39, so far has refused to
accept the candidacy.
   ``You must work together for a government of ours,'' Pinochet
told his audience. ``It does not make a difference the person who is
nominated, as long he is one of ours. The candidate must be the one
we all pick. That's our man.''
   The opposition also has stated plans to seek a single candidate.
Leaders of a coalition of 17 opposition parties are scheduled to
meet next month to pick from among at least four contenders to the
nomination.
   Patricio Aylwin, a moderate former Senate president, is
considered the frontrunner. Aylwin is president of the centrist
Christian Democratic Party, the largest in the opposition, and was
the chief spokesman for the opposition during the campaign for the
referendum.
   According to the constitution, Pinochet must hand power to the
winner of the December election on March 11, 1990.

   President Bush will meet next week with Israeli
President Chaim Herzog in Japan at the funeral of Emperor Hirohito,
American and Israeli sources said Thursday.
   Bush is also expected to meet in Tokyo with Jordan's King Hussein
and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, French President Francois
Mitterrand and other world leaders, U.S. officials say.
   The meeting with Herzog is expected to be one of ceremony rather
than substance, since Herzog's role as head of state is largely
cermonial. U.S. officials expect the meetings with the other Mideast
leaders will also be more in the nature of get-acquainted talks than
serious discussions, due to a lack of time.
   Bush will be host to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir at the
White House in April for talks about the future of the Middle East
peace process, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   In preparation for those talks, Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens will meet in the second week of March with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, said the U.S. officials.
   Arens had sought an earlier meeting with Baker while on a
three-day visit to London this week, but was told that Baker's
schedule during his swing through NATO capitals was too hectic to
accommodate him, Israeli sources said, speaking on condition they
not be named.
   The Bush administration has yet to formulate its position toward
future Arab-Israeli peace talks and is still evaluating the latest
developments in the region.
   Among these is the new U.S. opening to the Palestine Liberation
Organization after a 13-year ban on contacts with the group. Bush
and Baker have both expressed caution about the ties to the PLO,
saying it is too soon to tell whether the group is a serious
candidate for peace talks.
   Israel has been urging the new administration to cut off the
talks, saying the group has not changed its anti-Israel agenda
despite a pledge to give up terrorism.
   Both Jordan and Egypt are hoping the new administration will
bring a fresh approach to the 40-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict, but
Baker appears reluctant to rush into the search for a solution which
eluded his predecessor George Shultz.
   U.S. officials say Bush will not make any decisions until after
he meets with the Egyptian, Israeli and Jordanian leaders. Mubarak
is also expected in Washington this spring.

   Biologists trying to protect migrating fish said
Thursday the death of one of two captured sea lions wouldn't deter
efforts to snare more of the fish-eating mammals and return them to
the ocean.
   The 550-pound animal had a week-old bullet wound in its neck and
died after coming out from under anesthesia administered so wildlife
agents could examine him and attach a radio transmitter.
   The wound and an infestation of lung worms ``may have compromised
his ability ... to withstand the anesthesia,'' said Bob DeLong, a
marine mammal biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   ``Using anesthesia on the animal was one of the risks that went
along with studying them,'' he said.
   DeLong said the wounded sea lion may have been shot by someone
frustrated by the animals continued presence at the Ballard Locks
which the migrating fish use from January until spring.
   ``I'm afraid we're going to see more and more shootings,'' DeLong
said.
   About 20 sea lions, which migrate from southern California and
Mexico, have stopped at the locks to feast on salmon and steelhead
trout migrating from the Pacific Ocean through Puget Sound to the
fresh water lakes and rivers of western Washington.
   The other sea lion captured Wednesday was taken 250 miles to the
southwest Washington coast where it was to be released Thursday, as
agents tried to capture more sea lions.
   The wounded sea lion had probably been shot near the locks, which
are in an urban area surrounded by docks and homes, DeLong said.
   DeLong said a .22-caliber bullet wound was found lodged in the
throat of the sea lion, who was sick before he was trapped in the
floating cage agents are using in the removal program, called
``Operation Goodbye.''
   This is the fifth year officials have tried to keep a growing
number of sea lions away from the locks. Protective nets, tape
recordings of killer whales, firecrackers and foul-tasting chemicals
have all proved ineffective.
   DeLong said sea lions are protected from shooting by federal law,
and Congress last year rejected an option to allow managers of the
animals to use lethal methods to control them.
   Ben Deeble of the environmental group Greenpeace, which has
monitored the removal efforts and given tentative approval,
questioned whether it was necessary to anesthetize the animals.
   He said he would support simply transporting the animals and
marking them with paint rather than attaching radio transmitters in
order to determine whether the removed sea lions return to the locks.
   Wildlife officials plan to capture at least a half dozen animals
and haul them to the Long Beach Peninsula, then monitor their
movement.
   Last year, sea lions ate an estimated 1,800 of the wild
steelhead, a sea-going rainbow trout favored by anglers, and only
about 850 of them made it back to their spawning gravel, said Bob
Byrne, spokesman for the state Department of Wildlife.
   This year's run of steelhead was about 1,650 at the fish ladder,
down from about 2,600 last year, officials said last month.

<HEAD>Wright Calls Off Vote on Foreign Ownership Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright on Thursday called off
until after President Bush's trip to Asia a planned floor vote on
legislation that would require disclosure of foreign property
ownership in this country.
   Wright's office said the White House indicated it hoped there
would be no vote on the bill sponsored by Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas,
until after Bush returns from next week's trip to Japan, China and
Korea.
   The House had been set to vote next Thursday on the bill, which
would require foreign owners of American property to provide
information about their holdings to the government.
   The measure began as part of the 1,000-page trade bill that
became law last year but was dropped before that legislation
received the president's signature. The administration and various
business critics said it would stifle vitally needed foreign
investment and hurt business in other ways.
   Bryant and other proponents say Americans deserve to have more
information about foreign ownership of property in the United States.
   Wright's office said the speaker telephoned Bush on Thursday
afternoon from Texas and offered to postpone the vote. ``President
Bush expressed his appreciation,'' the statement said.
   It noted that the bill is similar to a measure passed twice by
the House over the last two years, most recently on Oct. 5, when it
cleared on a 250-170 bipartisan vote.
   House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., on Wednesday was
critical of the plan to vote on the measure next week, saying in a
letter to House Rules Committee Chairman Claude Pepper, D-Fla., the
first floor action on a high-profile bill in 1989 should not occur
without committee consideration.

<HEAD>Pipe Break Forces Shutdown At Plutonium Extraction Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operator of the government's
problem-plagued nuclear weapons complex in South Carolina said
Thursday it had discovered a break in an underground pipe that
carries slightly radioactive waste water to a treatment plant.
   E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. said it temporarily reduced
operations at the Savannah River Plant chemical separation facility
while it replaced a 10-foot section of the pipe and inspected other
underground pipes of similar construction.
   The company said the waste water that leaked from the broken pipe
was high in acid content with ``minute amounts'' of radioactivity
and posed no danger to workers or the environment.
   Joe Odum, chief supervisor with du Pont's environment and energy
department at Savannah River, said in a telephone interview that
workers first detected a problem early this week when a liquid
accumulation was noticed on the surface. The leaking pipe is eight
inches in diameter and is nine feet underground.
   On Wednesday it was determined that a small section of the pipe
had broken off, Odum said, adding that it was too early to estimate
how long it would take to fix the problem.
   The incident is the latest in a series of technical problems that
have arisen at Savannah River, the site of three U.S. Energy
Department nuclear reactors that produce tritium, a radioactive gas
needed to make most nuclear weapons. All three reactors are shut
down because of safety and technical problems.
   Odum said the pipe leak had no direct affect on the
tritium-producing reactors.
   The chemical separation plant at Savannah River separates
plutonium from used fuel rods from the reactors. The plutonium is
then shipped to the Rocky Flats Plant at Golden, Colo., where it is
shaped into triggers to be used on nuclear warheads.
   Once the plutonium is separated from the high-level radioactive
waste in the used fuel ods, the liquid waste is taken to a tank farm
at Savannah River, where some of the waste is evaporated. The
remaining water, containing what du Pont called minute amounts of
radioactivity, is then piped to an effluent treatment plant for
further purification before it is discharged into streams.
   The pipe that developed the leak was installed at Savannah River
during the 1950s and is made of terra cotta, a thick, hard
pottery-like material widely used in sewer lines at that time.

   Police arrested a man who
threatened to blow up police headquarters in Plsen and another who
called the next day saying he would bomb a Prague subway station,
state-run media said Thursday.
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo identified the caller in
Plsen, about 55 miles west of Prague, as Vaclav Sykora and said he
was arrested within three hours after making the telephone threat on
Tuesday.
   It said he was charged with ``spreading alarming reports,'' which
carries a maximum prison term of six months.
   In Prague, police arrested Petr Novohradsky, 38, who confessed
that he threatened on Wednesday to blow up the Museum subway station
on Wenceslas Square, the state news agency CTK said.
   It said he had a record of violence and other criminal offenses.
   Novohradsky's call on Wednesday reportedly led to a 10-minute
subway tieup during rush-hour traffic.
   Novohradsky was charged with spreading alarm, CTK said.
   Rude Pravo said 15 anonymous callers were tracked down in recent
weeks and seven were placed into custody.

<TEXT>
   A Lithuanian political organization that claims
more than 150,000 members agreed to seek an ``independent path'' but
stopped shy of calling for secession from the Soviet Union, one of
its leaders said Thursday.
   The action coincided with the anniversary of Lithuania's original
declaration of independence in 1918. Hundreds of thousands of
Lithuanians turned out for two days of public celebrations, which
were greeted with police dogs and beatings just one year ago.
   The vote late Wednesday night by the national assembly of the
grass-roots group, Sajudis, amounted to the strongest call yet out
of the small Baltic republic for control over its own affairs.
Lithuania has been a part of the Soviet Union since it was annexed
during World War II.
   Small organizations in Lithuania have demanded secession, and
speakers at public rallies have called for removal of the Soviet
``army of occupation.''
   But Sajudis' membership has grown to 150,000-200,000 in a
population of 3.7 million in barely nine months. It is backing
candidates in virtually every electoral district of Lithuania in the
Soviet Union's first multiple-candidate elections for Parliament.
   The vote to strive for an ``independent path'' for Lithuania
passed the Sajudis assembly by a vote of about 204-8, with eight
abstentions, said Alvydas Medalinskas, a spokesman for the group, in
a telephone interview from Vilnius.
   ``It means full political, economic and legal sovereignty,'' he
said. ``But we have many opinions on how to achieve this.''
   The declaration states Sajudis will strive ``to create the
conditions for free and democratic national self-determination,''
according to a text released by a Lithuanian emigre group in New
York. It also said Lithuania should be a neutral state in a European
demilitarized zone.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev rejected any possibility of
Lithuanian secession during a Kremlin meeting with factory workers
Wednesday, but his words were mild.
   ``Those who demand Lithuania secede from the U.S.S.R. are either
people driven by personal or career ambitions, or simply
extremists,'' he told K.M. Ashmonas of the shipyard in Klaipeda,
Lithuania, according to Thursday's newspaper reports.
   ``They do not accept socialism at all, and to expect that they
would protect our value, interests of workers and farmers is
useless. Let us be calm, but let us give them a calm rebuke.
Perestroika has to help us sort out and solve many problems.''
   Lithuanians gathered in cities and towns across the republic for
independence celebrations marked by songs, flowers, a Catholic Mass
at a cathedral and ceremonies at the national cemetery where heroes
of the war of independence are buried.
   A monument to freedom, which had been removed after the Soviet
annexation, was rededicated with a flourish of doves.
   Just one year ago, celebrations of the anniversay ended when
police beat hundreds of demonstrators with rubber truncheons. This
year, the anniversary had government approval.
   Valdas Analauskas, a Lithuanian activist and journalist,
estimated the crowds in Kaunas at 100,000 and in Vilnius at 200,000,
although Medalinskas said celebrants at the Vilnius rally numbered
closer to 80,000.
   The head of the Lithuanian Communist Party even put in a surprise
appearance at the Kaunas rally Thursday morning, Analauskas said in
a telephone interview. Algirdas Brazauskas, the party first
secretary, offered a short speech calling for unity.
   Medalinskas said Sajudis' action was similar to nearby Estonia's
``declaration of sovereignty,'' but noted it was merely the vote of
a grass-roots organization and not a governmental action like the
Estonian constitutional amendments passed in November.
   Estonia's Parliament gave itself the right to overturn Soviet
laws. Moscow promptly declared that unconstitutional but has done
nothing to halt Estonia from selectively exercising its newly
declared authority.
   The revival of Lithuanian nationalism has not been greeted
unanimously in the republic, where 20 percent of the population is
Russian or of other natinality. On Sunday, thousands of mostly
Russian residents of Lithuania gathered in central Vilnius to
demonstrate against a new law defining Lithuanian as a state
language.
   The crowd was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 by Medalinskas and
100,000 by the Communist Party newspaper Pravda.
   The New York-based Lithuanian Information Center said eight
Americans involved in emigre groups were denied visas to attend the
celebrations. The center quoted government sources as saying
Lithuanian party leader Brazauskas approved the visas but they were
rejected in Moscow.

   Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian in
a stone-throwing clash in the West Bank Thursday and wounded eight
others, Arab doctors said. A 4-year-old Arab girl died of head
injuries suffered in a mysterious explosion.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, doctors at Ittihad Hospital said
25-year-old Issam El Bulbul died of a chest wound suffered in a
stone-throwing clash with soldiers. The army had no immediate
comment.
   Arab reports said troops opened fire while pursuing Palestinians
who hurled rocks at an army patrol in Nablus' Old City.
   The death raised to 381 the number of Palestinians killed in the
14-month rebellion against Israeli rule. Fifteen Israelis also have
died.
   Palestinian doctors at east Jerusalem's Mukassad Hospital said
Iktimal Abdullah of Tayasir village in the West Bank died of
injuries suffered three days ago when a device she found near her
home exploded. Her 10-year-old brother Naim was wounded.
   A military source confirmed the death.
   The army started an investigation Wednesday into that blast and
into other unexplained explosions in the West Bank that killed two
other Palestinians and wounded eight.
   The air force also has been asked to look into the explosions
after Palestinians reported seeing helicopters in the area of one
incident.
   In other cases, Palestinians accused Israeli soldiers in jeeps of
throwing out explosive devices that lured unsuspecting children. The
army denied it.
   The army deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, has said
previous explosions resulted from children playing with undetonated
shells near firing ranges or flares that fell from training jets.
   The West Bank and Gaza Strip were captured by Israel from Jordan
and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Thursday raised the possibility
of talks involving Palestinians from the occupied territories and
Jordan.
   He said on Israel Television's Arabic-language program that
Palestinian negotiators should be chosen in free elections and
indicated he would be flexible about conditions, such as army
withdrawal from voting areas on election days and guarantees that no
one would interfere with the balloting.
   ``There may be different proposals, (Palestinian) committees, no
army on election day in the areas where elections are held. There
may be different ways to guarantee really free elections,'' Rabin
said.
   He said talks would be on a ``political process that would not
immediately reach a permanent solution. We can't resolve that
problem at once.''
   Controversy flared over a new dialogue developing between
prominent Palestinians, headed by PLO supporter Faisal Husseini, and
liberal Israeli politicians and academics.
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres endorsed the new dialogue and
hinted on armed forces radio that he may take part.
   ``I support meetings with the representatives of Palestinians
from the territories who are not themselves involved in terrorism,''
Peres said.
   Right-wing politicians harshly criticized the talks.
   Yossi Ahimeir, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
the meetings ``will not come to anything. These people are not in
charge of making policy for the state.''
   In Tel Aviv, District Court Judge Arye Segalson sentenced Khalid
Al Kadayem, 19, an Israeli Arab, to three years in prison for
stoning an Israeli passenger train in Lod six months ago, army radio
reported. No one was injured.
   Arab doctors in the Gaza Strip said six Palestinians were wounded
Thursday in protests by teen-agers hurling stones in the Jabaliya,
Shati and Rafah refugee camps and in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood
of Gaza City. They included a 12-year-old boy shot in the leg and a
14-year-old shot in the abdomen.
   The doctors also said they treated a 21-year-old Nablus Arab shot
in the foot and a teen-ager from Jenin who was wounded in the leg.

<HEAD>Kohl Warns Against Forgetting Nazi Era</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday said
West Germans must not forget the Nazi era and must prevent any
possible resurgence of political extremism.
   Kohl also rejected opposition criticism that a West German
history museum to be built in Bonn would gloss over the Nazi period
because that era occurred before the federal republic's founding in
1949.
   ``We envision our history in its entirety, with all of its good
as well as with its horrible sides,'' Kohl said during a
parliamentary debate.
   He proposed that ground be broken this year for the House of the
Federal Republic of Germany's History, a project expected to cost
$49 million.
   Kohl later made a speech in Bonn at the opening of an art
exhibition marking West Germany's 40th birthday anniversary. In that
speech, he stressed that West Germans must never forget the Nazi era
and any tendencies toward radical political extremism from the right
as well as the left must be opposed.
   ``We will not and must now allow the responsibility for this dark
chapter of our history (the Nazi era) to be blotted out,'' Kohl said.
   ``This experience of German history should make it clear that we
must always oppose extremism and the unleashing of irrational
forces,'' he said.
   Much of Kohl's speech focused on West Germany's strengths,
especially the country's successful rebuilding effort after the 1945
defeat of Nazi Germany.
   ``No one could have expected that in a very short time life would
emerge from destruction, hope from despair, and a brand-new culture
from unimaginable chaos,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl's strong remarks seemed at least partially directed at
opposition politicians who have charged the new Bonn history museum,
expected to open in the mid-1990s, would ignore the 1933-45 Nazi
period.
   Kohl said the museum would not present ``an officious, paved-over
picture'' but a thorough and responsible portrayal of the nation and
the events that have influenced it.
   In addition to the Bonn project, intended to present the past 40
years of history, the federal government has embarked on a larger
undertaking in Berlin to present the entire history of Germany and
its peoples.
   West Germany plans 120 different celebrations and festivals this
year to mark the country's 40th birthday.

   About 170 black detainees at a
prison outside Johannesburg halted a 24-day hunger strike Thursday
and proclaimed victory, and anti-apartheid leaders said many
detainees would be freed.
   In Port Elizabeth, however, civil rights workers said 105
detainees at St. Albans prison continued their fast.
   The hunger strikers at Johannesburg's Diepkloof Prison, some of
whom had not eaten since Jan. 23, ended their fast at 7 a.m. ``An
important victory has been won,'' they said in a statement.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, after meeting in Cape Town with
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, said the government had pledged
to free within two weeks a ``substantial number'' of the estimated
1,000 detainees held without charge nationwide.
   Tutu and other activist clergymen emerged from the meeting to
urge a suspension of the hunger strike. Tutu said a decision on
whether to resume the protest would depend on how many detainees are
freed.
   ``The burden is now on the shoulders of Mr. Vlok,'' Tutu said.
``Our goal is to get all the detainees released and then we will
carry on to change the total structure of apartheid.''
   Vlok issued no statement, but his office described the talks as
``a victory for negotiation.'' The state radio said Vlok gave
permission to the Rev. Frank Chikane, general-secretary of the South
African Council of Churches, to visit the hunger strikers and
discuss the developments.
   The church leaders said Vlok promised to give urgent personal
attention to the cases of individual detainees and told the
delegation the death of any hunger striker would be ``too ghastly to
contemplate.''
   ``A very significant move has happened,'' said Tutu. ``It has
given hope to our people that non-violent action can in fact
sometimes achieve goals they have set for themselves.''
   Tutu later received a standing ovation from about 1,500 people at
a church service in support of the detainees.
   ``Never before has minister Vlok and the government been shaking
in their boots like they are today,'' said activist Cheryl Carolus,
who was at the service.
   As people left the service at the Methodist Metropolitan Church
in Cape Town, they found a police water cannon truck, several vans,
constables armed with shotguns, and a colonel warning them with a
loudspeaker that they had two minutes to disperse or police would
take action.
   An angry Tutu spoke with the police colonel, saying, ``I'm going
to see Mr. Vlok and tell him that your attitude is very
unreasonable.''
   Kathleen Satchwell, a lawyer representing several hunger
strikers, said in Johannesbrug that the government indicated a
majority of the roughly 1,000 people detained nationwide would be
freed soon.
   She said it was not clear how many of those released would be
among the estimated 300 detainees at several prisons participating
in the hunger strike.
   Oliver Tambo, president of the African National Congress
guerrilla movement, said in Harare, Zimbabwe, that the latest
developments proved the strike was ``a jolly good idea.''
   The Diepkloof detainees said their decision was based on concern
for the health of some hunger strikers and on Vlok's pledge to
review their cases.
   ``There have been broken promises in the past. We hope that this
is not the case now,'' their statement said. ``We have succeeded in
our principal objection ... to highlight the desperate plight of
detainees.''
   Ms. Satchwell said there was no specific assurance from the
government about who would be freed. But she said officials had told
her releases would begin immediately.
   Another lawyer, Azhar Cachalia, said detainees who had been
fasting since the start of the strike would need several weeks to
regain enough strength to go free.
   He said the government had given no indication it was considering
ending its policy of detention without trial but was seeking a way
to free a substantial number of detainees without losing face.
   An estimated 30,000 people, most of them black activists, have
been detained for varying periods since a national state of
emergency was declared in 1986.
   Among the clergymen who met with Vlok was the Rev. Allan Boesak,
who had fasted since Monday. He said he was suspending his fast for
two weeks because of the prospect of widespread releases.
   The detainees had threatened to starve themselves to death unless
they were freed or put on trial. More than 20 had been hospitalized,
and fears for their health were growing.
   Vlok had said the government cannot be ``blackmailed'' by a
hunger strike, but he met with civil rights lawyers, clergy and
relatives of the strikers to discuss the crisis.

<TEXT>
   The nation suffered the worst pollution of the
decade last summer with high ozone levels and 28 new cities were
added to the list of urban areas where air quality violated federal
standards, according to preliminary findings made public Thursday.
   The findings by the Enviromental Protection Agency were expected
to be the focus of sharp questioning at a congressional hearing
later this month on the effectiveness of federal air pollution laws.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of a House subcommittee on
health and environment, said the latest EPA data, released by his
office, is expected to ``give a strong boost'' to efforts in
Congress to tighten pollution control requirements.
   According to the EPA findings, two-thirds of the agency's 323
monitoring sites reported higher ozone pollution levels last summer
than in any other summer this decade.
   The findings showed that where a comparison could be made, the
average ozone pollution last summer was 5 percent greater than in
l983, which has been widely regarded as the worst year this decade
for ozone pollution. Average pollution last year was 14 percent
higher when compared to l987, the EPA said.
   During l988 there were 26 more metropolitan areas and two largely
rural areas added to the list of cities that had pollution exceeding
federal standards established by law. These areas had a combined
population of nearly 15 million people.
   The information, collected by the EPA from state and local air
pollution control agencies, covered the period from April through
October, 1988, including one of the hottest summers, which officials
said contributed to the high levels of ozone pollution.
   Waxman said the latest data shows that serious air pollution and
urban smog ``now afflicts almost every American city.'' He said more
than 100 million Americans live in cities with higher levels of
ozone and carbon monoxide pollution than is considered safe by the
EPA.
   Carbon monoxide pollution comes from car, bus and truck exhausts,
while ozone pollution is the result of these pollutants as well as
industrial emissions.
   In a letter accompanying the EPA air quality statistics, Donald
Clay, the agency's acting assistant administrator for air and
radiation, said that the data was preliminary and had not yet gone
through ``the normal validation procedures.''

<HEAD>Squad Set Up To Check Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said
Thursday it has created a special mobile fraud squad to conduct
investigations at savings and loan institutions.
   The agency, which insures deposits at commercial banks, last week
began taking control of more than 200 insolvent S&amp;Ls under orders
from President Bush.
   ``Our new fraud squad will be dispatched to the scene whenever
our on-sight teams discover evidence of fraud or insider abuse,''
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said in a speech prepared for
delivery to a group of accountants in Minneapolis.
   James Dudine, a section chief in the FDIC's division of bank
supervision, will dispatch fraud teams selected from among 80
specially trained bank examiners.
   In another development, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.,
Freddie Mac, recommended Thursday the Bush administration
restructure the Freddie Mac board of directors as part of its plan
for the savings and loan crisis.
   Freddie Mac was created by Congress in 1970 to provide money for
home mortgages by purchasing the mortgages, packaging them into
securities and reselling them to investors.
   Currently, it is controlled by three directors who also comprise
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates savings and loan
institutions. Bush has proposed that the bank board be shrunk to one
member, who would become an official of the Treasury Department.
   The current Freddie Mac board said it should be replaced by a
13-member board, chaired by the remaining bank board chairman. The
other 12 board members would include four government officials, two
presidential appointees, three members elected by public
shareholders and three directors elected by the other 10 directors.
   Meanwhile, a Chicago-based think tank, the Mid America Institute
for Public Policy Research, said the bank board had given it a
$148,000 grant to conduct an ``independent study'' of regulators'
year-end spree of 75 savings and loan rescues. Congress' General
Accounting Office is also reviewing the deals.

   North Korea has agreed to let Western
companies join in developing a resort area around scenic Mount
Kumgang in the north, South Korean business tycoon Chung Ju-yung
says.
   Chung, founder of South Korea's largest business conglomerate
Hyundai, told reporters on Wednesday that he proposed Western
participation during his recent visit to Pyongyang, the northern
capital, and the communist side consented.
   Chung said that during his Jan. 23-Feb. 1 visit, he and the north
exchanged documents agreeing to jointly undertake the resort project
if the two governments agree. He did not say how much the project
would cost.
   Chung said he plans to form a consortium with U.S., Japanese,
British, West German and other Western companies to build hotels and
other facilities. He said South Korean firms also may join.
   North Korea, with a low international credit rating, has so far
failed to attract meaningful foreign investment in joint ventures in
the north.
   Chung said he hopes to combine the north's steel, cement and
labor with the south's capital and technology in developing the
Kumgang project.
   He plans to return to the north with engineers in April to
discuss details and for feasibilty studies.

<HEAD>Close Friend Of Mitterrand Charged In Stock Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A close friend of President Francois Mitterrand and
four other people were charged Thursday in an insider trading
scandal, judicial sources said.
   Roger-Patrice Pelat confirmed he was charged with receiving
insider information that allowed him to buy shares of the U.S.
company Triangle Industries Inc. shortly before the state-owned
aluminum maker Pechiney SA offered a higher price in a successful
takeover.
   ``I am a bit surprised, but it seems that this is the normal
procedure,'' Pelat, a retired businessman, told reporters after
meeting with investigating Magistrate Edith Boizette.
   Three men were charged with insider trading: Paris stockbrokers
Pierre-Alain Marsan and Ricardo Zavala and an officer in a Paris
investment company, Robert Reiplinger, the judicial sources said on
condition of anonymity.
   The sources said Pelat and a friend, Isabelle Pierco, were
charged with receiving the information and profiting from it. The
charge carries the same maximum penalty as insider trading: two
years in prison and a fine of up to four times the amount illicitly
gained in the deal.
   Pelat, 70, bought 10,000 shares of Triangle stock for himself,
his wife and his two sons on Nov. 16, half for $10 a share and half
for $10.75 a share.
   At that time, Pechiney's takeover offer of $56 per share had been
negotiated and submitted to senior French government officials for
approval. The bid was made public on Nov. 21, sending Triangle's
stock price soaring.
   Pelat sold his and his family's shares during the following week,
getting more than four times the price he had just paid, for a total
profit of about $350,000.
   In a televised interview Sunday, Mitterrand said he knew Pelat as
a man of courage and integrity from their years together in the
French resistance, and before that in a German prisoner of war camp
in 1940.
   ``We were a small group who remained very close. It is rare that
prisoners of war, in such circumstances of misery and solitude, show
as much strength of soul, character and friendship'' as Pelat did,
Mitterrand said.
   But he said if Pelat were found guilty of an offense, ``then in
my role as president I would not be able to maintain the same kind
of friendship I have had with him for so long.''
   On Wednesday, Pelat resigned from the board of directors of Air
France, a spokeswoman for the state-owned airline confirmed Thursday.
   Pelat has said he was tipped to buy Triangle stock by a friend,
Max Theret, a businessman with longstanding ties to the Socialist
Party. Theret, who bought 32,300 Triangle shares the day before
Pelat's purchase, said he came up with the idea from his own stock
research and denied getting inside information.
   Theret has not been charged. He has been hospitalized in recent
weeks with a heart ailment, and French law requires that an
investigating magistrate notify a suspect face-to-face of criminal
charges.

   The lawyer for Rock Hudson's lover asked a
jury Thursday to double its $14.5 million award as a message to the
world that those with AIDS have a duty to warn their sexual partners.
   ``If you bring in a verdict like the one you brought in
yesterday, you know the world is going to know about it,'' said
attorney Harold Rhoden, arguing in the second phase of the
precedent-setting civil trial.
   Jurors began deliberating the issue of punitive and exemplary
damages after receiving legal instructions from Superior Court Judge
Bruce Geernaert. The panel met for 2{ hours before retiring, and was
to resume Friday morning.
   Rhoden called the jurors' decision Wednesday in favor of Marc
Christian ``magnificent,'' and predicted that further damages would
produce headlines reading: ``Rock Hudson Jury Does It Again.'' The
jury award was believed to be the first to a plaintiff who had not
developed any signs of AIDS infection.
   Rhoden urged jurors to assess another $14.5 million in exemplary
and punitive damages against Hudson's secretary and confidant Mark
Miller, who the jury found helped the actor conceal the sexually
transmitted, fatal disease from his lover.
   Miller was held liable for actual damages Wednesday along with
the Hudson estate. Arguments for additional damages focused only on
Miller because the law bars awarding punitive or exemplary damages
from the estate of a dead person.
   ``There are countless millions of people involved, people who may
benefit by your verdict, if it makes an example of Mark Miller,''
Rhoden said.
   He said that those with AIDS would no longer keep it secret from
their sex partners if they knew it could result in a huge damage
award.
   ``The message has been sent,'' countered Miller's lawyer, Andrew
Banks. ``It's echoed around the world. Now please exercise caution.''
   Christian sued on grounds that he suffered emotional distress and
``enhanced fear'' that he might contract AIDS. He consistently has
tested negative for presence of the AIDS virus, but his lawyer says
that is no guarantee that he will not develop AIDS in the future.
   Banks asked jurors not to vent any anger they feel toward Hudson
on Miller.
   ``He's not the person who had sex with Marc Christian,'' the
lawyer said. ``If you're angry at Rock Hudson, I ask you to set all
the feelings about Rock Hudson aside and consider Mark Miller. There
is no need to hit Mark Miller again. ... The purpose is not to be
mean spirited or evil.''
   Jurors found Wednesday that both Hudson and Miller were guilty of
``outrageous conduct'' for withholding the movie star's AIDS
diagnosis from the young man who shared his bed for two years.
   The jurors heard seven weeks of often explicit testimony about
the late star's sex life, and their award exceeded the amount
Christian had sought in compensatory damages by $3.5 million.
   Miller testified that his assets total less than $100,000, and
his lawyer said the award Wednesday ``has wiped him out.'' Rhoden
disputed that, but Geernaert toldf jurors to disregard both
attorneys' comments concerning Miller's net worth.
   Rhoden has said that Miller stands to inherit millions from the
Hudson will. It also has been suggested that he may be insured for a
portion of the verdict.
   Christian, 35, an aspiring musician, testified that he became
Hudson's live-in lover in 1983 and didn't learn that the actor had
AIDS until it was announced to the world in July 1985. Hudson died
Oct. 5, 1985, at age 58.

   Damage to the pristine Antarctic
environment from an Argentine ship that ran aground and leaked oil
appears to be less than initially feared, a U.S. scientist reported
Thursday .
   ``There were not thousands of birds killed. What we saw was the
death of a few birds and there may be more,'' said Ted DeLaca, chief
of the Division of Polar Programs of the Washington-based National
Science Foundation.
   ``Some said this was an eco-catastrophe of biblical proportions.
That clearly is not true. Others said it was nothing. That's not
true, either. The truth is somewhere in between.''
   Many krill, a small, shrimplike crustacean that is the main food
for whalebone whales, washed up on islands after the Bahia Paraiso
ran aground on Jan. 28 and began leaking fuel oil.
   The Argentine navy oceanographic vessel had been chartered for a
tourist excursion.
   The accident took place near the U.S. polar research station
Palmer on the Antarctic peninsula, 600 miles below the tip of South
America. DeLaca was on the scene and helped organize the transfer of
tourists from ship to land by motorized rubber boats.
   The partially submerged ship was carrying an estimated 800 tons
of diesel oil, butane, compressed gas and other fuel, which
immediately began to leak. How much leaked and how much will be
recovered was not known, DeLaca said.
   He said some penguins and cormorants died after ingesting oil or
getting it on themselves, and thousands of limpets, a small, marine
animal, also died.
   However, navy experts from Argentina and Chile and scientists
aboard the foundation vessel Polar Duke quickly recovered floating
fuel canisters, patched the Bahia Paraiso's hull, stopped the leak
and contained the spill and now are cleaning it up.
   ``For the most part, the stuff that went into the water seems to
have dispersed and gone away,'' DeLaca, a bearded, 45-year-old
marine microbiologist, said in an interview.
   The concern now is what possible long-term effects the spill may
have on animal and plant life and on research such as that conducted
at Palmer since 1970.
   ``The Antarctic is a hostile, unforgiving environment,'' DeLaca
said. ``The organisms that live there are specially adapted. The
margins for survival are narrow. ... Anything that takes away an
edge, that compromises their fitness, could mean the difference
between life and death.''
   He said ingesting oil may affect the penguins' capacity to store
oxygen and thus their ability to dive deep for food. Oil on the
feathers of skuas, a large predator bird related to the seagull,
could affect their ability to float or stay warm.
   Lack of limpets and krill near a nesting may affect breeding
patterns and the ability of young creatures to survive, he said.
   He said researchers also will wonder now whether the results they
obtain are valid, or a reflection of the oil spill.
   ``This is the first significant spill in Antarctica,'' DeLaca
said. ``It was a pristine environment and experimental results were
taken as accurate indicators of the Antarctic environment. This
spill could call into question future results.''
   A team of scientists from the United States, Argentina and Chile
will arrive at Palmer Station next month to collect data before
winter sets in.
   ``When next spring comes is when the story will be told'' about
the damage caused by the spill, DeLaca said.
   ``The environment will recover. No question about that. The
question is, is what comes back what was there before.''

<HEAD>Former City Officials Convicted In Settlement Of Voting Rights Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DANVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five former city officials have been
convicted of illegally guaranteeing themselves jobs as part of a
settlement of a federal voting rights lawsuit, a prosecutor said
Thursday.
   Craig DeArmond, the Vermilion County state's attorney who
prosecuted the non-jury criminal case in December, announced the
decision, which Circuit Judge Paul Komada issued in writing earlier
this week.
   The charges resulted from an agreement in 1987 to do away with
city's system of electing commissioners at large, which blacks
challenged as discriminatory. While instituting a ward system of
electing aldermen, the settlement also kept the four commissioners
on the municipal payroll for three years as executives.
   The former commissioners, Wilbur Scharlau, Ernie Cox, Jerome
Brown and Raymond Randall, were convicted, along with city attorney
Wendell Wright of charges including official misconduct and conflict
of interest.
   ``You can't commit state crimes while settling a federal
voting-rights case,'' said DeArmond. ``Our quarrel was with the
guarantee of jobs to themselves. That's self-dealing ... illegal.''
   ``Generally, I'm disappointed. I think it is the intention of the
defendants to appeal,'' said defense attorney Everett Laury.
   Wright, Randall and Cox have resigned their city jobs. Scharlau
and Brown remained on the payroll.
   DeArmond said the men could face a maximum sentence of five years
in prison. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for April 7.
   When the men were indicted in July 1987, defense attorney Matt
Lydon contended they had negotiated in good faith to reach a voting
rights settlement that would assure a smooth transition in the city
government. He also noted that U.S. District Judge Harold Baker of
Danville had approved the settlement.
   ``The bottom line was regardless of their motivation ...
everything was done in a federal court case and presented to the
court to determine whether it was proper,'' Laury said Thursday.
   Baker set the indictments aside in August 1987. But the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated them last April, saying Baker
``probably did not mean to approve the manner of negotiation,'' just
the substance of the settlement.
   The Rev. Roosevelt Davis, one of the black residents who filed
the suit, has said that the plaintiffs did not want the former
commissioners guaranteed city jobs for three years. However, he said
that was necessary in order to gain the settlement.
   Before the settlement, no black had been elected to the city
council in the 60 years the mayor-commissioner system was in place.
About 16 percent of Danville's 39,000 residents are black. After the
mayor-aldermanic form of government began, 14 people, including two
blacks, were elected to the city council from seven wards.

   The 33-nation council of the U.N. aviation agency
Thursday ordered an urgent study of whether new measures are needed
to meet the security threat posed by terrorist sabotage.
   At a meeting requested by the United States and Britain, the
International Aviation Organization council condemned ``all acts of
unlawful interference against international civil aviation,''
including the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed all
259 people aboard and 11 on the ground in Scotland.
   The U.S. and British transportation secretaries told reporters
they considered the two-day meeting of the ICAO advisory body
successful and were satisfied there would be a quick review of
security requirements.
   Samual K. Skinner of the United States said: ``The international
airline traveler can be assured that additional steps are now being
taken, as a result of this meeting, to make international air travel
an even safer mode of transportation.''
   Among issues to be addressed in the review are detecting sabotage
devices, especially explosives, and screening of checked luggage,
passengers and carry-on bags.
   Security problems created by portable radios, computers and other.
   Recommendations for any changes in international standards could
be ready bu late spring or early summer for consideration by the
ICAO membership of 160 nations.
   Paul Channon, the British transportation secretary, suggested a
rule requiring passengers with electronic devices to carry them onto
the plane rather than checking them.
   ``To ban radios altogether would be a very drastic step,'' but it
might have to be considered, he said.
   Allan McArtor, head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration,
said new guidance was issued in Washington after Thursday's
announcement in Scotland.
   ``The guidance is more a sense of vigilance than anything else,''
he told reporters.
   Although passengers can expect electronic devices to be checked
more rigorously, an outright ban on carrying them is unlikely,
McArtor said.
   Channon said the costs of increased security might eventually be
reflected in increased ticket prices, but ``we're not talking about
large sums of money.''
   The organization's staff also will be considering whether new
steps are needed to increase the matching of passengers and their
bags, to consider the security problem of cargo, mail and courier
services using passenger aircraft and to control access to airports.
   It also will be discussing the possibility of taking security
considerations into account in the design of aircraft. Channon said,
however, that any design changes would be minor.

   Psychiatrists could not have predicted that a
former mental patient would suddenly become homicidal, the head of
Maryland's hospital for the criminally insane said Thursday.
   ``I don't think anyone had the capacity a week ago to predict his
actions,'' said Steven Siebert.
   But Wednesday afternoon, Emanuel Tsegaye, a former patient at the
Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center walked onto the seventh floor of
the Chevy Chase Federal Savings Bank in Bethesda, Md. where he
worked, shot four co-workers and then turned the gun on himself,
according to Montgomery County police.
   Fatally wounded were Cynthia Mitchell, 28, of Landover; Tanya
Walker, 23, of Fort Washington; and Mahasty Agha-Khan, 29, of Silver
Spring. The lone survivor of the shooting spree, Edward Johnson, 22,
was listed in critical condition at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda
with a gunshot wound to the face.
   Police spokesman George Ludington said investigators were probing
reports that Tsegaye was a ``disgruntled employee,'' in the bank's
Visa credit card department but said the motive for the shooting has
not been determined.
   As recently as Feb. 6, the therapist who had been seeing Tsegaye
biweekly since he was released from the hospital more than two years
ago said the 33-year-old debt collector was functioning well in the
community.
   Nevertheless, Siebert said no mistakes were made in the decision
to release Tsegaye from Perkins in the fall of 1986.
   ``I have not found anything which would make me question the
release decision which was made two years ago,'' he said, explaining
that Tsegaye was never violent to others during his two-year stay at
the facility.
   Tsegaye was sent to Perkins in April 1984, after he approached a
policeman with a knife, pleading with the officer to kill him and a
county circuit judge ruled that Tsegaye was not criminally
responsible for his action, said Siebert.
   Tsegaye's release came after he was evaluated by a treatment
team, an outside mental health professional reviewed the decision
and the judge who originally sent him to the institution was
notified.
   Tsegaye had been seen regularly by a psychiatrist and a social
worker since his release, and had stayed in several halfway houses
before moving into an apartment in Silver Spring, according to
Siebert.
   However Tsegaye had suffered some setbacks, Siebert said.
   Tsegaye was admitted to Washington Adventist Hospital for a week
for treatment of depression last spring, hospital officials said.
   And in July, the Community Forensic Aftercare Office notified the
Montgomery County State's Attorney's Office that Tsegaye was not
keeping his clinic appointments at Hamilton House, a residential
halfway house in Baltimore where he was scheduled for counseling.
   However hospital officials said Tsegaye had resumed his
couseling, and just last week his therapist reported Tsegaye was
complying with the terms of his conditional release.
   Tsegaye had been briefly hospitalized for mental problems five
times before, Siebert said, dating back to the late 1970s when he
reported hearing voices while still in his native Ethiopia.
   Tsegaye had been diagnosed primarily with depression, but St.
Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, where he stayed for three days in
July 1983, diagnosed him as suffering schizoaffective disorder.
   At Perkins, Tsegaye was diagnosed as suffering from bipolar
syndrome or manic depression which was characterized by bouts of
extreme depression, said Siebert.
   One person in 20 suffers from some type of bilopar syndrome,
Siebert said, and 99 percent never perform a violent act, according
to Siebert.
   Siebert and Janet Klein Brown, an attorney assigned to Perkins by
the State's Attorney's office, insisted Tsegaye also had never
demonstrated violent tendencies.
   ``He was in for a suicidal gesture, not violent behavior,'' said
Siebert. During Tsegaye's two years at Perkins, he was involved in
scuffles just three times, and he was never the instigator, Siebert
said.
   ``If we have an inkling that a person is going to be a risk to a
co-worker or employer, we would never recommend that person for
release,'' Siebert said.
   ``I do not have a good explanation for the criminal behavior
yesterday,'' said Siebert, adding there also was no way to know if
Tsegaye's actions were related to his prior mental problems.
   Ms. Brown said the bank wasn't notified of Tsegaye's history
because he wasn't considered a danger and state law doesn't require
notification.
   Authorities aren't sure how Tesgaye, with a background of mental
illness, was able to obtain a gun.
   Perkins has begun an intensive review into the incident, with the
help of outside consultants, Siebert said.

   A 19-year-old man facing charges here in the
fatal stabbing of a teen-age boy and the abduction of a teen-age
girl was being returned Thursday from New Mexico, where he was
arrested.
   Michael Ardila had been held since Tuesday in Santa Rosa, N.M.,
where he was captured when his car overturned during a chase by
state police.
   Ardila is charged in the death of Anthony Pompelio, 17, and the
abduction of Donna Shaban, 17, both of nearby Sparta. Pompelio was
killed early Sunday when he tried to break up an argument between
Ardila and Miss Shaban at the home of a friend.
   Ardila also is accused of stealing a Jeep Cherokee belonging to
Pompelio's father. He waived extradition during a court hearing
Wednesday. Ardila is unemployed and lives in Wantage Township.
   Authorities said Ardila was due to arrive by plane shortly after
midnight. He is scheduled for arraignment Friday at Sussex County
Courthouse in this northwestern New Jersey community.
   Miss Shaban was found Tuesday near Groom, Texas. She told police
Ardila pushed her from the Jeep Cherokee as they drove down a
highway. She returned to New Jersey early Wednesday.
   Pompelio was buried Thursday after a funeral attended by 500
people, including his classmates at Sparta High School.
   ``He was a faithful young man who died defending another,'' said
Monsignor Francis J. Bischoff during services at St. Michael's Roman
Catholic Church in nearby Netcong. ``He would never hurt anyone. He
was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.''

<HEAD>Peru Miners Strike, Two Killed in Guerrilla Attack</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miners across Peru staged a daylong strike
Thursday to protest the slaying of labor leader Saul Cantoral and
said he was killed by a guerrilla group linked to the governemnt.
   Also Thursday, police said Maoist Shining Path guerrillas killed
one policeman and wounded two in an attack a day earlier on a police
post near Chincha, 100 miles south of Lima.
   Other Maoist rebels shot and killed a former governing party
economic development worker in Huancayo, 140 miles east of Lima,
police said.
   The National Mining Society, an organization of mine owners, said
it could not confirm how many of the nation's estimated 70,000
miners stayed off the job Thursday.
   Cantoral, secretary-general of the leftist-led miners' federation
and one of Peru's most powerful labor leaders, was shot to death
late Monday. A female companion was run down by a car and killed in
a Lima slum.
   Government officials blamed the killings on political extremists
and said an investigation was under way to determine if the
attackers were from the Shining Path, the anti-rebel group Rodrigo
Franco Command, or an ultra-right death squad not previously known.
   The miners' federation accused the Rodrigo Franco Command of
carrying out the attack, and it linked the group to the governing
center-left Aprista Party.
   The government has denied any connection with the Franco band,
which emerged a year ago vowing to kill leftist guerrillas and their
supporters.
   Cantoral, 42, became the focus of controversy last year when he
led miners in two crippling national strikes. The walkouts caused
losses of $400 million, one-third of the annual exports from Peru's
most important industry.
   The strikes failed to force mine owners to accept a federation
demand that labor contracts of mine unions be negotiated jointly
rather than on the current union-by-union basis.
   The mine owners charged repeatedly that the strikes were being
manipulated by the Shining Path, which officials said has begun to
infiltrate labor unions.
   The federation in January decided to strike again over labor
contracts. Federation spokesman Leonardo Ramirez said Thursday the
strike is tentatively set for sometime in March.

<HEAD>One Charge Dropped Against Navy Captain In Cannibalism Incident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A military judge on
Thursday dropped one of three charges against a Navy captain accused
of abandoning scores of Vietnamese refugees who later resorted to
cannibalism to survive at sea.
   The judge ruled prosecutors failed to present evidence that Capt.
Alexander Balian, former skipper of the USS Dubuque, refused to
assist a man who tried to swim to the warship when it crossed paths
with the refugee boat on June 9.
   Balian faces another charge of ``wrongfully failing to render
assistance'' to a second Vietnamese who also tried to swim to the
Dubuque, and a third charge of dereliction of duty for failing to
render adequate assistance to the other refugees.
   If convicted, Balian could be sentenced to two years and three
months in jail, forfeiture of all benefits and dismissal from the
service.
   The military judge, Capt. James Freyer, ordered the first charge
dropped on a motion of defense lawyer Dan Donato as soon as the
prosecution rested its case on the fifth day of Balian's
court-martial.
   The Dubuque was en route to the Persian Gulf when it encountered
the refugee boat 230 miles north of the Philippine island of
Palawan. The boat, crammed with 83 Vietnamese, had been at sea since
leaving Vietnam on May 22.
   United Nations officials in Manila said nearly 20 other refugees
died of starvation before the encounter with the Dubuque and only 52
survived when the ``boat people'' were rescued by Filipino fishermen
on June 27.
   The survivors told officials that after provisions given by the
Dubuque crew ran out, they survived by eating the flesh of five
refugees, including three who were slain.
   Balian, 48, of Los Angeles, was relieved of his command in
August. Court-martial charges were filed in December.
   In addition to dropping the first charge, the judge also
instructed the six Navy captains who sit as the jury to ignore one
of 11 allegations to back up the dereliction charge, which is
punishable with three months in prison.
   The allegation was that Balian had failed to provide the refugees
with medical supplies. Witnesses who testified earlier said the
refugees replied to repeated questions that no one among them was
sick.
   The other allegations backing the dereliction charge include
failure to adequately inspect the refugee vessel for its
seaworthiness.
   On Wednesday, a witness testified he saw four Vietnamese jump
from their boat and swim toward the Dubuque. Three of them swam back
when they saw two rubber boats from the Dubuque approaching their
craft with food supplies.
   The prosecution says at least two Vietnamese drowned.
   But the witness, Ensign Allen Esperum, testified Balian gave
orders to check the floating body of the Vietnamese to ``make sure
he is not faking it.'' He added he observed ``no movement'' in the
body and it was left at sea.

<HEAD>U.S. Air Force Cancels Air Shows In West Germany For 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAMSTEIN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after a fiery air show
crash at a U.S. base killed 70 people, the U.S. Air Force said
Thursday it had canceled all its air shows in West Germany this year.
   Air Force spokesman Capt. Kevin Krejcarek said the decision by
Commanding Gen. William Kirk applies to all flyovers and aerial
demonstrations for the general public at Air Force installations in
West Germany.
   On Aug. 28, three Italian stunt jets collided in flight over the
Ramstein Air Base, and one of the flaming planes plowed into a crowd
of spectators. In addition to the 70 killed, hundreds of people were
injured.
   That crash, and a series of NATO training flight crashes in West
Germany last year that killed more than 100 people, caused a public
outcry and demands for a stop to low-level military flights
throughout the country.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Krejcarek
said the order also applies to ``open houses for the public,''
events regularly staged in the past by the Air Force to permit
Germans to familiarize themselves with the U.S. military in Europe.
   However, Krejcarek said some air installations still may stage
displays of aircraft for members of the military and ``invited
guests only.''
   The U.S. military's unofficial Stars and Stripes newspaper
reported Thursday that the leftist Social Democrats and Greens
parties in the Ramstein area had stepped up their campaign against
air shows by circulating petitions and writing letters to newspapers
and U.S. officials.
   The newspaper quoted Ramstein Mayor Julius Divivier as saying
Kirk's move was ``a wise and good decision.'' Ramstein is about 65
miles southwest of Frankfurt.

   The Republican Party rolled out its big guns
Thursday _ President Bush and former President Reagan _ to keep a
former Ku Klux Klan leader from being elected to the Legislature as
a member of the GOP.
   Letters touting Bush's endorsement of ex-Klansman David Duke's
opponent in the state House race were circulated throughout the
district, while radio commercials featuring Reagan's familiar voice
were broadcast throughout the day.
   ``I can't help but tell you of the high regard I have for one
candidate in the race for the 81st district _ John Treen,'' Reagan
said in the radio spot for the conservative house builder and
longtime Republican.
   Duke, 38, countered with a paid half-hour broadcast on a New
Orleans television in which he declared that neither Bush nor Reagan
knows anything about the issues in the local race.
   ``George Bush hasn't walked in the Irish-Italian parade as I have
down Metairie Road. George Bush hasn't eaten at the lakefront in
Bucktown,'' Duke said.
   ``I know the people of the district _ not George Bush or Ronald
Reagan. I respect both of those men but all I can respond is ...
read my lips, George Bush. No new taxes, and David Duke basically
has the same kind of program that George Bush has advanced.''
   Treen, 63, and Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan,
are in a runoff Saturday to represent the nearly all-white district
in Metairie, a New Orleans suburb. Duke, who sought the 1988
Democratic presidential nomination but registered Republican in the
fall, led a field of seven candidates with 33 percent of the vote in
the Jan. 21 primary. Treen had 19 percent.
   Under Louisiana's open primary system, the top two vote-getters
in a primary, regardless of party, face each other in the runoff if
no candidate gets half the primary votes. The seat opened when
Metairie's representative was elected to a judgeship.
   The presidential-level endorsements for a state House seat may
have unprecedented.
   ``This is the first time for sure that Ronald Reagan has ever
done it to my knowledge for a state legislative race,'' said state
Republican Party Chairman William Nungesser.
   Bush and Reagan didn't mention Duke in their endorsements, but
state and national Republican officials made it clear that a Duke
victory would harm the party.
   ``It's as if Attila the Hun joined our party,'' said Nungesser.
``All of the sudden Attila the Hun is a Republican candidate. I
don't believe he's changed one bit.''
   ``He is not a Republican and should not pass himself off to be a
Republican,'' said Leslie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Republican
National Committee in Washington. ``We can tolerate a lot in this
party, but the one thing we cannot tolerate is intolerance.''
   ``It has to be political favors being called in,'' Duke said
after Treen received the presidential endorsements. ``I'm really
tired of this. The outside interference in this race is absolutely
ridiculous. It's like the establishment is closing the ranks to
prevent an independent from coming through.''
   Duke has been campaigning door to door this week as publicity
heated up in the race.
   Treen said he received the endorsement from Reagan after a mutual
friend whom he would not identify asked the former president to get
involved.
   Treen was state campaign chairman for Bush's 1980 presidential
bid. His brother, Dave, was Louisiana governor from 1980 to 1984.
   The commercials were paid for by Treen's campaign. Neither Treen
nor Nungesser would say how much they cost.
   Duke has disavowed the Klan, which he said he left in 1980 after
being accused of selling secret membership rolls. He heads a group
called the National Association for the Advancement of White People,
which he says is not racist but a group seeking human rights for
everybody.
   He is opposed to welfare and affirmative action and supports
Louisiana's $75,000 homestead tax exemption.

<HEAD>Searle Motion For New Trial Denied In $8.15 Million Copper-7 Verdict</HEAD>

   A federal judge Thursday refused to
overturn an $8.15 million award against the G.D. Searle &amp; Co. in the
case of a woman who said her infertility was caused by a Searle
birth control device.
   Searle asked for a new trial, claiming juror misconduct, errors
of evidence and excessive punitive damages.
   A U.S. District Court jury last September ordered Searle to pay
$8.15 million to Esther Kociemba, of Elk River. The verdict
supported her claim that a Searle Copper-7 intrauterine birth
control device had triggered a pelvic infection that left her
infertile.
   ``Searle clearly believes that a new trial was warranted based on
the evidence of jury misconduct,'' the company said in a statement
after Judge Robert Renner issued his ruling.
   Searle, based in Skokie, Ill., said it would appeal Renner's
decision to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   In denying Searle's motions for a new trial, Renner said the
court does not condone improper actions of the jurors. However, he
added, ``after reviewing the record and hearing the testimony of the
individual jurors, the court concludes that the defendant was not
denied a fair trial.''
   The judge said he did not find the verdict excessive.
   The jury verdict was the first award of punitive damages against
Searle for a Copper-7-related illness and it was the largest award.
   About 500 lawsuits have been filed over the Copper-7, the most
widely used IUD in the United States before it was withdrawn from
the U.S. market in January 1986.

<HEAD>Angola Says 108 Rebels Slain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angola said Thursday that 108 rebels were
killed during six days of fighting earlier this month in southern
Angola.
   The official Angolan news agency ANGOP said one South African
soldier also died in the fighting Feb. 8-14 in southern Cuando
Cubango province, south of the town of Caiundo. The report was
monitored in Lisbon.
   Angola claims South African forces invaded Cuando Cubango Feb. 8
to support the guerrilla group known as the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola.
   The rebels deny South African forces entered Angola and say the
fighting led to heavy government losses.
   The ANGOP report claimed the guerrillas were forced to abandon
the offensive after defeats from government forces.
   On Feb. 10, the Angolan government formally protested to South
Africa, saying the invasion broke a regional peace agreement signed
in New York in December.
   South Africa also denies it invaded the southern province and has
called for a meeting of a joint verification commission set up to
monitor the peace accord.
   Under the terms of the U.S.-brokered agreement, South Africa is
barred from aiding the guerrilla group and is to grant independence
to Angola's southern neighbor, Namibia.
   As part of the agreement, about 50,000 Cuban troops have begun
withdrawing from Angola, where they have been helping the Marxist
government fight the U.S.- and South African-backed rebels.
   The rebels, who reject the peace agreement, claimed in a
statement distributed in Lisbon on Thursday that they killed 56
government fighters in two clashes in northern Angola.
   The rebel statement said 51 government troops died during a rebel
attack in Uige province Feb. 14, and five perished in a rebel ambush
the previous day in Malange.

   A fire broke out in the engine room of a Indian ship
while it was in dry dock on Thursday, killing 10 Japanese dock
workers, police said.
   The fire aboard the 13,392-ton vessel was put out early Friday
and police found the 10 bodies near the ship's engine room, police
spokesman Tadao Kojima said. Firefighters battled the blaze for 12
hours.
   The blaze aboard the Jag Doot broke out near the ship's engine

miles south of Tokyo, said Kojima. The cause of fire is still
unknown, he said.
   An NKK official declined to comment on the accident.
   Two females were among the victims of the fire, Kojima said.
   Fire official Mitsuyuki Ishido said 27 dockworkers and some
Indian crewmen were working near the engine room when the fire broke
out. Police said five Indians suffered burns.
   The Jag Doot, owned by Great Eastern Shipping Co. of Bombay,
India, had entered the dry dock earlier Thursday for inspection and
repairs, according to officials.

<HEAD>Police Arrest American Suspected of Spying on Judge For Scientologists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Thursday arrested an American
suspected of acting on behalf of the Church of Scientology to
investigate the private life of a judge looking into fraud and tax
evasion charges against the church here.
   A police spokesman said police arrested Humberto Juan Fontana,
33, a native of Havana and reportedly a Church of Scientology
member, and confiscated three dossiers containing information of a
confidential nature.
   No hometown was available for Fontana, the spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
   Other charges against the Scientology members involve criminal
association. The judge has said that Narconon, a church-linked drug
rehabilitation program, swindled its clients and lured them into
Scientology.
   Defense lawyer Jose Luis Chamorro told reporters police raided
his office and home Thursday and removed papers from his home.
   The spokesman said dossiers confiscated from Fontana contained
information pertaining to District Court Judge Jose Maria Vazquez
Honrubia and to Pilar Salarullana, a Christian Democratic member of
Parliament and an expert on religious sects active in Spain.
   He said the arrest came on the judge's orders after Vazquez
Honrubia learned that the church purportedly hired a Barcelona-based
detective agency to look into his private affairs.
   After a nine-month investigation into Scientiology activities in
Spain last year, Vazquez Honrubia ordered a raid Nov. 20 on a
meeting of church officials in a Madrid hotel. Seventy-one people
were arrested, including Heber Jentzsch, president of the
International Church of Scientology.
   After questioning all those arrested, the judge ordered 10
foreigners expelled and 50 others released.
   He released Jentzsch and the remaining 10 from two Madrid prisons
on Dec. 10 after they posted total bail of $1.1 million and agreed
to remain in Spain and report before the court three times a week.
   Jentzsch, 53, a native of Salt Lake City and a resident of Los
Angeles, has repeatedly denied any personal wrongdoing in comments
to reporters.
   Ms. Salarullana told reporters on Thursday that Vazquez Honrubia
showed her one confiscated dossier that contained data on her bank
accounts, family documents, photos and public comments she has made
concerning the Scientology church and sects active in Spain.
   Contacted at home by telephone, Vazquez Honrubia told The
Associated Press Fontana would stay in jail at least overnight until
the judge could question him about the dossiers and decide if
Fontana was to be released or held pending further investigation.
   Under Spanish law, a suspect can be held for 72 hours before
being formally arraigned.

<TEXT>
   The sunshine that peeked through on
Thursday only illuminated the swirling, muddy water that has covered
much of central and western Kentucky in the worst flooding in more
than a decade.
   ``I feel confident that in almost all areas, that the situation
has stabilized,'' said Ronn Padgett, of the state Division of
Disaster and Emergency Services.
   Almost every river, creek and stream in the western two-thirds of
the state was sent out of its banks with rain that topped 10 inches
in some places. Flooding sent hundreds of people out of their homes,
and roads were closed by high water in 82 of the state's 120
counties.
   Some roads reopened Thursday as waters receded.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, who took a helicopter tour of some
affected areas Thursday afternoon, said the state had had more than
its share of bad luck recently with the summer drought in 1988 and
now the flooding.
   ``If you have a nice, effective prayer you can say for us, you
can say it,'' he said.
   Officials hoped for a respite with a weather forecast that
contained little chance of rain until Friday.
   ``It sure looks like it's over, barring anything unforeseen,''
said Alex Beauvois, forecaster for the National Weather Service in
Louisville. He said the forecast called for one-fourth to one-half
inch of rain or less on Friday.
   A state of emergency remained in effect Thursday with nearly 200
National Guard troops patrolling flooded areas to provide security
to abandoned property. Guardsmen were also involved in two rescues
near Frankfort.
   Sgt. Jeff Oliver waded in water up to his chest to a group of
stranded campers, and Sgt. Kenny Moore saved a woman and child whose
pickup truck was being carried away in the swollen Kentucky River.
   Adjutant General Michael Davidson said troops would remain on
duty as long as needed, but added, ``My gut feeling is we're over
the hump on this.''
   The hardest hit area was in Christian County on the Tennessee
border, where nearly 300 people were evacuated. Pendleton County, in
northern Kentucky, had more than 100 people evacuated.
   ``I've cried and I've prayed, but I guess the Lord wasn't ready
to answer our prayer,'' said Elma Ruth Troutman of Calhoun, whose
her trailer home was hauled away from rising waters of the Green
River.
   In Frankfort, the Kentucky River was expected to crest at 44
feet, more than 10 feet above flood stage but about 5 feet lower
than the devastating flood of 1978.
   At a Jim Beam distillery in Boston south of Louisville, workers
were brought in by boat Thursday, said Judy Bowman, spokeswoman at
the company's Clermont headquarters.
   ``That's the only way to get in and out,'' she said.
   The plant, which has a flood-control system to keep water out of
the plant, continued to operate at full capacity, she said.
   In Tennessee, Gov. Ned McWherter on Thursday asked the U.S. Small
Business Administration to designate eight Middle Tennessee counties
as flood disaster areas. The request is based on flooding Tuesday in
Wilson County, where damanges were estimated at $1.9 million. Under
federal disaster guidelines, all adjoining counties also become
eligible when a disaster designation is made.
   A report by the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency showed 66
businesses and 28 homes in the Lebanon area sustained flood damage.
All but 14 businesses and nine homes were without flood insurance.
The uninsured loss was estimated at $1.6 million.

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas attacked six
military posts on Thursday, killing at least 12 soldiers and
wounding 14, the military said.
   The fighting between rebels and troops was the first since Jan.
24, when the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said it would
participate in elections if they were delayed six months. The
government said it opposed to the proposal.
   Also Thursday, a former guerrilla commander was fatally shot on a
downtown street in San Salvador, police and government sources said.
His attackers were unknown.
   Slain was Miguel Castellanos, 39, who turned against his comrades
after his capture in 1985 and then worked for the government as an
anti-guerrilla propagandist.
   In 1986, he testified before the Congress that Salvadoran
insurgents received arms shipments from Nicaragua. Castellanos, also
known as Napoleon Romero, was director of the government-affiliated
Center for Studies of the National Reality.
   Police and government sources said on condition of anonymity that
two vehicles carrying assailants intercepted the car in which
Castellanos was traveling near the downtown Flor Blanca soccer
stadium..
   They said Castellanos' car was riddled with scores of bullets
from assault rifles. He was killed instantly and driver and
bodyguard were wounded, the sources said.
   About 60 guerrillas attacked the army base at the Entre Rios
cotton cooperative outside Zacatecoluca with mortar and rifle fire,
said Col. Benjamin Canjura, commander of the Army Engineers
detachment in Zacatecoluca, 22 miles southeast of San Salvador.
   Canjura told a news conference that nine soldiers were killed and
11 wounded during the two-hour attack that began at 2 a.m.
   He said the rebels had many casualties, but he said he could not
provide figures.
   The Marxist-led insurgents also launched four bombs at the
headquarters of the 6th Army brigade in Usulutan, 68 miles east of
San Salvador, Col. Jose Tejada said by telephone.
   They also launched four bombs at the headquarters of the elite
Atonal battalion about a mile from the 6th brigade, he said.
   Three bombs cleared the wall around the headquarters, but did not
explode, he said. The one that fell outside the base exploded beside
a house, wounding two civilians, he said.
   Canjura said rebels also attacked before dawn Civil Defense posts
in Jerusalen, Ostuma and Barrio Nuevo, three small towns in his
central military region.
   He said three soldiers were killed and three wounded in those
attacks.
   Army troops guard warehouses of large coffee, cotton and sugar
cane plantations, which are El Salvador's main foreign exchange
earners. Rebels waging a 9-year-old civil war against the
U.S.-backed government try to destroy the products as part of their
strategy of economic sabotage.
   The guerrillas, in a drastic turnabout, offered last month to
participate in this year's presidential election and respect its
result if the vote were postponed from March 19 to September. The
rebels had boycotted and condemned as sham the five previous
national elections this decade.
   They sharply reduced their offensives while the proposal was
being debated.

   Britain protested to Iran on Thursday over Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's orders to kill Salman Rushdie, the author of ``The
Satanic Verses,'' and religious students in Iran threatened suicide
attacks on him.
   The bounty for killing the writer was doubled to $5.2 million,
and Britain's airlines _ including British Airways _ tightened
security following bomb threats against some flights.
   The death threats against Rushdie, whose book has been denounced
across the Moslem world as blasphemous, were called ``appalling'' by
the U.S. State Department. A leading Islamic theologian who opposes
the book said in Egypt that Khomeini erred by not giving Rushdie a
chance to repent.
   Rushdie, who was born a Moslem in Bombay, India, but no longer
practices Islam, is a naturalized Briton whose novel has sparked
violent protests from Islamic fundamentalists. He has canceled a
promotional tour for the book in the United States and remains in
hiding with his American wife, Marianne Wiggins. Published reports
said they were under police guard in Britain.
   Moslems say the allegorical novel offends their faith by
satirizing the prophet Mohammed as fallible; implying that Islam is
not the only true religion; portraying Mohammed's wives as
prostitutes; and suggesting he wrote the Koran, rather than
receiving it from God.
   The British Foreign Office summoned Iran's lone diplomat in
Britain, told him Khomeini's threat was ``totally unacceptable,''
demanded special protection for its Tehran Embassy, and froze plans
to expand diplomatic relations with the Islamic state.
   ``We recognize that Moslems and others may have strong views
about the contents of Mr. Rushdie's book,'' British Foreign
Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said after his office summoned Iranian
Charge d'Affaires Mohammed Basti.
   ``However, nobody has the right to incite people to violence on
British soil or against British citizens. Ayatollah Khomeini's
statement is totally unacceptable.''
   Howe stopped short of threatening to break diplomatic relations.
But in an address to a Foreign Press Association luncheon he said
``a stable and serious relationship ... will not be possible while
Iran fails to respect international standards of behavior.''
   Basti emerged from the Foreign Office in defiant mood, saying
Rushie's ``infamous book'' has had ``appalling consequences in some
Islamic countries.''
   ``It is a decree, it is a verdict after careful consideration,''
he said of the death sentence. ``It has nothing to do with any
particular country.''
   On Wednesday, protesters stoned the British Embassy in Tehran.
   Britain reopened the embassy in December after an eight-year
closure, and intended to appoint an ambassador and have more than 12
diplomats, the Foreign Office said.
   In New Delhi, an anonymous caller to the United News of India
threatened to bomb British flights unless Rushdie emerged from
hiding.
   At London's Heathrow Airport, British Airways immediately
tightened security with bag-by-bag searches of luggage of passengers
on its Thursday evening flights to the Indian sub-continent and the
Far East.
   Air Europe, another British-owned airline with flights to India,
said it was taking the threat seriously.
   Amid a growing international furor, the Pakistan government
called in the British and American ambassadors and demanded that all
copies of the book be destroyed.
   Pakistan, India and several other countries banned the book.
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto reached agreement with her right-wing
opposition in January on a parliamentary resolution upholding the
ban.
   Tehran Radio said religious figures in the northwestern Iran city
of Urumiyeh said in a statement, ``We have already put on our death
shrouds and pledge to carry out the Imam's (Khomeini's) death
sentence against Salman Rushdie and his publishers in the United
States and Europe.''
   The broadcast followed reports that other death squads were
headed to Britain from Islamic countries in search of Rushdie, a
41-year-old Moslem.
   Rushdie dropped out of sight soon after Khomeini announced the
death sentence on Tuesday on him and Viking, his publishers in
Britain and the United States.
   The $2.6 million bounty offered by Iran was matched by Mohammad
Hashemian, religious leader in the southwestern city of Kerman, who
offered the cash reward ``to any group or individual who carries out
the death sentence on Rushdie and his publishers.'' That brought the
total bounty to $5.2 million.
   Non-Iranians would be paid $1 million if they got to Rushdie
first.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
the United States was ``appalled by the death threats against Salman
Rushdie by the Ayatollah Khomeini, as well as a subsequent offer of
a reward for his murder.''
   ``Such threats are completely irresponsible and are incompatible
with basic standards of international conduct,'' he said, adding
that he did not see how ``this in any way could improve the
prospects'' for U.S.-Iranian relations.
   In the Netherlands, where he is on a NATO tour, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III called the death threats ``regrettable.''
   Sheik Mohammed Hossam-el-Din, a leading Islamic theologian in
Cairo, said Khomeini erred in sending death squads after Rushdie
because executing him would be ``virtually impossible'' under the
tenets of Islam.
   Hossam-el-Din said in an interview that nobody has been executed
in Islam's 1,350-year history as an apostate, which he interpreted
as the crime that Khomeini invoked in issuing his sentence against
Rushdie. Khomeini said only that the Indian-born author deserved to
die for insulting Islam.
   In other developments:
   _ The French government said it was ``shocked'' at the death
threat and Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek canceled a trip
to Tehran.
   _ Italian publishers Arnoldo Mondadori Editore Spa said they
would go head with a contract to release the Italian edition of
``The Satanic Verses,'' but Rushdie's French publishers, Christian
Bourgois, suspended publication plans.
   _ The British Arts Council, backing earlier protests by British
writers, denounced the threats against Rushdie and his publishers as
contrary to the ``tolerance and understanding that are the hallmark
of a free society.''

   A Japanese balloonist was drifting more slowly than
planned early Friday because of a shifting jet stream that could
whisk him toward Alaska instead of his planned destination of
California, a spokesman said.
   Three days after he set off to become the first solo balloonist
to cross the Pacific Ocean, Fumio Niwa floated east near Torishima
Island, about 1,250 miles southeast of Tokyo, at 9:30 a.m., said
spokesman Naoto Higashi.
   Niwa was floating in his orange-and-blue helium balloon over the
Pacific Ocean at about 35 mph at the south edge of a jet stream,
slower than he had hoped, Higashi said.
   Another spokesman, Hiroaki Tanaka, said the jet stream can carry
him at about 125 mph, but Niwa decided not to enter it fully because
it was angling toward Alaska.
   Originally, Niwa had planned to rise immediately to 26,400 feet
and enter the jet stream, which he calculated would have blown him
the 5,000-mile distance to San Diego in four days.
   Niwa rose to 23,100 feet on Friday, from 15,100 feet on Thursday
night, Tanaka said.
   Despite delays due to slight changes in the angle of the jet
stream, Higashi said Niwa still expected to reach his target by
about Feb. 20. Niwa has supplies for 10 days.
   The 38-year-old balloonist lifted off from Yokohama, southwest of
Tokyo, early Wednesday in a spherical plastic gondola six feet wide
that he had designed himself.
   The capsule is pressurized but has no navigational or heating
equipment. Niwa relies on amateur radio reports based on radio
beacon signals to pinpoint his location.
   The temperature inside the gondola Friday morning was 23 degrees,
and it was minus 13 outside, said Tanaka. Battery-powered electric
coils in Niwa's flight suit keep him warm.
   Niwa quit his job with a computer firm three months ago to
prepare for the flight. He said he planned to sleep during the day
and stay awake at night.
   In 1981, four men reached the United States from Japan by balloon
for the first time, but no one has traveled the distance alone.
   Niwa, who has 1,000 hours of ballooning experience, estimated the
flight would cost about $540,000, which he hopes to regain through a
book and lectures about his experience.

   Arctic air settled into the north-central states Thursday,
bringing freezing temperatures and producing record high-pressure
readings across parts of the upper Midwest.
   Barometric readings of 30.98 inches at Chicago, 31 inches at
Milwaukee and 31.05 inches at Duluth, Minn., established all-time
records for those locations.
   Freezing temperatures extended from the northern High Plains
through the upper half of the Mississippi Valley to northern New
England on Thursday afternoon. Readings were below zero across much
of Montana, North Dakota and northern Minnesota, and close to 20
degrees below zero in northwestern North Dakota.
   Snow extended from eastern Washington state through Montana into
western North Dakota, prompting storm warnings in south-central
Washington and northwest and west-central Montana.
   Snow also fell in northeastern Washington, Oregon's mountains,
Wyoming's northwest mountains and much of Idaho. Rain fell in
western Oregon and western Washington.
   Light rain and drizzle extended from the southern High Plains
across the Tennessee Valley and the middle Atlantic Coast, with
heavier showers bringing a flash-flood watch in parts of southern
Texas.
   An advisory for freezing rain was in effect Thursday night for
Texas' southern plains.
   Rainfall totals for the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST included .87
inches at Astoria, Ore., .69 inches at Killeen, Texas, and .60
inches at Carlsbad, N.M.
   Unseasonably warm weather continued in the Southeast. Record high
temperatures for the date included 82 in Augusta, Ga.; 80 in
Columbus, Ga.; 83 in Macon, Ga.; 86 in Savannah, Ga.; and 87 in
Charleston, S.C., which had the nation's high temperature.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 11
degrees below zero at Minot, N.D., to 85 degrees at Charleston,
S.C., and Savannah, Ga. The low for the nation Thursday morning was
37 degrees below zero at Hibbing, Minn.
   The forecast for Friday was snow from west of the central Rockies
across the northern half of the Great Plains to the upper Great
Lakes region and the northern Ohio Valley. Rain was expected along
the northern and central Pacific coast and from the southern Plains
through much of the lower Mississippi Valley to the Carolinas and
the middle Atlantic Coast states.
   Freezing temperatures were predicted through the day from eastern
Washington through the northern and central High Plains to New
England, with below-zero readings across Montana and eastern North
Dakota. Temperatures should be above 50 degrees from the California
coast through southern Texas to the southern Atlantic coast, with
highs in the 70s in southern California and southern Arizona.
Temperatures were expected to reach into the 70s from southern
Louisiana to southern Georgia and northern Florida and 80s across
the Florida peninsula.

   Contra rebels will not lay down their
weapons until Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government institutes
the democratic reforms it pledged at the Central American summit, a
rebel leader said Thursday.
   Wilfredo Montalvan, a director of the Contra organization known
as the Nicaraguan Resistance, told a news conference in San Jose the
rebels will wait four months to see if the Sandinistas carry out the
election reforms they promised.
   Otherwise, he said, they will renew their war against the
Sandinistas and ``we will seek military aid to do it, and we will
ask for it anywhere we can,'' Montalvan said. The United States
supported the Contras with weapons and training for six years until
February 1988, when Congress banned the aid.
   In Nicaragua, Sandinista officials said the Contras killed five
people in attacks this week, including a Sandinista army lieutenant.
   The government said the lieutenant, a woman and two boys were
killed in a machine-gun attack Wednesday on a home in El Guasimon,
120 miles northeast of the capital, Managua.
   Rebels also killed a Protestant minister during attacks in
northeast Nicaragua on Wednesday night, Sandinista officials said.
   At the end of a two-day regional summit in El Salvador on
Tuesday, President Daniel Ortega announced that Nicaragua will hold
early elections, permit the opposition to campaign and allow
observers from the United Nations to watch the polling.
   The presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica
announced they would devise a plan within 90 days to dismantle the
rebel force, especially Contra supply and training camps in Honduras
along the Nicaraguan border.
   At the summit, it was clear from comments by Sandinista aides
that Ortega expects the Contras will be disbanded before the
Sandinistas have to undertake any of their promised reforms. Ortega
said the reforms would begin several months before the February 1990
elections.
   Montalvan said he was ``satisfied'' with Ortega's announcement
advancing the election date by 10 months to February 1990, but he
said the Nicaraguan Resistance will be watching to see what concrete
reforms the Sandinistas undertake before disarming.
   ``We will not surrender a single rifle unless there is total
democracy in Nicaragua,'' he said. ``We are willing to surrender our
weapons, but only in exchange for democracy. We are lovers of peace,
and if we are in rebellion it's because they have denied us freedom
and human rights.''
   Montalvan said the Sandinistas should undertake the election
reforms ``immediately in order to generate confidence in the peace
process,'' under a plan devised by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
in 1987 for which he was awarded that year's Nobel Peace Prize.
   The plan, and accompanying peace accords the five presidents
signed in Guatemala at the time, sought a negotiated end to
Nicaragua's Contra war, a nine-year leftist guerrilla war in El
Salvador and a decades-old leftist insurrection in Guatemala.
   After a flurry of talks between rebels and government
representatives in the three countries, only the Contras and
Sandinistas achieved a frail cease-fire last April. There has been
no agreement on peace, mostly because of the Sandinistas' insistence
that the rebels surrender before political reforms are undertaken.

<HEAD>Deaths of Two Koreans Spark Anti-American Protests in Kunsan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two apparently unrelated deaths of
Korean citizens near a U.S. air base in the provincial city of Kusan
led to violent anti-American protests, police and U.S. officials
said Friday.
   Radical students demanding punishment for U.S. servicemen
involved in the deaths held rallies and clashed with riot police
this week, witnesses said.
   U.S. and South Korean authorities are investigating the two
deaths in Kunsan, a port city about 130 miles southwest of Seoul.
   U.S. officials said the incidents were apparently unrelated.
   They said all military personnel at Kunsan Air Base now were
restricted to the base.
   The first death was that of a mushroom grower identified as Chong
Pan-yong, 54, who died Saturday after an altercation in a
residential area of the city.
   Tech. Sgt. Bruce A. Harayda, 29, of Bridgeport, Conn., stationed
at Osan Air Base with the 51st Tactical Fighter Wing, was released
in that case in the custody of Kunsan Air Base authorities, U.S.
officials said. He was visiting Kunsan at the time on the incident.
   On Wednesday, a military vehicle driven by Spec. Dale J. Green of
the 501st Signal Co. struck and killed Song Yun-jae, 36. Green is
based at Kunsan.
   Pvt. Maurice A. Ferrell, also of the 501st, was a passenger in
the vehicle at the time. U.S. officials said the accident occurred
on a city street near a local university.
   U.S. military authorities are holding the two soldiers until
investigations are completed, officials said. Their hometowns were
not available.
   Student sources, reached by telephone in Kunsan, said about 500
students yelling anti-American slogans held a rally Wednesday and
clashed with police in downtown streets for almost three hours until
they were dispersed by tear gas.
   The sources said on condition of anonymity that a rally also was
held Thursday to demand South Korean police punish the U.S. soldiers
involved in the two deaths and that Washington pay compensation to
the families.
   Also Thursday, up to 300 radical students screaming ``Oppose
Bush's visit!'' attacked a U.S. cultural center in downtown Kwangju
with firebombs and steel pipes, and at least six policemen were
hurt, officials said.
   Kwangju lies 180 miles southwest of Seoul, the capital. The
cultural center is favorite target of radicals, who have attacked it
28 times since 1980.
   President Bush is to stop over in South Korea on Feb. 27 on his
way home after attending Emperor Hirohito's funeral in Japan and
visiting China.
   The U.S. Embassy in Seoul said some furniture and fixtures
suffered fire damage in the attack.

   New allegations of ``troublesome''
indiscretions by Defense Secretary-designate John Tower arose
Thursday, and the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman raised
the possibility that the Senate may hold a rare closed session to
grapple with questions about Tower's personal life.
   Former arms control chief Kenneth L. Adelman said Tower's
personal conduct when he served as a U.S. negotiator in Geneva
created problems for the State Department. He said Tower's actions,
which he declined to specify, raised questions about his judgment
and integrity.
   Meantime, the latest FBI report into Tower's background has not
uncovered any evidence linking him to the Pentagon weapons-buying
scandal or illegal campaign contributions, The Washington Post
reported in its Friday editions.
   But the newspaper, quoting unnamed sources, said the report
contains new details about Tower's personal life. The volume of
information about his drinking habits and relations with women is so
great he probably wouldn't be hired as an FBI agent, the newspaper
said.
   The report will be sent to the Armed Services Committee on
Monday, the newspaper said.
   From January 1985 to April 1986, Tower headed the department's
delegation that discussed mutual cuts in long-range nuclear missiles
with the Soviets.
   Tower's private behavior didn't directly affect his conduct of
official business at the Geneva talks, Adelman said. Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the armed services panel, has said an
investigation of Tower's actions in Geneva found no security
breaches.
   But Adelman said Tower's conduct should be a factor in the Senate
confirmation deliberations because ``a defense secretary has no
private life.'' Adelman spoke in an Los Angeles Times interview
published Thursday and in a Washington Times column on Wednesday.
   Adelman said he was impressed with Tower's performance as a
strategic arms negotiator, ``Yet his lack of discretion proved
troublesome then, as before and since.''
   Tower has been dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing,
and many senators also have voiced concern whether Tower could avoid
conflicts of interest after receiving more than $1 million as a
consultant for major defense contractors since he left the Senate
four years ago.
   Nunn, at a Georgia appearance Thursday, said he hopes his
committee can vote on Tower's nomination next week. He said the
``delay now is waiting on the FBI to check out an allegation that
came from the Justice Department.''
   The FBI is known to be investigating new allegations that Nunn
has said are of a financial nature. Other senators have said they
are related to the Pentagon's massive contract fraud case.
   Nunn said that if the committee were to vote today, ``I think
most people on the committee haven't decided because we have not got
all the information.''
   Nunn said that if questions arise from members of the Senate
regarding Tower's personal life, the Senate may be forced to meet
behind closed doors.
   ``I hope not, but it depends on the type of questions posed on
the Senate floor by senators who are not members of the Senate Armed
Services Committee,'' Nunn told reporters Wednesday during a visit
to Rome, Ga.
   ``If an accurate answer to these questions include personal
information, I would recommend that a limited closed session be held
to answer these questions and only these questions,'' he said. ``I
emphasize that the leadership of the Senate will make this decision,
not the Armed Services Committee or its chairman.''
   Meanwhile, a prominent Republican senators said he doubted that
the Senate will confirm Bush's nominee. Sen. David Durenberger,
R-Minn., said Tower's past associations with defense contractors
would cast a shadow over his decision-making at the Pentagon.
   ``I think he'd be haunted by that, every decision he'd try to
make, which doesn't make him a bad defense secretary, because he
probably is the kind of tough guy we need,'' Durenberger said in
Minneapolis.
   But Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he expects Tower to win
Senate approval and added: ``He's a tough little dog, I tell you,
and he's going to get into that Defense Department and he's going to
think that his reputation needs a lot of repair, and it does, and I
think he's going to do some pretty good work. He's going to shake
those folks up and they need to be shaken up in the department.,''
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., in an appearance at the University of
Arkansas in Little Rock, said Tower has ``really become his own
worst enemy'' and predicted that he will not be confirmed.
   ``The Department of Defense has enough problems today without the
secretary of defense bringing in his own problems,'' Pryor said.
   Nunn has said he will reserve judgment on the Tower nomination
until the committee receives the final FBI report, expected sometime
next week. A committee vote is possible next week when the Senate
returns from its recess.
   A closed session of the full Senate is highly unusual, occurring
on average about once a year and usually relating to national
security issues.
   The last closed session occurred on March 29, 1988, when the
Senate met to discuss the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty
with the Soviet Union.
   In 1986, the Senate held a closed session during the impeachment
proceedings of Judge Harry E. Claiborne.
   Closed sessions were held in 1984 on Nicaragua, in 1983 on two
State Department nominations and in 1982 on U.S.-Soviet defense
issues. In 1980, the Senate met behind closed doors on military
readiness.

   President Daniel Ortega dismissed
claims that his promise to hold free elections is insincere, telling
the nation he can now promote democracy because the Sandinistas are
strong and backed by the people.
   In a televised speech Wednesday night, Ortega also hinted that he
might run for re-election.
   At the end of a regional summit Tuesday in El Salvador, he
promised to hold presidential, legislative and municipal elections
by next February and to allow the opposition help organize them.
   The summit agreement signed by five Central American presidents
also calls for disbanding of the Contra guerrillas, most of whom are
encamped in neighboring Honduras.

   The four top candidates for the Justice
Department's chief civil rights job all would sharply change the
controversial policies that William Bradford Reynolds followed for
the last eight years.
   A leading candidate is Evan Kemp Jr., a disabled-rights advocate
who publicly battled Reynolds over a proposal to reduce
anti-discrimination protection for handicapped people.
   Kemp, a member of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, is
being considered for the post of assistant attorney general in
charge of the Justice Department's civil rights division, said
administration sources.
   Confined to a wheelchair, Kemp has been an advocate for
handicapped Americans and once successfully sued the Securities and
Exchange Commission after being told his disability would bar his
promotion to supervisor.

   A jury awarded Rock Hudson's lover $14.5
million _ $3.5 million more than he sought _ in a case that appears
to increase the legal responsibility of AIDS sufferers to tell
sexual companions of their plight.
   In what one expert called a landmark decision, the jury declared
Wednesday that Hudson engaged in ``outrageous conduct'' before his
death by withholding his AIDS diagnosis from Marc Christian so he
could continue their sexual affair.
   The settlement could go still higher. Jurors were scheduled to
return today to hear evidence and consider punitive damages against
Mark Miller, Hudson's secretary, who was found to have conspired to
keep the late actor's AIDS diagnosis a secret.
   Hudson's estate and Miller were co-defendants in the seven-week
trial in Los Angeles Superior Court, where jurors listened to
often-lurid testimony about the late star's sex life before deciding
in favor of Christian, 35.

   Movie studios began boasting today
about their Oscar nominations, which included a torrent for ``Rain

   ``Rain Man'' received eight nominations Wednesday and Miss Weaver
earned two in Academy Award selections that also were notable for
some prominent omissions.
   All five of the best picture nominees came at years' end. Despite
a heavy campaign to remind Academy voters, the early release ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being'' bagged no major prize, nor did
``Bull Durham,'' ``Dead Ringers'' or Clint Eastwood's ``Bird.''
   Yet the voters did remember James Edward Olmos' courageous school
teacher in ``Stand and Deliver,'' released well over a year ago.

   A member of the board that regulates the
savings and loan industry has not sold his stock in a family
business despite a sworn pledge to the Senate and a legal
requirement that he do so.
   The Associated Press learned that Roger Martin continues to hold
a 29 percent share in Pope Scientific Inc., a Menomonee Falls, Wis.,
company that makes laboratory glassware. Martin has valued his share
of the company at $100,000 to $250,000.
   Martin, a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and other
employees of the agency blame a paperwork jam and confusing rules
for his failure to sell his stock or be relieved of his promise.
   The bank board oversees the operation of more than 3,000 savings
and loan institutions, regulating their transactions and auditing
their records.

   Americans are increasingly going to nursing homes
to die as hospitals discharge terminally ill patients to keep them
from running up big bills, thus helping reduce the nation's Medicare
costs, according to two reports today.
   One study, based on nationwide death statistics, suggests that
the trend results largely from new Medicare rules that pay hospitals
flat fees for taking care of the elderly. This approach gives them a
financial incentive to keep patients' hospital stays as short as
possible.
   ``What has to be said is that hospitals are in a bind because
they are being pressured by cost cutting,'' said Dr. Mark A. Sager,
who directed the study. ``Nursing homes are in a bind because nobody
wants to pay for nursing home care. Patients are in a bind because
they are in a system that does not want to provide continuity of
care and health care financing is fragmented.''
   His research showed that the number of elderly Americans dying in
nursing homes rose sharply during the 1980s, while fewer died in
hospitals.

   President Kennedy's moderate response
during the Cuban missile crisis was perceived instead as ``a virtual
declaration of war'' by the Soviets, and Premier Nikita Khruschev
backed down from the brink for unexpected reasons, scholars now say.
   Newly declassified documents indicate that luck, as well as
skill, played a great role in resolving the world's last major
nuclear crisis 27 years ago, Soviet and American experts at Harvard
University said Wednesday.
   Kennedy and Khrushchev made key decisions based on serious
misperceptions and faulty intelligence, which, however, may have
helped to resolve the crisis as well as to start it, said Graham T.
Allison, dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
   ``Looking at it in retrospect, with all the new information, I
still give high marks to President Kennedy and ... also, perhaps
surprisingly, to Khrushchev, for the degree of control they tried to
exercise,'' said Allison, author of ``Essence of Decision,'' one of
the authoritative books on the crisis.

   Those ubiquitous ``economic observers'' whose
views are cited so often don't know whether to cheer or worry these
days. The economy has become that confusing.
   The reason: economic growth, normally the most sought-after goal
of policy-makers, has become a cause of concern. Too much growth is
bad. You can take Alan Greenspan's word for it.
   Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has stated and
restated his view that the six-year-old expansion is headed toward
inflation _ which often precede recessions _ unless growth is
harnessed.
   In a nutshell, his rationale is contained in a statement made
last summer to the Senate Banking Committee, to wit:
   ``Considering the already limited slack in available labor and
capital resources, a leveling of the unemployment and capacity
utilization rates is essential if more intense inflationary
pressures are to be avoided in the period ahead.''
   Ever since, he has been putting upward pressure on interest
rates, the better to slow growth.
   It creates a perplexing situation for ordinary folks to
understand. There are even hints from time to time that President
Bush may be among the perplexed.
   More than once the president has stated that he and Greenspan
aren't far apart in their approaches to the economy. But then the
president has stated that he isn't nearly as concerned about
inflation as Greenspan is.
   At most times, 4 percent economic growth would be reason to
cheer. So would a sharp decline in unemployment, a rise in the rate
at which the nation's factories are utilized, higher retail sales,
consumer confidence _ and more.
   To some extent, these and other factors are still described as
evidences of health, strength and vigor. But the descriptions are
barely uttered when the caveats follow. Typical: ``Of course, the
threat of inflation. ...''
   For most Americans it is difficult to believe that growth is bad,
since economic growth has been a continuing theme of the country's
history. Moreover, isn't growth needed in order for America to meet
foreign competition?
   Yes. But Greenspan and like-thinkers say a nation's capacity to
produce is limited by the manpower, money and machines at its
disposal. As they see it, we are now straining all three resources.
   When that happens the economy begins to smoke. It becomes
stressed, less productive, because it must rely on less efficient
manpower and plants. Rather than producing goods and services, the
economy manufactures higher prices.
   Not everyone agrees with the slow-growth theme, and notable among
them is Edward Yardeni, economics director at Prudential-Bache
Securities. Yardeni is so outspoken that a year from now he will be
either hero or bum.
   ``We think growth is good,'' he stated in a recent newsletter.
``We believe (Greenspan) is exaggerating the inflationary risks.''
   Moreover, Yardeni contends, much of recent economic activity has
been in the expansion of capital goods, which expand domestic
capacity and boost exports. To Yardeni, this is a critical
consideration. He explains:
   ``If Mr. Greenspan turns the screws too tight, he could snuff out
the capital spending boom we need to expand the capacity that he
fears there isn't enough of.''
   Of course, Yardeni says, it is true that tight monetary policy
can increase slack by depressing economic demand. But his approach
is the opposite: ``We prefer policies that create slack by letting
capacity grow.''
   Ah, there's the problem to which the answer is so elusive. Is
growth good or bad? Do we slow down or do we speed up? Do we cheer
or do we worry?

<HEAD>`Passion and Paradise' Lacks Both</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Well, we're all just so pleased that the cast and
crew of ABC's ``Passion and Paradise'' got to do part of the winter
filming in Jamaica.
   That seems to be the best result of this two-part movie, no doubt
named ``Passion and Paradise'' because such a title will draw more
viewers than the more apt ``Tedium and Purgatory.''
   Was it only a week ago that we were hailing the triumph of
quality in ``Lonesome Dove?'' Back to reality, folks.
   This is a mostly muddled attempt to make a suspense yarn out of
the real-life 1943 murder of Sir Harry Oakes, a fabulously wealthy
American miner who traded gold for British title and a plantation in
the Bahamas. Oakes' murder was never solved, though it likely was
linked to his opposition to legalized gambling on the islands, a
development sorely desired by organized crime.
   The movie, which airs Sunday and Tuesday, sports a rather bizarre
cast. Yes, Rod Steiger and Mariette Hartley _ together at last!
   Steiger and Hartley are actually not bad as Oakes and his wife,
saddled as they are with a lurching script that provides ample
opportunity for great fits of overacting. Steiger, playing the
doomed Sir Harry, manages to last through the first installment.
   In the second, Hartley shrieks at one point, ``Kill me! Kill me
now!'' This seems to be part of the dialogue and not a spontaneous
plea to be released from the proceedings.
   Armand Assante, looking like Napoleon in exile, seems to be
making a career out of slouching through overwrought network
miniseries. He plays Alfred De Marigny, a count-slash-chicken-farmer
who casts aside his history of fortune-hunting to woo and win Sir
Harry's winsome _ and very rich _ daughter, Nancy. She is played
with fretful consternation by Catherine Mary Stewart, whose reaction
to tragedy seems remarkably similar to observing a run in one's
stocking. When Nancy discovers that Alfred has a wife, she
complains, ``Do you know what this makes me feel like?'' A new
agent, perhaps?
   Oakes is bludgeoned and burned in what appeared to be a voodoo
ceremony _ there was an uprising among native workers at the time.
The rest of the movie is taken up with Alfred's mind-numbing murder
trial, interspersed with scenes that attempt to portray everyone
else as still a suspect. This is the writing-directing equivalent of
trying to keep several plates spinning at one time.
   But mystery turns to melodrama. The villains _ Mafia stereotypes
partnered with snooty Britons _ have all the subtly of a herd of
Snidely Whiplashes. Michael Sarrazin does, however, do an admirably
oily job of playing the gangsters' evil emissary to the islands.
   It seems the gangsters are in cahoots with the Duke and Duchess
of Windsor (Andrew Ray and Linda Griffiths), a dastardly and
enormously amusing pair.
   The duke was governor of the Bahamas during World War II. ``I
want that casino,'' the duchess pouts to the duke. ``If I can't be
queen of England, I'll make my own kingdom here.''
   ``Why can't it be like the old days between us?'' he whines.
   ``It can be,'' she purrs. ``You'll think of something, won't
you?'' and plants a wet one on him in case he doesn't get the
picture.
   Late in the movie _ if you last this long, please consult a
physician _ there's an entirely new twist when Wayne Rogers arrives
impersonating Columbo, or in this case cheerfully frumpy private eye
Raymond Schindler, whom Nancy has brought from the States to help
prove Alfred's innocence.
   Since we know the case was never solved, we know the outcome of
the trial. But that's not the end of the movie. Schindler ensconces
himself on a sofa to propound his own cockamamie theory about what
really happened to Oakes.
   In a surprise ending it turns out there was really no reason to
make a movie about the whole messy business at all.

<HEAD>Too Little Capacity Might Become Too Much</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A very tricky matter is developing for monetary
officials, meaning those who have an input into Federal Reserve
money policies, and it will take luck as well as wisdom to deal with
it.
   It is odd as well as tricky: The potential solution is part of
the problem. It means that in order to deal with the problem,
officials might be forced to delay the solution.
   The problem involves an inflation threat. The hard fact is that
the economy is approaching the limits of its capacity. When that
point is reached, prices might rise sharply. Demand will exceed the
ability to produce.
   The Fed announced this week that in December and January the
operating rate of industry was 84.4 percent, figures that have not
been surpassed since October 1979. In the past, figures higher than
that led to rising prices.
   One way to deal with such a problem is to slow the economy, thus
keeping demand within capacity. The Fed has been trying to do that,
pressuring interest rates higher almost month by month since last
summer.
   Based on experience, high interest rates eventually will produce
the slack that is sought by the Fed. But it might do something more:
It might very well force industry to forgo efforts to expand its
capacity to meet the demand.
   Capacity is expanded in several ways _ by building new plants,
expanding manufacturing space, adding more efficient equipment and
instituting various other procedures that permit greater
efficiencies.
   That process is now going full blast, but a serious question
arises: Will rising interest rates snuff it out?
   Evidence of the capital outlays boom are contained in a
just-released analysis from the National Federation of Independent
Business, which surveys its membership every three months on a
variety of economic matters.
   The latest survey shows that plans for capital outlays jumped to
36 percent of all the federation's 500,000 business members, the
highest percentage since questions on the subject became part of the
survey in 1977.
   Economist William Dunkelberg, who designed the study and
interprets results every quarter, said the findings suggest ``the
underlying strength of capital spending in the economy is still not
reflected in official statistics.''
   The study found that 57 percent of the companies _ made up of
enterprises ranging in size from proprietorships to those with sales
in the hundreds of millions of dollars _ have made capital outlays
in the past six months.
   He observes that major additions to production capacity are being
made in a broad range of industries, that major electricity
generating plans are in the pipeline, and that business construction
of all types remains strong.
   In short, U.S. industry is making a massive attempt to enlarge
capacity to meet the stress of demand.
   Can it succeed, or will it take too long to build enough capacity
before inflation gets out of hand? More importantly, can industry
continue to build capacity if interest rates continue to rise?
   While nobody, not even profound Federal Reserve minds, can answer
with any certainty, a bit of encouragement is contained in the NFIB
report. It shows that with profits strong, many companies are able
to finance internally.
   If the economy slows, however, and especially if it dips into
recession, those profits might not be sufficient to the task.
   Dunkelberg says costly money already is discouraging some
borrowing. And, he says, since 48 percent of member short-term loans
are tied to the prime rate, many companies are ``exposed'' to any
slowdown attempts by the Fed.

<HEAD>The Bard's The Thing On The British Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bard's the thing on the London stage these
days, with a stream of productions to compete with the Royal
Shakespeare Company and a renewed confidence in Shakespeare's
selling power.
   Shakespeare has been the obvious mainstay of the
government-subsidized RSC since it was founded by Sir Peter Hall in
1960. In 1989-90, the Company will mount more Shakespeare than ever
_ 14 out of a total of 27 productions.
   But what has changed is the amount of Shakespeare available
elsewhere.
   Last season, the newly formed Renaissance Theater Company mounted
a sell-out 10-week run of three Shakespeare plays at the West End's
Phoenix Theater, winning plaudits for actor-manager Kenneth
Branagh's vivacity plus a new audience for the Bard.
   The Phoenix is now playing host to Derek Jacobi _ who directed
the Renaissance production of ``Hamlet'' _ in the title roles of
both ``Richard II'' and ``Richard III.''
   Alan Bates and Felicity Kendal open early in April in a West End
staging of ``Much Ado About Nothing'' in repertory with Anton
Chekhov's ``Ivanov.'' Dustin Hoffman follows in June, making his
London stage debut as Shylock in ``The Merchant of Venice.''
   In the fall, Michael Gambon who starred in TV's ``Singing
Detective,'' will play Othello, with playwright Alan Ayckbourn
directing.
   And the English Shakespeare Company is staging a seven-play cycle
of history plays at the Old Vic under the collective title ``The
Wars of the Roses.''
   ``The Shakespeare boom continues, and is challenging the RSC's
historic leadership,'' wrote Michael Ratcliffe in The Observer in an
article headlined ``Will-power shakes up the scene.''
   This theatrical landscape recalls the pre-subsidy 1940s and '50s,
when acting greats such as John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Peggy
Ashcroft regularly performed the Bard on the West End.
   On Broadway, by contrast, Shakespeare works are rare, and only
two productions in the past decade have made money: the James Earl
Jones-Christopher Plummer ``Othello''; and the Derek Jacobi ``Much
Ado About Nothing,'' an RSC import.
   Alan Bates, who is associated in the theater with the modern
plays of Simon Gray, calls the return to classics ``very healthy. It
is also very brave, but there does seem to be an audience for it.''
   Michael Pennington, the 48-year-old actor heading ``The Wars of
the Roses'' cycle, said he finds the trend very heartening.
   A former RSC regular, Pennington and director Michael Bogdanov
started their company in November 1986 to reinvigorate the Bard's
plays outside the institutional confines of London's large
subsidized companies.
   Pennington took the English Shakespeare Company to Japan,
Australia and the United States and returned to find that the
company's ``Richard III'' is one of three on view in London this
season.
   His fears the British might be glutted on Shakespeare have proved
unfounded.
   ``We were concerned the audience was going to be split because a
small minority go to Shakespeare, let alone unpopular Shakespeare,''
said Pennington, referring particularly to the rarely performed
``Henry VI'' history plays, a trilogy which the ESC has compressed
into two plays.
   Instead, he said, ``we may have provoked something. Shakespeare
is good box office.''
   The RSC is staging much of the same cycle this season under the
title ``The Plantagenets,'' which conflates the three ``Henry VI''
plays and ``Richard III'' into a nine-hour marathon event opening
April 1.
   ``There's obviously an energy abroad which is thrilling,'' said
RSC associate director Adrian Noble. ``The proof is in the pudding:
I have a feeling the experience each one offers is so different.''
   He thinks the rekindled interest in Shakespeare may be a reaction
to contemporary political drama, which is often shrill and
constricted where Shakespeare is full of scope for new
interpretation.
   Noble directed the RSC in a highly praised 1984 production of
``Henry V,'' turning it into an anti-war statement against Britain's
war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands two years earlier.
   ``The strong didactic viewpoint of the '60s and '70s is a thing
of the past,'' he said. ``There's actually a very strong thirst for
non-editorialized political drama: Our lives are full of
contradiction, and these are complex, contradictory plays.''
   The RSC survives on its subsidy, and the ESC on sponsorship by
Allied Irish Bank. But both the Jacobi double-bill and the Bates
``Much Ado'' are straightforward commercial ventures of London's
Triumph Theater Productions Ltd. They are being presented in a
financial climate that favors smaller casts and less elaborate
scenery.
   ``It's like a small-scale musical with attendant costs,'' Peter
Wilkins, Triumph's deputy managing director, said of the two
``Richard'' plays, which are expected to go to Washington and
Broadway next year.
   While refusing to give exact figures, Wilkins said costs ran
three times as high as, say, the two-character ``A Walk in the
Woods'' with Alec Guinness, a Triumph production whose 150,000-pound
($260,000) budget roughly equals the average London budget for a
straight play.
   But he said Jacobi's presence made the risks worthwhile. ``When
you have a star like Derek who has assumed the mantle of John
Gielgud, that justifies it.''

<TEXT>
   Isabella Rossellini's film career has included
mostly off-beat movies, notably David Lynch's underground classic,
``Blue Velvet,'' Norman Mailer's ``Tough Guys Don't Dance'' and the
sleeper hit, ``Siesta.''
   But in ``Cousins,'' the American remake of the popular French
film, ``Cousin, Cousine,'' Rossellini plays a woman torn between the
love of two men, the kind of part that was a specialty of her
mother, Ingrid Bergman.
   Fans of ``Casablanca,'' who agonized over whether Bergman would
end up with Humphrey Bogart, the man she loved, or her husband, Paul
Henreid, to whom she felt responsible, can see Rossellini forced to
make a similar decision in ``Cousins.''
   ``I do what I like,'' the actress said in a recent interview.
``If a commercial film comes about that I like, I love to do it. I
have a different reason why I want to do each film.''
   She plays Maria Hardy, who ends up falling in love with Larry
Kozinski (Ted Danson) after her husband (William Petersen) has an
affair with Kozinski's wife (Sean Young).
   Rossellini's participation in the film, which also stars Lloyd
Bridges and the Argentine actress, Norma Aleandro, came about by
accident. She had originally been asked to look at the script as a
favor to friends who were putting the film together.
   ``There was a kind of a warmth and nice feeling to it,'' she
said. ``I was a little bit bashful. I didn't know what I was going
to do. I told them I read the script and I really like it. But I
would like to do it.''
   The cast of ``Cousins'' comes from a wide range of backgrounds.
Danson had starred in the hit TV sit-com ``Cheers.'' Petersen worked
in the theater. Young pursued a dancing career before making her
film debut at age 19. Aleandro had appeared on stage, screen and
television and had won acclaim and honors for her part in ``The
Official Story.'' Rossellini brought her experience as a model and
journalist.
   ``The ability to keep in character is the same thing that happens
when you model _ not being thrown off and getting nervous and tense
about having a lot of people around you.''
   Modeling also helped Rossellini become sensitive to the
importance of wardrobe.
   ``The way you dress shows a little the way your character is. I
love talking with the designers about my character. I think I am
trained to see the different ways people dress.''
   Rossellini and her twin sister, Ingrid, were born in 1952, the
children of Bergman and Italian director Roberto Rossellini, whose
affair in the late 1940s shocked the film world and led to Bergman's
estrangement from Hollywood for many years.
   With her mother one of the world's most famous actresses and her
father a major director, Rossellini was reluctant to get involved in
filmmaking.
   ``I guess I never dared. I thought it was kind of presumptous,''
said Rossellini, who has been married twice, to director Martin
Scorcese and model Jon Wiedemann. ``My father wanted me to finish
school. They always felt being an actress would be difficult and
they were right!''
   So at age 20 she worked as a translator for Italian television
and eventually spent three years conducting interviews for the
Italian comedy series, ``The Other Sunday.''
   ``That was rewarding. The fact that I was able to become
successful made me more secure about myself and helped me become an
actress. I think if I would have started at 18, I would have been
devastated. I was little more together when I started at 30-31,''
she said.
   Her modeling career started in 1980 when she agreed to have her
picture taken by photographer Bruce Weber and ended up on the cover
of Vogue magazine. She appeared in a few minor films, ``The Meadow''
and ``Il Papocchio,'' and became popular with American audiences in
1984 playing Gregory Hines' Russian-born wife in ``White Nights.''
   But Rossellini wasn't adverse to stepping out of the mainstream.
In 1986, she played Dennis Hopper's abused wife in ``Blue Velvet,''
one of the strangest and most critically acclaimed films of the year.
   ``It was very original, very rich,'' she said. ``I had imagined
it like this. It was all in the script. The atmosphere on the set
was very warm and very friendly. People think it must have been very
unpleasant to play it, but the atmosphere was just the opposite. I
don't think I could have played the scenes otherwise.''
   What also mattered to Rossellini was the ability to relate to her
character.
   ``It's essential. How do you portray someone you don't like? Even
when I read a script, I kind of have to fall in love with my
character. Love is the basis of an inspiration, of creativity. You
spend hours and hours trying to figure it out. If there isn't love,
nothing comes to your mind.''

   The Rev. Kan Xueqing says his prayers have been
answered. One of his flock, George Bush, has been elected president
of the United States.
   ``God has his own plan,'' said Kan, as he sat smiling in an
antechamber of his church in a bustling section of Beijing. ``He
arranges things in wondrous ways.''
   Bush's former tennis coach Wang Huailong says he'd love to get a
game in with the president when he comes to China Feb. 25-27, after
the funeral of Emperor Hirohito in Tokyo, but his old tennis partner
will probably be too busy.
   ``I'd like to see whether his backhand has improved,'' said Wang,
wearing a Japanese track suit at Beijing's International Club. ``He
never beat me in singles so I'd like to give him another shot.''
   Bush and his wife Barbara lived in China from September 1974 to
October 1975 when he headed the U.S. Liaison Office set up in the
early days of U.S.-Chinese rapprochement that resulted in full
diplomatic relations in 1979. Bush became chief of the Central
Intelligence Agency in Washington after leaving China.
   China considers Bush an ``old friend,'' an important moniker in
this land where the distinction between friends and enemy is clear.
The government openly rooted for Bush to win the presidency and
Chinese leaders were pleased when he was elected.
   But when the Bushes lived here, Beijing was a forbidding place
for foreigners.
   China was still in the throes of the ultra-leftist Cultural
Revolution. Chinese were not allowed to talk to foreigners and were
often questioned by police if they did.
   To cut some of the isolation, Bush and his wife often left their
U.S. government car at home and rode ``Forever'' brand Chinese
bicycles.
   They went to Sunday church services for foreigners. Bush played
tennis daily at the International Club while Mrs. Bush dabbled in
Tai Ch'i, a Chinese breathing exercise.
   Mostly they fraternized with other foreigners because of the
conditions at the time.
   ``In 1975, hardly anyone Chinese outside of the Foreign Ministry
would speak to us,'' said a Western diplomat, who served in Beijing
in the 1970s. ``We were pariah, dangerous. So we made do with
ourselves.''
   Coach Wang was one of the few Chinese Bush saw almost every day.
   ``He'd ride down here on his bicycle. Tennis balls in one basket,
and soda pop and ice in another,'' said Wang. ``I was always glad to
play him because that meant I could share his cold drinks.''
   Wang said Bush was a pretty good player in doubles but was a
little weak in singles.
   ``I remember when he would win a point with a good shot, he'd
always fall to his knees and stick his arms in the air,'' said Wang,
laughing. ``He was a pretty jolly fellow.''
   Wang wasn't the only one impressed by the Bushes' bicycles.
   ``The moment I saw the Bushes riding toward our little church I
knew there was something special about them,'' said Kan. ``They
didn't put on snobbish, diplomatic airs.''
   Kan and his colleague, the Rev. Shi Zesheng, met the Bushes
regularly. At the request of the diplomatic community, the pair, who
had been forced to work in the countryside during the early part of
the Cultural Revolution, began Christian church services for
foreigners only.
   The services took place in the old Bible House. Kan and Shi were
not allowed to preach but Kan led hymns and Shi accompanied on the
piano.
   ``I remember one winter day very clearly,'' said Kan. ``Mr. Bush
was late. Instead of hanging up his big blue cotton coat, he rolled
it up and stuffed it under his chair. I remember thinking, `He
really is a regular guy.'''
   Another day stands out in Shi's mind _ ``the day we baptized Mr.
Bush's daughter.''
   It was Aug. 8, 1975, the 16th birthday of Dorothy Bush, now
Dorothy Bush LeBlond.
   ``He wanted to give her a special present,'' Shi said. ``So we
talked with our superiors and they agreed to let us baptize her.''
   Shi presented the family with a baptismal certificate, done in
his own calligraphy.
   Kan and Shi said they too supported Bush's presidential candidacy.
   ``I still pray for him,'' said Kan. ``I have requested God to
watch over him, this good friend of China.''

   Crescendoing costs and tapering revenue are
forcing many of the nation's major orchestras to bow to financial
pressure by playing more crowd-pleasing music and jazzing up their
image to lure new fans.
   ``We've been doing the same concerts for 200 years now. It's a
fixed animal. It hasn't changed. Not even the dress has changed,''
said Gideon Toeplitz, managing director of the Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra. ``But what has changed is what attracts the audiences.''
   ``You have to make it an exciting event, no matter what it
takes,'' agreed Joanna Broussard, spokeswoman for the New Orleans
Symphony Orchestra. ``We're competing for the same leisure dollar
that goes to the movies on Saturday night.''
   The problem, once pianissimo, is now fortissimo:
   _ In New Orleans, symphony concerts are scheduled to resume March
8 after more than a year of silence due to a local recession that
crippled orchestral funding. The comeback is due to a debt reduction
plan that includes the sale of the Orpheum Theater, the orchestra's
home.
   _ In Nashville, Tenn., the symphony has emerged from bankruptcy
and is back in operation following a seven-month moratorium, thanks
to contributions from corporatio
   ``We get a lot of one-time people, a lot of quick come-and-go,''
Toeplitz said. ``What we need to do, in the long run, is build
commitments.''

   The next time producers of the Grammy awards want
to pay tribute to the music industry's past, they may have to
consider the long-playing record. With LP sales falling drastically
and the compact disc's popularity soaring, the future of vinyl
seems, at best, limited.
   ``It's getting close,'' says Jack Eugster, chairman of the
Musicland chain, whose 685 stores nationwide include Musicland and
Sam Goody. ``I don't think anyone wants to say goodbye, but it's
certainly not going to be a category that anybody is going to be
stocking in any depth.''
   Figures released by the Recording Industry Association of America
show that in 1985 the CD sold 22.6 million units nationwide compared
to 167 million for the LP.
   But by 1987, the CD had pulled virtually even, selling 102.1
million units while LP sales dropped to 107 million. Figures
available for the first half of 1988 show an even more drastic shift
with records moving just 43.5 million units and CDs selling 70.4
million.
   While record stores are busy returning unsold LPs, U2's ``The
Joshua Tree'' recently became the first CD to be certified platinum
for selling a million copies. The ``Dirty Dancing'' soundtrack, Def
Leppard's ``Hysteria,'' and ``Faith'' by George Michael have all
followed suit.
   But as major labels and record stores follow the market, others
insist that LPs sound better than CDs and should not be phased out.
LPs generally sell for about $8.98 and CDs are in the $10-$20 range.
   CDs are digitally mastered (as opposed to analog for LP), a
concept first tested in France in the 1920s. Digital recorders
sample sound waves at a rate of a little over 44,000 times a second
and put them back together, resulting in a ``clean'' but sometimes
hollow sound.
   The effect could be compared to watching a film, which consists
of a series of still frames run at a high enough speed to give the
appearance of a moving picture. Analog recordings pick up everything
that's sent out, increasing the chance for hiss and distortion but
also producing a fuller sound.
   The necessary equipment for digital was not available, however,
until the '60s when NHK, the Japanese public televison station,
worked with Sony and Denon America to develop prototype recorders.
   Digital recordings (also known as PCM, or Pulse Code Modulation)
were first demonstrated in the late '60s and became available to the
general public in 1972 when Denon released the Mozart Hunting Suite
by the Smetana Quartet.
   PCM recordings were only available on vinyl and cassette until
the '80s when they were issued in the form of a 5-inch ``compact
disc'' developed by Sony and Phillips, and they quickly became the
hottest audio item of the decade.
   ``Analog recordings are subject to the environment and get
destroyed. There are old recordings of Vladimir Horowitz that are
gone,'' said Robert Heiblim, executive vice president of Denon
America Records, which produces both digital and analog recordings.
``With CDs we can just keep making copies so we have it forever.
   ``What the engineer hears in the recording studio the consumer
does not hear on analog. Sometimes they get less than one-fifth the
sound quality. The digital allows you to hear what the engineer
hears. Also each analog recording we stamp out sounds slightly less
good than the first. In compact disc or digital recordings, the
millionth copy is the same as the first copy.''
   But some authorities disagree.
   ``With the compact disc, you're listening to a musical event
without the sense of being there,'' said Larry Archibald of Stereo
File magazine.
   ``The second thing is that high frequencies in analog are more
easily and graciously produced than in digital and the third thing
has to do with general low-level information _ subtle clues about
the recording site and where the recording was made; little details
in the sound of instruments. Digital tends to lose this.''
   Harry Pearson, publisher of The Absolute Sound, also prefers
analog recordings.
   ``You've got to consider that analog technology is 100 years old
and it's been refined and perfected,'' he said. ``This is the first
generation of digital technology. It's going to take a long time for
digital to sound as good as analog. Analogue retrieves more
information because digital cannot reproduce a wide band signal.''
   CDs are not immune to damage. Though no wear occurs during play
since they are grooveless and operated by a beam of light, they can
still be scatched and dirt stains or smudges can cause mistracking.
Extreme temperatures also can damage CDs.
   Lou Dennis, the senior vice president of sales at Warner Bros.
Records, isn't taking sides. He's letting the sales figures speak
for themselves.
   ``We're not trying to form people's opinion, we're reacting to
the market. Our job is to make available what people want to buy,''
he said. ``If the market buys something, it will be available. If I
ship 1,000 LPs and take back 582, the market has told me they're not
interested.''
   Because LPs are selling so poorly, four of the six major record
companies (Warner Elektra Asylum; Capitol EMI Manhattan Angel; and
CBS) have increased their penalties from 5 to 10 percent for records
returned. For example, a Sam Goody store might order 1,000 LPs of
the new Paul McCartney album but only be able to sell 500. The
remaining copies could be returned to the record company but the
store would be penalized.
   ``It's a real challenge to stay in stock. It puts pressure on you
to do very well. There are certain titles that are not brought out
in LP, that's an increasing percent,'' Eugster said.
   Since the major labels are unlikely to put their entire catalog
on CD, analog proponents are worried that some records will become
difficult to find. Gene Dingernari, co-owner of Footlight Records, a
Manhattan store that buys and sells used LPs, says business has
expanded greatly.
   ``So much of what we have is just not available on CD,'' he said.
``Some of the most expensive records are the ones that were the
dogs. They've become very rare and unavailable. We deal with
collectors who are still hooked on vinyls.''
   One such collector is Frank Doris, the technical director of The
Absolute Sound. ``Ten years ago, you get could get any of Frank
Zappa's records, either on Verve or Reprise, for $3 to $5,'' Doris
said. ``Now they're worth $15 to $50. Also the Grateful Dead, you
could find their albums easily 10 years ago, now they're going for
$20 or $30.''
   The audio magazines, while conceding that digital recordings are
here to stay, have urged the music industry not to turn its back
entirely on the LP. But Archibald sees little chance of the industry
giving way.
   ``Unfortunately, I see a future where LPs will only fill a niche
market,'' he said. ``Most of the major recording studios are now
done in digital. Those recordings will inherently miss some of the
great information from analog recordings.''

   The China that President Bush returns to this week
is brasher, brighter and better-dressed than it was when he lived
here in 1974 and 1975, but it is also a country riven by discontent
and searching for a new role in the world.
   Chinese officials were openly pleased by the election of Bush,
the first U.S. president to have lived in China since Herbert Hoover
came as a mining engineer in 1900. ``He understands China,'' many
said.
   But China has undergone vast changes since Bush lived here as
head of the U.S. Liaison Office that was established in the early
days of the U.S.-Chinese reapproachment that culminated with full
diplomatic relations in 1979. It has changed much even since he last
visited in 1985.
   As it was before the Communist revolution, China these days is
torn between confidence in its historic greatness, defensiveness
about its poverty, envy of richer nations and determination not to
simply copy them.
   China in 1974 was still in the grip of the Cultural Revolution, a
violent, decade-long struggle by radical leftists to create a pure,
egalitarian society untouched by foreign or ``bourgeois'' influence.
   The few thousand foreigners who lived in Beijing, mostly
diplomats, were allowed few contacts with Chinese. Giving a
foreigner directions on the street could land a Chinese at the
police station for hours of interrogation.
   Other than government officials, the only Chinese Bush had an
opportunity for regular contact with were his tennis coach and
government-assigned servants.
   Chairman Mao Tse-tung was rarely seen in public _ Bush saw him
only twice _ but his face and his sayings were omnipresent and he
was likened to the sun, sending his revolutionary influence
everywhere.
   Pursuit of individual wealth was an offense against communism, as
was wearing high heels, braiding one's hair, dancing or playing any
music other than a handful of approved revolutionary songs.
   About the only dissipation allowed was smoking.
   China in 1989 is awash with dissipation. In the cities, women in
tight skirts slowdance with men sporting long sideburns at discos
that play Western pop music. Small private bars have begun appearing
around Beijing and pool tables line the streets in warm weather.
   In the countryside, men prosperous from capitalist-style schemes
gamble their earnings away, sometimes eliciting the well-publicized
ire of local women's groups. Prostitution has returned to some
coastal cities, bringing with it veneral disease.
   Most of the more than 10,000 foreigners who now live in China
still live separately from Chinese, but restrictions on contacts
with Chinese are much relaxed.
   Young men with frizzy perms change currency illegally on the
sidewalks, sometimes physically accosting passing foreigners.
   Except for his portrait hanging at Tiananmen Gate and his body
lying in a mausoleum a few hundred yards away, Mao is little seen.
The autobiography of American automaker Lee Iococca is a best seller
at the state-run Xinhua Bookstore, but the store no longer stocks
posters of Mao.
   The Communist Party has acknowledged that Mao made ``serious
mistakes'' in launching the Cultural Revolution, and a few daring
intellectuals have urged the party to give up its exclusive hold on
power.
   Few Chinese who watched the life-and-death power struggle inside
the party during the Cultural Revolution and wanton destruction of
property and lives still accept the party's claim to selflessly
serve the people.
   Disillusioned with Marxism and bored with ideologies, many people
have refocused on making money and trying to get the most out of the
current policy of allowing limited free enterprise.
   Increased crime and corruption, growing rudeness in daily social
exchanges, and increased interest among intellectuals in going
abroad to study _ and perhaps stay _ all reflect the new
me-firstism. Workers and farmers hungry for a bigger share of the
pie have held sporadic strikes.
   As a nation, too, China is groping for a redefinition of its
role. In the early 1970s, China still believed it was at the
vanguard of a world revolution that would free working people from
exploitation.
   Now, China would like to play the role of a world power in
settling issues such as the Middle East conflict, but lacks the
economic and military clout. At the same time, it emphasizes its
poverty and backwardness in seeking concessionary loans and
technological help abroad.
   Whether or not Bush understands China, China is seeking to
understand him. His autobiography has been translated into Chinese,
and is starting to show up in bookstore windows.

<HEAD>Bush Writes Rules for Budget Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

   Whatever the game, smart money goes on the side
that knows how to take advantage of the rules. So far in the 1989
budget contest, that would be President Bush's team.
   In presenting the new budget and in preliminary talks with
Congress on it _ and the old federal deficit _ the administration
has set the agenda. That's an advantage in any negotiation.
   The real bargaining is yet to come, but Bush has the upper hand
as it begins. He has presented a basically conservative budget, but
one that includes some thrifty proposals for added social program
spending at home.
   That certainly offers no reprise of the Great Society, even
though some Democrats said the Republican budget shifted priorities
in their direction. The change from the budget left by Ronald Reagan
has more to do with tone and direction than with actual numbers.
   With no real money to spend on new programs, Bush emphasized what
would be minimal increases for education, environment, the homeless,
child care and other domestic programs. He put compensating spending
cuts in the pending file for discussion with congressional
Democrats. That's drawn some Democratic complaints that the budget
isn't as specific as the law requires, an argument that will go
nowhere. Congress annually ignores its own budget laws.
   Bush followed his campaign script in recommending a freeze on
most federal programs, a freeze in two flavors. He would curb
Pentagon spending with an inflation-adjusted freeze, allowing dollar
increases but no real growth and thus curtailing the Reagan defense
budget, for a year anyhow. He would rein in domestic programs with
what the administration calls a ``nominal freeze,'' holding spending
to prior amounts without regard to inflation.
   Budget cuts had been defined in terms of current services,
meaning the cost of maintaining a program from one year to the next
was adjusted for inflation and for increases in the number of people
offered the service or subsidy involved.
   That way, even if more money went into a program, it was deemed
to have been cut if the increase didn't keep pace with inflation and
caseloads.
   The Bush budget changed that.
   ``We are being conned,'' said Richard Darman, the new director of
the Office of Management and Budget. ``There are an awful lot of
politicians who are calling things cuts that aren't cuts.''
   The logic applies in the opposite direction, too. Measured the
old way, the domestic budget freeze represents a cut of at least
$9.6 billion.
   Itemized cuts have yet to come; Bush said those should emerge in
negotiations with Congress.
   ``Mine is a budget that will not work with business as usual,''
he said in one of three speeches he gave on the road in a quick
campaign to promote his budget while Congress was in recess. ``It
will require a partnership with the Congress. My team and I are
prepared to work with the Congress, to negotiate in good faith with
the leadership, to work day and night if that's what it takes to
meet budget targets and to produce a budget on time.''
   On time would mean passage of the 13 appropriations bills that
finance the federal government by Oct. 1, the government new year.
That deadline hadn't been met in a dozen years until 1988, when
Congress was spurred by crisis _ the stock market collapse of
October, 1987.
   Instead, Congress wound up passing resolutions to continue
federal spending at earlier rates so the government wouldn't run out
of money. Sometimes it did, before the catchall resolutions were
approved. Often they were giant, incomprehensible, last-minute
measures, sometimes passed before members of Congress could read the
law they were writing.
   As a candidate, Bush said flatly that he would not tolerate the
practice. But there is little chance that, absent a crisis like the
Wall Street crash, the on-time appropriations performance of 1988
can be repeated in 1989.
   According to the White House, the administration will set out
areas and guidelines for budget cuts, with specifics to await
negotiation with Congress.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the president's press secretary, said that
should avoid confrontation. ``We want it to be cooperative, a
partnership kind of arrangement,'' he said.
   While it lasts, that's a partnership in which Bush can't lose.
The strain will start showing when Democrats insist on negotiating _
and voting _ not just on cuts but on increases in their priority
programs.

   Veteran globe-trotter George Bush sets out
Wednesday on his first overseas journey as president, a fast-paced
trip to three Asian nations anxious about America's budget problems
and its military commitments abroad.
   Over 5{ days, Bush will travel to Japan, China, South Korea and
back home again. More than 36 hours of his time will be spent on Air
Force One flying from place to place.
   Playing down expectations, White House officials said the trip
offers an opportunity to demonstrate resolve and affinity with
friends and the region. ``It would be unreasonable to expect major
resolution of policy issues four weeks into the administration,''
one official said.
   ``Symbolically it's important,'' said Robert A. Scalapino,
director of the Institute of East Asian Studies at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``There's no region in the world in which we
have greater economic, political and strategic interests.
   The trip originated with Bush's decision to attend the funeral
Friday of Japanese Emperor Hirohito, which will attract scores of
world leaders. The president has defended his decision to attend the
funeral amid criticism from those who still resent Hirohito's role
in World War II.
   ``I'm doing what's right,'' the president said recently.
   Bush, a former Navy aviator whose plane was shot down by the
Japanese in the Pacific in 1944, said, ``We have a good relationship
with Japan. I want to see it even better. And this doesn't concern
me a bit. And you're talking to a person who was in combat in World
War II. I feel you look ahead, not always look back. You do what's
right.''
   Taking advantage of the occasion, Bush will hold separate talks
in Tokyo with 16 to 20 heads of state or government, including
French President Francois Mitterrand, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, Jordan's King Hussein and Philippine President Corazon
Aquino.
   Bush's trip comes at a time of concern in Asia that budget and
trade deficits could prompt the United States to scale down its
defense commitments or to demand that allies shoulder a bigger share
of regional security costs. In particular, there are tensions over
the big trade imbalances that Japan and South Korea have with the
United States.
   ``There is a good deal of anxiety in this region about the future
of the American economy, the degree to which our strategic
commitments might be cut back,'' said Scalapino.
   Bush will meet in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita, their second visit in three weeks following a White House
conference Feb. 2. White House officials believe Takeshita's
attention will be diverted by the funeral and his role as host for
foreign dignitaries, and that there will not be much opportunity to
tackle substantive issues.
   After two nights in Tokyo, Bush will fly to Beijing for a
nostalgic visit to a country where he served for more than a year as
the U.S. envoy. He will visit major landmarks such as the Great Hall
of the People and meet with Chinese leaders, including 84-year-old
Deng Xiaoping, Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and
Premier Li Peng.
   Bush will spend two nights in Beijing and then take an early
morning flight to South Korea.
   With anti-Americanism on the rise from both the left and the
right, Seoul is bracing for demonstrations during Bush's stop.
   Bush will be there less than five hours, visiting President Roh
Tae Woo at the presidential palace called the Blue House and
delivering a speech at the National Assembly. Traveling by
helicopter, Bush will not be exposed to any disruptions by
demonstrators.
   Bush, who visited 74 countries in his eight years as vice
president, stopped in Japan, South Korea and China during a 1982
journey. He visited Japan again in 1984 and China again in 1985.
   Some commentators have suggested that Bush's visit to Beijing _
before any trip to Moscow _ is a snub to the Kremlin. However, Bush
denied that he was trying to play China off against the Soviet
Union, saying recently, ``There's nothing of that nature in this
visit.''
   Bush's visit to Beijing comes amid a warming in relations between
China and the Soviet Union. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will go
to Beijing in May for the first Sino-Soviet summit in three decades.
   Scalapino said he expects Bush will welcome improvement in
Sino-Soviet relations ``because they may make possible settlements
of some of the more thorny political issues in Asia,'' such as the
divisions between North and South Korea.
   Bush said that since he already would be in Japan, a stop in
China ``just seemed like an appropriate visit.''
   Administration officials said it would have been a slight to the
Seoul government if he didn't stop there, as well.
   ``The very fact he's giving a public speech is in itself of some
significance,'' said Scalapino. ``How many presidents have addressed
the Korean National Assembly?''

   U.S. industry is using more of its capacity
than at any other time in nearly a decade, the government said in a
report that showed operating rates approaching levels that could
worsen inflation.
   The stock and bond markets were not alarmed by Wednesday's
report. Bond prices rose modestly and the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials climbed 22.68 points to 2,303.93. The dollar fell
sharply but later made back most of its losses.
   The Federal Reserve Board said January's operating rate of 84.4
percent of capacity was unchanged from December, for which the
figure was revised upward from an earlier estimate of 84.2 percent.

   Business inventories rose 0.9 percent in
December and sales increased at almost the same pace despite a
buildup in stockpiles of unsold autos as car purchases lagged, the
government said.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that inventories held on
shelves and back lots rose to a seasonally adjusted $760.6 billion
in December, while sales reached $508.2 billion.
   December's 0.9 percent increase in inventories followed a 0.4
percent increase in November. Sales, meanwhile, rose 0.8 percent in
December following a 0.4 percent increase in November.

   Oil imports last month surged to the highest rate
since 1980 as domestic production fell and consumption rose,
reviving fears that foreign producers may soon control more than
half of U.S. oil supplies, energy analysts said.
   The American Petroleum Institute, which represents major oil
producers and refiners, said Wednesday that U.S. crude oil
production fell to 7.9 million barrels a day, a 3.4 percent drop
from January 1988.
   Alaskan oil production, which in recent years offset declines in
other parts of the United States, slipped for the second straight
month with no major new oil fields tapped. About a quarter of U.S.
oil comes from Alaska.

   Consumer activist Ralph Nader called on
President Bush and Congress to force rich people, stock traders and
corporations, rather than average taxpayers, to pay for the savings
and loan crisis.
   ``If the bankers and the bureaucrats think they're going to
resolve this massive savings and loan crime on the backs of tens of
millions of ordinary U.S. taxpayers as part of their little
inner-Washington club deliberation, they're wrong,'' Nader said
Wednesday.
   Bush last week announced a proposal to spend $200 billion over
the next 30 years _ about half of it from general tax revenues _ to
sell or close 350 insolvent institutions and meet government
commitments made last year in the rescue of another 205 S&amp;Ls.

   Union Carbide Corp. became a takeover
target after the 1984 Bhopal gas leak depressed its stock, and some
analysts said the chemical giant could face another raid with the
cloud of Bhopal lifted.
   But others said Wednesday the surge in Carbide stock incited by
the settlement that was announced Tuesday could help protect the
company from a takeover by making it more expensive to acquire.
   Carbide agreed Tuesday to a Supreme Court of India ruling that
ordered the company to pay $470 million by March 31 to settle all
claims stemming from the Bhopal gas leak, which left more than 3,300
people dead.

<HEAD>`Rugged Individualism' Hurting American Business, Specialist Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   An American management guru credited with
helping to pull Japan's business out of the rubble of World War II
says he wishes his own country would adopt his methods.
   W. Edwards Deming, an 88-year-old statistician and scientist who
built a management style stressing quality and worker happiness,
said America is headed for more trade woes if it clings to the
``rugged individualism, win-lose'' approach in running business.
   ``It's short-term thinking. Much of our talent is spent churning
money, looking for a takeover,'' Deming told about 500 students,
faculty and business leaders Wednesday at the University of
Tennessee.
   ``It's a win-lose system. It's rugged individualism out of which
comes the so-called merit system. Competition means increase your
share of the market _ `I win, you lose.'''
   Snubbed by American companies in the 1950s, Deming took his ideas
to Japan, where businesses decided they had nothing to lose and
adopted his theories. Since then, Japan created the Deming Prizes,
based on a medal of honor he received from Emperor Hirohito.
   Some of the Deming Prize winners, such as Fuji Photo and
Mitsubishi Electronic, are among the most successful in penetrating
American markets.
   Starting about 1980, some U.S. businesses began expressing
interest in the Deming method, but significant commitment has yet to
jell, said Deming, who jets around to various corporations to teach
his methods.
   Some of his main points:
   _Don't make quick profits and stock prices the main corporate
objectives.
   _Make quality control, from the procurement of materials on up, a
high priority, since it actually brings down the cost of production.
   _Work closely with as few suppliers as possible and don't
automatically sign contracts with the lowest bidder.
   _Assign responsibility for good product design at the top
management echelon.
   Deming likened the United States to a colony, selling off its
metal, real estate and other raw materials while buying finished
goods from other countries.
   ``Forty-four percent of the real estate in downtown Los Angeles
is owned by the Japanese,'' he said. ``Our natural resources are
petering out. How can this be? Things were so good,'' he said of the
country's prosperous post-war years.
   ``We ship out aluminum, nickel, coal, real estate, scrap metal. A
colony ships out raw materials and buys back manufactured goods,''
he said. ``We've become a colony.''
   He also decried the grading and evaluations systems used by
American managers and educators.
   ``The so-called merit system has destroyed us,'' he said. ``What
are grades? They are predictions. A high grade is a prediction that
(a worker) will perform well 10 years from now under conditions
nobody would dare foretell.
   ``People are entitled to joy in learning ... joy in work,'' he
said.
   ``Rugged individualism _ the days when it could work passed about
three decades ago. We must change our economics to cooperation.
Everybody wins. Equally? No, but everybody (is) better.''

   Eastern Airlines' Machinist union members talked
about ``getting even'' as they overwhelming supported a strike
against the troubled carrier if no contract is reached by a March 3
federal deadline.
   ``Ever since (Texas Air Chairman Frank) Lorenzo took over, it's
like the Soviet Union has taken us over,'' union member Angel
Rodriguez said at a packed union hall meeting Wednesday night. ``At
last we can do something _ strike. Everybody has been looking
forward to that. It's getting even time.''
   Union leader Charles Bryan announced Wednesday that 97 percent of
the voting membership had authorized a strike if no contract was
reached by midnight March 3, when a federally imposed, 30-day
cooling off period expires. Eastern could then impose its own work
rules.
   The Miami-based carrier says it has focused on negotiating a
settlement, but the union maintains Eastern has been stalling the
talks and hasn't engaged in true bargaining.
   ``They have not moved in 16 months in their original opening
position,'' Bryan said.
   Eastern worker Guy Knaak, who has been working on strike
contingency plans while on a 30-day suspension for walking out in a
dispute over mandatory overtime, said Lorenzo has not budged while
the union has made some concessions.
   ``I don't think Frank Lorenzo wants a settlement,'' Knaak said.
   The union also contended that management has started recruitment
of possible strikebreakers.
   Members of the Machinists union, representing 8,500 machinists,
baggage handlers and other ground workers, have been working without
a contract for 13 months. If there is no resolution by late next
week, federal mediators plan to bring both sides together in
Washington.
   The Machinists represent more than a quarter of Eastern's work
force. Eastern management has been seeking substantial contract
concessions, saying the union members' wages are too high and have
made the airline non-competitive.
   Meanwhile, the carrier charged that an illegal work slowdown has
backed up 19 aircraft and delayed flights.
   Eastern attorney David Ross charged in federal court Wednesday
that the Machinists have caused the aircraft backup by taking twice
the normal time to perform tasks ranging from routine mechanical
inspections to major overhauls.
   ``Historically we have had no backup,'' the attorney said. ``We
would normally only have a certain number (of planes) in being done
and then put back in service.''
   Bryan called the charge ``a smokescreen. The work is being done.''
   Bryan said that Eastern's recent performance _ it advertises
itself as the No. 1 on-time operator in the industry, citing federal
figures _ refutes the carrier's allegation of widespread work
slowdowns.
   ``How could that possibly be going on if our people are slowing
down?'' he said.
   The airline and union also pressed their arguments in federal
court Wednesday regarding the subcontracting of work traditionally
done by organized labor.
   U.S. Senior District Judge C. Clyde Atkins agreed to accept the
Machinists subcontracting case, after U.S. District Judge James W.
Kehoe granted Eastern's motion Wednesday to send the case to Atkins.
   Atkins, who ordered an end to a wildcat strike by ground crews
last week, directed Eastern to file a response in the subcontracting
case by noon today.
   In an amended complaint filed Tuesday, the airline said it had no
choice but to subtract certain work because of ``circumstances
beyond its control.''
   In another development, the union charged that Eastern has
started recruiting strikebreakers with newspaper ads offering
airport opportunities for baggage handlers, agents and managers but
listing no employer.

<HEAD>Healthier Frozen Dinner Line Stems From Chairman's Heart Attack</HEAD>

   The country's healthiest line of supermarket
frozen dinners owes its existence to the heart attack of an
agribusiness giant _ Charles M. Harper, the 6-foot-6 chairman and
chief executive of ConAgra Inc.
   The idea for a lower-fat, lower-salt line of frozen dinners came
to Harper as he lay recuperating from the heart attack that struck
him on a business trip Sept. 14, 1985, he says.
   Healthy Choice was served up to the national press Wednesday on
plastic trays by maroon-jacketed waiters at New York's posh Plaza
hotel, with Harper on the dais.
   ``This isn't just for people on restricted diets. This is for
healthy people that like to be healthy,'' Harper said in an
interview.
   The low-calorie segment of the frozen dinner market is the
fastest-growing, expanding an average of 24 percent a year from 1983
to 1987, according to Business Trends Inc., a market research firm.
It estimated that 1987 sales of low-calorie meals reached $1.5
billion.
   Harper said he issued the challenge to his research and
development staff after his wife, Josie, invented some healthful but
tasty dishes at home, convincing him that ConAgra could do the same.
   ``To make it taste good _ that was the toughest thing. There's an
entertainment value to food,'' he said.
   Other low-calorie frozen dinner lines have some dishes that are
low in fat and relatively low in salt, but ConAgra's entry is more
consistently healthy, nutrition experts said.
   Healthy Choice meets the dietary recommendations of the American
Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health, although it
does not have their endorsement.
   ``A consumer can buy the Healthy Choice and know that they're
going to get lower sodium, lower fat. With the others you have to
read the label to find out,'' Evelyn Tribole, a dietitian and
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, said in a
telephone interview.
   Most companies do a lot of their calorie-cutting simply by making
portions smaller, Ms. Tribole said. Healthy Choice portions are
heavier than the competition's.
   Darlene Doherty, president of the association, said the closest
products to Healthy Choice are frozen-dinner lines that Baxter
International Inc. and Diamond Crystal Specialty Foods Inc. sell to
health-care facilities for distribution to patients.
   ConAgra is second in the overall frozen-dinner market, with a 28
percent share, behind Campbell Soup Co.'s 29 percent, according to
Business Trends. ConAgra's other principal brands are Banquet,
Armour, Morton, Patio, Chun King and Sensible Chef.
   Healthy Choice is already available in about a quarter of the
country.
   ConAgra has no plans to reduce fat and salt in all its
frozen-dinner brands, even though it would make them more healthful,
Harper said. ``We will continue to make products that people want.''
   As an example of Healthy Choice's nutritional breakdown, its
chicken parmigiana dinner has 290 calories, 65 milligrams of
cholesterol and 320 milligrams of sodium. It derives 15 percent of
its calories from fat, and 6 percent of those calories from
saturated fat.
   By comparison, Campbell's Le Menu chicken parmigiana dinner has
380 calories, 890 milligrams of sodium and 43 percent of its
calories from fat. Figures on cholesterol and saturated fat are not
available.
   The Weight Watchers brand equivalent, which is an entree rather
than a full meal, has 280 calories, 85 milligrams of cholesterol,
840 milligrams of sodium, 51 percent of its calories from fat, and
19 percent of those calories from saturated fat.

<HEAD>Analysts Divided On Whether Bhopal Settlement Increases Takeover

   Union Carbide Corp. could face another
takeover attempt now that the cloud of the Bhopal gas leak has
lifted, though the rise in its stock price after the settlement was
announced could provide protection, analysts say.
   Carbide agreed Tuesday to a Supreme Court of India ruling that
ordered the company to pay $470 million by March 31 to settle all
claims stemming from the 1984 accident, which killed more than 3,300
people.
   The settlement, which is expected to have only a minor effect on
the company's earnings, ended speculation about how much the Bhopal
incident would cost Danbury-based Carbide.
   ``There are a lot of companies that would be interested in the
mix and quality of Carbide's component assets,'' said Barry Sahgal,
director of research at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``It's just a guessing game, but what one can certainly focus on
is the undervaluation of Carbide's assets in the marketplace,'' he
said Wednesday. ``It's an upstock. It's attractive for investors.
The risk reward looks quite compelling.''
   News of the settlement sent Carbide's stock soaring by $2 a share
Tuesday in heavy trading to close at $31.125. It advanced another
$1.375 Wednesday to $32.50, its highest level over the past year.
   ``I'm in the camp that says (the settlement) does not make them a
more attractive candidate,'' said James Wilbur, a vice president
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. Inc. in New York.
   ``While the settlement of the Bhopal issues does relieve that
concern about liability ... the increase in the price yesterday
makes a takeover about $270 million more expensive.''
   Even before the settlement, Wall Street was rife with speculation
that a takeover bid could emerge. One rumor Feb. 7 pushed Carbide up
$2 a share with more than 9.16 million shares traded, several times
the ordinary volume.
   There has been talk that Carbide might fetch $50 a share as the
target of a takeover fight, which would make the total value of the
company about $7 billion. Carbide has approximately 140 million
shares outstanding.
   Three names have been mentioned as possible suitors, including
investor Edmund Safra of Safra Republic Holdings, an unidentified
West German chemical Co. and Carl C. Icahn, the well-known takeover
strategist.
   Wilbur suggested that last week's surge simply reflected
investors' desire to take advantage of the 25 percent increase in
the company's quarterly dividend, from 20 to 25 cents a share.
   Carbide increased its dividend in January after slashing it from
$1.50 to 80 cents a share last summer. The move traumatized
stockholders and sent stock plummeting to about $17 a share.
   That would have been a more logical time to attempt a takeover,
Wilbur said.
   ``We have identified at least at eight other companies that would
produce returns to a takeover group that would be higher than Union
Carbide'' right now, he said.
   One stock speculator who requested anonymity said the takeover
talk is ``probably all hot air.''
   ``Right now it's just a $7 billion company that doesn't have the
overhang anymore,'' he said. ``But there are lots of company's that
don't have an overhang.''
   Carbide is vastly different from the far-flung, flourishing
conglomerate it was before the Bhopal catastrophe. It was well known
for consumer products ranging from Eveready batteries to Glad
sandwich bags.
   Its stock fell from about $50 a share to about $35 after the
disaster, leading to a hostile takeover attempt by the much-smaller
GAF Corp. in 1985.
   To fight the takeover, Carbide sold its consumer divisions and
undertook other drastic restructuring steps, including the sale and
lease-back of its headquarters building. Sales slipped to $6.4
billion in 1985 and the company's work force was halved.
   Even before Tuesday's settlement, analysts had said Carbide was
well on its way back.
   In the year ended Dec. 31, the company earned $720 million, or
$5.31 a share, on revenue of $8.32 billion. That compared with 1987
earnings of $231 million, or $1.76 a share, on revenue of $6.91
billion.

   The dollar firmed in early European trading today.
Gold prices also rose.
   Traders in Milan, Italy, said the market was looking ahead to
Friday's release of the December U.S. trade result.
   ``Naturally a monthly deficit under $10 billion will guarantee a

deficit widened sharply to $12.5 billion in November from $10.3
billion in October.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.43 yen to a closing 126.33. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 126.53 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
rate included: 1.8438 West German marks, up from 1.8315; 1.5655
Swiss francs, up from 1.5565; 6.2783 French francs, up from 6.2425;

   In London, one British pound cost $1.7665, cheaper for buyers
than $1.7805 Wednesday.
   Gold prices rose in Europe.
   ``It's amazing,'' said one London bullion dealer. ``One day gold
falls out of bed and the next day people want to buy it.''
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $383.35 a troy ounce, up
from $382.00 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $384.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $383.35, up from $381.60 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 54 cents to close at a bid
$385.20.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.88 a troy ounce,

<HEAD>NHTSA Upgrades Probes of More Than 2 Million GM Cars</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators have intensified three
separate investigations of alleged braking problems and other safety
defects involving more than 2 million General Motors Corp. cars.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday
it had received 428 complaints of poor braking in GM's A-, J- and
N-body cars made in 1987 and 1988.
   The alleged braking problems, according to the unconfirmed
complaints, had resulted in 85 accidents and 29 injuries, NHTSA said.
   The complaints said drivers of the cars had reported brake
failure in some cases and in others an increase in braking distance
to beyond the limits of safety.
   The A-body cars are the Pontiac 6000, Buick Century, Chevrolet
Celebrity and Cutlass Ciera. The J-body cars are the Buick Skyhawk,
Chevrolet Cavalier, Pontiac Sunbird, Cadillac Cimarron and
Oldsmobile Cutlass. The N-body cars are the Buick Skylark, Cutlass
Calais and Pontiac Grand Am.
   The cars use the same brake components, NHTSA said.
   The agency also raised to an engineering analysis its
investigation of allegations that the doors of GM's 1987 and 1988
Chevrolet Beretta and Corsica sometimes fall off when opened due to
defective door-hinge pins.
   NHTSA said 540,000 vehicles were involved in the investigation.
The agency had received 277 unconfirmed reports of doors falling
off, eight of which allegedly involved injury.
   In the third GM case, NHTSA upgraded its probe of power-steering
problems on the 1987 Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro cars.
   The agency said it had received 403 unconfirmed complaints,
including five accidents and one injury, that brackets and bolts
suddenly fractured, causing a loss of power-steering assistance.
   GM declined to give a detailed response to each case.
   ``As always, we'll cooperate with NHTSA,'' GM spokesman John
Anderson said in Washington. ``However, just because there is an
investigation, it does not mean there are any defects present.''
   Asked if the upgrading of an investigation would suggest the
presence of a defect, Anderson said the company would stand by its
statement.
   NHTSA also opened five low-level investigations into safety
allegations involving cars.
   The agency opened preliminary evaluations into allegations of:
   _Seat belt jamming in 50,000 1987-1988 Mercury Tracers made by
Ford Motor Co.
   _Rear-window stop light failure in 1.2 million 1988 GM A- and
J-body 2-door coupes and sedans.
   _Brake light failure on 2,500 Rolls Royce cars made from 1987
through 1989.
   _Sudden movement of the front seat in 150,000 1983-1986 Subarus.
   _Defective windshield wipers in 50,000 1986-1987 Yugos.
   The agency also closed six investigations with the conclusion
there was ``no defect trend.''
   The cases involved unsubstantiated complaints of:
   _Seat-belt latch failure in the 1984 Ford Mustang.
   _Engine compartment fires in the 1980-1988 Ford Crown Victoria.
   _Trunk fires in the 1987-1988 Chrysler Corp. Dodge Daytona.
   _Oil leaks in the 1984 Subaru GL.
   _Battery cable grounding problems in the 1988 Saab 900 Turbo.
   _Front seat-back failure in the 1981 Ford Escort and Mustang.

   Unemployment in Britain fell to a seasonally
adjusted 7 percent of the workforce in January from 7.2 percent in
December, bringing the total number of jobless to its lowest level
in eight years, the government said Thursday.
   The figure was down from 8.9 percent in January 1988, the
Department of Employment said.
   Total seasonally adjusted unemployment was estimated at 1,988,000
people in January, the lowest total since January 1981, and
confirmed widespread expectations that the figure would be below the
2 million-mark.
   It compared with a revised 2,037,000 people in December and
2,519,000 people in January 1988.

<HEAD>Principal in Brokerage Firm Says He's Innocent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founder of Mexico's largest brokerage firm
has declared his innocence on charges of illegal trading and
criminal fraud following his arraignment at a Mexico City prison.
   ``I hope there will be justice. I'm innocent. I believe in the
Mexican laws,'' said Eduardo Legoretta, board chairman and a founder
of Operadora de Bolsa, after being arraigned Wednesday at the city's
Eastern Penitentiary.
   Legoretta and three other top stock brokerage officials were
arrested on Monday and later charged with illegal trading related to
the October 1987 Mexican stock market crash.
   National Securities Commission president Oscar Espinoza Villareal
said no officials of the former presidential administration would be
investigated in connection with the crash, the Notimex news agency
reported.
   A government investigation continues into complaints against
nearly all Mexico's brokerage houses after stockholders lost about
$7 million in the crash.
   The government has said it may seek arrests or sanctions against
another 148 stockbrokers. The fraud complaints surfaced after
Mexico's market index plummeted 74 percent in 28 trading days in
October 1987.
   Legoretta, 44, belongs to one of Mexico's wealthiest families.
His arrest at a Mexico City restaurant Monday night shook the
country'sbusiness community.
   Legoretta told reporters the charges were motivated by what he
claimed were exaggerated and false reports of his personal wealth.
   ``I'm not very rich, I'm not as rich as they're saying. I have
two houses, three cars, and own 30 percent of a yacht. And I earn as
a stockbroker 20 million pesos a month (roughly $8,700),'' he said.
   Also charged were Jaime Ceballos Cervantes, Operadora's director
of investment promotions, and Juan Carlos Fernandez Cuevo and Jose
Francisco Rodriguez Dupont of Mexicana de Valores e Inversiones,
another major brokerage house.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo on Tuesday said
Operadora de Bolsa allegedly sold non-existent Treasury certificates
and falsified clients' trading records. Mexicana de Valores
allegedly traded in securities without clients' consent, he said.
   Convictions on the charges could result in jail terms of up to 12
years for criminal fraud and 10 years for securities trading
violations.
   Espinoza said the 18-month government investigation did not
unearth wrongdoing by officials of the administration of former
President Miguel de la Madrid, Notimex reported. New President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office in December.
   Several opposition congressmen have called for Gustavo
Petricioli, the former treasury secretary and current ambassador to
Washington, to testify about the government's role in the crash.
   Del Castillo on Tuesday did not say how much money was involved.
But Gustavo Diaz, president of a group of investors who say they
were defrauded, estimated the brokerage firms netted $43.5 million
in profits from alleged illegal trading.
   The penal court judge supervising the case had three days from
Wednesday's arraignment to determine whether the charges warrant
formal indictments or to let the four officials go free.

<HEAD>Two Groups Interested In Buying Ames' G.C. Murphy Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four years after it acquired G.C. Murphy Co. in
a $200 million takeover battle, Ames Department Stores Inc. is
considering offers to sell the McKeesport-based discount store chain.
   Ames' spokeswoman Catherine Leonard said the Connecticut-based
retailer is entertaining offers for the division from a G.C. Murphy
management group and McCrory Corp. of York, Pa.
   Garry Brown, general manager of G.C. Murphy's headquarters who is
leading the employee bid, said the management buyout group's bid had
been submitted to Wertheim Schroder, the New York firm that serves
as Ames' investment banker.
   ``The proposal is on their desk,'' Brown said Wednesday.
   He said the bid is for all of the division's stores, including
about 137 units operated under the Murphy variety store banner. Also
included are 25 Bargain World stores and six Office Shop Warehouse
units.
   Brown said the acquisition, if completed, would take the form of
a leveraged buyout, in which a company's own earnings or assets are
used as collateral for loans needed to purchase it.
   McCrory, operator of 1,300 McCrory's general merchandise stores,
has also expressed interest in G.C. Murphy, Leonard said. She
declined to say whether its interest encompassed the entire division.
   A spokesman for McCrory's could not confirm the interest or
whether a formal bid had been submitted.
   It also was unclear whether Ames, which also recently acquired
Zayre's 388-store discount retail chain for $775 million, solicited
offers for G.C. Murphy or merely fielded them.

<HEAD>London Shares Near Low At Midday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were lower at midday Thursday,
pressured by continuing fears about the world interest rate outlook
and some large sell-orders organized by British brokerage firms.
   Attention was fixed on Friday's release of Britain's retail price
index for January, which was expected to show that the annual
inflation rate rose above 7 percent last month, dealers said.
   The West German Bundesbank council's decision to leave its key
interest rate unchanged at 6 percent at its fortnightly meeting
Thursday didn't soothe the London market's concerns about a general
rise in world interest rates, said Kevin Gardiner, an analyst at the
London investment firm Warburg Securities.
   Most market participants believe the Bundesbank has merely
postponed an expected half percentage point rate rise, Gardiner
added.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 17.1
points, or 0.8 percent, at 2,030.4 at about 1 p.m. in London, having
traded as much as 18 points lower an hour earlier. The index fell
steadily from its morning high of 0.9 point up.
   Volume was 426.4 million shares compared with 225.4 million
shares at the same time Wednesday.
   Dealers said they saw little buying interest in the market during
the morning session. Several British brokerage firms organized sell
programs that pushed the leading blue chip stocks lower, they said.

<HEAD>Beef Prices Rise during January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Average retail beef prices across the nation rose 6
cents a pound over the last month, the Denver-based National
Cattlemen's Association said.
   Reporting on its monthly 19-city survey of supermarket beef
prices Wednesday, the association said the average price of five
cuts on Feb. 9 was $2.93 per pound, up from $2.87 per pound on Jan.
12.
   There apparently was less retail featuring _ or special pricing _
of beef and more efforts to market cheaper meats, which are in large
supply, said the association, which noted beef production has
decreased recently.
   Compared with a month earlier, the February five-cut average was
up in 12 cities and down in seven.
   The price average also was affected by a long-term trend of
higher demand and higher prices for the more convenient beef steaks
and a somewhat lower demand for the less convenient cuts like chuck
roast, the association said.
   Over the last month, the national average ground beef price was
unchanged at $1.42 and chuck roast rose only slightly to $1.88.
Other averages were round steak, $2.71; sirloin steak, $3.57; and
T-bone steak, $5.08.
   The individual city averages for the five cuts ranged from $3.75
per pound in New York to $2.37 in San Francisco, with the highest
individual cut price $6.32 per pound for T-bone steak in Baltimore
and the lowest $1.11 for ground beef in Denver.

High</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: To UPDATE with Commerce Department report on January housing

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction jumped 8 percent in January, the biggest
monthly advance in nearly a year, the government said today in a
report providing fresh evidence of robust economic activity.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.69 million units last
month, up from the 1.57 million rate in December.
   Last month's gain, attributed in part to an unusually warm winter
in much of the country, followed a revised 0.1 percent gain in
December and a 2.3 percent rise in November.
   January's was the biggest monthly increase since construction
climbed 8.6 percent in February 1988, and was the highest level of
activity since March 1987, when construction took place at an annual
rate of 1.72 million units.
   The home building news was the latest in a series of recent
government reports showing considerable economic strength.
   On Wednesday, a report said U.S. factories continued to operate
at their highest rate in a decade in January, flirting with output
levels that could strain their capacity and lead to inflation.
   Stock and bond prices rose in spite of the Federal Reserve
Board's report Wednesday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks broke the 2,300-point barrier as it rose 22.68 points to
2,303.93.
   The Federal Reserve said January's operating rate of 84.4 percent
of capacity was unchanged from December. The December figure was
revised upward from an earlier estimate of 84.2 percent.
   The operating rate for January and December has not been
surpassed since October 1979, when factories were functioning at
84.6 percent of capacity.
   ``Historically, capacity utilization rates of around 85 percent
are the flashpoints for a speedup in inflation,'' said Robert
DeFina, senior economist for Security Pacific National Bank in Los
Angeles. ``There are signs that things are getting tight, that
inflation pressures are building.''
   In a related report Wednesday, the Fed reported that its
industrial production index in January climbed 0.3 percent following
a revised increase of 0.5 percent in December. January's increase
was paced by a 0.5 percent rise in manufacturing production.
   As use of industrial capacity rises, so does concern that
factories will have trouble keeping up with orders, leading to
shortages and price increases.
   Although some economists said the Fed needs to tighten credit to
cool off production and slow inflation, Richard Rahn, chief
economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the reports
indicate industrial expansion was unnecessarily restrained by the
Fed's tightening.
   ``Further hiking of the rates will restrict investment in
capacity equipment even more and hold down further growth in
capacity,'' Rahn said.
   A third economic report released Wednesday showed that business
inventories rose 0.9 percent in December while sales jumped 0.8
percent, leaving the ratio of inventories to sales unchanged at 1.50.

<HEAD>BP Posts 5 Percent Profit Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC said Thursday its
after-tax profit rose 5 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier, its results constrained by low crude oil prices.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, BP said its after-tax profit
totaled 272 million pounds, or about $481 million at current
exchange rates, on an historical cost basis compared with 260
million pounds in the same period a year earlier.
   The historical cost figure includes inventory losses or gains and
is comparable to the first in first out (FIFO) accounting method.
   On a current cost basis, which values the company's oil
inventories at existing prices and is more in line with the typical
American system of last in first out (LIFO), after-tax profit fell
23 percent to 304 million pounds, or the equivalent of $538 million,
from 394 million pounds in the year ago period.
   Earnings per share came to 4.5 pence, or about 8 cents, up
slightly from 4.4 pence. Fourth-quarter sales fell 9 percent to 6.4
billion pounds from 7 billion pounds in the 1987 period.
   Oil and gas exploration and production results suffered from weak
crude prices, despite the benefits of integrating Britoil PLC, which
BP acquired late in 1987, the oil giant said.
   BP's refining and marketing businesses provided a ``partial
hedge,'' helped by good demand for products and lower costs, the
company said.
   For all of 1988, after-tax profit fell 13 percent to 1.21 billion
pounds on an historical cost basis from 1.39 billion pounds in 1987.
   Current cost after-tax profit rose 10 percent to 1.44 billion
pounds from 1.31 billion pounds.
   Per-share earnings for the year declined to 20 pence from 24.9
pence. Sales in 1988 fell 8 percent to 25.9 billion pounds from 28.3
billion pounds.

   The stock market pushed ahead today, extending
Wednesday's rally as interest rates declined.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.43 to 2,310.36 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 9 to 5 in nationwide

   Enthusiasm for stocks did not seem to be dampened much by worries
about the monthly report due out Friday on the country's
international trade balance.
   Wall Street economists generally expect the figures to show about
a $12 billion trade deficit for December, compared with the $12.5

November.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Union Carbide, up { at 33;

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

index was up .32 at 325.34.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 22.68 to

   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 on the

   Venezuela Thursday geared up for sharp
economic adjustments, including a big devaluation of the bolivar.
   Venezuelan president Carlos Andres Peerez, who took office two
weeks ago, is scheduled to address the nation to outline a package
of adjustments Thursday evening.
   The Venezuelan economy has been badly hit in recent years with
the slide in oil prices and the service of its $33 billion debt, the
fourth largest in the hemisphere.
   The economic reforms to be announced will include a currency
devaluation between 45 and 55 percent, according to government
sources.
   Other measures will include unification of an exchange system
blamed for draining the country's reserves the past several years,
liberation of bank interest rates, and elimination of price controls.

<TEXT>
   Pennwalt Corp. chairman Edwin E. Tuttle won't
discuss his position on Centaur Partners' increased offer for the
company, while Centaur today announced it has scheduled a special
shareholders' meeting on the offer.
   The New York investment firm, in a statement, said it scheduled
the meeting for March 30 at Pennwalt's headquarters in Philadelphia.
   Pennwalt spokeswoman Sue Kinard said the company had no comment.
She also said no date had been set for a Pennwalt board meeting
where, according to Tuttle, the board will consider Centaur's latest
offer.
   Centaur on Tuesday raised its offer from $100 to $110 per share
for the chemical company. Its proposals to shareholders include
removing all members of the Pennwalt board and electing new
directors nominated by Centaur.
   ``It is obviously a higher price,'' Tuttle told The Philadelphia
Inquirer on Wednesday. ``What conclusions the board will come to
will have to wait for (a special board) meeting to take place.''
   He did not disclose a date for the meeting.
   Pennwalt's stock climbed Wednesday to $114.125, up $1 in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``I think we have to consider any offer seriously,'' Tuttle said.
``And we considered the first one seriously. After that serious
consideration, we came up with a very firm conclusion that one, it
was not a bona fide offer and was highly conditional. Two, it was
certainly inadequate. And three, the Centaur people were not very
worthy.''
   Centaur, which has sought a shareholder meeting in the absence of
a meeting with the Pennwalt board, claims the partnership gained
enough support to have a shareholder meeting called.
   Pennwalt sought an injunction to block the meeting, but a federal
judge last week affirmed Centaur's right to have it called. The
company has filed an appeal.
   ``We have the financing,'' Centaur spokesman Jerry Seeman said.
``We are not investing in Pennwalt to destroy it. ... It is for the
shareholders to decide the merits of our offer. Not Mr. Tuttle
alone.''

   Wheat futures prices opened mixed while other
grain and soybean futures were nearly unchanged in early trading
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A pickup in export demand for U.S. wheat, including a purchase by
Algeria of 125,000 metric tons at subsidized prices, gave old-crop
wheat futures a boost at the opening bell.
   But forecasts for precipitation in some U.S. winter wheat areas
kept a lid on those gains and encouraged selling of new-crop wheat
contracts, analysts said.
   Corn and soybeans were little changed in early trading, defying
expectations that soybean futures prices would extend Wednesday's
gains.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents lower to 1{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $4.26} a bushel; corn was
unchanged to \ cent lower with March at $2.71 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to } cent higher with March at $2.09 a bushel; soybeans

   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the

   Live cattle were unchanged to .38 cent higher with April at 75.55

<HEAD>Union Rejects Braniff Contract Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative contract proposal from Braniff Inc. has
been rejected by the Teamsters union local representing company
employees, officials said today.
   The Braniff proposal, including some provisions for 11 percent
raises in the first year, was rejected by Teamsters local no. 19 by
a vote of 1,058 to 242, union officials said.
   Tom Burnette, local president, said about 70 percent of the
estimated 2,000 union members cast ballots in the election.
   Main opposition to the contract came in the way raises would be
phased in among workers with different experience levels, he said.
   Teamsters and Braniff officials said they would return to the
bargaining table. The contract, dating from 1983, became amendable
last Dec. 1.
   Voting began in late January after Braniff and union officials
said they had reached a tentative agreement.
   Braniff's baggage handlers, ticket and reservations agents and
clerical and office workers are represented by the Teamsters.
   Either the airline or the union, under the Federal Railway Labor
Act, can request federal mediation if the contract dispute isn't
resolved.
   Braniff was acquired by investors last summer, shifted most of
its flight operations to Kansas City and began trying to attract
more business travelers by increasing its daily departure schedules.
It recently ordered more than $2 billion worth of new airplanes.
   The airline announced last week that it will move its
headquarters from Dallas to Orlando, Fla., and expand support
facilities in Orlando and in Kansas City to the tune of $40 million
and 1,400 jobs in the next year.
   Braniff's labor costs average $1.15 per available seat mile, the
lowest of any large U.S. airline, according to the Department of
Transportation. By contrast, American Airlines' labor costs average
$2.64 per available seat mile.
   Braniff's Teamsters took pay cuts of about 30 percent after the
airline emerged from bankruptcy under new ownership in 1983.
   The airline also faces contract talks with the unions
representing pilots, flight attendants and dispatchers at Braniff.
Officials said all three contracts become amendable on March 1.
   Braniff has more than 4,000 employees, including 440 pilots.
   The Philadelphia-based investor group controlling Braniff is
CoreGroup, headed by Jeffrey R. Chodorow and Arthur Cohen.

   The stock market forged ahead today, extending
Wednesday's rally as interest rates declined.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 22.68 points on
Wednesday, rose 11.25 to 2,315.18 by noontime today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 741 up, 476
down and 587 unchanged.
   The dollar rose against leading overseas currencies in
foreign-exchange trading.
   That helped prompt a slight increase in bond prices, and decline
in interest rates, in the domestic credit markets.
   Enthusiasm for stocks did not seem to be dampened much by worries
about the monthly report due out Friday on the country's
international trade balance.
   Wall Street economists generally expect the figures to show about
a $12 billion trade deficit for December, compared with the $12.5
billion gap between imports and exports previously reported for
November.
   Church's Fried Chicken led the active list, up 1[ at 10[. The
company agreed to be acquired by A. Copeland Enterprises for $11 a
share in cash and securities.
   Merck rose 1[ to 64~ in active trading following word that
researchers at the company have found what they describe as a
promising approach toward combating the virus that causes AIDS.
   Ford Motor added [ to 54\. The company reported fourth quarter
earnings of $2.42 a share, up from $1.87 in the like period a year
earlier.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Union Carbide, up {
at 33; DuPont, up { at 98\; American Express, up \ at 31[, and
Philip Morris, up 2 at 110{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.40 to 165.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .17 at 325.19.

   Ford Motor Co. today said it earned $1.16 billion
during the final three months of last year and $5.3 billion for all
of 1988, outearning much larger General Motors Corp. for the third
straight year.
   The quarterly earnings were up 24.2 percent from 1987's fourth
quarter. Annual earnings for the nation's No. 2 automaker rose 14.5
percent over the $4.63 billion Ford earned in 1987.
   General Motors Corp. reported Tuesday it earned $4.86 billion in
1988, and Chrysler reported earlier that it made $1.05 billion last
year. Ford's earnings pushed 1988 profits for the Big Three to
$11.21 billion, breaking the companies' combined annual earnings
record of $9.79 billion set in 1984.
   Ford's fourth-quarter earnings, which worked out to $2.42 a
share, came on sales of $23.91 billion. During the same period last
year, Ford earned $932 million, or $1.87 a share, on sales of $20.99
billion.
   For the year, earnings came to $10.96 a share, compared with
$9.05 a share on profits of $4.63 billion in 1987. Sales for 1988
were $92.45 billion, compared with $79.89 billion the year before,
an increase of 15.7 percent.
   Ford's fourth-quarter earnings set a company record for profits
during the last three months of any year, and extended to 11 the
number of three-month periods that Ford has had record quarterly
profits.
   Ford said earnings for its financial services fell 19.4 percent,
to $691 million last year from $857 million in 1987. The decline was
paced by lower interest profits and higher credit losses.
   The company's overseas automotive operations set an annual
earnings record, contributing $2.1 billion to the overall profit
figure. Increased earnings were reported in Europe, Asia and Latin
America, as Ford more than doubled its 1987 overseas profits.
   Earnings in its U.S. automotive operations last year amounted to
$2.5 billion, down 9.1 percent from the $2.7 billion Ford earned in
the United States in 1987. The company said higher product and
marketing costs last year more than offset profits from higher car
market share and strong sales.
   Ford Treasurer and Vice President for Finance David McCammon said
he expects Ford to issue profit-sharing checks of between $2,100 and
$3,700 to hourly workers. Ford said it would announce profit sharing
Friday. Last year, the company issued $635 million in profit-sharing
checks, about $3,700 per employee.
   GM said Tuesday it would issue profit-sharing checks of about
$254 for each of its 470,000 eligible employees. Chrysler said it
would distribute about $720 apiece in profit sharing to its
employees.

<TEXT>
   A group of Coleman Co. shareholders have
filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Coleman family from acquiring
the publicly held corporation.
   In the action filed Wednesday in Sedgwick County District Court,
the stockholders held the $64 per share offer made by the family was
not enough.
   Coleman closed at $71 Wednesday, up 87{ cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange as more than 672,00 shares changed hands. In early
trading today it was down 62{ cents to $70.37{.
   Some analysts said Wednesday there was nearly a $50 million gap
between what the stock was trading for and the Coleman family's
offer.
   The suit calls the offer ``grossly inadequate.''
   Fred Anschel, an analyst who follows Coleman for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said such suits are routine.
   He also said it probably would take a week for other bidders for
the company to step forward, if there are going to be any.
   No date was set for a hearing in the suit filed by Airmont Plaza
Associates, Charles Miller, William Steiner and Katherine Reilly.
The petition asks that the lawsuit be declared a class action on
behalf of all Coleman stockholders. The attorney who filed it, Roger
Sherwood of Wichita, refused comment.
   ``We believe the suits to be without merit but can comment no
further, other than to say that such suits are common following an
announcement of a potential acquoisition of this type,'' said
Sheldon C. Coleman, company board chairman and the family member
leading the leveraged buyout bid.
   Sheldon C. Coleman announced Wednesday he had received bank
funding assurances for the $332 million leveraged buyout.
   He said Wednesday he and other family members have formed Chatham
Acquisition Corp. and retained Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. as financial
adviser.
   The company said Chatham has received a commitment letter from
First National Bank of Chicago for up to $415 million.
   A special committee of Coleman's board is considering the buyout
offer. The committee is made up of outside directors _ board members
who aren't Coleman family members or company officers.

<HEAD>Two Plead Innocent In Alleged Multimillion Dollar Tax Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York financier and a Florida businessman
pleaded innocent Thursday to a massive tax fraud scam in which they
allegedly faked more than $38 billion in trades in U.S. government
securities.
   Jon Edelman, 43, of Rye, and Bernhard F. Manko, 48, of Lighthouse
Point, Fla., were released on $500,000 bonds after appearing before
U.S. Magistrate Leonard Bernikow.
   Edelman is the brother of prominent Wall Street takeover
strategist Asher Edelman, who was not implicated in the alleged
scheme said to involve $511 million in illegal tax writeoffs.
   Jon Edelman and Manko were charged with conspiracy to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service and numerous counts of making false
statements to the IRS or aiding others to do so.
   A hearing to determine a trial date in the case, which the
government said is at least as large as any previous one of its
type, was set for Feb. 24 before U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson
Lowe.
   Edelman and Manko surrendered their passports and were barred
from leaving the continental United States.
   They were indicted last week. Authorities said investors,
including billionaire John Kluge, chairman of Metromedia Corp., and
the late fashion designer Perry Ellis, were unwitting participants
in the scheme and aren't under investigation.
   Jon Edelman and Manko were accused of creating more than $38
billion in ``pre-arranged, rigged and fraudulent'' transactions in
government securities to generate losses for investors in numerous
limited partnerships, which the investors could write off against
their taxes.
   The scheme involved at least 15 partnerships between 1982 and
1986, the indictment said.
   Both Manko and Edelman were charged with conspiracy, which
carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000
fine. Manko was charged with 24 false statement counts and Edelman
was charged with 25 similar counts, each of which carries up to
three years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

<HEAD>Perlman Mulls Options to Stop Control Data Losses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawrence Perlman, president and chief
operating officer of Control Data Corp., says he has ``not ruled out
any options'' for cutting the company's losses, including the sale
of part or all of the computer business.
   But Perlman said Wednesday that options under consideration also
include seeking equity partners to help turn around the computer
business, which had operating losses of about $130 million last year.
   His comments came in response to a question during an interview
about widespread rumors that Control Data is about to sell its
computer operations. Unisys Corp. has been mentioned most often as
the buyer.
   ``It's too early to tell if we have to sell portions of the
computer business,'' said Perlman, dismissing published reports that
Unisys representatives recently visited the St. Paul assembly plant
of Control Data's ETA supercomputer subsidiary.
   ``We have Unisys and every other (computer) manufacturer visiting
ETA,'' said Perlman, who was named to his current posts in December.
``We're trying to sell them on ETA as a compatible supercomputer
with their mainframes.''
   Perlman would prefer to keep the computer business more or less
intact, but he acknowledged that there's ``no question that one of
the ways to help make computers profitable is to find the right kind
of partner.
   ``We don't have to own all of ETA or the Cyber group (Control
Data's mainframe computer business) for that matter.''

   Stock prices fell Thursday amid continued concern
about the outlook for world interest rates as traders sat back to
await Friday's release of British inflation figures.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 10.2 points at
1,667.2 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 5.53

   Volume rose to 644.1 million shares from Wednesday's 468.5

   Prices were hit early as several British brokerage firms
conducted large program trades, dealers said. But a mostly apathetic
market failed to reignite much movement upward from depressed levels.
   ``The (program trades) took the fire out of the market,'' one
dealer said.
   There wasn't any noticeable relief after the West German
Bundesbank failed to raise interest rates at a meeting Thursday, as
many players had expected. Instead, it merely perpetuated the
market's uncertainty about whether worldwide rates were headed
higher, dealers said.
   ``The feeling is that the U.S. will increase their rates
anyway,'' said one equity salesman.
   Players eagerly awaited Friday's release of Britain's retail
price index, which could bear on the outlook for British rates. The
annual inflation rate is expected to have risen to 7.3 percent in
January from 6.8 percent in December.

<TEXT>
   British Aerospace (Dynamics) Ltd., a guided weapons
manufacturing subsidiary of British Aerospace PLC, will cut 2,500
jobs by the end of the 1990s and close two of its six major sites,
the company said Thursday.
   British Aerospace said an internal review had concluded that the
cuts in its workforce of 13,500 and the shutting down of some sites
were necessary to improve efficiency.
   ``We currently have a wasteful duplication of facilities and
resources which, when consolidated and rationalized, will improve
utilization and efficiency,'' the company said in a statement.
   ``The measures we are taking are designed solely to protect our
(guided weapons) business over the next decade and beyond,'' said
British Aerospace Chairman Richard Evans in a brief separate
statement.
   A union representing workers at the London-based company, the
Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union, described the planned job
cuts as an ``outrage.''
   The British Aerospace statement said the company would ``consult
and discuss with employees and their representatives the various
methods'' of implementing the reductions.
   The company said it would close manufacturing sites at Bracknell,
northwest of London and Bolton in central England, as well as
closing a small guided weapons plant in Hatfield, on the northern
outskirts of London.

<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. on Thursday
unveiled what it called the world's fastest memory chip, one capable
of sending and receiving more than 6 billion bits of data per second.
   IBM said the static random access memory (SRAM) chip was for fast
machines such as mainframes and supercomputers that need to store
information in memory banks and retrieve it at high speeds.
   The chip was discussed in New York at the International Solid
State Circuits Conference, the world chip industry's biggest annual
research meeting. A day earlier, Intel Corp. unveiled what it called
the world's fastest microprocessor, the central control chip in a
computer.
   IBM said its chip can store 128,000 bits of information and has
features as small as half a micron across. One micron is
one-hundredth the width of a human hair.
   On Wednesday at the conference, Texas Instruments Inc. announced
an SRAM chip that is slightly slower but holds eight times as much
information.
   SRAM chips are faster but more expensive and have less capacity
than the more common memory chips known as dynamic random access
memories, or DRAMs.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition lawmakers charged Thursday that former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone played a key role in a widening
scandal over bargain stock deals offered to political and business
leaders.
   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary general of the opposition socialists,
demanded that Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's government summon
Nakasone for questioning by a parliamentary committee.
   He alleged Nakasone provided Recruit Co., at the center of the
scandal, with special favors by ordering Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Co. and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to
buy supercomputers from the United States for use by Recruit.
   In reply to Yamaguchi's questions in Parliament, Minoru Shioya, a
telecommunications ministry official, said Nakasone asked the
ministry to help solve trade frictions with the United States but
gave no specific orders. The United States has pressed Japan to buy
more American supercomputers.
   Takeshita said a separate committee would decide whether to
summon Nakasone, who was prime minister from 1982 to 1987.
   Two of Nakasone's secretaries were among 150 influential
politicians and businessmen offered bargain stock in a Recruit
subsidiary, Recruit-Cosmos, before public trading of company shares
began. The stock price later soared.
   In arresting two Recruit officials and two Nippon Telegraph
officials on Monday, prosecutors noted a Supreme Court ruling that
non-public offers of stock expected to rise in price amounted to
bribery.
   Two other Recruit officials were arrested Wednesday for allegedly
violating securities laws. Another was arrested last year for
allegedly trying to bribe an opposition member of Parliament to
defuse an investigation of Recruit, an information services
conglomerate.
   Two U.S.-made supercomputers bought by Nippon Telegraph were
resold to Recruit but kept on NTT premises and maintained by NTT
though operated by Recruit. Opposition lawmakers are questioning the
terms of the arrangement.
   Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi charged that sale of
Recruit-Cosmos shares was ``centered around key figures in the
Nakasone administration'' and that Nakasone was involved in a
supercomputer deal between Cray Research Inc. of the United States
and the Japansese firms.
   She also said Nakasone personally recommended Recruit founder and
former chairman Hiromasa Ezoe, who was among those arrested Monday,
for a spot on government committees during.
   Another opposition lawmaker, Yanosuke Narazaki of the United
Social Democratic Party, said Nakasone's role is essential in
unraveling the scandal.
   ``It is so clear that the scandal was centered around Mr.
Nakasone and key members in his administration,'' Narazaki said.
   Ten politicians who served in Nakasone's cabinet are among those
linked to bargain Recruit share purchases, including Takeshita.
   Narazaki said his party and the Democratic Socialist Party will
join the Socialists, the main opposition, in demanding that Nakasone
be summoned for questioning.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended higher against major foreign
currencies Thursday but below its best levels in dull European
trading.
   Gold prices rose slightly.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar climbed to around 1.8500
West German marks after the Bundesbank announced it would not be
raising its key interest rates amid expectations a rate hike would
be announced.
   But the market lacked the energy to push the dollar through the
1.8500-mark level, and the U.S. currency drifted back to its late
levels.
   ``People have chased the dollar higher and lower a few times this
week and are obviously tired of it,'' said one dealer, who said the
market was awaiting the release of U.S. trade figures Friday.
   Dealers said trade figures released over the past few months
haven't had the same impact on the market as last year.
   But the dollar's inability to respond to any good news this week,
together with the fact that the long-awaited hike in the U.S.
discount rate has failed to materialize, may mean the trade figures
will have an exaggerated impact on the dollar.
   Economists are expecting a U.S. December deficit of $11.7
billion, narrower than November's $12.5 billion gap.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7712 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7805 Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.8425 West German marks, up from 1.8315
   _1.5643 Swiss francs, up from 1.5565
   _6.2725 French francs, up from 6.2425
   _2.0790 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0680
   _1,348.50 Italian lire, up from 1,339.50
   _1.1859 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1800
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,

<HEAD>Wheat, Soybeans Plunge In Late Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat and soybean futures prices closed sharply
lower Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid a flurry of late
sell orders linked to bearish supply-and-demand factors.
   Corn and oat futures also retreated.
   Wheat market led the decline, with much of the selling sparked by
news that a sale of 1.5 million metric tons of French wheat to the
Soviet Union was expected to proceed smoothly.
   The report disappointed market bulls who had recently bid up
wheat prices on indications that some European grain producers were
running into logistical problems in meeting their sale commitments
to the Soviets.
   ``This latest announcement about the French ... puts an end to
that speculation,'' said Ted Mao, an analyst in New York with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   New studies showing less cold-weather damage to the U.S. winter
wheat crop than many had expected also weighed on the wheat market.
   Reports of improved soybean-growing conditions in South America
contributed to the soybean market's decline.
   At the close, wheat was 2\ cents to 9 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.23 a bushel; corn was } cent to
2} cents lower with March at $2.68{ a bushel; oats were 3\ cents to
4\ cents lower with March at $2.04\ a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents

   Millionaire industrialist Victor Posner,
sentenced to help the homeless instead of going to jail for tax
evasion, on Thursday announced a program by one of his companies to
raise money for the homeless.
   Posner refused to say whether the Royal Crown Cola Co. drive is
related to his tax case, in which he was ordered to give $3 million
to aid the homeless in Florida. An RC executive said the two were
not connected.
   ``We all know this problem exists and discussing it further won't
help to alleviate the sorrow and waste connected with this national
blight, nor will it create shelter or provide food,'' Posner said,
reading from a prepared statement at a news conference.
   Posner, 69, pleaded no contest last year to evading $1.2 million
in federal income taxes by fraudulently inflating the value of land
he donated to a college in the 1970s.
   A federal judge fined Posner $4 million in fines and ordered him
to give $3 million to help Florida's homeless, with the stipulation
that the money not be tax-deductible. The judge appointed a
committee of civic leaders to determine how the money would be spent
for the homeless in Florida.
   ``This is an RC campaign and has nothing to do with Mr. Posner,''
said Carey Keane, vice president of marketing for the cola company,
of which Posner is chairman.
   Keane said the company hopes to raise $1 million, and other
corporations have been invited to join the effort.
   RC said it will donate a portion of the proceeds from sales of
its soft drinks to help the homeless through local organizations.
The money will come from sales in 14 markets around the country.
   Buyers of Royal Crown products in other markets will not be
contributing to the campaign, which ends April 30.
   The cities involved are Miami, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia,
Tucson and Phoenix, Ariz., St. Paul-Minneapolis, Washington, D.C.,
Nashville, Tenn., Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Boston, Detroit and San
Diego.
   Posner, who controls a 40-company empire valued at $4 billion,
last September was named in a Securities and Exchange Commission
civil complaint against the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., which has agreed to pay a record $650 million to settle
criminal charges of securities fraud.
   Posner and his son, Stephen, were accused of shady dealings with
now-jailed Wall Street speculator Ivan Boesky in a takeover deal.
The complaint is pending.

<HEAD>J.C. Penney's Income Up 55 Percent in Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.C. Penney Co. Thursday reported a 55 percent
profit boost for the fourth quarter, aided by a gain from the sale
of the company's former headquarters building and better margins.
   A reduction in promotional activity and declining interest
expense also benefited the big retailer's balance sheet.
   For the 13 weeks ended Jan. 28, after-tax income came to $435
million, or $3.28 per share, compared with $280 million, or $1.93 a
share, for the corresponding quarter a year earlier.
   The earnings included a $139 million gain, after taxes, from the
sale of the company's former headquarters building in New York City.
   Total revenue, including store sales and revenue from its
insurance and realty operations, was $4.95 billionin the company's
fourth quarter, up from $5.05 billion
   Profit for all of 1988 rose 32.7 percent to $807 million, or
$6.02 per share, compared with $608 million, or $4.11 per share, for
the previous year. Revenue for the year amounted to $15.30 billion,
a 2.9 percent dip from 1987's $15.75 billion.
   As of Jan. 28, the company had purchased 8 million shares of
common stock at a cost of $418 million as part of a stock buyback
program of up to 15 million shares authorized this year.
   ``The company is well positioned to respond to consumer buying
patterns in J.C. Penney stores and (the) catalog,'' said company
chairman William R. Howell.
   ``The expansion of women's apparel offerings and the continued
strengthening of men's and children's apparel and home@leisure
merchandise will result in significant opportunities for J.C.
Penney,'' he said.
   In February, the company announced discussions were under way
with several major insurance companies for the sale of personal
lines operations of J.C. Penney Casualty Insurance Co.
   Penney will not have any significant gain or loss in exiting the
casualty insurance business. The company will continue to operate
the J.C. Penney Life Insurance Co., offering life, health and credit
insurance coverage.

<HEAD>Pentagon to Raise Dollar Standard for Reporting Contracts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department, citing the effects of
inflation over the past decade, said Thursday it would soon raise
its dollar standard for reporting contracts to the public and
Congress.
   Effective March 1, the Pentagon said its daily listing of
contract awards would be restricted to contracts worth $5 million or
more.
   The current contract-reporting level is $3 million and was
established in 1978.
   ``The inflation-based adjustment, up from the current $3 million
announcement threshold, is the first to be made in almost 11
years,'' the Pentagon said.
   ``Consequently, the number of contract actions requiring
notification has increased significantly. As a result of inflation
over the intervening years, a contract valued at $3 million in 1978
is now equivalent to a $5.6 million contract today.''
   The Pentagon said the change would have no effect on the manner
in which contracts are awarded or on the number of contracts
awarded. The new standard will keep manageable the contract lists
printed every day for distribution to the media, public and
Congress, the Pentagon said.
   As is the case now, any contract awarded by a defense agency or
service that falls below the threshhold will be publicly announced,
but not on the day of award as happens with the larger contracts.
   Smaller contracts are normally disclosed after a lag of a week or
so in the government publication Commerce Business Daily.
   The Defense Department awards roughly 15 million contracts every
year.

<HEAD>Gillette Reports 5 Percent Fourth-Quarter Earnings Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. said Thursday that fourth-quarter
earnings increased 5.2 percent on sales approaching $1 billion.
   The personal care company reported profits of $61.5 million, or
63 cents a share, on sales of $968 million. That compared with
earnings of $58.3 million, or 51 cents a share, on sales of $866
million for the final quarter of 1987.
   For the full year, Gillette said earnings totaled $269 million,
or $2.45 per share, up 17 percent from $230 million, or $2 per
share, reported for 1987.
   The income was based on a 13 percent increase in sales to $3.58
billion from $3.17 billion in 1987, said Colman M. Mockler Jr.,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   Also Thursday, Gillette's board proposed increasing its annual
dividend rate from 86 cents per share to 96 cents per share.
   The proposed increase marks the 12th consecutive annual increase
in dividends paid to Gillette stockholders, the company said in a
statement. The new quarterly rate would be 24 cents per share
effective with the June 5, 1989, payment.

<HEAD>Wrong TV Picture Prompts Flood of Calls to Healthy S&amp;L</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television news story about troubled savings and
loan associations used film footage of a healthy local S&amp;L,
prompting a flurry of calls from worried depositors, officials said
Thursday.
   ``We got a flood of phone calls, at least two dozen,'' said Jack
Lloyd, a vice president of Savings of America.
   CBS-owned WBBM-TV mentioned debt-ridden First Savings of America
in Orland Park in a report on the Channel 2 News at 5 p.m. Wednesday.
   But the videotape footage showed Savings of America, which is on
the same street in the southwest suburb.
   ``We told the right story and showed the wrong picture. We made a
mistake and we regret it,'' Colleen Dudgeon, WBBM-TV news director
said Thursday.
   ``We ran a correction last night at 10 o'clock and will again at
5 today,'' she said.
   Not only is Savings of America financially healthy, its parent
company, Irwindale, Calif.-based Home Savings of America, has assets
of more than $40 billion, said Lloyd.
   Savings of America received ``a lot of curious calls,'' said
Lloyd. ``The report was at 5 o'clock and we were open another two
hours.''
   Worried callers were told there had been a mistake.
   ``Some heard the other name and were confused because the names
are very close. We tried to allay fears, and those that needed more
convincing were given appointments,'' Lloyd said.
   The S&amp;L chain then braced for a period of reassurances.
   ``We had to mobilize overnight. The executives of the 17 branches
in the Chicago area got together by phone,'' he said. ``We wanted to
address the financial information right away.''
   Anxious depositors coming in Thursday were shown a video of
WBBM's retraction.
   They also were given the S&amp;L's financial reports and copies of
favorable newspaper articles _ including one in USA Today that
quoted a stock analyst as saying Home Savings was the best-managed
thift in the nation, Lloyd said.
   Ms. Dudgeon would not elaborate on how WBBM's error occurred, but
said no disciplinary action was planned.
   Lloyd characterized the television report as ``totally
irresponsible,'' but said that ``at this point, I think no legal
action is going to be necessary.''
   The mix-up could even be a plus for Savings of America, he said.
   ``It will let us show pople how big and how strong we are,''
Lloyd said.
   Five Chicago-area savings and loan associations are on a national
list of financially ailing institutions ripe for takeover by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. under President Bush's plan to
resolve the crisis in the S&amp;L industry.
   Besides First Savings, insolvent thrifts in the Chicago area are:
Concordia Federal Bank for Savings, Lansing; Libertyville Federal
Savings; American Security Federal Savings, Chicago; and Home
Federal Savings, Joliet.
   All depositors at these S&amp;Ls will continue to be insured up to
$100,000 and have normal access to their accounts, FDIC officials
say.

   Assets of the nation's 454 money market mutual
funds rose $1.46 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to a record $289.01 billion in the seven-day period
ended Wednesday, followed a $2.26 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit their previous record high in the week
ended Feb. 8, rising to $287.62 billion.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 224 general purpose funds rose $1.42 billion to $92.3
billion, assets of 93 broker-dealer funds increased $883.9 million
to $123.33 billion, and assets of 137 institutional funds declined
$851.2 million to $73.39 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.44 percent from 8.37 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.39 percent from 8.37 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 31
days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.37 percent as of Wednesday from 6.35 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was 5.14 percent, unchanged from a week earlier.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.48
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.41 the
previous week. Yields were 8.74 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.67
percent; 8.78 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.74 percent; and 8.86
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.81 percent.

   LyphoMed Inc. won nationwide prominence a
few years ago when it become the only licensed maker of a drug used
to fight a deadly pneumonia linked to the AIDS scourge. Since then
the company has been fighting a scourge of its own: quality
complaints, product recalls and plant closures.
   Now LyphoMed is trying to restore customer confidence, a daunting
task in a business where trust is crucial to survival. Company
executives and outside analysts agree any recovery won't be smooth.
   ``The company does have a credibility gap that they have to fill
with the major institutional investor _ not only explaining what
happened, but that it won't happen again,'' said Michael
Harshbarger, an industry analyst at Hayes and Griffith, a Chicago
firm that specializes in health-care investments.
   In 1984, LyphoMed became the only company federally licensed to
make pentamidine, used to combat a pneumonia that frequently kills
people afflicted with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
LyphoMed's success seemed assured.
   Three years later, inspections of LyphoMed plants by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration revealed numerous violations of what
the watchdog agency calls ``good manufacturing practices.''
   Its Grand Island, N.Y., plant still doesn't comply with FDA
standards, and the Chicago and Orlando, Fla., plants have been
closed permanently. But the main plant at Melrose Park, Ill., is
back in compliance and a new plant under construction in Puerto Rico
will replace the Florida operation.
   ``The worst is behind them,'' Harshbarger said.
   In early February LyphoMed reported a $5.8 million fourth-quarter
loss and a 1988 loss of $21.1 million, vs. a $21 million profit in
1987.
   But Harshbarger predicted 1989 ``will be a watershed year ...
from investment, trade, turnaround, and operationally.''
   To strengthen senior management and avoid repeating history,
LyphoMed created five new positions late last year in manufacturing,
quality control, research and development and regulatory affairs.
   With that team, LyphoMed has pledged to adding patented products
to their existing business of injectible drugs for the critically
ill.
   ``When we've come through a situation where the company has
almost been frozen for a year because of the fact that we've been
beset by so many problems ...it's a refreshing feeling for everybody
to get going again,'' said Gary Nei, who's leading LyphoMed's
revitalization plans.
   Nei, 44, a veteran health-care industry executive who formerly
worked at American Hospital Supply Corp., was hired in the fall for
the newly created position of president and chief operating officer.
   His job, Nei said, is to ``bring a more disciplined and
controlled environment to the corporation and, one at a time, begin
to set aside the things that have plagued the company.''
   The first challenge is restoring customer confidence and sales,
which plunged by about 50 percent last year.
   LyphoMed officials decline to say how many clients have taken
their business elsewhere, but Nei acknowledged in a recent interview
that the FDA scrutiny ``certainly led to a significant
disappointment on the part of a lot of pharmacists.
   ``But the fact is,'' he said, ``the company grew at (such) a
rate...that we were unable to provide the necessary people and
systems to control our quality systems in the face of that growth.''
   Annual sales totaled $4 million in 1981, when LyphoMed was
acquired from Stone Container Corp. in a management-led takeover by
John Kapoor, chairman and chief executive officer. In 1987 sales
totaled $172 million, reflecting LyphoMed's success in selling drugs
to large hospitals at attractive prices.
   The surge laid the foundation for trouble. Among the main
problems were these:
   _An FDA inspection report in July 1987 on the firm's Melrose Park
plant that cited improper drug-testing procedures and inadequate
employee training or supervision.
   _A November 1987 FDA letter that cited ``serious violations'' of
federal law, including release of under-filled vials of drugs and
failure to follow up on indications of contamination of several
drugs, including pentamidine.
   _A November 1987 FDA suspension of LyphoMed's applications to
market new drugs until quality-control problems were corrected.
   _A January 1988 company recall of amphotericin B, an antibiotic
used on fungal infections, after patient complaints of high fever
and chills.
   _A March 1988 FDA report on a three-month inspection at the
Melrose Park plant that listed 44 violations of ``good manufacturing
practices,'' similar to problems disclosed in the November 1987
letter.
   _A June 1988 suspension of LyphoMed's Florida plant operations to
correct quality-control problems found by the FDA.
   Finally this past September under FDA orders, LyphoMed agreed to
destroy or clean up hundreds of thousands of contaminated injectable
drugs seized by federal authorities. It also agreed to recall some
drugs that were distributed, including heparin, ascorbic acid and
potassium chloride, which is commonly given to hospitalized patients
with congestive heart failure.
   ``The firm had bad problems,'' said an FDA official who requested
anonymity. ``Out of the 100 violations we dealt with in fiscal 1987
... LyphoMed's were among the most serious...but it was not unique.''
   Important clients spooked off by LyphoMed's travails included
University Hospital Consortium, a pharmaceutical-buying group for 48
university hospitals nationwide.
   The group disapproved LyphoMed as a vendor about a year ago, and
its pharmacy advisory committee voted in December ``not to reinstate
LyphoMed as an approved vendor through 1989,'' said Karen Packard,
vice president of planning and marketing for the Oak Brook Terrace,
Ill.-based consortium.
   ``We were not convinced that LyphoMed could be a consistent
supplier of products'' of assured quality, she said in a phone
interview. But she said the consortium may restore its relationship
with LyphoMed eventually.
   ``We would like to have them be reapproved because they provide a
product that is not readily available,'' she said, referring to
pentamidine.
   Nei said LyphoMed is trying to convey the message that the
company has reformed, and ``we're certainly sorry over some of the
inconvenience that we've caused some of our customers.''

<HEAD>Brazilian President Calls Debt Payments `Intolerable'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Sarney said Brazil doesn't
have the money to pay its foreign debt due in March and called the
debt burden ``intolerable.''
   In a message to the opening session of Congress Wednesday, Sarney
said Brazil has paid back $55 billion in interest since 1985, but
the total amount it owes hasn't changed.
   Sarney will meet with President Bush in Tokyo this month to
discuss new solutions to the debt problem, the Foreign Ministry said.
   Brazil's foreign debt is $115 billion, the largest in the Third
World. The government says debt payments this year will total
between $12 billion and $14 billion.
   ``The country cannot go on being an exporter of capital to the
rich countries,'' Sarney said.
   ``We have normalized our accounts with international creditors,
but the total of the debt and its respective servicing still
constitute a serious restriction to our economy's development.''
   Sarney said Brazil doesn't have enough money in its reserves to
pay $1.3 billion due in March to commercial banks and the
International Monetary Fund.
   He called a recent agreement to reschedule debt payments ``a step
forward,'' but added that it ``cannot be considered a definitive
solution.''
   The $82 billion agreement calls for the rescheduling over 20
years of debt due between 1987 and 1993, lower interest rates and
$5.2 billion in new loans.
   Brazil has insisted that new ideas are needed to reduce the Latin
American debt, estimated at more than $400 billion.
   ``It is fundamental to insist on the political responsibility of
the industrialized countries for the creation of institutional
mechanisms that permit a quick and definitive lowering of the
debt,'' Sarney said.
   The debt will be on the agenda of a private meeting between Bush
and Sarney when the presidents attend the funeral of Japanese
Emperor Hirohito in Tokyo this month, the Foreign Ministry said.
   Sarney also will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Noburo
Takeshita to discuss the release of $600 million in credits by the
Japanese government, according to the ministry.
   Brazil is counting on the Japanese loan, plus $500 million from
the World Bank and $600 million from commercial banks to meet its
debt obligations this year.
   The Finance Ministry has warned that Brazil could again suspend
debt payments _ as it did in 1987 _ if its cash reserves fall too
low.
   However, the level of Brazil's reserves depends largely on the
success of a radical anti-inflation plan announced last month.
   The plan aimed at curbing 1,000 percent inflation includes a
freeze on wages and prices and sharp cuts in government spending.
   On Wednesday night, Sarney went on nationwide television and
radio and said the plan was working, despite growing signs of labor
unrest.
   He said ``the specter of hyperinflation has been halted and price
increases in February will be minimal.''
   However, the president warned that ``a mania for striking'' could
bring instability to the 4-year-old civilian regime. Until 1985,
Brazil was ruled for 21 years by a right-wing military government.
   Labor unions have called for a national strike on March 14 and 15
to protest the end of cost-of-living raises under the anti-inflation
plan.

<HEAD>Ford Profit Up 24.4 Percent In Quarter, 14.5 Percent In Record Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. on Thursday posted a 24.4
percent rise in its fourth quarter earnings and record annual
profits, as results in its overseas business overshadowed a decline
in its U.S. automotive earnings.
   Ford reported a fourth quarter profit of $1.16 billion, or $2.42
a share, compared with $932 million, or $1.87 a share, in the same
period of 1987. Revenue during the quarter rose to $23.91 billion
from $20.99 billion a year earlier.
   Annual profits rose to an industry-record $5.3 billion, or $10.96
a share, on revenue of $92.45 billion. In 1987, the nation's No. 2
automaker made $4.63 billion, or $9.05 a share, on revenue of $79.9
billion.
   ``We're particularly pleased with our overseas performance and
with our U.S. car market share,'' said David McCammon, Ford's vice
president for finance and treasurer.
   Ford's share of the U.S. automobile market climbed to 21.7
percent in 1988, its highest in 10 years and up 1.7 points from 1987.
   During the year, Ford's earnings in the United States slipped 9.1
percent to $2.5 billion from $2.75 billion in 1987, while overseas
profits rose to $2.1 billion from 1987's $1 billion.
   McCammon said U.S. profits partly declined because of a lopsided
mix of vehicles the company had available, mainly caused by
lower-than-anticipated production of Thunderbird and Cougar cars.
Ford also blamed higher marketing costs, including sales incentives,
and increased factory costs.
   Profits in Ford's financial operations, including its lending
business, fell 19.4 percent in 1988 from 1987, the automaker also
reported.
   The sag in U.S. performance means Ford's workers won't receive as
much in their profit-sharing checks this year as they did last year,
when a typical employee got $3,700.
   McCammon said profit-sharing figures would be announced Friday to
Ford employees via closed-circuit television, and would be the
second-highest in company history. That means the checks will be
less than last year's but more than the $2,100 each worker received
in 1986.
   General Motors Corp., which reported its earnings Tuesday, said
it would issue profit-sharing checks of about $254 to each employee.
Chrysler Corp. said earlier this month its workers would receive
about $720 apiece.
   Together, the Big Three reported 1988 earnings of $11.21 billion,
topping the previous annual profit record of $9.79 billion in 1984.
   But analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New
York said the Big Three's earnings were boosted by inflation and
accounting changes.
   Ford's McCammon said the cost of sales incentives, used to lure
customers into showrooms, rose by about $400 million in 1988 over
1987, but he declined to say how much the company spent on
incentives.
   McCammon said and decline in Ford's financial operations profits
stemmed from a shrinking margin between the rate at which Ford
loaned money and the rate at which it borrows and partly because of
an increasing number of bad loans.
   A trend toward longer car loans, up to five years, tends to
increase odds of the loan turning sour, he said. About half of the
loans that Ford handles are for five years.
   McCammon also said no further financial acquisitions are
anticipated for First Nationwide Bank, a San Francisco-based savings
and loan institution wholly-owned by Ford. But McCammon said that
with $9.2 billion in cash available, Ford still was looking for some
kind of acquisition.

<HEAD>Church's, Popeyes Agree On Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church's Fried Chicken Inc., running
out of time and courtroom manuevers to prevent a takeover by Popeyes
Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits, has agreed to be bought by its
rival for about $330 million.
   Church's, the nation's second-largest fried chicken restaurant
chain and Popeyes, the No. 3 chain, agreed late Wednesday on a
buyout, ending a four-month dispute that saw Church's take Popeyes
to court, sell 120 unprofitable restaurants and put itself up for
auction to avoid the hostile takeover.
   The agreement calls for Popeyes owner Al Copeland to purchase up
to 30.1 million shares, or about 86.5 percent of Church's
outstanding shares, for $11 per share.
   Each share of Church's stock not purchased in the tender offer
will be converted to 0.44 share of a new series of preferred stock
to be issued by the corporation that survives the merger. The
statement did not say what the new company would be called.
   Church's stock closed at $10.25 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading Thursday, up $1.25 a share.
   Popeyes previously had offered about $290 million to take over
the ailing Church's, whose sales have been declining over the past
three years.
   The companies said the agreement, reached four days before
Popeyes' tender offer deadline, came about amicably.
   ``I am pleased that we have agreed to this merger and believe it
will create a very strong No. 2 fast food fried chicken chain,''
Church's president and chief executive officer Ernest Renaud said in
a statement.
   The companies' statement said that Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce has offered to provide up to $300 million and Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. has offered up to $178 million in financing for the tender
offer.
   Neither Renaud nor Copeland immediately returned telephone
messages Thursday to The Associated Press.
   It was not known how many jobs might be lost as a result of the
merger.
   In documents submitted to a federal court during the takeover
process, Popeyes said that if it acquired Church's it would close
250 Church's restaurants, keep 92 with the Church's name, rename 303
others as Popeyes and sell 440 others for about $160 million over
the next four years.
   Popeyes, with 703 restaurants, had been attempting since November
to take over Church's, a publicly held company with 1,478
restaurants.
   Even with a merger, the new company would lag behind No. 1.
Kentucky Fried Chicken, which is owned by PepsiCo Inc., and which
has annual sales of about $4 billion in its 7,000 restaurants.
   Church's, founded in 1952 by George Church Sr., had grown
steadily over the years, but internal bickering, including a
leveraged buyout attempt, and other management and marketing
problems the last several years began taking its toll on the company.
   Church's sales have gone down steadily, from $639 million in
fiscal year 1985 to $577 in 1986 and $533 in 1987. Popeyes,
meanwhile, started by Copeland 15 years ago, is expected to have
sales about $480 million this year.
   During the takeover attempt, Church's sued Popeyes, arguing that
former Church's executives working for Popeyes took with them
information that was used in the buyout proposal. Church's also
adopted a ``poison pill'' takeover defense that would make it more
difficult to carry out a hostile takeover.
   Federal judges in San Antonio and New Orleans had sided with
Popeyes.

   Stock prices nudged ahead Thursday as traders
awaited the monthly report Friday on the nation's international
trade position.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.50 to 2,311.43, on
top of a 22.68-point gain Wednesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
816 up, 591 down and 553 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 177.45 million
shares, up from 154.22 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 207.84 million shares.
   The dollar rose against leading overseas currencies in early
foreign-exchange trading.
   That helped prompt a slight increase in bond prices, and decline
in interest rates, in the domestic credit markets.
   But buying interest in the dollar, bonds and stocks waned a bit
as the session passed, apparently because of worries about the
monthly trade report due out Friday.
   Wall Street economists generally expect the figures to show about
a $12 billion trade deficit for December, compared with the $12.5
billion gap between imports and exports previously reported for
November.
   Church's Fried Chicken climbed 1\ to 10\ in active trading. The
company agreed to be acquired by A. Copeland Enterprises for $11 a
share in cash and securities.
   Merck rose 1 to 64} following word that researchers at the
company have found what they describe as a promising approach toward
combating the virus that causes AIDS.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 2\
at 110}; DuPont, up [ at 97~; Procter &amp; Gamble, up { at 91[; Eastman
Kodak, up \ at 47|, and Coca-Cola, up ] at 48.
   Coca-Cola raised its quarterly dividend from 30 cents a share to
34 cents a share.
   Bank of New York rose | to 42, hitting a 52-week high. The
company said it expects annual earnings growth of 15 percent to 20
percent through 1991, somewhat more than its historical targets.
   Navistar International held steady at 6[. The company posted
profits for its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31 of 12 cents a
share, against 15 cents a share in the comparable period a year
earlier.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $6.29 billion, or 0.22
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.30 to 165.51.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .61 to 340.45, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .57 at 294.81.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market picked
up 1.53 to 405.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 325.15, up .13.

<HEAD>Talk of Mexican Buying Propels Sugar Futures To Year's High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar futures prices rocketed to new 1989 highs Thursday on
rumors that Mexico, historically a net exporter of sugar, had
purchased 400,000 tons of refined white sugar on world markets
because of a domestic shortage.
   The Mexican government later denied the rumors, which had
triggered massive buying of sugar futures on both New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange and the London Futures and Options Exchange.
   On other markets, grain and soybean prices tumbled over concern
that supply exceeded demand; livestock and meat were mixed; energy
futures gained; and precious metals retreated.
   New York sugar futures settled .39 cent to .49 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in March at 10.97 cents a pound, it's
highest settlement price since Dec. 30. March sugar traded as high
as 11 cents a pound during the session.
   Mexico had been rumored earlier in the week to have purchased
75,000 metric tons of sugar from the French trade house Sucres et
Denrees. Even so, Thursday's reports of larger-scale buying took
traders by surprise.
   Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York, said the rumors incited heavy buying of sugar
contracts by futures speculators.
   Trading volume in New York soared to 40,000 contracts, compared
with about 30,000 on Wednesday and 23,000 on Tuesday.
   Analysts said Mexico may have overextended itself on export
commitments and needed to replenish supplies for its own use.
   Wheat led the late decline in grain and soybean futures on the
Chicago Board of Trade, with much of the selling based on news that
a sale of 1.5 million metric tons of French wheat to the Soviet
Union was expected to proceed smoothly.
   The report disappointed market participants who had recently bid
up wheat prices on indications that some European grain producers
were running into logistical problems in meeting their sale
commitments to the Soviets.
   Wheat settled 2} cents to 9 cents lower with March at $4.22{ a
bushel; corn was } cent to 2} cents lower with March at $2.69 a
bushel; oats were 3\ cents to 4\ cents lower with March at $2.04\ a
bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 11\ cents lower with March at
$7.27\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in cautious trading ahead of an Agriculture Department
report on the number of cattle on feedlots in the seven largest
cattle-producing states.
   The report, issued after the close, showed 7.7 million head of
cattle on feed as of Feb. 1, a 2 percent reduction from a year ago.
   The report also showed a 5 percent decline in marketings of
cattle off of feedlots last month and a 3 percent increase in the
number of cattle placed on feedlots during January.
   The USDA figures were all within the trade's expectations, so
analysts said the report would have little impact on livestock
futures prices on Friday.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .33 cent higher with April at
75.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with March at 81.72 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent lower
to .08 cent higher with April at 41.97 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.40 cents lower to .58 cent higher with March at 37.90
cents a pound.
   Energy futures finished higher in a day of seesaw trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 30 cents
higher with March at $18.33 a barrel; heating oil was unchanged to
.91 cent higher with March at 49.65 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .24 cent to 1.10 cents higher with March at 49.05 cents
a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures slipped lower in dull trading on New
York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled $1 to $1.10 lower with April at $387.10 a troy
ounce; silver settled 1 cent to 1.1 cents lower with March at $5.895
a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Legal Mistake Hampers Patent Claim Against Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An apparent oversight in drafting a legal
settlement could cost Hughes Aircraft Co. $270 million in potential
damage payments from the federal government in a long-running patent
infringement suit, a published report said Thursday.
   The error was identified in a ruling by U.S. Claims Court Judge
William Turner, who said Hughes' lawyers made a mistake in a 1987
out-of-court settlement in a related patent case.
   The ruling, issued Sept. 29, was published recently in U.S.
Patent Quarterly. It was first reported in the general news media
Thursday in the Los Angeles Times.
   The case involves an 18-year-long patent infringement case
pursued by Hughes, now a subsidiary of General Motors Corp.,
involving a device used to control orbiting satellites. Hughes
maintains the device made the modern communications satellite
network possible and claims the government used the device on 108
satellites without paying royalties.
   In the case, which presently is in the penalty-setting phase,
Hughes seeks $3.16 billion in damages, based on 15 percent royalties
plus compensation for delay in payment.
   Turner's ruling released the government from liability connected
with 13 government satellites built by Ford Aerospace, a unit of
Ford Motor Co. which Hughes sued for infringement of the same patent.
   The ruling was based on wording of a September 1987 settlement of
the Hughes suit against Ford that absolves Ford customers from
further liability, the Times said. The government was a Ford
customer.
   Turner said Hughes could have prevented the exclusion of the 13
satellites from the total by adding ``except the United States''
after the wording releasing Ford customers from liability.
   Ford agreed to pay Hughes $75 million in the 1987 settlement, the
Times said, quoting unidentified sources.
   John Walker, managing partner at Latham &amp; Watkins, the law firm
representing Hughes in the case, denied the Los Angeles firm erred
in drafting the settlement.
   ``Everything I know is that we didn't make a mistake at all in
the case,'' Walker told the Times.
   Hughes officials refused to comment because the matter concerned
litigation, according to Mike Murphy, a spokesman at the company's
corporate headquarters, said Thursday.
   The company has asked the judge to reconsider the ruling.
   Hughes values its royalties and penalties on the 13 satellites in
the disputed ruling at $270 million, but the government puts the
potential payment to the company at $50 million, the Times reported,
citing secret court filings.
   The patented device was invented in the early 1960s by Donald
Williams, a Hughes engineer.
   The device allows a single small rocket motor to control the
orbit of a spinning satellite by employing gyroscopic principles.
Hughes claims the invention made possible the creation of practical
communicatins satellites, today a multibillion-dollar industry.
   The government contends Hughes has overblown its claims and that
it doesn't possess a valid patent.
   In two previous stages of the case, federal courts have held the
Los Angeles-based aerospace company has a valid claim to a patent on
the device and that the government infringed on that patent. The
present phase is to set the penalty against the government.

   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd. has agreed to
buy the half-interest held by the French publisher Hachette Group in
their 50-50 joint venture that publishes Premiere magazine, the
companies said Thursday.
   Terms were not disclosed. The sale is subject to federal
regulatory approval.
   Premiere was launched 18 months ago to cover all aspects of the
movie business for general readers and has a circulation of more
than 400,000.
   The deal comes about 3{ months after Murdoch's company completed
the sale to Hachette of its half-interest in their Elle fashion
magazine joint ventures in the United States and the United Kingdom.
Terms of that deal were also not disclosed, but the price was
reportedly about $150 million.
   News Corp's half-interest in the Premiere magazine venture is
held by its News America Publishing Inc., which publishes newspapers
and magazines and has filmed entertainment and television operations
in the United States.
   Hachette controls its stake in Premiere magazine through Hachette
Publications Inc., whose main business is publishing magazines in
the United States.

<TEXT>
   A bankruptcy court judge Thursday delayed a
decision on whether to allow an Ohio liquidator to sell 4,700 of
Yugo America Inc.'s unsold cars, nearly a third of the stock of the
bankrupt Yugoslav carmaker.
   Impex Car Corp., the American agent for Yugo, and the liquidator,
Norauto Ltd of Columbus, Ohio, battled this week over control of the
autos.
   Yugo and Impex argue that a deal last fall with Norauto
represented a financing arrangement to bail out the financially
ailing company. Norauto insists it bought the cars outright and
should be allowed to sell them.
   Company officials claim that unloading the autos at
below-wholesale prices without warranties would destroy the market
for Yugos.
   Yugo, based in Upper Saddle River, on Jan. 30 filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Vincent J. Commisa has temporarily
barred the sale of the cars. He said he would rule next week on
whether the ban should continue after boths sides present further
court papers.
   The prospects of reorganizing Yugo would be ``very likely
eliminated'' if the restraint was lifted, Impex attorney Robert A.
Baime said in final remarks Thursday.
   Yugo's acting chief executive, Marcel Kole, testified that
Norauto extended credit to Yugo with the cars as collateral and
granted Yugo a buyback option.
   Norauto attorney Roy E. Scheider argued the deal also was between
the liquidator and the car's manufacturer, Zavodi Crevna Zastava,
which was called the ``seller'' in the contract for the cars.
   The 4,700 autos in question are among 6,000 Yugos at American
ports. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. has a lien on the other cars.
Yugo's 260 dealers nationwide have about 9,500 cars.

   Lufthansa German Airlines has agreed to buy up
to 30 commerical aircraft from Airbus Industrie, a European
consortium, in an estimated $3 billion deal, Airbus officials said
Thursday.
   The order gives another boost to the commercial jet industry.
Earlier this month, American Airlines signed a 142-plane, estimated
$7 billion deal with McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   Lufthansa plans to use the new plans to replace uts fleet of
DC10-30 aircraft, enabling the airline to offer most nonstop routes
from West Germany to the United States, South America and the Far
East, Airbus said.
   The contract, signed Wednesday, calls for Lufthansa to buy 15
Airbus A340 aircraft for delivery between September 1992 and March
1994.
   Lufthansa will receive both A4340-200s, which seat 222
passengers, and A340-300s, which have 256-seat cabins. Both versions
are powered by CFM International CFM56-5C-2 engines.
   According to the contract, Lufthansa will decide later on whether
to purchase 15 more planes.
   With the Lufthansa order, Airbus now has firm orders, options and
commitments for 110 A340 aircraft, the consortium said.
   Last year, $48.5 billion in new planes were ordered, the highest
total ever. Industry officials estimate that the demand to replace
aging aircraft could push annual sales to $450 billion by the year
2005.

   The dollar dipped against several major
currencies but rose against the British pound and Canadian dollar on
Thursday in advance of Friday's release of U.S. trade figures.
   Most economists were expecting the merchandise trade deficit for
December to be slightly below the November figure of $12.5 billion.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar climbed to around 1.85
West German marks after the West German central bank announced it
would not be raising its key interest rates, following expectations
a rate hike would be announced. The rally failed to last.
   ``People have chased the dollar higher and lower a few times this
week and are obviously tired of it,'' one dealer in Europe said.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7712 from $1.7805 late
Wednesday. Later in New York, sterling fell to $1.7720 from $1.7743
late Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.43 yen to a closing 126.33 yen. Later in London,
the dollar was quoted at 126.33 yen. In New York, the dollar edged
down to 126.11 yen from 126.13 yen late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8388 West German marks, down from
1.8405; 1.5601 Swiss francs, down from 1.5623; 1.1867 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1796; 6.2600 French francs, down from 6.2658; and
1,344.3 Italian lire, down from 1,349.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.8425 West German marks, up from 1.8315; 1.5643 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5565; 6.2725 French francs, up from 6.2425; 2.0790
Dutch guilders, up from 2.0680; 1,348.50 Italian lire, up from
1,339.50; and 1.1859 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1800.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $382.25 a troy ounce,
compared with $382.00 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold closed at
$382.50 an ounce compared with $381.60 bid late Wednesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 54 cents to close at a bid of
$385.20 a troy ounce.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $383.60 a troy ounce from $384.60. Later, Republic
National Bank of New York quoted gold at $382.75 an ounce as of 4
p.m. EST compared with $383.60 late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market to a late bid of
$5.84 a troy ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $5.79. On New
York's Comex, silver for current delivery fell to $5.883 an ounce
from $5.890.

   Crude oil futures prices rose on Thursday, buoyed
by a combination of reports that included news of temporary
shutdowns of Norway's North Sea oil platforms.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 8 cents
to settle at $18.33 a barrel. The contract jumped 83 cents in the
previous session. Other contract months had slightly higher gains.
   Among refined oil products, the March contract for heating oil
rose 0.91 cent to 49.65 cents a gallon. The gains were triggered by
a report that Algeria's national oil company was experiencing cargo
loading problems, said Randall Rothenberg, an oil broker with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Unleaded gasoline for March delivery rose 0.28 cent to close at
49.05 cents a gallon.
   Crude oil prices had hovered in the $17 range for several weeks,
but surged Wednesday as investors anticipated a positive outcome
from next week's meeting of non-OPEC oil producers.
   Thursday's rally began after a report of a temporary production
disruption at two of Norway's North Sea Stratfjord oilfield
platforms. A report that Saudi Arabia had cut March contract volumes
to its Japan customers by 15 percent triggered more buying later in
the day, Rothenberg said.
   Nauman Barakat, an international energy analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said investors are remaining
optimistic ahead of next week's meeting of non-OPEC producers in
London.
   During a visit Thursday to Oklahoma City, Saudi oil minister
Hisham Nazer said he expects the meeting to produce an agreement
that could help to further stabilize oil prices.
   Nazer's remarks came after the close of trading but Barakat said
they could have a follow-through effect on Friday's market.

   The narrowest measure of the nation's money
supply, M1, rose $700 million in the week ended Feb. 6, the Federal
Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said M1 rose to a seasonally adjusted $787.4 billion from
a revised $786.7 billion the previous week.
   The broader money supply measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,068.9 billion from $3,071.3 billion.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,921.0 billion from $3,920.1 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed last year set a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent
to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in
M3. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is scheduled to announce new targets
in late February. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since
early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,068.7 billion, a 4.1
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,913.6 billion, up 5.1 percent, while M1 rose
2.0 percent to an average of $787.9 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $2.1 billion in
the latest week, compared with a decline of $247 million a week
earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $197 million, down
from $698 million.
   _Data on the monetary base provided by the Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis was unavailable Thursday.

   Seven new members were appointed Thursday to the
operating committee of RJR Nabisco Inc., which is continuing its
realignment after a record $25 billion takeover by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co.
   The seven executives, all of whom are corporate officers or top
managers from RJR subsidiaries, will join KKR founding partner Henry
Kravis, KKR partner Paul E. Raether and acting Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer J. Paul Sticht on the committee, which is charged
with overseeing all policy, strategic planning and administration of
the food and tobacco conglomerate.
   Also Thursday, a federal judge in New York refused to grant a
preliminary injunction that would have blocked Kohlberg Kravis'
takeover of RJR Nabisco, as requested by Metropolitan Life Insurance
Co. and Jefferson-Pilot Life Insurance Co.
   U.S. District Judge John Walker said the insurance companies,
which own RJR Nabisco bonds, had not proved they would be
irreparably harmed by the takeover. Irreparable harm must be proved
before a preliminary injunction can be handed down.
   Walker said he was allowing the case to proceed to trial. The
insurance companies have filed suit against the transaction on the
ground it has unfairly depressed the price of their RJR Nabisco
bonds.
   In announcing the appointments, Sticht said, ``We have brought
together the senior operating executives of the corporation with
senior corporate management to ensure our continued leadership in
the businesses we serve.''
   ``At the same time, we are aggressively seeking our new chief
executive officer, a process we hope to have completed within the
next several months,'' he said.
   Former Chairman F. Ross Johnson resigned from the Atlanta-based
company after his own takeover bid was rejected by RJR's board of
directors in favor of KKR's $109-a-share cash and securities offer.
   Earlier this week, Edward A. Horrigan Jr., who had joined with
Johnson in the attempted buyout, resigned as chairman and chief
executive officer of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., signaling his
failure to land the top job.
   Those named to the committee Thursday were:
   Harold L. Henderson, RJR Nabisco executive vice president and
general counsel; Edward J. Robinson, RJR Nabisco's executive vice
president, finance and chief financial officer; Ralph Angiuoli,
president and CEO of the company's domestic tobacco operations;
Robert J. Carbonell, chairman and CEO of Del Monte Foods; H. John
Greeniaus, president and CEO of Nabisco Brands Inc.; Lester W.
Pullen, chairman and CEO of the international tobacco subsidiary;
and Dolph W. von Arx, chairman, president and CEO of Planters
LifeSavers Co.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines' Machinists union has engaged in
``economic warfare'' by staging a two-day wildcat strike, illegal
slowdowns and sickouts since contract talks broke off early this
month, the carrier charged in federal court Thursday.
   Eastern claimed in response to union criticism that management
has acted solely within the legal bounds of a federally imposed,
30-day cooling-off period after the breakdown of 16 months of
contract talks.
   Eastern's allegations were contained in a five-page response _
plus 50 pages of related documents _ delivered to U.S. District
Judge C. Clyde Atkins.
   Atkins has ordered the airline to respond to the militant union's
motion for a temporary restraining order to block Eastern management
from hiring non-union workers to perform tasks traditionally handled
by organized labor.
   The Machinists union represents Eastern's 8,500 machinists,
baggage handlers and ground personnel who have been working without
a contract for the past 13 months.
   Atkins scheduled a hearing on the union request for late Friday
morning.
   The hearing will come at the end of a week that saw an
overwhelming 97.3 percent of Machinists members vote nationwide to
authorize a strike if no agreement is reached by midnight March 3 _
the end of the cooling-off period.
   The Miami-based airline will be free to impose its own work rules
and the union is free to strike legally at that time.
   ``Eastern's response to the wildcat strike and ongoing slowdown
has been measured and consistent with its Railway Labor Act
contractual obligations,'' the airline's court documents said.
   The wildcat walkouts ``were overt acts of economic warfare and
tended to further the bargaining goals'' of the union, they said.
   The airline charged that a work slowdown has grounded 17 of the
carrier's jetliners, which the document says amounts to ``almost 10
percent of Eastern's scheduled fleet.'' A company attorney said
Wednesday that 19 planes were grounded.
   The airline said the planes were awaiting scheduled checks that
could not be completed due to a work slowdown by Machinists.
   Union leader Charles Bryant dismissed management's slowdown
charges Wednesday, recalling Eastern's recent performance _
advertised as the No. 1 on-time operator in the industry.
   ``How could that possibly be going on if our people are slowing
down?'' he asked.
   Another passage in Eastern's response appeared likely to evoke
grim agreement from both sides in the dispute.
   Eastern stated that the situation at the financially strapped
airline ``promises to get much worse unless remedial action is taken
promptly.''
   The airline said ``even the present backlog of grounded aircraft
is totally unacceptable and poses a severe threat to a company in
Eastern's dire financial condition.''
   The airline is currently losing about $1 million a day and has
suffered losses estimated at $335.4 million for 1988.

   The government is scheduled to close the books
Friday on the first annual improvement in the trade deficit since
1980, but the deficit has leveled off in recent months and many
economists say it will get worse again.
   The financial markets' mild reaction to the recent trend could
reflect a view that with inflation the big concern, a widening
deficit is not of primary concern.
   American industry, already running near full tilt, may not be
able to produce a big increase in exports or substitute for imports
without overheating and leading to higher inflation, some economists
say.
   When the Commerce Department reported last month that the U.S.
trade deficit widened to $12.51 billion in November, a 22 percent
jump from October's $10.26 billion, the financial markets brushed it
off, surprising many analysts.
   Friday's report is expected to show the U.S. trade gap narrowed
to around $137 billion for 1988, a sharp improvement over the record
$170.3 billion in 1987.
   The last time the deficit narrowed was during President Carter's
last year in office. It widened during each year of President
Reagan's administration.
   Until recent months, poor trade reports induced currency dealers
to dump dollars out of fear that the dollar would need to decline to
make American-made goods competitive in world markets.
   But after the surprisingly bad November report heavy buying
pushed the dollar higher, spurring a rise in stocks and bonds.
Analysts, at a loss to explain the market reaction fully, attributed
it largely to technical factors.
   Reaction by the fickle financial markets to Friday's report is
unpredictable. Many economists believe December's deficit shrank
slightly from November.
   Some economists believe that the kind of strong growth in exports
that would be needed to shrink the deficit would be inflationary
because American industry is already running close to full capacity.
   Reduction in the budget deficit would give the economy some
slack, giving more room for the manufacturing sector to pick up
speed, some economists say.
   ``We should ask if we need an improvement in the trade balance
before we lower the budget deficit,'' said Robert Lawrence, senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
   ``In the context of the overall economy I guess you can say it's
not so bad that the trade deficit hasn't improved,'' he said.
   The dollar has been supported lately by high U.S. interest rates,
which make dollar-denominated securities attractive. At the same
time, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have stepped in to
prop the dollar up whenever it went into a steep slide.
   Both those factors have made the markets pay less attention to
unfavorable trade numbers.
   ``What (the markets) are saying is that if the trade numbers are
adverse they can count on the Fed to take remedial action. So it
makes them less uncomfortable,'' said Carol Stone, senior economist
with Nomura Securities International Inc.
   One economist who is concerned about the trade deficit, Robert
Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc., said the first
annual decline in the trade deficit in eight years obscures the
recent negative trend.
   ``If you look at the annual decline you get a picture of
progress, but that just reflects the first half. The second half
doesn't reflect progress,'' he said.
   More significant than the growth in imports, Brusca believes, is
the slowdown in the export growth rate, with no clear evidence that
is has bottomed out.
   The Brookings Institution's Lawrence said there are signs that
the inaugural euphoria is wearing off and that the financial markets
might be more inclined to take the trade numbers seriously this time
around.
   ``I see more of a chance that the dollar would take it if we see
a surprisingly large widening of the deficit,'' Lawrence said. ``But
if we see big trade numbers and nothing happens, I guess we can
expect that, too.''

<HEAD>State Bank Chief Says Norway's Oil Binge Is Over</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spending is down, unemployment and
bankruptcies are up, and Norway's oil-based economy is still
recovering from the morning-after effects of a 15-year binge, the
head of the central bank said Thursday.
   Tough government measures last year made headway in limiting
wages, trimming inflation and swinging foreign trade into the black,
said Bank of Norway Director Hermod Skaanland.
   ``There are no easy solutions to the problems we are facing.
Fifteen years of speculation, oil boom and an ever-increasing
standard of living have put us where we are today,'' said Skaanland.
   Skaanland's address to the bank's steering committee coincided
with the publication of the 1988 balance sheet, which showed an
increase of 27.4 percent to 7.9 billion kronor, or about $1.18
billion. The bank transferred $1.12 billion to the state treasury.
   Skaanland said the end was near for Norway's era of petroleum
wealth, which began with the 1969 discovery of oil off its North Sea
coast. Production in 1989 is expected to average 1.44 million
barrels per day.
   ``We are already approaching the peak in our oil production,'' he
said. ``It will continue to increase for a few more years and then
begin to taper off in the late 1990s.''
   Skaanland urged the Labor government of Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland to continue the belt-tightening measures started after
oil prices collapsed in 1986.
   ``Last year, most of us began to feel the direct effect of
(Norway's) new economic reality. The feeling of job security is
lower than at any time since World War II,'' he said.
   Unemployment doubled last year to 4 percent of the work force,
the highest rate since the 1930s. During 1988, 3,494 companies filed
bankruptcy petitions, up 81 percent over 1987. Many of them were
forced out of business by high interest rates and a drop in private
consumption by 1.6 percent.
   He urged the government to continue keeping the lid on wages to
help Norway regain its international competitiveness. A wage limit
last year helped bring inflation down to 5.6 percent from 7 percent
in 1987. Foreign trade scored a 1988 surplus of $618 million.
   Norway's 1988 banking crisis cost banks more than $1.04 billion
in losses on loans, according to official estimates. Skaanland said
these losses were due to ``bad banking, bad policies and bad luck.''
   ``Even if banks show significant losses in 1989 as well, we
expect net results to show an improvement,'' he said.

<HEAD>Valley Lemons Hurt Worst, Scattered Orange Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROB WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last week's deep freeze could have walloped
California's citrus groves, but officials said Thursday a blend of
hard work, timing and good luck spared the crop from a devastating
loss.
   ``It would have been a disaster and it just didn't develop,''
said Denny Myers, vice president of agricultural affairs for Dole
Citrus. ``Overall, we're just not seeing it.''
   Growers said it was still too early to provide a full damage
report from the record-breaking cold weather which brought snow to
Malibu and left icicles clinging to California oranges.
   The San Joaquin Valley navel orange crop was damaged but did not
suffer a major internal freeze as some growers had feared. Orange
rinds were scarred by ice, which means fruit will be downgraded in
packing sheds and command a lower price, those interviewed said.
   Valley lemons were hurt the worst, with estimates ranging from 20
to 50 percent of the existing crop lost to the freeze, officials
said. But San Joaquin Valley lemons total only 10 percent of the
California-Arizona crop, and about half the valley lemons had been
picked and stored before the freeze, said Curt Anderson, spokesman
for Sunkist in Van Nuys.
   ``We don't see it as enough to be that concerned,'' Anderson said.
   Southern California's citrus groves largely escaped freeze damage
because Santa Ana winds kept the cold temperatures from damaging the
crop, Anderson said. But those winds scarred fruit and knocked some
of it to the ground.
   Citrus is damaged when the mercury remains at 26 degrees or lower
for four hours or more. In one part of Tulare County, which boasts a
$357 million citrus crop, temperatures last week stayed at 23
degrees for 8{ hours.
   A sudden burst of warm weather still could harm the oranges by
frost causing frost-tinged fruit to swell with liquid and drop from
the frozen stems, officials warned.
   ``Growers throughout the valley got hit. It was a democratic
freeze,'' said Joel Nelson, president of Visalia-based California
Citrus Mutual, which represents 800 growers who raise 50,000 acres
of citrus trees.
   But there was room for optimism regarding the Valencia orange
crop which has three months to recover from the frost's bite before
harvest.
   ``I don't think consumers will see a large cost increase,'' said
Nelson, reflecting the view of several industry officials. ``I'd be
very surprised if they see a major increase at the retail level.''
   Wholesale orange prices generally have increased $1.50 to $2 a
box in the last week due to the freeze, and retail prices have gone
up 20 cents a pound in some outlets, said Rod Rosales, a buyer for
OK Produce in Fresno. Before the freeze, a 40-pound box of
medium-sized oranges cost $6.50.
   Mike Burchett, general manager of Central Valley Citrus
Association in Tulare County, predicted frost damaged 10 percent to
15 percent of the navel crop, which is in harvest now.
   Growers credit the crop's apparent survival to a number of
factors, said Myers of Dole.
   Farmers ran warm water in groves, burned fuel oil and cranked up
giant fans to raise the temperature around the trees. The cold
weather came later than usual, which is good news since the crop
contained a higher sugar content and that acted much like
anti-freeze, Myers said.

   West Point-Pepperell Inc. said Thursday it
had extended its deadline for buyout proposals until next Tuesday.
   Pepperell's announcement came a day after Farley Inc. of Chicago
extended its $1.53 billion offer for the Georgia-based textile
company until midnight Friday.
   Pepperell said it would not reveal the identity of any bidders or
the nature of any bids received so far.
   The company's directors had declared a noon Wednesday deadline
when they put Pepperell up for sale Feb. 3, saying they believed
Farley's $52-per-share cash offer was too low.
   The latest deadline for bids is noon EST on Tuesday.
   In a letter to shareholders filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Pepperell said it would withhold any comment on
the bidding process _ which it said includes several interested
parties _ until ``after an agreement in principle or definitive
agreement is entered into between the company and a prospective
purchaser.
   ``Until then, the process will be deemed to be continuing,'' the
letter said.

<HEAD>United Telecom, Major Owner Of US Sprint, Reports Earnings Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Telecommunications Inc., the
majority owner of US Sprint Communications Co., said Thursday its
earnings shot up in the fourth quarter because of a one-time gain
from operations it sold.
   United Telecom also said US Sprint's results improved sharply in
the quarter. The nation's third-biggest long-distance company had
its first positive operating income except for a one-time charge for
restructuring, United Telecom said.
   United Telecom assumed management control of US Sprint in July
1988 and purchased controlling interest from its former 50-50
partner, GTE Corp., on Jan. 3 of this year.
   ``This has been a year of extaordinary change and outstanding
progress for United Telecom, a year in which we started to realized
the positive results of our long-term strategy,'' William T. Esrey,
the president, said in a statement.
   The company said it earned $379.5 million, or $3.70 a share, in
the quarter, up from $29.1 million, or 29 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue jumped to $1.73 billion from $780 million. US
Sprint's revenue was not included in the year-earlier period.
   The bulk of the quarterly profit came from an after-tax gain of
$369 million, which was mainly from the sale of the company's
cellular and paging operations. That gain wsa partially offset by an
after-tax loss of $64 million charge consisting of United Telecom's
share of a restructuring charge at US Sprint.
   For all of 1988, United Telecom said net income improved to a
record $508.9 million, or $4.95 a share, from a loss of $51.5
million the previous year.
   In 1988, United Telecom had consolidated net revenues of $6.5
billion, compared with $2.9 billion in 1987 when Sprint's revenues
of $2.7 billion were not included.
   Esrey said US Sprint had long-distance revenue of $3.4 billion in
1988, up 27 percent from $2.67 billion the year before. Including
the $195 million business restructuring charge, US Sprint had an
operating loss of $181 million for the fourth quarter and $409
million for the year in 1988.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nynex Corp. said Thursday William C. Ferguson
will succeed Delbert C. Staley as its chairman and chief executive
after Staley retires on Sept. 30.
   Nynex is the regional Bell holding company for New York and New
England, and Staley had served as its chief since its creation in
the breakup of the Bell System in 1984.
   Ferguson, 58, has been a vice chairman of Nynex since 1987. He
was president and chief executive of New York Telephone Co. from
1983 to 1986.
   Staley will turn 65, the company's mandatory retirement age, in
September.
   In an interview, Staley said he felt he was leaving the company
in good shape but said Nynex continues to go through the transition
that began with the Bell System breakup.
   Ferguson said regulation is inhibiting Nynex's ability to respond
to customers' needs. He said the company was let down by a ruling by
U.S. District Judge Harold Greene this week that barred the company
from entering the overseas long-distance business through a
trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cable venture.
   ``We're still assessing our options on (how to respond to
Greene's decision),'' Ferguson said. ``We're very disappointed.
Everyone seems to agree we have a global economy. Therefore to
restrict and inhibit the major players doesn't make sense.''
   Ferguson will become chief executive and president on June 1,
then drop the newly created title of president when he becomes
chairman on Oct. 1, Nynex said.

<HEAD>Coca-Cola Agrees to Make Changes in Diet Coke Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soft drink giants Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsi-Cola
Co. each claimed Thursday they had been vindicated by the television
networks in their latest advertising spat.
   Coca-Cola said it agreed to make what it called ``two minor
alterations'' in its new ads that claim a ``move is on'' from
regular Pepsi to Diet Coke.
   The Atlanta-based company said the revised campaign would
continue to air on network television.
   ``Diet Coke wins again,'' the company said.
   But Pepsi-Cola, which had complained to the networks that the
Diet Coke spot was false and misleading, said the requested
alterations represented ``fundamental changes.''
   ``They called a foul against Coke ... We are overjoyed,'' said
Tod MacKenzie, a spokesman for Pepsi in Somers, N.Y.
   At the same time, Pepsi said it had voluntarily withdrawn its ad
that poked fun at how Coca-Cola came up with its claims, showing
executives poring over soft drink statistics while wearing
distorting 3D glasses.
   MacKenzie said its ad was aired only as an interim measure while
the networks reviewed its complaint abot the Diet Coke ads.
   In the original series of ads launched in late January, Coca-Cola
took the unusual step of positioning Diet Coke against the sugared
version of Pepsi.
   ``Last year, nearly two million families stopped buying Pepsi and
more of them moved to Diet Coke than any other major soft drink,''
the Diet Coke ads said.
   After a review by the networks, Coca-Cola said it agreed to
change the second part of its claim to say, ``... and about a half
million of them moved to Diet Coke.''
   Coca-Cola also agreed to indicate on the screen the name of the
research company that came up with the data supporting its claim and
note that it includes both Diet Coke and caffeine-free Diet Coke.

<HEAD>Kelly, Back In Takeover Game, Bids For Envirodyne</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald P. Kelly has returned to the takeover game
with a $690 million offer for Envirodyne Industries Inc., the
manufacturer said Thursday.
   Envirodyne of Chicago said it had discussions with Kelly and
investment banker Salomon Brothers Inc. on their proposal to acquire
all of the company's outstanding stock for $38 a share.
   With 18.2 million shares outstanding, the offer values Envirodyne
at $690 million.
   Envirodyne's stock rose $4.50 to $37.25 Thursday in
over-the-counter trading.
   Envirodyne spokeswoman Helen Gallagher said company executives
had not decided whether a sale would be in the best interests of
shareholders.
   Kelly, the former chairman of Beatrice Co., declined to comment
on the offer.
   He heads D.P. Kelly &amp; Associates, a Chicago firm he formed after
resigning from Beatrice last year to seek, in partnership with
Salomon, acquisitions of ``undervalued companies.''
   Envirodyne also said it had been asked by Artra Group Inc., which
owns 26.3 percent of Envirodyne, to consider Artra's participation
with Kelly and Salomon.
   Last August, Artra tried and failed to put together a cash offer
for Envirodyne that would have been worth about $36 per share.
   Artra officials declined to comment. The company, based in
Northfield, owns Sargent-Welch Scientific Co. and 70 percent of Lori
Corp., a jewelry and accessories business.
   Envirodyne makes sausage casing and plastics.
   Kelly, 66, rose to prominence in the 1970s by transforming
meatpacker Swift &amp; Co. into Esmark Inc, a conglomerate of food and
consumer products. He sold Esmark to Beatrice in 1984, then teamed
up two years later with leveraged buyout specialist Kohlberg, Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. to purchase Beatrice for $6.2 billion.
   Kelly announced his resignation from Beatrice in August after
selling off large chunks of the company.

<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. reported Thursday its
second-quarter earnings rose 12 percent on sales gains in all of its
divisions.
   Campbell said it earned $94.9 million, or 73 cents a share,
compared to $84.6 million, or 65 cents per share, during the same
period last year.
   The Camden-based company said its sales rose to $1.58 billion in
the quarter ended Jan. 29 from $1.34 billion a year earlier.
   ``All of Campbell's operating divisions _ Campbell U.S.A.,
Campbell International, Pepperidge Farm and Campbell Enterprise _
scored impressive sales and operating earning gains despite
increased cost pressures affecting the ingredients and packaging,''
Campbell President R. Gordon McGovern said in a news release.
   Earnings for the first half of Campbell's fiscal year totaled
$164.2 million or $1.27 per share, compared to $179.5 million, or
$1.38 a share, in the first six months of last year.
   The year-earlier results included a $32.5 million after-tax gain
for a change in the company's accounting for income taxes.
   Sales for the first six months increased to $2.92 billion from
$2.52 billion last year.
