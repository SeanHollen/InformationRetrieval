<HEAD>Soviet Freighter Dumps Waste at Quebec Port</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   BAIE-COMEAU, Canada (AP) _ A Soviet freighter whose cargo of
toxic waste was turned away from Britain dumped the load on this
Lawrence River seaport before dawn Thursday and returned to sea.
   The freighter Nadezhda Obukhova had returned the 15 steel
containers of waste to Canada. But environmentalists in Baie-Comeau
had won a court order early Thursday banning the unloading of the
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. It was not clear whether the
freighter's captain was aware of the court order.
   Lawyer Shirley Kennedy said several community groups she
represents are seeking contempt charges against the captain, the
general manager of Dynamis Envirotech, the Montreal company hired to
dispose of the cargo, and a half dozen dockworkers who unloaded the
waste.
   ``We don't plan any action to get the ship to return to take it
away. It's up to the government to get them out of here,'' said Ms.
Kennedy.
   Joseph Storozuk, vice president of the ship's Canadian agent,
Morlines, said only the public utility Hydro-Quebec and Dynamis
Envirotech are named in Corriveau's order.
   Judge Paul Corriveau, who issued the 10-day injunction against
unloading, now will consider whether to file contempt charges.
   The cargo was guarded by police, deployed after some residents
rallied Wednesday to protest the waste disposal plans.
   Dynamis Envirotch lawyer Laurent Trudeau suggested at a court
hearing that Corriveau order the waste be stored at its intended
destination, a Hydro-Quebec site.
   Polychlorinated biphenyls were used primarily as a coolant in
electrical transformers but have been banned in North America
because of links to cancer.
   British officials say they can be safely disposed of at very high
temperatures. Canada has only one such incinerator, at Alberta, and
it does not handle waste from other states.
   When Liverpool dock owners and workers refused to unload the
cargo, Quebec Environment Minister Lise Bacon announced they would
be stored at a site 20 miles from this port.
   The freighter picked up the toxic waste in Montreal last month.
It had been sent by truck from nearby St-Basile-le-Grand, where it
was left over from a warehouse fire.

   Two Ohio teen-agers left a suicide
note in their hotel room, then leaped 12 stories to their deaths
from their balcony at Walt Disney World, authorities said Wednesday.
   Jerry Heitzman, 17, of Tipp City, and Christine Ruetter, 18, of
Kettering, were killed Tuesday when they landed on the roof of the
first-floor restaurant at a Howard Johnson, said Orange County
sheriff's spokeswoman Denise Gainer.
   ``They wrote a note expressing their intention to commit suicide
and jumped together from their 14th-story balcony,'' she said. The
hotel has no 13th floor.
   The contents of the note were not released.
   The teen-agers' parents were unaware they had traveled to
Florida, investigators said. Heitzman's parents were in the Orlando
area late Wednesday, and the woman's parents were expected by
Thursday afternoon, Ms. Gainer said.
   ``The father had reported his son missing. The mother of the
daughter was vacationing when the daughter left, so she was unaware
when the daughter left with Heitzman,'' Ms. Gainer said.
``Apparently they used the daughter's mom's credit card for the
room.''
   The teen-agers, who had known each other for about two months,
drove to Florida in the boy's pickup truck, checked into the hotel
Saturday and were scheduled to check out Wednesday, she said. They
visited both Disney World and the Disney-MGM Studios.

   Today is Thursday, Aug. 24, the 236th day of 1989. There are 129
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Fifty years ago, on Aug. 24, 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union
announced they had, during the night, signed a 10-year
non-aggression pact, each country pledging not to ``associate itself
with any other grouping of powers which directly or indirectly is
aimed at the other party.''
   On this date:
   In A.D. 79, long-dormant Mount Vesuvius erupted, burying the
Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in volcanic ash. An
estimated 20,000 people died.
   In A.D. 410, Rome was overrun by the Visigoths, an event that
symbolized the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
   In 1572, the slaughter of French Protestants at the hands of
Catholics began in Paris on St. Bartholomew's Day. The killings
lasted until October, and claimed some 13,000 victims.
   In 1814, British forces invaded Washington, D.C., and proceeded
to set fire to the Capitol and the White House.
   In 1932, Amelia Earhart became the first woman to make a non-stop
flight across the United States, traveling from Los Angeles to
Newark, N.J., in just over 19 hours.
   In 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty went into effect, with the
parties agreeing that an armed attack against one would be
considered ``an attack against them all.''
   In 1954, the Communist Control Act went into effect, virtually
outlawing the Communist Party in the United States.
   In 1959, three days after Hawaiian statehood, Hiram L. Fong was
sworn in as the first Chinese-American U.S. senator while Daniel K.
Inouye was sworn in as the first Japanese-American in the U.S. House
of Representatives.
   In 1968, France became the world's fifth thermonuclear power as
it exploded a hydrogen bomb in the South Pacific.
   In 1970, a bomb planted by anti-war extremists exploded at the
University of Wisconsin's Army Math Research Center in Madison,
killing 33-year-old researcher Robert Fassnacht.
   In 1981, Mark David Chapman was sentenced in New York to 20 years
to life in prison for the shooting death of rock star John Lennon.
   In 1982, Archbishop Joseph L. Bernardin was installed as head of
Chicago's Roman Catholic archdiocese.
   Ten years ago: A 73-hour stand-off began at New York's Kennedy
International Airport as U.S. officials prevented the takeoff of an
Aeroflot jetliner until they could determine whether Soviet
ballerina Lyudmila Vlasova was returning home voluntarily after the
defection to the United States of her husband, dancer Alexander
Godunov. (Vlasova was ultimately allowed to leave.)
   Five years ago: On the heels of the Republican convention,
Democrat Walter F. Mondale said the proceedings had demonstrated
that President Ronald Reagan represented the party of the rich,
while Reagan questioned Mondale's commitment to a strong defense.
   One year ago: Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
picked up the endorsement of the AFL-CIO while Republican nominee
George Bush campaigned in California with President Reagan.
   Today's birthdays: TV personality Durward Kirby is 77. TV host
Dennis James is 72. Former secretary of education Shirley Hufstedler
is 64. Boxer Gerry Cooney is 33. Actor Steve Guttenberg is 31.
All-star shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. is 29.
   Thought for today: ``Posterity is as likely to be wrong as
anybody else.'' _ Heywood Broun, American journalist and author
(1888-1939).

   A family of four drowned in Lake Tahoe
after their 12-foot sailboat capsized Wednesday in high winds and
rough water, authorities said.
   The dead were identified as Robert Calder, 39; his 30-year-old
wife, Pamela; and the couple's 8-year-old daughter, Jasmine, and
6-year-old son, Catlin, all of Sacramento, Calif., said Douglas
County sheriff's deputies.
   The bodies were found floating nearly in the center of the lake
which turned choppy after a fast-moving cold front pushed winds to
more than 35 mph and temperatures dropped to about 60 degrees.
   Sheriff's Sgt. Larry Coy said the victims wore life belts, but
not the type that will keep a person's head above water. He also
theorized the victims suffered hypothermia due to the high winds and
chilly water.
   Coy said the family had been camping with friends at Bliss State
Park on the California shore and had gone sailing early in the day
before winds picked up and temperatures dropped.

<HEAD>`Squeaky' Fromme's Guns Donated to Ford Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Gerald Ford Museum has a new piece
of memorabilia _ the gun that Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme pointed at
the president 14 years ago.
   ``We want all the possible documentation of President Ford's
administration, the good and the bad,'' curator James Kratsas said.
``Certainly this is a part of the bad aspect of it.''
   Kratsas requested the gun after finding out that the U.S.
Marshal's office in Sacramento, Calif., was about to destroy it, as
is customary with most seized firearms, said U.S. Marshal John R.
Kendall of Grand Rapids.
   On Wednesday, Kendall and Tim Trombley, head of the local Secret
Service office, donated to the museum the .45-caliber Colt
semiautomatic pistol as well as two .38-caliber revolvers that had
belonged to Fromme.
   Ford was walking to the California State Capital Building from
his hotel on Sept. 5, 1975, when Fromme pushed through the crowd,
drew the pistol from a holster on her thigh and pointed it at the
president as he stood nearby shaking hands with well-wishers.
   Fromme, then 26 and a long-time follower of convicted mass
murderer Charles Manson, was restrained by Secret Service agents who
wrestled the gun away from her and led the president to safety.
   Convicted of attempted murder, she was sentenced to life in
prison.
   Kratsas said Fromme's pistol, a U.S. Army issue handgun that
never was listed as stolen, won't be displayed at the museum
immediately, but may be in the future.

<TEXT>
   About 200 fans and celebrities paid tribute to
actor Rudolph Valentino on the 63rd anniversary of the romantic
idol's death.
   ``Mr. Valentino looked to motion pictures as an art,'' 1985 Emmy
winner Dennis Williams said during a memorial service Wednesday at
the Old Hollywood Cemetery, where Valentino's remains are kept in a
modest crypt.
   In keeping with tradition, the Lady in Black _ her identity
unknown to other mourners _ placed roses, gladiolas and carnations
and a picture of the star next to the crypt.
   Actress Mady Maguire, a prominent film star of the 1920s and
1930s, remembered Valentino as an actor ``with style and
individualism'' whose success, she said, stemmed from his love and
respect for women.
   Born in 1895, the Italian-American leading man achieved fame in
such films as ``The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,'' ``The Sheik''
and ``Blood nd Sand.'' He appeared in 33 films.
   Valentino's sudden death on Aug. 23, 1926, of peritonitus
prompted several suicides. His funeral was a national event.

   Some statistics known about Neptune as
Voyager 2 nears the planet for its close examination tonight:
   DIAMETER: About 30,700 miles, nearly four time's Earth's diameter
and the fourth largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus,
which is only a bit larger with a diameter of 31,760 miles.
   MOONS: Two majorones, Triton and Nereid, plus at least four
others discovered so far by Voyager 2. Triton, four-fifths the size
of Earth's moon, is the only large moon in the solar system to orbit
a planet backwards. That suggests it once was a sun-orbiting comet
that hit a Neptunian moon and was ``captured'' into orbit around
Neptune.
   RINGS: So far Voyager has found Neptune is orbited by one
complete ring of debris, and one ring arc, or partial ring, which
scientists believe also may prove to be a complete ring upon closer
inspection.
   DAY LENGTH: Surface wind suggests Neptune takes nearly 18 hours
to spin on its axis, but Voyager's measurements indicate a day on
Neptune is closer to 16 hours, the time it takes for the bulk of the
planet's interior to rotate.
   YEAR LENGTH: Neptune takes 165 Earth years to make a single orbit
around the sun. That means a winter on Neptune lasts more than 40
Earth years.
   DISTANCE FROM SUN: Orbits the sun at an average distance of 2.793
billion miles, 30 times as far as Earth and invisible to the naked
eye from Earth. Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun,
but because of Pluto's elongated orbit it is now the ninth and
outermost.
   WEATHER: A chilly 307 degrees below zero Fahrenheit at an
altitude where the atmospheric pressure is twice that at sea level
on Earth. Voyager has revealed cirrus-like clouds, 400-mph wind and
an Earth-sized cyclone and other storms in Neptune's atmosphere. The
source of the internal heat creating Neptune's weather is a mystery;
Earth's comes from decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   ATMOSPHERE: Primarily hydrogen and helium, but Neptune appears
pale blue-green because enough methane, the major component of
natural gas, is present to absorb red light.
   STRUCTURE: Scientists suspect that a third of the way toward
Neptune's center the atmosphere gives way to a slurry of water and
rock, with no distinct sky-sea boundary.
   DISCOVERY: In 1846, by Johann Gottfried Galle and Heinrich Louis
d'Arrest at the Berlin Observatory. Neptune was discovered because
its presence was predicted based on disturbances in Uranus' orbit.

   Five homicides per day is the norm in the Big
Apple, but it doesn't take a crack-crazed gunman to kill you here _
death can be as close as the nearest street corner.
   Ellen Sauer had just decided to take a nap Saturday evening when
a steam pipe exploded beneath the street outside her Manhattan
apartment building, killing her and two Consolidated Edison workers
who had responded to what had been a routine call.
   ``By chance that woman had been in the front of her apartment,''
The New York Times editorialized Tuesday about Mrs. Sauer's death.
``And it was chance that put those particular workmen at that
particular site.''
   Random death is a reality from Podunk to Peoria, but in New York
City _ where murders hit an all-time high last year, where the
infrastructure is deteriorating, where high-rise construction can be
fatal _ the odds are a little higher.
   In the past two months, numerous other New Yorkers found
themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time:
   _ An apparent leak of natural gas set off an explosion, burying
Reginald Boynes beneath a ton of brick in his Washington Heights
home on July 15.
   _ A stoop on a Lower East Side building collapsed, crushing a
10-year-old girl and her 11-year-old friend while they were playing
a week earlier.
   _ A beer bottle thrown from a 15-story building struck a passing
4-year-old girl on the head on June 17. Sheena Fuller died five days
later.
   _ A 500-pound concrete slab fell from the FDR Drive onto a car
driven by Benjamin Bernstein, 49, who was going to pick up his wife
in Manhattan on June 1. He was killed instantly. Investigators found
40 more flawed sections of the highway after his death.
   It's not limited to natives. In June 1988, a North Carolina man
was killed when a ceiling at the Helmsley Windsor Hotel caved in
while he was lying in bed. A summons was issued to owners Harry and
Leona Helmsley.
   To this, you can add the gunfire which has become one of the
sounds of New York City. Last year, more than 1,800 people were
killed.
   According to a study by Lawrence W. Sherman, University of
Maryland professor of criminology, the number of innocent bystanders
gunned down in New York has increased each year since 1985 _ when
the number was four _ to last year's dozen.
   ``It is very frightening, and I don't see any indication that
it's turning around,'' said Thomas Reppetto, head of the New
York-based Citizens Crime Commission.
   This year, it took just three days for a bystander to get killed
_ 14-year-old Jeffrey Vilain of Brooklyn was returning home from a
prayer meeting when he was killed by a 9mm slug.
   Last month, 17-year-old Sean Singh was enjoying a late-night
snack at a Brooklyn fast-food restaurant when he was fatally shot in
the chest by a gunman robbing a woman outside. For Singh's family,
it ended a dream which began eight years ago when they arrived here
from Guyana.
   ``We wanted to give him a better life ... If we had stayed at
home, even if we were eating rice and peas, it would still be
peaceful,'' said his grandmother, Stella Singh. ``We would not have
lost our child like this.''
   Construction accidents also claim an unknown number of lives each
year. Some _ such as an aspiring actor killed in 1987 when a beam
fell on him while he walked down a mid-Manhattan street _ attract
attention, while others pass unnoticed among the constant
restructuring of the city skyline.
   The most famous victim of a construction accident survived _
Brigitte Gerney, whose legs were crushed by a 35-ton crane that
tipped over on her while she walked past a mid-Manhattan
construction site on May 30, 1985.
   Her recovery, during which she received a call from President
Reagan, gained front-page headlines. Mrs. Gerney, 53, received a $10
million settlement last year and has since shunned the spotlight she
never sought.
   ``She's relieved it's over and wishes it never happened,'' her
attorney, Robert Conanson, said after the July 1988 agreement. ``She
wants to be a private, productive person.''

   The independence that many in the Baltic republics
are striving for is a rarity in their long history at the crossroads
of some of Europe's mightiest armies.
   Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin, Russian czars and Swedish kings have
marched their forces across the flat land at the eastern end of the
Baltic Sea.
   Although Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians are among the oldest
peoples of Europe, they have enjoyed relatively rare moments of
independence, and more often have been fought over by their larger
and more powerful neighbors.
   ``We are slaves,'' Lithuanian philosopher Vitautus Kazlauskas
told an independence rally in the republic's capital of Vilnius on
Wednesday. ``We have been sold so many times.''
   At the beginning of the century the Baltic republics formed part
of the Russian Empire's window on the West, a rich ethnic melting
pot that included Germans, Poles, Jews, Russians and Ukrainians.
   In contrast to the Slavs who dominated the empire, they used the
Latin alphabet and were primarily Roman Catholics and Lutherans
instead of Orthodox Christians.
   Their land guarded the southern approach to the czar's capital of
St. Petersburg at the end of the Gulf of Finland. Finland, across a
narrow gulf, guarded the northern approach.
   But capping a rising tide of nationalism at the end of the 19th
century, the Baltics in 1918 declared their independence after the
czar's empire crumbled under the weight of war and revolution.
   Much of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania watched Lenin's Bolsheviks
seize power in St. Petersburg from behind German lines. As a bloody
civil war and famine enveloped revolutionary Russia, the Baltics
became a vital listening post for foreign diplomats and journalists
to whom the Russian borders were closed.
   While some were eager to join the ranks of the Red Army's
``internationalist brigades'' and fight for the Bolsheviks in the
bloody civil war that followed the revolution, other Lithuanians,
Latvians and Estonians started building independent countries that
Lenin recognized in a treaty signed in 1920.
   Those small independent lands set up parliamentary governments
and took their place in international affairs, establishing
embassies in the United States as well as many other countries.
   Bu as World War II approached, they found themselves caught
between two of the main adversaries _ Germany and Russia _ just as
they had during World War I.
   And Josef Stalin, eager to regain the territories lost during the
revolution, brought Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia into the Soviet
sphere of influence in a secret agreement with Hitler signed Aug.
23, 1939, eight days before Germany attacked Poland.
   Less than a year later, Soviet tanks and soldiers entered the
region, which was forcibly annexed to the Soviet Union. Stalin had
thousands of opponents shot or exiled to Siberia, and carried out a
second wave of repression after the Soviet Union reclaimed the
Baltics from Germany at the end of the war.
   For decades the Soviet Union insisted that the republics joined
voluntarily and denied that there had been any secret deal with
Hitler. The United States and other Western countries never
recognized the absorption of the Baltic republics, and almost 50
years later the embassies of the once-independent countries still
function in Washington.
   ``The Soviet Union has done everything to remove the republics of
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania from the memory and the map of
Europe, from your libraries and textbooks, your sense of justice,
your grief and your minds,'' Baltic activists said in a declaration
Tuesday on the eve of the Hitler-Stalin agreement.

   Don't birds know they shouldn't smoke in
nests?
   Authorities are blaming a bird with a cigarette for starting a
fire that caused $2,500 damage to a home in western Pennsylvania on
Wednesday.
   The bird carried a lighted cigarette butt into its nest on the
house, starting a fire that damaged the porch and some siding,
firefighters said.
   No injuries were reported.
   ``The bird definitely started the fire. That's the only thing it
could be,'' firefighter Robert Carter said.
   Parts of the cigarette were found next to the nest, and the porch
had no electrical fixtures, Carter said.

   Robert Duck, a seven-time winner, said he's afraid his
participation again this year could cause competitors to quack in
their boots. Instead he plans to rent 60 of his waddlers to others
this weekend for $5 apiece, with proceeds going to charity.
   ``We've won seven of the last nine years, and last year we made a
clean sweep of all three places,'' Duck said. ``People get reluctant
to participate if they don't think they have a chance to win.''
   Duck, an Albuquerque businessman, puts his charges through six
weeks of intensive training before each race and pays close heed to
bloodlines.
   ``I stick to registered ducks,'' Duck said. ``Mine are all in the
American Quarter-Duck Association.''
   Race officials expect 400 ducks to join in two days of racing.
   ``Everyone who's been trying to beat Duck all these years has
added to their flocks and seems determined to win,'' said George
Hoskins of the Deming Chamber of Commerce.
   The world's richest duck race began in 1980 and has grown into a
three-day festival, including a beauty contest for people dressed as
ducks, an outhouse race and a tortilla toss for which the record is
322 feet.
   The ducks race on the lawn of the Luna County Courthouse, along
16-foot, straight-line tracks.
   The fastest fowl wins $2,000. In all, $7,500 in prize money will
be distributed.

   If any of the contestants who have been
smooching for 12 days in pursuit of a $10,000 prize plan to give up
anytime soon, they aren't saying. Their lips are sealed.
   Of 15 couples who entered The Great American Kiss-Off Aug. 12
under a tent in the parking lot of a furniture store, six continued
kissing Wednesday.
   Bob Cross, general manager of KWNZ, the radio station
co-sponsoring the contest with the store, said the competitors are
making themselves comfortable by watching television and reading
books while lips remain engaged.
   ``We thought it would go a maximum of two weeks, but it doesn't
look like that now,'' he said.
   ``Once you start and go on this long, you don't want to quit,''
contestant Karen Gonzales explained. ``If it lasts longer, we'll
just do it until we win.''
   Cross said the radio station plans to keep the contest going
until there's a winner. Couples must kiss from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
with five minutes of break time for every hour.

   A woman who attempted to dramatize the plight
of the homeless by walking 790 miles to Washington, D.C., has given
up her trek after raising only $1.12 in 130 miles, saying she is
disillusioned with humanity.
   Maria Rogers Johnson, 31, said donations were poor because
publicity about her hike also revealed her criminal convictions on
charges of felony arson, retail theft, and fleeing and eluding
police.
   Ms. Johnson, who attributed her record to a drug and alcohol
abuse problem, said the news in turn prompted her employer to fire
her from her job as house-mother at a home for unwed pregnant women.
   ``I came back a changed person,'' she said. ``I always believed
in the goodness of people. I really don't believe that anymore.''
   Ms. Johnson said her attitude was reinforced by people she met
who refused to donate to her cause, display her brochure or even
give her a place to stay overnight or feed her.
   ``There were a lot of good people out there but, at the same
time, there was a lot of meanness. The bad outnumbered the good,''
she said.
   She said her impressions changed only slightly Wednesday when she
received a letter from an aide to President Bush commending her
``heroism in wanting to spotlight the plight of the homeless through
your own sacrifice.''

<HEAD>Schools To Guarantee Skills of Graduates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Graduates of high schools in the the area where the
Pilgrims landed will approach prospective employers with a diploma
and a guarantee that they know basic skills.
   ``We will warrantee for three years after graduation the skills
of our graduates,'' Superintendent Bernard Sidman said Wednesday.
``If any time during that three-year period, an employer reports to
us that, for example, a graduate cannot make change at a cash
register, we will, with no charge to anybody, allow the student to
enroll in one of our evening classes for retooling.''
   Sidman said the guarantee, effective with the 1990 high school
graduating class, was approved unanimously Tuesday night by the
Plymouth-Carver Regional School Committee.
   ``It is the school committee's response to the cry for
accountability and also to complaints we hear all the time around
the country about student skills in reading and arithmetic,'' he
said.
   Sidman said the school district will take an employer's word
there is an educational deficiency and offer retraining. He said the
district has a strong adult education program, so it can keep its
promise.
   The two-municipality district, he said, has about 2,500 students
in three high schools about 30 miles south of Boston.
   Sidman said the area, which has a heavy concentration of
tourist-related businesses, offers many year-round jobs to high
school graduates.
   ``The school board has been very concerned with the performance
of their students,'' he said. ``They want to let the community know
they are responsive.''
   The idea was based on a guarantee program offered by the Wayzata,
Minn., school district, Sidman said.
   David Landswerk, superintendent of the Minnesota district, said
in a telephone interview the program has succeeded in the two years
it has been offered, and that not a single graduate has been
referred back to the school by an employer.
   Lucille Balombiny, Landswerk's executive assistant, said the
Wayzata program was approved by the school board in February 1987
and took effect with that year's graduating class. The Minnesota
district includes eight municipalities and has about 1,700 students
attending one high school.

   A professional clown won't have to pay
through the nose for leaving on a comic disguise at a recent
sheriff's roadblock.
   Although the state attorney's office refused to dismiss it as a
laughing matter, a spokesman said Tuesday that Nancy Cherrington
should not be prosecuted under a law that prohibits wearing a mask
or hood in public.
   She was accused of wearing a plastic nose in public and
disobeying a deputy and faced up to 18 months in jail and up to
$1,500 in fines.
   The 45-year-old Geneva homemaker and professional clown, was
arrested during a roadblock at an apartment complex, where
authorities suspected the drug trade was growing.
   Cherrington had been visiting friends when she was stopped. And
because she often wears a clown nose out in public, she thought she
would try it out on Orange County deputies. But deputies were not
amused when she refused to remove her nose, which was attached to
yellow sunglasses.
   ``I feel better,'' she said after the charges were dropped. ``I
was a little worried.''
   The law would apply to Cherrington only if she had been trying to
conceal her identity, the state attorney's statement said.
``Traditional holiday costumes'' also are exempt from the law.
   Cherrington had planned to wear one of her many clown noses in
court.
   ``I pop on my nose for everybody _ I'm not prejudiced,'' she
said. ``I love the reaction when I put my nose on.''

<TEXT>
   Pete Rose and Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti
reached a compromise Wednesday calling for the Cincinnati manager to
be suspended indefinitely from baseball for betting on his own team,
sources said.
   The exact terms of the settlement were not known, but Rose may
apply for reinstatement after one year with no guarantees his
petition will be granted, sources said.
   There were reports that the Cincinnati manager would be out of
baseball for as many as five years but one source said there was no
definite length.
   Giamatti announced Wednesday night that he would hold a news
conference in New York at 9 a.m. Thursday. However, the commissioner
did not say officially what the news conference would be about.
   Rose scheduled a 10 a.m. EDT news conference Thursday at
Riverfront Stadium. Rose did not address the gambling allegations
but spoke of his new daughter Cara, born Tuesday. ``Tyler wanted a
baby sister so everything is going to be good,'' Rose said.
   Sources familiar with the case told The Associated Press that the
news conference will involve Rose's suspension. However, the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, were not sure of the
length of the suspension.
   Several baseball sources said Giamatti pushed for a settlement
because he was afraid the case would continue to linger in court,
preventing him from disciplining Rose.
   The sources said Rose needed to settle because he believed
Giamatti ultimately would suspend him once Rose exhausted legal
appeals. That need increased once baseball successfully moved the
case into federal court.
   Rose, under investigation since Feb. 20, obtained a temporary
restraining order from an Ohio state court on June 25 which
prevented Giamatti from holding a hearing on the gambling
allegations.
   Rose was accused by bookmakers and other acquaintances of betting
on baseball, including Reds games. Investigators for baseball
compiled a 225-page report that alleged Rose bet on the Reds from
1985-87 and cited evidence that included betting slips allegedly in
Rose's handwriting, and telephone and bank records.
   A hearing on Rose's request for a preliminary injunction is
scheduled to begin on Monday in federal court in Columbus, Ohio.
   Reds owner Marge Schott, contacted at home Wednesday night, said
she had received no word from the commissioner's office about the
news conference.
   ``I know nothing about what's cooking,'' she said. ``I'm going to
wait for tomorrow and see what happens.''

<HEAD>Consolidated Church Sees Bright Future But Temporary Pains</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the newly merged Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America said they were loaded with confidence for
the future despite some pressing financial constraints.
   Representatives of the 5.3-million member denomination heard
reports that revenues were running short for budgeted churchwide
programs.
   ``The short-range picture for this church is one of painful
adjustment, and in some cases, severe retrenchment,'' presiding
Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom said.
   Nevertheless, the ``long-range story is a good one,'' he said.
   ``Our future is secure and bright once we get beyond these
difficult start-up years,'' Chilstrom said Wednesday night at the
opening business session of the church's first national assembly.
   Formed of three previous Lutheran bodies, the denomination is the
nation's fourth largest Protestant church after Southern Baptists,
United Methodists and the mainly black National Baptist Convention.
   The sober discussion of budgetary problems contrasted with a
stirring worship service that opened the eight-day meeting earlier
Wednesday.
   Amid prayers, Scripture readings and antiphonally sung hymns
bounced back and forth between men, women and a black children's
choir, about 2,000 people partook of the consecrated wine and bread
at O'Hare Exposition Center.
   A huge white panel over the podium proclaimed the theme of the
meeting _ ``Many Voices, One Song.''
   Chilstrom expressed hope that the initial legislative work would
produce a sense of cohesiveness and identity and ``set the pattern''
for the future.
   ``We are like a ship setting out into the deep,'' he said. ``If
we set the wrong course _ even by a few degrees _ it will mean that
future assemblies will have to make major corrections.''
   Launched at the start of 1988, the church had a shortfall of
$15.8 million its first 14 months, when expenditures totaled $104.3
million. Continuing revenue shortages forced a cut in 1989
expenditures from $99.3 million to $92.3 million.
   Chilstrom said congregational support for missionaries, campus
ministry, parochial schools, seminaries and various urban and rural
programs ``is not what it should be.''
   Members in 1988 contributed a total of $1.3 billion, up 4.6
percent from the year before and slightly outpacing a 4.4 percent
inflation rate, but the $118 million channeled on to synod and
national programs was down.
   The Rev. Lowell G. Almen, church secretary, reported the number
of Asian, black and Hispanic members rose by 11 percent last year,
now amounting to 1.8 percent of the predominantly white church. The
church has set a goal of raising minority membership to at least 10
percent by the end of its first decade.
   Overall membership, however, sagged slightly, Almen said. ``The
back door of our congregations seems larger than our front door.''

   Forget about fly swatters. An 81-year-old Beijing
retiree lays traps and kills flies wholesale _ 700,000 over the past
decade.
   Hu Changfu does it for fun and profit, the official Xinhua News
Agency said Wednesday.
   ``When I see the flies flying into the cage, I feel a sense of
happiness,'' it quoted Hu as saying.
   He kills 4,000 a day during the ``fly-killing season'' from April
to October, and gets about one-hundredth of a U.S. cent for each
carcass from the neighborhood sanitary committee.
   Hu's record was 5.6 pounds of flies _ about 102,000 _ in May,
when student pro-democracy protesters jammed the streets and
hampered garbage pickup.
   His method is to put a fly trap resembling a bird cage near the
garbage cans and the public toilet on his lane, and bait it with
hairtail fish, a fly favorite.
   Xinhua recently has displayed special interest in insects.
   It reported Tuesday that Inner Mongolia's capital, Hohhot, was
declared China's first cockroach-free city.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping has likened Western liberal ideas to
flies that come in China's open window, but the reports on insect
killing did not appear to have political significance.

   With U.S. schools projected to soak up a record
$353 billion for the new school year, Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos and other educators disagree on whether students are
benefiting.
   ``Our nation continues to make a tremendous financial investment
in education but the education deficit continues to grow,'' Cavazos
said Wednesday, and ``too many Americans remain ill-prepared for a
changing world.''
   Cavazos released the department's annual statistical forecast for
the 1989-90 school year, showing that all levels of public and
private education will spend about $353 billion in state, federal
and local dollars.
   The education spending will amount to 6.8 percent of the gross
national product and will exceed the Bush administration's proposed
1990 national defense budget of $303 billion, said Cavazos.
   The $353 billion is 6.8 percent more than last year's overall
spending of $330 billion.
   But Education Department officials point to the dismal
performance of American youth on academic achievement tests,
particularly in areas such as math and science that are considered
critical in a fast-changing technical society.
   In most instances, Americans scored near the bottom in both math
and science when compared with dozens of other industrial nations.
   Mary Futrell, outgoing president of the National Education
Association, attributed the increasing costs of education to a rapid
rise in the number of children living in poverty.
   ``As you get more children who are poor into the school systems,
you get more deficiencies, and students whose needs are different
and greater,'' said Mrs. Futrell, explaining that the report fails
to ``accurately reflect the diversity of students'' _ children of
recent immigrants who don't speak English and those from poor or
single-parent families.
   ``So it costs more to educate those children,'' she added.
   Ann Lynch, president of the National Parents and Teachers
Association, headquartered in Chicago, said the huge investment in
education shows ``commitment even though all the students' needs are
not being met.''
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers,
bristled at Cavazos' use of the term ``education deficit.''
   ``We have many educational problems because we're suffering from
a leadership deficit,'' said Shanker. ``It is the leadership deficit
that's at the bottom of the educational deficit.''
   President Bush has called an ``education summit'' Sept. 27-28 in
Charlottesville, Va., with the nation's governors, and Cavazos said
the meeting was a ``historic step ... to address this national
crisis.''
   ``Such leadership is critical,'' Cavazos said, ``but parents,
teachers _ indeed, all Americans _ must become involved if we are to
ensure that each student has an opportunity to be educated to his or
her fullest potential.''
   Among the major conclusions in the report:
   _Spending on higher education will increase the most, to $141
billion, up 7.2 percent from the $131.4 billion spent last year.
Once adjusted for inflation, that represents a 36 percent increase
since the 1980-81 school year.
   _Expenditures for each full-time, higher education student will
rise to $14,923, nearly $750 more per student than a year ago.
   _Costs for public and private elementary and secondary schools
are expected to rise to $212 billion, a 6.6 percent increase over
last year's $199.1 billion. After inflation, that is a 29 percent
gain since 1980-81.
   _Expenditures for each elementary and secondary school student
are expected to reach a record high of $5,246, $308 per student more
than last year.
   _The average salary of public elementary and secondary school
teachers is expected to rise to $31,200, up 5.5 percent over last
year's average of $29,567. After inflation, that will amount to a 20
percent increase since 1980-81.
   While educational costs continue to increase, total enrollment in
the nation's schools and colleges will rise only slightly, up by
400,000 for a total of 58.7 million this fall. About 45.6 million
young people will attend elementary and secondary schools, and 13.1
million students will attend higher education institutions.
   Peterson's, a Princeton, N.J., education and career information
company, said a recent survey found that 224 of the nation's most
competitive colleges experienced an average enrollment decline of
1.6 percent. The company said public institutions' freshmen declined
by 3.4 percent, while independent institutions increased their
enrollment slightly by 0.6 percent.
   The Education Department projected a decrease of 178,000 high
school graduates for the spring of 1990, bringing the total to 2.6
million. The trend has been generally downward since the peak year
of 1977 when nearly 3.2 million students received diplomas.

<TEXT>
   Federal officials say they'll decide soon
whether to give in to residents of a small west Texas city who
oppose a proposal to conduct a series of high-powered underground
explosions nearby.
   Officials of the Defense Nuclear Agency met Wednesday with Texas
congressional aides, who said they were told a decision will be made
within 10 days on whether to drop consideration of the Buck King
Ranch 25 miles north of Del Rio, Texas, as a possible site for the
explosions.
   The proposed non-nuclear explosions are intended to simulate the
impact of nuclear blasts on subterranean missile silos and evaluate
the sturdiness of U.S. and Soviet deep-underground command and
control facilities.
   Residents of the arid Texas city say they're concerned the blasts
might endanger their only source of drinking water, the San Felipe
Springs.
   Defense spokeswoman Cheri Abdelnour said the Pentagon agency is
awaiting the results of tests on core samples drilled at the site to
assess the geology.
   ``We're pushing hard for a decision and we expect to have
something in two weeks,'' she said.
   Del Rio officials want the agency to immediately abandon
consideration of the Buck King Ranch. Last week, Mayor Alfred
Gutierrez and City Manager Jeffrey Pomeranz presented top Defense
Nuclear Agency officials with petitions signed by 12,000 of the
city's 40,000 residents opposed to the explosions.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, whose staff met Wednesday with DNA
officials, said the agency has told him that data from the area is
still being evaluated and a final determination will be made within
a week to 10 days.
   Larry Neal, a spokesman for Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the
officials indicated they were concerned ``about the level of
opposition that has developed in Del Rio and that it will be a
factor in their decision.''
   The graduated series of explosions would start with a 1,000-pound
charge in 1990, increasing to 470-ton charge, an equivalent of 300
tons of TNT, in November 1992.
   The DNA said the explosions were designed to have no significant
environmental impact, and they would not affect archeological sites
near the Buck King Ranch.

<HEAD>Movie `Casualties of War' Gives Distorted Picture, Veterans' Groups
Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The movie ``Casualties of War'' presents a
distorted picture of the Vietnam war and is ``a lie about what we
were really like in Vietnam,'' says the former chairman of the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund.
   The film ``depicts vets as morally insensitive, barely competent
soldiers with cynical and cowardly officers,'' John Wheeler,
president of the Center for the Vietnam Generation, said Wednesday.
   The film maligns Vietnam veterans by exploiting ``false
stereotypes'' about American fighting men in the Southeast Asian
conflict, he said at a news conference. ``Every dollar spent to see
this film is a knife in the heart of some vet, his kids or others
who love him,'' he said.
   The movie, starring Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn and directed by
Brian De Palma, is based on a true story and tells of an Army squad
that kidnaps, repeatedly rapes and then murders a Vietnamese girl.
   ``By focusing on a rape, De Palma declines to tell the greater
truth, that in Vietnam the overwhelming number of us were decent,
built orphanages, roads, hospitals and schools,'' said Wheeler, who
served as an officer in Vietnam. ``It is a lie about what we were
really like in Vietnam.''
   Wheeler was joined at the news conference by Marc Leepson,
speaking on behalf of Vietnam Veterans of America.
   Leepson said that ``in recent years we've gotten movies and TV
shows depicting the war more realistically, less sensationally, and
showing vets who are not just cartoon characters and cliched
stereotypes. Now, thanks to Brian De Palma, the cinematic image of
those who fought in Vietnam has taken a giant step backward.''
   ``The unspoken message of `Casualties of War' is that the norm in
Vietnam was rape and murder, and that only a brave handful of GIs
acted humanely. That message is 180 degrees from the truth,'' he
said.
   Peggy Siegal, a New York-based publicist for De Palma, said when
asked about the criticism: ``We have no comment.''
   The publicity office of Columbia Pictures, which distributed the
movie, declined to provide any comment on the remarks by Wheeler and
Leepson.
   From 1979 until this year Wheeler served as chairman of the fund
that sponsored the design and construction of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial on the Mall in Washington.
   The Center for the Vietnam Generation, based in suburban McLean,
Va., describes itself as a non-profit organization that fosters
knowledge about the 60 million Americans who came of age in the
Vietnam era.

   The Yugoslavian weekly Danas raised the issue following months of
rumors that Romania is building nuclear weapons. Speculation
heightened in April when Ceausescu said his country has the
potential to manufacture the arms.
   ``There always are insane people who speculate,'' Danas quoted
Ceausescu as saying. ``I do not even wish to discuss this, to lower
myself to such a level.''
   The weekly also asked the Romanian leader what he does for
recreation, and quoted him as saying he likes watching the U.S.
detective series ``Kojak.'' But, the leader was quoted as saying,
``My hobby is achieving socialism in Romania.''

   Masked Palestinians with knives and axes
abducted an Israeli check collector in the occupied West Bank town
of Tulkarem, Israel radio said Thursday.
   Police and troops launched searches in Tulkarem and the
surrounding Arab villages for the missing man, the radio said.
   An army spokeswoman confirmed that an unidentified man had
reported the kidnapping to Tulkarem police on Wednesday night and
that troops were searching but could provide no further details.
   The Israeli, whose name was not given, went to Tulkarem in an
Arab taxi to collect money from a local merchant Wednesday evening,
the radio said.
   Army radio said security forces had not ruled out a criminal
motive in the abduction.
   An army spokeswoman who can not be identified under military
rules told the Associated Press: ``We have a report from local
residents that a person who came to collect checks has been
kidnapped.
   ``The army is carrying out widespread searches and we are
checking information,'' she said.
   The army sealed off the area of Tulkarem on Thursday.
   Israel radio said masked Arab youths wielding knives and axes had
the Arab cab driver take the car down an alleyway, then forced the
Israeli out. They told the driver to wait for the man's return, it
said.
   The driver reported the incident to Israeli police in Tulkarem,
and police forces began combing the town and surrounding villages,
the radio said.

<HEAD>Brewers at Odds with Coalition Over Ads Aimed at Minorities</HEAD>

   A public interest coalition says brewers should
halt glitzy malt liquor ads that target blacks and Hispanics, but an
industry group says there's nothing ``sinister'' about the ad
campaign.
   ``We make no apologies for marketing a malt liquor, or for the
fact that this particular product is especially popular in the black
and Hispanic markets,'' said Stephen J. Burrows, a vice president of
St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch, which makes ``King Cobra'' malt
liquor.
   Industry representatives say malt liquor is advertised more
heavily in the black and Hispanic communities because it is popular
there. They also point to various reports, including one from the
Federal Trade Commission, discounting any link between alcohol
advertising and alcohol abuse.
   However, the coalition of 22 health and community groups formed
around the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public
Interest wants government to limit the alcohol content of malt
liquor to 5 percent and pressure brewers into stopping ads targeted
at the two minority groups.
   ``As physicians who encounter all too many alcohol-related
problems in our offices and emergency rooms, we know that malt
liquor is a faster way to get drunk or destroy your liver,'' said
Dr. Walter L. Faggett, a District of Columbia physician speaking for
the black National Medical Association.
   ``Not only are malt liquor products harmful themselves, but like
wine coolers and other alcohol beverages they are `gateway' drugs
that pave the way to crack cocaine, heroin and polysubstance
addiction,'' he said.
   The Beer Institute, an industry group, defended the ads.
   ``There is nothing at all unusual or sinister about marketers
tailoring their marketing campaigns to particular market segments.''
   Peter Bell, executive director of the Minneapolis-based Institute
on Black Chemical Abuse, said at a Wednesday news conference that
blacks, who make up 10 percent of the U.S. population, consume
one-third of all malt liquor.
   ``The central question we must focus on is the fragile nature of
the black community today,'' Bell said. ``Can we afford to have
aggressive marketing campaigns targeted toward it? There's not one
issue on the black agenda _ housing, health care, crime, education _
that is not negatively impacted by alcohol and drug abuse.''
   Carlos Molina, president of the Latino Caucus of the American
Public Health Association, criticized the ads for exploiting and
perpetuating ``another Latino stereotype: `super macho.'''
   The coalition is asking Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to
restrict the alcohol content of malt liquor to 5 percent.
   Beer generally has a 4.6 percent alcohol content, while malt
liquor begins at 5.6 percent and one brand contains 10.9 percent,
although most are under 7 percent.
   CSPI, a non-profit advocacy group that normally concerns itself
with general health issues, has been criticizing the advertising
practices of the nation's breweries, saying they target young men as
well.
   The issue has been in the forefront since then-Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop said in a May report on drunk driving that
youth-oriented advertising and other promotional practices appealing
to youth should be restricted.
   The industry, through the Beer Institute and individual
corporations, maintains it's putting money back into the community
through contributions to education and other activities.
   Burrows said Anheuser-Busch has contributed $65 million over the
last 10 years to the United Negro College Fund and the Hispanic
Scholarship Foundation.

<HEAD>Extradition of Drug Suspects Easier Said than Done</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   U.S. efforts to extradite suspected criminals
hiding in other countries frequently fail, in large part because the
suspects can't be found or other nations are reluctant to arrest
them, officials say.
   Federal officials last year requested the return of 253 citizens
and foreigners wanted in the United States for crimes ranging from
drug trafficking to money laundering, according to the State
Department.
   Only 73 were forced back.
   ``It takes time to get these people,'' a State Department
official said Wednesday. ``Also, when we ask for someone to be
arrested, that doesn't mean they can always be found.''
   The Justice Department issued a most-wanted list Tuesday for a
dozen Colombian men charged with drug-related crimes in the United
States. But bringing such suspects to American soil for trial is
rare.
   ``In most cases the fugitives can't be found. That certainly is
the case in Colombia,'' said the State Department official who,
following department rules, spoke on the condition of not being
further identified.
   The situation in Colombia is further complicated by the
reluctance of judges and magistrates there to anger the nation's
powerful drug cartels, which have assassinated hundreds of jurists
and politicians who dared to oppose them.
   The latest such incident occurred last week with the murder of
presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan, who had promised a
government crackdown on drug traffickers.
   The only notable extradition from Colombia came in 1987, when
cocaine smuggling kingpin Carlos Lehder was arrested in Colombia and
brought to the United States within hours. Lehder, charged with
conspiring to import 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United States, was
sentenced to life imprisonment here.
   Another Colombian, Juan Ramon Matta, was nabbed in Honduras by
U.S. officials in 1988 and whisked out of the country to the United
States. But that action prompted violent anti-American
demonstrations because Honduras did not have an extradition treaty
with the United States.
   Matta is jailed on drug charges in connection with the 1985
torture-murder in Mexico of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
agent Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   Despite those successes, the State Department official said,
extradition remains ``a complex and expensive procedure.''
   The process starts with formal charges against a person who is
overseas. The case then goes to the Justice Department, which asks
the State Department to request that the host country arrest the
suspect.
   Local authorities normally must decide whether to make the arrest
and whether to permit the person to be deported.
   The State Department official said there is no master list
breaking down the types of crimes those on the U.S. extradition list
face in the United States.
   ``It's not like a 10-most-wanted list,'' said Justice Department
spokesman Joe Krovisky. ``We go after them as the requests come in.''
   Krovisky said the Justice Department normally will not identify
the people it seeks abroad, saying: ``That information is not
released until the person is returned to the United States or the
case is made public in the other country.''
   A spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of International
Narcotics Matters confirmed that the United States is seeking the
extradition of ``four or five people from Pakistan for drugs,'' but
she had no other information on the cases or other countries.
   Pakistan is one of the world's main suppliers of high-grade
heroin. The State Department says Pakistani opium production last
year was more than 200 tons.
   Neither the State nor Justice departments would release
information about traffickers operating in the remote ``Golden
Triangle,'' the heroin-rich region where Burma, Thailand and Laos
share a border.
   In some cases, most notably in Panama, the United States has
virtually no chance of having someone extradited to America soil.
Panama and the United States don't have an extradition treaty.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the de facto leader of Panama, was
indicted on drug trafficking charges in Florida in 1988, and leaders
of Colombian drug cartels are reported to have gone to Panama during
an earlier extradition scare in their home country in the mid-1980s.

<HEAD>CBO Raises Cost Estimate Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cost estimates for the first five years of
coverage for catastrophic illnesses under Medicare are being
increased from $30 billion to $45 billion by the Congressional
Budget Office, a congressional aide says.
   The estimates prompted Rep. Harris Fawell, R-Ill., to write a
``Dear Colleague'' letter to all members of the House repeating his
arguments that the program should be repealed, Fawell aide Tracy
King said Wednesday.
   Fawell is vacationing in Michigan and could not be reached, Ms.
King said. The spokesman for the Congressional Budget Office didn't
answer his telephone Wednesday night.
   Much of the new insurance program's financing comes from an
income tax surtax of up to 15 percent of income tax liability over
$150, with a ceiling of $800 a year. The surtax applies only to the
richest 40 percent of older eligible Americans.
   The charges have prompted bitter denunciations from lobbies for
the elderly, and Congress is wrestling with proposed revisions.
   The higher estimates result mostly from an upward revision in the
cost of skilled nursing home care, originally estimated at $1
billion a year. An Aug. 7 CBO memo raised the estimate to $2.4
billion a year, and a later update put it at $3.6 billion a year,
Ms. King said.
   She said CBO plans to publish an updated memo on costs next month.
   The Health Care Financing Administration, part of the Department
of Health and Human Services, estimates the cost at $4.4 billion a
year.
   Higher estimates for drug costs account for the rest of the
higher CBO estimate, Ms. King said.
   Fawell argues that ``a repeal is the only way you can do
anything; the program was flawed from the start.''
   The House Ways and Means Committee had approved a measure that
would, among other things, cut the surtax in half, to 7.5 percent,
keeping a ceiling of $800. The rate and the ceiling would increase
gradually through 1993.
   The committee provision also would permit Medicare participants
to opt out of catastrophic coverage as long as they also dropped
Medicare Part B, which covers physicians' fees.
   The Senate has not acted on the question, preferring to let the
House take the initiative.

<TEXT>
   Rejecting U.S. appeals for a tougher stance,
the Organization of American States approved a statement early today
expressing deep concern over the failure of an OAS mediating team to
promote a democratic transfer of power in Panama.
   The statement approved by OAS foreign ministers after 12 hours of
marathon closed-door negotiations ``resolutely exhorts'' Panamanians
to settle their differences before Sept. 1. That is the date on
which the Panamanian constitution calls for the installation of a
new president.
   The United States joined the 30 other OAS members in approving
the statement at 12:28 a.m. EDT even though the document did not
demand that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega step down as commander of
Panama's military forces.
   That has been a consistent U.S. position for 18 months, but many
other OAS members believe an endorsement of that stance could set a
dangerous precedent. They see the U.S. position as a violation of
OAS provisions barring intervention in the internal affairs of
member countries.
   During the meeting, which started shortly after noon and extended
until after midnight, a number of draft statements were circulated
among delegates assembled at the ornate OAS headquarters building a
few blocks from the State Department.
   But all met with resistance from both the U.S. and Panamanian
delegates. In the end, the delegates approved a simple
five-paragraph resolution that offended no one but said little.
   The plenary session had been scheduled to get under way at 3 p.m.
Wednesday but it wasn't gaveled to order until 12:21 a.m. today.
Approval of the statement came seven minutes later.
   The delegates expressed ``deep concern'' that parties to Panama's
political conflict have been unable to reach a solution and said the
mediating team would be available for additional consultations upon
request.
   Afterward, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter credited the
four OAS mediators with getting a dialogue started among Panamanian
officials and opposition leaders.
   But the chief U.S. delegate, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger, said that until democracy is restored in Panama, each
member of the 31-nation OAS has an obligation ``to isolate this
outlaw regime.''
   He said Noriega's purported alliance with cocaine traffickers is
aggression ``as surely as Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland 50 years
ago was aggression.'' Two Florida grand juries indicted Noriega last
year on drug trafficking charges.
   The Panamanian crisis erupted in May when authorities threw out
the results of a national election which, according to independent
observers, had been won handily by the anti-Noriega candidate,
Guillermo Endara. The OAS mediation effort was approved a week after
the election results were voided.
   Wednesday's meeting was the fourth time in four months that the
foreign ministers gathered here to discuss the crisis. In the
interim, the mediators made numerous trips to Panama attempting to
hammer out a solution.
   In the absence of an agreement, it is unclear what will happen in
Panama on Sept. 1, the date when an ``elected president'' is due to
take office.
   Ritter told reporters Wednesday night the government has a strong
incentive to reach an agreement with the opposition before that date
in order to satisfy the country's constitutional requirements.
   The mediating team issued a report to the ministers Wednesday
expressing optimism that a restoration of democratic rule in Panama
may be within reach.
   But State Department officials said there was no basis for any
such a conclusion and a Panamanian opposition leader, Ricardo Arias
Calderon, called the mediation effort a failure because Noriega
refused to negotiate in good faith.
   State Department officials objected not only to the positive tone
of the report but also to its criticism of U.S. policy toward
Panama. The report called attention to the ``negative effect'' on
the negotiations ``of the maneuvers carried out by the armed forces
of the United States'' in Panama. U.S. military personnel in Panama
numbers about 10,000.
   A State Department official, speaking privately, expressed
irritation that the report singled out the United States for
criticism without mentioning Noriega by name at any point in the
report.

<TEXT>
   The 1950s were a time of innocence, says poet
S.A. Griffin, when people such as beat writers Jack Kerouac and Neal
Cassidy could pack up a big old car and head down the road just to
see what was there.
   ``It's time for someone to do it again,'' Griffin said shortly
before he and four other poets piled into a rusty, white 1959
Cadillac for a three-week reading tour across the Southwest.
   ``I feel it's very important to do this,'' said Griffin, 35, a
lean, muscular man who wears rose-colored glasses, painter's caps
and bears a strong resemblance to his hero Cassidy, the real-life
star of Kerouac's beat novel ``On the Road.''
   ``It could inspire someone else to realize how big this poetry
thing is,'' he said.
   The poetry thing Griffin refers to is what he and his fellow
travelers _ Michael Brunner, Doug Knott, Bobbo Staron and Scott
Wannberg _ say is a booming beat scene that has emerged in Los
Angeles.
   Thus the five have put together the Karma Bums tour and are
spreading their words in clubs in Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Taos,
N.M., Denver and Boulder, Colo., and San Francisco before returning
home for an end-of-tour reading in September.
   Once upon a time, performance art was common in cities like San
Francisco and New York, said Wannberg, whose second book, ``The
Electric Yes Indeed,'' has just been published by Shelf Life Press.
   Now, he said, the scene has shifted to Southern California, which
was once looked upon by the other big cities as a cultural abyss.
   ``It seems to have fizzled in San Francisco,'' added Wannberg, a
big, bearish man who talks in the same dramatic Charles
Bukowski-influenced tones in which he writes. ``There is definitely
more happening here now than many people would admit to.''
   Readings are around town just about every night, noted Wannberg,
36, who has read locally for more than a dozen years.
   They take place in venues that include both trendy West Side
bistros, where celebrities sometimes read their works, and gritty
biker bars, where the performers must vie with noisy drunks for the
audience's attention.
   Much of what gets read in both places, Wannberg acknowledged, is
patently awful. Some of it, however, is also quite good, he was
quick to add.
   ``But if we're having a poetry renaissance, I don't think it's a
renaissance that's actually recognized by most of the rest of the
country,'' he saidr is one small, free-form effort to change that,
said Griffin.
   As they do in Los Angeles, the poets reciteheir work from appear
in clubs in one city after another. Often they act out their work on
stage as well.
   They say they hope the audience joins in whenever it feels the
massive in the United States,'' Griffin said. ``But too many peple
turn their backs on it because cliques existither somebody at a
reading or somebody with a master's degree telling them about
Shakespeare.''
   Or, as Knrned-poet, quipped just before the tour kicked off
Friday amid the thumping of bongo drums at os Angeles club: ``Poets
are those guys with skinny chests who can't play guitars very well.''
   The audience _ largely bearded, buckskin-jacketed and middle-aged
_ howled its approval.

<HEAD>Drug Helps Women Stop Pulling Out Their Hair</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Millions of Americans plagued by an uncontrollable
impulse to yank out their hair can get control of their bizarre
habit and stop themselves from going bald by taking a new medicine,
researchers report today.
   Experts say it has become evident in recent years that this
affliction is common, even though most victims keep it secret by
wearing wigs or fake eye brows.
   In a report in the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors show
that an experimental drug called clomipramine can help people reduce
their hair pulling and sometimes stop it entirely.
   The drug ``allows them to say `no,''' said Dr. Susan E. Swedo.
``They still have the urge, but their ability to resist it
increased.''
   No one knows precisely how many people pull out their hair, a
disorder known as trichotillomania. Estimates range as high as 8
million Americans, although Swedo said that between 2 million and 4
million is probably more accurate. Virtually all of them are women.
   Researchers said that hair pulling has been poorly recognized, in
part, because victims are adept at hiding the consequences of their
obsession. While many wear wigs, others lie that they are bald
because they take chemotherapy. Some who have a fringe of hair comb
the remaining strands over the top, just as balding men do.
   ``They are convinced that they are crazy,'' said Swedo. ``They
have to do this thing that is painful and disgusting, yet they
continue. They struggle against it all their lives.''
   Victims of the obsession, which frequently starts just after
puberty, often don't realize they have a treatable disorder that
affects millions of people. In fact, nine of the patients who took
part in the latest study sought doctors' help after learning about a
related ailment known as obsessive-compulsive disorder on a
television report last year.
   Swedo, a researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health,
tested clomipramine on 13 women. Three completely stopped pulling
their hair, while the rest had at least a 50 percent reduction in
the severity of their symptoms.
   The same drug has also been shown in other studies to be
effective in helping people with obsessive-compulsive disorder. The
medicine has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for routine use. However, doctors can obtain it from
its maker, Ciba-Geigy, for treating severe cases.
   A newly approved drug called fluoxetine, or Prozac, also appears
to be effective against obsessive-compulsive disorder and hair
pulling, although it has not been as widely tested as clomipramine.
   Dr. Michael A. Jenike of Massachusetts General Hospital said that
until the development of these medicines, obsessive-compulsive
disorder ``was considered to be untreatable. Now we can get many
people completely better or at least well enough so they can
function. It's not an exaggeration to call this a breakthrough.''
   The Obsessive Compulsive Foundation estimates that as many as 5
million Americans have the anxiety disorder. Typically, they have
irrational compulsions to do something over and over, such as wash
their hands or make sure the door is locked. They may wash for five
hours a day or check the door 50 or 60 times, even though they
realize the repetition is senseless.
   Both clomipramine and fluoxetine can also be used to treat
depression. The drugs appear to relieve hair pulling and other
obsessive behavior by increasing the brain's supply of a chemical
messenger known as serotonin.
   In the latest study, patients successively took clomipramine and
another depression medicine called desipramine. While they got
markedly better on clomipramine, the other drug had little effect.
   Swedo said that clomipramine may work best when combined with
behavior modification training.
   ``You can decrease symptoms by half or three-quarters and still
be bald,'' she said. ``You just don't pull so fast. We don't mean to
imply that clomipramine is the only treatment.''

<HEAD>Study Links Lack of Health Insurance with Risky Births</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Babies born into families without medical insurance
are more likely to start life in poor health, probably because of
limited access to care, a study reported today concludes.
   The research found that those whose parents have no insurance are
about one-third more likely than those from insured families to die
or be seriously ill at birth.
   The study was not designed to definitely pinpoint the cause.
However, the authors said they believe that ``the elevated and
increasing risks of adverse outcomes in uninsured newborns are
explained most plausibly by diminished access to care, together with
other factors related to lower socio-economic status.''
   The study was based on a review of the records of more than
146,000 births in the San Francisco Bay area in 1982, 1984 and 1986.
During that time, the percentage of newborns without health
insurance increased from 5.5 percent to 8 percent. The increases
were largest among people of Hispanic and Asian backgrounds.
   By 1986, the chance of an adverse hospital outcome _ defined as a
prolonged hospital stay, transfer to another hospital or death _ was
31 percent greater among the uninsured babies, even when racial and
ethnic differences were taken into account.
   The study was directed by Dr. Paula Braveman of the University of
California, San Francisco, and published in today's New England
Journal of Medicine.
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Donald M. Berwick of the
Harvard Community Health Plan and Howard H. Hiatt of Brigham and
Women's Hospital said they doubted that insurance alone would close
the gap.
   ``The relations between poverty and poor health are too deep and
intricate to be disrupted with a mere insurance form,'' they wrote.
   Among the study's other findings:
   _In 1986, 20 percent of Hispanic newborns were uninsured,
compared with 3 percent of blacks, 6 percent of whites and 12
percent of Asians.
   _Uninsured blacks were more than twice as likely as insured
blacks to have sickly newborns.
   _Babies who required transfer to another hospital ran up bills
averaging nearly $56,000.
   _Low birth weight and malnutrition were 28 percent more common in
newborns without insurance.

   If U.S. and South Korean forces

   In their eyes, the chances of that happening have not faded
despite 36 years of peace for the 300,000 residents of Kaeson City,
five miles from the demilitarized zone that divides communist North
Korea from the capitalist, U.S.-backed South.
   ``The South makes provocative actions on the air and sea,'' said
Chun Gi-hyon, secretary of the city People's Committee. ``All Kaeson
City residents live very vigilantly.''
   If this is vigilance, it is low-keyed. Residents stroll by ones
and twos down willow-shaded streets. Those working in vegetable
fields near the center of town pause frequently from hoeing to rest.
   Small children splash in shallow streams while their mothers
scrub clothes on the rocks. Dozens of soldiers walk about in
uniform, but they too have a leisurely look.
   ``I'm not afraid,'' said a woman selling clothing in a department
store, ``because all Korean people are united'' against attack.
   No peace treaty has been signed, although an armistice in 1953
ended three years of fighting that devastated the Korean peninsula.
The two sides recently made tentative contacts, and relations have
improved between their superpower allies. But Chun dismissed these
developments.
   ``The situation is tense,'' he said. Kaeson City has no militia
but authorities ``have taken measures to save people's lives'' and
property in case of attack from the South, Chun said but refused to
give details.
   Asked if the city held air raid or other defensive drills, he
again demurred, saying, ``I am a civilian, not a military man.'' But
Chun said the city joined the rest of the nation in twice-yearly
black-out drills.
   To a visitor, however, Kaeson seems less focused on war than on
tourism. Dozens of tourists _ most from socialist countries _ pass
through daily to see Panmunjom, where the armistice was signed.
   Official tourist brochures advertise Kaeson as a major producer
of the ginseng root, alleged to increase energy. They praise its
scenic mountains and waterfalls.
   Lt. Col. Yun Ki Un, a member of the Military Armistice Commission
that administers the truce, said he envisions Panmunjom being turned
into a museum after a peace treaty finally is signed.
   But meanwhile, he too insisted that the border situation ``grows
more tense continually.''
   He cited the South's refusal to give permission for a South
Korean student who traveled illegally to the North to return home
across the border. She crossed Aug. 15 and was taken into custody,
but no shots were fired by either side during the crossing, which
the North turned into a political rally.
   Aside from a few peasants who are allowed to farm inside the
mile-deep portion of the demilitarized zone under Northern control,
ordinary North Koreans appear not to have access to the zone or
truce village.
   The way is blocked by an iron-bar fence guarded by armed soldiers
and two large floodlights. Electrified barbed wire lines part of the
road inside the zone, and Yun acknowledged that the zone itself is
mined.
   The 46-year-old Yun said he had learned in 20 years of border
duty that ``if (the U.S.) government decides something in connection
with the Korean question, you can feel it here immediately.''
   American soldiers stationed at the border as part of the U.N.
force that aided the South in the war ``always feel hostility and
act like that,'' Yun said. Sometimes, he said, they hold their
pistols in a threatening way or pat their holsters.
   The South, in turn, accuses the North of provocative behavior,
and the two governments regularly exchange heated words.
   For all that, the last violent incident at Panmunjom was in 1984,
when, according to Yun, the U.N. Command on the southern side
``captured one of our tourists, from the U.S.S.R.''
   The U.N. Command said the Soviet defected by running across the
demarcation line, and that rifle-toting North Korean guards crossed
in pursuit. U.N. guards opened fire, killing four North Koreans.
   Yun said he has become friends with officers from such neutral
countries as Switzerland and Sweden who also are stationed at
Panmunjom. ``Why not?'' he said, adding that they sometimes share a
drink.
   With American officers, such comraderie is rarer. But sometimes,
he said, ``when I meet with Americans in uniform I can find them
personally friendly.''
   Perhaps someday, he said, ``we can meet each other with smiles.''

<HEAD>Wildlife Federation Takes Its Case To Appeals Court</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: RETRANSMITTING to fix category code.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legal fight over how to protect endangered
sea turtles from drowning in the nets of Gulf Coast shrimpers has
moved into the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   The National Wildlife Federation asked the appeals court here
Wednesday to reinstate a law requiring shrimpers to use devices that
let sea turtles escape their nets.
   The group is challenging Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher's
decision allowing shrimpers to limit trawling time to 105 minutes in
lieu of turtle excluder devices known as TEDs.
   The federation was rebuffed Tuesday by a U.S. District Court
judge, who refused the group's request that shrimpers be required to
immediately return to using TEDs.
   Conservationists argue that only TEDs are effective in preventing
thousands of endangered sea turtles from becoming caught in
shrimpers nets and drowning.
   The temporary regulations on restricted tow times, drafted under
a court order by U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan, are in effect
through Sept. 8, when Mosbacher must issue final rules.
   Mosbacher suspended enforcement of the TEDs regulations July 24
after a weekend of protests by shrimpers who say the devices reduce
their catch and threaten their livelihood.

<NOTE>NTSB Recommends New Safety Devices on Airliner Cargo Doors</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is
recommending the use of ``failsafe'' mechanisms on airliner cargo
door latches to prevent doors from ope and ensure they are properly
closed before takeoffs.
   Nine people aboard a United Airlinesof a plane and killed in
February because of an apparent cargo door failure. The NTSB said
Wednesday that its investigation of that incident shows that the
original design of the doors on Boeing 747 models ``does not profor
the failsafe features intended.''
   The NTSB's seven-page safety recommendation to the Fen
Administration said airliners should have redundant indicators to
directly pinpoint the position of latch cam on the cargo doors.
   The board also recommended torque-limiting devices be installed
on both the manual and electrical drives for cargo door latches to
prevent damage to the lock mechanisms during their operation.
   While saying not determined the cause of the Feb. 24 accident
over the Pacific Ocean, the board said the evidence ``strongly
suggests that the forward cargo door opened in flight and led to the
subsequent damage.''
   Yet to be determined, the board said, is whether the cargo door
was not latched or only partially latched before takeoff or if it
became unlatched.

<NOTE>FTC Rules Against New England Rate Bureau</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission says the New
England Motor Rate Bureau illegally fixed rates charged by carriers
hauling goods in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
   The commission, by a 3-1 vote Wednesday, ordered the Boston-based
bureau to halt its collective rate-making activities in most states
and to cancel within six months all tariffs it has filed in those
states.
   The commission charged NEMRB and its member carriers in 1983,
saying that they hindered competition in Massachusetts, Rhode Island
and New Hampshire.
   The opinion noted that in Massachusetts, the state Department of
Public Utilities didn't exercise its supervisory authority over
rates, subjecting the NEMRB's collective rate paying to federal
``antitrust scrutiny.''
   New Hampshire neither reviews rates nor has the authority to
suspend or reject rates, the FTC noted. In Rhode Island, however,
the laws met the federal requirements for being exempt from federal
antitrust regulation.
   NEMRB offices were closed, and no representative could be
identified to reach after hours for comment.

   The government said it is investigating reports
that Israelis trained assassination squads for drug traffickers in
Colombia.
   One source told The Associated Press that two such mercenaries
were smuggled out of Colombia after the nation's leading
presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, was gunned down
Friday at a political rally. Drug traffickers were blamed for the
slaying.
   The source spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity. He has close ties to Israel's Defense Department and was
involved in an Israeli TV report.
   The Foreign Ministry said the government was investigating
whether Israelis were training hit squads for the notorious Medellin
drug cartel.
   The Israeli government said any citizens involved were acting on
their own illegally, but critics said the actions still could damage
Israel's interests.
   ``It blemishes Israel,'' said Amnon Rubinstein, leader of the
left-wing Shinui Party.
   An NBC News report Tuesday included film purportedly showing
Israelis during training sessions. The film also was shown on
Israeli television.
   Israel TV said the man in the NBC film was identified by Israeli
weapons dealers in Colombia.
   It said Colombia's secret service ordered the weapons dealers to
tell all Israeli army experts involved in training forces for drug
cartels to leave the country immediately after Galan's slaying.
   Shortly after the warning, ``a number of Israelis ... were
hurriedly smuggled from the country,'' the television said.
   The Itim news agency also reported Israeli mercenaries were
spirited out of Colombia after the killing.
   Israeli TV identified three colonels in Israel's military reserve
it said were involved in Colombia: Yair Klein, Avraham Tzadaka and
Yaakov Brine.
   In the NBC film, one man pictured in a group wearing fatigues
could be heard saying in Hebrew that it was a ``good exercise'' and
everything went well.
   Israel television identified that man as Klein.
   A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Klein
commanded the Israeli paratrooper's anti-terror unit in 1983. He
said Klein traveled to Colombia in 1985, where he set up a security
company called Hod Hahanit, or Glory of the Spear.
   The television said a spokesman for Hod Hahanit would not say if
it was Klein who appeared in the broadcast or if he was involved in
training paramilitary forces in Colombia.
   It said Hod Hahanit employs several high-ranking Israeli
officers, including three other reserve colonels.
   The television identified them as Tzadaka, a former paratroop
commander; Brine, a helicopter expert formerly with the air force;
and a third reserve colonel, not named, who had commanded a tank
brigade.
   One Israeli source, insisting on anonymity, said the United
States had asked Israel to look into the role of its citizens.
   The Foreign Ministry said any involvement by Israelis would
involve ``individuals who are acting on their own ... in violation
of Israeli law and contrary to Israeli policy, which is strongly
committed to the war on drugs.''
   Cmdr. Yehoshua Caspi, investigations chief for the National
Police, requested that Colombia provide Israel with any information
on drug-related activities of Israeli citizens.
   Rubinstein said Israel could block such mercenaries through a law
that forbids ex-soldiers from using their military training abroad
without Defense Ministry approval.
   Benny Tal, head of a security company with clients overseas, said
Israelis with military skills often are lured by the lucrative pay
of mercenary work.

<HEAD>Sponsors End Treasure Hunt, Give Prize to Charity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A small golden statue of a horse that remained
buried for five years despite the efforts of puzzle-solvers around
the world has been unearthed after a deadline passed and the
$500,000 prize reverted to charity.
   The site where the treasure was buried remains a secret, much to
the dismay of those who spent time and money trying to solve clues
in ``Treasure: In Search of Golden Horse,'' a yarn released in 1984
as a book, videotape and laser disc.
   Because nobody found the treasure by a May 26 deadline, under
rules of the contest the right to an annuity worth $25,000 a year
for 20 years passed to a charitable organization, Big Brothers and
Big Sisters of America.
   An employee returned to the charity's Philadelphia headquarters
on Wednesday with the horse, which carried the key to a safe-deposit
box containing rights to the $500,000.
   ``It's a handsome little statue, about eight inches from nose to
tail,'' the retriever said. The gold alone is worth nearly $12,000.
   The retriever said he insisted on anonymity because he didn't
want to be badgered by people who want him to reveal the secret. To
get the money, Big Brothers had to pledge to keep mum.
   ``It was just the way the contest promised _ at an open, public
place accessible for anyone to dig 24 hours a day,'' said the
retriever.
   The sponsors said only three people knew where the horse was
buried _ the tale's two authors and Thomas Conlon, president of the
D.L. Blair sales promotion company, which oversaw the contest.
Conlon announced in June that the solution would never be revealed.
   Big Brothers and Sisters employees began hearing from angry
solution-seekers right after the organization was designated to get
the money, but long before it learned where the treasure was.
   The employee said he came up from Philadelphia to meet Conlon in
New York on Monday and together they flew by commercial airplane.
The next day they bought a pick and shovel, rented a car and drove
to the secret treasure site.
   They were met there by author Sheldon Renan and in less than half
an hour unearthed the golden horse from a box in 2 feet of soft,
rocky soil.
   The hole also had a bottle of champagne left by Renan when he
buried the treasure in 1984.
   ``We each had a sip and emptied the remainder on the spot when we
filled in the hole,'' said the retriever.
   In addition to collecting the $500,000, the charity also will
sell the golden horse, which contains a kilogram of pure gold and
cost about $25,000 to fabricate, said David Davison, assistant
executive director of the youth service organization.

   The Socialist government has ordered $90 million in
aid for farmers hit by severe drought in western and southern France.
   Farm advocates said the aid was much too small.
   ``It's a beginning,'' Agriculture Minister Henri Nallet said on
French television after announcing the aid package.
   Nallet said it was too soon to estimate how much of this year's
harvest will be lost.
   The National Federation of Farmers' Unions said 300,000 farmers
from Cherbourg to Nice have been hurt by the drought.
   The aid program includes low-interest and zero-interest loans, a
fund for heavily indebted farmers, and a request to the European
Economic Community to let farmers who lost their crops buy European
surpluses at reduced cost.

<HEAD>Money Magazine Ranks Seattle Top Place to Live Among 300 Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RORY MARSHALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Seattle residents wish Money magazine had
focused more on the city's clouds or its losing baseball team when
it ranked U.S. cities and decided Seattle is best.
   ``Did they do that to us?'' moaned Emmett Watson, a Seattle Times
columnist and self-appointed leader of Lesser Seattle, a humorous
anti-booster entity that delights in bashing newcomers, particularly
Californians. ``I wouldn't (dispute) that Seattle is better than
Detroit and Cleveland and other such places.
   ``But it frightens me and appalls me that everybody thinks
they're coming to paradise.
   ``After you come here you still have the problems of paying off
your credit cards and moping about the schools and getting stuck in
traffic jams. ...''
   In its September issue, Money ranked Danbury, Conn. _ which the
magazine tabbed as the best place to live last year _ No. 2 and San
Francisco No. 3 in a ranking of 300 U.S. cities.
   And if being right on the Money isn't enough, Seattle was chosen
by Savvy magazine in its September issue as the nation's second-best
place to raise children, behind Minneapolis-St. Paul.
   For several years the Northwest's largest city has consistently
placed high in surveys about quality of life, where to locate new
businesses and tourist destinations.
   Tom Hobson, Seattle Chamber of Commerce spokesman, said the new
survey is just one more piece of evidence that Seattle really is a
nice place to live.
   ``There are a lot of people who would say they (surveys) don't
mean anything, each one individually,'' he said. ``But I think in
the conglomerate, Seattle always finds itself in the top 10. I am
not surprised by it anymore. I think this is a great place to live.''
   Last year, Seattle placed 11th. In Money's first survey two years
ago, the winner was Nashua, N.H., which this year was ranked fifth.
   Boosters say Seattle is attractive in part because of its robust
economy. The Boeing Co., the area's largest employer, is busy
filling record numbers of airplane orders, tourism is strong, and
the docks of Puget Sound hum with international trade activity. Last
year, Washington state bucked national deficits by posting a $7.4
billion trade surplus.
   Money's survey was conducted by asking a sample of its
subscribers to rank 10 attributes in order of what was most
important to them in a place to live. The sample's median age was 41
and household income was $42,500.
   The most important attribute this year was availability of
hospitals and doctors, followed by the likelihood of house
appreciation and affordability of housing, Money said.
   A low crime rate, the top concern the past two years, fell to No.
4 in the latest survey, followed by public transportation, public
schools and colleges, weather, leisure opportunities and the arts,
including libraries.
   Using those priorities, the rankings then were made on the basis
of an array of government and private data.
   Other cities in the Money top 10 were No. 4 Denver; 6, Boston; 7,
Boston's North Shore; 8, Central New Jersey; 9, Minneapolis-St.
Paul; and 10, Pittsburgh.
   The least desirable of the 300, according to Money, was Benton
Harbor, Mich.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Against Yen, Shares Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose Thursday against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo while share prices lost ground in quiet trading.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 221.07 points Wednesday, dropped another
106.73 points, or 0.3 percent, closing the day at 34,786.55.
   The dollar finished trading at 143.60 yen, up 1.25 yen from
Wednesday's close of 142.35 yen. After opening higher at 143.45 yen,
the U.S. currency ranged between 143.37 and 143.83 yen.
   Traders said the dollar gained ground due to news reports that a
key official in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu would
resign over a sex scandal.
   In a nationally televised news conference late Thursday morning,
Chief Cabinet Secretary Tokuo Yamashita apologized, saying ``that
such news would be reported was due completely to my own
indiscretion.''
   Yamashita, 69, who is the government's main spokesman, said he
was ``seriously considering'' whether to resign or stay in office.
   Yamashita's remarks were prompted by an article in the respected
weekly Shukan Shincho magazine alleging that, starting in 1984, he
had an affair with a 26-year-old office worker he met at a Tokyo bar
where she worked part time. It said the affair ended in 1987.
   On the stock market, securities dealers said traders were
discouraged by a decline in the value of the yen against the dollar.
   ``Also contributing to the drop in the index were reports of the
Yamashita (affair),'' said Masahiro Umemori, an equity researcher at
Nomura Securities Co.

<HEAD>Newton Described as Lonely, Prepared for Violent Death</HEAD>

   Slain Black Panther Party co-founder Huey
P. Newton, whose cry of ``Power to the people!'' electrified the
civil rights movement, struggled with the legend that surrounded
him, according to family and friends.
   As police continued searching for clues to his pre-dawn slaying a
day earlier, loved ones and associates Wednesday offered their
insights into the man whose radical views, including the use of
violence, heightened black militancy.
   The Black Panthers were the ultimate symbol of that social
movement. But in the view of many in law enforcement, the Panthers
were as described in the 1960s by the FBI: ``hoodlum-type
revolutionaries,'' stockpiling weapons, espousing Marxist-Leninist
doctrines and terrorizing black communities.
   Black leaders and other admirers of Newton's chafed at portrayals
of him as a gangster and said such statements could stir racial
tensions and lead to a violent backlash.
   ``A lot of black people are very angered by the fact that Huey
Newton is getting put in the box of being a gangster,'' said the
Rev. Cecil Williams of the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in
San Francisco. ``That only incites people and could lead to acts of
violence.''
   No suspects have been identified in Newton's killing and no
motive offered by police, although authorities speculated the
slaying could have been drug- or gang-related, or an act of random
violence or an aborted robbery.
   ``We're making some progress but nothing significant,'' said
Oakland police Lt. Mike Sims.
   About 50 mourners, some of whom said Newton's philosophy helped
blacks battle racism, gathered Wednesday for a second night in the
drug-infested neighborhood of rundown Victorian-style houses where
Newton, 47, was gunned down.
   Those who knew him well met with reporters at his brother's home.
   ``He was certainly a lonely man in that we didn't have any more
fights, any more struggles,'' said former Panther leader David
Hilliard. ``We talked a lot about loneliness and our desire to
recreate the energy of the 60s.
   ``He regretted that he was not more successful at eradicating
sexism, racism and classism.''
   Newton's latest plans were to make a film about environmental
problems, which he believed were linked to the oppression of
minorities, said his brother, Melvin.
   Newton's wife of almost five years, Fredrika, 37, said her
husband had been feeling well and spending a lot of time at her home
in Berkeley while recuperating from two recent abdominal operations.
   She denied reports that Newton had a drug problem or a
girlfriend, saying he was a devoted husband and father to her son
from a previous marriage.
   Newton was incarcerated for 90 days earlier this year for
possession of drug paraphernalia.
   But Newton's older brother would not comment on reports of
Newton's drug problems, instead portraying the slain leader as a man
who devoted himself years ago to the struggle for social justice.
   ``He had no particular concerns about his own life,'' said Melvin
Newton. ``He felt that once he decided to be a revolutionary, he was
in a position of suicide anyway.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules School Can Use Confederate Symbols</HEAD>

   Students at a suburban high school can continue to
use Confederate symbols for their sports teams after a federal judge
ruled that the symbols may be distressing but are nonetheless legal.
   ``I have to apply the law even if I disagree with it,'' U.S.
District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer told officials of the NAACP and the
Garland Independent School District on Wednesday.
   South Garland High School has a flag that resembles a Confederate
flag except for a drawing in the middle, said Ed Cloutman, attorney
for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
The school's fight song is sung to the tune of ``Dixie'' and a
school mascot dresses like a Confederate army officer.
   The NAACP asked Buchmeyer to forbid the district from using them,
calling the symbols disruptive and racist.
   ``There's no question in the court's mind of the effect these
symbols have had on those who object to them. ... But the symbols
have not resulted in violence or disruption and have not been used
to prohibit blacks from taking part in extracurricular activities,''
Buchmeyer said.
   NAACP Southwest Regional Director Rev. Richard Dockery said he
respected the judge's ruling.
   ``We have no problem with the judge's ruling as it relates to his
imposing and enforcing the law, upholding the law, as he stated the
law,'' Dockery said. ``Even though he ruled against us, I respect
his decision.''
   Dockery said there are no immediate plans to appeal or to ask the
school district to voluntarily change the symbols. School
Superintendent Jill Shugart indicated that the district would not
likely eliminate them.
   ``It was the school board and the administration's position that
those symbols had been selected years ago by the students ... and we
had had no evidence of student disruption or problems,'' Ms. Shugart
said.
   The administration asked the student leadership to review the
question last year. After a series of meetings, the students
recommended that the symbols remain. Ms. Shugart said she would be
reluctant to intervene in that decision.
   South Garland High School has 2,350 students, about 80 percent of
them white, Ms. Shugart said. Cloutman said he believed about 10
percent of the students are black.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen assassinated a senior aide of
Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal in an ambush on the northern
outskirts of south Lebanon's provincial capital, riddling him with
15 bullets, police reported.
   He was identified by his nom de guerre of Rabah Abdul-Rahim.
Police said they do not know his real name or his age, but said he
was a senior member of Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council
faction.
   Abdul-Rahim was driving with his bodyguards late Wednesday into
Sidon from Beirut, 25 miles to the north, when gunmen in a black
sedan raked his car with machine gun fire, police said.
   One of his bodyguards, Hisham Saeed, 28, was seriously wounded,
the spokesman added.
   No group claimed responsibility for the assassination.
   Abu Nidal has long been at odds with Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman Yasser Arafat, who has re-established a major
power base in the refugee camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh in
Sidon.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, is high on U.S. and
western European wanted lists for scores of terrorist attacks,
including the December 1985 attacks on Rome and Vienna airports.

<HEAD>Study Shows Teens Use Condoms for Wrong Reasons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Today's teen-agers may become tomorrow's AIDS
victims unless they learn the rules of safe sex, say researchers who
found that teens primarily use condoms for reasons other than
preventing disease.
   In a study of 506 youths, researchers at the University of
California's San Francisco campus found that teen-agers largely use
condoms to allow easy and spontaneous sex.
   ``Among male adolescents as was found with female adolescents the
intention to use condoms in the next year was not associated with
believing that condoms prevent STDs (sexually transmitted diseases)
or that condoms are effective in preventing pregnancy,'' the authors
wrote.
   The researchers said the results show that although sexually
transmitted diseases other than AIDS are rampant among teens, most
youths think they are immune.
   The findings come amidst a push by health professionals to curb
the disease rate as well as teen pregnancies by encouraging condom
use, and indicate the approach should be geared more toward concerns
expressed by youths in the study, Susan Kegeles, the leading
researcher, said Wednesday.
   She said health professionals are concerned that the same type of
sexual behavior that leads to diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis _
frequent sex with multiple partners _ is putting teens at risk for
developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``We know right now that 20 percent of people who have AIDS are
in their twenties,'' and since the disease usually isn't diagnosed
until years after exposure, ``most of those people in their twenties
probably contracted it when they were teen-agers,'' said Ms.
Kegeles, a research psychologist at the Center for AIDS Prevention
Studies at the San Francisco campus.
   Health factors such as AIDS prevention are the most emphasized
issue in trying to get teens to use condoms, Ms. Kegeles said.
   ``But what we found was that although they knew that condoms
prevent disease, that wasn't connected with their intent to use
them,'' she said.
   The study, published in the August issue of the Chicago-based
American Journal of Diseases of Children, is based on surveys of
youths who attended two health clinics in the San Francisco area
from February 1984 to September 1985.
   The mean age was about 16 for girls and boys. Thirty-two percent
of the girls and 43 percent of the boys were virgins. Of those who
were sexually active, 59 percent of the girls and 63 percent of the
boys had used condoms.
   Teens were asked if they were going to have sex in the next year,
and what factors would be involved in their decision to use condoms.
   Though other forms of birth control were not addressed in the
condom survey, the factors cited by teens would relate to a choice
of condoms over three other forms of contraception _ the diaphragm,
birth-control pills or withdrawal.
   Ease of use, enabling one to have sex ``on the spur of the
moment'' and popularity with peers were among factors listed by both
sexes.
   The latest statistics from the national Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta show that among teens ages 15 to 19, 195,312
cases of gonorrhea were reported in 1988, or 1,075.3 cases per
100,000.

<HEAD>Scientists Believe to Have Found the Gene for Cystic Fibrosis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of scientists from the United States and
Canada believe they have discovered the fatal gene defect that
causes cystic fibrosis.
   The team of molecular biologists scheduled news conferences today
in Toronto and Washington to report on the discovery, details of
which are to be published in the scientific journal Science next
month.
   ``This is one of the most significant discoveries in the history
of human genetics,'' Dr. Ronald Worton, chief geneticist at
Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children's said Wednesday.
   The discovery is a crucial step toward developing either a new
treatment or a cure for the inherited disease _ the most common
genetic defect in whites. About half of those who suffer from the
disease don't live to adulthood.
   Scientists say about 12 million Americans _ about five percent _
carry the gene for the disease, but a child must inherit it from
both parents to be affected. About 30,000 people in the United
States have cystic fibrosis, today's New York Times said.
   Cystic fibrosis, a disorder of the breathing system, pancreas and
sweat glands, is so debilitating that few who have it live past
their 20s.
   ``Parents should be absolutely optimistic and excited about
this,'' Dr. Robert Beall, executive vice president for medical
affairs at the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in Bethesda, Md., told The
Times.
   ``We have been in a bottleneck and now we have magnificent
opportunities before us,'' said Beall.
   The disease affects secretory cells, causing the lungs, pancreas
and skin to produce too much mucous and retain an excess of sodium
ions.
   Treatment includes a variety of medications and more recently,
double lung transplants, although eventually a new lung will become
irreparably damaged also.
   Lap-Chee Tsui at Sick Children's heads the team with the
collaboration of Francis Collins of the University of Michigan at
Ann Arbor. He stresses that finding the defective gene isn't a cure.
   ``First we need to have the actual gene,'' Tsui said. ``Then we
have to find out what the gene does, or does not do, that causes the
disease.''
   Genes are units of DNA, the molecule of heredity. Before the
chemical structure of a gene is identified, it must be located on
one of the 46 chromosomes found in every human cell.
   ``It's like hunting for a needle in a haystack,'' Tsui said.
   Scientists say they will now focus on how the gene functions and
how the defect can be rectified.

   Venezuela increased its forces on the
border to keep out drug dealers who may try to escape a crackdown in
neighboring Colombia, President Carlos Andres Perez said.
   In Bolivia, authorities said Wednesday that border patrols also
were reinforced and police helicopters were on alert for Colombian
traffickers.
   Perez also proposed that nations of the Western Hemisphere hold a
summit to come up with strategies to combat drug trafficking.
   ``Narcotics trafficking has to be fought as the most abominable
crime of the century,'' the Venezuelan leader said late Tuesday in a
speech at the anniversary celebration of a cooperative educational
institute.
   Perez said it also would have to be considered a crime ``without
frontiers'' to combat effectively.
   Venezuelan press accounts have warned of the possibility of drug
smugglers entering Venezuela to escape the recent crackdown in
Colombia.
   Perez said Venezuela had tightened patrols along its 1,000-mile
border with Colombia, traditionally an area plagued by smuggling and
guerrilla activity.
   Venezuela does not have a history of drug trafficking, although
it is being increasingly used as a transfer point for cocaine and
other drugs being smuggled to Europe and the United States,
according to police.
   In Bolivia, however, there are dozens of cocaine processing labs
in the northern Beni jungle region, and officials increased patrols
along Bolivia's border with Brazil.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has said that the raw
material for at least one-third of the cocaine that reaches U.S. and
European markets is produced in Bolivia.
   ``The violence and corruption that exists in Colombia could be
transferred to Bolivia, especially because of the offensive by the
Colombian government,'' said Bolivia Sen. Daniel Cabezas, head of
the Senate committee on drugs.
   In June, two Colombian drug traffickers were captured when police
raided the town of Santa Ana de Yacuma, home to some of Bolivia's
top cocaine traffickers. There have been several killings in Santa

<HEAD>U.S.-Soviet Conference on Global Warming Opens At Redford Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SUNDANCE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a toast to ``greenhouse glasnost,''
Robert Redford opened a U.S.-Soviet conference on global warming
that organizers hope will help bind the two countries in
environmental action.
   ``Our nations have competed for so long and so destructively, the
waste of resources has been a very real and human tragedy,'' the
actor-filmmaker told 200 people who gathered Wednesday night at his
Sundance resort in central Utah's Wasatch mountains. ``I drink to
peace and I drink to healing our planet.''
   Eleven Soviets and more than 80 U.S. participants are attending
the four-day symposium, co-sponsored by the Soviet Academy of
Sciences and the Institute for Resource Management, a non-profit
group Redford founded in 1981.
   ``What we're attempting to do ... is to get not just scientists
talking to scientists, or governments talking to governments,'' said
Terry Minger, the institute's president. ``Scientists will lay out
the problem, but we also have businessmen, filmmakers, authors,
artists and environmentalists.''
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., praised the U.S.-Soviet cooperation.
``All of us see the land's vulnerability to abuse,'' he said, ``and
we recognize that its potential for giving us rebirth may be
slipping away.''
   Also expected to participate were astronomer Carl Sagan,
biologist Paul Ehrlich, former Interior Secretary Stewart Udall,
Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, and Sens. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., and John
Heinz, R-Pa.
   Last summer's drought and heat wave helped thrust global warming
into the public eye.
   Scientists disagree on whether the hot spell was a natural
variation or the start of the greenhouse effect, an atmospheric
warming caused by industrial and auto pollution that trap solar heat.
   But most researchers agree that the greenhouse effect has the
potential for melting the polar ice caps, raising sea levels and
changing weather patterns worldwide.
   ``We're taking the premise that in fact global climate change is
taking place,'' Minger said. ``As two leading nations, what do we do
about it?''
   The United States and Soviet Union produce about half the gases,
mostly carbon dioxide, believed responsible for global warming, he
said.
   ``This `greenhouse glasnost' is something we've been working on
jointly for a year and a half,'' Minger said. ``This is a very
important issue to them.''
   Minger hopes the conference will urge action on global warming by
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Other plans include setting up joint projects to monitor forest
growth in the two countries, joint educational programs, and a joint
filmmaking venture.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Scattered Across U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong thunderstorms were scattered across much of the country,
dumping more than 4 inches of rain in Mississippi, triggering flash
floods in Kentucky and spawning tornadoes in Montana.
   Blustery winds accompanied a cold front in the West. A family of
four drowned after winds gusting to more than 35 mph capsized their
sailboat on Lake Tahoe on Wednesday afternoon.
   The bodies were found floating in the lake, which turned choppy
when the fast-moving front hit and dropped temperatures to about 60
degrees. Douglas County Sheriff's Sgt. Larry Coy said the victims,
who wore life jackets, may have suffered hypothermia because of the
high winds and chilly water.
   Wind gusts up to 55 mph were recorded in northwest Utah.
   In the north-central states, thunderstorms spawned one tornado
near Sidney and others near Crane in eastern Montana Wednesday
evening. There were no reports of injuries or damage. However, storm
winds did knock down a power pole near Williston, N.D., causing a
power outage.
   Heavy thunderstorm rains caused flash floods along the Big and
Stinking creeks in southeastern Kentucky Wednesday evening. The
Stinking Creek volunteer fire department reported water more than 14
feet above normal in both creeks.
   Thunderstorms also produced locally heavy rains in south-central
Texas, where 2.81 inches fell at Laredo, and in central Mississippi,
where 4\ inches fell at Alta Woods in less than one hour.
   Showers and thunderstorms were most numerous from east-central
Kansas to west-central Illinois early today. They also were
scattered across Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia, south-central
Texas, and from eastern Nevada and western Utah to Montana, Idaho
and eastern Washington.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms also were over the
southern Atlantic Coast states.
   Heavier rainfall for the six hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT included
1.30 inches at Brunswick, Ga., 1.10 inches at Jackson, Miss., and
1.09 inches at St. Louis.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
eastern portions of the southern Plains across the lower and middle
Mississippi Valley, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys and the Gulf
Coast states to the southern Atlantic states, with the heaviest rain
in West Virginia and Kentucky. Widely scattered thunderstorms were
forecast for western portions of the southern Plains, parts of
Wyoming and eastern Montana. Rain was expected in the northern
Rockies and much of Idaho, eastern portions of Washington and
Oregon, and parts of Nevada and Utah.
   Highs were expected to be in the 70s from New England across the
northern and central Appalachians to the Great Lakes, with some 60s
in northern Maine; the 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast, over the
Pacific Northwest and across the intermountain region to the
northern Rockies, with some 50s in western Montana; 100 to 105
degrees in parts of central and southwest Texas, and the Desert
Southwest; and the 80s and 90s elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 42 degrees at Yellowstone
Park, Wyo., to 88 degrees at Phoenix.

   Authorities say they don't know why a man dumped a
severed horse's head in front of a federal court building, but the
man accused in the act is behind bars.
   FBI agents arrested Claude L. Philibert, 46, of Felton, on
Wednesday evening after Cobb County police stopped his car in
Marietta a few hours after the dumping at the Richard B. Russell
Federal Building in downtown Atlanta.
   FBI spokesman Diader H. Rosario said Philibert was to be
arraigned this morning on charges of threatening a federal officer.
   In the Mario Puzo book and movie ``The Godfather,'' the Mafia
leaves a horse's head in a movie producer's bed as a threat.
   But Rosario said, ``We don't know why he might have done this.''
   Witnesses told authorities they saw a man drive a black Chrysler
New Yorker onto the sidewalk to the federal building's front door
and, appearing highly agitated, take a plastic bag from the car's
trunk Wednesday afternoon.
   As he approached the front door, witnesses said, the bag ripped
and he dropped it, exposing the horse's head. The witnesses also
said the man was wearing an empty gun holster on his hip.

   An earthquake jolted the island of
Zakinthos off Greece's western coast before dawn today but there
were no reports of damage or injuries, the Athens Geodynamic
Institute said.
   The quake, measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale, struck at 5.13
a.m. and was centered 31 miles west of the Ionian island in the
Aegean Sea, the Institute reported.
   Police at Zakinthos said by telephone the tremor was strong, but
that the residents did not panic.
   ``It happens all the time. We had one like it about 15 days
ago,'' said police official Christos Tatsis.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase in one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude and a quake of 5 can cause considerable damage if it
hits an urban area.

   A family of four was killed when their
small airplane hit a power line that had been strung over a highway
two days earlier.
   The pilot, Paul Humphries, 39, apparently was flying low over
I-580 near Altamont Pass to navigate his way to the Livermore
Airport beneath a thick layer of clouds. The plane clipped one of
four lines strung over the highway.
   The family from Pleasanton was returning Tuesday night from a
visit with relatives in Vancouver, British Columbia.
   Killed were Humphries, his wife, Lorraine, 37, son, Stephen, 10,
and daughter, Michelle, 6, said Tom Spigelmire, a close friend of
the family's.
   However, the Alameda County Coroner's office would not confirm
the identification of the victims late Wednesday.
   The plane careened a few hundred feet then erupted into a
fireball and ignited the hillside, witnesses said. The plane, a
four-seat single engine Mooney, was owned by the family, authorities
said.
   The steel cables that some authorities said were to blame for the
crash were strung on Sunday but weren't transmitting power at the
time, said Jim Feider, deputy manager for the Western Area Power
Administration office in Sacramento.

<HEAD>Top Cabinet Official Considering Resigning over Affair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's new government suffered its first setback
today when a top Cabinet official said he was considering resigning
following disclosures that he had an extra-marital affair.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Tokuo Yamashita, 69, apologized for the
``indiscretion.''
   It was the second sex scandal this summer involving a member of
the governing Liberal Democratic Party and the first crisis for the
government created two weeks ago by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   Kaifu, speaking to reporters as he headed to a special meeting
with party leaders, said the question of resigning ``should be
decided by the politician himself.'' He did not comment further.
   One party faction, led by former Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, said a Cabinet member should ``take responsibility'' _
meaning resign _ if he has damaged the government's reputation, said
a faction official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Kaifu met for two hours with party Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa
and members of the party political reform committee. They left
without speaking to reporters.
   The tense atmosphere followed the disclosure that Yamashita, the
Cabinet's spokesman and coordinator, had an affair with a woman
almost 45 years younger than himself. He and his wife of more than
40 years, Kyoko, have four grown daughters.
   Yamashita said at a nationally televised morning news conference
that he was ``seriously considering'' whether to resign following
disclosures that he had an affair.
   ``That such news would be reported was due completely to my own
indiscretion,'' said Yamashita, Kaifu's top aide.
   ``The task of the Kaifu Cabinet is to promote clean government
and as I must follow that and support the prime minister ... I can
offer only my deepest apologies to the people of Japan,'' he said.
   Yamashita told reporters after the party leaders met that he was
still ``analyzing opinions and trying to make up my mind'' whether
to resign.
   ``One way or the other, the decision has to come before long,''
he said.
   Asked if the situation had any impact on Kaifu's trip to the
United States, Canada and Mexico next week, Yamashita merely said he
was considering whether it had any impact.
   ``The public is not going to tolerate such insensitivity of
political leaders,'' said Yotaro Konaka, a prominent author and
critic on social issues. ``People must doubt if the new government,
which appointed such a person to its top post just when political
ethics has become a national issue, has any common sense at all.''
   If Yamashita resigns, Konaka said other top politicians would be
under similar pressure.
   Masaya Ito, a prominent political analyst, said the scandal is
unlikely to cause fatal damage to the Kaifu administration because
it does not directly involve the prime minister.
   ``But it is particularly damaging for Kaifu in a sense that the
public is not going to believe what he says from now on after such a
disgusting scandal,'' he said.
   Japanese society has long been tolerant of rich and powerful men
having affairs and mistresses, and such matters seldom were reported
in national media. But the taboo was broken in June when a respected
weekly magazine published an interview with an ex-geisha who said
then-Prime Minister Sousuke Uno had paid her to be his mistress.
   Uno had been in office less than a week, and uproar over the
allegation contributed to his downfall and to the low popularity of
the Liberal Democrats, who are reeling from a bribery scandal and
from public dislike of a new 3 prcent sales tax.
   Uno resigned and was succeeded by Kaifu after the Liberal
Democrats suffered a massive defeat in the July 23 election and lost
their majority in the upper house of parliament.
   In Yamashita's case, the respected weekly Shukan Shincho reported
in its issue released today that he started an affair with an office
worker and part-time bar hostess in 1984 when she was 21. The
magazine said the affair lasted for more than three years, during
which time he served as transport minister and head of the
Management and Coordination Agency.
   It reported that he gave her $21,000 on Aug. 3, when there was
speculation he would get a high post in the new government. The
woman, who was not identified, has returned the money, according to
the magazine.
   Yamashita, a seven-term lawmaker who had a reputation as a clean
politician, denied the money was intended to keep her from talking
about the affair.
   ``I did it from my own good intentions after hearing that she's
still having problems in her life,'' he was quoted as saying.

<HEAD>County Posting Stickers By Sewers to Warn Against Bay Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince George's County is posting
stickers next to all 32,000 county gutters reminding residents that
what goes into the sewers eventually winds up in the Chesapeake Bay.
   ``Do Not Litter - Chesapeake Bay Drainage,'' read the stickers
which officials hope to complete distributing in the next two years.
   ``Storm drains are for rain only and not for oil and not for
grass clippings and not for Styrofoam,'' said County Executive
Parris N. Glendening.
   ``Some home mechanics and home gardeners dump their oil waste and
yard waste in storm drains on Saturday,'' Glendening said Wednesday.
``On Sunday, they go to the bay and bemoan the oil slicks and other
pollutants. Some people think it goes to sewage treatment plants,
but not so.''
   Prince George's County is the first in the state to place
warnings on storm gutters, although other counties encourage
community groups to do so.
   County environmental officials estimate that about half of the
organic pollutants in the bay, nitrogen and phosphorus, come from
storm water runoff collected by storm gutters. The two elements,
when present in extreme quantities, deoxygenate water and disrupt
the bay's ecological balance.

   Independent states until a Soviet-Nazi treaty
signed 50 years ago deeded them to the Kremlin's sphere of
influence, the three restive Baltic republics of western Soviet
Union have been raising a growing clamor for control over their
internal affairs.
   Here are some facts and figures on these republics:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ESTONIA _ Located across the Gulf of Finland from Finland and
bounded on the east by the Russian republic, Estonia has an area of
18,040 square miles and a population of 1.6 million. Two-thirds of
its inhabitants are ethnic Estonians, who speak a language related
to Finnish. Russians make up 28 percent of the population. Capital:
Tallinn.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LATVIA _ Sandwiched between its two Baltic neighbors and bordered
on the east by Russia and Byelorussia, Latvia dramatically shows the
influence of the Russian influx feared by Baltic militants. Results
for the 1989 national census are not yet available, but Latvians
already are a minority in their homeland of 25,480 square miles, and
may number only 40 percent of the republic's 2.7 million residents.
Capital: Riga.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LITHUANIA _ The largest and most populous of the Baltic republics
with 26,080 square miles and 3.7 million inhabitants, Lithuania is
bounded by Latvia, Byelorussia and Russia and has a short frontier
with Poland. Lithuanians total some 80 percent of the population,
making this the Baltic state with the highest percentage of its
titular nationality. Capital: Vilnius.

<TEXT>
   East Germany has openly acknowledged for the first
time the existence of secret protocols in the 1939 non-aggression
pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
   The Communist East German leadership strongly defended the pact,
saying the treaty gave Moscow time to prepare for war.
   Communist Party historian Heinz Kuehnrich said in a newspaper
interview Wednesday that the pact, which contained protocols that
put the then-independent Baltic republics into the Soviet orbit, was
essential to Moscow's defense strategy.
   ``The Soviet Union gained territory for its defense (against Nazi
aggression),'' Kuehnrich told the Junge Welt newspaper, a party
organ for young people.
   On Aug. 23, 1939, Hitler and Stalin divided Eastern Europe into
spheres of influence. Within days, Nazi Germany invaded Poland. The
Soviet Union later occupied eastern Poland.
   Less than a year later, Stalin took over the Baltic states of
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. That action is now an explosive issue
in the Soviet Baltic region, with the 50-year anniversary sparking
increased demands for independence.
   Western accounts say the pact paved the way for the beginning of
World War II.
   Kuehnrich called the interpretation ``nonsense, that stands the
facts on their heads.''
   He denied the pact set the stage for war.
   ``The timing of the pact and the beginning of war has been used
to trick people into believing that the Soviet Union was partly
responsible for the war,'' the historian said.
   ``Hitler wanted war, not the Soviet Union,'' Kuehnrich said.

   The dollar was higher in quiet European trading
this morning, but down from its earlier levels.
   Gold prices fell.
   The dollar jumped in Asian trading and opened strongly in the
European business day. But then it fell back a bit on profit-taking.
   The foreign exchange market was being dominated by chart-related
movements, with most technical analysts calling for the dollar to
rise in the near-term, traders said.
   ``After 1.9400 (West German marks) held, the dollar was bound to
rebounce,'' one Rome trader said. He added, however, that the dollar
was likely to encounter profit-taking intermittently.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5660 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5700 late Wednesday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.9603 West German marks, up from 1.9555
   _1.6893 Swiss francs, up from 1.6870
   _6.6135 French francs, up from 6.5965
   _2.2133 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2000
   _1,406.50 Italian lire, up from 1,399.50
   _1.1760 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1727
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.25 yen to a closing 143.60 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 143.35 yen.
   Gold opened in London at $363.30 a troy ounce, compared with late
Wednesday's $364.25. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $363.60.
   In Zurich, the bid was $363.75 compared with $363.85 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.48 to close at $364.75.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.17 a troy ounce, down from
Wednesday's $5.19.

<TEXT>
   Government employees who graduated from college in
1985 or later have been ordered to work one to two years in
``grassroots units'' to improve their political understanding,
officials said today.
   The move is part of new government efforts since the crushed
spring pro-democracy protests to make youth both ``red,'' or
politically sound, and expert in ominous echoes of the far leftist
Cultural Revolution.
   The Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, said that
youths still in school who create disturbances rather than study
will be expelled and could face criminal prosecution.
   The newspaper directed a lengthy editorial at college students,
many of whom are resuming class this month. ``Students from today
must conscientiously study Marxist-Leninist-Mao Tse-tung thought
(and) study the party's line,'' it said.
   The new order affecting graduates for the past four years
reflects deep government suspicion over the political reliability of
an entire generation of educated youth. Many young government
workers marched in the student-led protests for a freer society that
ended with a bloody army attack on June 3-4.
   Earlier this month, education officials denied reports that all
recent graduates were being sent out of the capital.
   However, this week's Culture News, the Culture Ministry's
newspaper, said college graduates assigned to work in the ministry
first must join in unspecified ``group study'' and then spend one to
two years receiving ``training'' in an enterprise under the
ministry's jurisdiction.
   It said the graduates' residence permits will be switched from
Beijing to their new location, and that those who do not perform
well will not be allowed to return to the ministry. China tries to
limit the population of its cities, and Beijing residence permits
are especially difficult to obtain.
   ``Every office (of the ministry) ... must help these comrades to
raise their political and professional quality,'' the paper said.
   The Culture Ministry, contacted by telephone, confirmed the
report but said it did not know how many employees were affected,
when they would leave for their new jobs or exactly where they would
go.
   The Ministry of Broadcast, Film and Television and Academy of
Social Sciences also confirmed such an order was issued but said
they had not begun sending their recent graduates to new jobs. The
Defense Ministry and State Education Commission said they were not
accepting any new graduates this year.
   Students who had planned to start graduate studies this September
also must undergo what is called ``grassroots training,'' the
government announced recently. This usually means working in a
county town.
   Some observers have likened it to the 1966-76 far leftist
Cultural Revolution, when virtually all of China's college and
middle school students were sent to work on farm communes. Many were
never able to regain their city residence permits.
   Now, however, the communes no longer exist, and there is no
indication the youth will be put to work planting rice or feeding
pigs.
   Education officials said a 1983 regulation called for all college
graduates to spend a year at the grassroots before joining central
government offices, but it never was enforced.
   Students said usually only the most politically active youths
chose to work at the grassroots in hopes of gaining party membership.
   Most Beijing college students return to class this month and face
several weeks of concentrated political study. The People's Daily
editorial acknowledged continued campus unrest. ``The minds of the
students are far from calm,'' it said. It said the political study
should help them ``begin the school year with their minds at rest.''
   It reiterated government pledges to punish only the ringleaders
of the seven-week democracy movement.
   Hundreds of students, professors and other intellectuals have
been arrested since June 3-4, along with thousands of workers. The
president of Beijing University, whose students led the protests,
was replaced Wednesday.
   The government has stopped announcing most arrests, but the
official radio in the southeastern province of Guangdong reported
today that five people were arrested there for plotting to smuggle a
wanted student leader from the country.
   It said the five had entered China from Hong Kong but did not
make clear if they were Hong Kong residents. It said three of the
five were students and were released, while two remained in custody.
The wanted student, Zheng Xuguang, was arrested in July, police said
weeks ago.

   Visits to gay bars and interviews with
prostitutes have been dropped from a community college's sexuality
course after the county Board of Supervisors balked at approving the
school's budget.
   Officials at Nassau Community College agreed Wednesday to drop
the material, said Ed Ward, executive assistant to Hempstead's
presiding town supervisor.
   Ward also said the class will no longer have such homework
assignments as taking a bubble bath and masturbating and that it
will not see 80 slides of male and female genitalia, although an
explicit film on sexual intercourse will be allowed.
   Bob Allen, a college spokesman, said the faculty already had
initiated the changes and that the slides hadn't been used in more
than a year. He called the controversy a ``communications failure.''
   The board was expected to pass the budget in a special meeting
today, after a refusal Monday threatened to delay the beginning of
the fall semester September 5.

him slippery enough to pull out.
   Bobby Pitterman was taken to a hospital with minor injuries after

   ``We got him to relax and as soon as we got him to relax enough

   R.D. Laing, the British psychiatrist who became a
counterculture hero of the 1960s with his controversial attacks on
the nuclear family, died while vacationing in France, his son said
today. He was 61.
   The Scottish-born psychiatrist collapsed on a tennis court
Wednesday in the southern city of St. Tropez, said his son Adrian.
He said he did not know the cause of death. ``It's a shock,'' he
said in an interview.
   An unorthodox pioneer in the treatment of schizophrenics, Ronald
David Laing jarred traditional psychiatry with his first book, ``The
Divided Self: An Existential Study in Sanity and Madness,''
published in 1960.
   He rejected notions that schizophrenia is a genetic or biological
aberration, believing instead in the family's role in creating the
disease, although he later became more open to physiological
theories, said his son.
   Laing's views on the strains the nuclear family could put on an
individual's sanity fell in with the rebellious spirit of the 1960s
counterculture, which made him one of its gurus.
   Contending that most psychiatry added to patient misery, he
refused to treat them with drugs or electric shocks unless they
asked for them.
   ``Sanity, Madness and the Family,'' written with A.A. Esterson
and published in 1964, presented case histories based on his
approach to families.
   At Kingsley Hall, the London residential treatment hostel he
helped to run, he experimented with the therapeutic use of mescaline
and LSD. He was a prominent campaigner for the legalization of
marijuana.
   He is survived by his common-law wife, Margarita, an infant son
by her; his first wife, Anne, and their daughters Caron and Fiona;
and sons Paul and Adrian, said Adrian Laing.
   His survivors also include two sons from a second marriage, Adam
and Max, and a daughter Natasha, as well as a child Benjamin by
another common-law wife, said Adrian.

   Eugene Frank Robel, a labor activist who won a
U.S. Supreme Court ruling against a law that banned communists from
working in defense plants, was struck by a train and killed Sunday.
He was 78.
   Robel, a retired Todd Shipyard machinist, was a lifelong member
of the American Communist Party.
   During the 1950s, he was once called to testify before the House
Committee on Un-American Activities. Robel and six others were
expelled from Local 79 of the Machinists union. He was allowed to
continue to work and continued to support unions and honor picket
lines.
   In the 1960s, with help from the American Civil Liberties Union,
Robel challenged the Internal Security Act of 1950, a section of
which forbade communists from working in military plants.
   He was arrested in 1963 for holding communist beliefs while
working at the shipyard. The U.S. Supreme Court, ruling in his case,
overturned the law's provision in 1967.

   Immigration officials will change the color of
immigrant work permits, commonly known as green cards, to prevent
counterfeiters from duplicating the documents.
   The new cards, to be issued to aliens who have achieved
permanent-resident status, are rose-colored on the front and will
bear the photograph, signature and fingerprint of the worker. The
reverse side will bear pink-to-blue rainbow shading to cut down on
forgeries, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said Wednesday.
   ``The more you change the color the more confusing it is to
counterfeiters,'' explained Neil Henry, deputy Los Angeles district
director for legalization for the INS.
   Officials say the temporary work permits probably will still be
called green cards, however. The cards haven't been green since the
1960s, Henry said, but the name has stuck through several color
changes, most recently blue and off-white.
   The immigration service does not plan to replace the 10 million
cards already in circulation, Verne Jervis, an INS spokesperson in
Washington, told The New York Times. The new cards will be phased
in, issued to new aliens, workers who have lost their cards, or
permanent residents' children when they reach age 14.
   INS Western Regional Director Bill King said the cards will be
issued in conjunction with INS plans to begin accepting applications
for seasonal agricultural worker status.
   The four-year program will permit noncitizen participants to
legally enter or remain in the United States as agricultural
workers, King said. The filing period begins Sept. 1 and runs
through Nov. 30.

   Explorers in a research boat
returned today for a second glimpse of the wreck of the Edmund
Fitzgerald, after an initial look showed the ship remarkably intact
in the cold depths of Lake Superior.
   ``This is amazing, totally amazing,'' archaeologist Phil Wright,
on board as an observer for the Canadian Marine Heritage
Conservation Program in Ottawa, said Wednesday as he watched a
monitor in the dark control room of the research vessel.
   He watched the screen intently as a small submersible robot sent
up images, showing the large white ship upright in the black mud,
its name clearly visible on its side.
   The Edmund Fitzgerald had taken on more than 26 tons of
concentrated iron ore pellets at Superior, Wis., and was bound for
Cleveland when it sank in a gale Nov. 10, 1975. The 729-foot vessel
disappeared in Canadian water 17 miles off the coast of northern
Michigan. All 29 aboard died, their bodies never recovered.
Singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot recounted the tragedy in a ballad
that became a popular hit in the 70s.
   Wednesday, researchers lowered a submersible robot carrying
specialized video cameras 556 feet down to the wreck. The view was
startlingly clear.
   The first glimpse was a ghostly faint image of the ship's white
radio tower.
   As the robot dropped lower and nearer, the battered pilothouse
loomed onto the screen, showing crisp pictures of portholes burst by
tremendous pressure, electronic equipment tossed about within, and
the ship's bell with its clapper tied by a cord.
   The hull remained white, barely dusted with lake sdiment and just
beginning to rust where the force of the sinking had bent and ripped
its steel sides.
   ``It was just like tinfoil,'' said Chris Nicholson, who developed
and piloted the small video robot attached by cable to the mother
ship. Three-dimensional images from the robot will enable
researchers to map details of the Fitzgerald down to the centimeter.
   Searchers had expected to encounter bodies of some of the
Fitzgerald's American crew, but none was seen in Wednesday's initial
exploration.
   ``We are not here to disturb, we are only here to remember,''
said Clifford Wilson, captain of the research boat, Grayling, on
loan for the expedition from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Wilson held a short shipboard memorial service for the crew before
the robot was lowered.
   Tom Farnquist, director of the Lakes Shipwreck Historical
Society, said the reason for the search was to produce sharp, color
footage of the wreck to satisfy public curiosity.
   The expedition, coordinated by the society, is testing the new
video system for underwater exploration. After more looks at the
Fitzgerald today, the team hopes to document the deep remains of as
many as five other ships preserved by the depth and coldness of the
largest of the Great Lakes.
   The official U.S. Coast Guard report concludes the Fitzgerald
sank by taking on water through its hatches as the ship plowed
through a tremendous storm with waves of up to 35 feet. However,
others believe the boat punched a hole in its hull when the waves
set it down upon a shallow shoal.
   Either way, the boat went down so quickly it disappeared from
radar within minutes of its captain telling another boat that he was
holding his own in the storm.
   Because official conclusions on why the Fitzgerald sank differ,
researchers think the expedition will shed new light on the disaster.

<TEXT>
   Activists in the Baltics should abandon
their ``secessionist mood'' and negotiate with Soviet officials on
achieving more independence, the Communist Party daily Pravda said
today.
   On Wednesday, hundreds of thousands of people formed a giant
human chain across the Baltics to dramatize their demand for
independence.
   Pravda told the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
that there is an alternative to secession.
   The article said the party's reforms already allow more
independence to republics within the framework of the Soviet Union,
and it called for the ``scrupulous and friendly labor'' needed to
implement them.
   Hundreds of thousands of people stood hand-in-hand across the
Baltic republics Wednesday to mark the 50th anniversary of a secret
agreement between Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin that put the
then-independent republics into the Soviet orbit.
   The protest, organized by grassroots groups in the three
republics, reflected activists' growing calls for full independence
from Moscow instead of merely increased sovereignty.
   Official estimates provided by the Tass news agency in Moscow
said 500,000 people turned out in Lithuania, a republic of 3.7
million people and that 300,000 of Estonia's 1.6 million people took
part.
   There was no official estimate from Latvia, but the People's
Front grassroots organization in Riga said about 400,000 of Latvia's
2.7 million people turned out.
   ``I've never lived in an independent Lithuania,'' 30-year-old
graphic illustrator Audrius Ciocys said as he stood on in the line
with his wife and 3-year-old son. ``I believe there will be one _
for my son there must be.''
   Official newspapers in the Baltics gave heavy coverage today to
the human chain. One paper in Tallinn, Estonia, filled most of its
front page with reports and pictures of the event and summarized the
mood with the headline, ``Our Goal is Freedom.''
   Edgar Savisaar, leader of the Estonian People's Front, said he
believed the republic's parliament might decide as soon as October
to issue a republic-wide referendum on independence.
   Miik Titma, the ideology chief of Estonia's Communist Party said
in that republic's capital Tallinn that people there were feeling
more inner freedom, and that would lead them to becoming a free
nation.
   Estonian People's Front activist Heinz Valk declared that by
forming the giant human chain, ``We are proclaiming to each other
and to the whole world that we in the Baltic nations have never
given up our freedom.''
   On Aug. 23, 1939, Hitler and Stalin divided Eastern Europe into
spheres of influence and less than a year later Stalin annexed the
Baltic states.
   In the first reaction by the official Soviet media, the evening
TV news program ``Vremya'' said the human chain should be understood
not as a demand to leave the Soviet Union, but as a call for
historic justice.
   But it said it would be naive to think that the borders could be
redrawn 50 years later.
   Moscow Radio today quoted a Moscow's historian's ``dismissal as
unlawful'' any attempts to claim the Soviet hold on the Baltic
states is invalid because it stems from the 1939 pact.
   Estonia's government leaders joined the chain at its beginning at
a medieval tower near the Gulf of Finland. About 370 miles to the
south in Vilnius, capital of Lithuania, demonstrators held candles
to remember the 1 million Lithuanians they say were killed, jailed
or exiled in 50 years of Soviet rule.
   In Tallinn, the chain was four-deep in places, and then stretched
south out of the windy port.
   Participants still were returning to Tallinn at 4 a.m. from a
protest at the Estonian-Latvian border where a copy of the
Hitler-Stalin agreement was burned in a large bonfire surrounded by
the flags of the independent Baltic states.
   Witnesses said the highway north of Riga toward Estonia was
packed with people.
   Organizers said they needed 1.5 million participants to fill up
the chain, and some gaps were reported.
   Moscow activists tried to organize a sympathy protest in the
capital, but police and a special anti-demonstration unit broke it
up. The official Tass news agency said 75 people were detained.
   In the southwestern Soviet republic of Moldavia, also annexed by
the Soviet Union under the secret agreement, about 10,000 people
attended an outdoor rally in heavy rain.
   They carried the blue, red and yellow national flag of Moldavia,
as well as the flags of the Baltic republics, said Moldavian
People's Front activist Yuri Rozhgo in a telephone interview from
Kishinv, the republic's capital.
   Georgian activists said about 1,500 people gathered in the
capital Tbilisi on Wednesday evening in a demonstration of support
for the Baltic republics.

   Two masked Palestinians kidnapped an Israeli
gold dealer who went to the occupied West Bank at night to collect
debts, the army and Israel radio said today.
   The victim was the first Israeli civilian abducted during the
20-month-old Palestinian uprising. Soldiers put the West Bank town
of Tulkarem and three surrounding villages under curfew and searched
for the victim.
   Also today, a Scottish pathologist who conducted an independent
autopsy on the body of a Palestinian-American killed last week said
he died of a gunshot wound to the back and did not appear to have
been tortured.
   The boy's family alleged that the body showed signs of a beating
and cigarette burns. There were reports that the boy had been in
army custody.
   In another development, Israel's Supreme Court turned down
appeals by four Palestinians seeking to to block army orders that
they be deported, Israel radio reported.
   The deportations would bring to 59 the number of Palestinians
ejected from the occupied lands during the Arab uprising against
Israeli rule.
   In Jerusalem, the body of a 15-year-old Palestinian youth was
taken to the Augusta Victoria Hospital by a cousin who said the
youth died while being questioned by soldiers. The army said they
believed the youth died of natural causes and ordered an autopsy.
   Arab reporters in the occupied Gaza Strip, meanwhile, said a
19-year-old Palestinian killed Wednesday was shot by Israelis
disguised as Arabs who opened fire on masked youths painting
graffiti on walls.
   The army confirmed the death of Iyad Omar Abu Kamal in Gaza City
but denied the youths were painting anti-Israeli slogans. An army
spokesman said the youths were being arrested because they looked
suspicious.
   The spokesman said troops opened fire on the youths only after
they failed to halt.
   Army officials declined comment on whether the soldiers were
disguised.
   A total of 547 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during
the uprising that began in December 1987, and 97 have been slain by
fellow Arabs as alleged collaborators. Thirty-eight Israelis also
have died in the violence.
   In the West Bank, troops searched the city of Tulkarem after the
kidnapping Wednesday night of Israeli gold merchant Shaul Mishaniya.
   The army spokeswoman said Mishaniya was in an Arab taxi when two
masked men armed with knives commandeered the car. Arab reporters
said dozens of masked youths surrounded the car.
   The army spokeswoman quoted Mishaniya's family as saying he
apparently went to the West Bank regularly at night for dealings
with Arab gold merchants and money changers.
   Yuval Neeman, a legislator from the right-wing Tehiya Party, said
on Israel radio that the nearly 10,000 Tulkarem refugee camp
residents should be deported in retaliation for the kidnapping.
   Four deportations approved by the Supreme Court today follow
repeated complaints from the United States that such actions violate
human rights conventions.
   The court ruling said the four were uprising leaders. One of
those ordered deported was a Bir Zeit University physics professor,
Taysir Aruri, whose case has been championed by Israeli and foreign
physicists.
   In Jerusalem, officials said Nasser Nabil Nasrallah, 15, was dead
when brought to Augusta Victoria Hospital on Wednesday night. His
cousin, Hamad Nasrallah, said Nasser died while the two were being
questioned by soldiers in Bethany near Jerusalem.
   Hamad said he was being interrogated by one Israeli serviceman
when a second soldier questioning his cousin on the other side of
the car suddenly cried out, ``Your friend is dead.''
   ``I didn't hear any shots or anything,'' said Hamad. Hospital
officials said they did not know the cause of death.
   The results of an autopsy of the Palestinian-American boy, Amjad
Jibril Tawil, were similar to those of an autopsy conducted by the
government. Tawil's body was found near the West Bank town of
Ramallah on Friday.
   There were reports that Tawil, who was born in Denver, Colo., was
taken into army custody during a stone-throwing clash. The army said
Monday a government autopsy and a reconstruction of events ruled out
involvement by soldiers.
   Scottish pathologist Dr. Derick Pounder told a news conference
today that there was no signs of torture, as the boy's family
alleged, and said the youth died of a single gunshot wound to the
back. Israeli officials said earlier the boy died of a single
gunshot in the chest.

cause of death was believed to be heart failure.
   An unorthodox pioneer in the treatment of schizophrenics, Ronald
David Laing jarred traditional psychiatry with his first book, ``The
Divided Self: An Existential Study in Sanity and Madness,''
published in 1960.
   He rejected notions that schizophrenia is a genetic or biological
aberration, believing instead in the family's role in creating the
disease, although he later became more open to physiological
theories, said his son.
   Laing's views on the strains the nuclear family could put on an
individual's sanity fell in with the rebellious spirit of the 1960s
counterculture, which made him one of its gurus.
   Contending that most psychiatry added to patient misery, he
refused to treat them with drugs or electric shocks unless they
asked for them.
   ``Sanity, Madness and the Family,'' written with A.A. Esterson
and published in 1964, presented case histories based on his
approach to families.
   ``The Politics of Experience@The Bird of Paradise,'' published
in 1967, explored the illnesses of society, presenting the insane,
the criminal and the revolutionary as ``mystical explorers in a
vicious and mechanized world,'' The Times of London said.
   At Kingsley Hall, the London residential treatment hostel he
helped to run, he experimented with the therapeutic use of mescaline
and LSD. He was a prominent campaigner for the legalization of
marijuana.
   In 1964 he founded the Philadelphia Association, a network of
households to house the mentally distressed without giving them
conventional treatment.
   Although Laing's work antagonized many conventional
psychiatrists, he was moured as an innovative contributor to modern
psychiatry.
   ``He made individual contributions to new and constructive
thinking about the care of psychiatric patients,'' said a statement
from the Royal College of Psychiatrists.
   The Fontana Companion to Modern Thought recognized the continuing
impact of Laing's ideas on orthodox British psychiatry, ``as
witnessed by the greater attention now paid to the dynamics of a
family one of whose members is disturbed.''
   Born Oct.7, 1927 and raised in a Glasgow tenement block, Laing
received his doctorate at Glasgow University and served with a
psychiatric unit in the army before going on to study psychoanalysis
at the Tavistock Institute in London.
   In the 1970s, having gained international renown, he became
interested in Zen Buddhism, wrote poems, and published transcripts
of conversations between himself and his children in the U.S.
magazine Harpers.
   He is survived by his common-law wife, Margarita, an infant son
by her; his first wife, Anne, and their daughters Caron and Fiona;
and sons Paul and Adrian, said Adrian Laing.
   Fiona, his first daughter, spent years in mental institutions and
was treated for schizophrenia, according to Adrian, 31, who said he
is writing a book on the influence of this on his father's work. His
survivors also include two sons from a second marriage, Adam and
Max, and a daughter Natasha, as well as a child Benjamin by another
common-law wife, said Adrian.
   ``He was an anti-establishment character, but wasn't an
anti-psychiatrist,'' according to Adrian, who said he had studied
his father's works and accompanied his father to conferences.
   ``He wanted to listen more to what people were saying, to look at
schizophrenic minds from their point of view,'' he said. ``His idea
was just to let them go crazy, just let them go on with it.''
   ``He said you've got to understand the politics of the family.''
   Laing's other writings included, ``Reason and Violence,'' ``The
Politics of Experience,'' and his 1985 account of the first 30 years
of his life, ``The Making of a Psychiatrist.''

   Thomas T. Demery, a top housing official in the
Reagan administration, sought the help of senators, a congressman
and a key Bush aide in an unsuccessful bid to become secretary of
Housing and Urban Development, according to files released today.
   As assistant secretary for housing for two years, ``I have become
greatly challenged and sensitized to the public policy questions
surrounding the homeless, the availability of low-income housing,
and the difficulty the elderly and first-time homebuyers face in
finding affordable housing,'' Demery said in a form letter dated
Dec. 7, 1988.
   The letter was sent to Sens. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.; Donald
Riegle, D-Mich.; Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; Rep. Carl Pursell, R-Mich.;
and Robert Teeter, who was director of the office of then
President-elect Bush.
   Demery enclosed his resume and asked for ``an opportunity to
discuss these issues with you.''
   Jack Kemp, then a congressman and failed GOP presidential
candidate, ultimately won the job; Demery has gone into private
business but his conduct at HUD is under scrutiny in the
investigation of alleged fraud and abuse at the agency during the
Reagan administration.
   The letters were contained in a box of files opened to the press
today under the Freedom of Information Act. However, most of
Demery's office files are missing, according to James Lafferty,
HUD's deputy assistant secretary for public affairs. Demery has said
he doesn't have them and Lafferty says the department has no
evidence that he may have taken them.

   Two more bodies were found in the River Thames,
bringing to 50 the number recovered since a pleasure boat was sunk,
police said today.
   Also today, an appeal fund was launched to help those affected by
the accident, in which a barge rammed the pleasure boat. Organizers
at the London borough of Southwark, which started the appeal, said
the fund was needed to help dependents of survivors and those who
died.
   ``We didn't at first know what the consequences would be, but
it's become clear we are talking about a major tragic disaster,''
Mayor Tony Ritchie told British Broadcasting Corp. television.
   ``There's almost certainly going to be dependents, both of those
who have survived and of those who unfortunately and sadly have
died, who will need assistance in the weeks and months ahead,'' he
said.
   The 90-ton Marchioness pleasure cruiser sank early Sunday near
the Southwark Bridge in central London after being hit by the
1,475-ton dredger Bowbelle.
   Scotland Yard police headquarters said two more bodies were
recovered Wednesday night, bringing the total to 50 found. Police
said 83 people survived, and six more bodies were being sought.
   Because no list was made of those boarding the vessel for a
late-night disco-dance voyage, the Yard has revised its figures of
survivors and missing several times. ``It's constantly changing,''
said a police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It's
confused at best.''
   Its latest figure of those on board was 139. That was less than
the vessel's certified capacity of 149 passengers and two crew
members.
   The Marchioness was tugged to its last berth on Wednesday, in
Greenwich where, after police inquiries into the accident, it will
be scrapped.

   A $30,000 kidney-shaped swimming pool
built partly on city property is about to go down the drain.
   City water commissioners voted Wednesday to order developer David
Brady to get rid of the pool, which is partly in his back yard and
partly on land owned by the Manchester Water Works.
   Brady said he encroached on about 5,000 square feet of city land
by mistake, but commissioners said they weren't convinced.
   The deciding factor apparently was the difference between Brady's
pool proposal on his application for a city building permit and the
pool that eventually was built.
   The permit showed a lap pool entirely on Brady's land, but the
finished product was much larger and extended more than 50 feet over
the property line.
   Brady says his building crew neglected to get a new permit when
plans for the pool were changed. The commissioners rejected his
offer to buy or lease the city land for 1{ times its market value.

   Dan and Chandelle Summer don't get to
argue in court anymore.
   Summer is an assistant district attorney and his wife is a
defense attorney. They squared off in a burglary trial this year.
   But shortly after the case ended in a hung jury, District
Attorney C. Andrew Fuller told Summer he could no longer handle
cases involving his wife's clients.
   Mrs. Summer sued Fuller, claiming his policy hurt her business by
causing delays in court cases when other attorneys had to be found
to fill in for her husband.
   U.S. District Judge William C. O'Kelley, in an order signed last
week, agreed there is no Georgia law preventing the two from
opposing each other in a court case. But he also said Fuller has the
right to decide which assistant handles any case.
   Mrs. Summer said she plans to appeal. Her husband declined to
comment.
   ``I wished the judge had found that harm had been done and gone
on to decide the underlying issue, which is basically marital
discrimination,'' she said.
   ``There was never a suggestion that we compromised our
positions,'' she added. ``When we get home, we're too tired to
discuss law. It's boring. We argue about other subjects, like who's
going to do the dishes tonight.''
   Fuller said he instituted the policy because he wanted to avoid
any appearance of impropriety, and he had been forming the policy
for months before the burglary trial.
   ``We want to put forward the image that indicates everyone is
being represented fairly,'' he said Tuesday.

<HEAD>Fire Drill Simulates Space Shuttle Explosion, Radiactive Leak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA and other officials who staged a
safety drill to simulate a space shuttle explosion that released
radioactive material said there were a few glitches that need to be
ironed out.
   More than 200 federal, state and local officials participated
Wednesday in a six-hour test of the communications network that
would link all the agencies in case of such an explosion, a
possibility that NASA said is extremely remote.
   Joel Reynolds, NASA safety chief, said the test simulated a
launch pad fire that the astronauts were able to escape before the
shuttle Atlantis exploded, causing the release of a small amount of
radiation, but not enough to order an evacuation.
   ``It was the type of thing where we'd tell people to get inside
their cars or a building to prevent inhalation of the material,'' he
said.
   Reynolds said there were problems with some communications links
and with a computer-generated model of the radiation dispersal
pattern.
   ``But that's why we had the exercise, to work out the rough spots
and help us work together as a team,'' he said. ``We'll sit down
tomorrow and assess what has to be changed.''
   Atlantis is scheduled for launch Oct. 12 with the Galileo
spacecraft. The crew of five astronauts is to release the payload on
the start of a six-year outward trip to orbit the planet Jupiter.
   Galileo will be powered by a pair of 122-pound radioisotope
thermoelectric generators, each containing about 24 pounds of highly
toxic plutonium-238 dioxide. Instruments called thermocouples
convert the heat released by the plutonium's decay into electricity.
   ``I can't see how those (plutonium) packages can break apart ...
but we want to be prepared,'' Reynolds said.
   The safety drill involved safety officials from NASA, the
Departments of Energey and Defense, the Environmental Protection
Agency, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and state and local
radiation protection and law enforcement organizations.
   Federal law requires that NASA have a written contingency plan
that would be enacted for any launch accident involving radioactive
material.
   Some anti-nuclear and environmental groups have protested the use
of plutonioum on a spacecraft, citing the 1986 space shuttle
Challenger explosion as an example of how things can go wrong. They
have said the radioactive fallout could result in many incidents of
cancer in the area.
   NASA estimates the odds of another shuttle disaster at somewhere
between 1-in-80 and 1-in-800.
   The agency said an exhaustive post-Challenger safety review
indicates the chances of a launch accident in which substantial
quantities of plutonium, pulverized to breathable form, could be
released is about 1-in-2,700. And even then, NASA said, any
contamination would be minor.
   The nuclear generators were tested to withstand blast pressure
effects of up to 2,000 pounds per square inch. The worst-case
overpressures created in the Challenger explosion was between 200
and 400 psi.

<TEXT>
   Shiite Moslem militants today vowed to
attack French warships reported cruising 40 miles off Lebanon if
they approach the coast or seek to aid the country's beleaguered
Christians.
   The threat was made by Sheik Abbas Mousawi, a leader of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, after 150 Shiite
officials met in the southern port of Tyre to close ranks against
``this American-Israeli-French plot.''
   The black-turbanned Mousawi, speaking to reporters after the
meeting, repeatedly stabbed a clenched fist in the air as he
declared: ``Our battle will horrify everybody.''
   France has said the warships were dispatched on a ``humanitarian
mission'' to evacuate about 7,000 French citizens, mainly Lebanese
Christians with dual nationality, if the situation deteriorates.
   But Syria's allied Moslem militias claim the French, who once
ruled Lebanon and have traditionally been the Christians' protector,
are allying with the Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun.
   His forces, besieged in the Christian heartland north of Beirut,
have been battling the Syrians and their allies for five months.
   Both sides fired sporadic artillery salvoes in and around Beirut
today, violating a week-old cease-fire.
   Police said one person was killed and three wounded. That raised
the casualty toll since the fighting erupted March 8 to 791 killed
and 2,208 wounded.
   Soviet envoy Gennady Tarasov arrived in Beirut from Damascus, the
Syrian capital, to seek ways to end the bloodshed as the leaders of
Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Shiite Amal militia, until recently
at each other's throats, gathered in Tyre.
   An eight-member delegation from the European Economic Community
left Paris today for Beirut to evaluate the emergency aid needs of
the Lebanese population, the French Foreign Ministry announced.
   The French government, apparently seeking to defuse the
threatened confrontation with Syria's militia allies, announced
Wednesday it was trimming the task force from eight to six warships.
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said the cutback was
because the fighting has eased in the last few days. But the
decision came amid mounting Moslem threats to fire on the vessels
and kill U.S. hostages if the French intervene.
   Chevenement said on French radio today that the dispatch of
French warships off the coast of Lebanon was ordered last week
``when we could expect the worst, namely an assault on Beirut.''
   Lebanese military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said some French vessels were cruising 40 miles offshore, ``distant
from commercial shipping lanes,'' awaiting other units en route from
France.
   Their number was not known, but Chevenement confirmed the
aircraft carrier Foch, carrying 2,000 troops, was in the eastern
Mediterranean.
   The frigate Estienne d'Orves, one of the two ships Chevenement
said were being pulled back, was anchored at Larnaca, Cyprus, 100
miles northwest of Lebanon, and was expected to remain there.
   Druse leader Walid Jumblatt, whose Progressive Socialist Party is
fighting alongside the Syrians, asked Algerian President Chadli
Bendjedid to persuade France to withdraw its flotilla and ``prevent
any act of piracy against the Arab people of Lebanon.''
   The party said Jumblatt told Bendjedid that Moslem and leftist
forces will ``confront the new crusaders' war whatever the cost.''
   The Syrian-sponsored Nationalist Front, the umbrella group for
the Progressive Socialist Party and 10 other militias, said
Wednesday the French mission was an ``aggression'' and threatened to
shell any French ship that approached Lebanon's 130-mile coastline.
   Police said two unidentified war planes flew an apparent
reconnaissance mission at high altitude over Beirut and the
confrontation lines in the mountains southeast of the capital
Thursday.
   ``They were definitely not Israeli planes,'' said a police
spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing regulations.
   Tarasov, head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Middle East
department, met acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a
Syrian-backed Moslem cabinet vying for power with Aoun's Christian
government.
   The envoy was to meet Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a
Shiite Moslem, later before crossing Beirut's dividing Green Line
for talks with Aoun and other Christian leaders.
   Tarasov discussed the Lebanese crisis in Damascus Wednesday with
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
   Aoun, 54, has declared a ``war of liberation'' against the 40,000
Syrian troops deployed in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   The U.S.-trained general charges the Syrians have abrogated that
mandate by openly siding with the Moslems.
   Syria, Moscow's main Arab ally which considers Lebanon vital to
its strategic security, refuses to withdraw. Arab League mediators
blame the Syrians for blocking peace efforts.

   Police fired tear gas today at
hundreds of protesting university students and arrested 22 white
women from a civil rights group in a crackdown on supporters of a
nationwide defiance campaign.
   Police headquarters reported unrest in nine black and mixed-race
townships near Cape Town and said four officers had been injured in
rioting. Numerous clashes were reported between stone-throwing
youths and police units using tear gas and whips.
   Anti-apartheid leaders coordinating the defiance campaign accused
the government of distorting their intentions, and they challenged
acting President F.W. de Klerk to face one of them in a nationally
televised debate. There was no immediate response from de Klerk's
office to the challenge, announced at a news conference in
Johannesburg.
   The white women, members of the Black Sash civil rights
organization, stood in a market square in central Cape Town with
banners that read, ``One Person, One Vote,'' and ``Defiance is the
Right To Peaceful Protest.''
   Police declared the demonstration illegal under
state-of-emergency regulations and ordered the women to disperse.
When they refused to do so, they were led into a police bus.
   Among those arrested was Mary Burton, president of the Black
Sash. The nationwide group runs assistance centers for blacks and
regularly stages anti-government demonstrations.
   About 200 bystanders, both black and white, cheered in support of
the Black Sash as the women were arrested.
   At the University of Cape Town, about 1,000 students, black and
white, marched across a highway bordering the campus before being
dispersed by police sing whips and tear gas. Many of the students
regrouped and marched back to the campus behind a protester carrying
the black-green-and-gold flag of the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla movement.
   Since anti-apartheid groups launched the mass defiance campaign
Aug. 2, there have been almost daily confrontations between police
and demonstrators in the Cape Town area.
   Police have broken up many protests, often with tear gas, and
arrested and detained dozens of activists. Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, was among those
tear-gassed at a demonstration Wednesday.
   The protesters are attempting to end segregation of hospitals,
schools, neighborhoods, beaches and other facilities.
   Organizers have planned rallies to protest an international rugby
team that is touring South Africa and scheduled to play the national
squad in Cape Town on Saturday. Anti-apartheid groups say the tour
breaks the international sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. has won limited state and
federal permission to use a controversial chemical to remove crude
oil from shorelines coated by the nation's largest oil spill.
   Authorities gave permission Wednesday for Exxon to use Corexit
9580 on Smith Island, heavily oiled when the tanker Exxon Valdez hit
a reef in Prince William Sound on March 24 and spilled nearly 11
million gallons of crude oil. About 3.5 miles of the island's shore
remain heavily oiled.
   ``We're giving them the opportunity to show they can use Corexit
effectively,'' said Steve Provant, a U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency official on loan to the state.
   Provant said Alaska officials believe the solvent poses ``some
toxicological risk,'' but said the gamble may be balanced by the
stepped up removal of oil from shorelines. Exxon's use of the
chemical will be monitored closely by state and federal agencies
before expanded application will be allowed, he said.
   The solvent is designed to soften and dissolve weathered oil,
lifting it off rocks. Exxon said Corexit 9580, one in a line of a
products put out by Exxon Chemical for use in battling oil spills,
has low toxicity and is biodegradable. Very little of the substance
will remain in the water, the company said.
   ``I feel that Corexit is no more toxic than the oil we're washing
off,'' said Hans Jahn, an Exxon arctic resarch scientist who headed
the field testing of Corexit. ``I see no disadvantages, only
advantages. We can wash beaches faster.''
   The kerosene-based solvent has been reformulated since
disappointing tests earlier this year.
   The company plans to spray the $10-a-gallon liquid on oiled
shores and let it stand for about 15 minutes. The oil and chemical
then are to be washed off shore and collected by skimmers and
absorbent booms. Next, the areas will be treated with fertilizer to
stimulate growth of microbes that feed on remaining hydrocarbons.
   Exxon officials said the company has 1,000 55-gallon barrels of
the solvent in Valdez and expects to need only part of that.
   More than 800 miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound and
the Gulf of Alaska were oiled after the spill. Crews using hot,
high-pressure water and absorbent materials have removed some oil
from part of the sullied shores, but the company and state officials
have not agreed on what constitutes clean. They also are at odds
over Exxon's plans to end clean-up work for the year on Sept. 15,
and to assess shoreline conditions in 1990 before making a
commitment to perform more cleanup.

<TEXT>
   More than 100 East Germans who had
sought refuge in West Germany's Embassy in Budapest were allowed to
leave the country at dawn today, the state news ageny MTI reported.
   It said the Hungarian government, ``on the basis of humanitarian
considerations,'' allowed 101 East Germans to leave Hungary with
International Red Cross travel documents.
   ``MTI has been authorized to state that this solution is to be
considered an exception and may not serve as a precedent,'' the
official report said.
   In Vienna, diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity
said 150 East Germans were involved.
   The group was flown from Budapest to Vienna, where the refugees
boarded buses for West Germany, Austrian Red Cross officials said.
   In Bonn, the West German Foreign Ministry confirmed the move, but
it was not clear from its announcement if the transfer took place
with the consent of East Germany.
   At least 5,000 East Germans have reached the West via Hungary
since mid-July. Communist Hungary, which has reduced border
restrictions with Austria, has embraced social and political reform,
while East Germany maintains a hard line.
   The Bonn-based Die Welt newspaper said today the East German
government is planning to impose strict new travel regulations to
Hungary to stem the flow of refugees fleeing to the West across
Hungary's border with Austria.
   East Germany denied the report. The state-run news agency ADN
quoted a Foreign Ministry official as saying the report on planned
travel restrictions was ``an outright lie.''
   ``These lies and fabrications are being spread in Cold War style
to create confusion and to slander East Germany,'' ADN quoted the
unidentified official as saying.
   ``The truth is that travel to Hungary as well as to Bulgaria and
Romania continues as usual,'' ADN said.
   A West German government spokesman in Bonn said the permission
for the 101 refugees to leave Hungary was seen as a result of
repeated trips to Budapest by state secretary Juergen Sudhoff.
   Word of the departure of the East Germans holed up in the embassy
came after Hungarian border guards Wednesday stepped up their
surveillance of the border with Austria.
   About 250 East Germans had arrived in Austria by dawn Wednesday,
but only about 30 more during the day, reporters and other witnesses
said.
   An apparent mass escape attempt of East Germans was obstructed
Wednesday by Hungarian border guards in the Lake Neusiedl area along
the Hungarian-Austrian frontier, well-informed sources said.
   Early on Wednesday, Hungarian guards, some of them with dogs,
were seen manning the border at 130-foot intervals.
   An incident involving the occupants of three buses was confirmed
today by the government daily Magyar Hirlap, which said there were
signs the exodus of East Germans was organized, and that East
Germans were getting assistance from foreigners.
   It said on Wednesday at Sopronpuszta that three buses, three
taxis and two cars pulled up near the border, and that the occupants
started running toward the crossing. The paper hinted that the East
Germans were prevented from crossing the border but did not
elaborate.
   Magyar Hirlap also said that at Sopron, a main border crossing to
Austria, the border guards' barracks are filled with several hundred
would-be escapees.
   In reply to a question about their fate, an unidentified deputy
commander of the guards said, ``We'll release them, only to see them
back again.''

   Drug traffickers today bombed the
headquarters of two political parties and set fire to two
politicians' homes in Medellin, declaring war on the government in
retaliation for a crackdown on the narcotics trade.
   Police said one person was killed in the bombing of the Liberal
Party offices in Medellin, an industrial city that serves as a base
for the world's biggest cocaine cartel.
   Traffickers also bombed the Conservative Party headquarters and
set fire to the weekend homes of two prominent politicians, former
finance minister Edgard Gutierrez of the Liberal Party and
Conservative Sen. Ignacio Velez Escobar, police said.
   Officials said they also found powerful bombs in suitcases left
at the Medellin offices of two national radio networks, Caracol and
Radio Cadena Nacional, and defused them.
   The wave of attacks occurred between midnight and 4 a.m. It
follows an roundup of suspected drug traffickers and suspects in the
slaying on Friday of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a leading presidential
candidate who was a foe of Colombia's huge drug trade.
   At the Caracol station, the bombers left behind a communique
dated Wednesday and signed by ``The Extraditables,'' a group known
to carry out bloody acts for the Medellin drug cartel.
   ``We declare total and absolute war on the government, on the
industrial and political oligarchy, on the journalists that have
attacked and ravaged us, on the judges that have sold out to the
government, on the extraditing magistrates, on the presidents of the
unions and all those who who persecuted and attacked us,'' it said.
   ``We won't respect the families of those who have not respected
our families. ...We will burn and destroy the industries, the
properties and the mansions of the oligarchies,'' it said.
   The known leaders of the Medellin cartel are Pablo Escobar, Jorge
Ochoa and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. Medellin, with 2 million
inhabitants, is 215 miles north of Bogota. The cartels based there
are believed responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine that reaches
the United States.
   In another development, U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
announced Wednesday a $2 million program designed to help protect
Colombian judges and others threatened by hitmen hired by the drug
cartels.
   Police also said they arrested Bernardo Londono Quintero in a
raid Wednesday on a daughter's apartment in an upper-class
neighborhood in the Caribbean city of Barranquilla.
   Quintero, 60, nicknamed ``the diplomat'' for his smooth manner,
has long been considered a pioneer of Colombia's narcotics business,
which began expanding in the late 1960s.
   Law enforcement officials say he managed to retain some of his
power when new, violent organizations began muscling into the
business in the mid-1970s. Quintero offered no resistance during his
arrest, but a .38-caliber revolver was seized in the raid, police
said.
   He told local reporters in Barranquilla that he used to have
``legal problems'' but had resolved them with the Justice Ministry
more than a year ago. He denied any role in drug trafficking.
   An extradition request from the United States, dating to the
mid-1980s, is believed to have been filed with Colombian
authorities. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said he could not comment.
   The drug lords who run today's cocaine industry remained at large
Wednesday.
   But police reported the arrests of several alleged drug figures,
including Rafael Orlandes Gamboa, for whom Bogota newspapers said a
U.S. extradition request is pending. Officials at the U.S. Justice
and State departments, and the Drug Enforcement Administration said
they had never heard of him.
   Police also reported the arrest of Helena Beatriz Rodriquez in
the coastal resort of Cartagena. They said she was wanted in the
United States on drug-related charges, but U.S. officials in
Washington said they were unfamiliar with her.
   The most prominent alleged drug figure arrested so far, Eduardo
Martinez Romero, was picked up during a weekend dragnet.
   Police and U.S. authorities said they were trying to arrange
speedy extradition of Martinez, an alleged money manager for the
Medellin cartel but that the paperwork might take a week or more.
   As part of the crackdown, President Virgilio Barco established
emergency procedures for extraditing traffickers wanted in the
United States.
   The Supreme Court nullified the extradition treaty with
Washington in June 1987, after years of intimidation of the
judiciary. At least 220 judges and other officials have been killed.
   Barco also authorized seizures of traffickers' possessions.
Police and soldiers continued raids Wednesday on mansions, farms,
office buildings, restaurants and other property belived owned by
the drug bosses.
   Carlos Lemos Simonds, the communications minister, declared
``there's a firm decision'' to extradite suspects but said the U.S.
bureaucracy must act quickly. He said Barco's emergency measures
empower police to hold suspected traffickers for up to seven days
without charges, then they must be freed.
   Lemos asked that Washington provide more aid for the
anti-narcotics campaign, then added: ``The other help we need is to
lower consumption and demand (of drugs) in the United States.''

<HEAD>Scientists Isolate Gene for Cystic Fibrosis</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates throughout with comments from today.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have discovered and isolated the gene
that causes cystic fibrosis when it is defective, a major step that
could help in developing treatments for the fatal disease, a
scientist said today.
   Analysis suggests the gene plays a role in transporting
substances across cell membranes, a process scientists suspect lies
at the heart of cystic fibrosis, said Lap-Chee Tsui of the Research
Institute at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.
   The discovery will ``open up the door to more focused
experiments'' to find treatments that strike at the basic cause of
the disease, he said in a telephone inteview.
   ``This is one of the most significant discoveries in the history
of human genetics,'' said Dr. Ronald Worton, chief geneticist at
Hospital for Sick Children.
   For cystic fibrosis, the finding is ``the most exciting event
since this disease was first described in the medical literature 50
years ago,'' Robert Beall, executive vice president of the Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation in Bethesda, Md., declared today.
   Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal genetic disease of
young people in North America. Some 30,000 Americans have it, and
1,000 to 1,200 new cases are diagnosed each year.
   Half of cystic fibrosis patients die before reaching their
mid-20s, mostly from respiratory complications. Treatment now is
limited to fighting the effects of the disease rather than the cause
of the illness itself.
   Apart from cystic fibrosis patients, some 12 million Americans
carry a defective form of the gene, but do not suffer the disease
because they also have a normal version. The disease appears only in
people who have inherited a defective form of the gene from each
parent.
   The new work will help in detecting people who carry a single
defective version of the gene and could pass it on to their
offspring, Tsui said.
   The disease makes the body produce abnormally thick, stick mucus
that clogs the lungs and digestive system, interfering with
breathing and digestion. Scientists believe the problem stems from a
defect in transporting of tiny charged particles across cell walls.
   In the new work, researchers found that the protein produced by
the gene bears a structural resemblance to proteins that are known
to play a role in transport across cell walls.
   The new research will be reported in the journal Science by a
team of more than two dozen scientists, led by Tsui, Jack Riordan of
the Research Institute, and Francis Collins of the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute and the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.
   Scientists say they will now focus on how the gene functions and
how the defect can be rectified.

<HEAD>Defense Rests After 10 Months of Testimony in Marathon Trial</HEAD>

   The defense reluctantly rested its case in the
marathon McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, now in its third
year, after questioning a man whose child prompted investigation of
the school six years ago.
   The attorneys for Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin
Buckey, ended their presentation Wednesday after 10 months of
testimony from more than 40 witnesses.
   ``On behalf of Mr. Buckey, we will rest our case in chief,''
attorney Danny Davis announced after the witness left the stand.
   ``On behalf of Mrs. Buckey, we rest,'' said attorney Dean Gits.
   The lawyers repeatedly proposed more witnesses during the course
of the trial, but Superior Judge William Pounders refused their
requests, citing the need to bring the proceedings to a conclusion.
   Pounders has vowed to have jury deliberations begin by Dec. 1.
After the defense rested, the prosecution began presenting rebuttal
evidence.
   Buckey, 30, and his mother, 62, are charged with 64 counts of
molestation and a combined count of conspiracy. They are the only
defendants left in a case that began five years ago with seven
teachers charged. The district attorney's office dismissed
accusations against five teachers after an 18-month preliminary
hearing, saying there was insufficient evidence to convict them.
   Both defendants testified during the defense case and adamantly
denied that they molested any children.
   The last witness to take the stand, the father of the boy whose
allegations prompted the case, denied molesting his own child. The
boy, who was 2{ when he attended the preschool, never testified.
   The defense had asserted that the child was molested at home
early in the case but retracted the statement this week. Davis says
he now believes the child was not molested by anyone.
   The prosecution spent 14 months presenting testimony from 61
witnesses during the trial, which has set records for length and for
cost, which has been estimated at $15 million.
   Jurors have dropped out because of illness or job problems, and
only one alternate now remains in addition to the 12 regular jurors.
The judge has voiced concern that loss of two more jurors would
create a mistrial and he has urged all lawyers to speed
presentations.

   Two teen-agers who had known each
other about two months visited Walt Disney World and the Disney-MGM
Studios, then left a note and leaped to their deaths from a 14th
floor balcony, officials said.
   Jerry Heitzman, 17, of Tipp City, Ohio, and Christine Reutter,
18, of Kettering, Ohio, were killed late Tuesday when they hit the
roof of the first-floor restaurant at the Howard Johnson at Walt
Disney Village, said Orange County sheriff's spokeswoman Denise
Gainer.
   ``They each left a suicide note that said they cared very deeply
for one another, and that they wanted to live with each other for
eternity,'' sheriff's spokesman Jim Solomons said.
   ``Since he was younger and she was to go into the Air Force in
November, they didn't feel they could be together,'' said Andrea
Carter, a friend of the Reutter family.
   Ms. Reutter tried to kill herself with an overdose of pills
nearly two years ago, said Megan Fitzgerald, a friend of Ms.
Reutter, the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News reported today.
   The pair's parents were unaware that they had traveled to
Florida, investigators learned.
   The teen-agers, who had known each other for about two months,
drove to Florida in Heitzman's pickup, checked into the hotel
Saturday and were scheduled to check out Wednesday, Ms. Gainer said.
They visited both Disney World and the Disney-MGM Studios.

<HEAD>Defense: Mrs. Helmsley Didn't Know About Phony Bills</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hotel magnate Leona Helmsley was so paranoid
about being overcharged and so nasty to her employees that they
schemed to bill her personal expenses to her businesses without her
knowing, her lawyer says.
   ``This system was in no way designed to cheat the Internal
Revenue Service,'' the attorney, Gerald Feffer, said in closing
arguments Wednesday to the jury in Mrs. Helmsley's criminal tax
evasion trial.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is accused of evading $1.2 million in federal
taxes by charging personal expenses, including renovations at her
Connecticut estate, to her businesses. Her husband, Harry, also was
charged but was separated from the trial because of deteriorating
mental capacity.
   Former aides Frank Turco and Joseph Licari are co-defendants at
the trial, charged with assisting in the scheme. Their lawyers
planned to present closing statements today.
   Feffer said Mrs. Helmsley had nothing to do with the phony bills.
   He said the Helmsleys had legitimately charged their $5 billion
real estate and hotel empire for half the cost of renovating and
operating their $11 million Connecticut estate because they used it
for business.
   The problems began when Mrs. Helmsley refused to pay contractors
hired to work on the mansion, Dunnellen Hall, he said.
   ``It is clear from the evidence that Mrs. Helmsley believes she
was being ripped off, that she was absolutely paranoid that she was
being overcharged,'' Feffer said.
   Her employees designed a system to pay the bills ``and yet at the
same time minimize the hassle and problems of dealing with Mrs.
Helmsley,'' he said.
   ``There's no question that Mrs. Helmsley was a very tough person
to deal with,'' Feffer said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Cathy Seibel painted a different picture
of the Helmsley finances during 1983-85.
   Seibel said Mrs. Helmsley intentionally evaded more than $1
million in taxes by charging personal expenses to her businesses
because she was cheap and arrogant.
   ``If there's one thing you learned at this trial, it's that just
because you're rich doesn't mean you're not cheap,'' Seibel told the
jury. ``The Helmsleys kept an eagle eye on every penny.''
   Seibel brought up testimony from Mrs. Helmsley's former
housekeeper that Mrs. Helmsley once told her, ``We don't pay taxes.
Only the little people pay taxes.''

<HEAD>Angolan Guerrilla Leader Says Truce Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi said today
that a truce in Angola's 14-year-old civil war was over, and he
urged his rebel forces to resume fighting.
   In a statement issued from the rebels' southern Angolan
stronghold of Jamba and released in Lisbon, Savimbi said: ``The
Angolan people, to their infinite sorrow, accept that the war has
restarted.''
   Savimbi accused Angolan government forces of launching a military
offensive on Aug. 17.
   A cease-fire began June 24, two days after Savimbi sealed a truce
with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos at a summit of 18
African leaders at Gbadolite, Zaire.
   Although the truce effectively collapsed one week later, with
both sides swapping accusations of military attacks, government and
rebel representatives continued to hold sporadic peace talks in
Zaire until last week.
   Savimbi's statement also said his group, the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola, ``rejected in the most violent
terms'' a communique released by eight African leaders who discussed
Angolan peace prospects Tuesday in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare.
   The leaders supported dos Santos' claim that Savimbi agreed to
accept ``temporary and voluntary retirement'' during a cease-fire
and peace negotiations, and that guerrillas should recognize and be
integrated into exisiting Angolan political structures.
   The Western-backed guerrillas have been fighting the government
and its Cuban allies to force a power-sharing agreement since
shortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The guerrilla movement was not party to U.S.-brokered
international accords signed in New York by which South Africa
pledged to halt aid to the guerrillas and allow Angola's southern
neighbor, Namibia, to gain independence. In return, Cuba began a
phased withdrawal of its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola.
   The rebels still receive annually between $15 million and $18
million in U.S. military aid.

<HEAD>Starr Wins Extension Of Ban On Release Of Album</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ex-Beatle Ringo Starr won a preliminary court
battle today in his effort to block release of an album he recorded
in 1987 but now wants to keep out of circulation.
   Superior Court Judge Clarence Cooper, who earlier imposed a
30-day ban on distribution of the album, agreed to extend the
restraining order until Starr's lawsuit to kill the album is tried,
possibly in October.
   The restraining order blocks record producer Chips Moman and CRS
Records, base in College Park, Ga., from releasing the album.
   Moman has said the record could make $3.5 million if it is
released while Starr is on his current U.S. concert tour.
   Starr, who recently underwent treatment for alcoholism, has said
the record was marred by his drinking problem.
   ``Certain nights we were all under the influence,'' the former
Beatles drummer said in a deposition filed earlier this week.
   Starr also is unhappy with the album because he didn't play the
drums on the recordings.
   ``The drummer (Gene Crispin) did, you know, a fine job, but it
wasn't me,'' he said. ``So the sound is different, the attitude is
different.''
   Starr said that during the recording sessions with Moman in a
studio in Memphis, Tenn., he and the other musicians often drank.
   ``We would send out for wine, or there would be tequila there or
cognac or whatever, you know, anybody felt like drinking, vodka.
There was always plenty of alcohol on the premises,'' Starr said.
   Moman testified in an earlier hearing that he did not allow
liquor in his studio.

   John F. Kennedy Jr. has pleaded guilty to
speeding and driving an uninspected car, but plans to contest
charges that his car was unregistered and uninsured, a newspaper
reports.
   Kennedy, 28, is expected to appear Friday before an
administrative law judge at a state Motor Vehicles office, the Daily
News reported today.
   The lack of insurance on Kennedy's 1973 Volkswagen was the most
serious offense cited on July 7, said George Filieau, a Motor
Vehicles spokesman.
   Kennedy, sworn in this week as an assistant district attorney in
Manhattan, pleaded guilty by mail and paid what he thought was owed
for the speeding and inspection tickets.
   However, his check was returned because it was insufficient and
he still has to register the car, according to Filieau.
   He could be fined $100 for pleading guilty to driving an
uninsured vehicle; if he contests the charge and is found guilty,
his license must be revoked for one year and he could be fined up to
$1,000.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers today elected Solidarity activist
Tadeusz Mazowiecki as the East bloc's first non-Communist prime
minister, handing him a historic mandate to lead Poland out of
economic ruin.
   Mazowiecki, a former political prisoner, was approved by a 378-4
vote in the Sejm, the lower house of the National Assembly. There
were 41 abstentions.
   Members of every party, including the Communists, supported
Mazowiecki.
   The vote was greeted by a standing ovation, and Mazowiecki
immediately rose to say, ``I am very touched at this moment. I thank
you, high chamber, for this great proof of trust.
   ``I am counting on cooperation with the Sejm and Senate. ... This
moment shall become an essential moment in order for us to raise up
Poland together.''
   Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader, said: ``I will do everything
so that my premier, my child, our child, passes the test before
society.''
   Speaking to reporters in Gdansk, Walesa called the election ``an
event without precedent'' and wished Mazowiecki luck in
``transforming our country from a totalitarian system to democracy.''
   The Sejm alone elects the premier. Thirty-seven members of the
460-member chamber were absent for the vote.
   After Mazowiecki's election, 15 Communist lawmakers submitted a
proposal to drop from the Constitution a clause that mandates the
Communist Party be the ``leading political force'' in society.
   Deputy Jozef Bogusz told the state PAP news agency that the
proposed amendment was ``in connection with the new political
situation (and) historical moment.'' There was no indication when
the proposal would be put to a vote.
   Mazowiecki had been recommended for the office of prime minister
by Walesa and nominated on Saturday by Communist President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, who accepted Walesa's once-inconceivable proposition to
form a non-Communist government in the Soviet Union's largest and
most strategic East bloc ally.
   Jaruzelski did not attend the Sejm session. But Mazowiecki went
to Belvedere Palace for a 30-minute meeting with Jaruzelski after
the vote, the state PAP news agency said.
   No details of the meeting were disclosed, but at a news
conference later Mazowiecki said his initial contacts with the
president led him to expect ``full respect.''
   In Moscow, a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yuri Gremitskikh,
greeted the election with equanimity.
   ``The Soviet side takes the decision into account and we shall
regard comrade Mazowiecki as our partner in the relations that link
our two countries,'' he said.
   President Bush praised Mazowiecki's election. ``We wish him well,
of course,'' Bush said in Maine. ``It's a fascinating period in
eastern Europe.''
   Jaruzelski agreed to nominate Mazowiecki after Solidarity earlier
refused to participate in a government formed by the Communists
following parliamentary elections in June.
   Walesa argued that because Solidarity won the elections
overwhelmingly, it had a mandate to form a government that would win
public confidence.
   In an initial act of support for a Solidarity-led government,
workers today suspended several small strikes around the country at
the union's urging. The strikes included walkouts at four coal mines
in the Silesia region and one at a trucking enterprise in Katowice,
the state's PAP news agency said.
   Poland is wracked by high inflation, a shortage of basic goods,
low worker productivity and a $39 billion foreign debt.
   Mazowiecki said Wednesday he planned to present a government
within a week. He said he could not say how many of the 19
government ministries would be offered the Communists, or to
Solidarity and its allied parties.
   Mazowiecki is under pressure from the Communists and the Soviet
Union to keep substantial Communist representation in the
government. The Communist Party has demanded a full partnership role.
   Solidarity already has promised the Communists will continue to
head the defense and interior ministries, which control the military
and the police, and that Poland's place in the Warsaw Pact military
alliance is secure.
   Mazowiecki's representative in talks with the Communists,
Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said Wednesday night that the real negotiations
would begin after Mazowiecki's election.
   After the vote today in the Sejm, Mazowiecki shook hands with
members of the outgoing government and embraced and kissed the
leaders of the parliamentary coalition that supported him.
   Mazowiecki, succeeds Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, who asked
last week to be relieved of the task of trying to form a
Communist-led ``grand coalition'' government.
   The Sejm accepted Gen. Kiszczak's resignation without objection
today as it began its session, and warmly applauded him for his
failed attempt to assemble a Cabinet.
   Before the vote, Mazowiecki said he hopes to create a government
``of all Poles.''
   ``I want to form a government capable of acting for the good of
society, the nation and the state. It will be a government of a
coalition for a thorough reform of the state,'' Mazowiecki said in a
speech to the Sejm.
   ``The principle of struggle ... must be replaced with the
principle of partnership. We will not pass from a totalitarian
system to a democratic one in any other way.''
   ``One has to restore to Poland the mechanism of normal political
life,'' said the 62-year-old adviser to Walesa, trained as a lawyer
who has close ties to the country's powerful Roman Catholic Church.
Until last week, he was editor of Solidarity's union weekly,
Tygodnik Solidarnosc.
   ``The monopoly of one party is being broken, a monopoly contrary
to the will of the nation and interests of the country,''said
Solidarity parliamentary leader Bronislaw Geremek.
   Marian Orzechowski, leader of the Communist caucus, said the
party welcomed Mazowiecki's candidacy and said he hoped Mazowiecki
would keep promises to seek a ``wide coalition'' government that
would include Communists.

   Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose, baseball's
all-time hit leader and holder of 19 major-league records, was
banned for life today for betting on his own team _ a charge he
continued to deny.
   Under the rules of baseball, Rose can appeal for reinstatement
after one year, but baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti said,
``There is absolutely no deal for reinstatement. That is exactly
what we did not agree to in terms of fixed number of years.''
   The suspension today ended six months of allegations involving
one of the greatest players in the history of the game.
   ``In the absence of a hearing and in absence of evidence to the
contrary ... yes, I have concluded that he bet on baseball,''
Giamatti said today at a news conference announcing the suspension,
which is effective immediately.
   Asked directly if he concluded that Rose bet on his own team,
Giamatti said, ``Yes.''
   At a news conference in Cincinnati, Rose continued to deny the
charges against him. ``Despite what the commissioner said today, I
didn't bet on baseball,'' he said.
   But he admitted that he bet on other sports. ``I made some
mistakes and I'm being punished for mistakes,'' he said.
   ``As you can imagine, this is a very sad day,'' Rose said. ``I've
been in baseball three decades and to think I'm gonna be out of
baseball for a very short period of time hurts.''
   He called the settlement fair and said he regretted only ``that I
won't have the opportunity to tell my side of the story.'' Rose also
agreed to drop his federal lawsuit against Giamatti.
   The agreement announced in a statement from the commissioner's
office said that Rose ``neither denies nor admits that he bet on any
major league baseball game'' but Rose ``acknowledges that the
commissioner has a factual basis to impose the penalty provided.''
   ``The banishment for life of Pete Rose from baseball is the sad
end of a sorry episode,'' Giamatti said in the statement. ``One of
the game's greatest players has engaged in a variety of acts which
have stained the game and he must now live with the consequences of
those acts.
   ``There had not been such grave allegations since the time of
Landis,'' the statement said in a reference to Kenesaw Mountain
Landis, the commissioner who suspended for life the Chicago White
Sox players involved in the Black Sox scandal after the 1919 World
Series.
   There was no mention in the agreement, which was signed Wednesday
by Giamatti and Rose, that the manager would undergo counseling for
gambling. There was also no mention of whether the suspension would
keep Rose from being inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame.
   Giamatti said of counseling or gambling rehabilitation: ``We have
not required it. It seems to be entirely in Mr. Rose's hands.''
   Rose said he didn't consider it necessary because ``I don't think
I have a gambling problem at all.''
   Rose became the 15th person banned for life in baseball history
and the first since 1943. No one banned for life ever has been
reinstated.
   Rose agreed to a stipulation dismissing his lawsuit against
Giamatti in federal court in Ohio.
   Rose headed off suspension by suing Giamatti in state court in
Cincinnati on June 19, claiming the first-year commissioner had
prejudged the case. Six days later a judge blocked Giamatti from
holding a hearing on the gambling allegations.
   John Dowd, a special investigator, gave Giamatti a 225-page
report on May 9 outlining the evidence on Rose's gambling. It
included telephone and bank records, betting sheets allegedly in his
handwriting and the testimony of Paul Janszen and Ronald Peters,
former associates of Rose who have been convicted of federal
felonies.
   Several sources said Rose's legal team felt a need to settle the
case after U.S. District Judge John D. Holschuh ruled July 31 in
Columbus, Ohio, that the federal courts had jurisdiction rather than
the state judge. Rose faced a federal court hearing Monday on his
challenge to Giamatti.
   Rose, 48, denied having bet on baseball when he was first
summoned on gambling charges by then-Commissioner Peter Ueberroth on
Feb. 20. Three days later, baseball hired Dowd and began the
investigation, which cost about $1 million.
   Over the months, the charges multiplied. Janszen said Rose had an
associate, Tommy Gioiosa, claim the winnings from a $47,646
pari-mutuel ticket at a horse-racing track in 1987, and that Gioiosa
gave the money back to Rose.
   Gioiosa has been indicted for his alleged participation, and jury
selection in his trial was scheduled to begin today in Cincinnati.
Rose, who denied involvement, is under investigation by a federal
grand jury in Cincinnati for this and other income tax matters.
   Before the investigation, Rose was a baseball idol. In a 24-year
career, he set records for hits (4,256), games (3,562), at-bats
(14,053) and singles (3,215), among others. He was the National
League's rookie of the year in 1963, the league's Most Valuable
Player in 1973 and the World Series MVP in 1975. He won National
League batting titles in 1968, 1969 and 1973.
   Rose played in his hometown of Cincinnati for the first 16 years
of his career, then played for Philadelphia from 1979 through 1983.
He began 1984 with Montreal, returning triumphantly to Cincinnati as
player-manager on Aug. 16.
   Rose left the team this week under Coach Tommy Helms as his wife,
Carol, gave birth Tuesday to their second child.

   The overall reduction resulted from significant decreases in
prices for reinforcing steel, structural concrete, structural steel

   A passenger train rammed into a

injuring 19 people, officials said.
   The accident occurred about 200 yards from the train station in
the town of Ober-Ramstadt, a Darmstadt suburb.
   Five of the freight train's 16 cars were jolted off the tracks,
and several cars of both trains were damaged, a police statement
said.
   None of the 19 people injured were seriously hurt, police said.
   The passenger train had slowed down just before the crash as it
approached the Ober-Ramstadt station, police said.
   A track-switching error apparently caused the accident, the
police statement said.

<HEAD>Civic Leaders Try To Mobilize Residents Against Rampaging Gangs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civic leaders in South Africa's
largest black township are trying to mobilize a grassroots
anti-crime campaign, saying police have responded halfheartedly to a
surge in murders and gang-rapes.
   Soweto, home to about 2.5 million blacks on the outskirts of
Johannesburg, has had a high crime rate for years. But a sense of
crisis has developed in recent weeks because of a wave of brazen
crimes by gangs of young men known as the ``Jack Rollers.''
   The gangs, which take their name from the lyrics of a popular
song, cruise Soweto's streets in their cars, robbing other motorists
and abducting women.
   A boyfriend of one rape victim was murdered a few days ago, and
newspapers have reported incidents where teen-age girls were
abducted at gunpoint from their classrooms while teachers looked on
helplessly.
   Last weekend, the South African Council of Churches, best known
for its anti-apartheid activism, sponsored a conference at a Soweto
community center to discuss ways of combatting crime.
   The conference took place during a 48-hour span in which 24
murders, 13 rapes and 55 robberies were reported in Soweto.
   Participants at the conference resolved to establish youth
centers, convey warnings to gang leaders, and revive neighborhood
``street committees'' that proliferated in 1984-86 before police
broke them up.
   The government depicted the street committees as vigilante groups
led by radicals, but proponents said the committees helped reduce
crime as part of an effort to mobilize anti-apartheid activity on a
local level.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, secretary-general of the church council,
said the surge of gang activity ``is clearly a result of the
breakdown of community structures by state repression ... and the
inherent inability and apparent reluctance of the state to deal with
the situation.''
   Other activists say the problem stems partly from restrictions on
black high school enrollment. They say many youths who were refused
readmission to school in January after failing examinations have
turned to crime out of frustration.
   A police spokesman, Maj. Noel Hartwell, said efforts to arrest
the gangsters have been hampered by lack of public cooperation.
   ``We cannot act on theories,'' he said. ``People must come
forward and report these things.''
   But Dr. Nthato Motlana, a prominent Soweto civic leader, said at
the weekend conference that the community mistrusts police officers
and question their priorities.
   ``When called to attend to a rape incident, for instance, they
say there are no vans,'' Motlana said. ``But when people are said to
be terrorists, 10 vans will rush to the scene immediately.''
   Police are not the only scapegoats. The National Institute for
Crime and Prevention, a private crime prevention organization, says
Soweto's problems stem not only from inadequate police protection
but also from unemployment, poverty, drug and alcohol abuse, and a
breakdown of family life.
   The country's largest daily newspaper, The Star of Johannesburg,
this week endorsed the call for a revival of street committees,
saying this would be ``an immediate practical step'' to combat crime.
   But The Star's editorial said crime would persist as long as
Sowetans remained impoverished and disenfranchised.
   ``Ultimately, a lasting solution must be sought in political
change,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today lauded the
election by Poland's parliament of Solidarity activist Tadeusz
Mazowiecki as the East bloc's first non-Communist prime minister.
   ``We wish him well, of course,'' the president told reporters as
he visited a fellow vacationer, South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, on a motor yacht tied up at a dock in Kennebunkport.
``It's a fascinating period in eastern Europe.''
   Bush said the White House had sent a formal message
congratulating Mazowiecki on his election today by the Sejm, the
lower house of Poland's National Assembly.
   In a written statement later, the president promised ``our strong
support as (Mazowiecki) seeks to lead his country toward economic
recovery and democratic change.''
   ``I also salute President (Wojciech) Jaruzelski for his political
wisdom in endorsing a government reflecting the genuine will of the
Polish people and Solidarity, under the leadership of Lech Walesa,
for its constructive role in helping bring about a new beginning in
Poland,'' Bush's statement added.
   Late this morning, Bush greeted two overnight house guests,
Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter and his wife, Anne Marie Vessel
Schlueter, and returned to the subject of dramatic changes in Poland
and elsewhere in the Soviet bloc.
   ``The prime minister would agree with me that there are
fascinating changes taking place in Europe, changes he might not
have predicted when he became prime minister, changes so fast I
couldn't have predicted them just seven months ago when I became
president,'' Bush said in brief remarks.
   Schlueter added that ``you are seeing right now very positive and
exciting international developments.''
   Bush said his talks with Schlueter, whom he has known since both
were diplomats at the United Nations in the 1970s, would include
drug trafficking. Schlueter said, ``We shall also find time to
discuss politics. We can't avoid that.''
   The president on Wednesday praised Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's involvement in Poland's political changes as a positive
step toward establishing a new coalition government.
   Bush, speaking at a news conference on the lawn of his oceanside
vacation home, lauded Gorbachev for urging Polish Communist
officials to be more cooperative with Solidarity leaders.
   Bush was asked if he thought the Soviets were playing a helpful
role in Poland with Gorbachev's 40-minute phone call Tuesday to
Soviet Communist Party leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski.
   After Gorbachev's intervention, Polish communist leaders backed
away from some demands and announced they would be willing to enter
a partnership with the Solidarity-led government.
   ``There will be bumps in the road as these countries move toward
more democracy. There's no question about that,'' Bush said. ``But I
felt that the statement I saw attributed to Mr. Gorbachev was very
positive in this regard _ very.''
   Bush was asked whether he'd consider inviting Gorbachev to
Kennebunkport.
   ``Well, he'd be welcome,'' the president said. Bush added that
the Soviet leader would like the seaside town, declaring ``everybody
likes it.''
   However, a question on what he considered a fair price for a
pound of lobster stumped him. ``I don't know. Can't give it to you.''
   In other comments, Bush said:
   _Talks between U.S. and Colombian officials will soon get under
way in Washington on what U.S. aid the South American nation might
need to help fight drug cartels. The administration has offered a
wide array of non-military assistance.
   _France is within its rights in keeping warships off Lebanon
standing by for a possible evacuation of French nationals. ``I am
not about to criticize the French for what they are doing,'' the
president said.
   _His wife, Barbara, is ``doing just fine'' on a new prescription
medicine to help alleviate some double-vision that is a side effect
from a thyroid imbalance diagnosed last winter.
   _He's having a ``total vacation'' even though ``the fishing has
been lousy'' and he's being followed around the golf course by an
army of reporters, photographers and television crew. ``A modest
kind of shy guy like me, I like to play golf without a lot of people
watching,'' he said.

   A three-story scaffold that collapsed at what
is said to be the first U.S. apartment building dragged down two
balconies, but overall damage to the 138-year-old structure was
minimal, authorities said.
   No one was hurt, but authorities had feared the collapse might
have damaged the Pontalba Apartments in Jackson Square, one of the
city's most photographed landmarks.
   Manuel Weber, a maintenance director for the Louisiana State
Museum, described the damage as minimal. He and other state
officials met today to discuss the damage, while workers began
rebuilding the scaffold.
   The three-story, state-owned building was completed in 1851 and,
with a companion building on the opposite side of Jackson Square,
was undergoing a $10 million renovation to replace the brick.
   When the scaffold collapsed onto Jackson Square, it brought down
parts of the building as well, witnesses said.
   ``I was facing the Cabildo and there was a crack and you could
begin to hear beams crack and then it was like slow motion, it just
fell,'' said Doug Hardwick, who was eating with friends at a nearby
restaurant. ``Ten seconds, maybe 15 and then it was down.''
   Most of the damage was to a 40- to 50-foot section of scaffolding
which stood three stories high. Emergency crews who rushed to the
scene roped off the area and kept spectators away.
   It was the second Jackson Square accident within 16 months. In
May 1988, fire destroyed the top floor of the nearby Cabildo, where
the Louisiana Purchase territories were transferred from France to
the United States.
   Wednesday's collapse occurred at the Lower Pontalba Apartments
which, with the Upper Pontalba on the west side of Jackson Square,
were built for $300,000 in the 1850s by Micaela Leonard Almonaster.
They are designated as national historic landmarks.

   U.S. officials scrambled today to determine how
to react to a rash of bombings in Colombia by drug traffickers who
declared war on their government in retaliation for a crackdown on
the drug trade.
   ``Everyone's rushing around'' trying to figure out how to
respond, said a State Department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   President Bush said he had ``no real comment'' on the situation
in Colombia.
   ``There will be meetings with the proper Colombian officials in
the not so many hours,'' Bush said at the summer White House in
Kennebunkport, Maine, as he prepared to meet the visiting prime
minister of Denmark.
   The situation concerning the one man in Colombian custody whom
the United States wants to extradite _ accused money-launderer
Eduardo Martinez Romero _ was unclear.
   A U.S. government plane has been at the Bogota airport since last
weekend and could be used to transport Martinez to the United States
for trial on the charges filed in Atlanta in March, according to an
administration source.
   However, the source said the extradition paperwork was still
being done and that he didn't know if Martinez could be whisked out
of Colombia.
   Bill Dempsey, a spokesman for the Marshals Service that
customarily handles the transport of people being extradited, said
today, ``We're ready'' to move Martinez. ``We're standing by for any
order from the Department of Justice, but we have no further
instructions at this point.''
   A Defense Department source said the Pentagon had received no
immediate orders either to help evacuate U.S. personnel in Colombia
or to send them help.
   Bush had said Wednesday that U.S. troops would not be dispatched
because Colombian President Virgilio Barco specifically had rejected
that option.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday that
U.S. diplomats in Colombia and other Latin American countries where
the cartel has staged successful terrorist attacks have been
operating on a heightened state of alert as a result of the
crackdown.
   ``I would say that our people in Colombia and in other places
where ... threat exists have always been on a high state of
readiness or care in their security procedures. ... That
continues,'' he said.
   Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Frank Shults said today
there were no immediate plans to evacuate the two dozen DEA agents
stationed in Colombia nor their families. In the past, agents have
been removed from areas of other countries, including Mexico and
Peru, when tensions increased.
   ``However, there is a heightened sense of the need for security
in Colombia based on actions down there today,'' Shults said. ``The
Department of State is the primary agency responsible for the
security of American personnel overseas, and we will be meeting with
State Department officials to assess this situation.''
   In Colombia today, drug traffickers bombed the headquarters of
two political parties _ killing one person _ and set fire to two
politicians' homes in Medellin, the base for the world's biggest
cocaine cartel. In addition, officials said they defused powerful
bombs found in suitcases left at the Medellin offices of two
national radio networks.
   At one of the stations, the bombers left behind a communique
dated Wednesday and signed by ``The Extraditables,'' a group known
to carry out bloody acts for the Medellin drug cartel.
   ``We declare total and absolute war on the government, on the
industrial and political oligarchy, on the journalists that have
attacked and ravaged us, on the judges that have sold out to the
government, on the extraditing magistrates, on the presidents of the
unions and all those who who persecuted and attacked us,'' it said.
   ``We won't respect the families of those who have not respected
our families. ... We will burn and destroy the industries, the
properties and the mansions of the oligarchies,'' it said.
   Colombian Justice Minister Monica de Greiff had been scheduled to
fly to Washington to discuss procedures for extraditing those drug
traffickers wanted in the United States. However, it was unclear
when, or even if, she would make that trip in light of the violence
in her country, said an administration source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Thus far, none of the top leadership of the Medellin and Cali
cartels has been arrested. Martinez is considered one of the major
finanial people for Medellin, but not the chief of its
money-laundering operation.
   Drug traffickers' death squads have hit hard in Colombia and
neighboring Venezuela, but FBI spokesman Mike Kortan said, ``We have
not attributed any terrorist act to them in the United States.''
   Meanwhile, Ms. de Greiff was quoted in The Washington Post today
as saying that if U.S. financial aid is to have any impact on her
country's drug war, it should come as soon as possible and without
any strings attached. She said her country had not received any of
$5 million in U.S. aid announced in April because of wrangling over
how the money is to be spent.
   The Justice Department announced that Colombia will be offered a
$2 million program to help protect its judges and others threatened
by terrorist attacks. The agreement was signed Wednesday.
   At the State Department, Boucher said there would be other
meetings this week with senior Colombian officials, but he declined
to say when, where or who would be involved. ``We're trying to avoid
too much focus on specific meetings and individuals because of the
security situation,'' he said.
   The joint effort between the United States and Colombia began
when Barco imposed a state of siege after Friday's assassination of
Luis Carlos Galan, a leading presidential candidate and outspoken
foe of drug traffickers.
   The emergency measures have resulted in the arrests of some
11,000 people and allowed the immediate resumption of extraditions
to the United States. The Colombian Supreme Court, under attack from
drug traffickers, threw out the extradition law in 1987.
   The Justice Department this week issued its ``Most Wanted'' list
of 12 alleged drug cartel leaders, but none has been arrested.
   U.S. officials say the Medellin cartel supplies an estimated 80
percent of the cocaine sold illegally in the United States.

<TEXT>
   America's elderly will live increasingly alone
and with greater health limitations in the 21st century, researchers
say in a report highlighting the need for alternative services to
help older people avoid nursing homes.
   The private Urban Institute, in a study projecting the
characteristics of older Americans into the next century, said at
least 30 million elderly people are expected to be living alone in
2030, compared with 8.4 million in 1984.
   The number of elderly without a ``significant caregiver'' is
growing because of fewer marriages, fewer children and more
divorces, the report said.
   And if current rates of disability persist, the number of elderly
requiring institutional care will more than triple, from 1.3 million
in 1984 to 5.3 million in 2030, it said.
   ``The expectation is that there will be a surge in the demand for
supportive services that will allow the elderly to live in their
communities for a longer period of time,'' the report said.
   ``Aside from the sheer increase in the number of elderly persons,
a much larger proportion of the elderly is likely to be living alone
and a larger proportion is likely to have some level of health
dependency,'' it said.
   The research team, led by Sheila R. Zedlewski, called for more
research to prevent disability, better services such as home care,
more housing modification programs, and a revised financing system
to make proper care more affordable.
   ``While an increase in the need for nursing home care is
inevitable, the increase could be reduced if successful policies
aimed at reducing disability rates among the elderly are adopted,''
the report said.
   ``Further reductions in institutionalization rates could be made
if formal in-home services or alternative care arrangements were
more broadly available to the elderly,'' it said.
   The study, ``The Needs of the Elderly in the 21st Century,'' said
more health-care dollars should be devoted to research that could
prevent or postpone disabling diseases of aging. Of $145 billion
spent on health care for the elderly in the United States in 1988,
less than half of 1 percent was invested in research, it said.
   The report also said the patchwork of federal, state and private
programs to help the elderly often makes it difficult for older
people to qualify for the help they need, resulting in inappropriate
institutionalization.
   ``It may sadly and ironically be the case that entry into a
nursing home may be the `solution' to what is basically a housing
rather than a health problem,'' it said. ``Similarly, entering a
nursing home may emerge as a `solution' to the elderly person's
inability to manage a household.''
   The researchers said that while social services such as
home-delivered meals, homemaker assistance, visiting nurses and
adult day care can delay or prevent institutionalization, most are
not covered either by the government or private insurance.
   These services should be coordinated with housing programs that
allow for modifications such as ramps, grab bars and special kitchen
hardware to help older people function in their homes, the report
said.

<TEXT>
   In a borrowed office, beside a watercolor
no one bothered to hang, Nick Daniloff is engaged in international
diplomacy.
   Behind the scenes in government is an unusual spot for the former
U.S. News and World Report correspondent, who gained notoriety three
years ago after being imprisoned on trumped-up espionage charges.
   But now he's Vermont's man on the Soviet Union, spending his
summer months arranging the visits of a delegation of people from
Karelia, the Soviet province that Gov. Madeleine Kunin hopes will
officially become Vermont's sister state.
   ``I suppose some people might look on it as being ironic,''
Daniloff said. ``But it's for a good purpose and that's what
counts.''
   Daniloff insists he never was a spy, and that his imprisonment
followed the FBI's arrest of Gennadiy Fedorovich Zakharov. The
Soviet employee of the United Nations allegedly sought to obtain
classified information of the U.S. government from an FBI informant
at a New York City subway station.
   But neither he nor state officials are concerned that the Soviets
may be unnerved when they hear Daniloff is on the telephone, helping
arrange for the exchange of officials from Karelia.
   ``I have a gripe with the KGB, but I don't have a gripe with the
Soviet Union,'' he said in an interview this week.
   ``My understanding is that the folks in Karelia sort of shrugged
their shoulders and went on about their business. I understand there
was one official in the Soviet Embassy in Washington who raised his
eyebrows and then no more was said about it.''
   Following the 1985 summit between former president Ronald Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, personal contacts between
individuals in the superpowers were given official sanction. States
like Vermont, Alaska and Iowa have capitalized on the relaxation of
relations.
   Several independent groups in Vermont have organized exchanges of
singing students, dairy farmers and journalists. But the Karelians
are coming at the invitation of Kunin, who visited the province last
year.
   Kunin said she sought Daniloff's advice before going to the
Soviet Union. To fulfill a promise, she plucked a flower from a
bouquet at the American ambassador's residence in Moscow and placed
the carnation at the grave Daniloff's great great grandfather in a
nearby cemetery.
   When planning the Karelians' visit to Vermont, state officials
again sought Daniloff, who settled in Vermont after his Soviet
imprisonment to write a book linking his great great grandfather's
experience of imprisonment with his own. He has a home in Andover.
   ``Some people are just good for information but with Nick, you
really get understanding,'' Kunin's former chief of staff Elizabeth
Bankowski said.
   Daniloff has traveled around Vermont this summer, speaking with
those who might be interested in talking to the Soviets during the
visit, which begins Labor Day.
   The Karelians are expected to visit a Guilford dairy farmer who
has already sent a prized Holstein to the Soviet Union as a goodwill
measure.
   Daniloff also is hopeful future educational exchanges and
business deals can be arranged.
   ``All of these things are built brick by brick,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Napa Valley Wine Train won approval from
the state Public Utilities Commission to carry passengers through
the famed wine valley, but people can't get off to visit wineries.
   The unanimous PUC decision Wednesday followed a settlement worked
out during months of negotiations among the railroad, the PUC and a
coalition that opposed the train.
   Service begins Sept. 16 and tickets will cost $25 round trip,
Train President Jack McCormack said.
   The railroad's only right-of-way is on 21.3 miles of tracks
between Napa and St. Helena. Operators agreed to submit to an
environmental impact report; run no more than 15 round trips a week
nor more than three a day; and insist that passengers remain on the
train for the entire three-hour excursion.
   Wine Train operators eventually hope to allow passengers to
debark to visit wineries.
   The coalition against the train _ including virtually the
valley's entire governmental, winery and grower establishment _ has
alleged the operation would be noisy and further disrupt life in a
valley already crowded with 2 million tourists a year.

<HEAD>Minorities Seen Gaining in House From 1990s Redistricting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Minorities stand a good chance of gaining seats
in the House after congressional district lines are redrawn based on
results of the 1990 census, a demographic expert said Thursday.
   William O'Hare, director of policy studies at the Population
Reference Bureau, also predicted that ``there is going to be a
mountain of litigation'' following the census over issues such as
adjustments for undercounted minorities, whether or not to exclude
illegal aliens and inclusion of military personnel overseas in the
count used for reapportionment.
   ``We think that the redistricting in the 1990s offers a lot of
opportunities and a few potential pitfalls,'' O'Hare told a news
conference. ``Clearly, there's room for more election of
minorities.''
   In the 1991-92 reapportionment, O'Hare said, ``the states that
are likely to gain the most congressional seats _ for example,
California, Texas, Florida _ all have large minority populations.''
   He said the country's Hispanic population was expected to show a
particularly strong gain, from about 14.5 million in 1980 up to a
projected 22 million in the 1990 census _ with most of the increase
concentrated in sunbelt states.
   Asked what net gain of minority members he expects there will be
in the House, O'Hare said: ``Certainly half a dozen to 10 is not
unreasonable. ... I would say that's optimistic, but not
outlandishly optimistic.''
   The 435-seat House now has 36 minority members _ 22 blacks, nine
Hispanics, four Asian-Americans and one American Indian.
   He said that currently blacks make up about 12 percent of the
U.S. population but have only 1.5 percent of elected officials,
while Hispanics comprise 8 percent of the population but are less
than 2 percent of elected officials across the country.
   O'Hare released cpies of a new Population Reference Bureau
report, ``Redistricting in the 1990s: A Guide for Minority Groups,''
that was funded by the Ford Foundation and includes chapters written
by eight experts in minority demographics and politics.
   The Washington-based Population Reference Bureau describes itself
as a private, non-partisan organization which aims to increase
public awareness and understanding of population issues.

   A minor earthquake shook sections of southern
Massachusetts along the Connecticut and Rhode Island border about
noon Thursday, but there were no early reports of any damages or
injuries.
   ``No one's called about damage, but everyone in the town felt
it,'' said New Bedford Police Cadet Henry Turgeon.
   A seismologist at Boston College's Weston Observatory in Waltham,
Richard Spielman, said initial indications were that the temblor
rated about a 2.4 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable
damage, 6 severe damage.

   More than 300,000 people moved to the nation's
second-largest city during the first eight years of this decade,
putting its population at almost 3.3 million, according to a study.
   The city Planning Department study, released Wednesday, said the

percent to 1,303,210 during that time, meaning the average number of

   A 9-foot-diameter tree, believed to be the
world's tallest Ponderosa pine, has been cut down in a central Idaho
forest, producing a 112-foot log.
   The pine, which died three years ago, was more than 500 years old.
   Sections of the trunk, with historical dates marked on its growth
rings, will go to parks in Boise, Donnelly and Pocatello, Idaho, and
a botanical garden in Dortmund, West Germany.

   East German leader Erich Honecker, who turns 77 on
Friday, is improving after a gallstone operation, the Foreign
Ministry said Thursday.
   Honecker was ``continuing on the road to recovery'' following
last week's operation, a ministry official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not
disclose other details, such as whether Honecker is still
hospitalized.
   The official East German news agency ADN reported Monday that
Honecker had undergone surgery last week to remove gallstones.
   Honecker was also hospitalized last month for problems related to
gallstones. That illness forced him to leave the Warsaw Pact summit
in Bucharest on July 8, before its conclusion.
   Honecker appeared in public early last week for the first time in
more than a month, looking relatively fit. His absence had fueled
rumors that he was in poor health.

<TEXT>
   Law enforcement officers armed with machetes
began harvesting thousands of wild marijuana plants today in fields
in central and southeastern Oklahoma.
   Gov. Henry Bellmon, who has pushed state-coordinated efforts at
eradicating marijuana, briefly joined members of the Oklahoma
Highway Patrol tactical team and the Caddo and Canadian county
sheriff's departments in the fields near Hinton before flying to
Hugo where another eradication program was under way.
   About 180,000 wild marijuana plants were being cut, hauled to a
trench, doused with diesel fuel and burned by the patrol and
deputies. The plants ranged in height from 3 feet to over 16 feet.
   Scott Rowland, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs, said agents from the OBNDD and members of the
Oklahoma National Guard will be in southeastern Oklahoma through
Sunday cutting down marijuana from cultivated fields in that region.
   Rowland estimated 3,000 plants would be cut down and burned
today. Members of the tactical team whacked down plants, loaded them
onto a front-loader and took them into a cleared field to be burned.
   The plot was spotted from the air several days ago, and Caddo
County Sheriff Butch Hamilton called for help in eradicating it.
   At the site along the Canadian-Caddo county line, Bellmon was
asked whether the fight was a losing battle since marijuana grew
wild and whether it might not be better to just overlook it.
   ``Marijuana does grow wild, but it can be controlled,'' Bellmon
said. ``I am not willing to say we can't win the war on drugs.''

<TEXT>
   Two men pleaded innocent today to charges they
conspired to sell sophisticated computer equipment to the Soviet
Union in violation of U.S. export rules.
   U.S. Magistrate Philip K. Sweigert set trial for Oct. 16 for
David Whyte of Mississauga, Ontario, and John Townsend, a British
citizen who had been living in New Castle, Australia.
   The pair are charged with three other men and two companies in a
scheme in which they allegedly conspired to export U.S.-made
computer equipment without a Commerce Department export license.
   The Digital Equipment Corp. VAX 8700 super minicomputer that
federal agents say was designated for export can be used to design
nuclear weapons, submarines and missile and radar tracking systems.
None of the computer equipment reached the Soviet Union.
   A federal grand jury handed down up 12-count indictment in the
case on Aug. 17.
   Townsend and Whyte are both charged with one count of conspiracy
to defraud the United States, one count of conspiracy to violate
Export Administration regulations and one count of money laundering.
   Whyte also is charged with one count of attempted export of
computer goods. Townsend faces two counts of attempted export of
computer goods to a controlled country and six counts of making
false statements by falsifying shipper's export declarations.
   The men remained in custody without bail.
   Whyte, Townsend and Shiv Mohan of New Delhi were arrested July 21
in Buffalo, N.Y., as they met with Robert Casperson, the president
of a Kirkland computer firm, C-Tek, allegedly to discuss plans to
divert $900,000 in computer equipment through Canada to the Soviet
Union.
   Casperson was cooperating with federal agents, but he and Mohan
also are charged in the indictment, as is Sidhartha Bose, whose
residence was not immediately available.

<TEXT>
   Sixty years after Louise Thaden won the
first Women's Air Derby, her 1929 blue and gold Travel Air D4000 is
in the air again, retracing the derby's route to honor women pilots.
   The biplane roared in for a landing Wednesday night at Beech
Aircraft Corp.
   Navy Capt. William Yarbrough promised Thaden 15 years ago that he
would find and restore the plane. She died in 1979, but he kept his
promise.
   Yarbrough found what was left of the plane seven years ago in a
shed on an Arizona ranch.
   ``It was just in parts,'' he said. ``You could bring it home in a
station wagon.''
   When the plane was rebuilt, he asked Airborne Express pilot Susan
Dusenbury to retrace the derby's route on the 60th anniversary.
   ``She's got the same spit, polish, drive and twinkle in her eye
as Louise did,'' Yarbrough said. ``And, her middle name is Louise.''
   Thaden had piloted the biplane, originally built in Wichita in
what is now a Beech plant, from Santa Monica, Calif., to Cleveland.
She won the leg of the race from Tulsa, Okla., to Wichita and the
nine-day event over other female fliers who included Amelia Earhart
and Pancho Barnes.
   The First Women's Air Derby ushered women into the aviation age
and fueled young girls' dreams of flying. Twenty pilots began the
race, 15 finished, and one died.
   Ms. Dusenbury normally flies a DC-9 at 35,000 feet. On this trip
she is averaging 120 mph at 2,000 to 3,000 feet.
   ``It's sort of like being a tourist over the entire country,''
she said. ``I was flattered to honor Louise Thaden and women in
aviation.''
   The silver cross Thaden wore during the race dangles from a chain
around Ms. Dusenbury's neck. She also has Thaden's aviator's scarf.
   Ms. Dusenbury will stop in Kansas City, Mo., and East St. Louis,
Ill., before arriving in Cleveland on Saturday. Yarbrough is
following by car.

<TEXT>
   The minister who now heads the church that
Jim Bakker founded as the cornerstone of his PTL empire said there
was no irony intended in the parable he chose as the topic for his
midweek sermon.
   The Rev. Sam Johnson chose the parable that says it is easier for
a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to
get into heaven.
   Bakker, a Bible school classmate and Johnson's former boss, goes
on trial Monday on charges of fraud and conspiracy. Prosecutors say
he and other PTL executives diverted $4 million given to the
ministry to support luxurious lifestyles.
   ``What Jesus tells us in this parable is that it's not the amount
of work that's done, but the attitude in which the work is done
that's important,'' Johnson told about 150 worshipers Wednesday
night at Heritage Church in a sermon before the telecast of his
cable evangelical show.
   When Johnson was asked whether he had Bakker in mind, he replied,
``I did not choose that parable tonight because of the timing. But
the timing sometimes is of God.''
   Bakker built Heritage Church as part of Heritage USA, a
PTL-managed enterprise that grew over the course of a decade into a
2,300-acre Christian resort, broadcasting complex and theme park.
But Bakker was forced to leave PTL ministries in 1987 after a sexual
scandal, and PTL is now in bankruptcy court. Heritage USA and other
PTL assets have been bought by a Toronto businessman.
   Heritage Church and its parent Heritage Ministries, which runs
the daily cable program shown on the Inspirational Network, were
severed from PTL in bankruptcy proceedings last year.
   Johnson and Bakker attended Bible school together in Minneapolis
30 years ago, and Johnson later worked at PTL as an executive
responsible for world missions. But Johnson quit in a dispute with
Bakker over funding for the mission programs. He returned to
Heritage Church after Bakker resigned from PTL.
   In June, Johnson and his congregation left the grounds of
Heritage USA for a new church on Interstate 77 in a Charlotte
neighborhood of small, older homes. The new facility comprises three
cast concrete buildings.
   On Wednesday night, the sanctuary smelled of the new carpet that
had been installed on the platform. A piano and small combo provided
music and a wall with recessed blue arches provided a backdrop for
TV cameras.
   Thirty minutes after the prayer service ended, the soft lights
that lit the Heritage Church sanctuary were engulfed by bright TV
spotlights for the broadcast of ``The Old-Time Camp Meeting Hour,''
a nightly one-hour show sent to cable systems around the country.
   The congregation, including many who had been bused 10 miles from
Heritage USA, gathered in the center section of the sanctuary, a
former gymnasium, to be part of the show.
   Wednesday night's guest speaker was the Rev. Charles Crank, the
District Superintendent of Indiana for the Assemblies of God, the
denomination that defrocked Bakker in March 1987. Viewers got only
part of his 50-minute sermon because an electrical storm knocked the
ministry off the air for the first half-hour.
   Heritage Ministries normally broadcasts an hour each night, but
it bought a second hour of satellite time Wednesday night to ask for
donations.
   Television viewers, Johnson said later, have become skeptical of
preachers crying for money over the airwaves in the wake of the many
recent evangelical scandals.
   ``But we have no alternative,'' he said.

   A judge Thursday extended a ban on distributing an
album ex-Beatle Ringo Starr recorded in 1987 but now wants kept off
the shelves.
   Starr says his drinking problem marred the album. Record producer
Chips Moman and CRS Records, based in College Park, Ga., say the
record could make $3.5 million if released while Starr is on his
current U.S. concert tour.
   Superior Court Judge Clarence Cooper, who earlier banned
distributing the album for 30 days, extended the restraining order
until Starr's lawsuit to kill the album is tried, possibly in
October.
   Starr recently underwent treatment for alcoholism and said in a
deposition filed this week that during the recording sessions in
Moman's studio in Memphis, Tenn., he and the other musicians often
drank.
   ``We would send out for wine, or there would be tequila there or
cognac or whatever, you know, anybody felt like drinking, vodka.
There was always plenty of alcohol on the premises,'' Starr said.
   Moman says he did not allow liquor in his studio.
   Starr also is unhappy he didn't play the drums on the album.

   Brigitte Bardot on Thursday denounced France's
national medical research institute for refusing to sell her 29
animals stolen from its laboratories and later recovered.
   ``Human survival is very important, but not at the price of
sacrifices and martyrdom done legally with good conscience by
researchers on animals which endure tortures worse than the SS made
men endure during the war,'' the former actress said on French radio.
   The National Institute for Health and Medical Research, in a
statement, said the offer to buy 28 monkeys and one cat was
pointless, because other animals would have to be purchased in their
place for experiments.
   Miss Bardot, who in recent years has devoted her life to animal
protection, said she was ``disappointed but not surprised.''
   The animal rights group Noah's Ark claimed responsibility for
taking the monkeys and cat from the laboratory last May. The animals
were found the following month in a home in southern France.

   Drug use by military recruits apparently dropped
by half in the first months of mandatory drug-testing of armed
forces applicants, military and health officials said Thursday.
   Subsequent testing of some 6,000 urine samples collected from
random recruits in March and April 1988 showed that 7.3 percent had
recently used marijuana, 1.8 percent had used cocaine and 0.7 were
positive for both, according to a report from the Office of the Army
Surgeon General, published in Thursday's weekly report of the
Centers for Disease Control.
   Those numbers were roughly twice the results of the first seven
months of the Defense Department's new applicant testing program. Of
more than 320,000 recruits tested from June-December 1988, 2.4
percent were positive for marijuana, 0.9 percent were positive for
cocaine and 0.3 percent were positive for both.
   The applicants who provided urine samples in the March-April
pilot study were not told they would be drug-tested, but the samples
were not personally identified and the results could not be linked
to individuals, the CDC report said.
   Positive specimens from those pilot tests were not confirmed;
data from other military drug tests indicates that 85 percent to 90
percent of the positive samples would have been confirmed on repeat
testing, the report said.
   The Defense Department has screened all applicants for military
service since June 1988, under an act of Congress. The testing
program is ``the largest non-random drug-testing program in the
United States,'' the CDC said.
   Early findings from the program were released in January. Some
defense officials said privately at the time that while the program
had blocked more than 11,000 apparent drug-using recruits in its
first seven months, it was not worth its multimillion-dollar cost.

   The Soviet Council of Ministers congratulated
Poland's new non-Communist prime minister Thursday and expressed
hope his election would not damage relations between the countries.
   Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a veteran Solidarity activist, was elected
prime minister earlier in the day by the Sejm, the lower house of
Poland's National Assembly. The historic vote made him the first
non-Communist chief of government in the East bloc.
   Within hours, the Council of Ministers, or Soviet cabinet, sent
Mazowiecki a telegram of ``friendly congratulations'' that also was
carried by the official Soviet news agency Tass.
   ``We express the certainty that the traditional relations of
friendship and all around cooperation between the Soviet Union and
Poland will continue developing in the basis of sovereign equality
and respect, mutual benefit and mutual responsibility,'' the Council
of Ministers said.
   An interview with Mazowiecki also was printed Thursday in the
Soviet government's evening newspaper, Izvestia. The new Polish
leader was quoted as saying his government would be open to all,
including the Polish Communist Party, but that the time was clearly
past ``when only one camp could form the government.''
   At a regular news briefing, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Yuri A. Gremitskikh also reacted to Mazowiecki's election with
equanimity.
   ``The Soviet side takes the decision into account and we shall
regard comrade Mazowiecki as our partner in the relations that link
our two countries,'' he said.

   Voyager 2 discovered two more moons
around Neptune today and for the first time photographed high,
bright clouds so clearly that the cloud's shadows could be seen on a
lower layer of haze.
   The two new moons bring Neptune's total to eight, including the
two moons observed from Earth _ Triton and Nereid _ and four
previously found by Voyager.
   Photographs returned from Neptune showed dramatic and puzzling
details in the clouds over the Great Dark Spot, an Earth-sized
cyclone that is Neptune's most prominent feature, said Bradford
Smith, leader of the imaging team.
   ``There's something about that dark spot,'' Smith said. ``The
clouds appear to be stationary even though the winds are moving very
strongly through this area.''
   The cloud shadows Voyager photographed came from similar high,
white, cirrus-like clouds at another spot on Neptune. ``This is the
first time Voyager has ever been able to see cloud shadows on any of
the planets we've looked at,'' Smith said.
   The positions of the shadows allowed scientists to calculate that
the high clouds were about 30 miles above the lower layer of haze,
Smith said.
   As Voyager 2 began its final approach to Neptune, it showed that
the planet's strange moon Triton is a bright pink, red and blue
marble ringed by what could be a snow-covered glacier of frozen
natural gas, scientists say.
   Scientists also received confirmation that final instructions to
control the spacecraft's cameras and sensors had been received, said
Douglas Griffith, deputy mission director.
   ``We know it's in there now and we're safe,'' he said.
   At 9 a.m. PDT today Voyager was 472,056 miles from Neptune,
caught in the grip of Neptune's powerful gravity and falling toward
the fourth-largest planet at a speed of 38,599 mph.
   At 8:56 p.m. PDT Voyager will pass 3,042 miles from Neptune's
cloud tops, closer than it has come to any other celestial object on
its 4.4 billion-mile journey from Earth.
   Researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory planned an
all-night vigil as the most detailed images begin coming back from
the spacecraft early Friday morning. It takes 4 hours and six
minutes for radio signals from the spacecraft to reach Earth.
   Two days of tracking the spacecraft showed that a difficult
course correction Monday had put Voyager ``smack dab in the middle''
of the path navigators wanted it to follow, said Norman Haynes,
Voyager project manager.
   The spacecraft, launched in 1977, will reach a speed of 61,148
mph as it sweeps around Neptune headed for a pass 23,888 miles from
Triton at 2:14 a.m. PDT Friday.
   Triton's equator is encircled with what appears to be a slightly
blue band of fresh snow or frost, probably made of frozen natural
gas, or methane, said Robert Brown of the Voyager imaging team.
   ``If you were standing there you'd see crystals of frost growing
much as you see frost growing on a window in the winter time,''
Brown said in an interview.
   ``It's going to look glacial, like a glacier with a thin layer of
snow on it,'' he said.
   The band may be white or may be slightly blue, said Bradford
Smith, head of the imaging team. ``If it is indeed blue, it's the
only thing we've seen blue on any satellite since we launched
Voyager,'' he said.
   The band borders a darker, reddish area in Triton's northern
hemisphere, which itself is still as bright as dirty snow, Brown
said. It looks dark only because the rest of the planet is so
bright, he said.
   The darker region could consist of frozen methane darkened by
bombardment with energetic subatomic particles from space,
researchers said. Much of the moon's southern hemisphere appears
pink.
   Researchers reported the first possibility of a meteorite crater
on Triton. ``I saw a circular feature,'' said Smith. ``Certainly an
impact crater is a possibility,'' he said. Confirmation will await
more detailed images, he said.
   The pictures have convinced scientists that Triton is
unobstructed by clouds.
   ``Almost certainly we're seeing the surface,'' Smith said. ``That
suggests some real excitement here Friday morning and again on
Saturday,'' when the most detailed photographs reach Earth.
   Friday morning, Vice President Dan Quayle, head of the
policy-making National Space Council, will visit the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory for a briefing on space activities. He will also meet
with reporters.
   Among Voyager's findings was the Aug. 11 discovery of what first
appeared to be a partial ring around Neptune. Scientists say
photographs indicate that it probably is a complete second ring
around Neptune.
   ``Probably it's a ring,'' said Smith. ``But it's a ring like
we've never seen before.''
   Researchers also expect to find at least two new moons near
Neptune, beyond the two previously known and the four already
discovered by Voyager, Smith said.

<HEAD>Soviet Dancer Moved From Utah; Chinese Dancers' Whereabouts unknown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A love-struck Soviet dancer seeking asylum
has left Utah for another part of the country, an immigration
official said Thursday, and the whereabouts of two Chinese dancers
remained unknown.
   The three women were among 350 dancers and musicians from 12
countries invited to peform in the annual World Folkfest festival in
Springville, about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City, Aug. 12 through
Monday.
   Chen Li, 24, and Zhe Qian, 27, both from Guizhou, Peoples
Republic of China, left their host family's home Friday and never
returned, officials said. There was speculation they may have gone
with an exchange student who is married to one of the women.
   The Soviet dancer, Svetlana Kirenko, 32, told Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials during interviews Wednesday that
she was afraid to return home after refusing Tuesday to board a
flight with other Soviet performers.
   ``She indicated a fear of returning to the Soviet Union. It was a
generalized fear, nothing specific. If she does decide to go ahead
and apply for asylum, she'd have to provide some specifics then,''
said Meryl Rogers, in charge of the local INS office.
   By expressing fear of retribution if she returns to her home in
the Donetsk region of the Ukraine north of the Black Sea, Kirenko
qualifies for political asylum consideration, he said.
   Kirenko, a member of the Ukrainian Donbass troupe that performed
last week, was escorted by a federal official from her host family's
home Tuesday while her group was preparing to go to Salt Lake
International Airport.
   After preliminary discussions with the FBI, she was turned over
to the INS late Tuesday. Rogers said she left the state for
``another part of the county'' after INS agents completed
questioning her Wednesday.
   Rogers would not specify where Kirenko had gone. He said he
understood any further INS proceedings would take place wherever
Kirenko had moved.
   Authorities have said they understood Kirenko fell in love with
Robert Retallick, 22, of Rexburg, Idaho, during Donbass' appearance
earlier this month at a folk festival in the southeastern Idaho
community.
   Retallick left Rexburg for Salt Lake City on Tuesday to be with
Kirenko, but his whereabouts were unknown Thursday. His sister,
Holly Retallick, said she had not heard from him since he left
Rexburg. ``There will be no more comments,'' she said, hanging up.
   Meanwhile, the INS had no information on the whereabouts of the
two women from the People's Republic of China. Both the FBI and
State Department referred all questions to the INS.
   The two women did not contact federal authorities before leaving
Friday. They were seen getting into a car driven by a man, whom
authorities said may be one of the women's husband _ a Chinese
exchange student in Houston.
   They later called to thank their host family for their
hospitality, and said they were safe and had left the state.

<HEAD>Former Congressman Says He May Face More Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall, who
awaits sentencing on a perjury conviction, said he expects to be
indicted again _ this time on charges of tampering with a federal
jury.
   Swindall told the Gwinnett Daily News on Wednesday that he was
offered an opportunity to enter a plea to charges that he tampered
with a jury selected last fall to hear his perjury case. He said he
refused the offer.
   ``I expect I'll be indicted on this jury-tampering matter,'' said
Swindall, a Republican from Georgia's 4th District.
   Swindall's attorney, Tom Thrash, declined to comment. U.S.
Attorney Bob Barr was out of town and could not be reached for
comment.
   Swindall was convicted in June on nine counts of lying to a
federal grand jury investigating a drug money-laundering scheme. He
is to be sentenced Monday.
   Swindall was indicted in that case last October and tried to go
to trial immediately in an effort to clear his name before the Nov.
8 election, when he faced a strong opponent.
   A jury was selected, but was never sworn in because U.S. District
Judge Robert Vining ended the proceedings due to Swindall campaign
literature that mentioned the case.
   The judge said he was disturbed that a campaign mailing reprinted
a letter from a polygraph examiner who said Swindall did not lie
when asked about his knowledge of the alleged drug money operation.
   The mailing was sent the day after Vining told Swindall, a lawyer
representing himself, that he could not mention the polygraph test
in the trial. Four of the 14 people selected as jurors and
alternates lived in Swindall's district, where the brochure was
mailed.
   Swindall ended up losing the Nov. 8 election to actor Ben Jones,
a Democrat.

<TEXT>
   Writer and artist Feliks Topolski, who painted
royalty as well as battle scenes for the British government, died
Thursday at the age of 82.
   Topolski, who lived in London, had been suffering from heart
trouble and diabetes, said his son, Daniel.
   Topolski decided to settle in Britain when he first came to
London in 1935 to cover the jubilee celebrations of King George V
for a Polish satirical newspaper.
   He was made a member of London's Royal Academy in recognition of
his work, which included the 100-foot-long painting of the
coronation of Queen Elizabeth II for Buckingham Palace and the
60-foot by 20-foot Cavalcade of the Commonwealth, painted for the
1951 Festival of Britain.
   As an official War Artist for the British government from
1940-45, Topolski painted the Battle of Britain and other scenes.
   Drawings, watercolors and oil paintings by Topolski are owned by
the British Museum, the Tate Gallery and galleries in New York,
Toronto, Tel Aviv, Melbourne and Warsaw.
   Topolski also designed theatrical sets and costumes and published
his annual personal pictorial journal, Chronicle, from 1953 to 1979.
   He was educated at the Mikolaj Rey School and the Academy of Art
in Warsaw and went to the Polish Officers' School of Artillery
Reserve.

<HEAD>Oscar-Winner Urges Young Actors `to Beat the System'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dustin Hoffman says young actors should do whatever
they must to beat the system and find work, even if it means
pestering celebrities like Dustin Hoffman.
   He praised actor Neal Foster, 23, who coaxed Hoffman into his
campaign to raise money to put on a play.
   ``If you know that no one cares and that the odds are you're not
going to work, then you have to beat the system. Now this guy's
beating the system,'' Hoffman said of Foster, speaking Wednesday
before a capacity audience at the Playhouse Theater.
   ``You have to find a way to act; he's finding a way to act.''
   ``You cannot get a job by doing what everyone else does. He
(Foster) knows that.''
   Hoffman is appearing in London through Sept. 23 in Shakespeare's
``The Merchant of Venice.''
   The Oscar-winning star is Foster's biggest catch yet in a series
of celebrity interviews to finance a staging of Anton Chekhov's
``The Sea Gull.'' Foster, a 1988 graduate of the Bristol Old Vic
theater school, wants to appear in and produce the play next April
in Birmingham, England.
   Foster approached Hoffman at the stage door of ``Merchant'' on
June 21 to enlist his help and Hoffman immediately agreed. The event
sold out the theater and contributed nearly $5,200 toward the
$23,500 needed, Foster said.
   Foster needs about $3,000 more and said he hopes to reach that
when he holds his next interview, with Jack Lemmon, on Sept. 20.
   When asked during the interview about unfulfilled ambitions,
Hoffman quoted the late English actor-knight, Sir Ralph Richardson,
who said: ``I'd like to learn a little bit more about acting before
it's too late.''

   Rep. Mickey Leland, one of nine Americans killed
en route to an Ethiopian refugee camp, was buried today in a private
service attended by family members and a few friends.
   An Air Force C-135 jet carried Leland's flag-draped coffin from
Washington to Houston's Ellington Field, where about 50 people
gathered for its arrival Wednesday.
   They watched in silence as Leland's coffin was taken off the
plane by an all-military team of pallbearers. Two women held an
abstract banner in red, green, black and gold banner that they made
in his honor. The Texas Democrat was buried today at Golden Gate
Cemetery.
   Leland's mother, Alice Rains of Houston, and his brother, Gaston,
were on the flight from Washington. Mrs. Rains clutched a folded
Ethiopian flag as she watched her son's coffin carried to a hearse.
   ``I kind of feel like he's at home,'' said Councilman Ben Reyes,
who was at the airport. ``It makes you feel a little better to have
him home.''
   All nine Americans killed Aug. 7 on the ill-fated mercy flight to
an Ethiopian refugee camp were honored earlier at a ceremony at
Andrews Air Force Base near Washington.
   Leland's coffin was the first removed from an Air Force C-141 jet
transport that had brought the bodies from Addis Ababa to Andrews.
Three congressional aides, four foreign service officials and a New
York philanthropist were the other Americans killed in the crash.
   Seven Ethiopians also died when Leland's chartered Twin Otter
slammed into a mountainside not far from its destination.
   ``We gather to honor nine fallen heroes of peace,'' said House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. ``They reached Addis Ababa by
different roads ... but each was on a mission of peace, humanity and
compassion. In asking God's blessing on each of them, let us
dedicate ourselves to their values.''
   As the Air Force Band softly played dirges, three all-military
teams of pallbearers slowly moved the coffins from the transport
plane to nine hearses.
   ``Let us all pledge to keep alive the spirit of Congressman
Leland and those who shared his mission. May God bless them, and may
God bless America, which they represented so honorably and well,''
said Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt.
   Leland's mother stood with hands clasped at her waist through
most of the 45-minute ceremony. She dabbed tears from her eyes when
the door of the hearse bearing her son was closed.
   About 400 people, including family members of the crash victims,
25 House members and scores of congressional aides, attended the
Andrews ceremony.

<HEAD>Papers Publish Old Deng Speeches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Speeches by Deng Xiaoping were splashed across the
front pages of major Chinese newspapers Thursday as the official
media intensified their new, adulatory treatment of the aging senior
leader.
   Three different speeches by Deng _ all given decades ago _ filled
the top half of the front pages of several national newspapers.
Rarely have old speeches been reprinted and so prominently displayed.
   But Deng's prominence in the official media has grown
substantially since he ordered the military to crack down on June
3-4 on the mass pro-democracy movement in Beijing. Troops killed
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people.
   Deng, 85, has not been seen in public since June 9, when he
addressed martial law troops in Beijing. He is reported to be ill
with cancer.
   The press has quoted him regularly and released several of his
early essays. A book of reminiscences about his early career has
come out and a major movie has been made about his role in leading a
Communist uprising in 1929. The China Art Gallery displays a bronze
bust of him.
   The three speeches that were published Thursday are among 39
contained in a new volume of his selected works that was released
this week.
   The Guangming Daily, published for intellectuals, carried a
speech given in 1950, less than a year after the Communists came to
power in China.
   In it, Deng spoke to journalists about the importance of their
work, emphasizing their responsibility to educate the masses in
political ideology and carry out party policy.
   The Economic Daily and the Workers Daily published a speech Deng
made four years later to a group of party officials about the need
for the party to turn its focus from revolution to construction.
   A 1961 speech to members of the Communist Youth League, the
party's youth branch, about the league's responsibilities, was
printed in China Youth News.
   On Deng's birthday Tuesday, all major newspapers carried a 1957
Deng speech from the new collection on their front pages. In that
speech, Deng said democracy should be implemented within the party,
but he rejected Western-style democracy for China.

<HEAD>Judges' Ruling Allows Historic Subliminal Message Trial to Go Forward</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `Previously, in ...' to CORRECT that previous
rulings had not addressed subliminal messages.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ruled that a lawsuit may go to
trial to determine if any subliminal messages on a heavy metal Judas
Priest album led to a suicide pact between two Reno youths.
   Washoe District Judge Jerry Whitehead ruled Wednesday that
subliminal messages don't enjoy First Amendment rights of freedom of
speech because they are aimed at the subconscious.
   Whitehead said he found it difficult to accept that any expert
could say the suicides were triggered by alleged subliminal messages
on the British band's ``Stained Class'' album. But he said the issue
should be decided by a jury.
   ``The court concludes it must allow the public to decide these
important and unique issues after a full hearing and must not
interpose its own personal opinions,'' Whitehead said.
   Previously, in similar lawsuits filed across the country, judges
have dismissed cases after ruling that artistic messages are
protected by the First Amendment. But courts have not spoken to the
issue of subliminal messages.
   The lawsuit was filed by the families of the two youths _ one who
died immediately after shooting himself with a shotgun in December
1985 and the other who died three years later of from complications
of his injuries.
   Raymond Belknap, then 17, and James Vance, then 19, shot
themselves in a school playground after sharing a 12-pack of beer,
smoking marijuana and listening to ``Stained Class'' in Belknap's
bedroom for several hours.
   In a deposition taken before he died, Vance said the music
convinced them the answer to life was death.
   Experts hired by attorneys for the youths' families have
submitted reports claiming the subliminal message ``do it, do it''
can be heard buried in the album recorded by CBS Records in the
1970s.
   The defendants, CBS Records and Judas Priest, have strongly
denied there were any subliminal messages in the album.

<HEAD>Rushdie Poem to Appear in Literary Magazine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poem by Salman Rushdie, written shortly after the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said the novelist should die for writing
``The Satanic Verses,'' will appear next month in a British literary
magazine.
   It will be Rushdie's first published literary work since the late
Iranian spiritual leader put a price on his head Feb. 14 for ``The
Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems consider blasphemous.
   Rushdie, who has since been in hiding under police guard, writes
in the three-verse, 17-line poem that he has chosen ``not to shut
up. To sing on, in spite of attacks,'' and says he has been called
``full-of-hate, self-aggrandizing, Satan, self-loathing and shrill.''
   The poem is to appear under copyright in Granta, a literary
journal edited by Bill Buford, an American who came to Cambridge
University in 1977 as a literature student.
   Buford founded Granta as a platform for new writing in 1979, and
the issue containing Rushdie's poem celebrates the magazine's 10th
anniversary.
   The poem is called ``6 March 1989,'' which Buford said was the
date it was written, 20 days after Khomeini's ruling.
   Buford said Rushdie was among writers who contributed to the
first issue and were invited to publish new work in the anniversary
edition.
   That invitation went out before Khomeini's death sentence, and
Rushdie had been expected to contribute a prose piece, Buford said,
but instead a typewritten poem arrived with no accompanying
explanation of any sort.
   Buford, who provided a copy of the poem, said he had verified
that it was, indeed, Rushdie's work.
   ``I think it is an important, heartfelt statement of a man
feeling alone and isolated and estranged from friends, public and
audience, who is under circumstances that no writer in living memory
has had to live under,'' Buford told The Associated Press.
   ``I think it's moving and in its way quite profound,'' he said.
   Rushdie remains in hiding with his wife, novelist Marianne
Wiggins. Khomeini died in June, but the death sentence was not
lifted, and the Indian-born Moslem writer has published nothing
except a brief apology for any offense caused to Moslems, and a few
book reviews in the weekly Observer newspaper.
   Granta sells about 140,000 copies per issue. It is distributed by
Penguin, the group that published ``The Satanic Verses,'' and the
anniversary issue goes on sale Sept. 1.

   June Christy concedes she might get a little
teary-eyed when her lively brood of flaxen-haired quadruplets sets
off for kindergarten Monday.
   ``I'll try to control myself,'' she said, smiling. ``I used to
chuckle at these first-time mothers who got all weepy the first day
of school. I used to think what's the big deal? Now I understand.
   ``It's just that separation,'' she said.
   Dad Richard Christy sees it as an opportunity for Jill, Jeffrey,
Philip and Alison to meet new friends and enjoy new experiences.
   For the 5-year-old Christy youngsters, it promises to be a treat.
   There's recess, ``where you get to go out and play,'' said
Alison. Jill looks forward to meeting lots of children. Jeffrey can
find others to share his budding athletic interests. There's also
the fun of riding the bus, says Philip.
   At the suggestion of school officials, the four will be split
into pairs with different classrooms and teachers to encourage

   Once the four are in school, June Christy plans to do some kind

to a project she's had on hold for years: updating scrapbooks on her

   The Rev. Jack Blankenship left the U.S.
Navy in 1946, but the Defense Department didn't forget: It tracked
him down to return the canteen he left decades ago on a South
Pacific island beach.
   An Ohio couple found the canteen while they were touring World
War II battle sites in the New Georgia islands, near New Guinea and
Guadalcanal.
   Blankenship's name, rank, serial number and blood type were
etched into the back of the rusty canteen, which had remained inside
its metal cup.
   The finders _ Pete and Betty Medley of Shelby, Ohio _ assumed
pharmacist's mate Blankenship had been killed. They contacted Sen.
John Glenn, D-Ohio, and asked him to help locate Blankenship's next
of kin _ and, through the Defense Department, they learned he was
very much alive.
   ``We were just very thrilled that this man had lived through that
war and was still alive and well,'' Mrs. Medley said Tuesday.
   The canteen arrived in the mail this week, and Blankenship
recalled he had left it and his other gear after being shot in the
leg during a shore mission.
   Blankenship said he immediately called the Medleys after the
Defense Department called him about his canteen. When Pete Medley
answered the phone, Blankenship could hear him yell, ``Betty! It's
him!''
   Blankenship, a former pastor at Valley Baptist Church in
Longview, said he and his family feel touched and excited about
receiving the canteen. They said they are grateful to the Medleys,
whom they hope someday to meet, and to Glenn.

<TEXT>
   All but two of the 370 people
detained during a protest on the 21st anniversary of the 1968
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia have been released, a
government spokesman said Thursday.
   Two Hungarians under investigation on charges of breaching public
order for their alleged role in stirring up the anti-government
protest are the only two people still in custody, the spokesman,
Miroslav Pavel, told a news conference.
   They were identified as Tamas Deutsch and Gyoergy Kerenyi, two
activists with the Hungarian opposition youth group FIDESZ. Kerenyi
addressed a crowd chanting for freedom at the start of Monday's
protest before being grabbed by plainclothes police.
   According to state-run media, 50 foreigners were among the 370
people detained. Hundreds of helmeted riot police swarmed through
central Prague to break up the protests.
   Pavel did not say whether any of the 320 Czechoslovaks detained
would face charges or simply be fined for their participation in the
banned demonstration.
   Diplomats in Prague said eight Italians and seven Dutch residents
were released and ordered to leave the country Thursday.
   A Dutch Embassy spokesman said the Dutch were fined before being
released.
   Seven Hungarians, including five cameramen and photographers,
were released Wednesday and left for home, the official news agency
CTK reported.
   Two Austrian cameramen also were freed Wednesday after what
Austrian radio termed ``massive intervention'' from Vienna's embassy
in Prague.
   A West German TV crew and an American reporter also were briefly
detained Monday, as well as three Poles who spent two days in
detention. The identities of the remaining foreigners were not known.
   Pavel said that Czechoslovak authorities, who blamed foreign
``provocateurs'' for Monday's protest, would continue to punish
outsiders who violated national law.
   ``Czechoslovakia welcomes tourists ... but that does not free
them from the obligation to respect Czechoslovak laws,'' he said.
``Czechoslovak authorities will not permit the center of town to
become a place for all kinds of demonstrations on which cheap
political capital would be banked at our expense.''
   Czechoslovakia's entrenched Communist leadership, which came to
power after the 1968 invasion, has resisted mounting pressure at
home and from East bloc reformers to relax its monopoly on power.

   Thomas T. Demery lobbied to be appointed
secretary of Housing and Urban Development while knowing he was
under investigation for allegedly mishandling a federal housing
program, records released Thursday show.
   As assistant secretary for housing at HUD for two years, ``I have
become greatly challenged and sensitized to the public policy
questions surrounding the homeless, the availability of low-income
housing, and the difficulty the elderly and first-time homebuyers
face in finding affordable housing,'' Demery said in a form letter
to congressmen dated Dec. 7, 1988.
   The position went to former Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., and Demery
has gone into private consulting. But Demery's conduct at HUD is
being examined as part of the probe of alleged fraud, abuse and
mismanagement at the agency during the Reagan administration.
   The letter was sent to Sens. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.; Donald
Riegle, D-Mich.; Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; Rep. Carl Pursell, R-Mich.;
and Robert Teeter, then co-director of the office of President-elect
Bush.
   The letters were contained in files opened to the press Thursday
under the Freedom of Information Act.
   Demery could not immediately be reached Thursday. A woman
answering his telephone said Demery was on vacation.
   Demery is a former Michigan real estate agent and mortgage broker
who worked in Ronald Reagan's successful 1980 campaign. As assistant
housing secretary, he administered several of HUD's biggest
programs, including $225 million in moderate-rehabilitation funds
awarded annually and the massive Federal Housing Administration's
mortgage insurance program.
   The rehabilitation program has been revealed to be governed by
influence peddling while the FHA has been losing millions of dollars
annually through loan defaults and mismanagement.
   In particular, HUD's inspector general was investigating in 1988
whether Demery had misused his position to induce contractors
seeking HUD business to contribute to his pet charity, F.O.O.D. for
Africa. The inspector general concluded that Demery may have traded
on his position, but last month the Justice Department said it saw
no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.
   The inspector general's investigation began in December of 1987,
and by the autumn of 1988 it was apparent that Demery was among the
targets of the probe.
   In his initial interview with investigators in May, Demery was
asked whether he steered HUD business to a former employee of the
department, and in October he had been interviewed again, this time
in the office of his attorney where he handed over personal bank
records.
   Much more extensive files of two other former HUD officials _
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. and his top aide, Deborah Gore Dean _
have given insights into their activities at the agency. In
contrast, the Demery files opened Thursday consisted largely of
copies of his testimony before Congress.
   But a folder headed ``Per Personnel 1986-88'' revealed a serious
case of office infighting between Demery and R. Hunter Cushing, then
deputy assistant secretary for multifamily housing programs.
   Cushing resigned Aug. 2 from the post of deputy assistant
secretary for loan programs at the Department of Commerce, a
position he assumed under the Bush administration. A few weeks
earlier he invoked his constitutional right against
self-incrimination and refused to answer questions when called
before a congressional subcommittee investigating HUD.
   There was no answer Thursday at Cushing's home telephone number.
   ``The issue remains that you've lost control of the people who
work for you, the public you serve, and the industry you oversee,''
Demery said in a 1986 letter to Cushing. ``I believe a change must
occur.''
   Demery wrote in a memo after Cushing missed a June 1988 staff
meeting:
   ``Summertime attendance conflicts due to heavy social commitments
and inconvenient flight schedules are inappropriate reasons for not
attending staff meetings. I also think your suggestions to change my
meeting time to accommodate your social life was equally
inappropriate.''

   Delays in the Soviet Mars program
following the first public scrutiny of the space program's budget
could affect U.S. plans to launch a spacecraft to Mars in 1992, a
NASA scientist said Thursday.
   A leading Soviet space official said that Soviet plans to explore
Mars and ultimately send a manned mission there are being delayed by
pressure to divert money to social programs.
   The U.S. program had been tentatively planned to mesh with the
Soviet program, with U.S. launches scheduled for 1992 and 1996 and
Soviet launches in 1994 and 1998, said John Casani, assistant
director for flight projects at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   That plan is now uncertain, because Soviet space scientists have
not yet received all the money they need for the so-called Mars '94
mission.
   ``We have got funding for instruments but not for the
spacecraft,'' said Albert Galeev, head of the Institute of Space
Research in Moscow.
   He was in Pasadena for the Second International Conference on
Solar System Exploration, being held at the California Institute of
Technology to coincide with Voyager 2's close encounter with Neptune
Thursday.
   He said he expected the remainder of the money to be approved
soon, but the delay has already forced scientists to cut back plans
for Mars '94, Galeev said.
   The mission had been planned to include a rover that could move
about the Martian surface, but because of delays in funding there is
no longer time to develop and test such a rover by 1994, he said.
   The mission had also been planned to include one or more helium
balloons designed to take measurements as they drift through the
Martian atmosphere and possibly even land to study the Martian
surface at different points.
   ``The most immediate impact on the U.S. Mars program would be if
they decide not to go ahead with the balloon experiment,'' said
Casani.
   The Mars Observer, the American Mars mission scheduled to be
launched in 1992, was designed to be able to communicate with the
balloons, he said.
   Galeev said in an interview that at the meeting of the Congress
of People's Deputies in Moscow in late May and early June, some
delegates had argued that money should be diverted from the space
and military budgets toward raising workers' salaries and pensions.
   In the end, money was taken only from the military budget, not
from the space budget, he said. Nevertheless, approval for funding
of space missions has slowed.
   ``We want to keep all the programs, but whether we will do it on
a longer scale or as we had planned, it's difficult to say now,''
Galeev said.
   ``Certainly, space is a lower priority than it was,'' he said.
``But certainly it is not as bad as it looked at the time of the
Congress of the People's Deputies.''
   ``Up until now, their program has never been subject to public
approval,'' said Casani, ``nor were trade-offs made with social
programs. With glasnost, these programs are going to have to
withstand public scrutiny.''
   The U.S. program is also changing now, Casani said, as NASA
rushes to complete a 90-day report requested by President Bush on
July 20, when he proposed that the United States send manned
missions to the moon and Mars.
   The Soviet Mars program was set back last year when two Phobos
spacecraft failed. One was given an incorrect command from Earth.
The reason for the failure of the other spacecraft is not known.

<HEAD>WARSAW: diligent people.</HEAD>

   My greatest wish is that the present coalition government could
open to Poles the possibility of lifting up the country
economically. We need efficient, economic means which will give
enterprising people a feeling of security about their activity and
let everyone find a moral and material sense of their work.
   The problem of law and rule of law is of basic importance. For 45
years the law has been treated cavalierly in Poland, subordinated to
the current political aims. And citizens did not have a sense of
freedom of conscience, that the law protects them and that it is the
same for all.
   It is necessary to introduce the rule of law, by giving every
citizen the rights accordant with international pacts, agreements
and conventions. Citizens must have a feeling of freedom, security
and co-participation.
   They can have such a feeling only in a law-abiding state, in
which every action by authorities is based on the law and through
legislation, contents and interpretation of its provisions
correspond with the social feeling of justice.
   Only law aiming at the common good may enjoy respect and social
authority. We will not form an entirely new army or police. What
matters is creating legal guarantees so that everyone, including
those inside those institutions, feels they serve society.
   Professional administration functions effectively when
appointments are based on competence and bound by loyalty to the
state, not as currently by loyalty to particular parties.
   In relations between the government and citizens, the mass media
play an irreplacable role, especially radio and television. Today
they must be pluralistic. I consider transition from a monopoly to
pluralism in this field indispensable.
   High Chamber,
   I am convinced that Poland can fulfill an important role in the
political, economic and cultural life of Europe. The country's
extremely difficult economic situation of the country does not bode
optimistically in the field of international relations. A gap is
growing in the level of civilization between Poland and societies of
highly developed countries. This increases Poles' weariness, as
expressed among other ways through emigration, especially by young
people.
   Poland's friends should understand that one cannot wait until we
are sinking. Economic reconstruction will serve not only our country
but also the whole European commuity.
   Europe is one, including the East as well as the West.
Transformations in the Soviet Union arouse our lively sympathy. We
understand their significance for the political opening in our
country as well. We desire to maintain good-neighborly, friendly
relations with the Soviet Union.
   For the first time, a chance is appearing for the relationship
between our nations to be based on friendship and cooperation
between the societies and not just among a single party.
   This is a great opportunity which cannot be wasted. We understand
the significance of obligations resulting from the Warsaw Pact. To
all its members, I state that the government that I will form will
respect this treaty.
   High Chamber,
   The change in Poland's political situation stems from the fact
that the new government is formed on Solidarity's initiative in
agreement with United Peasants Party and Democratic Party.
   This is perceived as an extraordinary event in our political life.
   The possibility that every force in parliament could form the
government must become something completely normal.
   The government I am forming does not assume responsibility for
the legacy it inherits. However that influences the circumstances in
which we must function.
   We separate ourselves from the past with a thick line. We will be
responsible only for what we have done to lift Poland from the
present state of collapse.
   I am aware that for my compatriots today the most important
question is whether it could be better.
   We will all reply to this. The success of the activities of the
future government depends on whether it will be accepted and
understood by the society.
   All social and political forces represented in the parliament and
those existing outside must define their position in the face of the
new situation.
   It poses a challenge for everyone and especially for the young
generation, which must take notice of a great opportunity to solve
the challenges we face.
   The government will not cure anything. We must do it together.
Poland will be different if everybody wants it.

<HEAD>Price Outlook Called Mostly Bright For Consumers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American consumers can expect mostly stable
energy prices in the 1990s, but parts of the Northeast are likely to
face a squeeze on electricity supplies early in the decade, an
industry research group said Thursday.
   The Gas Research Institute, sponsored by natural gas pipeline and
distribution companies, said the big increase in oil prices that
many forecasters have projected for the mid-1990s is unlikely to hit
before the turn of the century.
   A key reason for expecting a longer period of stable prices, the
group said, is that oil production in high-cost fields, such as the
North Sea, has remained strong. Some high-cost production has been
lost, particularly in the United States, but the overall decline has
been smaller than expected after the 1986 price crash.
   The group's 20-year forecast also said that demand for
electricity was likely to grow slowly, but that some areas
nonetheless would experience severe supply problems.
   ``Capacity shortfalls are now virtually unavoidable in critical
areas such as New England,'' the forecast said, because too little
generating capacity is being added. It said the electricity crunch
could hit New England within a few years.
   Even if the nation's electricity use grows relatively slowly to
the year 2000, electric utilities will have to build the rough
equivalent to 45 new large-scale power plants beyond what's now
planned, the report said.
   Oil prices by 1995 are likely to be about $18 a barrel, in
current dollars, rising to about $20 a barrel by the year 2000, the
group said. Oil currently is selling for about $18 a barrel, up from
about $15 a barrel last year.
   Some forecasters expect a more rapid price escalation, although
many have scaled back their projections in recent years as major oil
producers in the Middle East have continued to be saddled with more
production capacity than the market needs.
   The Energy Department, for example, has reduced its oil price
projections but still foresees an average price of $28 a barrel, in
current dollars, by the year 2000.
   Daniel Dreyfus, vice president for strategic planning and
analysis at the Gas Research Institute, said the price of oil will
move erratically in the 1990s but probably will not return to the
low levels of late 1988, when it sunk to about $12 a barrel.
   ``We've been through the lowest of oil prices,'' he told a news
conference.
   A faster price escalation is likely after the turn of the
century, Dreyfus said, as world oil demand moves more into balance
with available supplies. The forecast said the price, in current
dollars, would be about $32 a barrel in 2010.
   Low oil prices during the 1990s imply generally stable prices for
all types of energy, including natural gas, coal and products made
from oil, such as gasoline, the forecast said. This is because oil
is the most versatile and the dominant energy source.
   The report also said U.S. oil imports would reach 13.4 million
barrels a day by 2010, nearly double the current rate and meeting
about two-thirds of total U.S. oil needs. Imports will rise, it
said, as domestic production continues to fall.

   Egg production continues to drop, meaning
higher prices for consumers, an Agriculture Department report showed
Thursday.
   July production was estimated at 5.63 billion eggs, down 2
percent from a year earlier, the report said. Production included
4.89 billion eggs for the table and 738 million for hatching.
   As of Aug. 1, the laying flock was about 264.2 million birds,
down 2 percent from a year ago.
   However, production averaged 68.1 eggs per 100 birds, virtually
the same as a year earlier, the report said.

   John F. Kennedy Jr. is due for his first
appearance before a judge since becoming an assistant district
attorney _ but as a defendant, not a prosecutor.
   Kennedy, 28, has a Friday date before an administrative law judge
at the state Department of Motor Vehicles in the borough of Queens
to answer summonses for speeding and driving an uninsured,
unregistered and uninspected vehicle, agency spokesman Tom Apple
said Thursday.
   Port Authority police issued the summonses July 9 after stopping
Kennedy for doing 63 mph in a 50 mph zone, Apple said.
   Kennedy pleaded guilty by mail to speeding and driving an
uninspected car, but his check was not enough to cover his $127
fines, and he did not answer the other two charges, Apple said.
   The son of the late president could delay the hearing with a
phone call or send his lawyer if he simply intends to plead guilty,
Apple said. A guilty plea on the uninsured vehicle charge would cost
Kennedy his license for one year, the spokesman said.
   Kennedy was sworn in as a prosecutor in the Manhattan district
attorney's office Monday. A spokesman for District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau, Gerald McKelvey, said, ``We expect Mr. Kennedy to handle
this in an appropriate manner.''

   The State Department promised the family of a
Palestinian American youth found shot dead in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank that it would press Israel to complete its investigation
of the killing, an Arab American group said Thursday.
   Department officials met with representatives of the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and relatives of
14-year-old Amjad Jibreen, whose body was found by a roadside last
week, two days after he disappeared.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said a pathologist
hired by the family had found that Jibreen was killed by a single
gun shot in the back and that there were no signs of torture or
other brutality.
   ``But we are still awaiting the results of the Israeli
investigation into this tragic incident,'' he said.
   The ADC, which protects the interests of Arab Americans, said
relatives were promised that U.S. Ambassador William Brown would
personally oversee the case.
   Jibreen was born and raised in Denver, and was sent to live with
his relatives in the West Bank town of El Bireh four years ago. He
was active in the Palestinian revolt against Israel's 22-year
occupation.

<HEAD>Few Whites Leaving Public Schools After Desegregation Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NATCHEZ, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge predicted about one-fourth
of white students would leave for private schools when he
consolidated this river city's two racially split high schools.
   But registration records show nearly as many students are
returning to public classrooms as are leaving as the opening of
newly desegregated schools nears, officials say.
   ``I'm very, very optimistic,'' Superintendent Melvin Buckley said
Wednesday. ``It looks like the issue of white flight may be a moot
point.''
   Records show that 50 students previously in private or parochial
schools have pre-registered in the public schools for 1989-90, while
60 students have transferred their public school records and
transcripts to private or parochial schools in the Natchez area. An
additional 30 transcripts were requested by students whose families
have moved from Natchez.
   Classes open Sept. 5 in the district, which enrolled about 6,400
students in 1988-89.
   When he ordered a sweeping desgregation in July, U.S. District
Judge William H. Barbour Jr. predicted that 560 to 700 white
students, 24 to 29 percent of white enrollment, would leave.
   Private and parochial schools, where classes started this week,
show increased enrollment, but spokesmen say the numbers are less
than expected a month ago.
   Adams County Christian School reported fewer than 200 new
students. Many of those are new to the Natchez area and many are
pre-schoolers and kindergarteners, a staff member said. Earlier,
there were predictions the school might see as many as 600 new
students.
   Enrollment at Natchez Cathedral School, operated by the Catholic
Diocese of Jackson, is up slightly this fall. Exact enrollment
figures will be made public in September.
   ``I really think it's going to work. I think, finally, the
majority of people want to see what the end product will be, what
the school system is going to be like,'' said George F. West Jr.,
school board president. ``Really, the response is interesting. It's
totally different from what people had expected.''
   Barbour's ruling consolidates the predominantly white South
Natchez and all-black North Natchez High student bodies into one.
They will attend the former South Natchez campus in a school that
will be known as Natchez High.
   The former North Natchez campus will be a middle school for
grades 7 through 9. The judge's ruling also created two elementary
school attendance zones and paired an all-black school with a
majority-white school in each zone.
   Buckley said that if enrollment holds up, the district will not
have to lay off any of its 450 teachers. Administrators had feared
that between 14 and 40 teachers could lose their jobs if enrollment
fell drastically.

   Would-be passengers on Eastern Airlines who
were unable to use their tickets because of the strike against the
company were advised by the Department of Transportation Thursday
that they must file claims for refunds by Aug. 31.
   The department said Eastern customers seeking ticket refunds
should file a proof of claim form with the federal bankruptcy court
in New York. Proof of claim forms may be obtained from a federal
courthouse or from Eastern by calling (800) 628-0010.
   The department said it issued the consumer advisory because it
believed many ticketholders might not have heard about the deadline.
Eastern and the bankruptcy court initially advised passengers not to
file claims until a procedure was established, the advisory said.
   On July 21, Eastern filed a plan calling for full refunds in
cash, with interest, to people holding unused tickets purchased
before the carrier filed for bankruptcy protection on March 9 and
severely reduced its schedules. This plan still must be approved by
the court.

<HEAD>Party Calls on Baltic Residents to Work for Reforms, Not Secession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALLINN, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One day after hundreds of thousands of
people joined hands in the Baltic republics to call for freedom, the
Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Thursday the answer is not
secession but Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   Describing the ``secessionist mood'' in Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia, Pravda asked: ``Is there an alternative to it?''
   Yes, it answered, putting forward the party's reforms, championed
by Gorbachev, that propose more independence to republics within the
framework of the Soviet Union and call for the ``scrupulous and
friendly labor'' needed to implement them.
   According to official media and local activists, more than 1
million people stood hand-in-hand across the Baltic republics on
Wednesday to mark the 50th anniversary of a secret agreement between
Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin that put the then-independent nations
into the Soviet orbit.
   The gigantic protest, organized by grassroots groups in Estonia,
Lithuania and Latvia, reflected activists' growing calls for full
independence from Moscow instead of merely increased sovereignty.
   ``I've never lived in an independent Lithuania,'' said graphic
illustrator Audrius Ciocys, 30, as he stood in the line with his
wife and 3-year-old son. ``I believe there will be one _ for my son
there must be.''
   Edgar Savisaar, leader of the Estonian People's Front, said he
believed the republic's parliament might decide as soon as October
to schedule a republic-wide referendum on independence.
   Faced by a protest of such astonishing scale, the Soviet
government's position seemed to be that the demonstration's aims
were so vague that the turnout could not be seen as a wholesale
endorsement of Baltic nationalists' demands for independence.
   ``There's a varied picture there,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Yuri A. Gremitskikh told a regular news briefing in Moscow. ``Some
prominent political figures yesterday in the Baltic republics said
they thought that issues that are raised should be resolved by
political means, and I believe we could quite agree with that
opinion.''
   In its coverage of the Baltic protest, the Soviet government
daily Izvestia gave a sympathetic account of the formation of the
``human chain,'' but condemned other demonstrations by harder-line
groups that, for example, in Vilnius, Lithuania, bore signs linking
the Nazi swastika with the Soviet hammer and sickle.
   On Aug. 23, 1939, Hitler and Stalin divided Eastern Europe into
spheres of influence and less than a year later Stalin annexed the
Baltic states.
   Moscow Radio on Wednesday quoted a Moscow's historian's
``dismissal as unlawful'' any attempts to claim that the Soviet hold
on the Baltic states is invalid because it stems from the 1939 pact.
   Gremitskikh told reporters the Soviet Union is not the only
country with a stake in Baltic tranquility.
   ``If you rock the multinational Soviet boat, at the same time you
rock the common European boat, and you know quite well by now that
we live in a very closely knit and interdependent world,'' the
Foreign Ministry spokesman said. ``The stability of any individual
state is just part of the general stability.''
   Official estimates provided by the Tass news agency said 500,000
people turned out for the protest in Lithuania, a republic of 3.7
million people, and that 300,000 of Estonia's 1.6 million people
took part.
   There was no official estimate from Latvia, but the People's
Front grassroots organization in Riga estimated that 400,000 people
turned out there.
   Moscow activists tried to organize a sympathy protest, but police
and a special anti-demonstration unit broke it up. Tass said 75
people were detained.
   In the southwestern Soviet republic of Moldavia, also annexed by
the Soviet Union under the secret agreement, about 10,000 people
attended an outdoor rally in heavy rain, activists reported.

<HEAD>Group Says It Expects Thousands for Saturday March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the NAACP say they expect several
thousand people to gather on the capital's monument grounds Saturday
for a civil rights demonstration modeled after the historic ``Silent
March'' conducted 72 years ago in New York City.
   The Washington reprieve ``will be concerned with one issue alone
_ the Supreme Court and its recent hostile decisions'' diluting
affirmative action and minority set-aside programs, according to
Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the NAACP.
   But the brief march, led by six drummers with muffled drums, is
designed to duplicate in tone and style the 1917 demonstration in
which 8,000 people, led by W.E.B. DuBois, paraded in silence down
New York City's Fifth Avenue to protest segregation and the
lynchings of blacks in the South.
   Organizers have asked men to wear black, and women to children to
wear white. The march will culminate with a rally at the Capitol,
where Hooks and other civil rights leaders will speak. The Rev.
Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Jospeh Lowery, head of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, and mayors Kurt Schmoke of
Baltimore and Marion Barry of Washington also are scheduled to
appear.
   Hooks and other NAACP officials would not predict a turnout more
specific than ``several thousand.'' Hooks said ``We are not looking
toward bringing vast numbers of peopole to Washington. In this
instance, the medium is the message and the medium is the silent
march.''
   The Supreme Court has often been the target of major
demonstrations in the capital in recent years. Last spring, an
estimated 325,000 turned out to urge the court to stand by its 1973
decision which legalized abortion, but the court, weeks later,
softened that ruling in a case seen as a victory for anti-abortion
forces.

   New York City attorney Stuart E. Abrams will be
the lead prosecutor for the case of Iran-Contra arms dealer Albert
Hakim, Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh announced Thursday.
   Abrams, 36, a partner in the Chicago-based law firm of Mayer,
Brown &amp; Platt, was an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern
District of New York from 1982 to 1989. He prosecuted bank fraud,
public corruption, money-laundering and tax-evasion cases, and was
in charge of the district's Major Crimes Unit from 1986 to 1988.
   Hakim is charged with conspiring to pay illegal gratuities, in
connection with the installation of a security fence at the home of
former National Security Council staffer Oliver North; and in the
establishment of a Swiss bank account for North's children.
   Hakim and his partner during the Iran-Contra affair, Richard
Secord, were North's chief arms dealers in the secret supply
operation for the Nicaraguan Contras.
   No trial date has been set.

<HEAD>U.S. Magistrate Clears Way For Greek Banker's Extradition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fugitive Greek banker, accused in a
multimillion-dollar embezzlement scheme that helped topple the
government of Premier Andreas Papandreou, may be extradited to his
homeland, a magistrate ruled Thursday.
   In her order of extradition, U.S. Magistrate Joyce Alexander
found that the charges facing George Koskotas merited extradition
under a United States treaty with Greece, particularly his alleged
use of a fraudulent travel visa.
   Koskotas, 35, former chairman of the Bank of Crete, is accused by
Greek authorities of embezzling $200 million from 1986 to 1988 by
placing the bank's funds in his own accounts and accounts held by
his associates.
   Koskotas maintains he acted with the approval of Papandreou and
put the money into accounts controlled by the premier's party.
   Alexander's ruling clears the way for the State Department to
send Koskotas back to Greece, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney
Victor A. Wild.
   Susan Kempe, a Greek desk officer at the State Department in
Washington, could not immediately say what action the department
would take.
   However, Alexander granted attorneys for Koskotas a stay to
prepare an appeal. Koskotas will remain in custody.
   Koskotas had earlier refused to testify at his extradition
hearing.
   ``I am afraid if I testify here today I would endanger the lives
of my wife and children,'' he told the court.
   His attorney, Ron Liebman, said that Koskotas fled Brazil shortly
after learning Greek secret police were dispatched with orders to
kill him.
   Liebman was on vacation, and did not immediately return telephone
calls placed to his office.
   Among other things, Koskotas is accused of arranging a loan to be
deposited in a German bank, funneled through his brother, Stavros
Koskotas, and used to purchase a major soccer player from the German
soccer club Eintract Frankfurt for his team, Olympiakos.
   Koskotas has been held at the Essex County Jail in Salem since he
was arrested by federal authorities in November 1988 when he arrived
from Brazil.

<HEAD>Celeste Welcomes Extension of China Exhibit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CHALFANT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Richard Celeste welcomed a nine-week
extension of a Chinese art exhibit Thursday, weeks after blocking
China from taking part in the Ohio State Fair because of the deadly
crackdown on students in Beijing.
   The closing day of the exhibition, which has attracted 530,000
visitors since it opened March 1, was extended from Sept. 4 to Nov.
5.
   The governor said at a news conference that ending the exhibition
early had been considered in response to the attack by Chinese
government troops on pro-Democracy students in Beijing in which
hundreds were believed killed, but said that was considered
inappropriate.
   Celeste said there was no inconsistency in extending the exhibit
within weeks of telling the Chinese they could not participate in
the fair.
   ``This is an exhibit sent here to help encourage understanding of
several thousand years of Chinese art and history, and would help us
to put, perhaps, events in China in some kind of a historical
context,'' he said.
   ``The participation in the Ohio State Fair was an altogether
different matter. It was something that was directly related to the
relationship that we have had with our sister province (Hubei),''
Celeste said.
   ``It was with great reluctance even there that I took the actions
that I took, but I think we've conveyed a message about how people
in Ohio feel about current events in China,'' he said.
   Celeste said the exhibition was a unique venture which should be
encouraged to continue. It was organized by the Overseas
Archaeological Exhibition Committee of the People's Republic of
China and Son of Heaven Inc. of Seattle.
   Son of Heaven has drawn visitors from all 50 states and from 50
nations.

<HEAD>Hot Springs Evidence Mounts at Nation's Deepest Lake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists searching the
bottom of Crater Lake said Thursday that they have found evidence of
hot springs, a finding that could influence commercial energy
development outside the park.
   Oregon State University oceanographer Jack Dymond reported
measuring a temperature of 64 degrees Monday in a mat of bacteria
near the bottom of the lake. That is about 26 degrees higher than
the surrounding water.
   ``We found the temperatures we've been looking for for three
years,'' said Crater Lake National Park biologist Jim Milestone. He
said the lake bottom exploration now will concentrate on measuring
the flow of water from the point where the temperature was recorded.
   Crater Lake, the nation's deepest _ 1,932 feet _ and clearest
lake, was formed when the Mount Mazama volcano erupted about 6,800
years ago and collapsed to form a gigantic bowl called a caldera.
   The underlying rock is still warm from volcanic activity and the
lake rarely ices over in winter.
   California Energy Co. is drilling an exploratory hole less than
one mile from the southeast corner of the park boundary in the
Winema National Forest in hopes of developing a geothermal power
plant, using underground hot water or steam to generate electricity.
   The National Park Service fears the drilling could affect
geothermal activity under the lake or that drilling fluids could
migrate through the rock to vents where hot water flows into the
lake and affect its water quality. Officials also don't know if the
drilling could affect the way water leaves the lake, which is filled
by rain and snowmelt and has no surface outlet.
   The agency also doesn't want the noise and steam clouds that
would be created by power generation so close to the park boundaries.
   Dymond made the temperature readings in a one-man submersible
that he has used to explore the lake this month. The reading was
taken near the spot where Dymond's colleague, Robert Collier,
recorded a temperature of 61 degrees one day earlier during a dive
in the submersible.
   Park Superintendent Robert Benton said it was uncertain how this
new evidence would affect the park's fight against the geothermal
energy exploration.
   ``That's a political decision,'' Benton said. ``I would be
technically a lot more confident when they put the whole package
together.''
   Congress last year declared the park as containing significant
geothermal features. However, that status is up for review pending
the results of the current three-year exploration of the lake bottom.
   If the park's significant geothermal status holds up, the
secretary of the Interior Department would have the power to curtail
future geothermal development outside the park if it could threaten
features in the lake.
   In another development, Milestone said high levels of radon gas
have been measured in mysterious blue pools discovered earlier this
month on the lake bottom.
   Milestone said that radon in excess of 700 decays per minute per
100 liters was measured in samples from the blue pools. That
compares to radon levels on the lake surface of 1 decay per minute
per 100 liters.

   Americans, once resistant to the idea of paying
for public school changes, now are willing to pay higher taxes to
implement a variety of school reforms, including a national
curriculum, a Gallup Poll said Thursday.
   In fact, 70 percent of those questioned for the 21st Annual
Gallup Poll of the Public's Attitudes Toward Public chools, released
by Phi Delta Kappa, a professional educational fraternity, favored
requiring public schools to conform to national achievement
standards and goals. Only 19 percent were opposed and 11 percent
were undecided.
   Ten years ago, a Gallup Poll showed a two-to-one opposition to
federal curriculum standards.
   As for taxes, 64 percent of the respondents in the latest file
said they would pay higher taxes to improve the quality of public
schools in poorer communities. In 1983, 58 percent said they would
pay higher taxes to raise the standards of public education.
   ``The public is more receptive to higher taxes than they have
been in the past, this is a change that is quite a change, a major
change,'' said Alec N. Gallup, coauthor of the report. ``In the
past, they almost invariably said `no' to higher taxes.''
   John Rowley, president of Phi Delta Kappa, said the public is
more willing now to have a national curriculum because of the
results states have gotten from statewide tests.
   ``The public is ready for tradition-shattering changes in the
policies that govern U.S. public schools,'' said the poll, based on
in-home interviews conducted in early May and early June.
   Americans rate the quality of public schools poorly, with only 8
percent giving an ``A,'' 35 percent a ``B,'' 33 percent a ``C,'' 11
percent a ``D'' and 4 percent an ``F.'' Nine percent did not know or
did not reply, according to the poll.
   Key findings of the survey were:
   _Reducing class sizes in early grades was supported 75 percent to
18 percent while 68 percent said they would be willing to pay higher
taxes to make that possible.
   _60 percent favored allowing pupils and their parents to choose
which public schools in their communities youngsters will attend.
Thirty-one percent were opposed and 9 percent were undecided.
   _75 percent favored reducing class size in the early grades, now
often in the range of 20 to 35 pupils, to as few as 15 pupils, while
18 percent were opposed.
   _With those who favored requiring public schools to conform to
national achievement standards and goals, 61 percent wanted the
standards to be set by professional educators, 20 percent wanted a
panel of parents and other lay people to set the standards and fewer
than 10 percent wanted the standards set by the president, Congress
or governors.
   _69 percent favored requiring public schools to use a
standardized national curriculum, while 21 percent were opposed and
10 percent were undecided.
   _71 percent favored after-school and summer programs for students
whose parents work. Twenty-one percent were opposed.
   The idea of parental choice, already state law in Minnesota,
Arkansas and Iowa, is a centerpiece of the administration's
education policy.
   Findings of the new poll were largely consistent with results of
a Media General-Associated Press poll in June. Two-thirds of that
sample favored more spending on public schools, and nine out of 10
in that group would accept higher taxes to pay for it. Fifty-eight
percent said parents should be able to choose which public schools
their children attend.
   More than 40 percent favored year-round classes. However, 54
percent of the Media General-AP respondents said they did not
believe standardized tests reflect how well pupils are doing in
school.
   According to Gallup's results, parental choice gets stronger
support among nonwhites and young adults _ 67 percent for both
groups _ and in western states, at 64 percent. Twenty-one percent
believed parental choice would improve all schools. Only 14 percent
believed choice would hurt all schools.
   Opponents of parental choice have contended that it would lead to
some schools, particularly those in disadvantaged areas, being
drained of students and resources.
   Nearly three-fourths of those polled think it is ``very
important`` to improve the nation's inner-city schools. Substantial
majorities are willing to spend more taxes to expand Head Start
programs, 69 percent; to screen young children for health problems,
74 percent; and to provide day care for the children of working
parents, 58 percent.
   The survey used a sample of 1,584 adults spread through all areas
of the nation and in all types of communities. The margin of error
is plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<TEXT>
   A man who was told he must divorce his paralyzed
wife to get welfare assistance learned Thursday state officials
would reconsider.
   Alan Flowers had wept outside a courtroom Wednesday after a judge
handed down a 25-year prison term to the man who in January shot his
wife, Cynthia, 29, in the neck, paralyzing her from the chest down.
   ``What happened here ... was just a small part of what our
suffering is about now,'' said Flowers, 46.
   Reserve Circuit Judge Robert Cannon, who sentenced Clarence
Burgess, 52, vowed to look into the matter personally. Flowers
credited the judge's prodding for getting Milwaukee County
Department of Social Services officials to meet with him and his
wife at their home Thursday.
   The officials told Flowers they would reassess his wife's
eligibility for Aid for Families with Dependent Children.
   ``My heart goes out to Judge Cannon,'' Flowers said Thursday.
``He's a very, very fair and understanding judge.''
   Cannon said Thursday, ``I want to see that they're taken care of
immediately because apparently they've been getting the runaround
until this point.''
   Flowers said Social Services officials initially told him his
wife was not eligible for child care or other funds that would let
him return to work. He has turned over his auto sales and towing
business to a relative so he can care for his wife full-time.
   ``I was told that if I divorced her, she'd be eligible for AFDC
right away,'' he said. ``I turned and walked out of the office
crying.
   ``I can't do that. She's my wife.''
   Also on Thursday, a man who would only identify himself as
``Dan'' came to the couple's home and arranged to pay $1,659 in
delinquent payments on the couple's home, fending off repossession
for now.
   And a woman from the company that owns the wheelchair Mrs.
Flowers is using came to the house to tell the Flowers the chair
would not be repossessed as they had been told it would.
   ``There's nothing that can make me feel happy except to see my
wife get the help she needs'' so she can walk again, Flowers said.
   But the family's health insurance coverage ran out six weeks ago,
cutting off funding for her physical therapy.
   ``When she got out of the hospital, she could move her toes and
ankles,'' Flowers said. ``Now, without the therapy, it's nothing.''
   The state Justice Department's crime victims' compensation fund
awarded the family $40,000, but all the money went to the county for
medical bills, Flowers said.
   ``We never saw a dime, and there's over $180,000 still owed for
medical bills,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Lutheran Denomination Confronts Familiar Issues: Budget And Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROSEMONT, ILL. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America held its first decision-making assembly Thursday and quickly
confronted two problems nagging many other denominations: abortion
and money.
   Abortion, like many other issues on which the newly merged
denomination so far has not established policies, broke unscheduled
into the process at a women's caucus meeting.
   The caucus proposed a resolution opposing attempts to
re-criminalize or restrict abortion, contending that action on the
issue had become necessary because of the recent U.S. Supreme Court
decision permitting state restrictions.
   To objections that a resolutions committee wanted to refer that
issue to a planned two-year study of sexuality, Barbara Nelson of
Lindsborg, Kan, replied:
   ``It is a stopgap until that study is done. It's about what's
happening in some states now.''
   The three major Lutheran denominations in the United States, the
Lutheran Church in America, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and
the American Lutheran Church, merged into the new 5.3-million-member
church on Jan. 1, 1988. The three denominations had taken varying
positions on abortion.
   The eight-day assembly, representing the fourth-largest body in
U.S. Protestantism, began Wednesday.
   On the troubling financial situation, Bishop Herbert W.
Chilstrom, the denomination's president, told the approximately
1,050 delegates at the O'Hare Exposition Center, ``You ought to get
it out of your heads that there is some quick-fix for the problem.''
   Chilstrom said congregational giving was up a strong 5.5 percent
last year, outpacing inflation, and totaling $1.1 billion.
   But local churches used 92 percent of it, either on
congregational expenses or for local projects for the needy or
special causes such as hunger, relaying a reduced 8 percent for work
of regional synods or the national church.
   As with most major denominations, ``a higher percentage of funds
is staying at the local level,'' he said.
   He said the denomination had a $15.8 million shortfall below its
$104.3 million in expenditures in its first 14 months and a
continuing deficit in its 1989 budget, with expenditures cut from a
planned $99 to $92 million.
   To cope with the shortage, Childstrom detailed various measures
taken to cut expenses, including a hiring freeze, curtailed travel,
reduced meetings, no salary increase and some planned staff
reductions.
   ``It would seem out of the question for a reduction in services
and programs that are offered churchwide,'' he said.
   A special program among congregations, including an emphasis on
tithing, is planned to counter the financial squeeze.
   Chilstrom said that ``false assumptions about savings'' resulting
from church mergers was behind the drop in congregational support to
churchwide operations, as well as mounting local costs and expanded
local help projects.
   The denomination's executive council recommended a 1990 budget of
$102.5 million, with provisions that it be periodically revised to
keep expenditures in line with revenues.

   When Tadeusz Mazowiecki faced the press
Thursday for the first time as prime minister of Poland, the modest
journalist limited the limelight so he could talk with two men who
guided him to his place in history.
   ``I would like to say that having left this room, in a moment, I
will call the Holy Father, John Paul II. And then the first prime
minister from Solidarity will get through to Lech Walesa,''
Mazowiecki said as he concluded the news conference.
   Then he thanked the scores of journalists who had peppered him
for more than an hour with questions on everything from his economic
plan to his travel schedule and urged them to change their focus:
   ``I ask you for further interest not in myself, but in Poland, in
our common problems, and for friendliness.''
   After President Wojciech Jaruzelski nominated the Solidarity
editor as prime minister Saturday, journalists besieged his cramped
offices at the independent movement's weekly newspaper, hoping for a
few words with the man about to lead the East bloc's first
non-Communist government.
   Before meeting the press Thursday, Mazowiecki visited his new,
spacious offices at the Council of Ministers building below the
cavernous hall where the news conference was held.
   ``I wanted to see ... I noticed that it was a little bit dark in
there. The windows are small, but the space is huge. I'd like to
preserve some human element,'' he said.
   A journalist since he founded the Catholic monthly Wiez, or Link,
in 1958, Mazowiecki spoke Thursday about the problems of the press
in Poland where the Communist government has tightly controlled
newspapers, radio and television.
   Solidarity was granted access to the mass media in the April
accords that led to restoration of its legal status after a
seven-year ban. The vigorous underground press went public, and
lines form for Mazowiecki's weekly and the opposition daily as soon
as they hit the newsstands.
   Solidarity also was given limited time on TV and radio, and
censorship rules have been much relaxed.
   The new prime minister said he is determined that society be
honestly informed about his government's activities.
   ``I want this government to tell the truth,'' he said.
   But asked whether he would abolish censorship, Mazowiecki replied
the president and parliament were responsible for changes in that
policy.
   In the coming months, the news may be bitter as Mazowiecki tries
to put together an economic plan to fight inflation, meet a $39
billion foreign debt and fill stores with goods shoppers can afford
or want to buy.
   Mazowiecki asked for time to name ministers representing Poland's
many political factions and develop an economic approach.
   ``My first task is to form the government and get acquainted with
everything. I'm not going to show any bright ideas right now because
they wouldn't be true. Maybe I'll be able to tell you more in a few
days,'' he said.
   That government that will be different from any he has known for
45 years, and Mazowiecki was asked about trips he probably never
thought he would take in a role he hardly could have imagined.
   ``Of course, I will be happy to go to Moscow and I will be happy
to go to Washington, if such is the need of Poland,'' he said.
   The country to send the first telegram of congratulations was,
unexpectedly, East Germany, a Warsaw Pact ally that has been highly
skeptical of the radical departures from socialism undertaken by its
neighbor to the east.
   Mazowiecki said Poland's democratic reforms do not represent a
threat to countries within the military alliance that he has pledged
to respect.
   ``I don't think that people striving for reforms should be
identified with enemies of the Warsaw Pact and those who want to
undermine it,'' he said.
   The new prime minsiter also said he expected a cordial
relationship with Jaruzelski, who only eight years ago declared
martial law to suppress Solidarity and imprison thousands of
activists, including Mazowiecki.
   ``It is my task and duty as prime minister to fully respect the
competences of the president and I hope for full respect for myself
on the part of the president. My first contacts with the president
show that it is going to be like that,'' he said.
   He appealed for patience from Poles, many of whom are more
interested in a quick improvement in their living standards than
dramatic steps toward democracy.
   ``I think that at the moment we should hope. I'd like to express
such hope and ask people who are on strike or intend to, to enable
this government to form itself and begin its activities,'' he said.
   And he set his goal: ``What I would like to achieve _ and I say
this with all sincerity and openness _ is what Poland needs very
badly: creation of a new climate.''

   Researchers announced Thursday that they had discovered and
isolated the gene that causes cystic fibrosis, a landmark finding
that could lead to new treatments for the devastating killer of
young people.
   The discovery should help reveal just what goes wrong in the body
to cause the disease, which in turn may suggest how to treat the
root of the disease rather than just its effects, scientists said.
   The work will also help permit greatly expanded testing to
identify the estimated 12 million Americans who unknowingly carry
the gene in a defective form that causes the disease and who could
pass it along to offspring, said researcher Lap-Chee Tsui.
   These ``carriers'' remain healthy because they carry only a
single copy of a defective form of the newfound gene. The disease
does not appear unless a person inherits two defective copies, one
from each parent.
   Currently, carriers can be identified only if their family has
had a case of cystic fibrosis, and even then not all carriers can be
detected. Knowing the gene should eventually make testing available
to the general population, scientists said.
   Tsui, of the Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute in
Toronto, spoke in a telephone interview before participating in a
news conference to announce the finding.
   Tsui, Jack Riordan of the institute and Francis Collis of the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the University of Michigan at
Ann Arbor led the research team, which also included scientists from
the Frederick Cancer Research Facility in Frederick, Md., and the
University of Pittsburgh.
   Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal genetic disease of
young people in North America. It afflicts about 30,000 Americans,
and 1,000 to 1,200 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to
the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in Bethesda, Md.
   The disease makes the body produce abnormally thick, sticky mucus
that clogs the lungs and digestive system, interfering with
breathing and digestion.
   Half of patients die before reaching their mid-20s, mostly from
repeated lung infections.
   For cystic fibrosis, the discovery of the gene is ``the most
exciting event since this disease was first described in the medical
literature 50 years ago,'' said Robert Beall, executive vice
president for medical affairs at the cystic fibrosis foundation,
which helped support the research.
   It may allow researchers to mimic the disease in cells in the
test tube, allowing them to screen drugs for therapeutic effect, he
said.
   ``It's incredibly important,'' said Nancy Lamontagne, director of
the cystic fibrosis program at the National Institute of Diabetes
and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
   It will cause ``an exponential burst of good research'' to
identify the basic problem that causes cystic fibrosis, and then
seek treatments aimed at that problem, she said.
   ``If you know exactly what you're trying to fix ... then you can
approach it with a more specific bullet,' she said.
   Because of the disease's importance, finding the gene is ``the
big prize,'' said Michael Conneally, professor of medical genetics
and neurology at Indiana University Medical Center.
   But Arthur Beaudet of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the
Baylor College of Medicine cautioned that the discovery will not
necesarily lead to effective treatment. The basic defect that causes
sickle cell anemia has long been known, but that has not led to an
effective therapy, he said.
   Genes are segments of a threadlike structures called chromosomes.
The newfound gene is on the chromosome scientists refer to as No. 7.
   One important job of genes is to oversee the body's production of
key proteins. Genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis can occur
when a gene is defective, so that it fails to produce a normal
protein.
   Tsui said the normal role of the newly discovered gene is not
known. But the protein it helps produce appears to be similar
structurally to a family of genes involved in transporting
substances across cell membranes, he said.
   That fits in with the suspicion that cystic fibrosis results from
a defect in a cell's ability to transport electrically charged
particles across cell walls, he said.
   Researchers identified an abnormality in the gene that appears to
be responsible for most cystic fibrosis cases, Tsui said. Other
mutations in the same gene apparently cause the remainder of the
cases, he said.
   The identified abnormality did not appear in chromosomes known to
be normal, he said. In addition, the gene appears to be activated
only in the kinds of cells involved in cystic fibrosis, he said.

   Senior Solidarity activist Tadeusz
Mazowiecki was elected prime minister Thursday in a historic switch
from Communist rule that he said should give the ``green light to
Polish hope.''
   The once inconceivable change for Eastern Europe came about not
through revolution but in an orderly parliamentary vote, with
Communist Party members joining Solidarity deputies to elect the
journalist and former political prisoner 378-4 with 41 abstentions.
   It was the first non-Communist government to be seated in Warsaw
since 1944.
   Among the first to celebrate was Solidarity chief Lech Walesa,
who engineered the coalition that gave Mazowiecki a solid majority
in parliament and then got Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski
to go along with the deal.
   ``I will do everything so that my premier, my child ... passes
the test before society,'' pledged a jubilant Walesa in Gdansk after
watching Mazowiecki's election on television. He wished Mazowiecki
success in ``transforming our country from a totalitarian system to
democracy.''
   Congratulations also arrived from President Bush and from the
prime minister of Communist East Germany, one of the least
reform-minded countries in the East bloc.
   The Soviet Union, for whom Poland is the largest and most
strategic Warsaw Pact ally, greeted the election with equanimity.
   ``We shall regard Comrade Mazowiecki as our partner in the
relations that link our two countries,'' said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh in Moscow.
   The Soviet Union invaded Hungary in 1956 and led an invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968 to maintain orthodox Communist rule.
   But Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev now rejects interfering
in the affairs of his allies and Moscow's political analysts
apparently believe a government under Solidarity is Poland's best
hope for stability.
   Members of every party, including the Communists, joined in to
support Mazowiecki and the election was greeted by a standing
ovation. First the Solidarity deputies stood, then members of minor
parties and finally the entire communist delegation.
   A solemn-looking Mazowiecki rose and gave a long bow to the
chamber.
   ``I am very touched at this moment. I thank you ... for this
great proof of trust,'' he said, urging that they ``raise up Poland
together.''
   After his election, Mazowiecki met for a half-hour with Gen.
Jaruzelski at the president's office and sipped champagne with the
staff of his former newspaper, the weekly Tygodnik Solidarnosc,
before facing journalists at a packed news conference.
   ``I can see a green light for Polish hope, which our nation must
light for itself by fighting above all for something _ for
democratic (and) economic changes _ above all for something and not
against someone,'' he told reporters.
   After the news conference, Mazowiecki said, he planned two
telephone calls: first to Polish-born Pope John Paul II, his friend,
and then to Walesa.
   He said he want to assemble a Cabinet within the next week and
would seek participation by all the parties in parliament, including
the Communists. But he refused to be specific about how many posts
for each.
   The Solidarity-led coalition committed itself in advance to
giving the key ministries of defense and internal affairs, with
control of the army and police, to the Communist Party. Mazowiecki
indicated Wednesday he would find other posts for Communists as well.
   But he told Communist deputies before the vote that it would make
no sense for Solidarity to form a government with just the prime
ministry and a few minor ministries.
   After Mazowiecki's election, 15 Communist Party parliament
deputies on behalf of the party's caucus submitted a proposal to
drop from the constitution a clause that mandates the Communist
Party be the ``leading political force'' in society.
   Mazowiecki will have to wrestle with daunting economic troubles,
including a $39 billion foreign debt, inflation climbing toward 200
percent annually and empty store shelves.
   He said he would seek economic support from the West but no
special ``privileges'' while trying to unlock the dormant energies
of Poles.
   Mazowiecki said he will support Poland's East bloc treaty
obligations, telling a questioner pointedly that it was wrong to
identify ``people striving for reforms'' as ``enemies of the Warsaw
Pact.''
   ``I want to form a government capable of acting for the good of
society, the nation and the state,'' Mazowiecki told the Sejm.
   His speech stressed the need to restore ``normal'' political and
economic life to Poland, including transition of power between
political parties and a market-oriented economy.
   The state ``cannot take care of everything and guarantee
everything,'' he said. ``Poland cannot afford ideological
experiments any longer.''
   His election came barely 15 months after he and Walesa led a
disappointed group of strikers out of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk
without winning any of their demands, the end to a nationwide wave
of labor unrest in April and May 1988.
   The strike, followed by a bigger strike wave in August, persuaded
authorities to renew a dialogue with Solidarity, which was
eventually legalized in April and won 260 of 261 seats it contested
in June parliamentary elections.
   Mazowiecki recalled that strike defeat Thursday.
   ``I think that neither them nor I thought that exit would lead to
my entrance here today,'' he said.

<HEAD>Official Says Damage To Pontalba Wasn't As Bad As It Looked</HEAD>

   A jumble of debris piled up in front of a
historic apartment building when a three-story scaffold collapsed,
but officials said Thursday the damage wasn't nearly as bad as it
looked.
   ``Everything is just cosmetic, really,'' said Manuel Weber,
director of maintenance for the Louisiana State Museum, which owns
the 138-year-old Lower Pontalba.
   Some sections of balcony and iron railings were pulled down in
the accident, said Weber. But bricks that appeared to be missing
after the collapse actually had already been removed as part of a
renovation project.
   No one was hurt when the scaffolding collapsed Wednesday evening.
No dollar estimate of the damage was available.
   No cause for the collapse has been determined, Weber said. State
officials met with the contractor Thursday and determined that
everyone involved was properly insured, he added.
   Authorities roped off the area around the building and a crane
lifted debris from the square Thursday afternoon.
   The three-story, state-owned building was completed in 1851 and,
with a companion building on the opposite side of Jackson Square,
was undergoing a $10 million renovation.
   ``The project is to replace the brick, brick by brick, on this
end of the Pontalba buildings,'' said James Sefcik, director of the
state museum, with headquarters nearby.
   Wednesday's accident was the second involving a Jackson Square
building in 16 months. In May 1988, fire destroyed the top floor of
the Cabildo, where the Louisiana Purchase territories were
transferred from France to the United States.
   The Upper Pontalba and Lower Pontalba are among five historic
buildings on three sides of Jackson Square. All are designated as
National Historic Landmarks.
   The others are the Cabildo, built in 1799; the St. Louis
Cathedral, rebuilt in 1851, and the Presbytere, started in 1791.

<HEAD>Misdirected Package Holds $2 Million in Gems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Businessman Larry Jackson expected an
overdue shipment of weightlifting gloves. The package he opened,
however, contained an estimated $2 million in uncut gems.
   ``Do I feel like a fool for turning it in?'' he said with a laugh
Thursday. ``Yeah.''
   The 50-pound, locked and sealed steel container was delivered by
American Eagle airlines Wednesday to Jackson's business, Atlas
Fitness Products Inc.
   The box had no return address, but it came with airline paperwork
showing it was the lost piece of a 25-package shipment of
weightlifting gloves Jackson received in July from Pakistan.
   Jackson took delivery even though it didn't resemble his usual
glove shipments. ``You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure
out that this was not what it was supposed to be. I mean, it came in
what was like a little vault,'' he said.
   So Jackson called the U.S. Customs office.
   ``The inspector on duty said just to hold it and return it to the
shipper,'' said Liz Orgeron, a Customs spokeswoman in New Orleans.
   But Jackson, a reserve deputy with the Knox County Sheriff's
Department, said he became concerned when no one retrieved the box
by the end of the day.
   ``I did not want to be responsible for it because I knew it was
something that appeared to be of great value,'' he said.
   Jackson called the sheriff's department and a detective was sent
out. But the detective didn't want to take possession of the package
without knowing what was inside.
   ``I understand his point,'' Jackson said. ``The thing came from
the Islamic world. God knows, what was in it. It could be cobra
venom ... or a bomb or something.''
   With the help of a local auto mechanic and his blowtorch, the box
was opened.
   Inside were more than 50 quartz-like stones, some purplish,
others milky white, wrapped in Afghan newspapers.
   A local jeweler, after consultation with a colleague, determined
the uncut gems were kunzite, which are native to Afghanistan, and
conservatively estimated their value at $2 million.
   Ms. Orgeron said American Eagle was trying Wednesday to track
down the gems' owner. Airline officials at company headquarters in
Dallas did not return phone calls.
   Ms. Orgeron said it was unclear where the package was supposed to
go, but the airline determined it was definitely not Knoxville. She
said the routing problem likely occurred when the package passed
through John F. Kennedy Airport near New York City.
   The gems were being kept in a vault at the sheriff's department
awaiting pickup by customs officials, said Sheriff Joe Fowler.
   Jackson, meanwhile, is still wondering where his missing gloves
are. ``Customs promised me they were going to make an effort to find
them,'' he said. ``That's the least they can do, since I'm not
allowed to keep the stones.''

<HEAD>Psychiatrist R.D. Laing Dead at 61</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scottish psychiatrist R.D. Laing, who became a guru
of the 1960s counterculture by arguing that madness probably was the
only way to face the modern world, is dead at age 61.
   His son Adrian said Laing died Wednesday while playing tennis in
St. Tropez, France.
   Laing pioneered new treatment for schizophrenics, believing them
to be victims of family stress. He contended there was little
distinction between the sane and the mad, that most psychiatry
increased patient misery and that marijuana should be legalized.
   His unorthodox views caused uproar in his profession for nearly
three decades, but he lived to see fellow psychiatrists take the
heresies seriously.
   ``He made individual contributions to new and constructive
thinking about the care of psychiatric patients,'' said a statement
from the Royal College of Psychiatrists.
   Laing's first book, ``The Divided Self: An Existentialist Study
in Sanity and Madness'' in 1960, made him famous and wealthy. He
wrote 14 other books, including a volume of sonnets.
   He recently had been living in Austria with his common-law wife,
Margarita, and their infant son, who survive him.
   Adrian Laing, 31, one of two sons by his first wife, told The
Associated Press his father collapsed on a tennis court at St.
Tropez while on vacation, but said he did not know the cause of
death.
   ``It's a shock,'' he said. ``He was an anti-establishment
character, but wasn't an anti-psychiatrist. He was more an
alternative psychiatrist. In later life he matured and mellowed.''
   ``He wanted to listen more to what people were saying, to look at
schizophrenic minds from their point of view,'' the son said. ``His
idea was just to let them go crazy, just let them get on with it. He
said you've got to understand the politics of the family.''
   Ronald David Laing was born in a three-room tenement apartment in
Glasgow, where his father was a city engineer, on Oct. 7, 1927. He
wrote in ``The Facts of Life,'' published in 1976, that his father
beat him for minor infractions of orders and his parents never tried
to communicate with or understand him.
   He said he was influenced by Sigmund Freud, Soren Kierkegaard,
Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche.
   After receiving a doctorate at Glasgow University, Laing served
with a psychiatric unit in the army and studied psychoanalysis at
the Tavistock Institute in London.
   Laing refused to treat patients with drugs or electric shock
unless they requested them. His best-known practical experiment was
to establish Kingsley Hall, a London hostel for schizophrenics,
where he pioneered therapeutic use of mescaline and LSD.
   ``His policy was to have people staying there to go through
madness as a self-healing process,'' his son said.
   In 1964, Laing founded the Philadelphia Association, a network of
establishments to house the mentally distressed without conventional
treatment.
   David Mercer's play ``In Two Minds,'' influenced by Laing and
filmed by Ken Loach in 1971 as ``Family Life,'' indicted suburban
living by showing a 19-year-old girl driven to mental collapse by
emotional and family problems.
   In later life, Laing had a private practice in London. He became
inrterested in Zen Buddhism in the 1970s and published transcripts
of conversations between himself and his children.
   He also is survived by his first wife, Anne, and their two sons
and two daughters, who include Adrian and Fiona, the elder daughter
who spent years in mental institutions and was treated for
schizophrenia.
   Two sons and a daughter from a second marriage also survive, as
well as a son by another common-law wife, Adrian said.
   Among Laing's other books are ``Sanity, Madness and the Family,''
``Reason and Violence'' and his account of the first 30 years of his
life, ``The Making of a Psychiatrist,'' published in 1985.
   He was working on a book called ``Sex and Jealousy'' when he died.

   President Bush on Thursday announced
he will name career foreign service officer Kenneth Brown as
ambassador to the Ivory Coast.
   Brown is deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs
and previously was consul general in Johannesburg. He was ambassador
to the Congo in 1981 and before that served in a variety of
diplomatic posts.
   Bush's vacation White House also announced the president will
name Christopher Jehn as assistant secretary of defense for
management and personnel, and Ronald E. Ray as asssistant secretary
of veterans affairs for human resources and administration.
   Jehn is vice president of the Navy-Marine Corps Planning and
Manpower division and has served in various other posts at the
Center for Naval Analysis, a federally funded research and
development center.
   Ray, a Medal of Honor winner for his Army service, is president
of the Ronald E. Ray, Inc. investment company in Winter Haven, Fla.,
and previously was a White House fellow in the Commerce Department.
   In addition, the White House said Bush will name Tony Armendariz
as a member of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, succeeding
Jerry Lee Calhoun, for the term expiring at the end of July 1992.
   Armendariz is general counsel for the University System of South
Texas in Kingsville, Texas. He was formerly the Texas assistant
attorney general and district counsel for the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
   The authority oversees labor relations with federal employees.

<TEXT>
   Flush with success, researchers
returned Thursday to the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald hoping for
more startlingly clear views of the famed vessel 556 feet beneath
the surface of Lake Superior.
   ``The tension is off,'' said Carol Swinehart of Michigan Sea
Grant, one of the sponsors of an expensive expedition to explore
shipwrecks with a small, deep-water robot that takes
three-dimensional video pictures.
   On Wednesday the robot obtained the first footage of the
Fitzgerald, the best known and most recent major Great Lakes
shipwreck. The 730-foot American ore carrier sank in a gale in
November 1975 in Canadian waters 17 miles off the coast of northern
Michigan. All 29 crew members died; their bodies never were
recovered.
   The tragedy became legend within a year, when Canadian balladeer
Gordon Lightfoot sang ``all that remains is the faces and the names
of the wives and the sons and the daughters.''
   Observers on the research ship Grayling were stunned by the
clarity of the images the robot relayed Wednesday.
   ``This is amazing, totally amazing,'' said archaeologist Phil
Wright of the Canadian Marine Heritage Conservation Program. He
watched a video monitor intently as the robot glided around the bow
of the wreck, peering close into broken windows, then backing up to
see the battered white ship sitting upright in the mud.
   The Fitzgerald showed little age. There was minimal rust and even
less sediment. The handset of a radio-telephone dangled from a
pilothouse window, one of the few signs that there had ever been
life aboard the silent vessel.
   Searchers had expected to encounter bodies, but none was seen in
the initial exploration Wednesday.
   ``We are not here to disturb, we are only here to remember. May
their souls rest in peace,'' Grayling Capt. Clifford Wilson said in
a short shipboard memorial service before the robot was lowered to
the underwater grave site.
   The wreck lies in two pieces, the bow rising upright out of the
mud and behind it, the overturned stern.
   The half-inch thick steel hull was crinkled and torn ``just like
tinfoil,'' said Chris Nicholson of Deep Sea Systems International,
who piloted the robot from a dark control room aboard the Grayling.
   Researchers saw crisp images of portholes burst by the force of
the water and electronic equipment torn from its moorings. Yet, a
water cooler remained standing with its stainless steel spout still
gleaming, and the ship's bell sat unmarred on top with its clapper
held silent by a thin cord.
   ``Outstanding,'' Tom Farnquist, director of the Great Lakes
Shipwreck Historical Society and one of three expedition leaders,
said as the robot completed its work Wednesday night. ``I was
surprised by the visibility. I was surprised that the bell was

<HEAD>INS Sees Red Over Black Market Green Cards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Green cards,'' which reflect an alien's
permanent resident status in the United States and have been
off-white since 1977, are being changed to pink in an effort to
curtail the black market in the documents, an official said Thursday.
   ``You can buy a lousy reproduction'' of the old green cards for
$5,000 to $10,000, said Immigration and Naturalization Service
spokesman Verne Jervis.
   ``But people have been known to pay $20,000,'' he said. ``It
depends on how much money the person has, how good the card is and
how much the person is willing to pay.
   ``Some people will pay an almost unending amount of money'' for
the cards, he said.
   Those who hold the cards have all the rights and privileges of
citizens except they cannot vote, may not leave the country for more
than a year without losing permanent resident status and do not hold
U.S. passports, he said.
   The new cards will be phased in over time, said Jervis.
   Production of the new cards began Aug. 1 at the Immigration Card
Facilitity in Arlington, Texas. The $4 million changeover of
equipment will be completed within a few months, but until then,
some of the cards being issued will remain the familiar off-white
color, he said.
   The INS changed the cards for several reason, he said.
   ``One, it's an improved card, as far as duplicating it is
concerned,'' he said. ``It has some additional security features,
such as the special ink'' that helps combat forgeries.
   ``Another reason is that the equipment that we have been
producing the card on for the last 12 years is due for a replacement
anyway,'' Jervis said. ``New technology has evolved during that
time. As long as we have to get new equipment, we may as well take
advantage of the new technology.''
   One feature of the new card is a stamped expiration date, he
said. The laminated cards will be valid for 10 years.
   The cards also have the individual's picture, fingerprint, name,
date of birth and file number on the front and encoded information
on the back, he said.
   The INS will not undertake the overwhelming task of replacing the
10 million cards already held by permanent resident aliens, said
Jervis.
   The service replaces about 230,000 cards a year that have been
either lost or stolen or because of changes such as a changed name,
Jervis said.
   A ``good many'' of the 230,000 were reported lost or stolen, said
Jervis, but he could not estimate how many of those may have ended
up being sold on the black market.
   The new cards, because of the encoded information, will enable
those who want replacements to do so by mail rather than in person,
which had been required for the old cards, he said.
   The INS is processing applications of 1.8 million people who
applied for temporary resident status under the amnesty program for
those who have been in the United States since before 1982. The
period to apply for that program ended in May 1988. After 18 months,
those people have one year to apply for permanent resident status,
he said.
   In addition, some 1.3 million special agricultural workers have
applied for temporary resident status under a separate program, and
they will be given permanent resident status without need for
additional application between December 1989 and December 1990,
Jervis said.

   The Bush administration is weighing the
possibility of tightening existing sanctions against Panama now that
efforts by the Organization of American States to achieve a
democratic transfer of power are at an apparent dead end, officials
said Thursday.
   The reevaluation of administration policy toward Panama followed
what officials regarded as a disappointing outcome of a three-month
effort by OAS mediators to promote a restoration of democratic rule
in Panama.
   The officials declined to specify what economic measures against
Panama are under consideration. Last year, the Reagan administration
froze Panama's assets in the United States, withheld fees owed to
Panama for Panama Canal operations and suspended certain trade
benefits.
   The measures have contributed to a substantial economic decline
in Panama.
   After OAS foreign ministers approved a blandly worded resolution
early Thursday following all-night discussions, the U.S. and
Panamanian delegations engaged in unusually heated verbal sparring,
with each side blaming the other for the impasse.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger compared Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega to Adolf Hitler and derided Panama as an
``outlaw regime'' that deserves the censure of all OAS member
states. Eagleburger's remarks prompted a walkout by Panamanian
Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter.
   In a vitriolic two-hour rebuttal, Panamanian delegate Romulo
Escobar Betancourt blamed the United States for the lack of progress
toward a political solution in Panama, citing both the U.S. economic
sanctions and what he described as the unsettling impact of U.S.
military maneuvers in Panama.
   He also challenged Eagleburger to prove his allegations about
Noriega's involvement in drug trafficking.
   ``If you have any evidence to show Gen. Noriega is involved in
drug trafficking, bring it here to the OAS,'' Escobar said. Noriega
was indicted last year on drug smuggling charges by two federal
grand juries in Florida.
   The OAS resolution expressed ``deep concern'' over the inability
of the mediators to lay the groundwork for a political settlement in
Panama. It also ``resolutely exhorts'' Panamanians to settle their
differences by the time a new president is scheduled to be sworn in.
   Under Panama's constitution, an ``elected president'' is due to
take office on Sept. 1, but Ritter said it is unclear what will
happen on that date because there is no officially recognized
successor to President Manuel Solis Palma.
   Panamanian authorities voided the outcome of last May's national
elections after independent observers concluded that the opposition
candidate had won by a comfortable margin.
   Ritter expressed hope that the government and opposition leaders
can agree on a course of action by Sept. 1 that would enable the
country to sidestep the possibility of a constitutional crisis.
   At the State Department Thursday, deputy spokesman Richard
Boucher said ``the key to solving the problem is for Noriega to be
willing to discuss the terms for his departure.''
   State Department officials were outraged Wednesday when a report
submitted by the OAS mediators blamed the United States, in part,
for the continuing impasse in Panama without making any reference to
Noriega.
   Specifically, the report said U.S. military maneuvers in Pamama
had a ``negative effect'' on the negotiating process and were
``inopportune.''
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Fred Hoffman defended the U.S.
military exercises in the canal area, saying they were conducted in
accordance with the Panama Canal treaties and the U.S. mission of
defending the canal.
   ``What we're doing is not confrontational,'' Hoffman said. ``We
have notified the PDF (Panamanian Defense Forces) in advance of
these exercises. They are are all covered fully under the terms of
the treaties.''
   The official U.S. view is that Noriega precipitated the crisis by
refusing to recognize the perceived victory by the opposition
candidate in the elections last May and then aggravated the
situation by insisting on retaining his post as commander of
Panama's military forces.

<HEAD>Center Says Commerce Guarding Turtle Findings Like Espionage Matter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Center for Marine Conservation accused the
Commerce Department on Thursday of squelching scientific findings
and treating the issue of endangered sea turtle deaths as if it were
a ``matter of Soviet intrigue and espionage.''
   The agency, caught between the opposing demands of shrimpers and
environmentalists, is under a court order to draft final regulations
by Sept. 8 that would protect endangered sea turtles from drowning
in shrimpers nets.
   The public was given 15 days to comment and has deluged the
department with thousands of letters. But the Center for Marine
Conservation says it has been unable to obtain biological opinions
from the agency's own scientists on the most effective way of
preventing sea turtle deaths.
   At issue is whether shrimpers must be required to equip their
nets with devices that allow turtles to escape, the choice of
environmentalists, or whether they should restrict their tow times
and check their nets before the submerged turtles drown, the choice
of many Gulf Coast shrimpers.
   Under temporary regulations, shrimpers are being required to pull
their nets every 105 minutes or use the turtle excluder devices,
TEDs.
   The Center for Marine Conservation said Commerce has
``squelched'' biological recommendations and ignored the findings of
its own scientists that TEDs are far more effective in preventing
turtle deaths than restricted tow times.
   The center's Marydele Donnelly accused the agency of withholding
so much information on its scientists' own studies that her
organization has been forced to file Freedom of Information Act
requests.
   ``Conservation of endangered species is not a matter of Soviet
intrigue and espionage,'' she said. ``The American public has a
right to know how and why Commerce Secretary ( robert) Mosbacher
came to such outlandish conclusions regarding 105-minute tow times
when the record is clear that these regulations are based on false
premises.''
   Commerce spokesman Brian Gorman said every possible credible
source of information, from within and outside the agency, is being
considered as the final rules are drafted.
   Meanwhile, public comment on the issue continues to pour in. The
National Marine Fisheries Service has counted 3,100 letters to date
and more are coming in, said Charles Karnella, chief of the
protected species management division.
   He said the letters are overwhelmingly in favor of TEDs, but
would not provide a tally.

   The number of medical-school applicants has
declined for the fourth straight year and scores on admissions tests
are down slightly, but there is no immediate threat to quality
medical care, a researcher said Thursday.
   And while more women and minorities are applying to medical
schools, there is room for improvement, said Barbara Barzansky,
assistant director of the American Medical Association's Division of
Undergraduate Education and co-author of a study in Friday's Journal
of the AMA.
   ``The increasing diversity is encouraging,'' Ms. Barzansky said.
``But there's a lot more _ especially in the area of minorities _
that needs to be done.''
   While the number of freshmen increased slightly for the first
time since 1984, applications and total enrollment still are down.
   ``There are a lot more opportunities for young people these days
where you can go out and start your career a lot sooner, instead of
having to spend four years in medical school and three years in
residency,'' Ms. Barzansky said.
   The number of applicants has dropped from 35,944 in 1984 to
28,123 in 1987 and 26,721 in 1988, the study showed.
   But the number of freshmen in 1988 increased to 16,781 from
16,686 the year before.
   That means medical schools accepted one freshman student for
every 1.6 applicants, up from one out of every 2.1 in 1984, the
report said.
   Average admissions-test scores for the students dropped slightly,
from 56.4 out of a total possible 90 in 1987 to 55.2 in 1988.
   But Ms. Barzansky said there was little cause for concern.
   ``It's not as if suddenly the whole medical school class has
declined drastically,'' she said. ``Students still have to meet the
same standards for graduation.''
   Ms. Barzansky said while applications and enrollment are down,
there is no immediate threat to the country's supply of doctors.
   ``If you look at the average number of physicians there's no
shortage,'' she said. ``If you look at certain specialties, there
may be a problem.''
   Possible problem areas include primary-care physicians _ mostly
general practitioners and family doctors _ and those willing to work
in rural and inner-city areas, she said.
   ``There are still concerns about providing medical care across
the country, making sure everybody's got access,'' Ms. Barzansky
said.
   Another study in the journal said 83 percent of medical school
graduates had education-related debts.
   The average owed was $38,489, up from the $14,600 owed on average
by the 74 percent of 1974 graduates with debts, said study co-author
Paul Jolly, an associate vice president at the Association of
American Medical Colleges.
   Jolly and Ms. Barzansky said increased financial aid is key to
easing debts and boosting minority enrollment.
   Ms. Barzansky's study showed that blacks make up 6 percent of all
medical school students, 5 percent of 1988 graduates and 6.3 percent
of last year's freshmen.
   Asian enrollment was up from 7.6 percent among graduates to 12.4
percent among entering freshmen, while Hispanic enrollment held
steady at about 5.4 percent, the study said.
   ``Minority enrollment is rising very slowly,'' Jolly said.
``There is a lot of financial aid available for minority students,
but it is not enough.''
   The number of women in medical schools also has increased, with
women making up 37 percent of those entering classes and 33.3
percent of graduates.
   The total number of women in medical school, however, has
declined since 1985, the study said.

<HEAD>Aircraft Designer Yakovlev Dead at Age 83</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aircraft designer Alexander S. Yakovlev, who built
warplanes that challenged German Messerschmitts in World War II and
modern passenger jets, has died after a long illness, Tass said
Thursday. He was 83.
   Yakovlev, who died Tuesday, was awarded the Soviet Union's
prestigious Lenin Prize and was twice named a Hero of Socialist
Labor. The official Soviet news agency did not say what illness he
had suffered from.
   He was eulogized in an obituary signed by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and other top Soviet officials.
   ``Yakovlev was known for his tireless search for fresh ideas,
creative courage and great talent for organization,'' Tass said.
   Born April 1, 1906, Yakovlev's career as a dedsigner spanned more
than 60 years. He was the last of a generation of aircraft designers
including Oleg Antonov, Alexei Tupolev and Sergei Ilyushin who
dominated Soviet aviation for decades.
   One Western expert in Moscow, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said it had been unclear in recent years whether Yakovlev
was still in charge of design of Yakovlev planes.
   As a 20-year-old aircraft fitter at Moscow's Central Airport in
1927, Yakovlev designed the AIR-1, a light airplane that set a world
record by covering the 800-mile route from the Crimean city
Sevastopol to Moscow in 15 hours and 30 minutes.
   The best-known Yakovlev planes of the past decade are the Yak-38,
known by NATO experts as the Forger, the country's only plane
capable of landing and taking off from naval vessels, and the
120-passenger Yak-42 short-haul passenger jet.
   Yuri Gagarin, a test pilot who was the first man in space, made
his first flights in a Yak-18 training plane.
   During World War II, Yakovlev's fighter planes, the Yak-1 through
Yak-9 were the dominant force in the Soviet air force. Of 61,000
fighters built by the Soviet Union during the war years, 37,000 of
them were Yaks.
   In a 1976 article, the weekly Moscow News cited a telegram the
Soviet Defense Committee received from air force pilots telling them
how they had fought off 25 German planes with seven Yak-1s.
   ``The pilots ... showed that these Soviet planes were more than a
match for the famous Messerschmitts and Junkers,'' it said.
   In the opinion of Western experts, the design of the Yak-3,
considered one of the best of Yakovlev's World War II fighters, was
``impossibly crude and the welding looked as if it had been done by
a village blacksmith,'' the paper said.
   But the outer finish was superb and the plane was reliable, it
said.
   In the postwar years, as the MiG became the dominant Soviet
jetfighter, Yakovlev increasingly turned his attention to civilian
aircraft.
   One such plane, the Yak-55, was displayed on Sunday in Moscow's
first air show in more than 20 years.
   Yakovlev, in a 1976 interview with the labor newspaper Trud on
his 70th birthday, said, ``I want to work and work, so that I can
penetrate still further into the unknown, so that I can reach new
unscaled summits. This is the purpose of life for a designer.''

   New chiefs for three Associated Press foreign
bureaus were named Thursday by Louis D. Boccardi, president and
general manager of the news cooperative.
   Andy Torchia, chief of bureau in Johannesburg for the past eight
years, becomes chief of Nordic services, based in Stockholm, Sweden.
He will be responsible for operations in Sweden, Norway, Finland and
Denmark.
   Barry Renfrew, chief of bureau in Seoul, South Korea, since 1987,
has been appointed as Torchia's successor in South Africa.
   Kelly Smith Tunney, who has held several AP news and executive
positions, most recently as a news correspondent on the Seoul staff,
succeeds Renfrew.
   Torchia replaces Larry Gerber, whose appointment as assistant
chief of bureau in Los Angeles was announced earlier.
   A 21-year veteran of the AP's foreign service, Torchia, 52,
joined the AP in New York in 1961, and worked in London before
serving as chief of bureau in Nairobi, Kenya; Lisbon, Portugal; and
Johannesburg.
   A native of Lancaster, Pa., he is a graduate of Yale University.
   Renfrew, 35, began his career with the AP as a newsman on the
General Desk in New York in 1978. He also worked in the Charleston,
W.Va., bureau. His first foreign assignment was to the staff in
Sydney, Australia, in 1983. He was chief of bureau in Islamabad,
Pakistan, before his most recent assignment to Korea.
   Born in London, he is a graduate of Clark University in
Worcester, Mass.
   Before her assignment in Seoul in 1988, Mrs. Tunney, 49, was an
assistant general manager and director of corporate communications
for the AP in New York. She had previously held a variety of news
and administrative posts. She has been assistant personnel manager,
director of media relations, director of corporate relations, a
correspondent in Vietnam in 1967 and a newswoman in New York,
Washington and Los Angeles.
   A native of New York City and graduate of the University of
Kansas, she joined the AP in Miami in 1962.

<HEAD>Angolan Guerrilla Leader Goes Back to War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-backed guerrilla leader Jonas
Savimbi ordered his fighters back to the battlefield in Angola on
Thursday, ending a fractured truce that was the country's latest
hope in a 14-year-old civil war.
   The rebel leader accused Angolan government troops of launching a
big military offensive against his fighters in southern Angola on
Aug. 17.
   ``The Angolan people, to their infinite sorrow, accept that the
war has restarted,'' Savimbi said in a statement issued from his
southern Angolan stronghold of Jamba and released in Lisbon.
   His announcement comes the day after seven of the African leaders
who helped broker Angola's June 24 cease-fire ended a meeting in
Harare, Zimbabwe, to try to put the fractured peace process back on
track.
   Cuban-backed Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos sealed the
truce with Savimbi at a summit of 18 African leaders at Gbadolite,
Zaire.
   The rebel leader Thursday also said his National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola ``rejected in the most violent terms''
a communique released by the leaders who met in Harare.
   In it, they supported dos Santos' claim that Savimbi agreed at
the Gbadolite summit to accept ``temporary and voluntary
retirement'' during cease-fire and peace negotiations, and that his
guerrillas would be integrated into the existing Angolan political
structure.
   Savimbi says he would never agree to leave Angola and wants peace
on condition dos Santos holds elections leading to a power-sharing
arrangement.
   The rebel leader never has had the opportunity to test his
popularity at the polls. His followers have been at war since
Portuguese colonizers hastily withdrew from the country in 1975,
leaving rival groups to fight for power.
   Angolan government and rebel delegates have held sporadic talks
in Zaire to try to resolve their differences since the cease-fire.
   The United States, which gives Savimbi between $15 million and
$18 million in aid a year, said Wednesday it had expected another
round of talks in Zaire shortly.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said national
reconciliation in Angola only can be achieved by direct negotiations
between the two sides and siad Washington has urged both parties to
progress on the central issue of how to achieve reconciliation.
   A major U.S. oil company is among several international concerns
that have interests in the oil- and mineral-rich nation and stand to
benefit from peace there.
   The Angolan peace process followed U.S.-brokered international
accords signed in New York by which South Africa pledged to halt aid
to Savimbi and allow Angola's southern neighbor, Namibia, to gain
independence. In return, Cuba began a phased withdrawal of its
estimated 50,000 troops from Angola.

   The State Department urged South Africa on
Thursday to exercise restraint in dealing with demonstrations by
blacks opposed to its apartheid racial policies.
   The department said that recent waves of arrests of opposition
leaders could endanger an emerging trend toward negotiations between
the white minority and black majority.
   The statement was prompted by several weeks of clashes between
authorities and anti-apartheid groups that launched a defiance
campaign Aug. 2 to end the segregation of hospitals, schools,
beaches and other facilities.
   On Thursday, police in Cape Town fired tear gas at hundreds of
protesting university students and arrested 22 white women from a
civil rights group. Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a Nobel Peace
Prize winner, was tear-gassed Wednesday when police broke up a
protest.
   ``We call on all parties in South Africa to reject the continuing
cycle of violence,'' the statement said. ``One of the tragic results
of this violence has been that now, soon after large numbers of
detainees had been released, the government has begun to rearrest
key opposition leaders.''
   The announcement said that events in South Africa ``serve to
underline the need, which we have long advocated, for the government
to allow all sides to freely voice their opposition.
   ``We again urge the South African government to create a climate
in which real negotiations with legitimate black leaders can take
place.
   ``All sides should avoid actions that may reduce the chances for
an early start to negotiations. We call on the South African
government to exercise maximum restraint in the use of force against
peaceful political protesters,'' it said.

   Police fired tear gas at hundreds
of protesting university students Thursday and arrested 22 white
women from a civil rights group in a crackdown on a nationwide
defiance campaign.
   Police reported widespread rioting linked to the campaign.
   Officers used birdshot, rubber bullets, whips and tear gas to
disperse protesters and rioters in 10 black and mixed-race townships
near Cape Town, police said.
   Crowds threw stones, hurled firebombs and set street barricades
alight, they said.
   Six officers were injured and seven people were arrested over a
24-hour period, police said.
   Anti-apartheid leaders coordinating the defiance campaign accused
the government of distorting their intentions and challenged Acting
President F.W. de Klerk to a nationally televised debate. There was
no immediate response from de Klerk's office to the challenge,
announced at a news conference in Johannesburg.
   The white women, members of the Black Sash civil rights
organization, stood in a market square in central Cape Town holding
posters supporting the defiance campaign.
   Police declared the demonstration illegal and ordered the women
to disperse. When they refused to leave, they were led into a police
bus.
   About 200 black and white bystanders cheered in support of the
women, among them Mary Burton, the president of Black Sash.
   At the University of Cape Town, 1,000 students, both black and
white, marched across a highway bordering the campus before being
dispersed by police using whips and tear gas.
   Many students regrouped and marched back to the campus behind a
protester carrying the black, green and gold flag of the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Police headquarters described the marchers as ``aggressive,
rioting students'' and said an officer was struck by a stone. The
marchers had demanded the lifting of a ban on a militant student
group.
   Since anti-apartheid groups launched the defiance campaign on
Aug. 2, there have been almost daily confrontations between police
and demonstrators in the Cape Town area.
   Police have broken up many protests, often with tear gas, and
detained dozens of activists. Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a
Nobel Peace Prize winner, was among those tear-gassed at a
demonstration on Wednesday.
   Tutu on Thursday described the police account of the incident as
a ``blatant lie,'' insisting he had emerged from a church before
tear gas was fired without warning at protesters outside. Police
said Tutu was inside at the time and that a warning was issued.
   Tutu also recounted his efforts to defuse volatile confrontations
between police and protesters, and demanded that police retract an
allegation that he encouraged illegal actions.
   The defiance campaign is aimed at ending segregation of
hospitals, schools, neighborhoods, beaches and other facilities.

   The government allowed 108 East Germans
who took refuge in the West German Embassy to leave Hungary on
Thursday and they arrived in West Germany, officials said.
   Diplomatic sources said at least 190 others crossed the border
into Austria illegally on Thursday.
   Up to 5,000 East Germans have reportedly reached the West by way
of Hungary, almost all of them illegally, since the exodus began in
mid-July.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn said 150,000 to 200,000 East Germans
are in Hungary now, and the official MTI news agency quoted him as
telling reporters an increasing number of them do not want to return
home.
   Hungary, one of the most liberal Soviet bloc nations, began
removing barbed wire and other obstacles from its frontier with
Austria in May.
   The strict East German regime seldom lets its citizens travel to
the West, but they have been able to visit neighboring Hungary with
ease.
   The Bonn-based Die Welt newspaper said Thursday that East Germany
plans to impose strict new travel regulations to Hungary as of Sept.
1 to stem the refugee flow.
   The East German Foreign Ministry called it ``an outright lie.''
   The state-run news agency ADN quoted a ministry official as
saying, ``These lies and fabrications are being spread in Cold War
style to create confusion and to slander East Germany. The truth is
that travel to Hungary as well as to Bulgaria and Romania continues
as usual.''
   The 108 East Germans were allowed to travel West, with documents
provided by the International Red Cross, ``on the basis of
humanitarian considerations,'' MTI said.
   Austrian radio quoted Austrian Red Cross officials as saying the
International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva organized the
transfer in response to a request from Bonn.
   The group flew to Vienna, the Austrian capital, on a chartered
flight and then continued by bus to West Germany, the officials said.
   Horn said Hungary was not interested in any increase in the
number of East Germans staying here or ``in transit.'' He said
Hungary views this a problem that must be solved by the two Germanys.
   Witnesses confirmed reports that Hungarian border guards
intercepted a group of about 150 East Germans who traveled to the
border in three buses and three taxis Wednesday.
   One escaper, who gave his name only as Lothar K., told The
Associated Press about 50 guards used truncheons to disperse the
group as they tried to walk toward the border with arms linked to
protect women and children.
   ``I never imagined something like that could happen,'' he said on
Thursday.
   He and his wife and child hid in the bushes throughout the night
and then furtively crossed the border at daybreak, he said.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said many
others later escaped across the border at another point.
   Few reports of border violence have surfaced since the exodus
began. The shooting death Monday of an East German who struggled
with a Hungarian border guard was deemed an accident by Hungarian
and Austrian officials Thursday.
   A group of four young East Germans who fled to Austria Thursday
said a guard who caught them indicated when he sent them back that
he would look away if they tried again. A few hours later they tried
again and succeeded, with no guard in sight.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee Wants Investment Executive to Testify</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A House panel investigating favoritism and
mismanagement in federal housing programs was in a standoff with
Paine Webber Inc. Thursday over whether the company's chief
executive officer will be called to testify next month.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the House Government
Operations housing subcommittee, invited Donald B. Marron, chief
executive officer of the investment firm, to testify on Sept. 27
about the firm's consulting arrangements with the Department of
Housing and Urban Development.
   In a letter dated Tuesday, Lantos said questions about Paine
Webber's involvement had been raised during the panel's
investigation of Lance Wilson, a first vice president of Paine
Webber and a former HUD official. Wilson has been subpoenaed to
testify at the Sept. 27 hearing.
   ``In your testimony please describe the results of your internal
study of the firm's involvement with HUD, company policy on
influence peddling by its employees to secure contracts, and
limitations on outside consulting work by Paine Webber employees,''
Lantos wrote.
   Paine Webber said earlier this month it had opened an
investigation of its dealings with HUD.
   In a statement issued Wednesday in New York, Paine Webber said,
``The appropriate person to testify is James C. Treadway Jr., our
general counsel, and we have so suggested to the subcommittee.''
   Andrea Nelson, a spokeswoman for the subcommittee, said the
panel's staff director, Stuart Weisberg, talked with Treadway by
telephone on Wednesday and told him it would be up to Lantos to
decide whether he would still like to have Marron appear.
   Lantos is traveling in Eastern Europe and Ms. Nelson said he
could not immediately be reached.
   Wilson said through his lawyer on Wednesday that he had gone on
administrative leave with pay, at his request.
   The company's statement said, ``Our decision to grant Mr. Wilson
the leave in no way implies any wrongdoing on his part of Paine
Webber's.''
   Wilson, who was executive assistant to former HUD Secretary
Samuel R. Pierce Jr., cited his Fifth Amendment right against self
incrimination in refusing to testify before the panel last week.

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias said Thursday
they had united against a French flotilla off Lebanon, and the
radical Hezbollah faction said its response will ``horrify
everybody'' if the warships approach.
   Hezbollah did not say what it would do, but has threatened
suicide attacks on Western targets and is believed to sponsor Shiite
gangs that hold most of the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Police said one person was killed and three were wounded in
shelling along the line that divides the capital into Moslem west
Beirut and the Christian eastern sector.
   Skirmishes along the line have occurred daily since an artillery
war began March 8 between the 20,000 men of Gen. Michel Aoun's
Christian army command and a Moslem alliance led by the 40,000
Syrian soldiers stationed in Lebanon. By police count, 791 people
have been killed and 2,208 wounded.
   A senior Soviet official drove from Damascus, Syria, for talks
with Moslem and Christian on deadlocked efforts to end the fighting
and ease tension over the French naval buildup in the eastern
Mediterranean.
   Lebanese military sources said some French vessels were cruising
40 miles off Lebanon, ``distant from commercial shipping lanes.''
   The aircraft carrier Foch, with 2,000 marines aboard, leads the
task force. The French say it is on ``hmanitarian mission,'' to
evacuate the 7,000 French citizens in Lebanon if necessary.
   Syria and its allies claim France, which governed Lebanon from
the end of World War I until 1943, is allying itself with the
Christians. Syrian troops have been in Lebanon since 1976, a year
after the civil war began, under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Ali Akbar Velayati, the foreign minister of Iran, sent a message
to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar asking for
``urgent and decisive measures to prevent this ... provocative
military interference and keep the Frnech fleet away from Lebanese
territorial waters.''
   Hezbollah and Amal, a more moderate Shiite militia allied with
Syria, have fought a bloody power struggle for 16 months, but said
Thursday they were joining forces against ``this
American-Israeli-French plot.''
   Their declaration followed a meeting in Tyre, 50 miles south of
Beirut, with Abbas Mousawi of Hezbollah and Amal chieftain Nabih
Berri as joint chairmen.
   Mousawi said afterward: ``We can confront this ... plot only if
our ranks were consolidated. This danger threatens all of us.''
   ``We're facing the threat of Lebanon's partition,'' he said.
``France has declared its support of the partitioning of Lebanon.''
   He waved a clenched fist in the air and said: ``Our battle will
horrify everybody!''
   Berri said: ``The war between Amal and Hezbollah is over for
good. We tell France ... that we will certainly strike at the French
force if it approaches our coasts.''
   Police say 575 people have been killed and more than 1,550
wounded in the Amal-Hezbollah war for supremacy among the 1 million
Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect.
   Hezbollah has threatened suicide attacks against Western targets
if France tries to help the Christians.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, which holds American
hostages Joseph Cicippio and Edward Tracy, both 58, has said French
involvement would endanger their lives.
   Six more Americans are among the hostages, but no French captives
now are being held. The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   Gennady Tarasov, the Soviet envoy, met in west Beirut with acting
Premier Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who leads a Moslem Cabinet
competing for power with Aoun's Christian government.
   Tarasov also conferred with Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini,
a Shiite, and planned to meet with Christian leaders in east Beirut.
He heads the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Middle East department.
   In Damascus, Tarasov met with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
Syria is Moscow's main Arab ally.
   Also Thursday, more than 100 Lebanese refugees in Limassol,
Cyprus, lined up to donate blood for casualties of the Lebanese
fighting. The Lebanese community on the east Mediterranean island
has swollen to more than 20,000 through the influx of refugees.
   In Venezuela, the lower house of Congress asked the government to
open that country's doors to to members of Lebanon's Maronite
Christian community who want to immigrate to Venezuela, newspapers
reported.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Looks Set To Win Parliament's Backing For Cabinet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tehran newspapers said Thursday that
Hashemi Rafsanjani, the new president of Iran, will win
parliamentary approval of his new Cabinet despite opposition from
radicals to his dismissal of hard-liners.
   The Tehran Times, which often speaks for Rafsanjani, said his
government choices would be approved only after ``a really sizzling
debate,'' scheduled to begin Sunday.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the
English-language daily as saying the debate could last three days.
   Hojatoleslam Hussein Sobhaninia, a senior member of the Majlis,
the 270-seat parliament, said a ``large number'' of deputies had
decided to support Rafsanjani's 22-man slate as a demonstration of
national unity, the paper said.
   ``All agreed that the proposed ministers should get clearance
from the Majlis, said Sobhaninia, a member of the Foreign Policy
Committee, according to the Tehran Times report.
   Noting that Iraq still occupies Iranian territory despite the
truce declared a year ago in the eight-year war, Sobhaninia said:
``If all the proposed ministers receive votes of confidence, it will
be another slap in the face of our enemies.''
   Former President Ali Khamenei, who became spiritual leader after
the death June 3 of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, urged the Majlis on
Wednesday to set aside political differences and support Rafsanjani.
   Khamenei told the deputies they should ``vote on competence
alone'' rather than ``differences of taste or God forbid, personal
matters.''
   Khamenei, Rafsanjani and others generally considered pragmatists
have denied a power struggle followed Khomeini's death, but the
Khamenei appeal underlined opposition to Rafsanjani's policies and
the ministers he has chosen.
   Radicals have considerable influence in parliament, where
Rafsanjani was replaced as speaker by Mehdi Karrubi, who was his
deputy and advocates the vilent spread of Khomeini's Islamic
revolution.
   Rafsanjani favors openings to the West to end Iran's isolation
and attract aid and foreign investment. He also seeks to liberalize
the economy, long constrained by tight state control under Prime
Minister Hussein Musavi, whose job was abolished by the new
constitution.

<HEAD>Leftist Opposition Says 28 Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small leftist opposition group claimed
Thursday the security forces arrested 28 men in dawn raids and
accused them of forming a communist party.
   In Egypt, communist parties are illegal but personal belief in
communism is accepted.
   The Moscow-oriented National Unionist Progressive Party issued a
statement saying those arrested, most from its own ranks, had
sympathized with a workers' sit-in Aug. 2 at Egypt's largest metal
plant. Police stormed the plant and a worker was killed.
   There was no comment from the Interior Ministry, which is in
charge of police, but the official Middle East News Agency said
authorities were questioning members of a clandestine organization
arrested early Thursday.
   It said said tracts ``inciting change in the country's social and
political systems'' were found and the organization called itself
the ``Egyptian Communist Workers' Party.'' The agency said there
were 52 members, including three journalists and three lawyers.
   According to the opposition party, the 28 men were arrested hours
before a news conference was to be held at the Bar Association about
the strike at the steel plant at Helwan, south of Cairo.
   ``State security officials have accused them of forming an
underground organization called the Communist Workers' Party,'' the
statement said.
   At Helwan, a worker was shot to death and two policemen and 14
strikers were injured. Security forces arrested more than 600
workers, but said most were released soon afterward, and work
resumed the next day.
   The National Unionist Progressive Party has said about 300
workers are missing and believed still in custody. The workers
struck for better pay and working conditions.

   The State Department said Thursday it has no
immediate plans to evacuate U.S. government personnel from Colombia
in the aftermath of bombings by drug traffickers, but acknowledged
``a very concrete threat'' exists against the Bogota government.
   The drug traffickers' declaration of war on the Colombian
government ``certainly heightens the concern about security, both
for the Colombian government and for ourselves,'' State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   ``It dramatizes, I would say, what we've long known, and that's
that these drug traffickers represent a very concrete threat to the
institutions of the government of Colombia,'' he said.
   However, there are no plans to withdraw any U.S. personnel in
Colombia, and, without such a plan the government would not even
necessarily pay for travel of those U.S. dependents who want to
leave, he said.
   The embassy has ``always been on a high state of readiness,''
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday. ``That
continues.''
   There are some 100 U.S. officials with the embassy in Bogota and
about two dozen Drug Enforcement Administration agents in the
country, according to officials.
   No Americans were hurt in the attacks early Thursday in Medellin
_ home to the world's largest cocaine cartel _ and the embassy in
Bogota ``was not aware of any bombings'' until diplomats heard
reports on Colombian radio, another State Department official said.
   The United States formerly maintained a consulate in Medellin,
but closed it in the early 1980s ``due to the threat,'' a State
Department official said.
   Colombia is a danger post, meaning that U.S. diplomats posted
there receive extra money to compensate for the risk, and minor
dependents are not allowed.
   Meanwhile, administration and military sources reported that the
Joint Chiefs of Staff decided Thursday to draw up a ``laundry list''
of military hardware for President Bush to consider sending to
Colombia in the event that nation requests such material.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said
the list sent to the White House included UH-1 ``Huey'' troop
transport helicopters, ammunition, and radio equipment, the military
sources said.
   ``No personnel is involved,'' one source said, indicating that
the choppers would be flown by Colombian pilots if they should be
sent.
   No precise numbers were disclosed, but the source said the
numbers were ``not extravagant.''
   The administration source said the list was not a formal
recommendation, but instead provided the president with ``a laundry
list of items that the Pentagon could provide if called upon to do
so.''
   The source noted that the president has strictly ruled out the
use of U.S. military troops, which is in line with the Joint Chiefs'
thinking.
   Last weekend, the Colombian government imposed a state of siege
following a string of killings that culminated in the assassination
of Luis Carlos Galan, a leading presidential candidate and an
outspoken foe of drug traffickers.
   The state of siege allows for quick extraditions of alleged drug
traffickers wanted on U.S. charges, extraditions that ended abruptly
in 1987 when the Colombian Supreme Court, under pressure from
traffickers, overturned the extradition agreement. The traffickers
have indicated that extradition is one of their major concerns due
to their fears that they would not be able to escape as they have in
Colombia.
   President Bush, contacted at the summer White House in
Kennebunkport, Maine, said he had ``no real comment'' on the
situation in Colombia.
   ``There will be meetings with the proper Colombian officials in
the not so many hours,'' Bush said as he prepared to meet the
visiting prime minister of Denmark.
   The Justice Department anounced Wednesday an agreement to offer
Colombia $2 million for a judicial protection program, part of the
$5 million authorized by Congress for such a program last year.
Dozens of judges have been killed, and most of the slayings have
been traced to the drug cartels.
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said plans for the
program had been under discussion since April, and that one reason
the entire $5 million wasn't allocated was to give officials a
chance to determine where the money could best be spent.
   Boucher said an additional $500,000 was being allocated to
purchase security equipment, although he did not specify what kind
of equipment.
   Colombian Justice Minister Monica de Greiff was quoted in
Thursday's Washington Post as saying that the U.S. embassy refused
to allow the Colombian government to use some of the money to buy
armored cars.
   However, a State Department official said the purchase of armored
cars is one of the things being considered for the remaining $2.5
million.
   ``It's in our interests for their judges not to be blown up
getting from home to work and back,'' the official said.
   The Colombian government has arrested some 11,000 people since
the state of siege began, but the only U.S. officials have said they
want to extradite is Eduardo Martinez Romero, an alleged money
launderer for the Medellin cartel who was indicted in March in
Atlanta.
   The embassy has relayed a request for Martinez's arrest, which
enables the Colombians to hold him for 30 days on behalf of the
United States, according to Boucher, and an administration source
said the extradition paperwork was being completed.
   A U.S. government plane has been at the Bogota airport since last
weekend and could be used to transport Martinez to the United States
for trial on the charges filed in Atlanta in March, according to the
source.

<HEAD>Planned Language Law Sparks Strike in Soviet Moldavia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at more than 90 factories in the eastern
Soviet republic of Moldavia went on strike Thursday to protest a
proposed language law that ethnic Russians fear will discriminate
against them, official media said.
   The Moldavian Supreme Soviet, or legislature, is scheduled to
vote on the bill making Moldavian the republic's official language
on Tuesday.
   The Workers' Alliance of Moldavia, which claims to represent
workers in 192 businesses, met in the republic's capital of Kishinev
and Wednesday voted in favor of a protest strike, the Tass news
agency said.
   More than 50 factories in Kishinev, Bendery, Rybnitysa, Komrat
and other cities in the Soviet republic bordering Romania walked off
the job Thursday, Tass said.
   They joined a work stoppage begun Monday by mostly ethnic Russian
workers in Tiraspol, Moldavia's second-largest city where Russians
are in the majority.
   State Radio Moscow said 40 businesses in Tiraspol have been
closed by the strike.
   The strikers are demanding that the draft language law not be
adopted before widespread public discussion in the republic of 4.2
million people and before the election of a new Supreme Soviet in
the spring.
   They fear making Moldavian the republic's official language will
be a first step toward discrimination against Russians and other
migrants.
   Earlier this month, tens of thousands of ethnic Russian workers
living in Estonia went on strike to protest a law that set the
Soviet Union's first residency requirements for voting and running
for office.
   The Soviet Presidium, the nation's top executive body, ruled the
Estonian law was a violation of the Soviet Constitution.

   Two Japanese TV networks on Thursday began regular
broadcasts using a new television system that provides clearer
pictures to special sets but can still be viewed on regular sets.
   The system, called extended-definition television, or EDTV,
produces more detailed pictures with deeper colors and fewer
``ghosts'' on sets equipped with special circuitry.
   EDTV will compete against another new high-quality TV system,
called high-definition television. HDTV provides sharper images but
involves a more radical redesign of TV standards and in some cases
is incompatible with present equipment.
   Nippon Television Network said it will broadcast 5-6 hours of
EDTV programs a day. The TBS network said it will begin with about
three hours a week. Other networks in Japan are expected to begin
EDTV broadcasts this month or in September.
   ``We decided to begin EDTV broadcasting because of our interest
in improving picture quality and because of its better compatibility
with current equipment,'' said a TBS official on condition of
anonymity.
   Many broadcasters see EDTV as a more practical alternative to
HDTV, which requires a greater investment by stations and consumers.
Current HDTV monitors in Japan sell for about $60,000. EDTV sets are
available for about $2,800.
   The TV system in common use in North America and Japan divides
the picture into 525 horizontal lines, though not all the lines
appear on the screen at once. First odd-numbered lines are scanned,
and then one-60th of a second later the even lines appear, producing
30 combined images each second.
   The speed is too fast for the human eye to detect, but it creates
a flicker and fuzziness that is particularly noticeable on large
screens and in scenes with rapid motion.
   EDTV uses special cameras that scan all 525 lines at once. It
transmits a reference signal letting TV sets detect and reduce
ghosts, or double signals reflected from buildings or other objects.

   Farouk Kaddoumi, the PLO's equivalent of a
foreign minister, was quoted in an interview published Thursday as
offering to negotiate peace with Israel.
   Farouk Kaddoumi also said the current PLO dialogue with the
United States would not lead to a Middle East settlement, according
to the report in Al Qoda (Jerusalem), an Arabic-language weekly
based in London.
   It said the interview was conducted in Tunis, where the Palestine
Liberation Organization has its headquarters.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel has proposed elections in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where a Palestinian uprising
began more than 20 months ago, to choose representatives who would
negotiate with Israel.
   The PLO insists that elections be held only under international
supervision, after Israeli withdrawal from the territories.
   ``Washington is trying to give Shamir more time to liquidate the
uprising or enforce Shamir's election plan,'' Kaddoumi was quoted as
saying.
   ``It is not possible for Washington to alter its political stance
unless it feels that its interests are in danger and it must respond
to the Palestinian demands.''
   ``Any dialogue with Israeli forces must be held outside the
occupied territories,'' he said. ``There are Israeli occupation
authorities imposing their will on the Palestinian people, and local
leaders in the occupied territories are under various political and
psychological pressures.
   ``This is why talks with Israeli forces must be held outside the
occupied territories and we are ready for such a dialogue.''
   He said of low-level talks with the United States being held in
Tunis: ``We must not have any illusion that the dialogue with the
United States would achieve the aspired results.''
   In December, after PLO chief Yasser Arafat publicly renounced
terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist, the United States
ended a 13-year ban on dealings with the PLO and the talks began.

   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across the middle
Mississippi and lower Ohio valleys Thursday along a stationary front
dividing very warm and humid air from mild and drier air prevailing
in the Northeast.
   High pressure in the upper atmosphere centered over northern
Florida, helping carry moisture into the lower Mississippi Valley,
and showers and thunderstorms blossomed across the region.
   The heaviest rainfall was in southwest Louisiana and southeast
Texas, where nearly an inch of rain fell at Beaumont and Port
Arthur, Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms moved into eastern Tennessee, northern
Georgia and the western Carolinas, with gusty winds blowing down
trees in Clinton County, S.C.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed in the high plains of
Colorado and New Mexico.
   Rainshowers were scattered across northern and central Plateau,
with temperatures in the 40s and 50s from western Montana, Idaho and
eastern Washington south into northern Utah and northeast Nevada.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 3 p.m. EDT
included nearly an inch and a half in the Indianapolis area and
nearly an inch at Bristol, Tenn.
   The low temperature in the lower 48 states Thursday morning was
30 degrees at South Lake Tahoe, Nev., and Burney, Calif. At 2 p.m.
EDT the low was 42 degrees at McCall, Idaho, and the high 99 degrees
at Fort Smith, Ariz., and Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota.
   Friday's national forecast called for showers and thunderstorms
scattered from the lower Missouri and middle Mississippi valleys
through the lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys into the southern
Atlantic Coast region.
   Afternoon and evening thundershowers will develop across the
central and eastern Gulf Coast through northern and central Florida.
Thunderstorms are also expected across parts of west Texas.
   Showers will be widespread from the northern Rockies into the
northern Plains, with high temperatures in the 70s or 80s across
much of the nation.
   Highs will be in the 60s over the northern Rockies and much of
Maine; in the 90s from the southern Plains and Texas into the
southeastern quarter of the nation; in the 90s to near 105 degrees
from the desert Southwest into southern Arizona and southern New
Mexico.

<HEAD>Personality Traits in Compulsive Gamblers Linked to Biological Factors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some compulsive gamblers' personality traits _
particularly their tendency to enjoy risks and seek sensation _
partly may reflect disturbances in their central nervous systems, a
new study says.
   Other experts who work with gamblers say many factors, including
childhood experience, can play a part in explaining the urge to bet.
   Researchers who wrote the study, published in the August issue of
the American Medical Association's Archives of General Psychiatry,
examined body fluids from 17 compulsive gamblers and found high
levels of certain chemical reactions in their nervous systems.
   The researchers also found that on a written personality test,
the gamblers had high scores for ``extraversion,'' the tendency to
be outgoing, physically and socially active and to take risks.
   Researchers looked at chemicals taken from blood, urine and
spinal fluid that indicated activity in the body's noradrenergic
system, which governs such diverse processes as the funtioning of
organs and communications between nerve cells in the brain.
   Subjects were 17 men with a mean age of 36 who had met the
psychiatric definition of compulsive gambler and participated as
inpatients at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.
   The study, led by Dr. Alec Roy, who has since left NIH, did not
indicate when the research was done and Roy could not be reached by
telephone Thursday.
   ``What's most important about the article is that people are
beginning to realize that compulsive gambling is an illness, which
is something I don't think Pete Rose is ready to admit,'' said Dr.
Paul Fink, medical director of the Philadelphia Psychiatric Center,
which runs a treatment program for pathological gamblers.
   Rose, manager of the Cincinnati Reds, was banned for life from
major league baseball Thursday for allegations that he bet on his
own team. Rose denies the charges.
   Fink, however, cautioned that scientists don't know whether
gambling for years raises the levels of certain chemical activity in
compulsive bettors, or the elevated levels tend to make people seek
thrills like gambling.
   ``We're dealing with a chicken-and-egg, which-came-first
phenomenon,'' he said. ``It's hard to base a concept that affects
thousands of people on 17 cases.''
   Durand F. Jacobs, a board member of the New York-based National
Council on Compulsive Gambling, a research, training and referral
group, agreed.
   ``I think the research ... is very important, but it needs
further testing and verification,'' Jacobs said by telephone from
Loma Linda, Calif., where he is psychology director of a Veterans
Administration hospital.
   Jacobs said his own theory, based on 30 years of research into
addictions, is that besides whatever biological conditions exist,
``all addicts have had a childhood where they've been subject to
experiences that make them feel inferior. ... They feel inadequate,
and no matter what they do it's never enough.''
   Dr. Richard J. Rosenthal, a pyschiatrist at the University of
California at Los Angeles, said he has found a close association
between compulsive gambling and outstanding athletes.
   ``Being people who are drawn to action and activity as a way of
dealing with problems, a way of soothing and comforting themselves,
it is very natural for them to be attracted to sports,'' he said.
   Jean Falzon, executive director of the compulsive gambling
council, said the study should not be used as an excuse by gamblers.
   ``People are responsible for their behavior,'' she said by
telephone from her Pennsylvania home.

   A graying and glib Paul McCartney formally
announced an international concert tour Thursday that he hoped would
attract both misty-eyed Beatlemaniacs and a new generation of fans.
   ``There was a time when you thought music equals youth. I don't
think that applies anymore,'' said McCartney, 47, joining other
middle-aged rockers on tour this year _ the Who, the Rolling Stones
and former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr.
   Asked if he was touring to avoid being ``left out,'' he replied,
``I suppose there's an element of that ... but it's not my prime
reason for going out.''
   Instead, he credited the endless touring of the Grateful Dead and
its leader, Jerry Garcia, with inspiring his first tour since 1976.
``If Jerry can still do it that good, there's hope for us all,''
McCartney said.
   McCartney also said several nieces and nephews have asked him:
``Please play, because we weren't there the first time around.''
   McCartney let reporters watch the end of his new band's rehearsal
at the Lyceum Theater in Manhattan, then answered questions about
the tour, his band and new record, ``Flowers in the Dirt,'' and the
Beatles.
   Band members include Linda McCartney on keyboards and vocals;
Hamish Stuart, a guitarist and bassist from the Average White Band;
guitarist Robbie McIntosh, formerly of the Pretenders; drummer Chris
Witten and keyboardist-computer programmer Wix.
   McCartney said his show would draw from four distinct phases of
his 33-year career: pre-Beatles rock 'n' roll; Beatles songs;
greatest hits from his years with Wings, and songs from the new
album.
   Among the Beatles tunes will be selections from ``Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' their landmark 1967 album.
   ``We never got to do it with the Beatles,'' McCartney said,
noting that the album was done entirely in the studio, after the
group had stopped performing live.
   Also on the proposed set list: ``Hey Jude.''
   ``I'm hoping for a little audience participation on that one _
the na-na-na at the end,'' he said.
   The tour opens with three shows at the Los Angeles Forum Nov.
27-28-29. Other confirmed dates: Chicago, Dec. 3-4-5; Toronto, Dec.
7; Montreal, Dec. 9; New York, Dec. 11-12-14-15.
   Other North American dates will be announced later, but the band
plans to play Boston, Philadelphia, Detroit, Seattle, Dallas and San
Francisco.
   McCartney said the band will return to North America in February
``to cover the cities we missed.''

<HEAD>Government Suspends Parliament To Avoid No-Confidence Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISTER HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Herbert Blaize's
government suspended Parliament on Thursday amid opposition threats
to bring it down with a no-confidence vote.
   Blaize, 71, has been under intense pressure over what critics
call an increasingly authoritarian style and in January lost
leadership of his party.
   Thursday's announcement means Blaize can govern without any
parliamentary opposition until as late as February, a month before
general elections are due.
   Opposition leader George Brizan accused Blaize of treating
Parliament with ``ridicule and contempt'' during the Caribbean
island's most serious political crisis since the leftist revolution
and subsequent U.S.-led invasion of 1983.
   Brizan was notified by letter that the legislature, which was to
convene Friday after a recess, is being suspended for an indefinite
period.
   Under Grenada's constitution, the governor general of this former
British colony can suspend Parliament at any time for up to six
months.
   Because general elections must be held by March 28, it appears
unlikely a no-confidence vote can be introduced.
   In January, Blaize lost leadership of the governing New National
Party to his popular public works minister, Keith Mitchell, 43.
   The prime minister subsequently fired Mitchell from his Cabinet
and two other Cabinet ministers resigned in protest. Blaize opposes
Mitchell's wish for a broad coalition to include members of the
ousted Marxist government.
   The New National Party now holds nine of the 15 seats in
Parliament and Brizan's National Democratic Congress has the other
six. In a no-confidence vote, Mitchell and the two other former
Cabinet ministers were expected to side with the oppositon, causing
the government to fall.
   ``This confirms my view that the prime minister is not behaving
like the person I knew in 1984 when he won the elections,'' Mitchell
said Thursday. ``He now seems to put the will of the people last and
his personal position and pique first.''
   Blaize became prime minister on Dec. 3, 1984, 14 months after
U.S. troops and a small Caribbean force invaded the island to topple
a Marxist junta that seized power in a bloody coup.

<HEAD>Woman Says Driver Made Her Sit At Back Of Bus Because She's Black</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ A woman and her two children have
filed a lawsuit claiming that a Greyhound bus driver forced them to
sit at the back of his bus on a transcontinental trip because they
are black.
   Vickie H. Hairston of Winston-Salem sued Greyhound Lines Inc.
last week in Forsyth Superior Court on behalf of herself and her
children, Jemithra and Joy Hairston.
   The lawsuit alleges that Greyhound officials knew about what it
calls the ``racial feelings'' of the driver and allowed him to
continue working.
   The lawsuit asked for more than $30,000 in compensatory and
punitive damages stemming from the 1986 incident.
   ``These kinds of cases are rare anymore,'' said Romallus O.
Murphy, an attorney from Greensboro who is representing Mrs.
Hairston with the help of the NAACP. ``All of the case law is from
the early 1970s and 1960s.''
   It has been 34 years since Rosa Parks helped ignite the
civil-rights movement by refusing to move to the back of a city bus
in Montgomery, Ala.
   The lawsuit says that Mrs. Hairston and her two children boarded
a Greyhound bus in Winston-Salem on Aug. 15, 1986, bound for
Portland, Ore. At the time, Jemithra was 11 years old and Joy was 4.
   While they were traveling from Cheyenne, Wyo., to Rawlins, Wyo.,
the lawsuit says, the bus driver, identified as Joe Kant, began
harassing Mrs. Hairston and her children. It says that the only
reason for the harassment was their race.
   At Rawlins, the lawsuit says, Kant told them that they would have
to sit at the back of the bus. When they refused, they ``were
informed that if they did not move to the rear of the bus, they must
seek other transportation,'' the lawsuit says.
   The lawsuit said that ``despite the support (for the Hairstons)
of white passengers and a police officer from the Rawlins police
force, the driver insisted ... (and that) in great fear for their
health and safety (they) moved to the rear of the bus as demanded.''
   Many passengers on the bus have written to Mrs. Hairston and
volunteered to testify for her if she took legal action, Murphy
said. She did not file a lawsuit until now because she has little
money and was uncertain about how to proceed, he said.
   The lawsuit says that the incident caused Mrs. Hairston great
emotional strain and even caused an attack of skin lesions because
she suffers from lupus, a skin disease.
   The lawsuit does not name Kant as a defendant. It demands at
least $10,000 from Greyhound for breach of contract, at least
$10,000 for negligence, and at least $10,000 for intentionally
inflicting emotional distress on the Hairstons.
   There is some confusion, however, over who is being sued, because
the Greyhound bus-lines divisions was split off from the parent
company and sold in March 1987. The lawsuit says that it is suing
Greyhound Lines Inc., a corporation in Phoenix, Ariz.
   The company now in Phoenix is called The Greyhound Corporation.
Brad Parker, a spokesman for that company, said officials there know
nothing about the lawsuit.
   Greyhound Lines Inc. of Dallas, Texas, now owns the bus
operations. Elizabeth Hale, a spokesman for that company, said the
company would not be legally responsible for any incident that
occurred before it bought the bus service.
   Murphy said that he filed the lawsuit against the company that
sold the tickets to Mrs. Hairston.

   A truck making a U-turn in a driveway hit a wall
that then collapsed, killing four people, including three children
from the same family, police said.
   Several pedestrians, including Carol Croucher and her four young
children, were waiting on the sidewalk for the truck to finish the
U-turn in south London when the vehicle struck the 5-foot wall,
police said.
   About three tons of masonry fell on top of them, police said.
   Ms. Croucher, 28, and her 9-year-old daughter survived, but two
daughters, aged 4 and 8, and their 8-month-old brother were killed.
Another pedestrian, Beverley Walsh, was also killed.
   The truck driver was questioned and released without charge,
police said.

   Israel offered the Colombian government help in
fighting drugs and asked it for information Thursday about Israeli
mercenaries who were said to have trained assassins for cocaine
barons.
   A Defense Ministry statement said an investigation revealed that
the ministry denied a permit more than a year ago to Hod Hahanit, a
private security company said to be involved in the training.
   Acting without a permit would be a ``serious breach of the law,''
the statement said.
   The ministry said a second Israeli firm it did not identify had
violated terms of a permit to do security work in Colombia, but that
no link to illegal activities had been established.
   Yair Tsaban, a legislator from the left-wing party Mapam,
demanded Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens and Attorney General Yosef Harish appear before the Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee to explain the involvement of Israelis
in Colombia.
   ``I want to bring up the idea of reserve officers selling weapons
and offering training,'' he said. ``We must certainly put limits to
this and check and check again how they are working.''
   Committee chairman Eliahu Ben-Elissar, of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc, said a hearing would be proposed for
next week.
   A Foreign Ministry official said privately that Israel offered
Colombia ``all possible assistance in the struggle against drug
traffic'' and asked for all information available on the involvement
of Israelis.
   He said the request was made to the Colombian Foreign Ministry by
Michael Ronen, charge d'affaires at the Israeli Embassy in Bogota.
   Israeli media said Thursday that four Israeli mercenaries trained
paramilitary troops and assassination teams for drug dealers in
Central America.
   Drug cartel assassins killed a judge, a national police colonel
and Colombia's leading presidential candidate last week.
   Israel television and all major dailies identified the head of
the training group as Lt. Col. Yair Klein, 44, retired commander of
a paratroop anti-terror squad.
   A government inquiry began after film was broadcast on American
television showing an Israeli officer instructing paramilitary
personnel who worked for drug traffickers.
   Israeli media identified Klein as the officer and said he ran Hod
Hahanit, which operated in South America. The company is listed in
the 1988 Israel Defense Sales Directory published by the Defense
Ministry.
   Its advertisement, which identifies Klein as president, says the
firm ``specializes in fighting terrorism by establishing and
training anti-terror units, internal security and intelligence
forces, sophisticated rescue teams ... presidential guard units, and
VIP security.''
   Israel television said the company began operating in Colombia
more than two years ago. It said all the company's men had left the
country and Klein was expected in Israel on Saturday.
   It said Rafael Eytan, an Israeli counterterrorism expert, denied
suggestions that he was a consultant to Israeli companies operating
in Colombia and said he had cut all business ties to that country.
   According to the report, Eytan confirmed he flew to Colombia a
week ago for private reasons.
   Benny Tal, an Israeli security expert, said former commandos and
paratroopers often are recruited by drug cartels.
   Tal, who owns a private security firm that trains bodyguards
abroad, said in an interview that Israelis often go to the United
States with dreams of making fortunes, but find themselves
unemployed.
   ``If someone from a drug cartel comes to him and offers, say,
$100,000 for a job, he'll do it,'' Tal said.
   Tal said Israelis who train illegal paramilitary forces usually
are offered $10,000 a month paid into Swiss bank accounts, plus
expenses in local currency.
   Israel TV quoted foreign reports about a possible involvement in
Colombia by Mike Harari, a former chief of Israeli intelligence in
South America and a security chief for Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Harari, Mossad's former operations chief, left the intelligence
agency after a July 1973 fiasco in Norway in which his agents
mistook a Moroccan waiter for a Palestinian terrorist and killed him.
   Israel TV quoted Zvi Zamir, head of Mossad in 1968-1974, as
saying Harari was not involved in military training in Colombia and
``one must be insane to tie Harari to drug dealings.''
   Panama's ambassador to the United States, Juan Sosa, said on
Israel radio that Harari entered the United States two weeks ago on
a false passport and may have returned to Panama.

<HEAD>Crashing Black-Tie Parties in Washington is a Cinch, Expert Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS last graf to CORRECT point; it's not possible to crash
a White House state dinner, sted it is possible.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

   Lisa McCormack says crashing an exclusive
black-tie party in Washington is easier than you think. All you need
is a tuxedo or a formal gown and plenty of chutzpah.
   She ought to know, even though she's never crashed a party
herself.
   As former editor of the ``About Town'' society pages of The
Washington Times for 5{ years, Ms. McCormack says she attended
``literally thousands'' of glitzy social events and ``interviewed
everyone from Spuds MacKenzie to Mother Teresa.''
   She's shared confidences with Shimon Peres and Francois
Mitterrand, and chatted up the likes of Malcolm Forbes, Don Johnson,
Lee Iacocca, Elizabeth Taylor and Mikhail Baryshnikov. Her Rolodex
is crammed with unlisted phone numbers for senators, foreign
ambassadors and Hollywood celebrities.
   ``What shocked me was how easy it is to crash parties in this
town,'' Ms. McCormack said in an interview after she lectured eager
students at the Learning Annex, a local university without walls, on
the rules of the party-crashing game. Ms. McCormack is now an
investigative reporter for the Times.
   Here is her how-to guide for slipping into swank parties without
an invitation and enjoying a free evening of booze, food and
schmoozing with big-name guests.
   The toughest job is finding out where the parties are and when
they begin, she says. Check newspaper society columns and magazines
for upcoming events. Call the big hotels. They publish a detailed,
mimeographed list of future parties and banquets, complete with
names and phone numbers.
   ``Call up and say, `I'm interested in attending your party. Can
you tell me who the VIPs are?' Have an agenda in mind. You are going
there for a specific purpose,'' she said.
   The rest is a cinch.
   ``If a dinner party starts at 7 o'clock, arrive 20 minutes late.
You'll see a table at the door, usually run by five women. That's
where paying guests go to check in. Avoid those women at all costs.
   ``Go directly to the bar, start chatting in the line and get a
drink. It will help you relax and give you a chance to mix and
mingle. Like me, you might run into (former Surgeon General) Everett
Koop, who drinks straight gin out of a glass. `Say it isn't so,' I
told him.
   ``Dinner usually starts about 8:30. Move through the hed into the
ballroom. They will drift slowly to the tables. When they finally
sit down, that's the time to leave and return to the bar for about
20 minutes. When you come back, there will always be empty seats, so
just take one.
   ``If you don't have the guts to take that empty seat, just skip
the meal, which takes 50 minutes max. The food is usually bad
anyway. Then it's a cocktail party again, with talking and dancing.
Walk right in and join everybody.''
   Above all, maintain a nonchalant attitude, says Ms. McCormack.
   ``Just wave at everybody and say to yourself, `I'm here, I'm
cool, I belong.' And don't freeze up.
   ``It's amazing, but nobody's going to stop you. Either they don't
care or they're afraid of embarrassing themselves if they do. I got
into the inaugural galas without showing credentials, with nothing
but my ball gown. I just waved and smiled at the security guards and
walked in.''
   Says Ms. McCormack: ``Anybody can do it.''
   She cautions against trying to crash White House state dinners,
because security is too tight to take chances.
   ``It's impossible,'' she said.

   Drug gangs bombed two political party
offices Thursday, burned the homes of two politicians in Medellin,
and declared ``total war'' on the government for cracking down on
them. One person was killed.
   President Virigilio Barco on Thursday issued a series of new
emergency decrees that heighten the nation's battle against drug
traffickers.
   The anti-narcotics sweep was spurred by the assassination last
week of Luis Carlos Galan, a leading presidential candidate who
promised to curb drug trafficking.
   The outpouring of public rage has made many Colombians hope the
battle against the cocaine barons can be won this time.
   Clara Obregon Lopez, a former Bogota city council member, said:
``The indignation is so strong that it's not leaving room for
fear,'' she said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the declaration of war on the Colombian government ``certainly
heightens the concern about security, both for the Colombian
government and for ourselves.''
   Officials say about 100 U.S. officials are connected with the
embassy in Bogota and about two dozen Drug Enforcement
Administration agents are in the country. The State Department said
it had no immediate plans to evacuate U.S. personnel.
   Police said one person was killed in the bombing of a wing of
Liberal Party offices in Medellin, an industrial city that serves as
a base for a cartel believed to supply as much as 80 percent of the
cocaine distributed in the United States.
   Also bombed was the Conservative Party headquarters, police said.
   The attackers set fire to the vacation homes of two prominent
politicians, former Finance Minister Edgard Gutierrez of the Liberal
Party and Conservative Sen. Ignacio Velez Escobar.
   Officials said they found powerful bombs hidden in suitcases left
at the Medellin offices of two national radio networks, Caracol and
Radio Cadena Nacional. The explosives were found and defused.
   At the Caracol station, the bombers left behind a statement dated
signed by ``The Extraditables,'' a group known to carry out attacks
for the Medellin cartel.
   ``We declare total and absolute war on the government, on the
industrial and political oligarchy, on the journalists that have
attacked and ravaged us, on the judges that have sold out to the
government, on the extraditing magistrates, on the presidents of the
unions and all those who who persecuted and attacked us,'' it said.
   ``We won't respect the families of those who have not respected
our families,'' it added. ``We will burn and destroy the industries,
the properties and the mansions of the oligarchies.''
   The bombed Liberal Party offices belonged to a faction of the
party that sponsored Galan's presidential candidacy. The explosion
blew in the front and part of the roof of the one-story concrete and
brick building.
   The office's director, Gustavo Garcia, said the person killed was
a passer-by.
   All the attacks occurred between midnight and 4 a.m.
   ``It wasn't exactly a surprise. When these people make a threat,
they carry it out,'' a senior State Department official said in
Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Barco issued decrees Thursday that would oblige traffickers to
come out of hiding to reclaim an estimated $200 million in property
and goods confiscated in the crackdown.
   They require owners to personally make claims for restitution,
barring them from using the lawyers, agents and middlemen routinely
employed by the drug kingpins.
   The decrees also gave traffickers just 10 days from the seizure
to make such claims or the state becomes the owner of the seized
property, which would be distributed among needy Colombians and
government branches.
   Galan, a critic of Colombia's massive dependence on the drug
trade, was gunned down just before he was to give a campaign speech
on Friday. Police said drug traffickers had placed a $500,000 price
on his head.
   The known leaders of the Medellin cartel are Pablo Escobar, Jorge
Ochoa and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. None of three was among the
hundreds of people arrested since Galan's killing.
   In New York, Gacha was indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday
on heroin importation charges.
   The most prominent alleged drug figure arrested so far is Eduardo
Martinez Romero. Police and U.S. authorities said they were trying
to arrange speedy extradition of Martinez, an alleged money manager
for the Medellin cartel.
   Barco has established emergency procedures for extraditing
traffickers wanted in the United States.
   The Supreme Court nullified the extradition treaty with
Washington in June 1987, after years of intimidation of the
judiciary. At least 220 judges and other officials have been killed.

   Panamanian leaders Thursday praised
the hands-off decision by the Organization of American States, which
called on Panamanians to solve their own iternal problems.
   The OAS action was a blow to the United States, which since May
has campaigned for regional action to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces and the
country's most powerful figure.
   The United States in February 1988 indicted Noriega on
drug-related charges.
   Leaders of Panama's political opposition meanwhile issued a
statement saying they will continue their struggle for Noriega to
step down.
   ``His removal,'' the statement said, ``is a must for the solution
of the Panamanian conflict.''
   The government annulled May presidential elections, which
international observers say the opposition won 3-1. The current
administration's term is up on Sept. 1 and the opposition wants to
take office.
   ``The OAS decision shows respect for the right of a country's
self-determination. The OAS has left Panamanians alone to solve
their own problems,'' Acting President Manuel Solis Palma said
Thursday.
   Solis made his remarks as he and Noriega visited the a rural fair
at the Rio Hato Military Base, about 80 miles southwest of the
capital.
   Noriega _ dressed in a white shirt with pockets embroidered with
Panamanian Indian symbols _ shook hands with well-wishers and waved
to the crowds, but made no comment when questioned by reporters.
   Defense Forces spokesman Maj. Edgardo Lopez Grimaldo said the OAS
refusal to condemn Panama was ``a victory for Panama and a
humiliation for the United States.''
   The OAS exhortation for an internal solution to the country's
conflicts followed several visits to Panama by a special mission
that met with opposition and government leaders in an attempt to
seek a negotiated settlement.
   Noriega said Tuesday the political opposition committed a
``historical error'' when it turned down a government offer earlier
this month to govern jointly after Sept. 1.
   Washington indicated Thursday it was considering new sanctions
against Panama but officials did not say what they might be.
   Since February 1988, the United States has imposed economic and
other barriers on Panama, including payment on Panama Canal tolls.
   The measures have contributed to substantial economic decline in
Panama.

<HEAD>Two Major Japanese Piano Makers Stop Ivory Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Japanese piano makers said Thursday they will stop
using imported ivory in piano keys to help protect African elephants.
   The musical instrument makers said synthetic materials can
replace the ivory preferred by many pianists because it absorbs
perspiration from the fingers.
   ``The measure was taken in the interest of saving elephants,''
said Haruo Gomi, a spokesman for Yamaha Corp., Japan's largest
musical instrument maker.
   Shigeru Sugiyama, spokesman of the Kawai Musical Instruments
Mfg., said his company also decided to discontinue imports of ivory
to make piano keys.
   Both Yamaha and Kawai are based in Hamamatsu, central Japan.
   Gomi said Yamaha has used synthetic products to make keys of some
expensive models for 10 years.
   Yamaha produces 190,000 pianos a year, he said, and uses about
1,540 pounds of ivory to make 300-350 high-grade pianos, including
its top-of-the-line CF-3 grand that costs $44,600.
   Gomi said the company imported about 2 tons of ivory in 1987 _
enough to last three years.
   In June, the Japanese government drastically curtailed ivory
imports to help save African elephants from extinction. Among
measures, the government banned shipments of worked ivory and ivory
scraps less than 2.2 pounds and under 8 inches long.
   In 1988, Japan imported 106 tons of unprocessed ivory and 26 tons
of finished ivory, according to government figures. Of the total, 53
percent of the imported ivory was used for family seals that are
commonly used as a substitute for signatures on documents, 28
percent for jewelry, 12 percent for musical instruments and the
remaining 7 percent for art products, according to the private
conservation group Traffic Japan.
   The African elephant population has fallen from about 1.5 million
in 1978 to as few as 400,000 today, mostly because of poachers who
seek the valuable tusks.
   
   Several Western nations, including the United States, have banned
the import of ivory in recent months. The 102-nation Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species will consider a worldwide
ban on the ivory trade in October.

   A 37-year-old woman, who has claimed to
be NBC-TV talk show host David Letterman's wife and was ordered to
stay away from him, was arrested Thursday for trespassing at his New
Canaan home, police said.
   Margaret Ray of Paonia, Colo., was arrested at the New Canaan
railroad station after police received a report that she was walking
on the grounds of Letterman's home, New Canaan police Sgt. Frank
Basso said.
   Ray was charged with first-degree criminal trespass and was being
held at the New Canaan police station on $10,000 bond pending
arraignment in Norwalk Superior Court Friday, Basso said.
   Basso declined to comment on whether Letterman was at home at the
time of the alleged incident.
   Ray pleaded guilty May 30 to using Letterman's car without his
permission and to two counts of first-degree criminal trespass.
   A Superior Court judge then ordered Ray released from a state
mental hospital. Ray had been confined at Fairfield Hills Hospital
in Newtown since a judge found her incompetent to stand trial in
April.
   Ray was sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence and three
years' probation.
   As a condition of probation, Ray was ordered to stay away from
Letterman and continue to undergo psychiatric treatement.
   She had been charged with two counts of third-degree burglary,
two counts of sixth-degree larceny, two counts of first-degree
criminal trespass, possession of marijuana and possession of drug
paraphernalia in connection with break-ins at Letterman's home on
Feb 24 and Feb. 28.
   In June 1988, Ray was arrested when she tried to pass herself off
as Letterman's wife after she was stopped near the Lincoln Tunnel in
New York City driving Letterman's 1988 Porsche.

<HEAD>No Elections In Haiti Before Next Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JACMEL, Haiti (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the independent Electoral
Council says a shortage of money means no elections can be held in
Haiti before next year.
   Council President Louis Antoine Auguste said the government has
not allocated a budget to the nine-member board, which was appointed
in April by institutions such as the Roman Catholic Church, labor
unions and human rights groups.
   ``For budgetary reasons, elections before the end of December are
not feasible,'' Auguste told 150 people meeting Tuesday at the city
hall in Jacmel, a town on the southern coast of this Caribbean
nation of 6 million.
   The council has toured rural Haiti since July and expects to fix
an election schedule by next week.
   Council members are asking voters whether they think national and
local elections should be staggered or held simultaneously and
whether 1 million Haitians living abroad should be allowed to
participate.
   ``We are trying to set an example of democratic behavior,'' said
the council's general secretary, Jean-Gerard Pierre.
   ``The citizens of certain remote areas were surprised that we
felt obligated to take account of their point of view. Haitians are
not used to being consulted by authorities,'' he said.
   Jacmel residents preferred elections in two stages, first
national and then local, begining early next year. They strongly
favored the participation of Haitians living abroad.
   Former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy dissolved the first electoral
council in November 1987, hours after gunmen protected by soldiers
massacred at least 34 voters at polling stations and aborted what
would have been Haiti's first free general elections since
independence in 1804.
   Namphy accused the council of being manipulated by ``foreign
powers.'' The United States, France and Canada contributed most of
its budget.
   He was ousted in a September 1988 coup that brought Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril to power. Namphy had led a provisional government
after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France in 1986.

   President Virgilio Barco fired back in
the war on drug traffickers Thursday with a salvo of decrees, one
obliging them to emerge from hiding to regain an estimated $200
million in confiscated property.
   Using emergency powers under a 4-year-old state of siege, he
passed a decree requiring owners to personally make claims for
restitution, barring them from using the lawyers, agents and
middlemen routinely employed by drug barons.
   It also gave them just 10 days from the time of seizure to make
such claims. In the event they do not, the state becomes the owner
of the confiscated property, which would be distributed as follows:
   _Ranches, livestock and other rural property and goods go to the
National Agrarian Fund for distribution among landless peasants.
   _Urban property and goods go to the Family Welfare Institute to
help needy children and mothers.
   _Cash, automobiles and trucks go to the judicial fund to be used
in improving working conditions for judges.
   _Aircraft and sea vessels go to the Defense Ministry and to the
air force's commercial transport business.
   _Arms go to the Defense Ministry and security police.
   Another decree calls for an inventory of all private airstrips
nationwide, and the destruction of those whose legitimate use cannot
be proven.
   Yet another is designed to ensure anonymity for Supreme Court
magistrates who review these and other decrees issued in an
unprecedented anti-narcotics offensive.
   The crackdown was prompted by the assassinations of a popular
presidential candidate, a police colonel and a superior court
magistrate last week.
   The offensive has included raids and seizures at more than 700
estates, businesses and other properties owned by or linked to
Colombia's powerful cocaine cartels. Authorities estimate that $200
million in property, including mansions, airplanes, cars and other
goods, have been impounded.
   On Thursday, an infuriated Medellin cocaine cartel declared
``total and absolute war'' on the government, the political
establishment and industries in what was viewed as an obvious bid to
pressure the government into easing up.
   Drug gangs bombed two political party offices on Thursday and
burned the homes of two politicians in Medellin.

   Former Black Panther Huey Newton ended his
rebellious life with an act of defiance, telling the gunman who was
to kill him, ``Man, I ain't getting in your car,'' a witness said.
   Police investigators continued Thursday to piece together
Newton's final hours amid speculation that his history of alcohol
and drug abuse may have contributed to his death.
   The San Francisco Examiner reported that Newton was murdered
after an encounter in drug-torn west Oakland with three ex-convicts,
who were later arrested and linked to the killing. But Oakland
police Lt. Mike Sims denied the report.
   Although family members refused to discuss Newton's drug use, a
close friend said the former Black Panther had a history of
substance abuse and entered a hospital treatment program in 1984.
   Investigators still have not identified a suspect or motive in
Tuesday's pre-dawn shooting, but they have received several accounts
from people who saw Newton in the crime-ridden neighborhood several
hours before he was slain.
   ``We've talked to people who were with him so we have a general
idea of his activities before he was killed,'' Sims said.
   Police said Newton shared drinks with a friend and left a short
time before his body was discovered at 5:30 a.m., according to
reports in Thursday editions of The (Oakland) Tribune newspaper.
   Michelle Johnson, who lives across the street from where Newton
was shot on Seventh Street, said she was awakened by loud voices on
the street moments before she heard the gunfire that killed Newton,
the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
   Johnson said she heard a brief argument and a man order someone,
apparently Newton, into a car.
   ``And the last thing Huey said was, `Man, I ain't getting in your
car,''' she said. ``It was like he was telling them, `Do what you're
going to do right here.'''
   At least three shots rang out and when Johnson peered out her
window, she saw Newton slumped on the sidewalk.
   Sims confirmed that police have interviewed Johnson but would not
reveal the contents of the discussion.
   Newton, 47, died in the same predominantly black west Oakland
neighborhood where he grew up and began organizing the Panthers in
1966. The area is now known for open dealing of crack cocaine and
frequent violent clashes between gang members.
   The neighborhood's reputation has fueled speculation that Newton
may have been there because of a drug problem, but police remained
silent on a possible motive for the slaying. Family members have
declined to comment on Newton's alleged drug use.
   Fred Hiestand, a close friend for 18 years and one of Newton'
attorneys, said the militant leader suffered from alcohol and drug
abuse but believed Newton had been clean for six months.
   ``That doesn't mean he couldn't have fallen off the wagon,'' said
Hiestand, who last spoke with Newton on Friday.
   Newton struggled to control his substance abuse problems, said
Hiestand. In 1984, Newton entered a treatment program at Alta Bates
Hospital in Berkeley, and fought recently to overcome his problems
on his own, Hiestand said.
   Earlier this year, Newton served time in San Quentin Prison for a
parole violation for possessing cocaine and drug paraphernalia.
   Preliminary results of an autopsy have not been released, and
findings of drug and alcohol tests are not yet available, Sims said.
   Police are also investigating a published account of Newton's
last hours by a woman who called herself Pat Wright, which is not
her true name, said Sims, who refused to reveal her identity.
   The woman, who lives two blocks from the shooting scene and
described herself as Newton's former girlfriend, said Newton visited
her late Monday night and stayed until 1 a.m. on the morning he died.
   ``He said he was fighting a battle, and he kept saying that two
or three times,'' she said. ``I told him I understood, but I could
tell something was wrong. He knew something was about to happen.''
   Since the shooting, the sidewalk where Newton lay mortally
wounded has become something of a shrine, with flowers, candles and
a steady stream of mourners embellishing the site.

<HEAD>Eds: ADDS that Camden plant is original plant, UPDATES with details

<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co., which began making soup
here 120 years ago, will close its original plant, three U.S.
factories and five overseas for a loss of nearly 2,800 jobs, the
company said Thursday.
   Campbell said it would keep its headquarters in this poor
southern New Jersey city on the Delaware River, but would move
production at the 940-employee plant to canneries in Napoleon, Ohio;
Paris, Texas; and Maxton, N.C. The headquarters employs about 1,700
people.
   The company said that as part of a worldwide restructuring it
also plans to close a 272-employee plant in Pocomoke City, Md.; a
plant employing 246 people in Crisfield, Md., and an 84-employee
plant in Smyrna, Tenn.
   The five overseas plants, which employ 1,200 people, were not
identified. Campbell said it would close the Camden plant by next
July, but did not have a timetable for any of the other closings.
   Many employees will be offered transfers, while others will be
offered severance pay or help finding other jobs, the company said.
   The restructuring was approved at a board of directors meeting
earlier Thursday, said spokeswoman Marsha Cade.
   ``We feel that this will make Campbell more efficient,'' said Ms.
Cade. She said the U.S. plants being closed were older, and ``just
aren't as efficient as they should be.''
   ``It would cost over a billion dollars to bring the Camden plant
alone up to date,'' she said.
   Plants in Chicago, Memphis, Mich.; Doylestown and Pottstown, Pa.;
already have closed, and Campbell has sold its fresh-produce
subsidiary and ingredient plants in Center and Nacogdoches, Texas;
Clayton, Del., and Cairo, Ga.
   The company has about 100 plants around the world, 60 of them in
the United States.
   Campbell sells about 5 billion cans of soup a year, garnering
about 65 percent of the $2.2 billion retail soup market, a drop of
about 5 percent in the past five years.
   Although Campbell is closing the plant where it got its start in
1869, it plans to start building a new $35 million,
200,000-square-foot headquarters on the waterfront across the
Delaware from Philadelphia.
   ``Campbell is very committed to Camden,'' Ms. Cade said.
   Melvin ``Randy'' Primas, mayor of this city of 85,000 people,
said the announcement was not a surprise. ``We have been trying to
prepare for this day,'' Primas said.
   The closing will have no major effect on a $500 million
waterfront redevelopment project, said Thomas P. Corcoran, executive
director of the Cooper Ferry Development Association.
   ``Obviously it's not good news for the city of Camden to lose a
large number of manufacturing jobs,'' said Corcoran. ``Plants like
that are dinosaurs.''
   Ms. Cade the restructuring resulted from a three-year study of
Campbell's plants and operations.
   Marvin B. Roffman, an analyst with the brokerage firm Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, said the announcement
constituted a statement by Campbell management that ``we're going to
be lean and mean.''
   ``Any food company who wants to be independent in the '90s had
better be a very low-cost producer with a global presence,'' Roffman
said.
   Some analysts have said Campbell had too many inefficient plants.
For years, John T. Dorrance Jr., the son of the inventor of
condensed soup, hesitated to lay off workers or shut down plants.
   Before his death in April, Dorrance began to see the writing on
the wall: that the food industry was moving to consolidated,
state-of-the-art operations, Roffman said.

   An ugly brown barge carrying 120 tons
of obsolete rocket-launching structures exploded Wednesday in flames
and smoke in the Atlantic Ocean, then sank to become an artificial
reef.
   ``She lived by fire and she died by fire,'' salvage specialist
Ryan Moore said after three pieces of space material and the old oil
barge welded into a single structure were sunk 18 miles east of the
Cape Canaveral space complex.
   Army ordnance experts used 40 pounds of plastic explosives to
blow out the barge's bottom, sending it to the ocean floor 120 feet
below.
   The reef, which will provide an environment for grouper, snapper
and other sea life, was the culmination of a nearly two-year effort
by federal agencies, industry, environmental groups, the military
and individuals.
   It consists of:
   _ A rust-red, 60-ton umbilical tower off Launch Pad 36A, which
helped launch more than 75 space flights, including the
Atlas-Centaur series that boosted the Surveyor probe to the moon.
   _ A 40-ton missile access stand from Launch Pad 29, which
supported test launches of Polaris and Poseidon missiles.
   _ A 10-ton shuttle-Centaur support stand from Launch Pad 36A.
   _ The 10-ton, 180-foot-long oil barge built in the 1940s.
   ``Its great to see some of the materials once used to launch
America into space put to good use,'' said Dave Murphree of the
Florida Sport Fishing Association, which helped coordinate the
project.
   Much of the estimated $40,000 cost was paid for by the
FishAmerica Foundation, a private fishery conservation group, and
Humminbird Depth Sounders of Eufaula, Ala., which makes sonar and
electronic fish finders.
   The barge was towed out by a barge. In calm seas, four ordnance
experts set the explosives. Around 1:30 p.m., they set a 10-minute
timer, climbed aboard a waiting speedboat and sped away from the
barge before the charge went off.
   Orange and yellow flames enveloped the barge and its cargo _
about 35 feet high _ before a small, gray-and-white mushroom cloud
spiraled up into bright, nearly cloudless skies.
   As a boatload of reporters and photographers watched from a half
mile away, the structure quickly sank. It was gone within two
minutes.
   ``We intend to support many more of these artificial reefs with
old space material,'' said Humminbird spokesman Rodney Huey. ``Maybe
our next one will have stuff that's already been in space.''

<TEXT>
   The brother-in-law of former Mexican President
Luis Echeverria appeared Thursday before a federal grand jury
investigating the 1985 murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena.
   Ruben Zuno-Arce, 59, a prominent Mexican businessman suspected of
involvement in drug trafficking, was brought to the panel's hearing
room after being granted immunity from prosecution for anything he
may disclose while testifying secretly.
   Zuno-Arce was arrested Aug. 9 in San Antonio by U.S. immigration
agents as he tried to cross into Mexico. An inspector recognized
Zuno-Arce as one of those on a list of suspected drug traffickers,
authorities said.
   His three lawyers were not permitted to be present at the secret
proceeding but were allowed to wait in a corridor. The witness had
the right to leave the hearing room and consult with them at any
time.
   Because of the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, it was not
known whether Zuno-Arce cooperated in testifying. He was granted
``use immunity'' after he said he would invoke Fifth Amendment
protection against self-incrimination and refuse to testify.
   Use immunity means that he cannot be prosecuted on the basis of
anything he says in the closed hearing.
   In an unusual procedure, Zuno-Arce has been held without bail
since he was arrested in San Antonio, Tex. on Aug. 9. His attorneys
argued that he should be freed because he is not charged with any
crime. But in a hearing last Friday, U.S. District Judge Edward
Rafeedie ruled that Zuno-Arce is a flight risk and that he may have
significant information about the Camarena case.
   He urged prosecutors to quickly obtain a grant of immunity for
Zuno-Arce, have him appear before a grand jury and then release him
from custody.
   It was unclear how soon after his appearance Thursday the witness
could be released. The 1985 kidnapping and torture murder of
Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala-Avelar, became an
international incident. The Drug Enforcement Administration has
vowed to bring in every person involved in the murders.
   Several members of the Mexican federal police force were linked
to the killings and one, Raul Lopez Alvarez, was convicted last year
along with two drug traffickers.
   The government wants Zuno-Arce to testify in the trial of a
recently charged defendant, Juan Jose Bernabe-Ramirez, a former
member of the Jalisco State Judicial Police.
   They have linked Zuno-Arce to the sale of a home in Guadalajara
which was subsequently bought by Mexican drug lord Rafael
Caro-Quintero. Authorities believe Camarena was murdered at that
house.
   Caro-Quintero, who is accused of orchestrating the murders, is in
custody awaiting trial in Mexico City. Seven more men are charged
with murder and conspiracy in the case.

   Sen. Eduardo Menem, provisional leader of the

London next month to attend an international lawmakers conference,
the Foreign Office said Thursday.
   The visit is the latest step in improving relations between
Britain and Argentina, which severed diplomatic relations during the

   The Foreign Office said in a statement that Sen. Menem will head
a delegation of Argentine parliamentarians to the
Inter-Parliamentary Union conference, which starts Sept. 4.
   The Inter-Parliamentary Union is a worldwide organization of
lawmakers who meet periodically to study international problems.
About 2,000 delegates from around the world are scheduled to take
part in the conference.
   Sen. Menem is expected to attend the opening ceremony and a
British government reception, the British domestic news agency Press
Association reported.
   Representatives of the two governments agreed during talks last
week in New York to meet in Madrid, Spain on Oct. 17-18 to discuss
normalizing relations.
   President Menem, who took office on July 8, dropped the previous
government's insistence that Argentina's sovereignty claim must be
the first issue considered, opening the way for normalization talks.
   Argentina invaded and occupied the Falklands, 325 miles off its
southeast coast, in April 1982 but Britain sent a task force and
recaptured the islands in a 74-day war that claimed nearly 1,000
lives.
   Argentina claims the Falklands, which it calls the Malvinas, as
an inheritance from days of Spanish colonial rule and says the
British, who have ruled them as a colony since 1833, stole the
islands.

   President Daniel Ortega announced
Thursday the release of 179 peasants imprisoned after accusations of
aiding the rebels.
   In a speech before 10,000 peasants in this town, 180 miles
southeast of the capital city of Managua, Ortega said, ``They
shouldn't feel defeated, because the defeat was for Yankee
imperialism.''
   The Sandinista government recently made an agreement with a
Nicaraguan agricultural organization to free 1,200 peasants jailed
for alleged complicity with the rebels, known as Contras.
   The U.S.-backed rebels are to disband under an agreement Ortega
and four other Central American presidents signed this month in
Honduras. In return, Nicaragua has promised free and fair elections.
   About 11,000 rebels and 12,000 dependents are in camps in
Honduras as a temporary cease-fire remains in effect. The government
estimates that 2,500 more are in Nicaragua.
   Nicaragua has offered an amnesty for all Contras who lay down
their weapons and return home.
   Ortega said, ``We must change from the gun to the plow'' to
achieve national unity.
   As for Contras who refuse to abide by the peace plan, Ortega
said, ``We will look for them like a cat looks for a rat.''
   The president said that in recent days, the government has freed
239 peasants from prison.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Kim Dae-jung Indicted in Spy Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday indicted Kim
Dae-jung, leader of South Korea's largest opposition party, and two
lawmakers on charges of failing to report a legislator's secret trip
to communist North Korea.
   Prosecutors issued a statement saying the three were accused of
failing to report the visit of National Assemblyman Suh Kyung-won to
the North in August 1988. The statement said they would not be
detained.
   If convicted, Kim, head of the Party for Peace and Democracy; Kim
Won-ki the party's parliamentary floor leader, and Rep. Lee
Chul-yong could be sentenced to a maximum five years each in prison.
   Kim Dae-jung, who ran for president in 1971 and 1987, has
strongly denied allegations he had anything to do with Suh's trip or
espionage and accused the government of trying to undermine his
party.
   The prosecutor's office said the indictments were being sent by
registered mail and the first court hearing probably will be held
within a month.
   Suh was arrested on June 28 and charged with espionage, with
violating a ban on unauthorized travel to North Korea and with
receiving $120,000 from North Korean agents before and during his
secret trip to Pyongyang.
   Prosecutors said Kim Dae-jung would be charged with violating the
law governing foreign exchange for allegedly receiving $10,000 from
Suh, who they said got the money from North Korean agents.
   The prosecution said Kim Dae-jung apparently did not know the
money came from North Korea so the charge was limited to a minor
violation, which says anyone receiving foreign currency must report
it within 10 days
   In an interview on Thursday, Kim Dae-jung accused investigators
of using torture tactics on Suh and two of the nine others jailed
since the case became public at the end of June.
   Anticipating the indictment against him, Kim Dae-jung said it
``would be a turning point in South Korean politics. It's an
indication the Roh regime has given up promises for
democratization.''
   Roh has introduced widespread democratic reforms since he took
office last year but critics complain he has not done enough to
introduce full democracy.
   The president's foes also charge that Roh is reneging on his
campaign promise to clear up misdeeds and corruption committed under
his disgraced predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan.
   Prosecutors say they have evidence Kim Dae-jung knew about Suh's
trip two months before the case was made public in June. He denied
it, saying he learned of the trip shortly before Suh turned himself
in to authorities in late June.
   Suh, a 52-year-old farmer elected to the National Assembly in
April 1988, was expelled from the party after his trip was made
public.
   The Seoul government prohibits unauthorized travel to North
Korea, an enemy country since the Korean peninsula was divided in
1945. The two Koreas fought a bloody war in 1950-53 and never signed
a peace treaty.
   Kim Dae-jung, 64, spent almost seven years in prison after a 1976
conviction on anti-government activity and a 1980 conviction on
sedition charges. Opposition supporters say these convictions were
based on trumped-up charges by repressive governments.

<TEXT>
   The National Action Party on Thursday demanded
an investigation of the administrators of the giant Cananea
copper-mining company, whose declaration of insolvency four days ago
threw 3,200 miners out of work.
   ``It's urgent and necessary to examine who is responsible for the
bankruptcy,'' Eugenio Ortiz, economic affairs coordinator for the
conservative opposition party, told a news conference.
   The government owns 90 percent of the open-pit mine, the largest
in Mexico and 10th largest in the world. It sent 3,000 soldiers to
close the mine site, 25 miles south of the Arizona border, when
bankruptcy was declared last Sunday.
   The action came one week before a strike scheduled by Cananea
miners to press their demands for a 330 percent wage-and-benefit
increase. Mine workers earn from $3,000 to $4,000 per year.
   The government plans to sell its share of the company to private
interests as part of a national strategy to trim federal investment
in Mexican business.
   The National Action Party draws its strongest support from
northern Mexico and advocates privatization of government-owned
industries. But, Ortiz said, ``We don't agree with the way they're
doing it.''
   His party says the government should let the public know what
private investors are being considered in sales of government stock.
In the case of prospective Cananea buyers, ``they haven't let the
public know,'' Ortiz said.
   National Action blamed both the government and the union for the
bankruptcy.
   ``The Mexican government is the principal responsible for the bad
administration that sunk Cananea in the inefficiency'' that led to
bankruptcy, it said in a news release.
   ``Union bossism is also responsible for the blunders that entered
into the unsustainable situation that has provoked the bankruptcy of
the Cananea mining company.''
   Since last year, two deals to sell off the government's share of
the indebted company have fallen through.
   Miners fought privatization and called the bankruptcy declaration
a union-busting tactic. They blocked highways leading out of Cananea
for more than an hour on Wednesday in a protest march.
   National Action on Thursday backed miners' demands for higher
severance pay.
   Other opposition parties joined National Action in congressional
sessions Wednesday in demanding an investigation of Cananea's
administration. But the Institutional Revolutionary Party majority
overruled the proposition.
   In elections last month, National Action's candidate won the
first opposition party governorship in history in northern Baja
California.

   Voyager 2 began its final approach to
Neptune today, showing the planet's strange moon Triton to be a
bright pink, red and blue marble ringed by what could be a
snow-covered glacier of frozen natural gas, scientists say.
   At 9 a.m. PDT today Voyager was expected to be 472,056 miles from
Neptune, caught in the grip of Neptune's powerful gravity and
falling toward the fourth largest planet at a speed of 38,599 mph.
   At 8:56 p.m. PDT Voyager will pass 3,042 miles from Neptune's
cloud tops, closer than it has come to any other celestial object on
its 4.4 billion-mile journey from Earth.
   Researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory planned an
all-night vigil as the most detailed images begin coming back from
the spacecraft early Friday morning. It takes 4 hours and six
minutes for radio signals from the spacecraft to reach Earth.

   A team of scientists from the United States and
Canada believe they have discovered the fatal gene defect that
causes cystic fibrosis.
   The team of molecular biologists scheduled news conferences today
in Toronto and Washington to report on the discovery, details of
which are to be published in the scientific journal Science next
month.
   ``This is one of the most significant discoveries in the history
of human genetics,'' Dr. Ronald Worton, chief geneticist at
Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children's said Wednesday.
   The discovery is a crucial step toward developing either a new
treatment or a cure for the inherited disease _ the most common
genetic defect in whites. About half of those who suffer from the
disease don't live to adulthood.

   A move by five grocery chains against a
synthetic hormone designed to boost cows' milk production may help
delay government approval for its commercial use, says an
anti-genetic engineering activist.
   Five food chains say they are not selling milk from cows treated
experimentally with the synthetic hormone, Jeremy Rifkin, head of
the Foundation on Economic Trends, said Wednesday.
   Bovine growth hormone, or BGH, is designed to boost cows'
production by as much as one-third.
   The decision by the food companies, as well as rising concerns in
dairy states, will ``put a lot of pressure'' on the Food and Drug
Administration to put off final approval of the hormone for general
use, Rifkin said.

   The number of elderly people living alone will
surge in the next century, creating more demand for support services
such as home care to help them avoid nursing homes, researchers say.
   ``The number of frail elderly, elderly with health limitations
and elderly living alone will all exceed the general increase in the
elderly population,'' said a report by the Urban Institute, a
private agency.
   The elderly of the next century will have fewer children and will
divorce or remain single more often, leaving many without a
``significant caregiver'' and heightening their need for public and
private services, the researchers reported.
   In a study titled ``The Needs of the Elderly in the 21st
Century,'' the researchers called for efforts to help prevent people
from becoming disabled as they age, target services toward those who
most need help, and rework financing so needed services are more
affordable for the elderly.

   A bank for children thinks a credit card is
just what its kiddie customers want, but one opponent says teaching
a new generation how to borrow is the last thing this debt-plagued
country needs.
   ``We think it teaches absolutely the wrong message,'' said Loren
Dunton, president of the National Center for Financial Education, a
non-profit group that seeks to promote financial responsibility.
   ``Our message is to save now so you can buy later, and they're
promoting the philosophy of buy now and pay later.''
   The San Diego-based center plans to use its branches in 50 states
to ask parents and teachers to oppose a plan by the Young Americans
Bank to provide credit cards to children ages 12 and older.
   But the Denver-based bank, whose customers are all young people,
said it is trying to teach the proper use of credit as part of
personal finance.
   ``Our feeling is that credit cards are really a way of life, and
a lot of us learn about credit in an undesireable way ... without
any supervision or control,'' bank president Linda Sanders said.
``Here that is done with control.''

<HEAD>Alan Spencer Collaborating with Hero, Mel Brooks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Alan Spencer was taking a college TV
writing class, he encountered the same frustrations many students do.
   ``My script flunked. It got, like, a D. It was, like, a `One Day
at a Time,' and they said this could never sell.
   ``And I said, `It's on next week!'''
   Spencer by then was a veteran script writer. He was selling TV
scripts when he was 17, the only kid in high school earning
residuals.
   Now, at the ripe old age of 29 _ he quickly adds that he'll be 30
in October _ Spencer is launching his second prime-time network
comedy, ``Nutt House,'' premiering next month on NBC. It stars
Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman as the, respectively, officious
and bizarre staff of a large, unlikely New York hotel.
   Spencer's first show, an homage to his hero, Mel Brooks, and
Brooks' 1960s satirical spy comedy ``Get Smart,'' was ABC's ``Sledge
Hammer!'' Like ``Get Smart,'' it was heavy on inside jokes and
physical gags.
   This time around, Spencer is not gazing from afar, but is paired
with his idol. Producer-director Brooks co-wrote the pilot with
Spencer and is co-executive producer of ``Nutt House'' with Spencer
and Bob Brunner.
   Spencer proclaimed in his high school yearbook that his goal in
life was to work with Mel Brooks.
   ``I don't know, I just liked Mel Brooks' humor, because it's
shocking, it's different, it's outrageous, it usually makes
statements about life. But I think the key thing is, his goal is
really to make you laugh,'' Spencer told an often
laughter-interrupted session with television critics to discuss the
new show.
   ``Nutt House'' will join NBC's Wednesday lineup, well matched
with its lead-in, the broadly comic ``Night Court.'' The pilot that
was screened for the critics was wildly slapstick, and Spencer said
portions would be re-shot and toned down to develop the characters
and emotional story a little more.
   But Spencer hopes the show will mark a return to physical and
visual comedy on television that Brooks has produced to such effect
in films such as ``Young Frankenstein'' and ``High Anxiety.''
Spencer acknowledges it will be hard ``to do a high-standard kind of
feature-level comedy'' week after week.
   He added: ``I watch a lot of Marx Brothers movies and things to
get the inspiration.''
   Brooks will not be involved in the day-to-day production of the
show, but will serve as ``shepherd,'' Spencer said. The show will,
however, reflect Brooks' comedy philosophy, ``be savage against
those in authority, and be kind to those underneath it, that suffer
from it,'' Spencer said.
   The shooting of the ``Nutt House'' pilot gave Spencer the
opportunity to go to the studio with Brooks, instead of sneaking
onto a studio lot to see him as he used to do, explaining to studio
guards that he was Brooks' son.
   ``I went up to him on the set of `Young Frankenstein.' He was
directing, and I said, `Are you busy?' I said I wanted some advice
on how to get into comedy writing. That's the first time I met him.
I remember all these things, you know. `Go away,' you know.''
   Spencer did manage to work for Brooks eventually, writing
punch-up jokes for Brooks' last TV comedy, the short-lived Robin
Hood satire ``When Things Were Rotten.''
   Spencer said Brooks was a fan of ``Sledge Hammer!'' which went
off the air two seasons ago after a two-season run. So when Disney
offered a hotel set from the feature film ``Big Business'' for use
as a television show set, Brooks called Spencer.
   Now they're pals.
   ``You honestly wish you could have a film camera, just film a day
with him, because there's so many things that get lost,'' Spencer
said. ``We were driving along once, because we'd always go to these
lunches at this deli, ... and there was this man hitchhiking, and it
looked like he'd killed his whole family. ... He had like chains on
and a torn T-shirt and drooling and everything, and he had his thumb
out. And Mel looked at him and went, `The height of optimism!'''

   WHO'S FLIPPING WHEN? _ Not all that many viewers are flipping
channels via remote control during prime-time television programs,
according to results of a survey conducted by The Roper Organization
and released by ABC. Most of those who do roam during a broadcast
are young males. A survey of 1,000 adults about their viewing habits
for 48 hours during a period in January and February showed that 7
percent changed channels during commercials, and 3 percent during
the program. Sixty-five percent said they knew what they were going
to watch when the turned on the set, and 10 percent said they turned
on the set and then flipped channels to find something to watch.
Most of those surveyed said they flipped channels out of boredom or
to see what else was on.

   Only one Alabama city still clings to a city
commission form of government elected at-large, a system once
commonplace but now mostly dismantled in what one scholar calls the
South's ``Second Reconstruction.''
   But change may come to the holdout, Muscle Shoals. A federal
judge is considering whether to order the creation of seven voting
districts that could bring the first black into office in the city,
which is about 10 percent black.
   Similar rulings swept the state because of litigation prompted by
the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The major victim of the lawsuits was the
at-large commission form of government, viewed as a bastion of white
political power because blacks seeking representation from their
areas were outvoted by the white majority.
   There still are some at-large-elected councils, but only one such
city commission. County commissions and school boards did not escape
restructuring, either. Of the 67 county commissions, only a handful
are elected at-large, most in northern Alabama where there are fewer
blacks. The pattern applies to the 67 county school boards and the
three city systems _ Huntsville, Jacksonville and Scottsboro _ that
elect their boards. The other 62 boards are appointed.
   ``It amounts to a Second Reconstruction,'' said Chandler
Davidson, a political sociologist at Rice University, referring to
the Reconstruction Era after the Civil War. Davidson testified in
many federal hearings on lawsuits challenging the at-large method of
electing city officials in many cities.
   Davidson and other political scientists will meet Thursday in
Atlanta to discuss the full impact of the Voting Rights Act on the
South.
   One of the most far-reaching lawsuits stemming from the act was
filed in the late 1970s against Mobile, which Davidson ranked among
the most segregated cities in the country in terms of jobs,
education, housing and politics.
   Bolden vs. City of Mobile paved the way for a 1982 amendment to
the Voting Rights Act eliminating the need to prove intentional
discrimination in efforts to change at-large election systems that
perpetuated white dominance. No longer could all-white governments
defend at-large election systems by saying simply that the intent of
the system had nothing to do with racial discrimination.
   Mobile changed from a city commission, elected citywide, to a
mayor and a council chosen from seven districts. Three blacks were
elected.
   The 1982 amendment ended cities' resistance to racial change. And
it didn't go unnoticed that Mobile's legal bill was over $1 million.
Soon, the financial burden and the increasing likelihood of
courtroom defeat moved scores of local governments to change.
   The commission form of government is ``history,'' said Tuscaloosa
City Attorney Bob Ennis. ``You can no longer have a form of
government that is not constantly aware of how cities operate on a
daily basis.'' Tuscaloosa settled a voting rights lawsuit quickly
six years ago, switching to a mayor and council.
   ``We're constantly aware of the Voting Rights Act every time
there's an annexation, redistricting or substantive change,'' Ennis
said.
   There are 440 cities in the state, with an average of five
council districts each. Some 410 council members are now blacks, and
there are 31 black mayors, said the Alabama Democratic Conference, a
black political caucus. There were 12 black mayors and 94 black
council members in 1979.
   However, changes in city hall don't necessarily reflect changed
cities.
   ``If you travel across the Black Belt now, what you will find,
more often than not, is a courthouse controlled by blacks surrounded
by white merchants who control everything else and they are hardly
speaking, said Selma lawyer J.L. Chestnut, a veteran of
change-of-government lawsuits.
   ``So we have to take into consideration questions beyond the mere
political consequences of an election arrangement,'' Chestnut said.
   U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson is considering a lawsuit that
could lead to change for a handful of cities that still have
at-large elections, including Muscle Shoals, which has never had a
black on its three-member city commission. The lawsuit began with
some 150 cities as defendants, but more than half have made changes
that satisfied the courts and black voters who filed it.
   Some ``Black Belt'' cities in western Alabama were forced to
change through state legislation. Each has unique circumstances, and
most officials report political acceptance of choosing council
members from districts.
   Brundidge, a mostly black city of 3,300, last year gave up its
commission in favor of a mayor-council system. ``You have more input
under this system, a good racial and income mix,'' said Mayor James
T. Ramage III, who is white.
   Gadsden Mayor David Nolen believes that residents of his city of
47,000, which is 25 percent black, would return to a citywide system
if given a choice. The mayor-council system adopted in 1986 because
of a lawsuit has been typified by ``bickering'' between the mayor
and council members, he said. There are two blacks on the
seven-member council.
   Some smaller cities remain unaffected, mainly because of their
low percentage of blacks. In Arab, an all-white city of 6,600, City
Attorney Dave Beuoy said the mayor and five council members are
still elected at-large.
   Such cities with few blacks, like Muscle Shoals, pose a delicate
problem.
   ``Small municipalities are viewed by many whites as their last
sanctuary, and if we're going to have viable working relationships
across racial lines, we have to be careful how we go about these
things,'' Chestnut said.
   Birmingham voted out the city commission in 1962, though the
current nine-member city council, now majority black, remains
elected citywide. However, a federal judge is weighing a proposal to
switch to election from districts _ six black and three white _
after a group of whites filed a reverse-discrimination lawsuit
claiming the white vote was diluted by citywide elections.
   Birmingham is waiting for a ruling from U.S. District Judge
Robert Propst before proceeding with October elections, said City
Attorney Jim Baker. ``This is the only case filed by whites I know
of.''

<HEAD>Washington: Take A Tip From The States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 20 years of watching Congress fail to
balance the federal budget, you might be forgiven for believing it
cannot be done. But budgets can be balanced, and the evidence is
hard to ignore.
   That evidence: In the very period in which the federal government
has failed, the states as a whole repeatedly have finished the
fiscal year with a cumulative net surplus.
   They have done it with relatively simple tools. Forty-nine of the
states have balanced-budget requirements; 43 states give the
governor line-item veto power, and 26 states have tax and
expenditure limitations.
   Federal lawmakers have passed over this evidence, says Steven
Moore, who earns his professional credits analyzing such matters. If
they paid attention, he says, they would learn two additional things:
   1. The federal budget deficit crisis is unlikely to be resolved
by further increases in taxes. At the state level, higher tax
revenues have generally encouraged even greater spending.
   2. Raising taxes could sound the death knell to America's
seven-year economic expansion. There's plenty of state-level
evidence that raising taxes undermines the economy.
   Moore, who studies federal budgetary matters for the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank, claims states that restrain
taxes generally achieve more rapid growth in income, jobs and
business investment than their higher-taxed neighbors.
   To illustrate: The economies of Arizona, California and, until
recently, Massachusetts, surged during the 1980s after they cut
taxes sharply. Conversely, three of the slowest growing states _
Iowa, West Virginia and Wyoming _ substantially raised taxes in the
same period.
   Additional evidence:
   The national economic expansion since 1983 has yielded revenue
windfalls for the treasuries of most state governments. The states
benefiting most from the burgeoning national economy have been those
in the Northeast.
   In this region, personal income grew about four times faster than
in the nation as a whole between 1978 and 1987, and unemployment at
the end of 1988 was about 2.5 percent. These states should be among
the most fiscally sound.
   Sad, but not true, says Moore. The Northeast states are facing a
severe fiscal crisis and several might be in the red in the next
year. Their good fortune sent them off on a spending spree.
   Such a process is insidious, suggests Moore. Higher revenues
trigger new spending. The new spending items become politically
indispensable fixtures and cannot be cut. As budget balances
deteriorate, pressures mount for higher taxes. Taxes are raised and
the slowing economy becomes slower.
   Based on his and other studies, Moore contends incomes grow
fastest in low-tax states, employment grows fastest in low-tax
states and rising state taxes deter business investment. The latter,
he says, managed to end the so-called Massachusetts Miracle; as
taxes rose, per capita income plunged.
   Federal lawmakers have ignored the evidence, passing no less than
13 tax increases since 1982 that have brought federal, state and
local tax receipts to one-third of gross national product. A crisis
nears, says Moore.
   Washington, he concludes, should take a tip from the states, not
only about the damage that is self-inflicted by raising taxes, but
about the means to bringing expenditures into line with revenues.
There's no mystery, he says.

   When some actors tire of filmmaking, they take a
break. Not Michael Caine _ he turns to television movies instead.
   ``This'll save people saying, `Oh, he made another movie,''' the
56-year-old actor said as he joked about his prolific celluloid
output.
   He was talking on a break in filming ``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,''
the latest film version of Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 horror
classic. Others have starred John Barrymore (1921), Frederic March
(1931) and Spencer Tracy (1941).
   It is Caine's second Victorian-era TV melodrama in two years.
``Jack the Ripper'' was aired last October.
   The two-hour, $6.3 million ``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,''
co-starring Cheryl Ladd and written and directed by David Wickes, is
to be shown early next year on ABC in the United States, and around
Christmas in Britain on the Independent Television Network.
   ``The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' as the novel was
titled, tells of kindly Dr. Jekyll who experiments with chemical
changes in his body, believing he can distill the good in himself
from the evil. The evil persona, whom he names Mr. Hyde, gradually
takes over and commits murder. The book ends with Jekyll's suicide.
   Caine sees the story as ``one man fighting a battle against
himself.''
   ``He's always fighting the evil within him,'' he said in an
interview. ``When he's Jekyll, he's never evil, and when he's evil
he's a monster; he turns into this thing. Once I've got (Hyde's)
mask on, I'm not Mr. Sympathy, believe me.''
   The producers won't reveal what Hyde looks like but promise he'll
be terrifying. They use modern makeup techniques _ devices and
effects unknown to Barrymore when he played the role in a silent
movie 68 years ago.
   Ladd plays Sara Crawford, sister of Jekyll's dead wife, who falls
for Jekyll and discovers too late the Hyde that lurks beneath.
Crawford is Wickes' invention, one of several departures from the
original story, which the director said needed shaking up.
   ``The book is told second-hand by this lawyer as a retelling of
what happened some years back,'' said Wickes. ``Also, there's no
female interest at all. I invented Cheryl's character as my ideal
girl, that is to say tough and feminine all at once.''
   Ladd, best known as one of TV's ``Charlie's Angels,'' said she
was drawn to the project by the prospect of working with her Academy
Award-winning co-star.
   ``Michael is just sensational,'' she said, keeping an eye on her
14-year-old daughter, Jordan, who appears in the restaurant scene as
an extra. ``He makes me laugh all the time; he's very funny.''
   Caine said the movie gives him a part he could never get to do on
the big screen: ``I thought, `When else am I going to get a chance
to play Jekyll and Hyde? They're not going to do it in movies
again.'''
   The story has been filmed often. March won an Oscar for his
version a decade after Barrymore's. It was remade 10 years later
with Tracy and Ingrid Bergman, a movie now shown on television with
washed-out tints in a colorized version.
   Caine said he likes the priorities of TV filming: ``The great
thing is they concentrate on the actor. It's your performance
they're shooting, and you don't have to wait for the cavalry to come
over the hill for an hour before they shoot your close-up.
   ``I like that because I'm lazy, and I only work well under
pressure.''
   However, he's not forsaking the large screen. He has just
finished ``Shock to the System,'' which he describes as a ``comic
nightmare.'' Swoozie Kurtz and Elizabeth McGovern co-star under Jan
Egleson's direction. Next he's in ``Bull's-eye'' opposite fellow
Briton Roger Moore of James Bond fame.
   Born Maurice Micklewhite, Caine shot to fame in 1966 as the
Cockney philanderer in ``Alfie.'' A master of character acting, he
has won acclaim as the drunken professor in ``Educating Rita,'' as
the unfaithful husband in ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' which won him
an Academy Award, and most recently as a con artist in ``Dirty
Rotten Scoundrels.''
   He recently signed to write his autobiography for Random House,
and thinks director Wickes may already have provided a title.
   ``Instead of saying `cut, print,' he always says, `Been there,
done that,''' said Caine. ``That might be a good title.''

   In coming months, Congress must decide whether
the B-2 ``stealth bomber,'' the most expensive plane ever designed
and built, is a weapon the United States can't afford to do without,
or simply can't afford. Yet for all the secrecy surrounding this
high-tech marvel, the ideas behind it are, by aviation standards,
almost ancient history.

   It rests, in pieces, in a grimy corner of a
museum warehouse in suburban Silver Hill, Md., long forgotten by the
nation that conceived its menacing promise as the least detectable
bomber in the skies.
   Re-assembled, it would look like a huge vampire bat or a
stub-tailed manta ray. Underlying its design was the notion that the
enemy wouldn't see it at all, because this jet-powered flying wing's
skin would be made of composite materials to absorb radar waves,
rather than reflect them.
   No, the Northrop B-2 bomber, the world's most expensive airplane,
hasn't already become a dust-gathering relic _ although some
critics, convinced the albatross is the only sea-creature to which
it should be compared, wish that were so.
   The astonishing lookalike in Silver Hill is indeed a stealth
warplane, but it was secretly built and test-flown 45 years ago by
Nazi Germany.
   For all the fanfare surrounding the use of the word ``stealth''
since it was introduced to the U.S. military vocabulary in 1980, the
B-2 and such radar-evading relatives as the F-117A fighter represent
concepts which, by aviation standards, are almost ancient.
   The B-2 has been financed, until this year, out of the Pentagon's
mysterious ``black'' budget. For eight years, the taxpayers spent
$22.4 billion without knowing it, and without knowing what they were
getting for it.
   What they got, when it was finally nosed heavenward in July, was
a strange, plastic bird that carries a smaller payload and probably
won't fly much higher, much farther or any faster than the Strategic
Air Command's old reliable, the B-52.
   The B-2 is 17 feet tall, 69 feet long and has a wingspan of 172
feet. It is powered by four General Electric F-118 engines,
virtually the same engines as used on the F-14 fighter but without
afterburners. Its range is 6,900 miles without refueling, and 11,500
miles with one midair refueling. It will have a maximum takeoff
weight of 350,000 pounds and be able to carry up to 50,000 pounds of
bombs or missiles, nuclear or conventional, 10,000 pounds less than
the B-52. Private experts estimate it will fly at altitudes of up to
55,000 feet at cruising speeds of mach 0.8 to 0.85, or about 530-560
mph.
   There's nothing especially dazzling about any of those numbers.
What is dazzling, presumably, is the stuff the Air Force won't talk
about _ the stealth technology, computerized flight controls,
``quiet'' on-board radar, and other electronic systems, possibly
employing fiber optics, designed to withstand the electromagnetic
interference generated by nuclear blasts.
   The Air Force wants to spend an additional $50 billion or so to
produce 132 of the planes designed by a company, Northrop, which for
years hadn't made a warplane other than a lightweight fighter, the
F-5.
   Former Pentagon procurement chief Robert B. Costello, who left as
undersecretary of defense in May, wanted to scuttle the program. In
an interview with The Washington Post, he said he told then-Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci last year that ``it's being brought to you
by the same company that brought you'' a series of troubled
programs, including guidance systems for the MX and air-launched
cruise missiles. ``What makes you think they'll do better (with the
B-2)?''
   Eight days after the B-2's maiden flight July 17, Pentagon and
congressional officials confirmed an investigation was under way by
the Justice Department's fraud unit concerning Northrop's billing
practices on the project. The company said it was unaware of the
probe.
   Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones says without reservation that
the B-2 is an ``extraordinary'' success. Defense Secretary Richard
B. Cheney calls it ``absolutely vital'' to strategic deterrence.
President Bush says doing without it would be ``devastating'' to
arms-control negotiations with the Soviets.
   The security and secrecy surrounding the project have been
phenomenal, perhaps rivaled only by elements of the Star Wars
program and the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb in
World War II. Northrop removed it from the rest of its own
organization, forming a new division called Advanced Products and
housing it at a closed auto plant in Pico Rivera, Calif. It
surrounded the plant, as well as the sister assembly complex at
Palmdale, Calif., with fences topped by razor wire.
   According to Costello, security has accounted for 5 percent of
the costs to date. With more than $22.4 billion spent so far, that
amounts to more than $1 billion.
   The tight security imposed additional costs. Efficiency suffered
from compartmentalization so severe some supervisors didn't know
what their subordinates were doing. ``I couldn't even ask,'' one
former Northrop official told the Los Angeles Times last year. ``For
all I knew, they were going to the movies every day.''
   Some could have. When employees were hired, they could not go
directly to work until their security clearances were finished. Many
were assigned for weeks to make-work jobs in an area of the plant
they nicknamed the ``drunk tank.''
   Unbeknownst to the public, the biggest snag occurred halfway
through the seven-year design period when the Air Force changed its
mind about the B-2's mission. The Pentagon originally ordered a
high-altitude bomber. Now it wanted one that could penetrate at low
levels as well, probably because it was fearful the Soviet Union was
developing the same new radar technology, called OTHB for Over the
Horizon Backscatter. The still super-secret radar system, the
Pentagon has privately acknowledged, offers new possibilities for
detecting stealth airplanes, though it is said to be ineffective
within 500 miles.
   Northrop's designers redesigned the wing for flight at lower
altitudes, where turbulence is greater. That took a year and another
$1 billion. An additional six-month delay was necessary for other
design changes, related especially to the engine inlets. In 1987,
two years before Congress began public debate over funding for the
B-2, the Pentagon moved its production schedule back two more years
in the face of Gramm-Rudman budget restrictions. Cheney has
postponed production yet another year; the Pentagon now hopes to
build all 132 planes by 1999, versus the original target of 1995.

   In 1986, then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger offered no
hint of the design delays and escalating costs when he testified
before Congress that the program ``is on schedule; the technology is
well-understood and working, and we expect the system to be
operational in the early 1990s.''
   Weinberger was also far off the mark when he offered Congress the
first public figures about the plane's cost. The B-2, he said, would
cost $277 million for each plane, and the entire program would tally
about $36.6 billion. Just two years later, the Pentagon went back to
Congress, weeks before the B-2's first test flight, with figures
roughly doubling Weinberger's: $530 million per plane, total program
cost of more than $70 billion.
   With those numbers now out in the open, some in Congress are
questioning whether the United States can afford the plane that Gen.
Bernard P. Randolph, head of the Air Force Systems Command, calls
nothing less than ``a quantum leap into the 21st century.''
   For all the secrecy surrounding the B-2's high-tech features,
there is no dark secret about either the stealth concept itself or
the flying-wing design. Each is nearly as old as powered flight.
   Simply put, the stealthiness of an airplane, or any other weapons
system, is measured by its ability to thwart an enemy's capacity to
detect it, by whatever means. It is a matter of degree _ there is no
such thing as total stealth; pure invisibility remains the exclusive
domain of science fiction.
   Hauptmann Petrocz von Petroczy probably qualified as the inventor
of the stealth airplane when, at a time when the unaided human eye
was the principal aerial tracking device, he removed the fabric
covering of an Etrich Taube monoplane and replaced it with
transparent celluloid. The engine and skeleton still showed, but
residents of the Austrian countryside had to strain to make out the
wraith-like source of the noise generated by Petroczy's test flights.
   That was in 1912, two years before an Englishman, John W. Dunne,
took to the skies in an airplane with no tail, no fuselage _ the
first flying wing. Aircraft designers, from Hugo Junkers to John W.
Northrop, have been entranced by its possibilities, despite repeated
setbacks, ever since.

   The first ``stealth'' test of Northrop's
flying-wing jet bomber was a remarkable success. Trouble was, four
decades ago, nobody much cared.
   Shortly before the Air Force canceled its order for the strange
YB-49, the late 1940s forerunner to the B-2, Northrop test pilot Max
Skelton flew a grand tour of air defense stations in the West.
   ``Nobody found him _ until he was directly overhead,'' says
flying-wing historian Tim Wooldridge of the National Air and Space
Museum. ``So even then, the Air Force knew that that kind of
airplane was difficult to detect. The sad part is that they didn't
continue the testing.''
   Eventually, the lesson began to take hold, though the Air Force
still wouldn't bring itself to embrace the flying-wing design for
decades. Speed and manueverability remained paramount objectives
through the 1950s and '60s, though stealthiness gradually moved
higher on the priority list.
   Despite representations of the B-2 and its fighter counterpart,
the F-117A, as the only stealth aircraft in the world, the
anti-radar technology has been honed and shared by many other planes
in the U.S. arsenal, some of which remain even more secret than the
B-2 itself. The aging U-2 spy plane and its successor, the SR-71
Blackbird, featured composite coatings. The B-1 and the F-117A
represent advances in wing and body blending as well as the
radar-absorbent materials on their skins.
   Contrary to popular belief, the marriage of stealth technology
with the flying wing, with its slender and hence naturally stealthy
profile, also goes back decades, dating almost to the birth of radar.
   Sir Robert Watson-Watt, the British radar pioneer, said as early
as 1935 that the aerial defense applications of his new technology
could be stymied by future bombers designed to reduce their radar
reflectivity. He and other engineers recognized that stealth would
have not so much to do with the size of the airplane, but with its
shape and the materials used to cover it.
   In World War II, as the United States and Great Britain
aggressively improved radar technology, German scientists led the
way in exploring methods to counter it _ including coatings designed
to absorb, rather than reflect, radar energy. These radar-absorbent
materials, or RAM for short, were first used to shield the snorkels
of German submarines from detection by radar-equipped aircraft. Too
late, really, the engineers turned their attention to their own
aircraft.
   Almost by happenstance, Britain had already delivered a painful
lesson to the Third Reich about bombers and stealth technology.
Early in the war, the tiny de Havilland Company had answered the
panic call for virtually anything that would fly by building a
cheap, two-engine machine out of plywood, spruce and balsa. It was
initially scoffed at, but the Mosquito, which carried nary a
defensive gun, had the lowest loss rate of any World War II bomber
thanks to its speed, flying altitude and the nearly invisible
flicker it produced on radar screens.
   That lesson in mind, the brothers Walter and Reimar Horten,
working with a super-secret Luftwaffe group known as Sonderkommando
9, set out to build a super-Mosquito, one even stranger in design.
They came up with a flying wing, powered by two jet engines buried
behind the cockpit. But too late: The HoIX, the only prototype to
fly, in early 1945, was destroyed when one of the engines failed; a
never-flown copy rests at the National Air and Space Museum's
storage complex at Silver Hill, Md.
   ``It is a remarkably clean-looking airplane,'' says Wooldridge, a
museum official and the author of ``Winged Wonders: The Story of
Flying Wings.''
   The test models were covered with plywood, but production
versions were to have a skin mixing plywood, sawdust, charcoal and
glue _ a compound expressly intended to absorb radar waves. The
Hortens had built a high-load-bearing plane combining jet power, the
low-profile shape of the flying wing and integral RAM. It was the
B-2 of its day.
   More frightening to contemplate is how the war might have turned
if Germany had managed to deploy a larger model that the Hortens had
actually started to assemble in April 1945, the HoXVIII. It was an
enormous, six-jet flying-wing bomber, designed to fly at least 7,400
miles with an 8,000-pound bombload. Were it not for Hitler's
imminent defeat, that aircraft, rivaling the size of the B-2, might
have flown to bomb New York City or Washington.
   Unlike Germany's rocket scientists, the Horten brothers were
rebuffed in their bid to pursue their breakthroughs for the Allies
after the war. Most U.S. warplane manufacturers focused on the
obvious alternatives to stealth for making their craft less
vulnerable _ more speed, higher altitudes, heavier armor and
on-board defenses.
   Meanwhile, Jack Northrop, the founder and longtime design leader
of the California company that bears his name, waged a lonely
campaign for something entirely different _ though the Horten
brothers, headed for virtual exile in Argentina, would not have
thought it so.

   Aircraft designer Jack Northrop's dream for more
than three decades was a jet that would combine the flying wing
design with ``stealth'' technology, making it virtually impossible
for enemy radar to detect. The B-2 stealth bomber flew its maiden
voyage this summer, and the pending decision on whether to begin
full-scale production will help determine the face of American air
power into the next century.

   Jack Northrop, the aircraft designer and
founder of the California company bearing his name, was obsessed
with the flying wing. But for more than three decades, the Air Force
shunned it as a flight of fancy.
   Then, in the end, it embraced Northrop's dream to build the B-2
``Stealth'' bomber, the world's most expensive airplane at current
estimates of $530 million apiece.
   Now Congress must decide whether the United States can afford to
build a plane the military says it can't afford to do without.
   Northrop long ago regarded the stealthy characteristics of the
flying wing _ chiefly, its reduced liklihood of being detected by
radar _ as a side benefit, a nice selling point to the military, for
what he believed was the most sensible way to build any airplane. A
flying wing has more lift and far less drag than a conventional
airplane of the same weight. It therefore is more efficient, meaning
it requires less power and less fuel, and can carry a greater
payload.
   ``Any reasonable assumptions,'' Northrop said in 1947, ``will
always result in advantage to the all-wing configuration, of such
magnitude as to fully warrant whatever trials and tribulations may
be involved in its development.''
   In 1981, as the headlines focused on Ronald Reagan's resurrection
of the B-1 program canceled by Jimmy Carter, Jack Northrop, then
retired and near death, was given a special security clearance so
Pentagon officials could deliver some news he had wanted to hear 34
years earlier. The Air Force had finally contracted with the company
bearing his name to build a flying wing as the nation's flagship
strategic bomber.
   Long before the public got its first glimpse of the B-2, Air
Force Chief of Staff Larry Welch declared that ``the aerodynamic
design ... is markedly more efficient than that of its
predecessors.'' The B-2, he continued, ``requires far fewer tankers
... and carries a very healthy bomb load. It would be a superb
bomber even if it weren't stealthy.''
   Aside from military considerations, some aviation buffs are
rooting for full development and production of the B-2 because of
its potential spin-offs for commercial flight. According to Tim
Wooldridge of the National Air and Space Museum, airlines and air
transport companies have long flirted with the notion of an all-wing
design for ``span-loaders'' that could fly tremendous distances
carrying huge weights _ oil, for example. ``But nobody's willing to
bet the billions of dollars it would cost'' for feasibility
research, he notes. ``What airline would bet that kind of money?''
   To some in Congress, the billions that will be needed to build a
fleet of B-2's look like a questionable bet, as well.
   By current estimates, each one will cost about $530 million. Put
another way, a single B-2 will cost $100 million more than Toronto's
spectacular Skydome, the world's newest and fanciest sports stadium,
replete with hotel, restaurants and retractable roof. The extra $100
million would buy a major league baseball team.
   ``The Department of Defense has produced a B-2 program that won't
fly financially,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee. ``Members of Congress are balking at
spending $4.1 billion this year for the Strategic Defense
Initiative. It is not realistic to think we can spend twice as much
per year on a plane.''
   ``This was the worst kind of public policy,'' said Rep. John R.
Kasich, R-Ohio. ``To keep something secret all this time and drive
the cost up to $22 billion (to date) will never be tolerated again.''
   The Air Force rejects such criticism, suggesting that some
members of Congress are being coy with their constituents now that
the cost estimates are public after eight years of top-secret
development. ``The charge that someone was hiding anything from the
Congress is ludicrous,'' said Larry Welch, the Air Force chief of
staff. ``There were dozens and dozens of people in the Congress who
were fully aware of all the details.''
   But Rep. Myke Synar, D-Okla, said, ``I attended classified
briefings by the Air Force and by Northrop which frankly left a lot
to be desired. They were not straightforward, they were not candid
and, in many ways, they were very confusing.''
   Synar charged that Northrop had ``miserably failed to manage this
program.'' Former Pentagon procurement chief Robert B. Costello
agreed, saying he had ``serious and grave concerns'' about
Northrop's management, and that the firm's quality controls were
``terrible.''
   Northrop's chairman, Thomas V. Jones, vigorously defended the
company and the airplane in a meeting with shareholders, saying the
program had produced an ``extraordinary new aircraft system'' and
``unprecedented technical successes.''
   The nation's first B-2 bomber made its public debut this summer,
18 months later than scheduled. It taxied slowly from its hanger at
Northrop's plant in Palmdale, Calif., and turned onto runway 04 the
morning of July 17. Chief Northrop test pilot Bruce J. Hinds, who
hadn't been able to tell even his wife he had been selected for the
honor, ran up the plane's four General Electric engines and released
the brakes at 9:36 a.m. EDT. Twenty-three seconds later, the B-2 was
airborne.
   ``The aircraft was very stable; rock stable,'' Hinds reported
later. ``It's going to be a very easy airplane to fly.''
   But not to sell. Before the August congressional recess, the
House limited B-2 production to two planes next year and two the
year after that _ half what the Bush administration wants. It also
ordered the Pentagon to draw up a new and cheaper production
program. The Senate was kinder; it trimmed only $300 million from
the $4.7 billion sought by the president for the B-2 next year. A
compromise bill may be crafted next month.
   Meanwhile, the Air Force has scrambled to redefine the B-2's
mission and capability. Originally conceived as a purely strategic
bomber to seek out and destroy the Soviet Union's mobile missiles in
a nuclear war, it now is being promoted as a conventional brushfire
weapon as well.
   Gen. Bernard P. Randolph, head of the Air Force Systems Command,
argues that the B-2 would have been ideal, had it been available,
for the 1986 U.S. raid on Libya. ``Just three to four B-2s could
have done the job directly from stateside bases,'' Randolph said.
   That's a remarkable switch in Air Force thinking. When the raid
was planned by a young Marine lieutenant colonel named Oliver North,
he inquired about having the already operational F-117A stealth
fighter-bomber do the job, according to Sweetman.
   The Air Force turned North down cold, saying the plane was too
valuable to risk on such a venture.
   The question arises: if that is true of the F-117, thought to
cost about $100 million per plane, why wouldn't it be true of the
B-2, at more than half a billion dollars?

   Colstrip, Mont., spends $5,148 per pupil. The district's
6-year-old high school is flush with computers, up-to-date labs,
even a greenhouse and indoor pool.
   This eastern Montana district, with a tax base enriched by the
presence of four power plants, offers high school pupils several
foreign languages and such electives as zoology, microbiology and
geology.
   Superior, in the western end of the state, spends about $3,000
per pupil. The newest school building is 28 years old. There are no
science electives beyond basic biology, chemistry and physics, in
labs described as ``woefully inadequate'' by former superintendent
William Donahue.
   Indoor swimming pools or greenhouses like in Colstrip?
   ``Those would be dreams,'' said Donahue.
   Such contrasts between rich and poor districts, endemic to
virtually every state, put school finance at the top of the
education reform agenda this past year.
   As 43 million children prepare for a new school year, an
Associated Press survey found 11 states defending against lawsuits
brought by parents or school districts challenging the
constitutionality of school funding systems _ systems that critics
have long held discriminate against those living in communities with
lower property tax revenues.
   ``While many people talk about the importance of educational
reform, children in low-wealth districts would be helped a lot just
to be brought to where high-spending districts now are,'' said
Arthur Wise, a school finance expert at The RAND Corporation, a
Washington think-tank.
   States with active lawsuits or court orders concerning school
finance are Alaska, Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota,
Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee and Texas.
   A coalition of poor Alabama districts says it will probably sue
that state this fall.
   In Florida, 22 districts sued the state in 1986. The state won a
summary judgment in 1987.
   Montana, under court order since February to reform its funding
system, held a special legislative session this summer, which
boosted state education spending by $61 million but which critics
say failed to solve the equity problems.
   Oklahoma legislators likewise met in special session this summer
to consider sweeping proposals by Gov. Henry Bellmon that would
substitute income and other taxes for much of the school property
tax. They recessed last week without taking action.
   The equity issue has reasserted itself in the school reform
agenda this year for several reasons. Chiefly, many state funding
systems are simply out-of-date, formulated in the early 1970s during
the last great wave of school finance reform.
   ``In many states, you have a finance system dating from the early
1970s. You still have that system in 1989 when the school
expectations, the demographics and the economics are all different.
You can take me to any state from Michigan to Iowa to Montana, and I
could tell you that same story,'' said Kent McGuire who follows such
money matters for the Education Commission of the States in Denver.
   And school reform, with its mandates requiring rich and poor
districts alike to fund smaller classes, higher teacher pay and
other costly measures, has pushed many small, tax-poor districts to
their financial limits.
   ``It's clear that as the reform agenda moves on, that's anted up
the cost,'' McGuire said.
   In many states, the school finance issue is pitting rural
districts with poor tax bases against bigger, wealthier ones. With
farm values declining and fewer children interested in pursuing
agricultural careers, the quality of schools in rural districts has
become a more urgent concern.
   In North Dakota, nine school districts and 48 parents filed suit
in June, claiming the state's system of providing aid to schools is
unconstitutional.
   A school district's ability to finance eduction is ``unfairly and
inequitably linked'' to its property wealth, said Calvin Rolfson, a
Bismarck attorney representing the plaintiffs.
   In Texas, where a lawsuit brought by a group of smaller districts
is pending before the state Supreme Court, lead attorney Al Kauffman
said, ``They have no chemistry, no physics, no calculus, foreign
language, pre-kindergarten, or college prep, no extra-curricular, no
band, choir, football, no debate. They have 96 percent low-income
students. Those students are not being given a chance in this
society.''
   ``We've managed to just squeak by year after year,'' said Antonio
Parra, a spokesman for the San Elizario school district. ``But
taxpayers in our school district will probably face another tax
increase. How long can you stretch a rubber band?''
   In Connecticut, Oregon and New Jersey, by contrast, the poor
children suing the state live in metro areas.
   The non-profit Education Law Center, in a suit on behalf of 20
school-aged children in Camden, Irvington, East Orange and Jersey
City, N.J., won its first victory last summer when Administrative
Law Judge Steven Lefelt ruled that the 1975 state formula for
funding public education has failed and is unconstitutional.
   In a scathing ruling, Lefelt found that poorer, urban districts
are overcrowded, have fewer teachers, poor equipment, decaying
buildings, and more limited course offerings than wealthy suburban
districts.
   State education commissioner Saul Cooperman has rejected those
findings, as has Gov. Thomas H. Kean who dismissed Lefelt's ruling
as ``an interesting liberal treatise.'' The state Supreme Court is
scheduled to hear arguments Sept. 25.
   In Connecticut, where the state is being sued by a group of urban
schoolchildren and parents, assistant superintendent Daniel Shamas
in Bridgeport said his district fights a constant budget battle.
   Bridgeport spends $5,431 per year on each of its 19,270 students.
Affluent Westport, just 10 miles away, spends $8,299 per pupil.
   ``If you look at the state as a whole, you see two
Connecticuts,'' one rich and one poor, Shamas said. ``If you look at
what we're spending per pupil and what other (more wealthy) towns
are spending, that tells the whole story.''
   Westport Schools Comptroller Frederick J. Nigri rejects the
argument that rich and poor towns offer substantially different
educational opportunities.
   ``For the basic educational program, a child can get a great deal
out of a big-city system if they're motivated,'' Nigri said. ``We
may have some better enrichment programs, perhaps a little better
drama program, but I like to think there's some education equality.''
   While not yet the subject of a lawsuit in Michigan, school
finance has become one of that state's thorniest issues. After
failing to solve the problem, the legislature has placed two
competing referendums for voters to decide in November. One would
raise some $400 million in school funds with a sales tax hike; the
other would hike sales taxes by $468 million but offer $1.3 billion
in property-tax relief.
   ``There has never been a time that I've been told by the
districts and educators that we've provided enough money,'' said Ken
Nelson, a legislator in Minnesota where 48 school districts have
filed suit claiming that state's funding formula is unfair. ``Nobody
knows what really is enough money. That's a judgment call.''

   Under the Manhattan skyline, below Times Square,
directly south of the World Trade Center, lies a world of which most
New Yorkers remain blissfully unaware _ until disaster strikes.
   Last weekend's Gramercy Park steam pipe blast that killed three
people focused attention on the world beneath Manhattan, where
rivers run through ancient pipes, kilowatts crackle across a vast
net of lines and the homeless find refuge from the winter freeze.
   ``It's hard to determine what happened. Nobody really knows what
goes on under there,'' said Tina Casey, spokeswoman for the city
Department of Environmental Protection, as officials searched for a
cause in the fatal explosion.
   Consider what's down there and you can see why she's right.
   On any given day, more people ride beneath Manhattan than reside
atop it; 3 million people ride the subway, 108,000 travel under the
East River on the Long Island Rail Road, 105,000 use the PATH trains
beneath the Hudson River, 95,000 take the train tunnels of
Metro-North.
   Most of them never know they share the space with 11,209,507
miles of telephone wire; 19,000 miles of electric cable; 6,800 miles
of gas pipes; 6,000 miles of water mains; 106 miles of steam pipe,
and 100 miles of cable TV wiring _ all packed into the island's 23
square miles.
   Manhattan runs over, under and alongside 214.6 miles of subway
tunnels. Thousands of TA workers spend their days, and nights,
underground keeping the system running; the LIRR, Metro-North,
Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the PATH systems all face similar
tasks on a smaller scale.
   ``It really is astounding. If you ever took a tour, there's
tunnels, walkways... A small train used to deliver Gloria
Vanderbilt's luggage beneath the Waldorf-Astoria,'' said Dan
Brucker, spokesman for Metro-North railroad, which operates on 48
acres under Grand Central Station.
   ``It's unbelievable. There's literally an entire world going
around down there.''
   A world with an assortment of oddities, including:
   _Two multi-million dollar subway tunnels that have never seen a
single train or commuter, both beneath Second Avenue.
   _A half-dozen abandoned train stations, one of them outside City
Hall, dating back to 1904.
   _A wine cellar-turned-holding pen for suspected criminals beneath
Grand Central.
   _A data management company, Datacom, operating 10 stories beneath
the World Trade Center, sharing space with 54,000 tons of
refrigeration units and six 1,000-kilowatt emergency generators.
   As long as everything works, nobody notices. But there are
problems: water main breaks (604 in the year ending June 30), subway
derailments (nine this year, down from a high of 21 in 1981),
blackouts (last biggie: 1977).
   The likelihood of such events is a constant worry, in part due to
the age of the unseen city. Half the water system, made mostly of
cast iron, was installed near the turn of the century; some
telephone wires date to the Roaring '20s; the oldest gas and
electric lines were put in during World War II.
   And each affects whatever's nearby. This down-under domino effect
crippled a 20-block section of the garment district in the summer of
1983, when a 12-inch water main burst beneath Herald Square, spewing
water into a power substation and igniting an underground inferno.
   The area, including Macy's and Gimbel's, was blacked out for
three days. The potential for disaster is worse; the largest water
mains in service measure 72 inches across.
   Last year, a main laid in 1898 ruptured, flooding Columbus Circle
near Central Park and knocking out train service for 200,000
commuters. This year, several thousand commuters were trapped
underground when an emergency cord was yanked on a subway and trains
backed up for hours.
   For some New Yorkers, the labyrinth of twisting tunnels provides
a temporary home. Beneath Grand Central, where some of the city's
thousands of homeless people seek relief from the elements, are 56
miles of steam pipes and 34 miles of tunnel running three levels
deep.
   Metro-North police patrol the station's underbelly but rarely
find such people, said Brucker.
   ``The only thing you find down there in great numbers,'' he said,
``is rats.''
   Not exactly. There's gold under the streets: in five years, the
city has collected $13.2 million in tax assessments on underground
vaults once used to store coal in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The Swiss
Bank Corp. keeps billions in bullion in its vaults in lower
Manhattan.
   The city runs deepest where it stands tallest: beneath the
110-story twin towers of the World Trade Center. Down there,
restaurants, including the elegant Windows on the World, prepare
food; the Port Authority police take target practice, all 1,452 of
them each year, and trucks make deliveries via the old PATH train
tunnels.
   ``Welcome to the catacombs,'' said a smiling Carl Durr, who's
spent 11 years working beneath the buildings, baking cakes and rolls
for unknowing diners dozens of stories above.
   Durr says he doesn't mind spending each working day underground,
and he's not alone in his feelings.
   ``They wanted me on the 106th floor. I told them I wouldn't go,''
said Mike Linz, who oversees the Inhilco Inc. food operation. ``The
only thing I do different down here is call my wife before I leave
and find out what the weather's like.''
   As constant as the climate-controlled WTC work space are the
rumors of alligators scrambling through Manhattan's 6,000-plus miles
of sewer pipes. Persistent tales of reptiles roaming the sewers even
gave rise to a movie, ``Alligator!,'' released several years ago.
   ``People are always talking about alligators in the sewer
system,'' sighed George Watford of the ASPCA, which rescues about a
half-dozen dogs and cats from beneath the city each year. ``We don't
see anything like that.''

   Mahmoud El-Abed Ahmad is an American citizen; he
is charged with no crimes in this country.
   But for more than two years, he has languished in a Manhattan
jail as governments and lawyers argue whether he can get a fair
trial in Jerusalem, where he is considered a ``dangerously violent''
member of the brutal Abu Nidal terror network.
   Israeli and American authorities believe Ahmad was a prime
participant in a 1986 attack on a bus outside Tel Aviv that killed
the driver and injured three Jewish settlers.
   But Ahmad's lawyer, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
insists his client is an innocent man, illegally kidnapped from
South America by the FBI. Clark says an Israeli Shin Beth security
squad tortured two of Ahmad's cousins until they implicated him in
the bus attack.
   ``Of all the cruel and unusual punishment you could be subjected
to, perhaps the worst is to be convicted of a crime you didn't
commit,'' says Clark.
   ``If the only evidence they have is a confession that is
inherently unreliable, taken by torture of another person that
cannot be objectively examined, there's no justice, search for trial
or truth,'' he argues.
   The governments of Israel and the United States, which initially
lost the right to extradite Ahmad but regained it on appeal only to
have it challenged again, insist they have indisputable evidence
linking the 36-year-old man to the attack.
   Over 28 months, a parade of legal experts and personalities has
traveled to the federal courthouse in downtown Brooklyn to give
their opinions why Ahmad should or shouldn't be forced back to
Israel.
   Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor and legal writer,
appeared for prosecutors and argued the fairness of Israel's courts.
But the noted Israeli civil-rights lawyer and anti-Zionist Leah
Tsemel says physical and emotional torture are commonly used in
Israel to force prisoners to say what the authorities want to hear.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein is considering a writ of
habeas corpus filed by Clark and a decision could come next month. A
habeas writ puts the burden of proof on the federal authorities to
justify Ahmad's continued detention.
   Ms. Tsemel, born in Jerusalem several years before the nation of
Israel was founded, represents hundreds of Palestinians and other
Arabs whose rights are allegedly routinely trampled by Israeli
security forces trying to maintain control of the Occupied
Territories, seized in 1967.
   ``There is a stage where it's mistreatment, and then it becomes
torture,'' she says of interrogation by the Israeli security force
Shin Beth. ``I don't think all the security services men are
sadists. I think they have a target _ they want a confession.''
   Should Weinstein decide for the government, he could well
sentence Ahmad to such treatment while condemning him to prisons
that are ``considered among the worst in the world,'' Ms. Tsemel
told the judge.
   Shin Beth does have a nasty reputation, Dershowitz concedes, but
he asserts his studies of the Israeli legal system have found the
perception to be largely hype designed to intimidate recalcitrant
Palestinian suspects.
   Israeli interrogators ``rely very heavily on the fear that things
are going to be a lot worse than they are at the interview,'' he
says. ``Both sides have reason for wanting it to be believed that
interrogated subjects are tortured.''
   The state attorney for Israel, Dorit Beinish, insists Ahmad _
charged with murder, attempted murder, attempted arson and other
crimes _ will be treated fairly, tried in civil court by a
three-judge panel and will not be held under the harsh conditions
common in the jails of the Occupied Territories.
   Ahmad, whom Israeli authorities sometime refer to as Mahmoud Abed
Atta, is charged with taking part in an April 12, 1986, attack in
which three men _ allegedly Ahmad and his two cousins _ hurled
Molotov cocktails and then opened fire with machine guns on a bus
carrying Jewish settlers in the Occupied West Bank.
   Ahmad was born in the West Bank town of Ramala and became a U.S.
citizen seven years ago. His last job was working at his brother's
filling station in Puerto Rico. According to travel documents, he
was visiting his family near Ramala at the time of the attack, but
he denies involvement.
   A month later, when his visa expired, Ahmad left Israel and
traveled to Europe and then New York in an unsuccessful effort to
get a visa extension so he could return to Ramala, where his wife
and children were living, Clark said in an interview.
   Ahmad then went to Venezuela. For the next several months, as
Israeli authorities mounted an international search for him, Ahmad
made frequent trips to Spain, Cyprus, Colombia and Mexico to address
Palestinian gatherings.
   He was arrested entering Caracas on April 27, 1987, but because
Venezula has no extradition treaty with Israel he was handed over _
illegally, Clark asserts _ to the FBI. Agents hustled him onto a
flight to New York, and U.S. authorities arrested him once he was
within American jurisdiction. Since then he has been held without
bail at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.
   Ahmad was likely involved in the attack, a federal magistrate and
a federal judge in Brooklyn agree; but they are at odds over what
should be done with him.
   In June 1988, Magistrate John L. Caden ruled the attack on the
bus a ``political objective'' and thus outside the jurisdiction of
the U.S.-Israel extradition treaty. He also said the way the FBI
nabbed Ahmad and put him in an American jail was unconstitutional.
   U.S. District Judge Edward R. Korman later reversed Caden in a
sharply worded ruling saying the magistrate applied ``erroneous
legal standards'' and ``his findings of fact are plainly erroneous.''
   Korman's ruling that Ahmad could be returned to Israel was
immediately challenged and is under review by Weinstein.

<HEAD>Life With the Wolves From a Unique View _ Inside the Pack</HEAD>

   A lonely howl pierces the prairie as
three wolves prance into a sun-baked field, ready to dance with an
unlikely partner.
   The wolves circle the bison, inching closer, seeking a sign of
weakness or sickness. There are none. Within minutes, the silent
standoff ends. Predator and prey go their separate ways.
   Welcome to another day at Wolf Park, a remote patch of corn
country claiming to be the only place of its kind where the
interaction of wolves and bison in captivity is studied.
   At the 75-acre park, humans raise wolves _ bottle-feeding,
cuddling and sleeping beside them in their infancy _ study their
behavior, witness their rare dominance fights and teach people that
the animals are neither cuddly creatures nor the epitome of evil
seen in horror movies.
   ``People tend to have two kinds of prejudice against wolves _ a
negative one where it's a bad animal that kills for fun,'' said Pat
Goodmann, a research associate. ``Then there's a positive prejudice
where wolves can do no wrong. The truth lies somewhere in the
middle.''
   The man who dispels the myths is Erich Klinghammer, a
bespectacled, silver-bearded native of Germany who founded the park
in 1972 when allergies forced him to abandon his dove and pigeon
research.
   ``The wolf is a symbol of the vanishing wilderness,'' said
Klinghammer, an associate professor of psychological sciences at
Purdue University. ``If kept in captivity, it should be an
ambassador for its species.''
   The wolves are just that on Friday nights during summer and fall,
when people come to exchange howls with the animals, the cries
rippling across the moonlit fields. On Sundays, folks can witness
dramatic beast-vs.-beast faceoffs when a few wolves are taken to the
bison pasture to test their vulnerability.
   Often, it's little more than a staring match: the shaggy, brown
bison glare impassively from huge heads framed by manes of thick
hair.
   ``The wolf is an opportunist,'' said Klinghammer. ``It's like
muggers or a purse-snatcher who go after people with a sign of
weakness. If an opportunity arises they think they can take an
animal, they will. They attack when the odds are in their favor. ...
A healthy bison is hard to put down.''
   Klinghammer, a zoo consultant and expert on dog and wolf
behavior, defends this experiment. It causes no stress, he says, and
can help farmers protect cattle from wolves and provide clues to how
bison deal with their young.
   No animals have been seriously injured in nine years. ``The
wolves have never been hurt beyond what we couldn't kiss and make
better,'' Goodmann said.
   What's more, at any sign of danger the wolves can be distracted
or stopped. If there's any indication of weakness, the bison will be
removed and tended.
   Wolves have a keen sense for weakness. Once a wolf tested a bison
for about 20 minutes. A week later, the bison developed pneumonia.
``I suspect the wolf could hear (breathing problems) before we could
see any clinical signs the animal was sick,'' Klinghammer said.
   Though learning about wolves is part of his mission, Klinghammer
also wants to teach people the animals aren't good pets.
   A tragic example is Mickey, a wolf brought to the park after it
killed a boy in the Michigan back yard where it was tied up, treated
as a pet. When the boy approached, Mickey ``knocked the kid over
because he wanted to greet him,'' Klinghammer said. ``He was lonely.
The child struggled and cried. That's the sound of wounded prey and
he killed him.''
   Unlike Mickey, the other 20 wolves were born at the park. They're
taken from their mothers in the first weeks, bottle-fed and nurtured
by men and women so they adjust to both. Staffers get an
inside-the-pack view, sleeping on mattresses next to their charges.
   In the early weeks, the cubs are reunited periodically with their
elders. ``They need to see adult wolves,'' Klinghammer said.
``They're very fearful. They have to remember what big wolves look
like so they feel safe.''
   The adults adapt, lowering their heads and tails _ body language
that won't frighten the cubs. ``It's an inhibition about hurting
babies. It's instinctive. They're very solicitous of the babies. The
males, too. They're good family animals.''
   Each park wolf has a name _ there's Mephisto, Faust and Imbo,
among others. And each has a place in the pack, where the dominant
male and female are dubbed the ``alpha'' members. In this stratified
world, a wolf can go from leader to outcast. ``Those are the
fortunes of war,'' Klinghammer said.
   Life can be cruel for the wolf at the bottom, the ``omega,'' who
often is harassed or harmed. ``It's like the child in the school
everyone picks on. In the wild, they would become loners. In
captivity, we have them removed.''
   Two are now isolated at the park, which is operated by the North
American Wildlife Park Foundation.
   Another bitter and potentially fatal fact of the wolf's world is
the rare dominance fight. One sister once killed another at the park.
   ``All social animals will fight for rank, in many cases, kill for
it,'' Klinghammer said. ``That's certainly true for humans.''
   Despite the tragedies, his affection for wolves has grown since
the day decades ago when he was overcome with emotion at the sight
of his first two, while horseback riding in Nebraska.
   ``Running a wolf park on a shoestring, sometimes you wish you
could chuck it all,'' he said. ``Then you look at the wolves ... and
that's what keeps you going. ... It's a spiritual thing, almost.''

   Lou VanWert used to amaze her friends by
throwing her shoulder out of joint with just the slightest movement.
   That was before she knew her tricks were symptoms of a
little-known genetic disorder that probably plagued many circus
contortionists.
   ``My father called me a bag of bones,'' said VanWert, 65, of
Williamsville, N.Y. ``But nobody ever thought anything of it.''
   The hereditary disease is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome _ in slang
terms, the ``human pretzel disease.'' Its sufferers have defective
collagen, a protein found in connective tissue.
   VanWert, who was diagnosed in her late 30s, has watched closely
as five of her eight grandchildren developed mild symptoms. She
chides her granddaughter when she contorts her body because such
stunts can make the disease worse.
   VanWert joined about 80 other patients, doctors and researchers
this month at the second annual conference of the Ehlers-Danlos
National Foundation. One of the organizers was Susan Stephenson, a
Richmond nurse who started the group four years ago with Nancy
Rogowski, a Southgate, Mich., secretary.
   The foundation, Stephenson said, is trying to find Ehlers-Danlos
sufferers and inform doctors how to look for symptoms of the
disease. ``People are diagnosed oftentimes at autopsy with our
disease,'' she said.
   Stephenson, 35, found out she had Ehlers-Danlos 10 years ago. The
discovery followed years of pain in her feet and knees, numerous
operations and countless appointments with doctors baffled by her
symptoms. ``All they ever told my parents was that I had very loose
joints and I bruised very easily.''
   Her joints were so loose that she could turn over in bed and
dislocate a kneecap, a shoulder or a collarbone.
   After undergoing surgery three times in five months to relieve
her pain, Stephenson started going to medical libraries to try to
find a disease that fit her symptoms. Her research led her to Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, where an orthopedic surgeon
correctly diagnosed her.
   ``It's a very underdiagnosed disorder,'' said Catherine A.
Stolle, an assistant professor of molecular biology at the Robert
Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J. ``If you can be
diagnosed earlier, you can make choices, lifestyle choices that
avoid certain twisting motions, heavy burdens, heavy loads that will
do more damage to the joints.''
   Stolle said her research is aimed at developing a test to
diagnose the syndrome in young children. A prenatal test is another
goal.
   There is no cure, but some sufferers can be helped by surgery or
large amounts of vitamin C, Stephenson said.
   There are at least 11 variations of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, some
mild and others that can be crippling or fatal. An estimated 1 in
5,000 to 1 in 20,000 people are born with the affliction. The
foundation has 565 members in this country and 32 in nine foreign
countries, Stephenson said.
   VanWert, who wears a leg brace, and Stephenson, who uses a
wheelchair, said it has helped them to meet people who share their
chronic pain and sleepless nights.
   ``You think you're the only one in the world,'' VanWert said,
``especially when the medical profession thinks you're nuts.''
   ``They don't understand your pain,'' Stephenson said. ``If you
make it through a few consecutive days without a joint dislocating,
that is a major feat.''

<HEAD>Scientists Say Hydroden is Fuel of the Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IKE FLORES</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The search for an oil substitute has
lost much of its urgency, but researchers in Florida, Texas and
Hawaii believe they are getting closer to the day when hydrogen is
as common as gasoline.
   They view hydrogen as the fuel of the future, a replacement for
all fossil fuels _ not only in cars but in the home, in industry and
elsewhere.
   ``The arguments for development of hydrogen resources are
irrefutable,'' said David Block, director of the Florida Solar
Energy Center, one of the four facilities trying to come up with
methods to produce hydrogen inexpensively on a large scale, use it
to generate power, and store it.
   Hydrogen is one of the most abundant elements. It can be
separated from its chemical combinations _ like water _ in a number
of ways. It won't pollute the environment and in fact, scientists
working on the project say, can help stave off the global warming
blamed in part on the effect of burning fossil fuels.
   Perhaps the best-known use is on space shuttles, which burn
385,000 gallons of supercold liquid hydrogen, mixed with liquid
oxygen, to reach orbit.
   Participating in the federally funded research project with the
Florida Solar Energy Center are scientists at the Clean Energy
Research Institute at the University of Miami, the Center for
Electrochemical Systems and Hydrogen Research at Texas A&amp;M
University and the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute.
   ``Hydrogen can be produced now. The problem is that the cost is
prohibitive'' for everyday consumer use, said John Appleby, who
heads the Texas A&amp;M effort to use photovoltaic cell structures to
make hydrogen to use in cars. He, too, believes using hydrogen is
important to curtail the greenhouse effect.
   ``We feel that the way to go in the future would be nonpolluting
vehicles powered by fuel cells using hydrogen, to get rid of the
pollution once and for all,'' said Appleby, a professor of applied
electrochemistry. ``The cost would be reasonable to the consumer and
the cost to society wouldn't exist.''
   However, efforts to come up with an economically affordable
hydrogen fuel cell _ or produce hydrogen by a variety of other
methods _ ``will take forever. We're talking well after the year
2000,'' Appleby said.
   One problem is the government's lukewarm support, politically and
financially, for research efforts, some scientists say. While the
government says is is spending $30 million a year for hydrogen
research, only $2.4 million a year goes to the four institutions
seeking economical ways to produce a fuel.
   ``The rest of the money is for fusion reactors and involves
hydrogen isotopes,'' said Appleby. ``Fusion research has absolutely
nothing to do with fuel in the hands of the ordinary person.''
   Block believes there must be a gradual transition from gasoline
to hydrogen in automobiles, using combinations of various fuels
before there can be a total conversion to hydrogen. FSEC plans to
develop a vehicle fueled by a mixture of methane and hydrogen,
providing fuel economy, power and lower emission levels.
   FSEC scientists are studying a combination thermochemical and
electrochemical processes to produce the element economically. And
they are trying to identify the most promising of the
hydrogen-production technologies.
   Their work so far shows that separating water into its elements
of hydrogen and oxygen can best be accomplished using solar energy,
Block said.
   The Hawaiian facility is working on using biomass, or vegetation,
and ocean water as possible hydrogen production sources, among other
projects.
   Researchers at the University of Miami are devising ways to use
hydrogen, along with assessing the economics involved.
   Among the chief concerns of scientists involved in research and
development of alternative fuels are the uncertainties of future
supplies and costs of oil. But hydrogen supporters are increasingly
citing the greenhouse effect and acid rain as reasons for a strong
national effort to develop hydrogen as a fuel.
   The burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal is steadily
releasing massive amounts of carbon and other heat-trapping gases
into the atmosphere. Some scientists say this may eventually lead to
a climatic catastrophe.
   ``If we want a planet worth saving in 50 years,'' Block said,
``We've got to find a suitable replacement for fossil fuels.''

<HEAD>UK Sets Up National Pilot Program to Train Family Doctors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical students at the University of
Kentucky will combine the fourth year of school with the first year
of residency under a pilot program aimed at producing more family
practitioners for the state.
   ``We need them badly,'' said Dr. Nicholas J. Pisacano, executive
director of the American Board of Family Practice, which approved
the program that cuts training from seven years to six. ``Several
schools and some of the top medical educators in the country are
watching it carefully.
   ``The program has the portent of revolutionizing medical
education in the United States. If not, we'll document its failure.''
   Three UK College of Medicine students entered the program July 1.
``They will be monitored continuously all year to see if they met
the criteria and standards,'' said Pisacano. ``We won't certify any
second-class people.''
   According to a study of students graduating from the UK and
University of Louisville medical schools from 1976-79, 75 percent of
the Kentucky graduates that stayed in the state for post-graduate
training now practice in the state.
   ``Ideally, those in the program will stay. It is highly likely
that they will,'' said Dr. Alan K. David, chairman of UK's Family
Practice Department.

<HEAD>Increased Sightings of Young Dolphins Encouraging Sign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEAUFORT, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increased sightings of dolphin calves in
the past three months is encouraging, but recovery from two years of
poisoning that killed hundreds of dolphins will be a slow process,
researchers say.
   ``Seeing more babies is a good sign, but these calves have to
grow up,'' said marine scientist Keith Rittmaster. Calves accounted
for almost 16 percent of the bottlenose dolphins seen along the
North Carolina coast, compared with 7.3 percent before the 1987-1988
``die-off'' whose cause is still debated.
   ``I think it's higher than has been recorded anywhere for the
bottlenose dolphins. I suspect the whole population is trying to
bounce back,'' he said.
   Because there is little data, it is impossible to say if dolphin
birth rates have increased elsewhere along the East Coast, said
Gerald P. Scott, of the National Marine Fisheries Service in Miami.
In fact, Scott predicted that dolphin births would drop over the
next few years because of the die-off.
   The dolphins found dead in 1987 and 1988 were of all age groups,
but a larger percentage of them were sexually immature _ 3 to 6
years old _ and their deaths could cost much of the next generation,
he said.
   About 750 dolphins washed ashore along the East Coast during that
time. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration blamed the
deaths on a toxin from red tide algae. Some scientists and
conservationists blame pollution.

   Like a doctor with a stethoscope, engineers
can listen to planes, oil tanks, tankers and pipelines for sounds of
impending disaster.
   ``If you have a bulkhead that breaks, it happens over a long
period. ... We don't listen merely to a crack; what we're doing is
getting the warning signals before they crack,'' said Sotirios
Vahaviolos of Physical Acoustics Corp.
   Vahaviolos' Princeton-based company tests equipment for Monsanto
Chemical Co., the Pentagon and the Soviet Union, among others, and
will begin tests next month on a Boeing 727 at the FAA Technical
Center in Pomona.
   The Federal Aviation Administration decided to take a new look at
the way commercial aircraft are inspected after a piece of an Aloha
Airlines jet failed and flew off last year shortly after the plane
was checked out.
   ``There has been a push for newer and improved technology to try
to ensure the structural integrity of old aircraft. We're looking at
a lot of areas _ X-ray techniques, ultrasonic imaging, acoustic
emissions _ to see what type of structural problems are best
discovered,'' said FAA engineer Tom DeFiore.
   After comparing the speed and effectiveness of various methods,
the FAA will recommend an inspection technique, DeFiore said.
   ``Our final goal is that you bring the plane on the gate in the
evening and we can tell in a couple of hours whether it is
airworthy,'' said Vahaviolos, who founded the company in 1978. One
test can cost $10,000 to $100,000.
   Physical Acoustics' techniques are already in practice for
corporate and private air carriers, said James Helms of Tramsport
Aircraft Technical Services Co., an Ojai, Calif.-based inspecton
services company. ``There is nothing wrong per se with current
technology. However, it's too error-prone when it's subject to
(deadline) pressure, when they have to get it done overnight.''
   Physical Acoustics places sensors on the plane's skin while it
goes through a series of pressurization cycles. Cracks or corrosion
emit sounds that can be analyzed by a computer. Wing joints are
tested by simply loading fuel.
   It has detected flaws from 10 inches to .05 inches, said
Vahaviolos.

   Disappointing second-quarter sales
prompted Eastman Kodak Co. to announce a reorganization that will
trim 4,500 jobs from its worldwide payroll this year.
   The photo company on Wednesday acknowledged the cuts were 3,500
jobs above what was previously forecast. Kodak employs 145,000
people worldwide.
   Kodak will also restructure or divest businesses with annual
revenues of $1.25 billion through sale, closure or reorganization,
the company said Wednesday.

   A brewery located in the heart of
Wisconsin's potato farming region says it has a spud for you.
   Stevens Point Brewery began selling a limited supply of Spud
Premier Beer, which is made from potato starch, on Wednesday through
major outlets in central Wisconsin.
   The brew's debut was timed to coincide with a Spud Bowl
fundraiser at the Univerity of Wisconsin next month, said Kenneth
Shilbilski, the brewery's president.
   ``Making beer from potato starch is something we've thought about
doing for a long time, but it took the Spud Bowl to give us the
reason,'' he said.
   Taste testers said Spud Beer has a slightly different flavor
compared with beer made from the usual brewing ingredients of corn
or rice.
   ``Whether you could classify it as a potato taste, I couldn't
say,'' said Phyllis Devlin of Stevens Point.

<HEAD>Kodak Announces Reorganization That Will Eliminate 4,500 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A restructuring plan announced by Eastman
Kodak Co. to bring in up to $1 billion in extra cash next year
probably won't involve the sale of major divisions, analysts say.
   Kodak officials said Wednesday that disappointing second-quarter
earnings prompted the reorganization, under which it will eliminate
4,500 jobs worldwide this year, or about 3 percent of its work
force, and sell or consolidate certain operations.
   The company, which employs 145,000 people worldwide, including
47,000 at its Rochester headquarters, previously announced plans to
cut 1,000 jobs this year. That figure is included in the new
cutbacks.
   Robert Welk, a Rochester-based economics consultant, said paring
the payroll is wise because Kodak has too many employees compared
with its competitors.
   ``They're addressing what has to be done,'' he said. ``It
definitely is going to be a different company.''
   ``It's not a massive restructuring,'' said Alex Henderson, an
analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``It's a major
belt-tightening, very much needed by Kodak.''
   Company spokesman Paul Allen could not provide specifics on where
the jobs would be eliminated.
   The reductions will be targeted at divisions with combined sales
of $1.25 billion, or about 7 percent of Kodak's overall $17 billion
in sales last year, officials said. Kodak said it would sell, close
or reorganize those businesses to reduce operating costs.
   The units most likely to be affected are smaller ones the company
started or bought in the 1980s, analysts said.
   Some have speculated its Information Systems operation, which
includes copiers and microfilm and graphics equipment, would be
targeted. That segment lost $144 million in the second quarter.
   David Nelson, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said
Kodak apparently is avoiding ``a fire sale of assets.'' But, he
added, ``You don't reassure your employees by leaving them to wonder
whether they're part of the $1.25 billion in businesses which are up
for grabs.''
   Kodak laid off about 13,000 workers in 1986 and 10,800 in 1983.
In both instances, profits rose substantially the next year.
   ``We have dealt with adversity in the past, but never with such
broad-based intensity,'' said Kodak's chairman and chief executive
officer, Colby Chandler. ``These uncharacteristic actions are being
carried out with great resolve by the entire management team.''
   Chandler said the restructuring should improve operating results
by up to $1 billion next year.
   At company headquarters, Kodak said it would freeze workers' pay
in 1990 except in special cases and change the pay structure of
managers so it will be linked more closely to financial results.
   Up to 40 percent of pay for top managers _ Chandler, President
Kay Whitmore and Vice Chairman J. Phillip Samper _ will be tied to
the company's financial performance.
   From 15 percent to 30 percent of the pay of other senior
executives and 15 percent of the pay of managers below the rank of
vice president also will be based on how well the company does,
Allen said.
   Chandler said divisions also would attack costs by cutting back
on excessive inventories and shortening the length of time between
sales and receipt of payment.
   On Aug. 1, the company announced earnings fell 85 percent in the
second quarter, to $60 million, or 18 cents a share, from a record
$390 million, or $1.20 a share, last year.
   For the first half of 1989, earnings fell 60 percent to $260
million, or 80 cents a share, from $650 million, or $2 a share, a
year earlier.
   Kodak announced the restructuring after the stock market closed
Wednesday. Its shares rose $1 to finish at $50.75 in active trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Miller, the new president of Wang
Laboratories Inc., may get the chief executive title as well if he
succeeds in turning around the hard-pressed computer maker, an
analyst says.
   ``He's the finest financially oriented executive I've met,'' said
James I. Magid, a senior adviser to the investment firm of Needham &amp;
Co. ``I would bet they would make Rick Miller chief executive in the
second profitable quarter, once he proves he can turn it.''
   Miller, 48, a veteran of Penn Central Corp. and the consumer
electronics businesses of RCA Corp. and General Electric Co., on
Wednesday was named president and chief operating officer of Lowell,
Mass.-based Wang.
   Wang portrayed him as a turnaround specialist who could help the
minicomputer company recover from last year's $424 million loss and
the defection of some nervous customers.
   Miller never has worked for a computer company, but An Wang, the
company's 69-year-old founder and chairman, praised him in a
statement that indicated Wang plans to give him a large degree of
independence.
   ``I have great confidence in the ability of Rick Miller to assume
total control of the operations of Wang Laboratories,'' Wang said.
``He will have my full support and that of the board of directors in
resolving the company's current situation and restoring it to
profitability.''
   Miller replaces Frederick Wang, the son and former heir apparent
of the founder, who resigned Aug. 8 as the company's financial
troubles mounted. Harry H.S. Chou served as president in the interim.
   Wang stock rose 25 cents to close at $6.25 a share Wednesday on
the American Stock Exchange.
   Miller spent 12 years at Penn Central, during which the former
railroad company emerged from Bankruptcy Court reorganization as an
electronics and defense concern. He went to work for RCA in 1982. He
combined and restructured the consumer electronics operations of the
merged General Electric and RCA before their sale last year to
France's Thomson SA.
   John Welch, GE's chairman, released a statement Wednesday
praising Miller. ``Rick Miller is an outstanding leader. He has very
high standards.'' Welch said Miller has ``dealt successfully with
difficult situations in the past at Penn Central, RCA and GE.''
   In an interview in New York, Miller said he wants Wang staffers
to ``know where we're going, restore their dignity and give them
pride in the company's turnaround and accomplishments.''
   Miller also said the company likely would raise new money by
issuing more stock or debt, or both, and said several people were
interested in providing capital.
   There are no plans to sell Wang, he said.
   Following its loss of $424 million in the fiscal year ended June
30, Wang predicted more red ink in the first half of its current
fiscal year. It briefly suspended payments on some of its debt, but
resumed them this week after reaching a new agreement with its bank
lenders.
   Miller said his top priority is to reassure customers, some of
whom have been reluctant to buy from Wang because of concerns about
whether it will survive.
   A survey of 100 customers by Computerworld, a weekly newspaper,
found that 22 percent had been prompted to switch some buying to
other companies because of concerns about Wang's financial stability.
   That is a dangerously high percentage for a company that is
seeking to increase its revenue, said Jeff Goverman, an analyst at
SoundView Financial Group in Stamford, Conn.
   Analysts said before Miller's appointment that the new president
would have to have good relations with the founder, and Miller said
that is the case.
   Miller said, ``I could not be happier with the ease of
communication and the good relationship that has developed'' with An
Wang. ``There is mutual respect and the beginning of trust.''

<HEAD>Sources: Prosecutors May Allow Drexel to Pay Milken</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is reminding its
employees not to do business with its indicted former junk bond
chief, Michael Milken.
   Separately, sources said Wednesday that federal prosecutors are
reconsidering their agreement with Drexel that bars the investment
house from paying Milken his 1988 compensation of more than $100
million.
   Drexel this week issued a three-sentence memo to all workers
saying they cannot advise corporate clients if they also are being
advised by Milken, who has resigned from Drexel and set up a
financial consulting firm.
   ``While employees of Drexel Burnham may have purely social
contact with them, business matters that do or could involve Drexel
Burnham are not to be discussed,'' read the memo signed by Drexel
Chief Executive Frederick Joseph.
   Under a separate settlement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Drexel and its employees are barred from doing business
with Milken and his brother, Lowell, who also is charged by the
government.
   The Milkens were not party to the firm's SEC settlement, which is
to take effect after Drexel enters its criminal plea.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the memo was issued because
the firm is ``determined to live within the spirit of the (SEC)
agreement in the absence of its finalization.''
   Drexel was barred from paying Milken as part of its formal
settlement of criminal securities fraud charges.
   The withholding of pay has been controversial because Milken has
not been charged with committing any wrongdoing during 1988. Milken
has challenged the provision in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   Sources familiar with the case, who asked not to be identified,
said prosecutors have not made a final decision on whether to let
Drexel pay Milken his compensation, which court documents place at
well over $100 million.
   But they indicated a reversal may be made because legal experts
have criticized the provision as potentially unconstitutional and
the government may not want to start its case against Milken before
U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood on the wrong foot.
   They said ending the lengthy delay of Drexel's plea in the case
was not a factor in reconsidering the payment provision, but the
move could help to speed resolution of the drawn-out case.
   Spokesmen for Drexel and Milken declined to comment.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll said, ``When and if we make
a decision with regard to any matters in these cases, we will tell
them to Judge Wood before we tell them to anyone else.''
   Milken was charged in March in a 98-count indictment with
racketeering and fraud related to securities transactions. He
pleaded innocent and is scheduled to go to trial in March.
   A U.S. District Court hearing is scheduled for Sept. 6 on
Milken's arguments that the pay provision deprived him of
constitutional due process.
   The government has indicated Milken's compensation was ordered
withheld on grounds it was improper for Drexel to settle criminal
charges while it was paying millions to the employee allegedly
responsible for illegal activity.
   Drexel agreed in December to pay $650 million and plead guilty to
six felonies for violating securities laws, charges that stemmed
from the Ivan Boesky insider trading case. The plea has been held up
by a series of legal issues related to Milken, the last of which was
his challenge of the pay requirement.

   Malcolm Forbes says his children ultimately will
pay for his lavish birthday party last weekend in Morocco and that
he won't try to write it off his income taxes as a business expense.
   ``My children gave me the party. I'm picking up the tab. But in a
few years they'll be picking up the business and so what I have
spent on this birthday party in effect is coming out of their
inheritance,'' Forbes told reporters Wednesday.
   The business magazine publisher had come under criticism over
published reports quoting he and his son, Malcolm Forbes Jr., as
saying they considered some of the $2 million in party costs to be
business expenses. That led to speculation that Forbes was planning
to use part of the birthday tab as a tax deduction.
   Forbes called a news conference Wednesday to try to deflect the
criticism. He said that while a case could be made for using the
party costs as a business deduction, ``not a penny'' would be
written off.
   ``It was never planned to be a tax-deductible trip,'' Forbes
said. ``Where people got the notion ... I presume they got it
because three-quarters of the people there are major advertisers in
Forbes magazine.''
   Business expenses generally are at least partly tax deductible.
   Forbes' 70th birthday party in Tangier on the north coast of
Africa featured 600 belly dancers, 200 Berber horsemen, pigeon pie
served under elaborate tents and a guest list that included
Elizabeth Taylor, Henry Kissinger, Barbara Walters and such business
luminaries as Lee Iacocca, Rupert Murdoch and Henry Kravis.
   Guests were flown across the Atlantic on three jets, including a
chartered supersonic Concorde. The party's expense had been
estimated at $2 million to $3 million, although Forbes said
Wednesday the tab might not exceed $2 million because the government
of Morocco paid for part of the event, including guards.
   Forbes said the party had ``real business value to Forbes and its
customers'' and that as a result, Forbes magazine would be launching
an edition in Germany and may branch out into Italy, Spain and Japan.
   He likened it to the parties for advertisers that most magazines
give _ and write off.
   Rep. Fortney Stark, D-Calif., on Tuesday released a letter he
sent to Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg
saying he hoped the party was not deductible.
   ``The public's support of the tax system is destroyed by reports
of tax-deductible birthday bashes by belly-dancing billionaires,''
Stark wrote.
   Forbes called Stark's comments a form of election-year
``demagoguery.''
   The IRS has declined to comment on the party.
   Forbes conceded that an attempted writeoff might not go over well
with tax auditors.
   ``As I discussed with my boys, the idea of flying everybody in
super aircraft to a far outpost to celebrate a birthday would be
stretching things, in my opinion,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. and Warner Communications Inc.
announced that Warner shareholders would receive a package of
securities for their stock when the two media giants complete their
$14 billion merger.
   The companies said Wednesday that each of Warner's 86.8 million
shares still outstanding would be exchanged for securities valued at
$70, comprising two series of Time Warner preferred stock and common
stock of BHC Inc., a subsidiary of Chris-Craft Industries Inc.
   Time Inc. acquired approximately 100 million other Warner shares
at $70 a share in a cash tender offer that expired July 24. At that
point the company changed its name to Time Warner Inc.
   The package announced Wednesday _ known as the back end of the
merger _ means Time Warner's debt will not be further ballooned by
the cost of acquiring Warner. Shareholders and analysts had been
concerned about the amount of debt Time Warner would have following
the merger.
   Edward Adler, a Time Warner spokesman, said Time Warner would
incur $12 billion in debt in the acquisition, and with nearly $1.6
billion in already outstanding debt would have a total of $13.6
billion in liabilities.
   Fred Anschel, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the
fact that no cash was involved in the back end was a plus for Time
Warner.
   Time Warner stock gained $2.12{ to close at $141.75 a share in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   However, there appeared to be some confusion among Warner
investors about the breakdown of the preferred stock, and Warner
stock slipped $1.62{ to $65.37{ a share.
   The preferred stock can be converted to common stock in Time
Warner in the future, but the two series carry different terms for
their conversion and different dividends.
   Stock in BHC was included in the back end as a result of a
settlement between Warner and Chris-Craft. The settlement was part
of Warner's attempt to sever its ties with Chris-Craft, Warner's
largest shareholder.
   Analysts were still studying the details of the back end late
Wednesday. Ken Noble, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said that at
first glance the terms appeared good for current Warner shareholders.
   Time Warner said it expected paperwork and approvals for the back
end to be completed in the fourth quarter. At that time, the merger
will be completed and Warner Communications will cease to exist.
   Time Warner will be the world's largest communications concern.
   Time Inc. and Warner Communications announced plans to merge in a
stock-swap in March. On June 6, 2{ weeks before shareholders were to
vote on the deal, Paramount Communications Inc. announced a hostile
tender offer for Time.
   To preserve their merger, Time and Warner amended their agreement
to provide for Time's $14 billion tender offer for Warner.
   Paramount's $12 billion bid collapsed after the Delaware Supreme
Court upheld a lower court ruling that Paramount had no right to
interfere with Time's long-range plans.
   The ruling allowed the Time-Warner deal to go through and it also
was seen as upholding the rights of companies to arrange friendly
mergers without fear of having their plans upset by hostile suitors.

<HEAD>Goldsmith Announces Conditional Sale of Farmers Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir James Goldsmith says he would sell Farmers
Group Inc., a U.S. insurance company, to a French firm for $4.5
billion if he succeeds in his $21 billion bid for Farmers' parent
company, BAT Industries PLC.
   The French company, Axa Midi Assurances, also agreed to invest
$942 million in Hoylake Investments Ltd., Goldsmith's takeover
vehicle, the British investor said Wednesday.
   After Goldsmith announced his group's hostile 13.4 billion pound
offer last month, he said he would sell all of BAT's non-tobacco
interests, including Farmers, if he was successful.
   The agreement with Axa Midi ``clearly reaffirms our stated
intention that we do not wish to operate Farmers,'' Goldsmith said
in a statement.
   BAT, a British conglomerate that has rejected the Hoylake bid,
responded to Wednesday's announcement by telling shareholders they
would be deprived of Farmers' current value and future potential if
Hoylake were allowed to sell the insurance company ``on the cheap in
a forced sale.''
   Farmers is the third-largest home and auto insurer and the
seventh-biggest property and casualty insurer in the United States.
It operates mostly in the western part of the country.
   Any acquisition of Farmers, whether by Hoylake or Axa Midi, must
be approved by insurance regulators in the states where Farmers does
business. BAT acquired Farmers for $5.2 billion last year after an
eight-month takeover fight that included battles before the
insurance regulators of several states.
   There was heavy opposition to the takeover by BAT in part because
the conglomerate had no other insurance holdings. However, Axa Midi,
which comprises mutual and shareholder-owned insurance companies,
has U.S. holdings including Equity and Law, and has a full insurance
license in 27 states, including seven where Farmers operates.
   Axa Midi, one of the largest insurance groups in France and
Europe, had premium income of 42 billion French francs, or $6.36
billion in 1988.
   On Monday, BAT unveiled its defensive strategy against the
Goldsmith group, which also includes British merchant banker Jacob
Rothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer.
   The conglomerate, pointing to its past earnings record, told
shareholders they would profit more by holding on to their BAT stock
than by tendering it to Hoylake.
   BAT emphasized the strengths of its businesses, which besides
Farmers includes Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco, retailers Saks Fifth
Avenue and Marshall Field's, and paper maker Appleton Papers in
Wisconsin.
   Securities analysts said they expected BAT to deploy more active
defenses if and when Goldsmith raises his bid.
   A takeover of BAT would be the world's second-largest, after the
$24.53 billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. earlier this year.
   Goldsmith said Axa Midi's prospective investment would increase
the total cash committed to Hoylake to $2.36 billion.
   Axa Midi was to pay half of the $4.5 billion for Farmers in cash
at the close of the deal, and the rest in notes with maturities of
two to three years, Hoylake said.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Sharply, Tokyo Shares Decline</HEAD>

   The U.S. dollar rose sharply today against the
Japanese yen while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined.
   The dollar closed at 143.60 yen, up 1.25 yen from Wednesday's
close of 142.35 yen. After opening at 143.45 yen, it ranged between
143.37 and 143.83 yen. Over the previous three trading days, the
dollar had fallen 1.17 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 221.07 points Wednesday, dropped another
106.73 points, or 0.3 percent, closing at 34,786.55.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar gained after news
reports that a key official in the cabinet of new Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu would resign over a sex scandal.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Tokuo Yamashita then apologized for a
past extra-marital affair, but said only that he was ``seriously
considering'' whether to resign.
   Some dealers, meanwhile, said the decline in the yen stemmed more
from dealers selling West German marks to buy dollars than from any
inherent weakness in the yen.
   ``There was no yen-affecting news today,'' said a dealer at Daiwa
Bank.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader with New Japan Securities, said most
investors were waiting on the sidelines during much of the stock
exchange's morning session.
   ``In the afternoon, there was some buying by institutional
investors and index-related purchases by foreign traders, but
overall today's market was weak,'' he said.
   Nomura said no issues attracted particular buyer interest during
the day.
   Trading was thin, with only 380 million shares changing hands.

   A move by five grocery chains against a
synthetic hormone designed to boost cows' milk production may help
delay government approval for its commercial use, says an
anti-genetic engineering activist.
   Five food chains say they are not selling milk from cows treated
experimentally with the synthetic hormone, Jeremy Rifkin, head of
the Foundation on Economic Trends, said Wednesday.
   Bovine growth hormone, or BGH, is designed to boost cows'
production by as much as one-third.
   The decision by the food companies, as well as rising concerns in
dairy states, will ``put a lot of pressure'' on the Food and Drug
Administration to put off final approval of the hormone for general
use, Rifkin said.
   The FDA has allowed private companies to run limited on-farm
tests of BGH, and this milk has been reaching consumers, Rifkin said.
   ``I don't think it's a large amount,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``But if it is being sold over and over again in a small
test area to the same consumers, it could have an impact.''
   However, FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said the milk from test cows
was ``indistinguishable from ordinary milk'' and can be safely sold
because it has the same amount of BGH in it as ordinary milk. Grigg
said the agency expects to publish data in January supporting that
conclusion.
   Grigg said he could not say if or when BGH will be cleared for
general farm use because studies aimed at proving it is effective
and safe for both humans and cows have not been completed.
   Rifkin said exact locations of the tests, milk processors, the
number of cows and amounts of milk involved have not been disclosed.
   A number of companies are working on their own versions of BGH.
Those include Monsanto, Upjohn, American Cyanamid, and Eli Lilly.
   Rifkin said his foundation was joined by more than 40 other
public officials and national farm, consumer, animal welfare and
environmental groups in a petition asking the FDA to immediately
halt sales of milk and dairy products from cows treated with the
hormone.
   The groups also asked the agency to support long-term independent
research on the hormone's effects on humans and what kind of
economic impact can be expected among dairy armers, many of whom say
they will be forced out of business by lower milk prices if BGH is
approved.
   Rifkin said the food companies that agreed to ban BGH milk
included the giant Kroger chain, which is headquartered in
Cincinnati, Ohio, and Safeway, which has its corporate offices in
Oakland, Calif.
   Others include Supermarkets General, Woodbridge, N.J.; Stop and
Shop, Boston, Mass.; and Vons, El Monte, Calif.
   Paul Bernish, spokesman for Kroger, which operates in 32 states,
said the company has refused for the past year to buy dairy products
from test herds receiving BGH.
   ``We feel it is entirely appropriate for the government to be
testing this hormone,'' he said. ``But until the government finishes
its testing and gives an OK to use this hormone, we have told our
suppliers that we would not accept dairy products from those test
herds.''
   Safeway spokesman Brian Dowling said the company about three
years ago required milk suppliers to certify that their cows had not
been given the hormone.
   A spokeswoman for the Vons chain says their supermarkets have
never sold BGH milk because their supplier, the California Milk
Producers Association, doesn't offer the product.
   Meanwhile, ice cream maker Ben and Jerry's Homemade Inc. of
Waterbury, Vt., said it will label 6 million of its pints with a
message to ``Stop BGH, Save Family Farms.'' But Monsanto spokesman
Lawrence O'Neill said the company's campaign is ``unfair, it's
unfortunate, it's misinformed and discouraging.''
   The hormone is also known by its technical name, bovine
somatotropin, or BST. It is a protein produced naturally in the
pituitary gland of cattle. Among its metabolic functions is the
regulation of a cow's milk output, requiring the animal to eat more
as milk production is stepped up.
   The BGH controversy has raged in major dairy states like
Wisconsin, California, New York and Vermont. The Vermont state
legislature earlier this year called for a moratorium on commercial
use of BGH until further studies are made.
   At a Wisconsin legislative hearing in May, one witness described
BGH as ``the AK-47 of Wisconsin agriculture'' because of its
potential threat to the state's dairy industry, referring to the
automatic weapon favored by many terrorists.
   But James W. Lauderdale of the Upjohn Co., one of the developers,
told the hearing that if the hormone is approved by FDA it should be
given the same chance to perform as every other tool used by dairy
farmers.

   A bank for children thinks a credit card is
just what its kiddie customers want, but one opponent says teaching
a new generation how to borrow is the last thing this debt-plagued
country needs.
   ``We think it teaches absolutely the wrong message,'' said Loren
Dunton, president of the National Center for Financial Education, a
non-profit group that seeks to promote financial responsibility.
   ``Our message is to save now so you can buy later, and they're
promoting the philosophy of buy now and pay later.''
   The San Diego-based center plans to use its branches in 50 states
to ask parents and teachers to oppose a plan by the Young Americans
Bank to provide credit cards to children ages 12 and older.
   ``It offers the temptation to spend that even much older people
too often can't resist,'' Dunton said in an interview in San
Francisco Wednesday.
   But the Denver-based bank, whose customers are all young people,
said it is trying to teach the proper use of credit as part of
personal finance.
   ``Our feeling is that credit cards are really a way of life, and
a lot of us learn about credit in an undesireable way ... without
any supervision or control,'' bank president Linda Sanders said.
``Here that is done with control.''
   The bank, which already offers checking accounts to customers 12
and older, expects to issue the first cards by the end of this week.
It has received hundreds of applications from all over the country
since announcing earlier this month it would offer MasterCards to
young people through the United Bank of Denver.
   Applicants must have a parent or other adult co-sign to guarantee
payment, and they won't be able to exceed a credit limit of $100.
Otherwise, the cards will be like those issued to adults, with
monthly statements and interest accruing at an annual rate of 18.8
percent.
   Dunton said the low credit limit, co-signing requirement and even
instruction on responsible use are not sufficient safeguards.
   ``You can't expect a teen-ager to use it responsibly when
yuppies, who have been educated to the teeth, can't do it,'' he said.
   The center argues that excessive borrowing and consumption have
become deep-rooted and are hurting the nation's economy. Americans
saved only 3.2 percent of their income in 1987, for example, while
Japanese saved an average of 16.5 percent.
   The center advocates greater savings, a balanced budget amendment
to the Constitution, and a requirement that rehabilitative education
be made part of bankruptcy procedures. Dunton says there is no shame
or embarrassment attached to bankruptcy filings these days, and he
considers that a bad sign.
   Rather than giving youngsters credit cards, Dunton advocates
teaching all elementary school students about money and high school
seniors about personal finance, including credit.
   ``What they need is a savings account before a credit card. They
should put off getting a credit card until they absolutely need it
for identification,'' he said.
   Sanders said she was sympathetic to Dunton's concerns. Teaching
children about financial responsibility was one of the reasons the
bank was founded two years ago, she said.
   Young Americans, state-chartered and federally insured, has $5.9
million in deposits from more than 9,300 customers. They range in
age from newborns to 22, with the bulk 8 to 14, Sanders said.
   The bank has about 1,100 checking accounts held by customers with
an average age of 15. It also has about 1,500 borrowers with a total
of $950,000 outstanding, about a third of which is for student loans.
   Customers come from across the nation, although the majority live
in Colorado.
   The bank decided to offer credit cards at the request of
customers polled by its advisory board of young people, Sanders said.
   The bank has not had any problems with overdrawn accounts or loan
defaults, Sanders said. She expressed confidence that young
customers will use the cards responsibly.
   ``I have been in banking for 20 years and have never dealt with a
customer base with more integrity,'' she said.

   Car sales by the eight major U.S.-based automakers
rose 5.4 percent in mid-August while light truck sales fell 2.1
percent, indicating that some buyers may be rushing to showrooms to
beat 1990 price increases.
   Overall, car and truck sales continued running behind last year's
pace by 3.3 percent, the companies said in sales reports Wednesday.
   ``The two big leading (economic) indicators, that being
unemployment and interest rates, don't seem to have softened,'' said
analyst Paul Kleinaitis of Duff &amp; Phelps of Chicago.
   ``So given that, and given the fact that price increases are due
for the Big Three, maybe buyers were accelerated into purchasing now
rather than in the new model year,'' he said.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have
announced average car price increases of 3.4 percent, 4.8 percent
and 5 percent, respectively.
   ``I think the uptick we had in July (sales) was partly an
increase in consumer awareness of a price increase,'' said analyst
Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. in New York City.
   ``But the incentives got richer and the combinations make some
deals too good to resist for some people,'' she said. ``Right now,
we're borrowing sales from the fourth quarter.''
   On Wednesday, the automakers reported combined car and truck
sales averaging 34,290 a day during the Aug. 11-20 period this year,
up 2.6 percent from a rate of 33,409 during the same time last year.
   ``The numbers look good to me, compared to what we've been
conditioned to expect,'' Kleinaitis said.
   Through last Sunday, companies said, 1989 vehicle sales averaged
37,908 a day, down 3.3 percent from the 39,222 vehicle-a-day rate
during the same period last year.
   GM said its mid-August car sales were off 0.7 percent compared
with last year and for the year to date, its car sales were down 8.3
percent. GM's truck sales were up 4.3 percent in mid-August and up
1.9 percent for the year to date.
   Ford said its car sales were up 2.8 percent during the second
10-day period of August but were down 1.4 percent for the year.
Ford's light truck sales were down 10.7 percent in mid-August and
down 3 percent for the year to date.
   Chrysler said its car sales during the period were up 6 percent
from last year and down 13.3 percent for the year. The company's
light truck sales fell 1.2 percent for the period and 0.2 percent
for the year.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for the second period of August 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals. There
were eight selling days in the period this year and nine selling
days last year.
   For the first two sales periods of the month, there were 17
selling days this year and 18 selling days last year, and for the
year so far, 195 selling days this year and 197 selling days last
year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and Chrysler
names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and trucks are
reported at the end of each month.

   A distinct identity for Chevrolet's Geo line of
small vehicles still hasn't been developed, nearly a year after the
first of the cars were introduced, a company executive says.
   Chevrolet General Manager Jim Perkins said Wednesday the GM
division is about halfway through its process of developing its Geo
franchise.
   The company is walking a narrow path between selling and
servicing the three Geo cars and one truck at Chevrolet dealers and
fostering a separate image for the nameplate.
   Geo cars were introduced in January. Since then, one model, the
Spectrum, has been dropped and two, the Metro and Storm, have been
added.
   Separate Geo signs are going up at dealerships and some Chevrolet
dealers are taking out space in commercial telephone books in the
G's to encourage the brand distinction.
   Also, Chevrolet's well-known ``Heartbeat of America'' advertising
theme, going into its fourth year, will not be used in Geo ads.
Instead, those ads feature the theme, ``Getting to know Geo,'' to
the tune of ``Getting to Know You,'' from the play ``The King and
I.''
   ``The Geo imagery is going to become more focused than it has
been in the past,'' Perkins said.
   Perkins, speaking during the introduction of the Chevrolet lineup
for 1990, also said GM is ready to give Chevrolet dealers a hand in
marketing the Geo and will boost the potential dealer profit margin
on Geo cars and trucks.
   GM has been criticized for failing to give consumers a clear
picture of its new line of cars. For the coming model year, there
will be three Geo cars _ the Storm, Prizm and Metro and one
sport-utility vehicle _ the Tracker.
   The Metro is made by Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd. in Japan; the Tracker
is made in Canada by the GM-Suzuki joint venture Canadian-American
Manufacturing Inc.; the Prizm is made in Fremont, Calif., at the
GM-Toyota joint venture New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.; and the
Storm is made in Fujisawa, Japan, by Isuzu Motors Ltd.
   Eighty-four percent of the 4,800 Chevrolet dealers have agreed to
sell Geos. GM denied reports earlier this year that some dealers
were pressured into taking on Geo in return for getting a crack at
selling the new Corvette ZR-1, production of which begins later this
month in Bowling Green, Ky.
   Perkins said the ZR-1, with a 370-horsepower engine that can push
the car from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds, will sell for $58,995.
About 3,000 of the cars will be available in the United States
during the 1990 model year, mainly because of restraints by the
engine maker, Mercury Marine.
   An undetermined number of ZR-1 Corvettes will be sold in Europe,
Perkins said.
   Separately Wednesday, Ford Motor Co. rolled the first 1990
Lincoln Town Car off the assembly line in Wixom, Mich., with a
ceremony complete with a cake the shape of a 1989 Town Car. The new
version, which will be introduced formally Oct. 5, is a longer,
slightly rounded version of the 1989 model.

Inn hotel system to Bass PLC for $2.23 billion and create a
subsidiary to operate its gaming operations and three newer hotel
brands. Holiday shares jumped 10 to 87.
   In addition, brokers noted a favorable response to automakers'

   Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts say a survey this week of the Midwest corn crop has
added several million bushels to the Agriculture Department's
estimated crop yield. That news is pushing corn prices lower.
   Soybean prices were pushed lower by rains and a National Weather
Service 6- to 10-day forecast that calls for more precipitation.
Soybean prices are also being pressured by a lack of demand.

   Holiday Corp. said today it will sell its
Holiday Inn hotel system to Bass PLC for $2.23 billion and create a
subsidiary to operate the company's gaming operations and three
newer hotel brands.
   Holiday Chairman Michael Rose said the company decided to sell
the Holiday Inn system because ``it became increasingly clear to us
that a separation of Holiday Inns from Holiday Corp.'s other brands
was the most effective positioning of the brands in the 1990s and
beyond.''
   Holiday's other hotels include Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn and
Homewood Suites. Rose said these chains ``had reached levels of
development that will make them increasingly competitive with
Holiday Inns.''
   Bass, a British brewer and hotel operators, will acquire 55 owned
or leased properties, as well as franchise agreements, joint venture
agreements and management contracts that cover about 1,400 Holiday
Inn hotels in North America.
   The agreement calls for Bass to merge a new U.S. subsidiary with
Holiday, converting each share of Holiday stock into about .25 share
of Bass stock. Holiday will retire or assume about $2.1 billion in
debt.
   Holiday stock shot up $7.25 to $84.25 a share at midday on the
New York Stock Exchange today. On Wednesday, the company's stock
soared $7.87{ in anticipation of today's announcement.
   Analysts were pleased with the move. Marvin Roffman, a market
analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. of Philadelphia, said
Holiday Corp. got a top price for the Holiday Inn chain.
   The deal also ``clearly focuses (Holiday Corp.) in the
high-growth segments of the hotel business and makes it much more of
a gaming company,'' Roffman said.
   Last year, Bass bought the rights to franchise Holiday Inn hotels
outside North America. As the result of that and other purchases it
already owns 14 Holiday Inn hotels in the southeast United States
and is a major franchisee in Canada.
   Bass, with annual sales approaching $6 billion, has more than
7,300 pubs and other food and drink outlets in the United Kingdom.
It brews Bass, Carling Black Label and other beers and has annual
sales approaching $6 billion.
   Holiday has sold off a number of assets in recent years as part
of a recapitalization plan. In February, Holiday Corp. five hotels
to a limited partnership comprising overseas investors or their U.S.
subsidiaries.
   In May, Holiday formed a partnership with a Japanese company to
develop hotels in the United States.
   The spun-off company to operate the three newer hotel chains and
Holiday's Harrah's casinos in Nevada and New Jersey will be run by
Holiday's present senior management group in Memphis and will be
named at a later date.
   ``The spin-off company, formed around Harrah's and these rapidly
growing brands, will be given a new name that reflects the dynamism,
prospective growth and commitment to excellence that will
characterize it,'' Rose said.
   The transactions announced today must be approved by stockholders
from both companies, as well as Nevada and New Jersey gaming
officials.

<BYLINE>Britain's Biggest Brewer To Operate World's Largest Hotel Chain
^By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bass PLC's proposed $2.23 billion acquisition of
the Holiday Inn hotel system from Holiday Corp. would make Britain's
biggest brewer the operator of the world's largest hotel chain.
   The deal, which would give Bass control of some 1,600 Holiday
Inns, marks an attempt by the London-based company to diversify away
from brewing and to expand geographically, analysts said Thursday.
   Bass has been criticized in recent years for having its profits
too heavily concentrated in beer and pubs in Britain. Analysts say
the company's Bass, Carling Black Label and Tennent's beers and the
7,000 pubs it owns in Britain represent about 68 percent of its
operating profits.
   Rupert Symington, an analyst with Nomura Securities in London,
noted that ``Bass is almost completely a brewery and pub company. It
has recognized a need to diversify out of its core business of beer
and pubs.''
   With the Holiday Inn purchase, Symington said hotels will
represent 25 percent of Bass's operating profits, compared with 10
percent currently.
   While the acquisition initially might depress Bass' stock price,
analysts called it a good strategic move for long-term development.
   ``It's very difficult when you're No. 1 of the British market
with 22 percent of the market, to grow and get a bigger market
share,'' said one analyst who asked not to be identified.
   Under terms of the deal, Bass will acquire 55 owned or leased
properties, as well as franchise agreements, joint venture
agreements and management contracts that cover about 1,400 Holiday
Inn hotels in North America.
   Last year, Bass bought the rights to franchise Holiday Inn hotels
outside North America, covering about 200 of them.
   Bass said the acquisition gives it ``considerable opportunity for
profit growth'' by allowing it to capitalize on its vast expertise
in ownership and management of international hotels.
   So far the company's diversification into hotels has been
successful. Symington noted that Bass's 66 Crest hotels in Britain
and its European Holiday Inns are performing well.
   Last March, Bass bought the Commonwealth Hospitality Ltd. hotel
chain in Canada from Scotts Hospitality Inc. of Toronto for $222
million, giving it an additional 38 hotels.
   Bass Chairman Ian Prosser said the acquisition ``represents a
substantial move forward in the Bass strategy of becoming
international in each of its core businesses.''
   But one analyst noted that Bass is ``a very U.K.-based company.
Even after this acquisition, three-fourths of its profit comes from
the U.K.''
   Over the years Bass also has marketed soft drinks under Britvic
and other brand names, and operated bingo and snooker halls, betting
shops and a travel agency with mixed results, Symington said.
   On the London Stock Exchange, Bass rose 8 cents to close at
$17.97 a share.
   Bass, which employs 85,000 people, reported profits of $504
million, or $1.37 a share, on revenue of $5.8 billion in the year
ended September 1988.

<HEAD>Claimants Who Challenged Robins Plan to Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Implementation of A.H. Robins Co.'s
reorganization plan will be delayed until at least November while
claimants who challenged the plan appeal its approval to the U.S.
Supreme Court, claimants said Thursday.
   ``We're going to the Supreme Court,'' said Rosemary
Menard-Sanford, one of thousands of women who claimed they were
injured by the Dalkon Shield birth-control device marketed by the
company in the early 1970s.
   More than 94 percent of the claimants voted in favor of the
reorganization plan, confirmed by U.S. District Judge Robert R.
Merhige Jr. But about 900 women had rejected the plan, which was
upheld in June by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals along with a
related class-action suit against Aetna Casualty and Surety Co.
   Had no further appeals been sought, the trust would have been
funded and the plan consummated Sept. 28, Robins spokesman Roscoe
Puckett said Thursday.
   ``Robins recognizes that it is the appellants' right to seek
further review of the plan by the Supreme Court,'' Puckett said.
``However, the company believes that the overwhelming majority of
Dalkon Shield claimants who voted to accept the plan will share its
deep disappointment and frustration that there will be further
indeterminant delays in implementation of the plan.
   ``The appellants' decision, which will continue to cost claimants
roughly half a million dollars daily in lost interest income, is
particularly disappointing in light of the fact that five judges
already have considered the reorganization plan and judged it
proper.''
   Robins, a large pharmaceutical company based in Richmond, sought
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in August
1985.
   Included in the reorganization plan are a $2.3 billion fund to
compensate claimants injured by the Dalkon Shield; $350 million in
insurance from Aetna, the products liability insurer for the device;
and the absorption of Robins by American Home Products Corp. of New
York in an exchange of stock worth $700 million to Robins
shareholders.
   Suits against Robins officers and directors and the Richmond law
firm that supervised most of the Dalkon Shield litigation before the
bankruptcy action are barred.
   In the petition to be filed Sept. 14, three women represented by
Washington lawyer Alan B. Morrison said they have decided not to
pursue their contention that the approval of the plan was flawed.
   Instead, the women said, they will focus on provisions of the
plan that bar suits against other defendants, which would allow
Robins and American Home Products to complete their merger if they
wish.
   ``We believe that the amount of money set aside in the Dalkon
Shield Claimants' Trust established by the Robins' reorganization
plan is inadequate, as it will not provide full compensation for
Dalkon Shield victims, particularly those with clearly meritorious
claims and serious injuries,'' said Denver lawyer Douglas E. Bragg,
who represents about 100 claimants.
   The amount needed to resolve the claims is closer to $4.2 billion
to $7 billion, Bragg said.
   He said that since the trust might not have enough money to
resolve all claims, claimants must be free to pursue Aetna, Robins
officers and directors and the company's attorneys, who he said are
liable because they conspired with Robins to cover up the dangers of
the Dalkon Shield.
   The companies last month rejected a merger that would have
allowed suits against other defendants. The companies have said
suits against the other potential defendants would result in claims
for indemnity against the trust. Defending those claims would
distract the trustees and reduce the amount of money available to
pay claims, the companies contend.
   About 118,000 claims still are pending and would be resolved
through procedures to be developed by trustees of the claimants'
trust.
   E. Claiborne Robins, patriarch of the pharmaceutical company, and
his son, Robins President E. Claiborne Robins Jr., have agreed to
pay $5 million each to the trust fund, which also will get $75
million from Aetna.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed
in quiet trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Overnight rains in the Midwest and the National Weather Service's
6- to 10-day forecast, which calls for additional precipitation in
major crop states, weighed on the market.
   Also putting a brake on corn prices were reports that a survey of
the Iowa corn crop placed the per-acre yield at higher levels than
predicted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said Jerry Gidel,
an analyst with LIT America Inc. in Chicago.
   There had been reports that a lack of rain earlier this month
caused a decline in the quality of crops in parts of the Midwest,
including Iowa.
   Soybean prices were pressured by the weather forecasts and lack
of demand.
   Wheat prices were mixed at the start of trading, with support
coming from anticipated orders from Egypt and other nations. The
failure of the orders to materialize during trading did not prevent
wheat prices from finishing higher.
   At the close of trading, wheat was a { cent to 2} cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $3.93} a bushel; corn
was 1} cents to 3 cents lower with September at $2.34 a bushel; oats

   ``People realize there's not going to be a recession,'' said

<HEAD>Money Funds Rise to New Record of $343.22 Billion</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Assets of the nation's 463 money market mutual
funds rose by $2.68 billion in the latest week to hit a new record
of $343.22 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday marked the
eighth straight week for a new all-time high in fund assets, the
Washington-based mutual trade group reported.
   The previous record set the week ended Aug. 16 totaled $340.54
billion, revised slightly upward from the $340.51 billion originally
reported by the institute.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 227 general purpose funds rose $1.04 billion to $109.78
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $1.59 billion to
$147.85 billion, and assets of 141 institutional funds rose by $51.0
million to $85.58 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.31 percent from 8.33 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.38 percent from 8.45 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 40
days, unchanged from a week earlier, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts fell to 6.45 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.46 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was 5.11 percent, unchanged from the previous week.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.25
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 8.26 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.25
percent; 8.19 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.17 percent; and 8.18
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.17 percent.

   The stock market surged ahead with renewed force
Thursday, breaking a record high for the Dow Jones industrial
average that had stood for two years.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips jumped 56.53 points to
2,734.64, surpassing its closing reading of 2,722.42 on Aug. 25,
1987.
   The gain was the second biggest this year for the average, topped
only by a 56.82-point advance on May 12.
   With Thursday's session, the Dow became the last of the widely
recognized market indicators to recover all the ground it lost in
the crash of 1987. Other, broader market measures started hitting
new peaks several weeks ago.
   Analysts said the market got a lift from a downturn in interest
rates that began Wednesday. Rates declined slightly in erratic
trading Thursday.
   Brokers also said buying was encouraged by a continuing flow of
developments and rumors on the mergers and acquisitions front.
   In the latest deal, Holiday Corp. said it would sell its Holiday
Inn hotel system to Bass PLC for $2.23 billion and create a
subsidiary to operate its gaming operations and three newer hotel
brands. Holiday shares climbed 6 to 83.
   In addition, big-name stocks got several boosts from waves of
buying by professional traders engaged in computer-program
strategies involving stock index options and futures.
   ``People realize there's not going to be a recession,'' said
Hildegarde Zagorski at Prudential-Bache Securities. ``And the
speculative fever created by the takeovers is certainly contributing
to the market's strength.''
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,180 up, 359 down and 443 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 225.52 million
shares, up from 159.64 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 272.30 million shares.
   Point-plus gainers among the blue chips included General Motors,
up 2\ at 46}; International Business Machines, up 2 at 116; American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 1{ at 40[; General Electric, up 1[ at 58[,
and Procter &amp; Gamble, up 4{ at 131.
   Rumors and conjecture about possible takeovers or other deals
benefited such diverse stocks as K mart, up 2\ at 43}; Maytag, up 1{
at 26{, and Phillips Petroleum, up 2~ at 28[.
   Among the day's few losers, La-Z-Boy Chair fell 1[ to 20}. The
company reported lower quarterly earnings.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $57.18 billion, or 1.69
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
3.45 to 195.29.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 8.07 to 402.71, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 6.82 at 351.52.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market picked
up 4.20 to 465.88. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 381.45, up 3.75.

<HEAD>Dow Industrial Average Sets New Record High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones industrial average surged 56.53
points a new closing high Thursday, shattering the record set almost
exactly two years earlier and symbolically marking a recovery from
the Black Monday crash.
   The index of 30 blue chip industrial stocks _ which to many
people symbolizes the stock market _ finished at 2,734.64, topping
the previous record close of 2,722.42 of Aug. 25, 1987.
   With Thursday's session, the Dow became the last of the widely
recognized market indicators to recover all the ground it lost in
the crash of 1987 that culminated with a record 508 point loss on
Oct. 19.
   Wall Street has been rallying in recent months largely due to a
decline in interest rates, which investors see as an encouraging
sign that the Federal Reserve is controlling inflation without
causing an economic recession.
   Widespread speculation in takeover stocks also has helped boost
prices.
   The Dow industrials actually had flirted with a new high in
several sessions earlier this month before pulling back each time at
the close.
   ``It was sort of a bugaboo for a lot of people,'' said Robert
Seijas, a market maker at the New York Stock Exchange. ``Just
getting through it removes a lot of the fear.''
   On Thursday, interest rates declined slightly in erratic trading
while several other takeover developments emerged, including Holiday
Corp.'s agreement to sell its Holiday Inn hotel chain to Bass PLC
for $2.23 billion.
   Big-name stocks also got a boost at midday from a wave of buying
by professional traders engaged in computerized strategies involving
stock index options and futures.

<HEAD>Australia's Domestic Airline Industry Shut Down By Pilots' Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australia's domestic airline industry
shut down Thursday as carriers began dismissing pilots for not
working to contract and all 1,600 pilots retaliated by resigning en
masse.
   The pilots began striking last Friday over a demand for a 30
percent wage increase which the labor government has called
unacceptable because of a wages and incomes policy limiting
increases to 3 percent.
   Pilots refused to work beyond the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
   Most international airlines, meanwhile, agreed to provide seats
for domestic passengers for the Australian segments of international
flights.
   At least eight international carriers, including Continental
Airlines of the United States, have agreed to carry domestic
passengers on the domestic segments of their routes. The others are
Thai International, Singapore Airlines, Olympic Airways of Greece,
Garuda of Indonesia, Malaysian Airways, Cathay Pacific of Hong Kong
and British Airways.
   The Australian government also was considering providing
emergency services with the help of the Air Force. An Air Force
Boeing 747 was expected to take to the air on Friday.
   Pilots for Qantas Airways, Australia's international flag
carrier, refused to act as strike-breakers and said they would not
cooperate except to pick up domestic passengers for compassionate
reasons.
   The two domestic airlines, Australian Airlines and Ansett, began
issuing writs against individual pilots seeking unspecified damages
to cover lost profits.
   The pilots are seeking a wage hike that would boost an average
annual salary to 100,000 U.S. dollars.
   Tourism officials said the dispute could cost the country
millions of dollars in lost revenue.

<HEAD>Money Supply Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Aug. 14, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,133.4 billion from $3,132.3 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,012.0 billion from $4,010.5 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $774.6 billion from $778.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 2.8 percent,
which is below the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The
annual growth rate in M3 is 4.1 percent, which is within the Fed's
target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,101.8 billion, a 3.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,983.4 billion, up 3.4 percent, while M1 fell
4.7 percent to an average of $774.3 billion.
   In another report, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported
that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $291.7 billion in the two-week period ended Aug.
23, up from $289.5 billion two weeks earlier.

   The dollar finished mostly higher in quiet
worldwide trading Thursday.
   Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery lost $1.30 to close at $364.50 a troy
ounce. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold
of $362.40 an ounce, down from $364.15 late Wednesday.
   Traders said the dollar held within a very narrow range
throughout the day and volume was very thin.
   After a brief selloff on unconfirmed rumors that the Federal
Reserve and the Bank of Japan might be moving to lower interest
rates, the dollar staged a ``minor comeback,'' said Curtis Perkins,
a trader at Chemical New York Capital Markets Group.
   The underlying sentiment toward the U.S. currency remains fairly
bullish, traders said. ``It's been a very slow move up, slow and
steady with corrections all the way, but we're always solidifying
the move up,'' noted Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Flanagan said the West German Bundesbank's announcement that it
was not altering its monetary policy helped support the dollar.
Several other European central banks followed by saying they also
planned no immediate changes in interest rates.
   Earlier in the week traders began bracing themselves for a hike
in European interest rates, which would pressure the dollar by
making the returns on foreign investments more attractive.
   In the absence of any meaningful news, traders are looking to
next week's release of U.S. economic indicators to influence the
market.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose a sharp 1.25 Japanese yen to close at 143.60 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at 143.29 yen. In New York, the
dollar closed at 143.21 yen, up from 143.20 yen late Wednesday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5698 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5700 late Wednesday. In
New York, one pound cost $1.5720, more expensive than Wednesday's
$1.5715.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, included: 1.9565 West German marks, up from 1.9525;
1.6870 Swiss francs, up from 1.6838; 6.5955 French francs, up from
6.5875; 1,402.50 Italian lire, up from 1,398.88, and 1.1748 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1769.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.9585 West German marks, up from 1.9555; 1.6880 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6870; 6.6060 French francs, up from 6.5965; 2.2095
Dutch guilders, up from 2.2000; 1,406.75 Italian lire, up from
1,399.50, and 1.1765 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1727.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $362.75 a troy ounce,
down from late Wednesday's $364.25. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold
closed at a bid $362.00, down from $363.85 late Wednesday. Earlier
in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.48 to close at a bid $364.75.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver for current
delivery rose to $5.166 a troy ounce from $5.164 on Wednesay. In
London, the metal traded at a late bid price of $5.17 a troy ounce,
down from $5.19.

<HEAD>British Company to Buy Holiday Inns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WOODY BAIRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holiday Corp. announced the end of its
reign as ``America's Innkeeper'' Thursday with an agreement to sell
the Holiday Inn chain to Britain's brewing giant Bass PLC for $2.23
billion.
   Holiday Corp. said it would form a new subsidiary to run its
profitable casino business and newer hotel brands, Embassy Suites,
Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites.
   The announcement was welcomed by investors in the company, well
known for the hundreds of Holiday Inns that dot the nation's
highways and cities. There had been rampant speculation that Holiday
Corp. would be vulnerable to an unwanted takeover without some sort
of major restructuring.
   Holiday Corp. stock surged $6 a share to $83 in heavy New York
Stock Exchange trading on the news.
   ``It clearly focuses (Holiday Corp.) in the high-growth segments
of the hotel business and makes it a more clearly focused company,''
said Marvin Roffman, a market analyst with Janney Montogmery Scott
Inc. of Philadelphia.
   The announcement also marked the end of Holiday Corp.'s leading
position as owner of the dominant hotel chain in the country, a
status that led the company to describe itself as ``America's
Innkeeper.''
   Michael D. Rose, Holiday Corp.'s chief executive officer, said
the company's newer hotel brands have grown to the point they
compete with Holiday Inn in the marketplace and for attention within
the corporation.
   ``It became increasingly clear to us that a separation of Holiday
Inns from Holiday Corp.'s other brands was the most effective
positioning of the brands in the 1990s and beyond,'' Rose said in a
statement.
   The sale, which requires shareholder approval, calls for Holiday
Corp.'s stockholders to draw one-quarter share of Bass stock for
each Holiday Corp. share, with a value calculated at $125 million.
Bass also will assume about $2.1 billion in outstanding Holiday
debt, making the deal worth $2.3 billion.
   In addition, the spun-off company will pay a special $35-a-share
cash dividend to Holiday Corp. shareholders, worth nearly $935
million. Holiday Corp. has 26.7 million shares outstanding.
   The sale to Bass will allow Holiday Corp. to retire $2.1 billion
in outstanding debt, much of which stems from the company's
financial recapitalization in 1987, Holiday spokesman Ralph Berry
said.
   ``As a result of that, the new company when it's spun off will be
virtually debt free. It will then borrow or finance new borrowing to
pay the dividend,'' he said.
   In addition to approval from shareholders of both companies, the
agreement must also be sanctioned by Nevada and New Jersey gaming
officials.
   With the sale, Bass will acquire 55 owned or leased properties as
well as franchise agreements, joint venture agreements and
management contracts covering 1,400 Holiday Inn hotels in North
America.
   Last year, Bass bought the rights to franchise Holiday Inn hotels
outside North America. As the result of that and other purchases it
already owns 14 Holiday Inn hotels in the southeast United States
and is a major franchisee in Canada.
   Bass has more than 7,300 pubs and other food and drink outlets in
the United Kingdom. The company also brews Bass, Carling Black Label
and other beers and has annual sales approaching $6 billion.
   Holiday has sold off numerous assets in recent years as the
company directed its energies toward property management rather than
ownership. The company sold 127 hotels between 1985 and last year,
Berry said.
   ``That was merely selling property but retaining management of
those properties, where this is actually a transaction that will
remove us from the Holiday Inns business,'' he said.
   Bass is expected to keep Holiday Inn's North American
headquarters in Memphis, Berry said, and Holiday Corp. employees now
working for Holiday Inn will become Bass employees.
   Roffman said Holiday Corp. is wise to concentrate on its newer
hotel brands and casino-hotel company, Harrah's.
   ``Harrah's is one of the leaders in the gaming industry with
highly profitable properties,'' Roffman said. ``The company is
poised for substantial growth in their new form and with a much
better balance sheet.''

<HEAD>Coffee Prices Plunge on Brazilian Announcement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices fell sharply Thursday on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange on news that Brazil will not re-introduce its
coffee retention program.
   On other markets, copper was up sharply, sugar prices plunged,
grain and sopybean futures were mostly lower, livestock and pork
futures were down and precious metals were mixed.
   Coffee prices settled 4.22 cents to 4.75 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at 79 cents a pound.
   Esther Eskenasy, an analyst for Cargill Investors Services in New
York, described the selloff of coffee futures, the first in five
sessions, as panic selling.
   ``The market dropped like a stone from the opening, and didn't
get support until it reached 80 cents,'' she said.
   Ms. Eskenasy attributed the decline to an announcement late
Wednesday by Brazilian Coffee Institute President Jorio Dauster that
the institute has no plans to begin storing three 60-kilogram bags
of coffee for every bag exported.
   Dauster said the policy was dropped when the International Coffee
Organization abolished export quotas in July.
   The organization will meet again on Sept. 25 when it is expected
to again address export quotas. Ms. Exkenasy said some countries are
pressing for quotas because of hurting economies.
   Copper futures continued their upward spiral as production
problems continue to influence the market.
   ``Every producing company has some kind of problem,'' said Fred
Demler, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York,
adding that the problems will not be resolved soon.
   In addition to a paralyzing strike in Peru, a strike continues at
the Highland Valley mines in British Columbia, Canada. Mexico's
Cananea mine is expected to be closed as long as three months
following a declaration of bankruptcy. And the Bougainville mine in
Papua, New Guinea remains closed because of terrorist activities by
landowners.
   ``Demand in the United States and Japan remains strong at a time
of declining stocks, at a time of year when they usually increase
because of slack demand,'' Demler said.
   Copper prices were 2.60 cents to 2.90 cents higher with August at
$1.305 a pound.
   An expected rise in European sugar production sent sugar futures
plummeting on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
   A report prepared by a West German statistician indicates that
European sugar production will increase by more than 1 million
metric tons from 30.9 million metric tons in 1988-1989.
   The report also predicted the Soviet Union will reduce its sugar
imports.
   Sugar settled .20 cent to .30 cent lower with October at 13.90
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in quiet trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Overnight rains in the Midwest and the National Weather Service's
6- to 10-day forecast, which calls for additional precipitation in
major crop states, weighed on the market.
   Also putting a brake on corn prices were reports that a survey of
the Iowa corn crop placed the per-acre yield at higher levels than
predicted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said Jerry Gidel,
an analyst with LIT America Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat prices were mixed at the start of trading, with support
coming from anticipated orders from Egypt and other nations.
   Wheat was \ cent to 3 cents higher with the contract for delivery
in September at $3.93} a bushel; corn was 1} cents to 3 cents lower
with September at $2.34\ a bushel; oats were a { cent to 1{ cents
lower with September at $1.38 a bushel; soybeans were a 2\ cents
lower to a \ cent higher with September at $5.95} a bushel.
   Oil futures were mostly lower in quiet trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in the wake of a Department of Energy report of
an 8.9 million barrel buildup of crude oil stocks.
   West Texas Intermediate crude was 10 cents to 20 cents lower with
October at $18.61 a barrel; heating oil was .08 cent to .29 cent
lower with September at 51.70 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.01 cent to .29 cent lower with September at 54.15 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals prices were lower on New York's Commodities
Exchange on slack interest due to a stronger-than-expected economy.
   Gold settled $1.20 to $1.30 lower with August at $364.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with August at $5.175 a
troy ounce.
   Pork futures were slightly higher on gains in spot-market prices,
and livestock futures were lower due to concerns over plentiful
supplies in light trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent to .38 cent lower with September at
73.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .27 cent lower
with August at 84.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent lower to
.25 cent higher with October at 41.62 cents a pound; pork bellies
were .02 cent lower to 1.80 cents higher with August at 28.97 cents
a pound.

moderate trading Thursday, pressured by new government data that
showed a bigger surplus of oil than earlier reported.
   The Department of Energy, in its weekly inventory report, said
supplies of crude oil and heating oil in storage were several
million barrels higher than those reported by the American Petroleum
Institute on Tuesday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell 19
cents to finish at $18.61 a barrel, after an 11-cent gain in
Wednesday's session.
   Refined products traded on the exchange ended mixed, with the
September and October gasoline contracts closing higher. The
September contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.22 cent to finish at
54.15 cents a gallon and the October contract advanced 0.3 cent to
51.98 cents a gallon. Contracts for later delivery declined.
   Heating oil for September delivery fell 0.21 cent to settle at
51.70 cents a gallon and prices of other contract months also sank.
   Energy brokers said buying by major refiners, who had not been
heavy traders lately, boosted the two front-month gasoline
contracts. The majors were buying the last of the low-vapor summer
gasoline mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency, brokers
said.
   The EPA required refiners to make gasoline with a lower
evaporation tendency during the summer months in an effort to reduce
auto emissions. The restrictions expire on Sept. 15.
   Futures prices reacted early to the DOE statistics, analysts said.
   ``The report started things off on a bad note,'' said Evan Baron,
senior account executive with Elders Futures Inc.
   The report for the week ended Aug. 18 showed that crude supplies
rose 8.9 million barrels to 340.6 million barrels, compared with a
4.4 million-barrel rise to 335.2 million reported by the API.
Heating oil inventories increased to 118 million barrels, a 1.5
million-barrel rise, according to the DOE statistics, compared with
a 1.1 million-barrel-rise to 115.6 million shown in the API report.
   Traders said the DOE report could be a catalyst for weaker prices
over the next few days. Crude prices have zigzagged but remained
relatively strong despite reports that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries is producing more oil than the global market can
absorb.

   History repeated itself and then some Thursday on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average had a record
close just one day short of the second anniversary of its previous
all-time high.
   The record appeared to mark Wall Street's complete recovery from
the nightmare of Black Monday _ Oct. 19, 1987 _ when the average
fell a record 508 points in a single session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks set its record in
suitably dramatic fashion, rocketing 56.53 points higher in the
second biggest gain of the year.
   Wall Street's best-known average closed at 2,734.64, topping the
record of 2,722.42 set on Aug. 25, 1987.
   As often happens, the market made one of its biggest moves on a
day when nothing in particular happened in the financial world
outside the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``The stock market just came out of nowhere. It's a real
surprise,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist of Nikko Securities
Co. International Inc., the New York arm of a Japanese brokerage
firm.
   Separating the new record from the last one was the biggest
one-day crash in Wall Street history.
   Measured from its bottom at the close of Black Monday to its new
top, stock prices have gone up more than 50 percent.
   ``While nobody's paid much attention to it, it's two of the
strongest years, back to back, that we've had,'' said Lawrence R.
Helfand, managing director for retail sales at Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc.
in Chicago.
   Analysts generally believe the stock market is healthier now than
it was two years ago, when speculation inflated a bubble that burst
in the autumn of '87. Stock prices are lower in comparison to
company profits than they were at their last peak.
   The stock market has been helped by a healthy dollar, relatively
low interest rates and optimism that the economy will manage to
steer a middle course between recession and high inflation.
   Still, market watchers said there was no economic news Thursday
to put the Dow industrials over the top. The bond market finished
just slightly above even, while the dollar edged barely higher.
   ``The market's going up just on its own. When you call around,
there's no reason. It just went up,'' Brusca said.
   While nobody knows where the market will go from here, some
traders said the latest rally could draw more money that had been
sitting on the sidelines in short-term investments.
   ``The worst thing that can happen to an institutional money
manager is to sit there with a pile of cash and watch the market
take off with out him. It's a buying panic,'' Helfand said.
   In a healthy sign, volume on the floor of the Big Board was the
heaviest in more than two months at 225.52 million shares.
   ``I think it's terrific. I remain very optimistic that the market
can make further advances,'' said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist
at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.

<HEAD>Judge Rules That Texaco Polluted River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that Texaco
Inc. polluted the Delaware River over the course of four years by
discharging about 10,000 gallons a day of cooling water that
contained excess amounts of iron.
   The summary judgment, issued Monday by U.S. District Judge Jane
Roth, is a victory for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which
filed suit after both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and
the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental
Control found NRDC's complaint too minor to warrant fines or
penalties, a Delaware environmental official said.
   NRDC alleged that Texaco polluted the river from 1984 to 1988 by
dumping into the Delaware cooling water from a refinery containing
iron levels that exceeded regulatory limits.
   Between 400 million to 500 million gallons of water were
discharged daily, with about 10,000 gallons of that containing
excessive amounts of iron, said Gerard L. Esposito, director of the
state division of water resources.
   Since the suit was brought, the Delaware environmental agency
issued a new permit for Texaco that takes into account the higher
iron discharges, Esposito said.
   The court has not entered any judgment on liability and the
company has not decided if it will appeal, said John Ambler,
Texaco's senior coordinator of public and government affairs.
   Ambler denied the company was at fault.
   He said Texaco contends that the discharges at question ``were
due to sampling errors and some acts of God. Storms upset the waste
water treatment process.''
   Ambler said that the 390 samples found to be in violation were
out of ``tens of thousands'' and were ``only slightly above
permitted levels.''
   ``Since 1985, the (refinery's) waste water treatment plant has
been in over 99 percent compliance,'' he said.
   Texaco's refinery, located in Delaware City about 12 miles south
of Wilmington, refines gasoline, chemical feedstocks, petroleum coke
for utilities and gases for fuel, Ambler said. Texaco is based in
White Plains, N.Y.

<HEAD>Lorenzo Considering Sale of Continental</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. may consider selling part of its
Continental Airlines subsidiary, Chairman Frank Lorenzo said
Thursday.
   The surprise announcement comes a week after a Boston investment
firm disclosed that it owns 12 percent of Houston-based Texas Air,
the nation's largest airline company. Texas Air owns both
Continental and strikebound Eastern Airlines.
   Texas Air said it has retained Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. as an
investment adviser to discuss any transaction.
   In a statement released late Thursday, Texas Air said: ``In
answer to a question at a company management conference today, ...
Lorenzo said that the company may consider sale of a minority or
controlling position of its Continental Airlines unit and that it
has had discussions with parties who have expressed an interest in
Continental.''
   Art Kent, a spokesman at Continental's Houston headquarters,
declined to comment further on the statement.
   Last week, Loomis, Sayles &amp; Co., a Boston portfolio management
company, said its 12 percent stake in Texas Air was held for
investment because it believed the company would show a profit in
1990.
   Miami-based Eastern is in the midst of Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization. The carrier filed for protection on March 9, five
days after its Machinists, pilots and flight attendants went on
strike. Since then, it has been rebuilding as a smaller airline
using non-union workers.
   Lorenzo followed a similar path with Continental in 1983.
   ``While there are some arguments in favor of seeing Continental
emerge with new ownership, such as giving the company access to
stronger financial or marketplace resources, there are also a number
of compelling reasons why a sale of the company may not be
advisable,'' Lorenzo said in Thursday's statement.
   One of the principal reasons against selling is that the carrier
is emerging from a period of consolidations with other airlines as a
stronger company and shows potential for improved financial results,
he said.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Thursday barred the Energy
Department from awarding a $1 billion contract to a Bechtel Corp.
unit to build and manage the proposed nuclear waste dump in Nevada.
   The decision is a setback for attempts by Energy Secretary James
D. Watkins to end years of delay and political squabbling over the
waste dump project. Preliminary studies of whether the Yucca
Mountain site is suitable to hold the nuclear waste had been
scheduled to start earlier this year.
   U.S. Claims Court Judge Reginald Gibson permanently enjoined the
department from awarding the contract to anyone other than TRW Inc.,
which sued the department on grounds that the process of selecting
Bechtel was tainted.
   The department said in a statement it was disappointed and will
``review the department's options.''
   The department said it did not believe the ruling would
significantly affect its ability to carry out preliminary studies of
the area's geology to determine whether it would qualify for a
required Nuclear Regulatory Commission license.
   The Nevada state government, which strongly opposes the project,
applauded the ruling.
   ``To the people of Nevada, this is a further indication of why
the people of Nevada do not trust the Department of Energy when it
says the selection of Yucca Mountain is based on science and not
politics,'' said Larry Henry, press secretary to Gov. Bob Miller.
``This case severely weakens the DOE's credibility.''
   The actual opinion issued by Gibson was not immediately made
public but the gist of the decison, without explanation, was
contained in a brief memorandum to the parties in the suit.
   Gibson said the opinion would be kept secret at least until next
Wednesday to allow the companies involved to determine whether the
document contains any proprietary information or trade secrets that
should not be made public.
   At issue in the case is a charge by TRW, which lost in a bid for
the contract, that Energy Department officials involved in selecting
Bechtel Systems Management Inc. were guilty of a conflict of
interest.
   TRW's contention centered on the fact that Samuel Rousso, who had
a hand in selecting Bechtel, had previously worked for Science
Applications International Corp., a subcontractor to Bechtel.
   The Energy Department said immediately after Gibson's memorandum
was issued that it was preparing a public response. It said Rousso
was not available to comment.
   At Bechtel headquarters in San Francisco, spokesman Rick
Laubscher said the company was ``very disappointed'' at the ruling
but had not yet seen the actual opinion nor conferred with the
Energy Department.
   ``We have to do those things before we can speak knowledgeably on
the matter,'' Laubscher said.
   Spokesmen for TRW in Cleveland and Washington were not available
for comment, their offices said.

<HEAD>News Corp. Earnings More Than Triple On Gains From Publication Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News Corp. said Thursday its fourth-quarter
earnings more than tripled on gains from the sale of several of its
publications.
   The communications and entertainment company controlled by
publisher Rupert Murdoch said it earned $559.8 million during the
quarter ended June 30, up from $128.1 million a year earlier.
   Earnings per American Depositary Receipt (ADR) rose to $3.34 from
82 cents. ADRs are shares of foreign companies that are traded in
the United States. Each News Corp. ADR, traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, is equivalent to two of the company's common shares.
   News Corp. said it had $413.9 million in one-time gains from the
sale of its travel publications and Elle magazine during the fourth
quarter.
   Without those gains, the company said it would have earned $145.9
million, or 93 cents per ADR, during the quarter. That represents a
10 percent increase from the year-earlier period.
   News Corp. said its revenue rose to $1.84 billion from $1.21
billion in the final quarter a year earlier.
   The company said its international newspaper publishing
operations performed well, and its film and television operations in
the United States _ including 20th Century Fox and Fox Broadcasting
Co. _ were strong during the quarter.
   The company also said its earnings benefited from the acquisition
earlier in the fiscal year of Triangle Publications, the publisher
of TV Guide and other magazines.
   Fox Broadcasting had what News Corp. called ``a dramatic
turnaround,'' and nearly broke even for the year.
   For the entire fiscal year, News Corp. said it earned $944.6
million, or $5.72 per ADR, up from $341.3 million, or $2.20 per ADR,
the year before.
   Full-year revenue totaled $6.4 billion, up from $4.35 billion in
1988.

<HEAD>SEC Approves Major Faculty Pension Fund Settlement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pension fund covering most of the nation's
college faculty members will have more investment options to offer
participants under a settlement approved Thursday by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   The SEC approved an agreement, reached in December, among
Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America and College
Retirement Equities Fund and several academic and investment groups.
   Under the settlement, TIAA-CREF policyholders _ before they
retire _ will be able to transfer their funds to other investments
or take a lump sum payment in cash of their accumulated funds. Both
alternatives are subject to employer approval.
   TIAA-CREF is one of the nation's largest pension funds, with
investments of more than $60 billion on behalf of professors and
other employees of colleges and non-profit groups.
   The other signatories to the agreement are: the American Council
on Education; the American Association of University Professors; the
Investment Company Institute, a national association of 2,700 mutual
funds; the National Education Association; Stanford University;
United University Professions; and four mutual fund complexes.
   A mutual fund is an investment company that pools money from
shareholders and invests it in a variety of securities, including
stocks, bonds and money market securities.
   Some professors had been quarreling with the non-profit pension
fund in recent years over its investment rules and policies,
especially in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash.
   TIAA-CREF had sought exemptions from the Investment Company Act
of 1940, one of the laws enforced by the SEC, to allow it to
restrict how and when it would redeem, or buy back, policyholders'
shares in the money market fund.

   NutraSweet Co. announced plans Thursday to double
the production capacity for its artificial sweetener products, which
are marketed in more than 70 countries.
   The company, based in Deerfield, Ill., said its growth over the
past year has made it necessary to expand operations around the
world to meet future demand.
   ``In response to strong consumer demand in both U.S. and
international markets, we will virtually double our global capacity
over the next two years,'' NutraSweet Chairman Robert Shapiro said
in a statement.
   The subsidiary of Monsanto Co. manufactures and markets
NutraSweet worldwide and Equal tabletop sweetener in the United
States.
   By early 1990, the company plans to enlarge its U.S. plants and
open a facility currently under construction in Sao Paulo, Brazil,
officials said.
   During that same period, a partner company in Japan will also
increase its capacity.
   The sweetener is produced at facilities in University Park, Ill.,
and Augusta, Ga. The company also sells aspartame manufactured in a
European partnership with Ajinomoto Co. of Japan.
   NutraSweet spokesman Jim Prescot said the company intends to add
a new manufacturing facility at its Augusta, Ga., plant in 1991 and
also will invest in manufacturing sites in Europe.
   The low-calorie sweetener and popular sugar substitute, also
known as aspartame, is used in 3,000 products around the world,
including diet soft drinks, puddings and frozen desserts.

<HEAD>Squibb Says Officials Probing Possible Insider Trading Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Squibb Corp. officials say federal
investigators are probing possible insider trading violations
connected with Squibb's proposed merger with Bristol-Myers Co.
   A subpoena issued Tuesday to Dow Jones &amp; Co. said the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan is looking into allegations of mail and wire
fraud stemming from the proposed $11.4 billion merger of the two
pharmaceutical giants, according to a report in The Central New
Jersey Home News of New Brunswick.
   Squibb has been contacted by the Justice Department, the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange,
said John Skule, spokesman for Princeton-based Squibb. He said
company attorneys characterized the inquiries as routine data
gathering in the wake of a major merger announcement.
   Squibb officials did not disclose when they were contacted, who
was interviewed or what information was being sought.
   A spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers, reading from a statement, said
the New York company is cooperating fully with the SEC and the stock
exchange, but made no mention of Justice Department inquiries. The
company, said the spokeswoman, is not aware of any indication of
wrongdoing in the merger. She declined to comment further.
   Dow Jones, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, was ordered
to turn over copies of news reports on Squibb issued July 25 to July
27 _ the day the merger was announced _ and to verify the times when
the items were issued.
   On July 26, Dow Jones' Professional Investor Report noted Wall
Street speculation about a major pharmaceutical industry takeover,
but quoted analysts who discounted the speculation.
   The subpoena also ordered a Dow Jones official to appear before a
grand jury Friday at the U.S. District Court in New York.
   A Dow Jones spokesman, Charlie Stabler, said the company would
not provide the materials requested because they are available in
the public domain.
   Officials of the three agencies refused to confirm or deny their
was an investigation.
   Squibb's stock rose from $24.75 a share to $112.50 on July 27,
the day the merger was announced. The deal was disclosed before the
markets opened that day.
   Under the terms of the merger, expected to be finalized in
October, Squibb shareholders will receive 2.4 shares of
Bristol-Myers stock for each share of Squibb. The new company,
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., will become the world's second-largest
pharmaceutical house, after Merck &amp; Co. of Rahway.
   In the three days prior to the announcement, Squibb shares rose
nearly $5 per share on active trading as Wall Street observers
speculated that a buyout of Squibb was in the works. Rumors focused
on Glaxo, a British drug giant.

<HEAD>Bell Atlantic Subsidiary Settles on Local Issues</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `Elsewhere among ...,' to UPDATE with Illinois
Bell talks breaking down. Also moving on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking members of the Communications Workers
of America reached tentative agreement on local issues Thursday with
Bell Atlantic's Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co., company and
union officials said.
   But none of the 41,000 employees who work for C&amp;P and other Bell
Atlantic subsidiaries will return to work until local issues are
settled at all the companies, union officials said. The strike began
Aug. 6.
   Basic agreement on economic issues throughout the
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic system was reached a week ago.
   Talks on local issues with Bell of Pennsylvania and Diamond State
Telephone in Delaware are still snagged, the CWA said.
   Elsewhere among the Bell operating companies, CWA representatives
returned to the bargaining table with subsidiaries of Ameritech,
serving 12.3 million customers in Illinois, Michigan, Ohio,
Wisconsin and Indiana. Those talks were aimed at a basic agreement
on economic issues. The Illinois Bell sessions broke off abruptly
with each side blaming the other for lack of progress.
   CWA represents Bell Atlantic workers in Delaware, Maryland, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of
Columbia.
   C&amp;P serves phone customers in the District of Columbia, Maryland,
Virginia and West Virginia. The union represents 21,000 C&amp;P workers.
   ``We're pleased to have settled issues of job security and work
rules with C&amp;P Telephone,'' said CWA Vice President Peter Catucci.
``But we're dismayed by the retrogressive demands still on the
table'' at Bell and Diamond State.
   New Jersey Bell settled its local issues with the CWA earlier in
the week.
   ``We're glad there's a tentative settlement in the C&amp;P walkout,
and we look forward to getting everyone back to work,'' said Bell
Atlantic spokesman Larry Plumb.
   Bell of New Jersey must also reach agreement with 9,100 members
of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   Negotiators for C&amp;P and the union met for about an hour early
Thursday afternoon before the settlement was announced. They had
recessed the talks early in the morning after progress had been
reported ``on all fronts,'' according to the company.
   The local C&amp;P issues involved such things as work rules and the
contracting of work traditionally done by union employees to outside
firms. Details were not immediately known.

<HEAD>J.H. Whitney Partners Take Seats On New Prime Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc.'s board of directors resigned
Thursday to make way for nominees backed by J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a
New York venture capital firm that stepped in as the computer
company was battling a hostile takeover.
   The resignations were part of a $1 billion-plus buyout that puts
J.H. Whitney in control of the Natick-based minicomputer maker,
which has suffered major losses during its 10-month battle against
MAI Basic Four Inc. of Tustin, Calif.
   After Prime board members were re-elected at the annual meeting
Thursday, all but one stepped down after electing four Whitney
nominees to the board. Incumbent director John S. Dulaney was to
remain on the board until Whitney completes its tender offer next
week, officials said.
   The new board immediately elected James F. McDonald as Prime's
new president. He succeeds Anthony L. Craig, who has held the post
since November and chose to resign after Whitney completes its
tender offer.
   New board members include Whitney partners Russell E. Planitzer,
Don E. Ackerman and Peter M. Castleman. Also named was George C.
Sheinberg, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Resigning from the board were David J. Dunn, Frank P. Brunetta,
Anthony L. Craig, John E. Nolan, Jr., John E. Sheehan and Harold A.
Strickland.
   Whitney has tendered a $20-a-share offer for 49.5 million shares
of Prime common stock, which the company accepted a week ago. The
firm also offered to exchange notes with a face value of $22 a share
for the remaining 21 percent of Prime's shares.
   Securities analysts said those notes would trade at a discount.
They estimated the total value of the deal at $17 to $18.50 a share,
or $1.06 billion to $1.16 billion.
   Prime netted a profit of $19 million on sales of $1.6 billion in
1988. But in the last three quarters it recorded over $38 million in
losses, which it attributed to the cost of defending itself against
the takeover and slow sales of minicomputers.
