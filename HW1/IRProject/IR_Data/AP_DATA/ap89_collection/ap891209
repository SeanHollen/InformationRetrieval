   Publisher Morton Frank, chairman emeritus of the
Sunday newspaper supplement USA Weekend, died of complications
following heart surgery in Bridgeport, Conn., his son said Friday.
He was 77.
   Frank died late Thursday at Bridgeport Hospital, said his son,
Allan Dodds Frank, a correspondent with ABC News in New York.
   For 14 years, Frank was in charge of Family Weekly, now called
USA Weekend. During his tenure, circulation grew from about 3
million in fewer than 100 newspapers to more than 13 million in
more than 360 newspapers. Frank arranged the sale of the
publication in 1976; it is now owned by Gannett Co. Inc.
   Frank also was on the board of the American Journal of Nursing
Publishing and of Horizon Communications Inc., publishers of Vista,
a national newspaper supplement targeted at Hispanics.
   A native of Pitcairn, Pa., Frank earned gradyated from the
University of Michigan in 1933. He received a law degree from
Alfred University in 1979.
   Frank started his career as an advertising manager for the Daily
News Herald in Braddock, Pa., and a year later was named editor of
the Braddock Free Press. He next worked for the Pittsburgh Press
for six years, as an advertising salesman, entertainment writer and
manager of rotogravure.
   During World War II, Frank was an intelligence officer and
gunnery officer before becoming executive officer of the Navy's
Fleet Home Town News Service.
   In 1946, he worked for the Arizona Times before moving to
Canton, Ohio, with his first wife, Agnes Dodds. There they owned,
edited and published weekly newspapers including the Canton
Economist and the Stark County Times.
   Divorced in 1958, Frank married Elizabeth Pope, a magazine
editor, in 1963. The couple lived in New York and Easton, Conn.
   Frank is survived by his wife; his son Allan; another son,
Michael Robert Frank, an independent record producer in Chicago,
and a daughter, Marilyn Morton Frank, an actress in Chicago.

<TEXT>
   President Bush will get a musical
reminder about the plight of homeless veterans when a group of
doctors performs at the White House next week.
   Dr. Frederick Richardson, chief of rehabilitative medicine at
the West Haven Veterans Administration, said he will sing ``A
Soldier's Carol,'' when the National Medical Group sings Christmas
carols for Bush and his family on Wednesday. The group was formed
seven years ago to sing for patients.
   The song tells of a soldier serving in a foreign land. Crouching
in a foxhole, he sees a bright star and thinks about Christmas and
his home.
   It continues:
   ``Now I'm home for Christmas
   ``My home is on the ground.
   ``Family all have left me,
   ``And strangers all around.
   ``It isn't what I fought for
   ``But what is there to say.
   ``I fought for flag and country.
   ``Please God, help me this day.''

<HEAD>Plaintiff in Prominent Abortion Case Reunited with Last Missing Child</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY L. CARTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who was the anonymous plaintiff in one of
two landmark U.S. Supreme Court decisions legalizing abortion said
Friday she will be reunited with the last of the children taken
from her 20 years ago.
   Sandra Cano, who was identified as Mary Doe in Doe vs. Bolton,
said her 22-year-old daughter April will fly to Atlanta from
Seattle on Saturday. It will be their first meeting in more than 17
years.
   The Supreme Court's decision in Doe vs. Bolton, which struck
down Georgia's abortion law, was issued Jan. 22, 1973, the same day
the court struck down Texas' abortion law in the more famous case
labeled Roe vs. Wade.
   Earlier this year Sandra Cano was reunited with the daughter
involved in that case. Mrs. Cano said she gave that child, Melissa,
up for adoption in 1970 after deciding not to go through with the
abortion.
   Mrs. Cano, of suburban Atlanta, noted that two older children, a
son Joel and a daughter April, had been taken from her a year
before that. She said she lost custody of the children after a
dispute with a sitter and ``because of me being young and naive.''
   Mrs. Cano, whose name was Sandra Bensing at the time, said she
tried to regain custody of the children from the family they had
been placed with and finally got the boy 12 years ago, when he was
11. She has not seen the girl, however, since 1972.
   Child welfare officials thought it best that the family not be
reunited. ``Family and Children Services just kept telling me she
was happily adopted and to let her alone,'' Mrs. Cano said in a
telephone interview.
   She said she managed to track the adoptive parents to Columbus
and then Denver, but hit a dead end eight years ago. In November, a
week after Thanksgiving, April called.
   Mrs. Cano said her daughter told her she had been trying to find
her mother since being abandoned by her adoptive family and placed
in a mental hospital at age 14.
   She said her adoptive father, who refused to have anything to do
with her, was the one who finally told her to contact Georgia
social services, leading her to her birth mother.
   Now that she has her family back, Mrs. Cano said, she plans to
increase her involvement in the pro-life movement. Because of her
connection to the court case and her present stand against
abortion, she has been invited to represent the anti-abortion
position on talk shows and at meetings.
   After she identified herself as the case's Mary Doe in February,
she said, her car was shot at, two trucks were stolen and graffiti
was scrawled on another vehicle.
   She and her husband moved out of Atlanta to a suburb, she said,
declining to identify their hometown.
   ``I'm going to start coming out, start speaking out and being
more active now, because we've got the children back,'' she said.
``Not many people get that second chance.''

   The Army Cadets were minus one of their
veterans in today's college football game against Navy.
   Black Jack, one of three mules used as mascots at the U.S.
Military Academy, died of stomach cancer on Thursday. West Point
officials said Friday there was nothing suspicious about the death.
   ``The timing was curious but there was no foul play,'' West
Point spokesman Col. Nick Hawthorne said.
   He said the other two mules, 21-year-old Spartacus and
16-year-old Ranger, were to be at today's game at Giants Stadium in
East Rutherford, N.J.
   Mules became the West Point mascot in 1899, when Navy's football
team showed up with a goat at the game. Army fans retaliated by
borrowing a mule from an ice wagon.

   You've seen flashing lights, glowing Santas
and red-nosed Rudolphs plugged in to mark the Christmas season.
Arlene Lederman opted for something different this year: an
electric chair.
   The antiques shop owner is sending shock waves along Main Street
in Nyack with the oak chair, the centerpiece of her store's holiday
window display. Lederman, a member of Amnesty International, said
the display symbolizes her opposition to the death penalty.
   ``It's a good time to make people look,'' Lederman said. ``There
are certain times people look at windows and Christmas is one time
people do a lot of Christmas window shopping.''
   The chair, decked with holiday lights, is surrounded by
polyester snow and an art deco sled. Inside the store, Lederman
provides her customers with anti-death penalty literature.
   Lederman found the chair at a renovation site in Newark, N.J.
Since the display went up on Wednesday, Lederman has heard plenty
about it in the town 25 miles north of New York City.
   ``Some people don't like it. They don't think it's in the
Christmas spirit. I could have put up little Santas and toys, but I
decided to see what happened when I did this.''
   There have been a few nasty phone calls and sarcastic remarks
such as, ``Why don't you put Santa Claus in there and burn him?''
she said. Other callers have offered support.
   ``We've made mistakes with capital punishment and there's
nothing you can do. There's no reprieve,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are reining in Florida's
largest savings and loan, CenTrust Bank of Miami, which lavished
millions of dollars on expensive art, yachts, corporate jets and
limousines.
   CenTrust called the action unnecessary, saying the thrift was in
its best financial condition in five years.
   In a legal order issued Friday, the Office of Thrift Supervision
told the institution to sell what's left of its $29 million art
collection, some of which had been kept at the home of CenTrust
Chairman David L. Paul.
   It forbid CenTrust from increasing its executives' salaries or
paying dividends to stockholders, told it to sell its limousines,
jet and a $233,000 sailboat known as ``Bodacious.'' Within 90 days,
the institution must stop paying the crew and other expenses for
the yacht owned by Paul, ``Grand Cru.''
   The thrift office said in a statement that it issued the order
to ``curb serious dissipation of the institution's assets'' after
determining that CenTrust had ``engaged in regulatory violations
and unsafe or unsound practices.''
   Paul, in a statement issued in Miami, criticized the OTS action.
   ``The OTS is clearly trying to use CenTrust as a test case to
impose its views on the thrift industry after it failed to get its
views adopted by the accounting profession,'' Paul said. ``Our
financial statements ... have been reviewed by a leading accounting
firm and found to be in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
   ``We intend to vigorously contest this unilateral and misguided
OTS action.''
   S&amp;L bailout legislation enacted in August ``gave us the
enforcement power to move quickly, and we are taking full advantage
of this authority,'' said thrift office director M. Danny Wall.
   However, a private analyst said CenTrust will almost certainly
fail and that the ``cease and desist'' order came too late to save
taxpayers much money.
   ``Centrust is a gone institution. I think the order in and of
itself isn't going to do anything. The damage has been done,'' said
Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.
   At the end of June, CenTrust was reporting assets of $9.7
billion, making it the nation's 22nd largest S&amp;L and Florida's
biggest. It was $43.3 million in the red, as measured by tangible
capital, having slipped over the previous year from being in the
black by $12.89 million.
   The S&amp;L and its 71 branch offices remain open during normal
business hours, with all deposit accounts federally insured to
$100,000. CenTrust has been seeking federal approval to sell 63 of
its branches and deposit accounts assigned to those offices to
Great Western Bank of Beverly Hills, Calif., the nation's
second-largest S&amp;L.
   Ely speculated that the thrift office's order was issued to buy
time until the branch sales can go through.
   One provision of the order forbids CenTrust from further sale of
its uninsured debt to its retail customers. Such sales have drawn
the close scrutiny of Congress since the spring when 22,000
customers lost an estimated $250 million by purchasing the debt of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Irvine, Calif.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a House Banking Committee member
who is sponsoring legislation banning S&amp;Ls from selling debt
through their branch offices, said CenTrust's debt also was
``potentially worthless.''
   Earlier, it received permission from the thrift office to sell
$50 million in debt in minimum denominations of $2,000.
   Schumer said thrift office records show that shaky S&amp;Ls are more
likely to issue their debt in small denominations, which attracts
unsophisticated investors who can be misled into thinking they are
buying insured certificates of deposit.
   CenTrust, under orders from state regulators, has already sold
much of its 22-painting collection, bought for $29 million,
including ``Portrait of a Man as Mars'' by Flemish master Peter
Paul Rubens.
   According to the thrift office, CenTrust also spent $329,000 on
four sculptures, $208,000 for four oriental rugs and $84,000 for
crystal stemware. Maintenance and hangar fees for its corporate jet
exceeded $1 million a year. It spent $26,000 a year to lease a
Mercedes Benz limousine in Miami and $40,000 to buy a Lincoln
limousine maintained in New York.
   Despite CenTrust's deteriorating condition, its chairman's
compensation increased from $550,000 a year in 1988 to $950,000 a
year currently. Over the period, he also received bonuses, stock
dividends and insurance benefits worth nearly $4 million.
   Additionally, the thrift paid $308,000 from January 1987 through
July 1989 for guard services at his home and spent $45,000 in 1988
to put the chairman up for 35 nights at the Stanhope Hotel in New
York City.
   As part of the order, CenTrust was required to make its books
and records immediately available to federal regulators, who began
examining the institution May 31 and complained that they were
denied access to records.
   CenTrust's books ``are so incomplete'' that examiners cannot
determine its true financial condition, the thrift office said.
   CenTrust stock, which had been selling on the American Stock
Exchange for as much as $6.87{ within the past year, on Friday fell
from $1.37{ to $1 at the close of trading.

<HEAD>Administration May Relax Ban on High-Tech Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, in the wake of the
Malta summit and the dramatic changes occurring in the Communist
bloc, is reviewing whether to relax the ban on sale of
high-technology exports to Communist countries.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said in an interview Friday
that he expected the administration would reach a decision by
April, predicting that Poland and Hungary could be early
beneficiaries of a more liberalized policy.
   The dispute involves a 40-year-old prohibition intended to keep
high technology products with military applications from falling
into Communist hands.
   The administration is under growing pressure to ease the
controls as a way of boosting the economic and political reforms
sweeping through Eastern Europe.
   Western allies argue that with Cold War frictions easing, it is
important for the West to supply the technology needed for
Communist countries to boost living standards.
   Controls on high-technology exports are administered by the
Coordinating Committee on Multinational Export Controls, known as
COCOM. It consists of the 15 NATO nations along with Japan and
Australia.
   Mosbacher said the administration hoped to reach a decision on
easing controls in time to present the proposals at the next
meeting of COCOM, scheduled for early April in Paris.
   Mosbacher said that Hungary and Poland are already discussing
with U.S. officials how to prevent the transfer of militarily
strategic items to neighboring Communist bloc countries. He said
that such assurances would allow the United States to look
favorably on giving those two countries access to more
sophisticated technology.
   ``Everybody is discussing what we should be doing about Eastern
Europe, whether it is politically, economically or
technologically,'' Mosbacher said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   The United States is considering ``a shortening of the list (of
restricted items) to those things which are truly important and
essential,'' Mosbacher said in a separate interview taped for
public television's American Interests program.
   ``The shortening will be substantial ... that would be our
recommendation,'' he said.
   The administration has been split between hardliners such as
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who oppose the easing for national
security reasons, and others such as Mosbacher, who argue that
liberalization is needed in light of the changes.
   Mosbacher was the third administration official in recent days
to discuss the possibility of lowering export controls. Similar
comments about possible changes have also been made by Treasury
Undersecretary David Mulford and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger.
   Eagleburger said the United States planned to eliminate the
case-by-case approval required to export ``dual use''
high-technology items to other COCOM members.
   ``Dual use'' refers to technology that has both commercial and
military applications. The United States has repeatedly clashed
with its allies, especially West Germany, Italy and Japan, over
what it argues are violations of COCOM rules regarding dual use
technology.
   In the latest such case, the administration accused the Italian
computer manufacturer Olivetti of selling the Soviet Union
computerized machine tools that the Soviets used to make jet
fighter engines.
   In a speech last week, Eagleburger said the requirement for
individual licenses will be lifted within six months.
   Referring to the question of easing restrictions on exports to
Eastern Europe, Eagleburger said the ``nature of the military
threat faced by the West is changing'' and the West needed to
``signal our clear willingness to respond constructively to the
democratization under way in Eastern Europe.''

<HEAD>Traffic Safety Head Opposes On-Board Vapor Units</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's top highway safety official
says devices inside cars to capture gas vapors when a tank is being
filled would pose safety risks.
   ``It appears to be an idea whose time has not come,'' Jerry R.
Curry said Friday in his first speech since being sworn in last
week as administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
   Curry said the agency will join safety groups in opposing
legislation that would require the units on all new cars. A bill
supported by environmental groups and the oil industry is pending
in the House.
   Curry said his agency's first priority in dealing with auto and
truck issues would continue to be highway safety, followed by
better gas mileage and clean air.
   The former Army major general said NHTSA's technical evaluations
show that some important safety concerns remain with the systems to
capture gas vapor and return it to a car's engine through a special
holding unit containing charcoal.
   Curry said there have been problems even with some of the simple
systems cars have had since 1971 for returning some vapor to the
gas tank, which have resulted in fires, injuries and vehicle
recalls.
   Several areas of the country require gasoline stations to equip
their hoses with units that suck vapors back into the station's
tank. The requirements often are part of state and city efforts to
meet Environmental Protection Agency air quality standards.
   Curry said NHTSA supports the idea of a vapor recovery system
and will continue to work with the EPA to test proposals for
effectiveness and safety.
   On other issues, Curry said he:
   _Supported laws requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets, saying
he would wage a campaign of letters and support legislation to
require them.
   _Would base future recommendations for auto mileage standards,
or Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, ``on facts, not
on theology.'' Environmentalists are pushing for tighter standards,
but auto manufacturers say that would prevent them from building
many larger cars and could decrease overall auto safety.

<TEXT>
   This Christmas season is bittersweet for
striking coal miners, who've been living off meager union payments
for eight months but enjoying a groundswell of support from workers
around the country and the world.
   Other unions are shipping tons of donated food, clothing and
toys to the Virginia coal fields, where the United Mine Workers and
Pittston Coal Group Inc. are locked in a strike that began just
after Easter.
   Members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Women's
Network in Pennsylvania and New Jersey today are bringing toys,
treats and clothes to the Russell County Fairgrounds, where they'll
sing Christmas carols for miners' families.
   During Thanksgiving week, the United Auto Workers had a 15- to
20-pound turkey delivered to each striking miner's family.
   ``This is going to be a terrific Christmas for the strikers'
kids because of the support that we've got from other unions around
the world,'' said Joel Phillips, a striker who supports a wife and
two daughters. ``This may be one of the best Christmases they've
ever had.''
   The strike has become a symbolic line in the sand for members of
the U.S. labor movement who want to stop the erosion of collective
bargaining.
   They portray Pittston as the prime example of a union-busting
company. Pittston officials say they are offering a fair contract
and are being unfairly targeted by the union's national leadership.
   The strike started after Pittston bolted from a contract between
the UMW and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, saying
health benefits offered by the owners' group were too generous.
   Labor solidarity with the miners was bolstered in October when
UMW President Richard Trumka brought the union, which had been
independent for 40 years, back into the AFL-CIO.
   Strikers say Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole's interest in
resolving the strike only increased after an official of Poland's
Solidarity movement visited the coal fields in November and
criticized treatment of the miners in a meeting with Mrs. Dole.
   About $300,000 has been donated to a Christmas fund set up for
the miners on Nov. 10. The money will be distributed next week to
families of the 2,100 striking and laid-off miners in Virginia,
West Virginia and Kentucky.
   ``We've had people calling from all around the contry wanting to
send money or donate food or clothing,'' said Fred Wallace, a
striking miner and the Christmas fund trustee. ``It seems like
people are getting into the Christmas feeling that giving is better
than receiving.''
   ``They see the hardships we're going through,'' said Phillips,
35.
   Thomas Smith, 42, an electrician, said he would use his share of
the Christmas fund to buy winter coats for his two children. But
what his family really needs, he said, is for him to get back to
work.
   ``It won't be the happiest Christmas,'' Smith said. ``With all
this support it's not going to be all that grim. But we still don't
know what tomorrow is going to bring.''
   Union and company negotiators are planning to meet Monday in
northern Virginia for another round of contract talks mediated by
former Labor Secretary William Usery.
   Usery is optimistic that the negotiations will lead to a
settlement, but striking miners are skeptical.
   ``Nobody thinks it will be settled by Christmas,'' Smith said.
   The miners are preparing for the strike to last through winter
and on Thursday opened an indoor rally site, Camp Solidarity II,
near Logan, W.Va., to demonstrate their resolve.
   The miners, used to earning as much as $635 a week, have been
receiving $225 a week in strike wages, and that pays only for
necessities, Wallace said. In many cases, wives who did not work
before the strike have taken jobs.
   ``Things have gotten tight,'' Wallace said. ``You just hold off
on the luxuries of life when you're on strike and not working.''

   The attempt was called off Friday about two hours before the
planned liftoff when a storm dumped heavy rain on the launch area.
   The delay will last at least until next week because a Delta
rocket scheduled for Sunday carries a military navigation satellite
for the Defense Department and has priority.
   Officials said the Titan could be delayed until later in
December because it also has lower priority than both the Titan II
missile launch scheduled next week and the flight of the Space
Shuttle Columbia planned for Dec. 18.
   The flight was to have marked Martin Marietta's entry into the
highly competitive commercial launch business. Liftoff had been
postponed on Thursday night by a computer software problem.

<HEAD>US Sends Battleship New Jersey Into Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon officials say the battleship New
Jersey has entered the Persian Gulf _ the first time such a U.S.
warship has sailed the sensitive waterway in modern times.
   Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Keith Schneider said Friday that
the 58,000-ton vessel entered the gulf Thursday night on a
``routine operation to demonstrate a continuing U.S. commitment to
the region.''
   The oil-rich gulf was the scene for much of the decade of
hostilities between Iran and Iraq, marked by fighting that sank or
damaged more than 500 commercial ships and killed 300 people.
   The United States sharply expanded its naval force in the region
in 1987, using it to protect merchant ships flying U.S. flags.
After the August 1988 truce between the two nations, the United
States reduced its naval presence.
   One Pentagon official, commenting on condition he not be
identified by name, said port calls in Bahrain and the United Arab
Emirates are scheduled for the warship, but that a U.S. offer to
have the ship visit a port in Saudi Arabia was turned down.
   Schneider said he could not disclose the ship's schedule nor the
ports it planned to visit. He did say the battleship was not being
accompanied by a battle group of support vessels.
   While U.S. battleships have entered the Straits of Hormuz, which
links the Persian Gulf to the northern Arabian Sea, none has ever
sailed deep into the waterway that divides Iran from the Saudi
Arabian peninsula, other sources said.
   Navy spokesman Craig Quigley, who said he could not confirm the
movement of the battleship, said the service ``doesn't have a
record that indicates a battleship has been in the Persian Gulf in
modern times.''

<TEXT>
   While most European Communist
nations surge toward democracy, Yugoslavia, once a socialist
showcase, is sinking ever deeper into its apparently unending
political crisis.
   Faced with ethnic and social tensions, rapidly growing inflation
and labor unrest, the country is now split into what looks like an
unbridgeable rift between two of its six republics _ Slovenia and
Serbia.
   Some lawmakers, newspapers and organizations even raise the
issue of civil war.
   In an unprecedented move, Serbia on Nov. 29 severed all
political and business ties with the northern region of Slovenia
after authorities there banned a rally planned by Serbs seeking to
topple Slovenia's liberal leadership.
   Except for a desperate warning that the country's unity is
``seriously'' threatened by the clash, Yugoslavia's divided
leadership has done nothing to ease tensions.
   Yugoslavia has for years been a socialist showcase despite its
one-party system, with a relatively free press and no travel
restrictions.
   But its political, economic and social problems have mushroomed
since the death in 1980 of President Josip Broz Tito, whose
charisma was seen as a major force in keeping Yugoslavia together
and submerging regional tensions.
   The man in the center of Yugoslavia's current turmoil is
Serbia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, described in Slovenia and
some other republics as ``a Stalinist, dogmatist and totalitarian
leader.''
   In his speech to the Serbian Parliament Tuesday, Milosevic
denounced the Slovenian leadership for not allowing an
anti-Slovenian rally by Serbs planned in the Slovenian city of
Ljubljana.
   Milosevic vowed that Serbia will not re-establish ties with
Slovenia ``until the conservative, aggressive and brutal''
Slovenian leaders step down.
   Commenting on Milosevic's speech, the Croatian Vjesnik daily
said Thursday that the Serbian leader's ``stubborn ultimatum'' is
aimed at imposing his hard-line brand of Communist orthodoxy on the
rest of the country.
   The newspaper described as ``grotesque'' Milosevic's accusations
against Slovenia and appealed to the country's leadership to stop
the Serbian president and prevent him from ``leading the country to
civil war.''
   Similarly, Radio Zagreb last week said, ``Yugoslavia is on the
verge of war with itself.''
   Milosevic has purged thousands of opponents in Serbia, and
several independent political and human rights groups, which are
growing elswhere in the country, have been banned in the southern
republic.
   On Thursday, a prominent Serbian journalist appeared in court to
answer charges of leading an unofficial gathering that described
Milosevic's recent re-election as Serbia's president as
``undemocratic.''
   In Slovenia, its liberal-minded leadership advocates regional
autonomy and has already legalized several opposition parties that
are to contest the first-ever free, multiparty elections in postwar
Yugoslavia, scheduled in Slovenia for March.
   ``Serbia's move against Slovenia represents an attack by a
totalitarian concept of (Communist) party monopoly against all who
strive for democratic reforms and whose oppinions differ from those
of Serbian political leaders,'' said a statement released by
Slovenian Central Committee.
   Slovenian leaders believe Milosevic wants to provoke a showdown
with their republic in order to turn public attention away from his
economic and political failures.
   An announced $1 billion public loan, described as a centerpiece
of Milosevic's economic policies in Serbia, has all but collapsed
when government officials were able to secure only about 3 percent
of the planned sum.
   Despite Milosevic's promises to halt ethnic Albanian unrest in
the southern Serbian province of Kosovo, disturbances there have
continued unabated.
   Yugoslavia's parliament is to meet next week for an urgent
session to discuss the country's crisis.
   ``Comrades, our country is falling appart,'' said a
parliamentary deputy Thursday.
   Western diplomats in Belgrade point out that the split within
Yugoslavia could not have come at a worse time for the reformist
government of Premier Ante Markovic, which is currently negotiating
with the International Monetary Fund on obtaining crucial new loans
designed to repay the country's $17 billion foreign debt.
   The diplomats say Milosevic's ``irrational moves'' could
collapse the delicate negotiations that began Thursday, thereby
threatening radical market-oriented reforms Markovic is trying to
implement in Yugoslavia.

   A politician has unleashed comedian Jackie Mason
again, despite the fallout Mason caused during the New York mayoral
race.
   Mason met with Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., in a very public lunch
Friday that Mason said was aimed at creating a higher profile for
Specter, though his re-election campaign isn't until 1992.
   Specter said he and Mason had met last year in Washington for
lunch _ ``I still have the receipt in my pocket,'' the senator
cracked _ and they have stayed in touch since then.
   ``All my life I heard there was no such thing as a free lunch.
But whenever I see a senator eating, he's eating for free,'' Mason
said.
   The two men posed for photographs after lunch at Elaine's and
Specter said he was unworried about any fallout. Mason created
problems for GOP mayoral hopeful Rudolph Giuliani earlier in the
year with a perceived slur against blacks.
   ``Jackie's speaking for himself. I'll deny everything Jackie
says,'' Specter joked.
   Though Mason was apologetic after his remarks during the
campaign, he was back to his nose-thumbing self on Friday.
   ``It's the same jokes I told on Broadway for two years. I got a
Tony Award for those jokes,'' said Mason.

<HEAD>Quayle Tells Soviets They May Like Star Wars After All</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle says the Soviets may
find they like Star Wars after all.
   ``I have a hunch, over a longer period of time, the more the
Soviet Union thinks about the SDI, there may be a change of heart,
because this is defending against ballistic missiles, not just a
threat from the U.S., but a threat from other countries,'' Quayle
said in an interview published Friday in the Soviet daily newspaper
Izvestia.
   The Strategic Defense Initiative ``makes sense for both sides,''
Quayle said in the interview conducted Thursday in Washington.
   SDI calls for a space-based high technology network that would
shoot down incoming enemy missiles. U.S.-Soviet disagreement over
the plan, long a bone of contention between the two superpowers,
wrecked the 1986 summit in Reykjavik, Iceland.
   ``As we look at this world in the future, becoming less
dependent on offensive weapons for deterrence, reducing (but not
eliminating) offensive strategic weapons, we'll see other countries
gaining ballistic missile technology,'' the vice president said.
   ``Instead of having only the ability of going in and attacking
after an attack, you might want the Soviet Union to have a more
effective defense than it has today _ against Third World threats.
   ``The Soviet Union has always thought in terms of defense _
strategic and conventional _ so SDI, which was a sticking point in
the past, perhaps will not be in the future.''
   Quayle said he regarded the Malta summit between President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev as ``very positive'' meeting
that could lead to conclusion of an agreement on strategic nuclear
arms by the next summit next summer.
   ``Neither side is going to do anything to jeopardize its
security by rushing,'' he said. ``But we'd like to meet that
timetable. By making that statement, we're making a significant
step forward.
   ``So, we're very hopeful for improved relationship, for new
opportunities for reduction of tensions. But as we are hopeful, we
must also maintain our preparedness, and that we will do.
   ``As you see those reforms take place in the Soviet Union, there
will continue to be improvement and perhaps you can say, then, that
indeed the Cold War is over. But it depends on whether the
democratic values that President Gorbachev talks about can actually
be implemented.''
   Regarding Central America, Quayle said that ``the Soviet people
need to ask the question: Why are we spending $7 billion on Cuba
when we could be spending it on meat and food and assistance back
home?''

<HEAD>Cheney Approves Plans for National Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has approved
plans to increase National Guard support in the war against illicit
drugs, the Pentagon says.
   Congress authorized $450 million for Department of Defense
anti-drug programs in fiscal 1990, with some $70 million used to
fund specific state and territorial anti-drug plans, the Pentagon
said in a statement Friday.
   The largest allotments went to border states, such as Texas with
$10,936,000; California $7,991,000; Florida $6,037,000; and New
York $4,912,000.
   The decisions on the allotments were made by the Department of
Defense ``in coordination with the federal law enforcement
agencies,'' the statement said.
   While the Guard may not take part in such law enforcement
activities as arrests and seizures, the Pentagon said the
activities outlined in some of the plans include: radar
surveillance; detection and monitoring of drug smuggling through
air surveillance; aerial photography; assistance in searching
containers; transportation of law enforcement personnel, equipment
and seized substances; expanded training of law enforcement
personnel; and increased loans of military equipment.
   Here are the approved plans and amounts culled from plans
submitted from the governors of 53 states and territories. New
Hamsphire did not submit a plan.

   The Veterans Affairs Department will close
centers in five cities and create new headquarters in Jackson,
Miss., and Baltimore in an attempt to consolidate its seven
regional medical offices into four.
   VA spokesman Don Smith said Friday that regional medical offices
would be closed in Dallas; Albany, N.Y.; Durham, N.C.; Gainesville,

   Ann Arbor, Mich., and San Francisco would keep their medical
center headquarters, with Ann Arbor serving the Midwest and San

   Smith said Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski hopes to have
the plan in place by May 1990. Derwinski also wants to close the
VA's 27 district medical offices around in the country.

<NOTE>Navy Charges Two With Conspiracy to Commit Espionage</NOTE>

   Two sailors from the USS Fairfax County are
facing charges they conspired to pass secret information to a
foreign agent, the Naval Investigative Service says.
   The agency said Friday that it did not believe the sailors had
actually passed any classified information but that the case was
under review.
   The sailors, Charles Edward Schoof, 20, and John Joseph Haeger,
19, both petty officers third class, were arrested Dec. 1 while the
ship was at Little Creek, Va., the Navy said. Their hometowns were
not available.
   The two, operations specialists with access to classified
information, were charged with conspiracy to commit espionage. The
Navy declined to identify the foreign nation whose agent was
alleged to be involved.
   Navy officials also declined to describe the material the
sailors were accused of conspiring to disclose beyond saying it was
classified secret.
   The two sailors are in pre-trial detention awaiting
court-martial by the Navy.

<HEAD>Bush Hits the Campaign Trail for GOP Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is back in the snowy capital
today after spending two days on the campaign trail in a
three-state swing to drum up support for Republican Senate
candidates and reverse GOP political fortunes.
   Bush stumped Friday for Rep. Tom Tauke in Des Moines, the last
stop in two days of appearances that included fund-raising events
for Senate candidates Hank Brown in Colorado and Phil Gramm in
Texas.
   Iowa Republicans hoped Bush's appearance would give Tauke an
early boost in his underdog bid to unseat first-term Democratic
Sen. Thomas Harkin.
   Bush canceled plans to spend the weekend at the Camp David
presidential retreat in the Maryland countryside when a snowstorm
swept the region Friday. He opted to stay at the White House
instead.
   The president arrived in Iowa on a day when the Des Moines
Register published a poll showing his approval rating at 74 percent
statewide. But Republicans acknowledged a tough road ahead for
Tauke.
   Rep. Jim Lightfoot said Friday night that the party faces ``one
of the toughest most difficult years that any of us have gone
through'' before the November 1990 election.
   Bush helped raise $250,000 for Tauke in what Tauke aides said
was the biggest single political fund-raiser in the state's history.
   ``His values reflect the greatness of Iowa,'' Bush said,
praising Tauke's Washington record.
   Earlier Friday, Bush was in Colorado at a luncheon for Rep. Hank
Brown, the Republican congressman who hopes to succeed retiring
Republican Sen. William Armstrong.
   Republicans have pinned their hopes on Brown to retain the seat
for the GOP and would consider it a crushing blow to lose the seat,
one top Bush adviser said.
   The night before, Bush helped Gramm raise $2.4 million in a
Houston Astrodome dinner.
   Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater, who
accompanied Bush on the two-day trip, said that was the most
lucrative single political event in the nation's history.
   However, Gramm, a one-time Democrat who enjoys solid backing in
Texas, is not considered to be in any danger for re-election.
Speculation persists that he has presidential ambitions.
   Sending Bush on the political trail is part of the GOP strategy
as the party tries to reverse its dismal 1989 election record that
followed Bush's resounding victory in the 1988 presidential race.
   In November, the GOP lost gubernatorial races in New Jersey and
Virginia and the mayor's race in New York, all campaigns in which
Bush personally campaigned.
   Last week, a Republican stronghold district in San Diego,
Calif., elected Democrat Lucy Killea to the State Senate. The
election followed a campaign rocked by a Catholic bishop's public
censure of Killea for her pro-choice position on abortion.
   Atwater, acknowledging the party's losses, remarked to reporters
that he had a far happier year in 1988, but insisted the party's
fortunes will turn around in 1990.
   The GOP hopes to get a solid footing early by sending the
president to big-ticket fund-raising events.
   In Iowa, Tauke spokesman Allen Finch said the party wanted Bush
in the state early to raise money because Harkin will be able to
collect a sizable war chest.
   Iowa's GOP hierarchy turned out for the dinner _ Gov. Terry
Branstad, Sen. Charles Grassley, and the state's three other
Republican House members, Jim Leach, Lightfoot and Fred Grandy.
   Before the dinner at the Des Moines Convention Center, Bush
joined Tauke on a call-in radio show for 15 minutes at station WHO.
   In Colorado, Bush talked about the environment, holding down
taxes, farm policy and international relations as he plugged
Brown's candidacy.
   ``Hank Brown is what you need and is what this administration
needs _ a senator to make Colorado strong, to make this nation
proud, and a leader in the Senate that I can work with as president
of the United States.''
   Also Friday, Bush, with drug policy director William Bennett at
his side, delivered an anti-drug speech to an enthusiastic
auditorium of students at John F. Kennedy High School in Denver.
   Bush told the young people that if they have ideas on how to
solve the drug problem they should let their schools and their
government know about them.

   When Denver Symphony musicians dumped their board
of directors and rechristened themselves the Colorado Symphony, in
partnership with a local rock impressario, skeptics predicted
disaster. It hasn't happened.
   While things are far from rosy for the 53 musicians, they have
arranged a concert season with guest conductors and soloists and
launched a catchy advertising campaign that seems to be attracting
larger audiences.
   The money isn't great _ but who joins an orchestra to get rich?
And what's most important, said violinist Gary Goble, ``We are
still a very good orchestra.''
   ``I think we know we still have hurdles. Sure, it's still going
to be lean for the orchestra,'' said violist Lee Yeingst, a member
of the new musician-run orchestra's board. ``(But) we really now
have got our feet under us.''
   The Colorado Symphony Orchestra arose from the ashes of the
Denver Symphony Orchestra, which had accumulated debts of $2.5
million and owed $700,000 in unpaid rent to the city of Denver.
   The Denver symphony's troubles are far from unique _ orchestras
in Oakland and San Diego, Calif.; New Orleans; Nashville, Tenn.;
Detroit; and Newark, N.J., to name a few, have suffered financial
worries recently.
   In the last two years, the Denver musicians' pay was cut, the
concert season scaled back. But this fall, when the board proposed
a 1989-1990 season of just 11 weeks paying $530 a week _ down from
$670 a week for 41 weeks the year before _ musicians decided to
begin their own orchestra.
   ``It's unique,'' said Yeingst. ``You don't find an orchestra
where the musicians accept the responsibility not only for the
music-making but the actual operation.''
   Yeingst said the CSO is paying musicians a base salary of
$22,000 for a 26-week season. ``If the gate is larger, they'll make
more; if it's smaller, they'll make less,'' he said. ``Nothing is
guaranteed, just like real life.''
   Rock promoter Barry Fey, who is helping to produce and bankroll
the new orchestra, is more accustomed to booking acts such as the
Rolling Stones. He admitted in September that he had never attended
a symphony.
   Fey wants the orchestra off the society pages and onto
entertainment pages.
   ``There will be some highs and some lows along the road, but at
the end of the year, we'll be fine,'' Fey said.
   But Michael Maxwell, an administrator for the Denver Symphony,
which is going through bankruptcy reorganization, said he sees many
empty seats when he attends CSO concerts.
   ``Naturally we are concerned and disturbed (by the) very low
level of community support for those concerts,'' he said.
``Patronage has been very low. It cannot be economical for the
musicians.''
   Yeingst said musicians did not expect sold-out houses and
improved paychecks right away. But ``we have been more than meeting
expenses, and with any successful fund-raising, any kind of
support, we'll be fine,'' he said.
   Community support, however, is a problem. Yeingst said patrons
have grown resentful over the years with having to support an
organization in perpetual financial crisis.
   ``People now are simply not willing to write a check and let it
go at that. Those who are coming forward are interested to know
exactly where the money is going,'' he said. ``They want to know
about costs, budget.''
   The symphony's new fund-raising drive is aimed at the general
population, from whom it is soliciting donations of $18.12, after
Tchaikovsky's ``1812 Overture.''
   The season opened in November with a ``Symphony Sampler''
concert in McNichols Sports Arena that attracted nearly 12,000
people. But a few days later, when the classical series began at
Boettcher concert hall, only a few hundred showed up.
   ``But after finishing our fourth week things look a lot
better,'' Yeingst said. ``We're getting decent houses, and they
will improve. And we've had very favorable talks with the governor
and the mayor'' about support for the new orchestra.

   There was little surprise when federal

   City Federal Savings Bank in Bedminster, N.J., had been
recording increasingly large losses from real estate ventures in
New Jersey, Florida and Texas.
   Its third quarter results showed bad loans outweighing equity by
about nine times.
   Furthermore, the savings bank said last month that it would be
unable to meet new capital requirements that became effective
Thursday under the thrift bailout law signed last summer.
   ``It's not surprising,'' William McCrystal, an analyst with
Ryan, Beck and Co. in West Orange, N.J., who has been following the
institution's faltering performance, said Friday. ``They had an
extremely large amount of non-performing assets in excess of their
equity.''
   As of Sept. 30, City Federal had $747 million in non-performing
assets _ past-due loans and loans that don't pay interest _ and
only $89 million in equity, compared with $326.2 million at the end
of 1988.
   ``Under normal conditions, non-performing assets are no more
than 25 percent of equity,'' McCrystal said. ``With $89 million in
equity, their losses probably would have wiped out equity had the
feds not stepped in.''
   The thrift's dire straits prompted the Office of Thrift
Supervision in Washington to transfer control to the Resolution
Trust Corp., a federal agency created in August to dispose of
failed S&amp;Ls.
   ``City Federal was below all its capital requirements. It
doesn't look to us like they could recapitalize this institution
without federal assistance,'' said Bob Albanese, senior deputy
director of the Office of Thrift Supervision in New York.
   ``And the institution is continuing to experience operations
losses and loan losses,'' Albanese said.
   Bad commercial real estate and construction loans lie at the
heart of the thrift's troubles. Only recently, City Federal sold a
mortgage banking operation in Ohio, McCrystal said.
   City Federal was the lead lender in Port Liberte, a $750 million
luxury project planned for Jersey City, N.J., McCrystal said.
   ``They got very aggressive in the real estate market, but it
began to soften,'' he said.
   The thrift also was hurt by new rules that phase out by 1995 an
accounting break known as goodwill.
   City Federal was among several institutions in the early and
mid-1980s that bought ailing thrifts when regulators had no money
to deal with savings banks and were able to persuade institutions
such as City Federal to take over the thrifts in exchange for
goodwill. According to McCrystal, City Federal had $213 million in
goodwill on its books as of Sept. 30.
   Albanese said representatives of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, Resolution Trust Corp. and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. gathered at the savings bank's New Jersey offices
Friday.
   They replaced Chief Executive Officer John Atherton, other top
City Federal officers and the thrift's board of directors with a
government-selected managing agent and oversight team, but retained
some employees, Albanese said.
   City Federal Savings Bank officials did not return repeated
phone calls.
   According to RTC, which has taken control of 280 thrifts and
disposed of more than 30 nationwide, City Federal Savings Bank had
$9.8 billion in assets and $7.3 billion in 858,348 deposit accounts.
   RTC will help find a buyer for the institution, which maintained
105 retail branches in New Jersey and Florida that are considered a
valuable network. It also could decide to liquidate the thrift.
   ``For right now, it's business as usual,'' Albanese said.
   RTC will oversee a newly created federal mutual association,
known as City Savings Bank, which will continue handling
depositors' funds during normal business hours as a permanent
solution is negotiated.
   McCrystal said the corporation's stock had become worthless,
trading at just one-eighth Friday, but noted ``the significant loss
has been over the last year or two. This isn't going to wipe out
anybody.''
   Four other New Jersey thrifts already have been taken over by
federal regulators.
   McCrystal said the federal action was an indicator of things to
come now that Congress has clamped down on the floundering savings
industry.
   ``This says the government is going to follow through on the
legislation passed to do something about these large, troubled
thrifts.''

   Mickey Mouse used to whistle while he
worked back when he was Steamboat Willie, but he's got a more
strident tone as captain of the Queen Mary.
   The Walt Disney Co., which owns the leaseholds on the
permanently docked ocean liner and the adjacent Spruce Goose
exhibit in Long Beach Harbor, told all hands this week to conform
to Disney's 35-year-old dress code.
   The code deep-sixes beards, mustaches and long hair on men and
lowers the boom on bright eyeshadow, red fingernails or
``inappropriate'' makeup on women. The rules apply to 30,000
employees in Disney parks and resorts.
   James Magness, first officer on the Queen Mary, would sooner
ship out than shave off the mustache he grew 42 years ago and wore
in the Navy during the Korean War, aboard ships worldwide and
skippering motor yachts off Mexico.
   ``No,'' Magness said of removing the mustache, even if that
means he has to give up the ship, on which he has worked for 7{
years.
   ``They said a mustache `doesn't give a clean, fresh, wholesome
look,''' he said.
   Although Walt Disney himself sported a mustache, Disney Co.
apparently thinks hairy lips could sink its ship.
   ``The grooming standards were designed to fit into the entire
guest experience. We don't want to do anything that tends to
detract in any way from that experience,'' said Queen Mary
spokesman Rich Kerlin.
   The company bought the rights to the tourist attractions nearly
two years ago but only decided to put the code into effect in
preparation for an upcoming promotion.

   Washington state has an Elwha River, an Elwha
Ridge and now, thanks to the ferry Elwha, an Elwha Rock.
   The Washington Board on Geographic Names on Friday officially
named the reef in the San Juan Islands for the ferry, which rammed
it Oct. 2, 1983.
   Ferry Capt. Billy Fittro unwittingly romanced the stone when he
made an unauthorized detour into Grindstone Harbor on Orcas Island
while giving a local resident a waterside view of her home from the
Elwha's pilothouse.
   The ferry was damaged to the tune of $250,000, and local wits
came up with a tune of their own, ``Elwha on the Rocks.'' T-shirts
also carried Elwha slogans, and an island bar named a rum drink
after the incident. Fittro resigned and his boss, Capt. Nick Tracy,
was fired after he tried to run cover for Fittro.
   Islanders have for years called the reef Elwha Rock, and
Seattlite Greg Lange proposed to the board that it be named for the
boat that struck it. That's the way many rocks have gotten their
names, he said.
   Land Commissioner Brian Boyle, who heads the board, spoke in
favor of the name.
   ``There is a sense of whimsy attached to the name, but it will
serve as a significant warning to other people who travel in these
waters _ a stark reminder of what happened,'' Boyle said.
   The vote was 5 to 1, with dissenter Emmett Oliver grousing, ``I
don't understand how people could suggest to name something after
an incident that endangered people's lives.''

   A strong earthquake rocked eastern Japan early
today, but police said there had been no damage or casualties
reported.
   The quake, with a magnitude estimated at 5.4 on the Richter
scale, shook cities on the northeastern coast of Japan, the Central
Meteorological Agency reported. The agency said there was no danger
of tsunami, or tidal waves.
   The agency said the quake's epicenter was located 25 miles below
the sea 47 miles northeast off Mito, 60 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   Also today, an earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale was
reported about 470 miles east-southeast of the Philippine capital
of Manila. The Hong Kong Observatory said the quake struck Friday
evening. No further details were reported.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   A quake measuring 5 on the scale can cause considerable damage,
and a quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage.

<TEXT>
   The battle for the presidency
between a socialist labor leader and a conservative reformer has
widened divisions in a country already threatened with social and
economic chaos.
   Former Gov. Fernando Collor de Mello and socialist Luis Inacio
Lula da Silva are in the Dec. 17 runoff to become Brazil's first
directly elected president in 29 years. Neither won a majority in
the 21-candiate election on Nov. 15, when about 82 million
Brazilian cast their ballots.
   President Jose Sarney, barred by law from seeking re-election,
won a 1985 electoral college vote controlled by the military that
ruled Brazil from 1964-1985. Four economic plans introduced by
Sarney's government failed to halt inflation, which is at an annual
rate of 1,460 percent.
   Political anaylysts have expressed fear that the runoff election
will be a showdown between rich and poor. They say civilian rule,
reeling under an economic slump, the social impact of rapid
urbanization and a $110 billion foreign debt, may not be ready for
such a harsh test.
   ``This radical polarization is dangerous for Brazil, which now
must choose between two extremes that do not represent all
political options,'' said Rep. Fabio Feldman of the center-left
Social Democracy Party.
   Industrialists say a da Silva victory would accelerate the
flight of capital from the country.
   Labor leaders counter that if Collor de Mello leaves social
reforms to free-market forces the unrest could boil over.
   The prospect of a socialist victory disturbs Brazil's right-wing
military chiefs.
   ``We are now facing the dilemma of choosing between one man's
savior and another man's devil,'' said Jair Meneguelli, president
of the Central Workers' Union, a labor umbrella group.
   Collor de Mello, 40, a former governor of Alagoas state, founded
his National Reconstruction Party last February on a platform of
moral cleanup.
   He vowed to root out corruption and cronyism and blamed Sarney
so sharply for Brazil's economic ills the president ordered the
Justice Ministry to file suit for slander.
   Collor de Mello has publicly refused the support of ultraright
groups but they back him.
   Da Silva, a 44-year-old former lathe operator, calls for a
redistribution of land and wealth, increased worker control of
state monopolies and a moratorium on foreign debt payments.
   He is the leader of the Workers Party and is backed by Marxist
groups, labor unionists and the liberal wing of Brazil's Roman
Catholic Church. Da Silva built his power base in the industrial
belt around Sao Paulo and has broad support in the drought-ridden
northeast.
   Polls taken in early December gave Collor de Mello a 10-point
lead.
   Both candidates are trying to soften their images as they
campaign to win centrist support.
   The main targets are the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement
Party, which has the largest number of legislators in both houses
of Congress, and the Social Democracy Party.
   Both candidates must form alliances. Together their parties have
less than 6 percent of the seats in Congress, and the winner will
have to put together a broad congressional coalition to govern.
   Da Silva has been more successful than Collor de Mello in wooing
support. He has won limited endorsements from the Social Democracy
Party and from Leonel Brizola of the leftist Democratic Labor Party
who came in a close third behind da Silva in the November balloting.
   Rigidity in the Workers' Party could jeopardize a broader
leftist front, accoarding to some analysts.
   ``The Workers' Party is a one-class party. It will have to open
up more and become multi-class,'' wrote political scientist Helio
Jaguaribe.

<TEXT>
   The Hispanic community rallied around a
Colombian-born policeman convicted of killing two black men, but in
black neighborhoods where riots have followed racially tinged
trials in the past, all was calm.
   Two radio stations that cater to Colombians have scheduled
rallies today for Miami officer William Lozano, convicted Thursday
on two counts of manslaughter in the January deaths of Clement
Lloyd and Allan Blanchard.
   Lozano, who remains suspended from the force with full pay
pending a police department hearing, echoed feelings among Miami's
Hispanics that he was convicted in order to avoid further rioting
by Miami's blacks.
   ``I don't think it was fair,'' said Lozano, 31. You have to
realize (there have been) a lot of problems in the community in the
past. I was just being used as a scapegoat for this.''
   Lozano also said he knew the verdict would be guilty as soon as
the six-member jury entered the courtroom Thursday.
   ``Because when the jurors came out, everyone, every single
person from the jurors, they were looking down,'' he said. ``They
were sad, and you can read in their eyes that nobody wanted it. And
I knew, right there and then.''
   Three days of racial disturbances ensued in the Liberty City and
Overtown neighborhoods after the shooting of Lloyd, 23. Blanchard,
24, suffered fatal injuries in the crash of the motorcycle that
Lloyd was driving. The two were fleeing another group of police.
   Rioting also followed trials in the past where white officers
were acquitted in the slayings of blacks. But all was quiet Friday
in the black neighborhoods.
   Leaders of the black community praised Lozano's guilty verdict
as a victory for justice, but many Hispanics, including the
200,000-strong Colombian community, have said the officer was
shortchanged by racial politics.
   ``We are deeply hurt,'' Hernando Torres, executive secretary of
the Colombian American Political Action Committee, said Friday.
``We are convinced that officer Lozano was doing his duty defending
the community.''
   The two radio stations organizing the rally, WOCN-AM and
WKAT-AM, said they would seek money for Lozano's expected appeal
and signatures for a petition asking Dade Circuit Judge Joseph
Farina to show leniency in Lozano's Jan. 24 sentencing.
   On Friday, Jewish, Protestant and lay religious leaders held a
joint news conference and declared a weekend of prayer for the
shooting victims's families and for Lozano's family.
   ``Our prayers should be directed at preserving the unity of our
community within which the opinions are as diverse as our
population,'' said Rabbi Solomon Schiff, chairman of Dade County's
Community Relations Board. ``I think the worst thing we can do as a
community is to sit back smugly and say we came through this time
without fires and riots.''
   Lozano's family issued radio appeals earlier in the day for more
legal funds.
   ``We need money urgently,'' Lozano's brother Jairo, a Miami
police officer, told listeners on WKAT. ``I couldn't sleep all
night worrying about it.''
   ``It seems like things are better off here for a drug trafficker
than for a police officer _ maybe it would have been better for us
that way,'' he said.
   William Lozano's brother, Windsor, and his wife, Ana, also are
Miami police officers.

<TEXT>
   A deer hunter who shot to death a woman
last year in the woods behind her home has been indicted in a case
that has aroused strong feelings, pitting hunters against
non-hunters.
   A Penobscot County grand jury returned the indictment Friday
against Donald Rogerson. It was almost exactly a year after another
grand jury refused to indict Rogerson, finding neither criminal
negligence nor criminal recklessness in the Nov. 15, 1988 death of
Karen Wood, 37.
   Mrs. Wood's husband, Kevin, who has moved to Iowa with the
couple's twin daughters, who were a year old at the time of the
death, said he felt the grand jury had reached ``the only decision
logic and reason would allow.''
   Wood said the case should be viewed the same as any other
criminal proceeding, not as one that inflamed debate about hunting.
   Rogerson, a supermarket produce manager and an experienced
hunter, has said he believed he was firing at a deer. The case has
stirred strong emotions among hunters and non-hunters alike in this
rural state where deer season draws thousands into the woods each
autumn.
   In local newspaper opinion pages and elsewhere, discussion has
centered on how far from the Wood house Rogerson was when he shot
Mrs. Wood, and why Mrs. Wood was not wearing orange-colored
clothing, recommended for the woods during hunting season.
   No arraignment date has been set for Rogerson, who faces up to
20 years' imprisonment if convicted, said Assistant Attorney
General Jeffrey Hjelm.
   Chief Deputy Attorney General James T. Kilbreth said news
stories which raised questions about the fairness of the first
grand jury's decision prompted the state to present the case a
second time.
   A nephew of Rogerson's attorney, Lewis V. Vafiades, served on
the first grand jury, and Kilbreth said that was ``the most
important aspect'' of the decision to reopen the case. However, he
stressed there was only the appearance of a conflict and an
investigation by his office turned up no evidence of wrongdoing.
   Wood settled a wrongful death lawsuit against Rogerson in May
for $122,000.
   Vafiades described Rogerson as ``disappointed, obviously'' at
Friday's grand jury action.

   Alvin Ailey was remembered for his vision,
spirit and spice at a funeral service with dance and music that
alternately mourned his passing and exuberantly celebrated his
legacy to modern choreography.
   ``He made us believe we could fly,'' Judith Jamison, a former
lead dancer in Ailey's company, told hundreds who gathered Friday
in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan.
   Jamison, now a choreographer, called Ailey's life ``a poem
without words, in an improvised meter.''
   Ailey, whose company performed for millions in 45 countries,
died Dec. 1 at 58 of a rare blood disorder.
   The funeral service included somber organ music and
African-tinged drumming, five dances by members of Ailey's company
and a song by Nicholas Ashford and Valerie Simpson.
   Attending the service were scores of current and former members
of the company, which under Ailey's direction blended African,
Caribbean and gospel elements with jazz, modern dance and ballet.
   In a statement read to the gathering, President Bush said
Ailey's ``dedication to dance was singular and compelling.''
   ``Alvin was not only a pioneer in choreography but also a
teacher, a man committed to weaving his African-American heritage
into our nation's cultural tapestry,'' Bush said.
   Mayor-elect David Dinkins called Ailey ``an apostle of American
culture for the rest of the world.''
   ``Though he has left us, we all stand immeasurably enriched by
his brief time among us,'' Dinkins said.
   Before the service, current and former members of the troupe
gathered in the cathedral basement to reminisce.
   ``He made dance accessible to everyone,'' said Keith McDaniel,
who danced with the company for eight years. ``You didn't have to
have a trained eye or read a book _ all you had to do was open your
heart. That's what Alvin was all about, that spark of spirit.''
   Nat Orr, who danced with Ailey for five years, praised his
``ability to pull people's spirit out, getting people to
communicate. His influence is going to be felt for many, many
years.''
   ``Alvin was a spicy character, full of life, and a great
mentor,'' said Hector Mercado, another former dancer. ``He had a
wild sense of humor, and he could be a pain in the neck. He had
visions that, when you're young, you didn't see. But now we realize
it.''
   Babette Coffey-Fisch, a former dancer, said Ailey's art wasn't
just for black dancers _ ``It was for anyone who had a soul, anyone
who could express their spirit through movement.''

   U.S. servicemen at Clark Air Base
are roaming nearby streets and bars after their superiors lifted an
order confining them to their quarters during an attempted coup by
mutinous Philippine soldiers.
   ``Everybody is still real friendly'' toward the GIs, a senior
airman from Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, said today at the front gate of
the sprawling base, 50 miles north of Manila.
   F-4 Phantom jets from Clark flew air cover Dec. 1 for loyalist
forces at the request of President Corazon Aquino, helping to
thwart the revolt. The jets did not fire on the rebels but
prevented them from continuing air strikes on the presidential
palace and military camps in Manila.
   Clark servicemen said they were restricted to the base or their
off-base residences from Dec. 1 until Thursday and security was
tightened. Troops also were told not to talk to reporters.
   A sergeant from Wisconsin, who refused to identify himself
further, said the general feeling on the base after the flights
was, ``Oh oh, now for the first time we're actually involved.
What's going to happen? What retribution is going to happen?''
   Concern was not restricted to what the mutinous soldiers might
do in response to the U.S. action. Soldiers said there also was
concern about the Communist rebels active in the region, who are
believed responsible for at least five slayings of American GIs in
recent years.
   But when travel off the base was resumed, the airmen rushed for
the gates to the streets of Angeles, a city of dank honky-tonk bars
and restaurants that cater largely to the U.S. community of 10,000
active servicemen and about 16,000 dependants. The main strip
features McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Shakey's
restaurants.
   ``When I heard at 20 minutes after 3 o'clock I could go off
base, I was downtown by 4,'' said the sergeant.
   ``It was nice just to get out of the room again,'' said the
Idaho airman, who also refused to give his name.
   Several soldiers in shorts and T-shirts strolled off the base
this morning, shooing away vendors selling sunglasses or catching
rides into town. One GI hurrying from the base was dressed in full
baseball uniform with glove tucked under his arm.
   Angeles had been a ghost town during the days airmen were
restricted to quarters, with many businesses shut down completely.
An Australian bar owner said his business was down at least 60
percent.
   ``I would say it had a very big effect on the working girls'' in
the bars, said Mick O'Brien, owner of Moon Doggies, across the
street from the base. He said prostitutes were particularly hard
hit because the Christmas season traditionally is when they need
money to send to their families in the provinces.
   In October 1987, the economy of this city in central Luzon was
devastated after troops were confined to barracks following the
killings of three Americans by Communist rebels.
   Josie Navarro, ``mama-san,'' or madam, at the Bombay Court down
the street, also complained that business was ``so bad since Dec.
1. We had no GI customers.''
   But Friday night, the bar was again filled with U.S. servicemen
drinking San Miguel beer and shooting pool on the Bombay's two
faded billiard tables.
   ``We still like Americans,'' the mama-san said, leaning across
the bar for emphasis. ``We don't want the business to go away.''

   Nissan Motor Corp., which has been sued by
a family claiming the company spied on them, said it was only
practicing the American way of product research.
   Maritza and Stephen French claim fraud, invasion of privacy,
trespassing and unfair business practices by Nissan and Takashi
Morimoto, a Japanese Nissan employee who rented a room in their
Costa Mesa home last summer.
   ``They feel violated, they really do,'' said the Frenches'
attorney Nancy Kaufman. ``They just wonder what he was writing
down, what about their private lives is in a Nissan file
somewhere.''
   Nissan denied the couple's claims in a statement Friday from its
U.S. headquarters in Carson.
   ``Nissan is in the business of building cars,'' the company
said. ``We try to build cars that meet the needs of Americans by
studying the way Americans drive and buy their automobiles.
   ``That the media, the courts and our legal system are being tied
up because Mr. Morimoto did research on how we buy and use cars is
a truly regrettable situation.''
   Nissan said Morimoto, 29, was frank about the fact that he was a
Nissan employee ``and that he was in the U.S. to better understand
U.S. lifestyles and attitudes about cars.''
   Nissan said that not only was Morimoto not secretive, ``he was
plainly seen in the neighborhood photographing various cars, homes
and garages.''
   Ms. Kaufman said the family was aware that Morimoto worked for
Nissan but thought he had been temporarily assigned to the
company's U.S. headquarters in Carson.
   The company's statement said, ``the saddest element'' of the
litigation was ``that our judicial system would even allow (the
lawsuit) to be filed.''
   The lawsuit seeking unspecified damages was filed Thursday in
Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana. It seeks a court order
barring Nissan from placing alleged corporate emissaries into homes
of other unsuspecting families.
   Morimoto stayed with the Frenches from June 16 to July 31 after
the family answered an ad asking American families to sponsor
Japanese exchange students. The placement services said no students
were available when the Frenches inquired and the services
suggested Morimoto.
   While the family says it learned of Morimoto's role from an Oct.
2 Los Angeles Times article on car culture, Nissan said the article
``was actually sent to the French family by Nissan because we
thought they would enjoy it.''

single extortion charge nine weeks ago _ with the promise of
probation for their sentence.
   Today they face more than 50 years in prison.
   U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry refused to accept the
plea, saying it would violate her conscience in light of the
charges' seriousness, and the case went to trial. A federal jury
Friday convicted Thomas Gilsenan and Ralph Cicalese of conspiracy,
racketeering, extortion and drug charges.
   The government said the Essex County investigators protected a
drug dealer in exchange for cocaine, cash and valuables.
   The jury largely accepted the word of the man the investigators
protected: convicted drug-dealer and admitted murderer Robert
Vidal. Vidal was the bulwark of the government's case.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the case was difficult,
and authorities felt they had less than a 50 percent chance of
victory at the trial's outset.
   ``It's always difficult to convict law enforcement officers of
corruption,'' he said.
   Alito added that the verdict opened new ``avenues'' for
investigation, and the probe into law enforcement corruption in
Newark would continue. He would not elaborate.
   The defendants showed no reaction when the verdict was
announced. From the section where family and friends were sitting,
sharp gasps could be heard.
   ``The word disappointment doesn't do justice to this,'' said
Gilsenan's attorney, David Ruhnke. He and Michael Critchley,
Cicalese's lawyer, promised appeals.
   Gilsenan, 42, of Verona was a detective in the Essex County
prosecutor's office since 1971. Cicalese, 36, of West Orange is a
former Newark police officer and worked in the investigator's
office since 1984. Both were suspended after the indictment.
   Barry set sentencing for Feb. 14. They face more than 50 years
in prison terms.
   Gilsenan and Cicalese were each found guilty of racketeering
conspiracy, racketeering and drug and extortion conspiracy.
   Gilsenan was also convicted of nine individual extortion, drug
and obstruction of justice counts and acquitted of 11 other counts.
Cicalese was found guilty of 11 individual extortion and drug
counts and was acquitted of six others. The crimes were committed
between 1984 and 1986.
   McCarthy said that the two investigators tipped off Vidal about
a police informer in his organization, told him of wiretaps and
protected him from arrest. In exchange, he said Cicalese received
mainly cocaine and Gilsenan got cash, appliances, a car, suits and
jewelry.

   Saving the Earth is not such a difficult thing.
   For instance, if Americans recycled all their Sunday newspapers
it would save more than 500,000 trees a week.
   And with the junk mail Americans get each day _ 44 percent of
which is never opened _ they could produce enough energy to heat
250,000 homes.
   Just pumping up tires to the right pressure would save about 2
billion gallons of gasoline a year.
   These and other practical points are listed in a book offered at
the Earth Expo and Earth Action Conference, which opened Friday at
the Georgia World Congress Center and is aimed at offering tips to
individuals on conserving earthly resources.
   It is the first of a series of fairs planned for seven cities.
   ``Most people believe that the problem is so overwhelming that
no one person can do anything,'' said John Javna of Earth Works
Press in Berkeley, Calif. ``That's simply not true.''
   His book, ``50 Simple Things You Can Do To Save the Earth,''
appeared Nov. 1 and already has sold more than 100,000 copies.
   Javna and his book are crammed with ``pop facts,'' some of them
downright scary. (For instance, Javna says there are more
artificial chemicals in the average American home today than there
were in the average chemical laboratory 100 years ago).
   There are suggestions, too: Mothballs are made from 100 percent
paradichlorobenzene, harmful to the liver and kidneys.
Alternatives: Cedar chips or cedar oil work just fine.
   Another fair participant, pharmacist Stanley Meyerson of
Syracuse, N.Y., has developed the National Ecological and
Environmental Delivery System, specializing in products for people
sensitive to the increasing number of chemicals in the home and
elsewhere.
   ``This is the first generation to be exposed so totally to
chemical products _ chemicals, dyes, preservatives, contaminants in
the water,'' he said.
   His company markets water-based paints and dyes, water and air
filters and biodegradable products such as soaps, adhesives and
cleaners.
   Show coordinator Zenia Richler, who researched the applicants
and pared the list to about 68 based on credibility, said many of
the new products, such as biodegradable cellulose bags that
resemble plastic but are made from plant fiber, still are more
expensive than their synthetic counterparts because they aren't yet
mass-produced.
   The biodegradable plastics also raise environmental concerns.
For one, the material breaks down into plastic particles that may
contain toxic metals such as cadmium and lead. For another,
recycling centers are refusing degradable plastics because they are
not as strong as plastics don't degrade, thus contaminating the
recyclable mix.
   The fair also includes displays for reusable diapers that have
the convenience of disposables, herbal skin creams, insulation that
does not use fiberglass and an attractive bench made completely of
recycled plastics.
   For a fee Watercheck, of Cleveland, Ohio, will check your tap
water for over 90 contaminants and send you a printout of the
results. If your water flunks, Watercheck recommends seeing a
qualified water treatment specialist.
   Entrepreneurs say the problem of impure water is getting worse
as more and more dangerous chemicals go into landfill dumps and
find their way back into the water system.
   ``The water systems can't keep up with the chemicals that are
going into them,'' Ms. Richler said.

   Ronald Reagan says he enjoys everything about
Christmas, especially his new freedom as a shopper.
   The former president strolled the Century City Mall on a
shopping excursion on Friday, buying stuffed toys for
underprivileged children and even a few treats for himself.
   Startled shoppers along the poinsettia-lined open-air mall broke
out in wide smiles at the sight of Reagan meandering down the
concourse. Some waved. Reagan stopped to shake hands, nuzzle
infants and sign autographs.
   With his half-dozen Secret Service agents leading the way, he
journeyed to a candy store to buy a 5-pound box of chocolates for
the White House switchboard operators. There was a 9-inch chocolate
Santa for Nancy, too.
   ``I'm sure she'll like this better than the diamond bracelet,''
he said.
   Reagan was next off to his favorite store _ Blue Chip Cookies.
Asked if the $9.75 worth of chocolate chip cookies were for him, he
said, ``Yep, mainly me.''
   ``I like everything about Christmas,'' Reagan said when asked if
he enjoyed shopping after eight years of security-minded
limitations. ``There were a lot of restrictions before.''
   The 78-year-old Reagan began his noontime sojourn with a corn
chowder lunch at the 1950s-style malt shop. He then moved down the
mall and stopped in a store to buy three golf balls and stuffed
Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and Winnie the Pooh.
   ``It's just a mission for the kids,'' Reagan said. ``There are
programs that are seeing that tots get toys who otherwise might not
get them. Mine here are two for the Marines and one for the Highway
Patrol.
   ``And I thought it wouldn't hurt if I bought those three golf
balls for myself.''

<TEXT>
   James D. Squires has resigned after eight years
as editor of the Chicago Tribune, where he was credited with luring
two nationally syndicated columnists from a rival paper.
   Jack Fuller, the newspaper's executive editor, will replace
Squires as vice president and editor effective Dec. 31, said John
W. Madigan, president and chief executive officer of the Tribune,
in a statement Friday.
   Squires, in a statement, did not refer to any future plans. He
was not available for comment Friday.
   ``My decision was made for two reasons: To ease and expedite the
transition to a new era of leadership, begun this time last year
with the appointment of a new president _ and to placate my own
restless heart,'' he wrote in a memo to newspaper employees.
   ``Under Jim Squires' leadership, the Chicago Tribune has
flourished, winning several Pulitzer Prizes and many other
awards,'' Madigan said in the statement.
   ``His leadership has played a role in the overall success of the
Tribune Company,'' Madigan said. ``We wish Jim well in his future
endeavors.''
   The New York Times, quoting staff members who asked not to be
identified, said that Squires and Madigan, an investment banker
before he joined the Tribune Company in 1975, had a
long-established antagonism and that no one was surprised they
would not want to work together. Madigan became president of the
company in January.
   Squires joined the Tribune Co. in 1972 as head of the Tribune's
Washington bureau. In 1977, he became editor of the Orlando
Sentinel.
   When he became editor of the Tribune in 1981, he issued a
standing invitation to columnists Mike Royko and Ann Landers, both
working at the rival Chicago Sun-Times at the time.
   Royko went across the street to the Trib in 1984, citing media
magnate Rupert Murdoch's purchase of the Sun-Times. Murdoch no
longer owns the paper.
   Miss Landers accepted in 1987, saying it was time for a change.
   Fuller has been executive editor of the Tribune since 1987.
   He joined the newpaper in 1973, resigned to serve as a special
assistant to the U.S attorney general in 1975-76 but rejoined the
newspaper in 1977. He won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing in
1986.
   The Tribune is Chicago's biggest newspaper, with a circulation
of 720,150 on weekdays and 1,123,000 for Sunday editions.
   The Tribune Co. owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team; the Quebec
&amp; Ontario Paper Co. in Canada; the New York Daily News, The Orlando
(Fla.) Sentinel, the Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) News, and the Newport
News-Hampton (Va.) Daily Press@Times-Herald.
   Tribune Entertainment Co. operates Radio WGN, WGN-TV (Chicago),
KWGN-TV (Denver), Radio WGNR-AM, KCTC-FM (Sacramento, Calif.),

<HEAD>Search Continues For Missing Crewmen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescue ships fought raging winds and
towering waves early today in search of survivors from two cargo
ships that sank in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
   There was no sign of 39 crew members from the ships, which sank
about 125 miles apart. Search and rescue efforts were hampered by
high winds, heavy seas, bitter cold, snow and poor visibility.
   ``As the hours wear on the possibilies of survival become much
decreased,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Dick Pepper.
   Coast Guard officials said the 400-foot Capitaine Torres and
270-foot Johanna B disappeared Thursday night in rough seas about
120 miles apart and north of Cape Breton.
   It said all of the 23 crewmen aboard the Capitaine Torres and 16
on the Johanna B were foreigners, including many Filipinos.
   On Friday, searchers said they came within sight of some of the
seaman aboard the Capitaine Torres, which foundered about 40 miles
north of Cape Breton.
   Pepper said the captain of the Canadian Coast Guard cutter Sir
Wilfred Grenfell spotted survivors on a life raft.
   ``He saw them waving,'' said Pepper. ``He couldn't get to them
right away ... as he was maneuvering the ship he saw two very high
breakers hit the raft itself, sweep through it. By the time he got
back around and recovered the raft there were no personnel on it.''
   The Grenfell spotted several life jackets, the wreckage of a
wooden life raft and two empty rubber rafts. The fourth life raft
on the ship was not accounted for on Friday night.
   The Capitaine Torres was crewed by French, Fijian, Dutch and
Filipino men as well as sailors from the small South Pacific
republic of Vanuatu, where the ship is registered.
   The Capitaine Torres had sent a distress call saying the cargo
had shifted, some of it tumbling over overboard, causing it to list
badly. The ship said the crew was abandoning ship in enclosed
rubber rafts about 36 miles north of Cape Breton.
   The Capitaine Torres was carrying general container cargo from
Portage, Ind., to Taiwan. A cargo container _ the size of a boxcar
_ can weigh several tons when fully loaded.
   The Johanna B was carrying pig iron when it radioed for help.
The ship was destined for Darrow, La., near New Orleans.
   Passing commercial ships continued this morning to join the
search by matching their courses with coordinates set by the search
and rescue center, and keeping a lookout, said a rescue official.
   Some crew aboard the Grenfell and other Coast Guard ships
returned to work in spite of a month-old strike by civilian crew
members of federal government ships, including coast guard and
fisheries vessels.

<HEAD>25 Children Injured in Subway Escalator Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A child's clothing became ensnared in an
escalator at a subway station, causing an emergency stop that sent
screaming children tumbling backward, police said. At least 25
children were injured, none seriously.
   About 60 fourth and fifth graders were riding the escalator
Friday at a subway station in midtown Manhattan on their way back
from a trip to see the giant Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center,
officials said.
   A child's clothing became snagged at the top of the escalator,
said transit police spokesman Al O'Leary.
   ``The kids began stacking up and someone, possibly two people,
hit an emergency stop button,'' O'Leary said, attributing the
report to an officer at the scene.
   A homeless man who saw the accident was credited with pulling
some of the children to safety.
   ``I was scared,'' said one of the children, 9-year-old Theresa
Narvaez. ``I thought I would slip into the bottom of the escalator.
I was afraid I was going to be eaten up.''
   O'Leary said it wasn't clear who may have pushed the stop
button, adding it could have been one of the teachers who
accompanied the students.
   ``Pandemonium, in short,'' said transit officer Sgt. James
Capaldo. ``They were all crying, upset and confused.''
   A spokesman at Bellevue Medical Center, Jim Walsh, said one
child may have broken an ankle. Another had a possible broken leg.
Ten other children were treated at the hospital for bumps and
bruises. All were between the ages of 9 and 11, he said.
   Other children were taken to hospitals after complaining about
injuries once they returned to school, increasing the number of
injured beyond 25, police said. No other serious injuries were
reported.

   A storm that lingered today and dumped several inches of snow on
the Washington, D.C., area could be only the beginning, a National
Weather Service forecaster in Washington said.
   ``Right now, we're looking at a potential storm for Monday and
another for Wednesday in the East,'' said Jim Belville,
meteorologist in charge of the weather service's Washington office.
``We could end up with a one-two punch along the East Coast.''
   Up to a foot of snow _ and 15 inches in the mountains _ had been
forecast for much of central Virginia, with the snow continuing
today. But the weather service canceled a winter storm warning for
all but the interior southeast and central Tidewater regions late
Friday night.
   ``For all practical purposes, it's over,'' said meteorologist
Hurtis Smith of the weather service in Richmond.
   At 3 p.m. EST Friday, snow accumulation around the nation's
capital included 5 inches at Salisbury, 4 inches at Dulles and 3
inches at Baltimore and Patuxent River.
   Conditions were expected to improve in the region today, with
high temperatures in the upper 30s, climbing into the 40s Sunday
and Monday.
   Virginia snowfall ranged from 1 inch in Newport News to 9 inches
in Staunton. Smith said no further accumulations were expected.
   Parts of West Virginia were covered with up to 6 inches of snow.
The storm was expected to drop 8 inches on Maryland's Eastern Shore
before it played out.
   Snowfall in western Pennsylvania included 5 inches at Mount
Morris and Ohiopyle.
   Winter storm warnings for early today were posted over eastern
Kentucky, northeast Tennessee and the mountains of northern North
Carolina.
   Snow advisories were in effect over the Cascades of Washington
and Oregon and the mountains of Tennessee.
   On Friday, winds gusted to 59 mph at Casper, Wyo.
   More than three inches of rain soaked Apalachicola, Fla.,
between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m. Friday.
   The cities of Houghton Lake, Mich., Portland, Maine, and

<HEAD>Mass Murderer Was a Crack Shot, Best Friend Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who killed 14 women at the University of
Montreal engineering school was a crack shot who used to shoot
pigeons as they flew, said a childhood friend.
   Marc Lepine, whose rampage Wednesday at the university's
engineering school ended when he shot himself, was an electronics
buff who dreamed of being an engineer, said friend Jean Belanger.
   But he really exceled in hunting, said Belanger, 24, recalling
how they used to hunt pigeons together as teen-agers with BB guns.
   ``He was good at it _ better than me. He saw a pigeon flying and
he used to be able to shoot it while it was flying ... not every
time, but most of the time,'' Belanger said Friday.
   Lepine likely learned to shoot from an uncle who had trained
with the U.S. Green Berets and had been a Canadian Forces
paratrooper, a source close to the family said Friday.
   ``Apparently the way he used the rifle there wasn't one lost
shot,'' the source said, adding that Lepine often visited the uncle
on his sheep farm after his parents broke up.
   On Wednesday, Lepine, carrying a semi-automatic hunting rifle,
used only 35 to 37 bullets to kill the 14 and wound 13 people,
killing most of the women with shots to the head. A three-page
letter blaming women for his failures in life was found beside his
body.
   Lepine grew up with a brutal father who had a total disdain for
women and believed they were intended only to serve men, his mother
told a 1976 divorce hearing.
   The couple stopped living together in 1971, when Marc was 7
years old, and a divorce was finally granted in 1978.
   The marriage so scarred Monique Lepine, her son, Marc, and her
daughter, Nadia, that they spent a year in psychotherapy. ``We had
difficulties expressing love,'' Ms. Lepine told her divorce hearing.
   Belanger agreed.
   ``I always tried to get Marc to get himself a girlfriend, to
find out what girls were all about, but he had a lot of problems
with that,'' Belanger said. ``It's not that he wasn't interested.''
   He described his friend, with whom he lost touch when Lepine
moved to another part of Montreal in his late teens, as fascinated
with electronics.
   ``His ideal was to be an electronics engineer or a computer
engineer _ he was interested in both,'' he said.
   Police said Lepine, 25, an unemployed hospital worker, wanted to
go the engineering school where he went on his rampage but there is
no evidence he applied for admission.

<HEAD>Plaintiff in Prominent Abortion Case Reunited With Last Missing Child</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: CORRECTS name in court papers to Doe from Roe in lead and 3rd
graf; picks up 4th grav pvs, `Mrs. Cano's...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY L. CARTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1973, a woman known in court papers as Mary
Doe won the right to an abortion, in a landmark U.S. Supreme Court
ruling released the same day as the more famous Roe vs. Wade case.
   By then the woman had decided against the abortion and given the
baby girl up for adoption; she had also lost custody of two earlier
children.
   Today Mary Doe _ whose real name is Sandra Cano _ is ending her
separation with the last of the three children, closing a process
of reunification that parallels the turnaround in her stance to an
anti-abortion position.
   Mrs. Cano's first daughter, April, 22, was flying to Atlanta
from Seattle today for their first meeting in 17 years, Mrs. Cano
said.
   Earlier this year, Mrs. Cano was reunited with her daughter
Melissa, whom she gave up for adoption in 1970 after deciding not
to go ahead with an abortion. She was reunited with her son, Joel,
12 years ago.
   Her desire for the abortion had thrust Mrs. Cano into the
history books as the anonymous plaintiff Mary Doe in the Doe vs.
Bolton case. The court's decision, which struck down Georgia's
restrictive anti-abortion law, was issued Jan. 22, 1973, the same
day the court struck down Texas' abortion law in Roe vs. Wade.
   The two older children, Joel and April, were taken from the
woman a year before that. She said she lost custody of the children
after a dispute with a baby sitter and ``because of me being young
and naive.''
   She launched a battle to regain custody of Joel and April from
the family they had been placed with and attained partial success
when she got the boy 12 years ago, when he was 11.
   Child welfare officials thought it best that April not rejoin
the family, Mrs. Cano said. She had managed to track the adoptive
parents to Columbus and then Denver, but hit a dead end eight years
ago.
   In November, a week after Thanksgiving, April called.
   Mrs. Cano said her daughter told her she had been trying to find
her mother since being abandoned by her adoptive family and placed
in a mental hospital at age 14. She said her adoptive father, who
refused to have anything to do with her, was the one who finally
told her to contact Georgia social services, leading her to her
birth mother.
   Mrs. Cano said April told her stories of abuse, confirming the
fears that had fueled her long search for the girl.
   After she identified herself publicly as the case's Mary Doe in
February, Mrs. Cano said, her car was shot at, two trucks were
stolen and graffiti was scrawled on another vehicle.
   Ironically, Mrs. Cano no longer holds a pro-choice stand.
   In fact, she said, now that her family is back together she
plans to increase her involvement in the anti-abortion movement,

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh assured Sri
Lankan officials that he wants improved ties with their government,
but Sri Lanka says India is illegally arming a paramilitary force
in the island nation.
   After Singh met with Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ranjan
Wijeratne on Friday, the two sides issued a statement saying ``the
whole spirit should be one of trust and of a joint endeavor.''
   Although Singh and Wijeratne stressed India would soon end its
2{-year military deployment in Sri Lanka, Wijeratne said a major
sticking point remained: India's alleged arming of a new Tamil
militia, whose existence has been outlawed by Sri Lanka's
government.
   Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Singh, Wijeratne
said: ``I made a complaint that the so-called Tamil National Army,
numbering about 4,000, had been trained and armed by the IPKF
(Indian peacekeeping force) without the authorization and knowledge
of the Sri Lankan government.''
   The joint communique said Singh had taken note of the concerns
and that a response would be conveyed ``after a full examination of
all issues.''
   The Sri Lankan government, as well as local residents, have
accused the departing Indian troops of providing automatic rifles,
mortars and rockets to the Tamil National Army.
   The Tamil National Army has attacked Moslems in areas already
vacated by Indians and has clashed with a rival Tamil militia in
other regions still patrolled by Indians, according to witnesses
and Sri Lankan officials.
   Both Singh and Wijeratne said they expected the Indian pullout
to be completed as previously agreed by the end of December.
   Wijeratne estimated about 25,000 Indian soldiers were still in
Sri Lanka, although other estimates place the number as high as
36,000.
   Singh, who took office Saturday, told reporters earlier:
``Having good relations with Sri Lanka is the first priority of the
present government.''
   Instead of playing its envisioned role as peacemaker and
supervising a docile surrender of arms by Tamil separatists, the
Indian troops bogged down in the jungle war since they entered Sri
Lanka following an Indian-Sri Lankan pact to end the Tamil
insurgency in 1987.
   At least 1,100 Indian soldiers were among the 17,000 people
killed in Sri Lanka's tangle of ethnic and political struggles
since 1983.
   About 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people are Tamils,
most of whom are Hindus. Sinhalese are mostly Buddhists and
comprise 75 percent of the population. Tamils complain they are
discriminated against in jobs and education.

<HEAD>Soviet Central Committee Meeting Opens Amid Speculation of Shakeups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior Communist Party officials met today amid
speculation about a leadership shake-up and growing calls for the
party to give up its domination of Soviet life.
   Rumors of leadership changes always precede meetings of the
party's policy-making Central Committee because it is the only body
empowered to make changes in the ruling Politburo.
   But the rumors were bolstered by Communist leaders' increasingly
embattled position as they struggle to keep the once-monolithic
party from losing its clout and breaking into factions.
   Challenges to the party's dominance came from independent-minded
Communists in outlying republics and prominent lawmakers who have
called for a brief strike Monday to force the issue.
   Lithuania on Thursday became the first republic in the Soviet
Union to drop a constitutional guarantee of Communist supremacy and
substitute a multi-party system.
   Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov and several other members
of the Soviet Parliament have urged a brief general strike Monday
to call on lawmakers to drop the constitution's Article 6, which
guarantees the party the ``leading and guiding role'' in society.
   Czechoslovakia and East Germany, scrambling to enact democratic
reforms to staunch huge anti-government rallies, have cut out
similar provisions from their constitutions.
   In Leningrad, an estimated 40,000 rank-and-file Communists
rallied this week to support President Mikhail S. Gorbachev against
what they said was a bid by conservatives to oust him.
   Officially, today's Communist Party meeting was to address only
questions on economic reform and party organization to prepare for
a meeting of the full Soviet Parliament three days later.
   A meeting of the Moscow city party on Friday indicated that if
the party also raised the issue of Article 6, it might show new
willingness to consider giving it up.
   Almost all the Moscow party leaders quoted in today's newspapers
said they were ready to see the article either canceled or altered.
   Even Moscow party chief Yuri A. Prokofiev agreed ``we are for
replacing this article of the U.S.S.R. constitution,'' but he also
condemned ``extremist forces'' for pushing the question in order to
hurt the party, Moskovskaya Pravda reported.
   Prokovfiev called Gorbachev's article last month on new ideas
about Communism and perestroika ``was so very necessary to the
party and society and was clearly late.'' He also criticized the
anti-alcohol campaign Gorbachev launched soon after coming to power
in 1985.
   Communist demonstrators at a rally in Leningrad aimed their own
shots at Gorbachev and the Politburo, furthering the impression of
a growing schism in the party. The Nov. 22 party-organized rally,
where some speakers and slogans accused Gorbachev of abandoning the
party and Communist ideology, elicited a counter-rally by
progressives Wednesday.
   Prior to the Wednesday protest, activists handed out leaflets
warning that Gorbachev and his closest allies in the Politburo,
Alexander Yakovlev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, could
lose their party jobs at today's Central Commmittee meeting, said
activist Gennady Bogomolov.
   The Central Committee's approximately 350 full and non-voting
members could remove Gorbachev from his post as party chief.
However, Gorbachev enjoys a measure of security, since he has
strengthened the power of the government and has been elected to a
five-year term as president.

<HEAD>State, EPA Sign Rocky Flats Cleanup Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDY SHORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A draft agreement that for the first time assigns
responsibilities for the cleanup of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons
plant has been signed by two governmental agencies overseeing the
contaminated complex.
   A third agency, the Department of Energy, put off signing the
document until next week because of a minor financial snag.
   The Environmental Protection Agency and the Colorado Department
of Health on Friday signed the document, a blueprint for carrying
out cleanup priorities agreed upon in principle by Gov. Roy Romer
and DOE Secretary James Watkins in June.
   Cleanup of contamination is estimated to cost $500 million to $1
billion and to take more than a decade, officials said.
   ``We can feel very comfortable that what we're signing here has
been agreed upon as an interagency agreement and just needs that
final OK, which we will assume will come early next week,'' EPA
regional administrator James J. Scherer said at a news conference.
   Dave Simonson of the DOE's Rocky Flats office said he expected
to sign the agreement early next week.
   ``I think it's a good agreement for all of us. It sets out what
will be done. It sets out the regulatory framework for
environmental work at Rocky Flats,'' Simonson said.
   The agreement, in draft form until it is finalized after a
60-day public comment period, coordinates state and federal
environmental laws to ensure the cleanup of waste at the plant 16
miles northwest of Denver. It also establishes, for the first time,
schedules for the study and cleanup of contaminated sites.
   ``What we have here is a step forward in this interagency
agreement that allows us to put a very strict group of schedules
and work plans together so that actual cleanup action ... can begin
almost immediately,'' Scherer said.
   Tom Looby, assistant state health department director, said the
agreement resolved a number of issues that have snagged the cleanup
of other federal facilities by integrating the responsibilities
under the federal Superfund Act and the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act.
   In addition, the agreement requires DOE to comply with state
hazardous waste laws, he said.
   ``I think that by virtue of this cooperative approach of
recognizing the state's environmental laws, we are in the position
of making sure we get the cleanup that's necessary,'' he said.
   The DOE plant manufactures triggers for nuclear weapons. In
June, the FBI raided the plant, looking for evidence of alleged
illegal hazardous waste handling. A federal grand jury is weighing
the case, but has not issued indictments.
   This fall, DOE replaced Rockwell International Corp. with EG&amp;G
Inc. as contractor at the plant. EG&amp;G is scheduled to take over in
January.
   Under the agreement, DOE will investigate the extent of
contamination at 178 sites on and off the plant site to evaluate
and prioritize cleanup activities.
   A 60-day comment period will begin Dec. 22 to give the public
time to offer opinions on the agreement.

<HEAD>Immigration Officials Want to Deport Salvadoran Hunger Striker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The immigration service has refused to grant
residency to a Salvadoran who has been living in the United States
for eight years and is currently on a hunger strike to protest U.S.
military aid to El Salvador.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service said Rene Hurtado was
involved in terrorism while in the Salvadoran military and should
not have received the temporary residency status granted him in
1987.
   The notification was mailed to Hurtado this week by James M.
Bailey of the INS's regional office in Lincoln, Neb. Bailey's
letter said the INS reconsidered Hurtado's case last spring when he
applied to upgrade his residency status from temporary to permanent.
   Hurtado was informed that he was ineligible for temporary or
permanent residency because ``you participated in killing, rape and
torture.''
   The INS cited newspaper accounts of Hurtado's interviews and
speeches as evidence of his past involvement in terrorism as a
member of the Treasury Police, one of the Salvadoran police
agencies now being supported by the U.S. government.
   Hurtado fled to the United States in 1981 after being discharged
from the Salvadoran military. He claims to have undergone a
spiritual conversion that led him to confess his actions and speak
out against abuses by the Salvadoran military. He has been under
the protection of a local church since 1982.
   Hurtado has never denied that he was involved in acts of
brutality but claims he never killed anyone. Hurtado is an assumed
name used by the man to avoid reprisals against relatives still
living in El Salvador.
   Hurtado and others are in their third week of a hunger strike at
the St. Paul Cathedral. He was resting Friday and unavailable for
an interview, church officials said.
   ``We find it more than coincidental that the INS is taking this
action at this time,'' said Nancy Berneking, a member of St. Luke's
Presbyterian Church in suburban Wayzata, which shelters Hurtado.
She said a letter-writing campaign had been started to protect him.
   Ron Rosenbaum, one of Hurtado's attorneys, agreed. He said the
INS had spent six months investigating Hurtado's background before
he was granted temporary residency status on Dec. 16, 1987.
   ``And now they do this, two years after (granting residency
status) and at a time when El Salvador, and Rene, are back in the
news,'' Rosenbaum said.
   Thomas Schiltgen, acting director of the INS office in the Twin
Cities, said ``it was our position all along that (Hurtado) wasn't
eligible.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   At least six people died in weather-related accidents when a
pre-winter storm dumped up to 9 inches of snow and sleet on
Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina.
   The National Weather Service had forecast up to a foot of snow
throughout much of central Virginia, and up to 15 inches in the
mountains, but less than that had fallen before the service
canceled its winter storm warning for most of the state late Friday
night.
   ``For all practical purposes, it's over,'' said meteorologist
Hurtis Smith of the weather service in Richmond.
   Two men died on a state highway in central North Carolina in a
collision blamed on a slick spot on the highway. On Virginia
highways, four people including a 3-year-old boy died in separate
accidents Friday.
   Snowfall ranged from 1 inch in Newport News to 9 inches in
Staunton. The storm closed schools and sent office workers home
early around Virginia.
   Ronnie Fink of the Virginia Department of Transportation said no
highways were closed, ``but we have many, many miles that are
treacherous.''
   The storm left parts of West Virginia covered by up to 6 inches
of snow, and was expected to drop 8 inches on Maryland's Eastern
Shore before it played out today. Washington, D.C., was dusted with
a few inches of snow that led the federal government to close some
offices early.
   Airline officials reported some delays out of airports in
Washington and Baltimore. American Airlines canceled its arriving
and departing flights from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport
after 6 p.m., according to airport spokeswoman Teresa Damiano,
although the airport remained open.
   The National Weather Service was predicting more storms next
week.
   ``Right now, we're looking at a potential storm for Monday and
another for Wednesday in the East,'' said Jim Belville,
meteorologist in charge of the weather service's Washington office.
``We could end up with a one-two punch along the East Coast.''
   ``The eastern part of the U.S. has had an abnormal amount of
severe storms this year,'' Belville said.

<HEAD>Boeing Forming Division for New Widebody Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing plans to build a new wide-body jetliner
called the 777 even though it has no orders from airlines.
   The 350-passenger twin-engine jet, seating 10 people across,
will be designed to compete with McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s MD-11
and the Airbus Industries A-330. It would be larger than the Boeing
767 but smaller than the 747 jumbo jet.
   Boeing officials on Friday estimated a $100 billion market for
the new plane, which initially would be marketed to replace aging
transcontinental carriers.
   It is the first Boeing jet totally designed by computer. It may
be built in partnership with three Japanese aerospace companies.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Dean Thornton said he was
creating a new division to develop and market the plane Boeing now
calls the 767-X. If the plane enters production, it will be called
the 777.
   Boeing hopes to offer the new plane by 1995, if enough airline
interest is shown, Thornton said. The last new model number Boeing
introduced was the 757, which entered service in 1983, although the
long-range 747-400, which began deliveries early this year, is
essentially a new aircraft.
   Thornton said Boeing is far from committed to actually building
the aircraf. But he said seven or eight carriers had expressed
strong interest, and another dozen were interested to a lesser
degree.
   Boeing, the world's largest commercial jet builder, had record
profits in its most recent quarter and has a backlog of more than
1,700 firm jet orders, with deliveries stretching into the next
century.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attacks by leftist guerrillas
cut power supplies in San Salvador and left a city hall in flames
south of the capital.
   In another development Friday, a judge ordered that American
Jennifer Casolo and seven Salvadorans remain jailed for 90 days
while an investigation continues into their possible links to a
cache of ammunition and explosives.
   The capital's power supply was cut by half and electricity was
being rationed to industrial users Friday after the rebels
dynamited eight main power lines, the national power company said.
   The Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Co. said rebel sabotage had caused
severe service disruptions in Sal Salvador and elsewhere.
   Rebels often blow down power lines and pylons as part of a
10-year-old civil war in which more than 71,000 people have been
killed.
   A statement from the army press office said rebels attacked
government forces early Friday in Chalatenango province, 55 miles
north San Salvador. It said 17 guerrillas and one soldier were
killed.
   Rebels also set fire to the city hall, telephone office and a
gasoline station in El Transito, 75 miles southeast of the capital,
but no casualties were reported, the army said.
   Friday's fighting was the lightest since guerrillas began an
offensive Nov. 11 aimed primarily at San Salvador. More than 1,000
soldiers, rebels and civilians have been killed in the offensive.
   The legislature of the U.S.-supported government on Friday
extended for another 30 days a state-of-siege approved after the
offensive began. The emergency, imposed Nov. 12 for 30 days,
suspends constitutional guarantees.
   The court order Friday extended the detention of Jennifer
Casolo, a 28-year-old native of Thomaston, Conn., who was arrested
Nov. 25 when police found more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition
along with explosives and detonator caps buried in the backyard of
the home she rented.
   She and the other Salvadorans, one of whom is still at large,
have been charged with terrorism, criminal and subversive
association and possession of weapons of war, court secretary David
Romero said.
   Judge Guillermo Romero Hernandez of the 1st Military Court
ordered the prisoners held for 90 days during which the defense and
prosecution collect and present evidence. The judge then decides if
there is sufficient evidence to order a public trial. No bond was
set for the defendants.
   Ms. Casolo, who has represented the Texas-based Christian
Educational Seminars in El Salvador for nearly five years, says she
rented the house three months ago, traveled much of the time, and
knew nothing about hidden munitions.

   East Germany's Communists gave in to the
forces of reform today and elected Gregor Gysi, a lawyer for the
pro-democracy opposition, as their new leader.
   Gysi said the Communists now consider themselves one political
force among several in planned elections that will determine the
country's future.
   ``I am convinced that we are a reformed party and will have good
chances,'' he told reporters. ``We will fight for votes and we are
ready for coalition.''
   Gysi pledged to move the party toward democratic socialism.
``It's clear to us that a monopoly capitalist path is as
questionable as a Stalinist path,'' he told a news conference after
his selection.
   The Communists have lost much of their control over society in
recent weeks and have granted historic concessions to the
opposition, including opening the Berlin Wall and other borders, in
a desperate effort to remain in power.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe:
   _Czechoslovakia's Communist premier said half of the new
government he will propose may include people with no ties to any
party, making the Communists a minority for the first time in four
decades.
   _Senior Communist Party officials met today in Moscow amid
speculation about a leadership shake-up and growing calls for the
party to abandon its domination of Soviet life.
   _Bulgaria's Communist Party expelled more of the old guard from
its leadership Friday, leaving the ruling Politburo with only three
members who were there when Todor Zhivkov was fired as party chief
Nov. 10.
   In a historic 16-hour party congress, the East German Communists
voted to change the party's name but refused calls to disband the
organization that has ruled East Germany for four decades.
   Party spokeswoman Brigitte Zimmermann, briefing reporters on the
closed session of the emergency congress, said earlier that Gysi
was the only candidate to become the party's third leader in less
than two months.
   The official news agency ADN said 95.3 percent of the 2,714
delegates participating voted for Gysi in balloting that took 5{
hours.
   In a statement, the party congress also apologized to the East
German people because the former leadership ``has led our country
into this crisis threatening its existence.''
   In a secret ballot, delegates also chose other members in a new
100-member party leadership over which Gysi will preside.
   Gysi, 41, a bespectacled, blunt-talking intellectual, is the
youngest Communist Party chief in the East bloc.
   He has backed sweeping political and economic reforms and has
acted as lawyer for the opposition group New Forum. He was a member
of the interim party leadership and is heading a committee
investigating corruption under the ousted leadership.
   Gysi is an avid supporter of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's ``glasnost'' policy of a more open and free society. He
has said the word ``glasnost belongs in the German vocabulary.''
   The opposition and the Communists have proposed national
elections be held May 6.
   ``We need a full break with failed Stalinism,'' Gysi told party
delegates Friday night. He said past leaders had enjoyed
``frightening'' privileges while the country plunged into a deep
political and economic crisis.
   Gysi, in his address to the congress, urged ``free competition''
in society. He called for a younger, less bureaucratic leadership
oriented toward ``grass-roots democracy'' and building a ``new
democratic socialist party.''
   He called the idea of German reunification, backed by many
anti-government demonstrators and the West German government, as
``nonsensical.''
   Gysi's nomination comes one day after criminal charges were
announced against former Communist Party chief Erich Honecker and
five of his ousted lieutenants. The ailing Honecker, ousted Oct. 18
and later expelled from the party, was under house arrest and his
associates were jailed.
   He was replaced by Egon Krenz, who instituted reform but was
forced to step down this week because of his long-time association
with Honecker's disgraced administation.
   The party's new platform and name were due to be discussed when
the congress reconvenes Dec. 23. The delegates voted 3-1 to change
the name of the party but had not agreed on a new name.
   Bitter debate at the congress reflected the rifts in the party.
Ms. Zimmermann said the party's membership had dropped from 2.3
million to less than 1.8 million in recent months.
   Manfred Gerlach, a non-Communist who is East Germany's interim
president, called for nationwide elections ``as soon as possible.''
   Gerlach also said he hoped all Soviet troops could be withdrawn
from the Communist nation in three years, according to Rep. Martin
Frost. The visiting Texas Democrat said Gerlach made the comment in
a meeting with five other U.S. Congressmen.

   East Germany's new Communist Party chief,
Gregor Gysi, is an articulate reformer and the youngest Communist
leader in Eastern Europe.
   Gysi, 41, was overwhelmingly elected party chairman today.
   He was born Jan. 16, 1948, in the Soviet sector of East Berlin.
After completing high school, Gysi studied law at East Berlin's
Humboldt University. He graduated in 1970, then worked for a year
as a legal assistant.
   In 1971, Gysi began practicing as a defense lawyer dealing
primarily in civil, labor and business cases.
   He has been chief of the East Berlin Attorney's Council since
1988 and also serves as the head of East Germany's 15 other
attorney boards.
   Most recently, Gysi represented the citizens' initiative New
Forum when the opposition group was seeking official recognition in
October.
   East German officials at the time declared New Forum illegal and
called its members ``enemies of the state.''
   However, Gysi insisted that rejection of New Forum's application
to formally register as a legally allowed organization violated
East German statutes, and the group was later officially registered.
   Following the mass resignation of the 10-man Communist Party
Politburo and 163-man Central Committee on Sunday, Gysi was named
to the 25-member leadership committee to restructure the shattered
party.
   Gysi is the son of Klaus Gysi, who had been Secretary of State
for Religious Affairs until he retired in the early 1980s.
   Gysi is an avid supporter of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's glasnost policy of a more open and free society. At a
Nov. 4 rally of about 1 million in East Berlin's Alexander Platz, a
large square in city center, Gysi said the word ``glasnost belongs
in the German vocabulary.''
   Gysi is divorced and the father of two children.

   Leaders of the European Community
today said they supported German reunification after receiving
assurances that West Germany will not seek claim to territories the
German states held before World War II.
   ``We seek the establishment of a state of peace in Europe in
which the German people will regain its unity through free
self-determination,'' said a draft of the 12-nation summit's
political declaration.
   The draft was completed after a tense dinner conversation Friday
in which West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said his nation would
not seek claim to German-speaking areas outside the German
countries.
   Many Europeans fear the emergence of a united, more powerful
Germany. West Germany's mighty economy already dominates the
continent.
   Reunification now seems possible because of the dramatic changes
taking place in East Germany. The nation has loosened travel
restrictions, opened the Berlin Wall, thrown out hard-line
Communist leaders, and stripped the Communist Party of its
constitutionally guaranteed hold on power.
   French President Francois Mitterrand said at the two-day
summit's closing news conference today that reunification was
acceptable.
   ``I am not afraid of reunification,'' he said. ``I consider it
to be legitimate.''
   But he also said that countries must adhere to international
treaties and other obligations ``unless they are prepared to create
dangerous and unnecessary tensions.''
   On Friday, the European leaders agreed to negotiations for a
system of central banks and eventually a single European currency.
They approved a social charter on the rights of labor unions, wages
and welfare. Both were approved over strong opposition from Britain.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said France and several
other delegations initially rejected West German phrasing on
reunification.
   The crucial moment came at Friday night's dinner when Dutch
Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and Italian Prime Minister Giulio
Andreotti pressed Kohl for his definition of reunification.
   Belgian and Dutch sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Kohl made clear that in his view, reunification applied only
to the two existing German nations and not to German-speaking areas
in neighboring countries.
   Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens described the
confrontation as ``the most tense moment of the summit.''
   Mitterrand accepted Kohl's definition, and French diplomats went
to work on redrafting the declaration on Germany.
   The draft declaration says reunification ``should take place
democratically and peacefully, and on the basis of all the
principles defined by the Helsinki Final Act, in a context of
dialogue and East-West cooperation.'' The 1975 Helsinki accords on
European cooperation and security fix post-war borders.
   The leaders also said they must draw closer ``in this crucial
period for Europe.''
   ``It is in the interest of all European states that the
Community should become stronger and accelerate its progress toward
union,'' the draft declaration said.
   No formal votes were taken Friday, and only Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher of Britain objected during the closed-door
discussions on the monetary conference and the social charter.
   The decision to move toward economic and monetary union means
the EC will convene a special conference in December 1990 to start
negotiations for the adoption of a single currency and a system of
central banks.
   France and West Germany overrode objections by Mrs. Thatcher
that radical monetary integration will rob member countries of
sovereign rights to decide national economic policy.
   Britain will attend the conference in what Thatcher aides
described as a ``spirit of constructive argument.'' Mrs. Thatcher
said the non-binding ``social charter'' for the rights of labor
unions would increase unemployment, raise costs and make EC goods
less competitive.

   A ruptured pipeline sent up a cloud of
propane gas and forced the evacuation of about 600 people
overnight, including the entire village of Butler.
   Officials evacuated a six-mile area around the village Friday
evening as a precaution in case the gas ingited and exploded.
Valves that supply a Phillips 66 pipeline were shut off, but gas
already in the system was still leaking several hours later, said
Illinois State Police Sgt. Philip Shreve.
   Officials found the cloud to be dissipating by sunrise and
allowed residents back to their homes shortly after 7 a.m., police
said.
   No injuries were reported.
   A farmer broke the pipe while cutting through the field with a
chisel plow, sheriff's deputies said.
   Firefighters said the land where the break occurred belongs to
Jack Rundquist, who was recently appointed the head of the Illinois
Department of Agriculture.
   The propane pipeline runs from Decatur to St. Louis. The leak
site is about a mile from Butler, which is about 50 miles northeast
of St. Louis.
   ``I was working on a hill that overlooks that area,'' said
farmer Don Faller, 38, who was evacuated with his wife and two
children. ``I saw a huge cloud starting to appear, very low to the
ground, very dense.''
   Phillips Petroleum Co. sent a repair crew to fix the pipeline,
Shreve said.
   Electrical power and gas to Butler was turned off for a time to
avoid sparks that could ignite the gas, said Douglas Meyer, a
nearby Hillsboro volunteer firefighter.
   A small fire did break out, but it was extinguished immediately,
he said.
   ``It's a pretty large leak,'' Meyer had said. ``There is already
a vapor cloud of 15 acres. If it ignites, that's a heck of a fire.''
   Authorities went from farmhouse to farmhouse to tell residents
to leave, and provided a school bus to move those who lacked
transportation.

   South Africa's new president
has moved further toward reform than his predecessors, but there's
a long way yet to go to end apartheid, delegates at an
anti-apartheid conference were told today.
   ``We know he has limits beyond which he will not go,'' Walter
Sisulu of the African National Congress said, referring to
President F.W. de Klerk. ``It is our historic purpose to take him
there or to go on without him.''
   About 4,500 delegates filled a university hall for the
Conference for a Democratic Future, the largest such conference
ever held in South Africa. The black, white, Indian and mixed-race
delegates represented roughly 2,100 organizations _ some of them
ideological rivals in past years.
   ``Your diversity is our strength,'' said Sisulu, a senior leader
of the guerrilla movement. ``The gigantic task of this conference
is to confirm the crucial importance of unity, and to plan a
program of mass action ... that will challenge the apartheid
state.''
   Decisions reached at the daylong conference are expected to be
announced Sunday.
   Last year, the government prohibited a similar conference
shortly before it was to take place but allowed this convention
even though many participants belong to groups which are banned.
   Sisulu, 77, and six other ANC leaders were freed unconditionally
in October by de Klerk after long prison terms. But Sisulu had no
praise for the president or the white-controlled government's offer
to negotiate some form of black political rights that stops short
of majority rule.
   ``Mr. de Klerk, your back is to the wall,'' Sisulu said. ``Come
stand on the floor of a conference like this. ... Submit to the
processes of democracy.''
   Observers from 19 foreign countries attended the conference,
including Norway's deputy foreign minister, Knut Wollenback, and a
Soviet professor, Irina Filatova. It was the first time in at least
40 years that a Soviet appeared at an opposition meeting in South
Africa.
   ``We reiterate our commitment to one person, one vote in a
united South Africa as the non-negotiable principle on which a
future South Africa will be built,'' Sisulu said.
   ``The regime ... has done its utmost to break us: whipping our
people, declaring the states of emergency, assassinating and
detaining our leaders,'' Sisulu said. ``And it has failed. We
gather here in greater numbers than ever before.''
   Jerry Mosala, of Black Consciousness Movement of Azania, took a
more militant line in his speech to the conference.
   ``A message must go out from this conference that the struggle
is not about to be abandoned in favor of negotiations,'' he said.
``The aim of the struggle is not to negotiate _ it is to eradicate
apartheid and capitalism.''

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers shot and
killed two Arabs in this village today during a march by hundreds
of people marking the start of the third year of the Palestinian
uprising.
   The protest was one of only a few demonstrations reported amid
the widespread curfews imposed by the army to try to prevent
violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip during a general
strike ordered by PLO-backed leaders of the uprising.
   In Beni Naim, soldiers were seen opening fire with tear gas and
then with bullets after masked youths began stoning troops and
border police on the edge of the village.
   Sara Abdul-Fattah Al-Manasra, 22, was shot in the chest,
according to officials at Alieh Hospital in nearby Hebron.
Witnesses identified the other victim as Kamel Hussein Humeidat, 28.
   At least one other person was reported shot and wounded during
the march through the village by hundreds of youths waving banners
and outlawed Palestinian flags.
   After the woman's death, her body was retrieved from the
hospital and more than 1,000 villagers marched to a cemetery in
Beni Naim to bury the victim. The village of 13,000 people is 3{
miles east of Hebron.
   ``With our souls, with our bodies, we will revenge you Sara,''
the crowd chanted. The marchers persisted despite army
announcements over loudspeakers that the village was under curfew
and all residents must return to their homes.
   Military officials confirmed that two people were killed and one
wounded in Beni Naim. One official said troops opened fire after
demonstrators pelted them with rocks and stones ``from all kinds of
places.''
   The deaths raised to 628 the number of Palestinians who have
been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians since the uprising
started in the Gaza Strip's Jebaliya refugee camp on Dec. 8, 1987.
   Forty-three Israelis also have been slain, and 155 other
Palestinians were killed by fellow Arabs on suspicion they
collaborated with Israel.
   Army and police spokesmen reported no other major violence
today. Stores and businesses were closed and traffic was largely
halted in the West Bank and Gaza, home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   To head off trouble, the army and police stepped up forces in
the occupied lands and Arab east Jerusalem and kept hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians confined to their homes.
   Curfews were maintained for a third day on the Gaza Strip, home
to 750,000 people, and for an ninth day on the West Bank's largest
city, Nablus, with a population of 120,000.

   Moslem separatists who kidnapped the
daughter of a Cabinet minister today threatened to kill her if five
of their jailed colleagues are not freed.
   It was the first crisis faced by the week-old government of
Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
   Officials said commandos and negotiators were sent to Kashmir
state to seek the release of Rubaiya Mufti, daughter of Home
Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, who was abducted Friday.
   Members of the Kashmir Liberation Front demanded the release of
five jailed members of the group, which seeks secession of the
northeastern state from India.
   ``If our demands are not accepted by 7 p.m. Monday (8:30 a.m.
EST), we will throw her body within the municipal limit of
Srinagar,'' the kidnappers said in a statement to newspaper offices.
   Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, is a
tourist resort 95 miles north of Jammu, the state's winter capital.
   The Urdu-language statement issued by the kidnappers also said
relatives of police officers would be kidnapped if the demands were
not met.
   Rubaiya was kidnapped three days after her father was appointed
home minister and a day after he was asked to head a government
committee to resolve separatism issues in Jammu-Kashmir and Punjab.
Soon after taking office on Dec. 2, Singh promised to resolve such
regional conflicts.
   Officials said Singh's government had formed a five-member
negotiating team to seek Rubaiya's release.
   ``We are trying to talk to the kidnappers, but we are yet to
establish contact with them,'' a Home Ministry official in New
Delhi said on condition of anonymity.
   Officials in Jammu said the team was headed by an army colonel,
but they did not release his name.
   Police began search operations in Srinagar.
   ``We have announced a red alert across the state,'' said police
Chief Ghulam Jeelani Pandit. ``We are keeping the option of a
military action open,'' he said without elaborating.
   Commandos flown from New Delhi had been asked to stand by, he
said.
   Rubaiya, a 22-year-old medical student and intern at a Srinagar
hospital, was kidnapped on her way home from work, said another
senior police officer on condition of anonymity.
   Three militants armed with Chinese-made AK-47 rifles stopped a
van in which Rubaiya was traveling with 10 other people, and
escaped with her in a car.
   Later, in a telephone call to Sayeed's Srinagar residence,
members of the group demanded freedom for the five jailed
militants, police said.
   In New Delhi, a man who answered the telephone at Sayeed's home
said they had learned Rubaiya was unharmed.
   ``It is too early to say what the government will do,'' he said.
The man did not give his name.
   Sayeed is India's first Moslem home minister. His appointment by
Singh, a Hindu, was seen as an effort to help resolve tensions
between Hindus and Moslems.
   Moslems form 11 percent of India's 880 million people, and
Hindus make up 80 percent.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
Militants have been agitating for secession from India, claiming
that Kashmir ought to be an independent nation or part of Moslem
Pakistan.
   Kashmir is claimed by India and Pakistan, and the two countries
have fought three wars over the territory since they gained
independence from Britain in 1947.
   Jammu-Kashmir state was formed from two kingdoms. Jammu was
predominantly Hindu, while Kashmir was mostly Moslem. Today, 64
percent of the combined Jammu-Kashmir state are Moslems.

   The U.S. government has confirmed Iraq's
launch of a rocket capable of putting a satellite into orbit,
according to a State Department spokesman.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher was asked at a press briefing Friday
about the Arab country's announcement Thursday that it had launched
a three-stage rocket two days earlier from the Al-Anbar Space
Research Base west of Baghdad.
   Boucher told reporters ``the State Department understands that
the Defense Intelligence Agency can confirm a launch of an Iraqi
rocket capable of putting a satellite into orbit. At this point we
don't have any further details.''
   The American official noted that the United States had ``long
been concerned about the destabilizing effects of the spread of
ballistic missiles and missile technology, especially in areas of
tension such as the Middle East.''
   ``We have made our concerns known publicly and through
diplomatic channels to countries in the region and we will continue
to do so,'' Boucher said.

<TEXT>
   Rebellious inmates surrendered to
authorities today at two of four prisons where riots occurred after
Parliament refused to extend a nationwide amnesty to hard-core
criminals.
   At leave five prisoners have died during the uprisings.
   About 1,500 prisoners at the Czarne Prison on the Baltic Coast
and 1,000 inmates at Goleniow Prison in northwest Poland gave up
after police and prison guards prepared assaults at the facilities,
the state PAP news service said.
   On Friday, the government authorized the use of force to end the
disturbances which began at the prisons Thursday, the agency said.
   Four inmates were reported killed in the worst uprising, at
Czarne Prison, near the city of Slupsk, and PAP said the stabbed
and beaten victims had been lynched by fellow prisoners during the
riots.
   Authorities who re-entered Goleniow Prison, near the city of
Szczecin, also found the charred body of a prisoner in one of the
two pavilions of the prison that were set on fire by inmates, PAP
said.
   Fire also destroyed the prison hospital and library.
   Besides Czarne and Goleniow, about 1,000 inmates rioted at
Kaminsk in north-central Poland, and 850 inmates rioted at
Nowogard, also near Szczecin, TV said. The four prisons are for
hard-core, or habitual, criminals. The uprisings at Kaminsk and
Nowogard continued today.
   The revolts began after the Sejm, or lower house of Parliament,
turned down a Senate proposal to extend the new Solidarity-led
government's far-reaching amnesty program to habitual criminals.
   At Czarne, prisoners learned of the decision on the TV news and
immediately ``started destroying equipment, set warehouse
facilities on fire and attacked prison guards who tried to get the
situation under control,'' PAP said.
   On Friday, state television broadcast scenes of inmates wrapped
in blankets gathered on the fire-damaged prison roof, with flames
visible through the windows of the brick building.
   ``Why are we doing it? Because we don't agree with the verdicts
that were handed out in the 1980s,'' one prisoner with bandages
over his eyes told a TV interviewer.
   The amnesty was proposed by the Solidarity members of Parliament
to give prisoners a second chance under Poland's new
non-Communist-led government.
   ``We cannot allow prisoners to take the law into their own
hands. The decision on the amnesty is final,'' Justice Minister
Aleksander Bentkowski said on the national TV news Friday.
   He noted that the amnesty was an ``act of mercy'' by the Sejm
that will benefit 17,000 inmates nationwide but that the Sejm
concluded it could not include prisoners who have four or more
convictions.
   The Polish Senate had urged broadening the amnesty so that it
would no longer exclude multiple offenders, committers of major
thefts and those convicted of vehicular manslaughter under
influence of alcohol.
   The Senate proposal aroused widespread debate among Poles who
feared it would lead to a wholesale release of criminals at a time
when crime rates are already increasing.

   A cargo ship hit an oil platform in the
southern Gulf of Suez, causing millions of dollars in damage to the
rig but no casualties, a senior oil company official said Saturday.
   He said the collision spilled natural gas and a small amount of
oil from the platform into the Gulf of Suez. The platform is owned
by the Gulf Petroleum Co., or GUPCO, a joint Egyptian-American
venture with major operations in the gulf between mainland Egypt
and Sinai.
   The official, who demanded anonymity, identified the ship as the
Philippine-registered Panay Sampaguita, bound for France from
Singapore with a load of iron and timber.
   Police in Suez impounded the 27,652-ton carrier just outside the
city harbor on orders of government prosecutors who began an
investigation.
   The GUPCO official said the accident occurred shortly before 4
a.m. Friday in the Ras Shukeir area, about 140 miles south of Suez.
   ``The weather at the time was good, and the ship obviously was
traveling outside the navigation channel,'' he said.
   He said he expected damage to exceed $10 million on the
platform, which produces about 6,000 barrels of crude oil daily. A
ship hit the same platform in 1987, and repairs cost $1 million, he
said.
   In London, Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Service said it was
informed that the Panay Sampaguita, managed by World Marine Co.
Ltd. of Tokyo, sustained some damage.

   People are happily using words
like ``freedom'' and ``democracy'' these days, but their joy is
tempered by worry about the future.
   The rush to undo 40 years of repression is a plunge into the
unknown by a politically divided people not given to recklessness.
   On the streets, thundering crowds appear to have smashed the
elaborate apparatus that had left them powerless to criticize the
state beyond a guarded whisper or swift slash of wit.
   Up close and alone, however, Czechoslovaks, like East Germans,
Poles and Hungarians, still face the painful process of learning to
shape the politics that govern them.
   A lightning revolution fired spirits. But decades of dashed
hopes and broken promises have left their mark.
   ``We are confused,'' said Jitka Nyvltova, a young artisan. ``We
are speaking with emotion, saying what is in our hearts. This is
very dangerous. We must act with great calm.''
   She fears the Communist Party will exploit divisions among the
opposition, retaining its control and perhaps exacting revenge on
the more daring.
   She knows the old apparatus is protected not only by a
privileged class but also by workers, farmers and pensioners who
have made peace with the devil they know.
   Communism's monopoly was excised from the constitution.
Non-communist ministers entered the government. But elections,
though promised, are not yet scheduled. Nor have they been won.
   Even in Prague, but especially in smaller towns and farm
villages, many are still testing the wind. Few expect Communists to
dominate free elections. But there are all those shades of gray.
   In Prague's Old Town, a children's book writer chatted about
freedom, relishing on his tongue the feel of terms like ``Communist
thugs.'' Suddenly, he stopped and frowned.
   ``Read back to me anything you quote me on,'' he told the
American reporter taking notes. ``The secret police, you know.''
   Specialists see critical and deep-seated obstacles to defining
freedom and restoring democracy.
   ``This is a morally sick society, and it will take longer to
cure than it will to reform the economy,'' said Dr. Miroslav
Borecky, a Prague psychiatrist.
   Czechoslovakia's death rate from stress was alarming among men
in their 40s, he said. ``It is not comparable to stress in the West
where you win or lose. Here, you don't exist.''
   Before, people only spoke out among friends, but they were sure
of a job and, most likely, a car and vacation cottage. No one
worried about the next meal. Hard work was optional and seldom
rewarding.
   Now, in the heat of their first political campaign in half a
century, Czechoslovaks must find a way to fit Western freedoms in
with socialism's traditional freedoms from choice.
   Some Czechoslovaks think liberty will prove to be a miracle drug.
   ``Our young people were supposed to be so dispirited, rotten,
but look at them,'' said historian Desider Galsky, 68. ``Their
elders are so proud of them, it is touching.''
   The revolution's rejection of violence, like revulsion to the
police brutality that triggered it, formed a basis for a new social
model, he said.
   ``They did it without breaking a window or smashing a car,'' he
said. ``Never in history was there such a revolution, so elegant,
so sophisticated. It was so Czech.''
   But Galsky agreed that hard times lie ahead, and no one knows
the extent of the bill to be paid.
   Czechoslovakia cannot alter its course without inflation,
layoffs and chaotic disruptions, economists say. Sacrifices can be
demanded only by a strong, popular consensus government.
   And consensus will not be easy. Under Marxism, everything but
politics was political. People took no part in government, but
daily life required alliances, compromises and ward-heeling.
Czechoslovak politics are minimalist.
   At Wenceslas Square, for example, three youths in gas masks
burst from the metro and swept the street with exaggerated motions.
They were ecologists pushing one of the countless parties forming
weekly.
   Even immediate victories mean glitches in the system. For
example, an end to censorship gave Czechoslovaks new access to
generations of literature. But only so many manuscripts at a time
can be edited, printed and distributed.
   So much banned work is backed up, for example, that writers
eager to say something new, and their editors, may have to wait
years for the logjam to clear.
   ``At least 500,000 books are waiting in warehouses, and the
government has promised to put them in shops,'' said Leo Pavlat, a
publishing house editor. ``This is a tough time to be a new
writer.''
   But, jokes Roman Rehak, there are new opportunities. A student
who climbs mountains, he was enlisted to scramble up rooftops to
remove Communist red stars and outmoded banners.
   Rehak admits to fear, but he is grateful for what has been won
so far. For one thing, he said, good jobs and privileges are no
longer the preserve of the party faithful.
   ``We will have to distinguish people who are creeps, and now we
have the right and power to remove those creeps,'' he said.
   Optimists say the rush of events is only a taste of what will
come. They are counting on the Czechoslovak industriousness,
flexibility and flair that made this nation of 15 million a
prosperous democracy between world wars.
   At the very least, long submission did not dim Czechoslovak wit
and peoples' ability to jab fun at themselves.
   On its latest cover, the satirical weekly Dikobraz ( Porcupine)
remarked on the job revolutionaries face in translating freedom and
democracy for Czechoslovak tongues.
   It showed an average-guy character flinging open his Superman
cape to uncover the word: ``Forward!'' A close look reveals he is a
tree trunk, with a mass of roots snaking deep into the ground.

   Political jealousy, military
factionalism and President Corazon Aquino's failure to deliver on
promises of her ``people power revolution'' account for the cycle
of coup attempts that has rocked this nation.
   About 400 rebels surrendered Saturday in Cebu, ending the sixth
and bloodiest attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino.
   The political and economic damage has been devastating. The
violence shattered the illusion of stability, carefully crafted by
Mrs. Aquino's advisers.
   It also exposed the disarray in a government that all too often
blames its own shortcomings on the legacy of former President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   ``She's been hurt, there's no question about it,'' a senior Bush
administration official told reporters in Washington. The official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mrs. Aquino's ability to
survive depends on how well she learns from the coup attempt.
   It is far from certain any lessons will be learned.
   Mrs. Aquino reorganized her Cabinet after coup attempts in
November 1986 and August 1987 and promised ``a new beginning,''
which proved largely rhetorical.
   ``This coup happened because of her administration's wishy-washy
approach to national problems,'' columnist Pedro Chanco wrote in
the newspaper Malaya. ``My fear with Mrs. Aquino's tough posture
(during the coup attempt) is the likelihood that she will forget
all about it when the crisis is over.''
   Despite talk of national reconciliation, Mrs. Aquino has never
mastered the art of dealing with political rivals, essential to
building a consensus in this fragmented society.
   Behind the public image of the frail, vulnerable widow stands an
iron-willed woman, whom associates describe as stubborn to a fault.
   She tends to dismiss criticism as the carping of jealous rivals.
   But Mrs. Aquino faces a military deeply politicized after years
of martial law, which Marcos imposed from 1972 until 1981. Each
coup attempt has enhanced the influence of the military at the
expense of civilian authority.
   Although Mrs. Aquino ruled out negotiations with the rebels,
military commanders opened talks and persuaded most of them to
surrender. Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa told Mrs.
Aquino of the talks after they began.
   Mutineers will be tried by military courts, which have been
reluctant to impose harsh sentences after previous coup attempts.
   Ironically, the ``people power revolution'' itself encouraged
the notion that the military should play a role in politics. The
revolt began in February 1986 as a coup attempt against Marcos,
organized by some of the same officers who have since tried to
overthrow Mrs. Aquino.
   It succeeded after Cardinal Jaime L. Sin and secular groups sent
hundreds of thousands of followers into the streets to ``protect''
the mutineers from Marcos' troops.
   Young officers of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, or RAM,
who led the 1986 uprising, assumed they would share power with the
president they helped put in office.
   Instead, Mrs. Aquino filled her Cabinet with many longtime
supporters bitter at the military for martial law.
   She also made peace overtures to Communist and Moslem rebels
while others in her government threatened to prosecute soldiers for
human rights abuses under Marcos.
   That deepened suspicion and resentment in the ranks and prompted
the reform movement to begin plotting. The movement, organized in
1985 to fight corruption in the ranks, is believed to have led at
least three coup attempts, including the latest.
   Its members include Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, leader
of the August 1987 coup attempt. Honasan is believed to have played
a key role in the recent attempt.
   Apart from political jealousy, movement members were motivated
by a belief that their goals were not realized. Corruption persists
in both the military and civilian government.
   Although most Filipinos remain suspicious of a military
government, a growing number are dissatisfied with Mrs. Aquino
because of rising prices, decaying infrastructure and a lack of
decisive leadership.
   In 1986, many Filipinos assumed Mrs. Aquino would introduce
sweeping social, political and economic reforms to transform the
nation's feudalistic society.
   Instead, she simply restored traditional democratic
institutions, including a bicameral Congress, and left the job of
reform to them.
   A bicameral legislature, patterned after the U.S. system, has
proven unwieldy here and incapable of speeding controversial
legislation.
   Mrs. Aquino has ruled out a second term in 1992. As a ``lame
duck,'' she finds it difficult to bring to heel errant legislators
whose terms run concurrently with her own.
   Since parties are weak and based on temporary personal
alliances, congressional leaders also have trouble delivering the
vote on controversial legislation.
   Leaders of the recent coup attempt called for a
civilian-military junta to initiate reforms and organize a
referendum to decide what form of government to establish.
   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, fired as defense minister after the
November 1986 coup attempt, believes a unicameral, parliamentary
system _ with a figurehead president and prime minister _ would be
better.
   ``It provides a safety valve that will release political steam
and enable the people to make a vote of no confidence, to dislodge
the government without resorting to arms,'' Enrile said. ``This is
the way to end all these recurring coups.''
   The latest attempt occurred as millions were facing growing
economic hardships due to rising prices, electricity shortages, a
decline in the peso and transportation problems.
   For months, many supporters were warning Mrs. Aquino that
discontent was mounting.
   Intead of taking action, Mrs. Aquino asked for patience and
blamed the problem on Marcos. She went to West Germany and France
in August and to Canada and the United States last month, seeking
investments. She took her 18-year-old daughter, Kris, to North
America to shop for Christmas presents.
   ``In all humility, I can whisper now, `perhaps I told you so,'
'' said Jose Luis Alcuaz, fired as telecommunications chief after
publicly warning a coup was imminent. ``The `fed-up factor' has
reached alarming proportions.''

   Central American presidents reconvene on
Sunday in Costa Rica in an attempt to reverse what has been a
steady deterioration of the peace process they began three years
ago.
   The two-day summit will be attended by the presidents of Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala, for whom
almost nothing has gone right since they met in August in Honduras.
   The peace process ``urgently needs to be put back on track,'' as
one U.S. official put it last week.
   Nicaragua's leftist government is bitterly disappointed that the
Dec. 5 deadline for demobilizing the Contra rebels _ agreed to last
August _ has passed with the insurgents still intact and still
receiving non-lethal U.S. assistance.
   Coupled with that was Nicaragua's decision six weeks ago to
suspend a cease-fire with the Contras that had been in effect for
19 months. Negotiations to restore the cease-fire broke down last
month.
   There have been setbacks to the peace process on the Salvadoran
front as well.
   The crash last month of a plane from Nicaragua carrying
surface-to-air missiles to the FMLN rebels in El Salvador led it to
suspend relations with Managua. The murder earlier in November of
six Jesuit priests, presumably by rightist death squads,
underscored how far El Salvador is from national reconciliation.
   The massacre occurred just five days after the start of the most
sustained rebel offensive since the conflict began 10 years ago.
   The Central America issue was one of the main points of
contention at last week's summit meeting between President Bush and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush wants the Soviets to do more to prevent cross-border
deliveries of weaponry of Soviet bloc equipment to the Salvadoran
rebels.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said last week that he will
ask his Central American colleagues to set Dec. 31 as the new
deadline for demobilizing the Contras.
   He said Nicaragua will not agree to a deadline beyond that date
but has not said what he will do if the Contras are still in
existence afterward.
   The rebels, backed by the Bush administration, want to stay
together until after national elections set for Feb. 25. If the
elections are free and fair, the Contras say that is the best
guarantee that their return to their homeland will be safe.
   Mistrust between the Sandinistas and the Bush administration
continues to run high. U.S. officials are worried that the
Sandinistas may be laying the groundwork either to call off the
elections or to steal them.
   Nicaraguan authorities, meanwhile, have promised a free and fair
process and say the elections will go ahead war or no war.

   U.S. National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft
said today that Washington and Beijing should set aside differences
over China's crackdown on the pro-democracy movement and strengthen
their relationship.
   Scowcroft's visit ended a U.S. ban on high-level meetings with
China. He and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
arrived earlier in the day as special envoys to brief Chinese
leaders on the U.S.-Soviet summit in Malta.
   ``We believe it is important that we not exhaust ourselves in
placing blame for problems that exist,'' Scowcroft said at a dinner
held by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
   Scowcroft said he had come ``to bring new impetus and vigor into
our bilateral relationship and seek new areas of agreement. ... We
come to reduce the negative influence of irritants in the
relationship.''
   The Chinese, who have blamed Washington for current friction,
showed their desire to improve ties by arranging meetings with
China's top leaders Sunday.
   Scowcroft and Eagleburger are to meet with Premier Li Peng,
Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and senior leader
Deng Xiaoping before leaving in the afternoon for Japan. They are
to return to Washington on Monday.
   Deng, 85, retired from his last party post in November. He also
has cut down his public apppearances, and his meeting with the
Americans is a clear sign that China hopes to end the feuding.
   Foreign Minister Qian, in his banquet toast, said the special
envoys' visit shows the importance President Bush attaches to
U.S.-Chinese relations, ``for which we would like to express our
appreciation.''
   ``Important as our differences are,'' Qian said, ``they cannot
obliterate the major common interests between us.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a
statement that while Bush ``deplores the tragedy of Tiananmen
Square last June, China nevertheless remains part of the world
around us. The president views China as an important country in
world affairs.''
   Relations between Beijing and Washington hit a low after the
Chinese crushed the student-led, pro-democracy movement. The United
States criticized the violence and repression, and Beijing accused
Washington of interfering in China's internal affairs.
   The Chinese government says 300 people, mostly soldiers, died
during the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing on June 3-4. Witnesses and Western sources say hundreds or
even thousands died, most of the victims unarmed civilians.
   In the past three weeks, the Foreign Ministry has lodged three
official protests with the United States over congressional actions
to expand economic sanctions against China and to allow Chinese
students to extend their stays in the United States.
   But Chinese leaders, in recent meetings with former President
Richard Nixon and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, also
have expressed hope that relations could be improved.
   There was speculation in Beijing that the two sides may discuss
how to resolve the situation of astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, the
pro-democracy dissident who has been hiding in the U.S. Embassy
with his wife, Li Shuxian, since the crackdown. The Chinese have
branded the couple counterrevolutionaries and issued warrants for
their arrest.
   An embassy official declined comment on whether the Americans
discussed Fang in their talks with Qian today.

   Old habits die hard in the intelligence
community, where a U.S. government task force says it still has its
hands full countering Soviet disinformation linking the United
States to baby-buying, AIDS and assassinations.
   Neither the slow thaw in the cold war nor last year's superpower
decision to set up a U.S.-Soviet panel ``for clarifying and
correcting alleged errors in information disseminated by the other
side'' has stopped the Active Measures Working Group from meeting
every two weeks and gathering material for its annual report.
   The Soviets say the reports ``do not provide the spirit of
friendly relations.'' Further, they say the United States is
equally at fault for spreading disinformation, although they offer
few examples.
   The Active Measures Working Group is chaired by the State
Department and has representatives from State, the CIA, Defense
Intelligence Agency, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the
U.S. Information Agency, and the Defense and Justice departments.
The term ``active measures'' is a literal translation from the
Russian and means covert or deceptive operations.
   The group's annual report was ordered by Congress in 1985. This
year's slick-covered, 64-page issue was presented to Congress in
October and says its purpose ``is to reveal and describe Soviet
influence activities that are deceptive and illegitimate.''
   The report covers news reports, forgeries and anti-American
propaganda that appeared worldwide from June 1987 to November 1988.
It says: ``Soviet active measures campaigns are integrated
operations, carried out with the approval of the Politburo or
Central Committee Secretariat.''
   Reports starting in 1987 said that South American children were
being bought up and taken to the United States to be sacrificed for
their organs. Such stories circulated worldwide, showing up in
Portugal, Sweden, Turkey, Britain, East Germany, India and
Australia. The United States responds by sending U.S. embassies
statements to deny the allegations as they appear.
   ``There was a rash of it only a few weeks ago,'' said a State
Department official, who followed department guidelines by speaking
only on condition he not be identified. ``Once these things get
going they are very hard to stop.''
   He displayed recent clippings from Soviet writers about other
issues. One, an interview with a state-run Novosti writer, quoted a
Soviet doctor as saying the AIDS virus began in 1952 when the
United States set off a nuclear bomb on Bikini atoll.
   Last year the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to deal
with disinformation issues directly. The latest Active Measures
report, mentioning the joint U.S.-Soviet group, says: ``Despite
this apparent breakthrough, active measures have continued.''
   Igor Bulay, press counselor for the Soviet Embassy, objects.
   ``There is no intentional policy on the part of the Soviet Union
to distort facts which concern the United States,'' Bulay said.
``It was never a policy,'' he added, saying some of the reports
could have been the work of journalists angry at the United States
for being ``labeled as coming from the `evil empire.'''
   The State Department official said the anti-American propaganda
has been reduced in the era of glasnost, but it has not been
eliminated. ``The practices of decades are apparently difficult to
forsake,'' the official said.
   As a sign of better times, he noted: ``We don't see broadcasts
to South America deliberately telling people about the poor little
children who are being fattened up for their organs.''
   The Active Measures report says meetings of the joint
U.S.-Soviet group on disinformation were held this year in January
and April ``with results described as encouraging.''
   Bulay, at the Soviet Embassy, said the joint group was designed
to deal with these issues and he suggested that the State
Department cease its annual reports.
   ``There are a number of cases we are raising to the United
States,'' he said, saying one of them was the portrayal of the
Soviet army during U.S. military maneuvers earlier this year. ``I'm
not mentioning specific cases because we had semi-confidential
talks with the United States.''
   The Soviet diplomat said the State Department group is
``self-serving.''
   ``It certainly could be reciprocated,'' he said. ``There's
enough material for such a report. But there's a feeling it won't
promote better relations.''

   The new Communist premier today
opened talks aimed at putting the final touches to a coalition
government in which Communists are likely to be in the minority for
the first time in 41 years.
   Hard-line Communist President Gustav Husak planned to speak on
national television tonight in an address expected to deal with
opposition demands that he resign by Sunday.
   And tens of thousands of Czechoslovaks streamed into Austria to
shop or sightsee today, their first non-working day since their
government lifted restrictions on free travel to the West.
   Premier Marian Calfa, on the job for only his third day,
received the head of the Socialist Party at his offices and planned
to meet representatives of the Communist Party, the opposition and
other smaller political groups, the state news agency CTK said.
   Calfa on Friday said on national state TV that ``roughly
one-half of the new government could be composed of experts with no
political affiliation.'' Calfa assumed his position after premier
Ladislav Adamec resigned Thursday.
   The other half of the Cabinet seats would go to the Communists
and members of the four other political parties permitted in
Czechoslovakia, according to government spokesman Marcel Jansen.
   A woman at the government press office, who refused to identify
herself on the telephone, said it was expected the makeup of the
new Cabinet would be made public by Sunday afternoon.
   Calfa's announcement was a huge concession to opposition leaders
who have set a Sunday deadline for the leadership to name a new
government that satisfies their demands for democratic reforms.
They have staged mass demonstrations and threatened to call a
general strike Monday.
   Communists relinquished their majority on Friday in the regional
government in Slovakia, one of the two republics that comprise the
nation.
   Slovakia's Communist premier, Pavel Hrivnak, and his entire
Cabinet were ousted, the state news agency CTK said. Former Justice
Minister Milan Cic was asked to form a new Cabinet.
   Under an agreement with the opposition, independents would have
nine seats in the 17-member regional Cabinet. The rest of the
government would include six Communists and one representative each
from two smaller, legal parties.
   The move follows a similiar agreement Wednesday in the Czech
republic, which made Communists a minority in that regional
government although they retained the leadership and key
ministerial posts.
   The composition of both regional governments are precursors to
what is expected to be approval of new national government that
makes the Communists a minority for the first time since they took
over complete rule in 1948.
   A statement issued early today by the main opposition group,
Civic Forum, said Friday's talks brought together ``representatives
of all the decisive political forces'' and that they parted
``united in the hope'' they could help Calfa form a government to
be sworn in Sunday.
   ``This should be a government of national understanding,'' the
statement said.
   The changes come as equally sweeping developments in East
Germany, where the Communists today named opposition lawyer Gregor
Gysi as party leader.
   Officials and opposition leaders in Prague held two sets of
talks on Friday. Afterward, a visibly pleased Vaclav Havel, a top
opposition leader, said ``the results will be public soon'' but
declined to divulge details.
   Vasil Mohorita, a member of the ruling Politburo, told reporters
a coalition government ``representing all parts'' of the political
spectrum would be named by Sunday. He did not elaborate, adding
only that there would be fewer Communists.
   Another dissident at the talks, Slovak activist Jan Carnogursky,
said ``certain gains have been won and it has been agreed that all
the political interests will be represented.''
   He said it was possible that he would become a deputy prime
minister.
   CTK took the highly unusual step of interviewing Carnogursky and
fellow Slovak activist Miroslav Kusy, another government candidate,
on Friday night.
   Carnogurksy said he thinks free elections could be held in March.
   Husak's fate was expected to be decided before Sunday. Husak,
76, one of the last remaining members of the old guard leadership,
supported the Soviet-led invasion that crushed the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms enacted by Communist liberals in 1968.
   Mohorita said that Husak should remain in office to swear in the
new government, ``otherwise we would have a constitutional crisis.''
   In the past three weeks, mass pro-democracy demonstrations
headed up by the Civic Forum opposition and its Slovak counterpart,
Public Against Violence, have forced the Communists to relinquish
their 41-year monopoly on political power.
   But a government named last Sunday by Adamec included only five
non-Communists in a 21-member Cabinet, and left Communists in
control of all key ministries.
   Initially, Adamec scheduled to announce the new government on
Friday. But his resignation on Thursday, and growing demands for
genuine power-sharing, forced a new talks.

   A surgeon who performed the nation's second liver
transplant from a living donor, taking part of a father's liver and
implanting it in his 15-month-old daughter, said the operation
proved ``very difficult.''
   The daughter, Sarina, underwent 7{ hours of surgery at the
University of Chicago Medical Center on Friday, leaving the
operating room just after 10:30 p.m., hospital spokesman John
Easton said.
   She and her father, 20-year-old Robert Jones, were listed in
critical but stable condition today in the intensive care unit as
is customary in such cases, Easton said.
   ``It was a very difficult operation, but I expect her to be
fairly stable afterward,'' said Dr. Christoph Broelsch, the
transplant surgeon.
   This morning, doctors described the girl's progress so far as
``outstanding,'' said hospital spokeswoman Mary Fetsch. And Jones
could be moved out of intensive care by the end of the day, she
said.
   In the operation, Jones, a dry-wall installer and contractor
from Millington, Tenn., near Memphis, had the left lobe of his
liver removed and the partial organ implanted into Sarina.
   Broelsch said that during the operation he spotted lingering
signs of a bacterial infection that she came down with two weeks
ago, which had postponed the operation. ``They were able to clear
out the remnants of the infection,'' Easton said.
   ``(Jones is) awake and talking to his wife. He's uncomfortable
as you might expect, but he is wide awake and doing very well,''
Broelsch said.
   Dr. Peter Whitington, director of pediatric transplant services
at the hospital, said the operation was not expected to be the most
difficult hurdle for Sarina to overcome.
   ``Her difficulty is going to be recovery, convalescing,
regaining nutritional status, overcoming any infections,'' he said.
   Sarina's mother, 21-year-old Michelle Jones, said the roughest
part of the ordeal had been the waiting, but the family had no
reservations about the surgery.
   ``I'm excited that it's finally come true,'' she said at an
afternoon news conference. ``We've been waiting for a long time,
and it's finally here.''
   Sarina has suffered since birth from a usually fatal disorder
called biliary atresia.
   The congenital disorder also afflicted 21-month-old Alyssa
Smith, who last week received part of her mother's liver at the
hospital in the first living-donor liver transplant in the United
States.
   Alyssa, of Schertz, Texas, near San Antonio, was doing well
Friday, with her liver function ``rapidly improving toward normal''
and no signs of her body rejecting the transplant, Whitington said.
   Her mother, Teresa Smith, a 29-year-old schoolteacher, was
released from the hospital Thursday.
   Whitington said Sarina was not nearly as strong as Alyssa going
into her transplant, but ``we thought it was her best chance for
survival and the best graft available under the circumstances.''
   A team led by Broelsch began removing part of the liver of
Sarina's father at about 7.30 a.m. and began surgery on Sarina at 3
p.m.
   Whitington said the father's only misgiving about the operation
was a fear that ``his daughter might die before he woke up from the
surgery.''

<HEAD>Candidates Switching Sides on Abortion</HEAD>

   In dazzling leaps or small steps, Republican
and Democratic candidates are moving away from anti-abortion
positions as they prepare for 1990 campaigns that promise to
spotlight the divisive issue.
   ``They're changing so fast it's hard to keep up with them all,''
says Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League.
   Her abortion-rights lobby has been swamped with news of converts
in the weeks since anti-abortion candidates were defeated in
Virginia and New Jersey governors races, and as an impression grows
that electoral majorities favor maintaining legal abortions.
   The most startling reversal came last week by Ohio Attorney
General Anthony Celebrezze, the leading contender for the
Democratic nomination for governor.
   After more than a decade as an outspoken opponent of abortion,
Celebrezze declared that if elected he would veto any legislation
banning abortion and would support public funding of the procedure
for poor women.
   His move was regarded as an attempt to head off the potential
Democratic candidacy of an abortion-rights supporter, Joel Hyatt.
   Celebrezze stunned and infuriated national anti-abortion
leaders, who distributed copies of a statement he signed three
years ago pledging support for legislation to prohibit abortion
except to prevent the death of the mother, and to oppose the use of
tax money for abortions.
   ``A total flip-flop for what he perceives as personal political
gain,'' said an outraged David O'Steen, executive director of the
National Right to Life Committee.
   Celebrezze, however, is only the latest and most clear-cut
example of 1990 candidates trying to stake out the most
advantageous position for their respective races.
   Democratic gubernatorial candidates Rep. Bill Nelson in Florida,
Neil Hartigan in Illinois, Tom Miller in Iowa and Frank Belotti in
Massachusetts have all taken steps or made comments that have been
seen as moderating past opposition to abortion or siding outright
with abortion-rights forces.
   Sharp divisions among Republican have emerged. Two GOP
candidates for governor of Texas, Tom Luce and Jack Rains, have
begun airing television commercials declaring their support for
legal abortions. They have drawn battle lines against anti-abortion
primary candidates including former Rep. Kent Hance.
   In Rains' case, the move came just a few weeks after he appeared
at a Dallas fund-raiser for a Texas anti-abortion group and said,
``I stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this cause.''
   Driving the political turnabouts is the Supreme Court's ruling
last summer that gave states more leeway to regulate abortions.
That thrust the issue back in the hands of state politicians.
   ``It's going to be a very major factor in gubernatorial races,''
said Kevin Phillips, publisher of the American Political Report.
   ``It's a defining issue,'' said Alice Travis, director of
programs for the Democratic National Committee. ``It's like civil
rights was, in some ways like the Vietnam War was. It tells you who
a person is, and what he or she believes.''
   In Senate races, the re-election battle of Democrat Tom Harkin
of Iowa, an abortion-rights supporter, against Republican Rep. Tom
Tauke, an abortion opponent, is already one of the most closely
watched 1990 contests.
   While Democrats were the beneficiaries of the new political
focus on abortion in 1989 races, the party has a number of
incumbents on the other side of the issue.
   In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Robert Casey is an opponent of
abortion and could face a Republican who supports abortion rights.
Republican Barbara Hafer, the state auditor, has the Pennsylvania
GOP's endorsement.
   Another key race is in Florida, where Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez made abortion the issue when he called a special
legislative session to enact abortion restrictions. He failed to
win passage of his proposals, and he now faces a Republican primary
against a state senator, Marlene Woodson-Howard, who supports
abortion rights. Bracing for a tough battle and on NARAL's national
hit list, Martinez has amassed a $4 million campaign war chest.
   In the Democratic race to oppose Martinez, Nelson and George
Stuart, a state senator, are both running as supporters of abortion
rights.
   Nelson in the past has opposed abortion, however, and the
national abortion-rights lobby remains skeptical of him. He was
among some two-dozen House members who switched positions last
October _ from a similar vote a year earlier _ to support
liberalized federal funding of abortions for poor women.
   ``He says he's been pro-choice, when he has not been,''
Michelman said.
   Until Celebrezze's switch, Illinois' attorney general Hartigan
had been the primary object of anti-abortion leaders' wrath. He is
running for governor against Republican Jim Edgar, the secretary of
state, who supports abortion rights.
   Hartigan had been counted as opposing abortion, until he agreed
to an out-of-court settlement last month of a key court case that
was pending before the Supreme Court. The case had been viewed by
both sides as a potential vehicle for a majority on the court to
reverse its 16-year-old Roe vs. Wade decision upholding the right
to an abortion.
   ``He obviously betrayed the pro-life people who had supported
him,'' said Darla St. Martin, associate executive director of the
National Right to Life Committee.
   Another key race is for governor of Iowa, a state long
considered conservative on the abortion issue, and where the Senate
race already assures a focus on abortion.
   Miller, the state attorney general, has been running as an
anti-abortion candidate and leads a field of opponents who support
abortion-rights. But in recent weeks he has said he would not seek
any restrictions on abortion, except to support a law requiring
notification of the parent of a minor seeking an abortion.
   Miller is still counted as an abortion opponent. Michelman said
his actions are ``little signals'' that he may be changing.
   ``Tom Miller is feeling the heat,'' she said.
   The winner of the primary will face Republican Gov. Terry
Branstad, who is an abortion opponent.
   Other battles over abortion are shaping up, including potential
gubernatorial primaries in both parties in Connecticut, in
Republican primaries for governor in Massachusetts and Minnesota,
and in the Republican Senate primary in New Hampshire.

<HEAD>Nuclear Weapons Plant Found Unprepared for Radioactive Emergencies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pantex, the country's only final assembly
plant for nuclear bombs and missile warheads, could not respond
effectively to emergency releases of radioactive material,
according to experts who inspected the Texas weapons factory.
   Appointed by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, a ``tiger team''
of government and outside experts found significant health, safety
and environmental deficiencies at the World War II-era plant
outside Amarillo.
   In a memo accompanying the team's draft report, Watkins said the
findings indicate workers lack adequate protection from emergency
and routine exposures to radioactive releases. He said the
situation must be corrected immediately.
   While the team said it found no conditions that appeared ``to
pose a clear and present danger to safety and health ... it was
clear the radiation safety department would be unable to respond
effectively to emergencies involving a release of radioactive
material.''
   Pantex spokesman Tom Walton said some problems already had been
corrected and others were being addressed by plant officials.
   In its report released Wednesday, the team said the radiation
protection program was generally inadequate ``as evidenced by
extensive non-compliance'' with Energy Department regulations.
   The plant's contractor, and DOE offices in Amarillo and
Albuquerque, N.M., have been aware of the situation for several
years ``but little has been achieved to correct it,'' the report
said.
   Although Watkins said the plant has a strong ``safety culture
... little evidence exists that a comparable environmental culture
is evolving. This must be corrected.''
   The report said Pantex is not adequately monitoring its impact
on the underlying Ogallala aquifer, practically the only source of
useable water for Texas' largest irrigated farming region.
   As of August, 11 of the plant's 29 underground storage tank
systems had been leak-tested and five were either leaking or had
leaking pipes. Those systems have been replaced and testing
continues on the remaining systems.
   ``If the failure rate continues to be as high as in the first 11
tank systems tested, there could be substantive on-going releases
to the subsurface environment,'' the report said.
   The plant's procedures for assessing possible contamination of
the air, soil and ground water also do not meet industry standards
and the plant does not have an environmental monitoring plan, said
the team, which was at Pantex from Oct. 2-31.
   Pantex also has failed to ask the Environmental Protection
Agency whether it needs a permit for discharges of contaminated and
potentially contaminated waste water runoff into several playas _
ephemeral desert lakes _ on the grounds of the 16,000-acre plant.
   Samples collected in ditches leading to three of those playas
and in two playas show heavy metal and organic contamination in
water and sediments, the report said.
   Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigators sent
to the plant found more than 300 violations, dozens of them serious.
   In one health violation, records were not maintained on an
employee's exposure to radioactive material during a weapon
teardown operation, or for employees involved in the cleanup.
   Watkins has ordered DOE officials and the plant's contractor,
Mason &amp; Hanger-Silas Mason Co., to address all deficiencies in a
final plan due in February. A formal OSHA report is expected by
mid-January.
   The plant assembles, maintains and repairs nuclear weapons and
manufactures high explosive components.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new U.S. voice that Japan has been hearing for
six months is getting away _ so far _ with saying things the
Japanese don't want to be told.
   U.S. Ambassador Michael H. Armacost hit Tokyo running when he
arrived in May and hasn't cut back on an energetic schedule of
speeches and meetings, in which he offers what he calls ``friendly
advice'' to officials, the media and business leaders.
   His advice, delivered in a voice unexpectedly soft coming from a
6-foot-4-inch man, is couched in careful reason but amounts to a
call for the Japanese to change: change what they say, what they
write in their newspapers, the way they do business, their barriers
to U.S. imports and investment.
   His speeches make news and sometimes invite comparison with his
predecessor, Mike Mansfield, 86, who retired after 11 years as
ambassador. Slowed by illness that required heart surgery in early
1988, Mansfield was far less active in his last years in Tokyo than
Armacost, 34 years his junior, has been.
   Armacost dislikes comparing his performance with Mansfield's.
   ``I have great admiration for him and thought he was a
tremendous ambassador,'' he said in an interview in his ninth-floor
embassy office.
   ``He clearly has helped me because he lent such stature to the
job. So anybody who followed him was bound to be taken more
seriously, at least for a while, because he raised the whole level
of the job.''
   Mansfield sometimes was criticized for not stressing trade
issues enough, while Armacost on arrival declared he was going to
be the embassy's top commercial officer. One of his main goals is
reduction of the $50 billion U.S. annual trade deficit with Japan.
   ``It's not a matter so much of personal interest of the
ambassador, but a matter of the times,'' Armacost said. ``I came
into the job at a time when people back home were experiencing
intense frustration because of the fact that four years of major
adjustments on macro-economic policy had not produced the result
that was expected in our bilateral trade.''
   So he calls on the Japanese to make even more changes, to the
delight of local Americans and even many Japanese who admired
Mansfield for his relentless insistence that the U.S.-Japan
relationship was the most important bilateral tie Washington has.
   Tadashi Yamamoto, president of the Japan Center for
International Exchange, said Mansfield did a good job. ``But
Armacost is younger, he's active and can touch more bases.''
   Yamamoto praised the career diplomat for including the widows of
past Japanese ambassadors to Washington in a recent farewell party
for the new Japanese ambassador. The widows were touched by the
gesture, Yamamoto said.
   Armacost ``can say things which Japanese don't necessarily want
to hear. But also he appears to be very reasonable in many things
he says,'' Yamamoto said.
   Armacost often says that Japan and the United States both will
win by resolving their trade problem.
   ``Trade is not a zero-sum game,'' he says, using a term perhaps
borrowed from his years of teaching government before he went into
the State Department.
   A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Armacost taught at Pomona College
in California, at International Christian University in Tokyo and
at Georgetown University and Johns Hopkins University. In the early
1970s, he was special assistant to Edwin O. Reischauer, then the
U.S. ambassador in Tokyo.
   Armacost was ambassador to the Philippines from 1982 to 1984,
and then was undersecretary of state for political affairs before
President Bush named him to replace Mansfield.
   He says he has been dealing with Japan for 21 years, and when he
declares that Japan and the United States are becoming increasingly
interdependent, he speaks from a family viewpoint as well as an
official one.
   One of his three sons is married to a Japanese and another
attended a university here.
   ``Let me ... offer some friendly advice,'' Armacost said in a
recent speech to a business conference on Japanese investment in
the United States, shortly after U.S. concern accelerated with
Sony's buyout of Columbia Pictures.
   If Japanese investors want to keep a receptive atmosphere in the
United States, Armacost said, they must promote American managers,
hire women and minorities, follow U.S.-style corporate philanthropy
and use local suppliers.
   Most important, Japan must open itself to foreign investment, he
said.
   In almost every area, he said, Japan's performance is lagging.
   And to Japanese commentators who find racism behind Americans'
wariness about Japanese investment, he said, ``That view is
misinformed and, I believe, dangerous, because it deflects
attention from the real sources of concern.''
   He has chided Japanese media _ and American media as well _
about peppering their trade stories with emotive words like ``war''
and ``invasion,'' and he disputes a common Japanese complaint that
U.S. exports to Japan lag because U.S. companies don't try hard.
   ``It's not just a matter of not trying hard,'' he told The
Associated Press. ``Most companies I've run into are trying very
hard and are doing it rather intelligently.
   ``But the fact remains that 20 to 25 percent of the banking
industry in California is owned by the Japanese. I can't think of a
single instance in which an American bank has been able to purchase
a Japanese bank.''
   He said, however, that trade friction ``isn't the whole sum and
substance of the relationship. ... There's a lot in the
relationship that's working well, and it's worth emphasizing from
time to time because it tends to get taken for granted or
forgotten.''
   As examples, he cited Japan's pledge of $150 million in aid to
Poland, helping Mexico and the Philippines deal with massive debts,
growing foreign development aid, heavy financial support for U.S.
military forces in Japan and cooperation with Washington on many
regional problems.

<HEAD>Water Shortages Predicted in US, Other Countries in 1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chronic water shortages may appear during the
1990s from northern China to the western United States, said a
global report on irrigation released Saturday.
   The report _ ``Water for Agriculture: Facing the Limits'' _ said
changes in world temperature almost inevitably will change the
patterns of rain and water supply for several decades.
   That would make it harder for farmers to grow enough food for
the world's rising population, said the author, Sandra Postel, at a
briefing Thursday on the report.
   Postel is vice-president of Worldwatch Institute, a study group
supported by private foundations and United Nations agencies.
   ``Many areas could enter a period of chronic shortages during
the nineties, including northern China, virtually all of northern
Africa, pockets of India, Mexico, much of the Middle East, and
parts of the western United States,'' she wrote.
   ``Where scarcities loom, cities and farms are beginning to
compete for available water; when water supplies tighten, farmers
typically lose out,'' she wrote.
   She quoted one study as showing that global warming in the west
could change the flow of melting snow from the Rocky Mountains,
taking 11 million acres of irrigation.
   Other reasons for shortages include over-pumping of water from
supplies under the surface, poor management of reservoirs and _
most important _ the rapid growth of population the Third World,
she said.
   Her expectation of changes due to global warming was challenged
as speculative by Mark Rosegrant, an irrigation expert at the
International Food Policy Research Institute. He suggested that her
predictions may be too pessimstic.
   In an interview, he suggested that the right policy by
governments, including higher prices for water, could improve water
supplies.
   But he agreed with her that irrigation will not increase much in
the 1990s. He had supplied figures to Postel showing that money
lent to the Third World for irrigation dropped from $1.2 billion in
1975 to about $600 million in 1987.
   Postel cited Egypt, heavily dependent on aid from the United
States and on water from the Nile, as a prime candidate for a
disastrous water shortage that could reduce the already low living
standards of its 55 million people. The Eqyptian population is
increasing at the rate of 1 million every eight months, she added.
   She said a third of the world's food comes from irrigated land
but that environmental damage as well as reduced spending had
slowed the growth of irrigation. Poor management has brought an
accumulation of salt that has damaged roughtly one acre in every
four of irrigated land, she estimated.
   She pointed to the Aral Sea in the Soviet Union, once the
world's fourth biggest body of inland water, saying it had lost
two-thirds of its water and tripled its level of salt,
exterminating all the native fish.
   Recent photographs have shown abandoned fishing boats high on
white salt beaches.

<BYLINE>Cuban Says Changes in East Europe Could Mean US Global Domination
^By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro says his country
will not become an ``appendix of the Yankee empire'' even though
the demise of communist rule in Eastern Europe opens the way to
global U.S. domination.
   Reaffirming his hard-line stance against changes on the other
side of the Atlantic, Castro said Cuba may be assigned the role of
being among the last defenders of socialism.
   Castro delivered the speech Thursday at a ceremony honoring more
than 2,000 Cubans who have died carrying out revolutionary tasks
overseas. A text was made available in the United States.
   Reform of socialist countries is understandable, he said, but he
expressed regret that the changes under way in Eastern Europe
``have a capitalist direction.''
   Capitalism, Castro said, implies ``prostitution, drugs,
gambling, begging, unemployment, abysmal inequality between
citizens'' and other ills.
   With the United States and other capitalist powers showing more
interest in investing in Eastern Europe, ``what resources could the
Third World _ where thousands of millions of people live under
inhuman conditions _ expect from such a development of events?''
Castro asked.
   Comparing the United States with Nazi Germany, Castro said, ``In
a world in which the Yankee empire was able to make a reality of
Hitler's dream of dominating the world, we would know how to defend
this bastion until the last drop of blood.''
   With the demise of like-minded governments in Czechoslovakia,
East Germany, Bulgaria and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Cuba is
among just a handful of states adhering to orthodox communist rule.
   If capitalism returned to Cuba some day, Castro said, the
country's independence and sovereignty would disappear forever.
   ``We would be an extension of Miami, a simple appendix of the
Yankee empire,'' fulfilling the ``disgusting prophesy'' of 19th
century U.S. leaders, he said.
   Castro said much of the wealth of the developed countries comes
from unequal trade with the Third World, and now the United States
wants East European countries to join in this ``colossal looting.''
   ``If events follow their present course ... the bipolarized
world we knew in the post-war era will inevitably become a
unipolarized world under U.S. hegemony,'' he said.
   There is even some sentiment in the Soviet Union, Castro said,
for altering a trade pattern under which Cuba receives above-market
prices for its exports and a discount on some imports.
   He said he banned two Soviet publications this past summer for
recommending that the Soviets sell to Cuba at higher prices and buy
from it at lower ones.
   ``This is exactly the same thing that the United States does
with Third World countries,'' he said, adding that these same
countries face a discouraging future if existing trends are not
reversed.

   East German lawyer and reform activist Gregor
Gysi took over Saturday as Communist Party leader and promised to
change its hard-line, bureaucratic image.
   ``We are no longer going to be just an administrative party,''
Gysi said. ``We are going to be a party of conviction.''
   Gysi, 41, became the youngest leader of a Communist Party in
Eastern Europe and said he had learned something from Western
politics.
   He declined to make any ``pessimistic predictions'' about the
Communists' chances in next year's planned free elections.
   ``We learned from Western politicians that you don't do that,''
said Gysi, who has the smooth, relaxed speaking style and ready
smile of a Western politician. ``You always have to act very
optimistic.''
   Gysi said the party would fight to win in next year's elections
but also would be willing to work in coalition with other parties.
   ``We must naturally make ourselves so trustworthy that for the
others we are seen as having the ability to work in coalition,'' he
said.
   Gysi won with support from 95.3 percent of the 2,714 voting
delegates who took part in the balloting. He was the only candidate.
   His father, Klaus, now in his late 70s, served until last year
as the state secretary for religious affairs in East Germany.
   ``He's a very outspoken person, like his father, maybe that's
why they replaced him as state secretary last year,'' said Irene
Runge, spokeswoman for East Berlin's Jewish Community.
   Gysi's father is Jewish, and Ms. Runge said the new Communist
Party leader had been ``very supportive of the city's Jewish
community.''
   After completing high school Gysi studied law at East Berlin's
Humboldt University. He graduated in 1970, then worked for a year
as a legal assistant.
   In 1971, he began practicing as a defense lawyer dealing
primarily in civil, labor and business cases. He has been chief of
the East Berlin Attorney's Council since 1988 and also served as
the head of East Germany's 15 other attorney boards.
   Most recently, he represented the citizen's initiative New Forum
when the opposition group was seeking official recognition in
October. Authorities at the time declared New Forum illegal and
called members ``enemies of the state.''
   However, Gysi insisted that rejection of New Forum's application
to register as a legal organization violated East German statutes,
and the group was officially recognized in November.
   Following the mass resignation of the Communists' ruling 10-man
Politburo and 163-man Central Committee last week, Gysi was named a
member of a special committee to restructure the shattered party.
   Gysi is an avid supporter of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's glasnost reform policies.
   He is divorced and the father of two children.

   Portable heaters and other supplemental
appliances that are intended to make it cheaper to keep warm can be
very dangerous if improperly used or installed, government experts
say.
   The greatest danger is fire, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission says.
   ``Supplemental home heating appliances are estimated to be
associated with 105,800 residential fires, killing an estimated 600
people in 1987,'' the commission said in a recent statement.
   Comparatively, cooking equipment _ gas and electric stoves and
other items _ accounted for 102,900 home fires and 330 deaths,
according to Elizabeth Johnson, a spokeswoman for the commission.
   Additionally, thousands of injuries from contact burns and about
100 deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning from home heating
appliance emissions occur annually, the commission said.
   Kerosene, gas and electric heaters accounted for more than half
the residential fire deaths due to home heating appliances in 1987.
   Low-income families seem to be common victims of electric heater
fires because ``they're using them as a basic heating system,''
said one CPSC staffer.
   The next greatest threat is from kerosene heaters ``which people
turn to if their power is turned off,'' the staffer said.
   Flare-up or uncontrolled flaming, which can happen when improper
or contaminated fuels are used, is cited as a prime factor in
kerosene-related accidents.
   People should never use gasoline or other fuels in kerosene
heaters.
   Both kerosene and gas heaters emit air pollutants that can build
up to dangerous levels in enclosed rooms. Areas where they are used
should be well ventilated.
   Incorrect setting of the wick in kerosene heaters also can
contribute to escaping pollutants. The CPSC says people should
follow the manufacturer's suggestion on wick settings.
   The agency also says people with older unvented gas-fired space
heaters should replace them with models manufactured after December
1981. That is when they were required to be equipped with sensors
that automatically shut off the heaters if the oxygen levels in the
surrounding area fall too low.
   Fireplaces and wood- and coal-burning stove also are associated
with numerous deaths and thousands of home fires which begin in the
chimney and are often caused by a buildup of creosote, a tar-like
residue.
   Regular service from a qualified chimney sweep can prevent the
buildup. The sweep can also check the structural integrity of both
the fireplace and chimney.
   Experts offer these further tips on heating your home safely:
   _ Follow manufacturers instructions for installation, operation
and maintenance of heating appliances.
   _ Keep children and pets away from heating appliances.
   _ Don't use supplemental heating appliances as a substitute for
a central heating system.
   _ Never use a space heater overnight in a room where you are
sleeping.

   Rebel soldiers Saturday surrendered
their last stronghold and ended their eight-day revolt, the sixth
and bloodiest attempt to oust President Corazon Aquino.
   The military said three brigadier generals and at least 12
middle-grade officers would be relieved of their duties for joining
the coup attempt, which left at least 83 dead and more than 580
wounded.
   In the capital, an assailant hurled a grenade into the main post
office Saturday, killing two people and wounding 18. It was unclear
if the attack was related to the coup attempt.
   About 400 troops had held the Mactan Air Base at Cebu City, 350
miles south of Manila, since the coup attempt began Dec. 1.
   ``Mactan airport in Cebu is now back to normal operations after
the rebel group surrendered to government troops ... this
morning,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a statement.
   `This is good news for our people who have overwhelmingly
demonstrated their abhorrence for the violence espoused by the
mutineers,'' she said, referring to Friday's demonstration in
Manila in support of her government.
   Most of the rebel soldiers who had held the base began leaving
for Mindanao island, where they came from. The rest marched back to
their barracks inside the base, witnesses said. Loyal forces began
clearing the base of booby traps planted by mutineers.
   Brig. Gen. Renato Palma, government regional military chief,
refused to give details of surrender terms but said he will
recommend no charges be brought against the rebel soldiers.
   ``Here in Mactan, not a single shot was fired, so they have not
caused anything ... that will call for serious repercussion,'' he
said. ``I think that is a very good mitigating circumstance. In
other words, we did not fight.''
   Participants in past coups received little or no punishment, and
in one instance mutineers were let off with 30 push-ups.
   Mrs. Aquino was swept into office during the February 1986
``people power'' revolution that forced Ferdinand Marcos into exile
after 20 years in power.
   On Friday, more than 100,000 people gathered in Manila in a show
of support for Mrs. Aquino. During the rally, she hit back at her
chief critic, Vice President Salvador Laurel, and said he ``cannot
wait to be president. I will never give up that position to him.''
   Mrs. Aquino spoke on the site where hundreds of thousands of
Filipinos filled the streets in 1986 to prevent tanks from
attacking dissident officers who had mutinied against Marcos.
   The president did not mention complaints by the rebels and other
critics that she has failed to deliver on promises of social
justice and reform.
   The reported settlement showed just how far both sides softened
to end the revolt.
   On Dec. 2, Mrs. Aquino ruled out negotiations and warned the
mutineers to ``surrender or die.'' But she stepped aside to allow
loyal military commanders to resolve the crisis peacefully.
   Before the surrender, the rebel commander, Brig. Gen. Jose
Commendador, refused to abandon control of the air base, saying his
troops ``have opted to die.''
   The surrender of the Mactan holdouts brought to at least 1,900
the number of rebels in government hands. The military estimates
about 3,000 soldiers joined the coup attempt, and the whereabouts
of many rebels remained unclear.
   Military officials said lower-ranking officers and enlisted men
would be reassigned to other units, as has generally been the case
after previous coup attempts.
   The coup attempt began when rebel forces bombed the presidential
palace and seized several military garrisons near Manila on Dec.1.
   Government forces, backed by U.S. F-4 Phantom fighter jets
flying cover, retook the garrisons. Another rebel group holding out
in Manila's financial district surrendered Thursday.

   Iran began a week of naval maneuvers in
the Persian Gulf on Saturday, and one senior Iranian official said
the war games were the most extensive since the Islamic revolution
10 years ago.
   Iran's state-run radio, monitored in Nicosia, said the air force
and army also would take part in the maneuvers over a ``wide area''
of the gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the strategic Hormuz Strait.
   It said navy destroyers, missile ships, troop carriers,
Hovercraft, air force fighter jets, mine-detecting helicopters and
special Revolutionary Guards naval units were participating.
   A senior Iranian official identified only as Izadi said, ``These
naval maneuvers are the biggest since the victory of the Islamic
revolution in 1979,'' the radio reported.
   The report said Izadi was speaking from a warship participating
in the exercises.
   The maneuvers are code-named Zulfiqar-5 after the legendary
double-edged sword of Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammed. Ali
is revered by Shiite Moslems as a spiritual leader.
   Zulfiqar-5 is ``aimed at coordinating the forces of the Iranian
navy and the Revolutionary Guards, and at upgrading the expert
defense capabilities of the forces in Iranian and international
waters,'' the radio said.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani said last month the navy had
acquired ``vital equipment'' that would improve its capability.
   He did not elaborate. But Western military analysts believe he
may have been indicating that Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship
missiles have been deployed on Iranian warships for the first time.
   The analysts said the Iranian navy has been seeking a new
seaborne missile system.
   The Iranians are believed to have test-fired a ship-borne
Silkworm missile in the Persian Gulf three months ago.
   The maneuvers are the second major naval exercise since last
year's cease-fire in Iran's eight-year war with Iraq. They are the
first since Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader and
chief of the armed forces, dropped Rear Adm. Mohammad-Hussein
Malekzadegan as naval commander last month.
   Malekzadegan had commanded the navy since 1982. Khamenei
replaced him with Ali Shamkhani, who had been minister of the
Revolutionary Guards.
   Since 1979, the Revolutionary Guards have become the biggest
military group in the armed forces, with an estimated 350,000 men
and their own air and naval operations.
   Some Iranian leaders, including Rafsanjani, have sought to merge
the often unruly Revolutionary Guards with the more disciplined
regular armed forces.
   But such a move has been opposed by Khamenei, revolutionary
hard-liners, Guards members and the regular forces themselves.
   Poor coordination, and often open hostility, between the Guards
members and the regular army severely hampered Iran's military
operations during the war with Iraq.
   Shamkhani's appointment, the first involving the transfer of a
Revolutionary Guards commander into the regular forces, was seen as
a move to improve ties between the branches and defuse criticism of
military policy by the Guards.
   Rafsanjani said last month that Shamkhani, who was promoted to
rear admiral, ``is expected to come up with an efficient naval
combination in the gulf'' and improve coordination between naval
and Guards forces.

<HEAD>Pioneer of Action Painting Dead at 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANTIBES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hans Hartung, a German-born artist who
was one of the founders of abstract painting, has died at his home
in the south of France, a friend said. He was 85.
   Hartung died Friday with several friends gathered at his
bedside. The friend who disclosed the death spoke on condition of
anonymity and did not give the cause of death.
   Hartung was a pioneer of action painting, the form of abstract
expressionism born when artists splattered or dripped paint to
create fluid, and seemingly ``impulsive'' compositions.
   French Culture Minister Jack Lang said in a statement that
Hartung was ``a man of creation and freedom,'' and ``one of those
who constructed the new pictorial language of our time.''
   The German-born Hartung lived in France for more than 50 years
and lost a leg fighting for the French in World War II.
   Despite illness and old age, he continued to paint each day,
standing propped up by his assistants.
   He splashed canvases big and small with the pure, bright colors
that had long been his trademark. He was equally at ease with
chalk, ink, watercolors, acrylic and oils.
   Best known for big, bold abstract canvases, Hartung said his
painting was ``impulsive, the expression of deep emotion.''
   ``I paint when I want to convey a certain feeling,'' he said in
a 1984 interview.
   Hartung was born Sept. 21, 1904, in Leipzig, Germany, the son of
a well-to-do doctor who once told him to abandon art if he wanted
to make money.
   He studied philosophy and art history at the University of
Leipzig.
   Hartung came to Paris in 1926 and worked under painter Fernand
Leger. But Hartung struck out on his own when Leger tried to tell
him what to do.
   His approach to abstract art was anything but conventional.
Besides brushes, he liked to use his thumbs, fingernails, hair
brushes, mops, even a sawed-off broom and anything else capable of
spreading paint on canvases that often covered half a wall.
   He was married, divorced and remarried after the war to Anna Eva
Bergman, also a well-known painter.
   Hartung once said his favorite accomplishment was his home _ a
white, Bauhaus-style house-workshop in the hills behind Antibes. He
designed the vast home himself, ``down to the last detail _ no
stairs.''
   He wrote many books, including ``Self-Portrait,'' in 1976. He
was commander of the French Legion of Honor and he earned several
war honors.

   With $15 million spent and no solution in sight,
authorities are thinking of disbanding the Green River Task Force
and say that the elusive serial killer of as many as 49 women may
remain unknown forever.
   Forty to 50 people remain under investigation in the nation's
worst serial murder case. Without some breakthrough, those queries
should be completed in about a year, said King County Police Capt.
Robert Evans, head of the unit.
   The task force was formed in 1984 to probe the deaths or
disappearances of as many as 49 young women, most with links to
prostitution, in the Pacific Northwest from the summer of 1982 to
early 1984. The case takes its name from the river near where the
first five victims were found.
   Police spokesman Dave Robinson said the county alone has spent
some $15 million on the case, which investigators admit could wind
up as much a mystery as the identity of Jack the Ripper, the
unknown person who mutilated and murdered five prostitutes in
London a century ago, or the Zodiac killer who stalked San
Franciscans two decades ago and sent taunting notes to authorities.
   Five months ago, a former law student who was also a prison
escapee was labeled a ``viable suspect'' by investigators. But
William Jay Stevens II, 38, was cleared in the case Nov. 30.
   Other men studied by the task force have not even reached
``viable'' status. For example, a 34-year-old man was arrested Nov.
16 in Vancouver, British Columbia, in a police-style car found to
contain guns, knives, Mace, a machete, 10 feet of rope,
pornographic videos and identification listing eight addresses and
various names. Investigators have speculated that the Green River
killer posed as a police officer to trap his victims.
   But Evans said the man arrested in Canada apparently spent too
little time in the Seattle area to rank higher than ``not very
likely.''
   Evans and Sheriff James Montgomery said the 19-member task force
probably would lose a detective or two next month.
   A budget for 1990 approved by the County Council would cut two
detectives from the major crimes unit, which houses the task force,
and at least one probably will come from the Green River probe,
Montgomery said.
   At its height, the task force had separate offices and involved
about 70 staff members from Seattle, Tacoma, King and Pierce
counties and the FBI.
   While task force members still work almost full-time on Green
River, ``they're awfully close to being melded in (with the major
crimes unit) right now,'' Montgomery said. ``1990 is probably going
to be the transition year.''
   Without significant new leads, he said, ``I think the ability to
specifically identify the task force will disappear,'' probably
after January 1991.
   Besides 41 known Green River victims, the case includes the
disappearance of eight others who fit the victim profile, generally
young and linked to prostitution or other street life.
   ``Murder and prostitution go hand in hand, and they have since
the very beginning of time, I believe,'' Evans said.
   Four were found near Portland, Ore., one not far from Tacoma,
one in a Seattle park and the rest around King County.
   Cause of death was listed as strangling in the first five cases,
but authorities have cited only ``homicidal violence'' since then.
   ``There was clothing found at some of the sites ... but the
absence of clothing is a significant factor at many of the sites,''
Evans said.
   Since the first five bodies were found, most of the remains have
been little more than bones.
   Investigators are even undecided on how many killers were
involved.
   ``I don't think there is a dominant theory,'' Evans said. ``It
could be two, maybe even three, separate serial murder cases.''
   As is customary in widely publicized murder investigations,
authorities have withheld some details of the crimes. Even if the
investigation winds down in coming years, Montgomery said, those
details will remain known only to authorities and the killer.
   ``I don't think it's in the public's best interest, certainly in
the victims' families' best interests, to lay open the entire file
... for the foreseeable future,'' the sheriff said.

<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday flew a jailed
Moslem militant to the city of Srinagar to negotiate the release of
a Cabinet minister's daughter, under death threat from her Moslem
abductors, police sources said.
   Armed gunmen of the Kashmir Liberation Front on Friday kidnapped
Rubaiya Mufti Sayeed, daughter of Home Minister Mufti Mohammed
Sayeed, in Srinagar, a city in Jammu-Kashmir state.
   The front has been fighting since 1965 for the state's secession
from India, saying Jammu-Kashmir's Moslems are discriminated
against by Hindus, a majority in India.
   Sayeed on Tuesday became India's first Moslem home minister. The
appointment was seen as an effort to stem the war in Jammu-Kashmir
and another by Sikhs fighting for autonomy in Punjab state.
   Police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
government flew Mohammed Akram, a top militant of the front, from
Jammu to Srinagar to establish contact with his organization and
negotiate the woman's freedom.
   Akram was captured two weeks ago and jailed at Jammu, 95 miles
south of Srinagar.
   He was accompanied by a police team that will remain with him
until contact is established with the kidnappers, the sources said.
   Moosa Raza, the state's top government official, told reporters
that ``non-political and non-government people have initiated the
process of negotiations.'' He refused to name them.
   The United News of India news agency, quoting unnamed sources,
said government agents had met with the militants. The report could
not be immediately confirmed.
   The kidnappers threatened to kill Miss Sayeed if five jailed
front militants are not freed by Monday. It also threatened to
kidnap police officers' relatives if the demands are not met.
   Officials said the government of Prime Minister V.P. Singh, who
took office a week ago, on Saturday flew commandos to Srinagar. The
commandos were asked to stand by.
   Miss Sayeed, a 22-year-old medical student and intern at a
Srinagar hospital, was kidnapped on her way home from work Friday
afternoon.
   Members of the front later telephoned her home and demanded the
release of the five militants as ransom.
   In the statement delivered to Srinagar newspapers, the front
demanded the release of Abdul Hami Sheikh, a top leader of the
group. Sheikh was arrested last month after a clash with police.
   The four other militants the front wants released are Noor
Mohammed Kalwal, Mohammed Altaf, Javed Ahmed Zargar and Sher
Mohammed Azad.
   Sayeed met reporters in his New Delhi office on Saturday. ``I am
in touch with developments,'' he said.
   As home minister, he is in charge of police and internal
security.
   The kidnapping came a day after Sayeed was appointed head of a
government committee set up to solve the disputes in Jammu-Kashmir
and Punjab.
   After taking office Dec. 2, Singh appeared on national
television and vowed to reconcile regional conflicts.
   Sayeed's appointment to the key home ministry post was seen as
an effort to help ease tensions between Hindus and Moslems in the
country.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
Militants claim it should be an independent nation or part of
Islamic Pakistan.
   Moslems make up 64 percent of the state but nationwide they form
only 11 percent of the population. Hindus comprise 80 percent of
India's 880 million people.

   Several hundred people gathered Saturday to
commemorate two sea battles that underlined the importance of the
Falkland Islands as a major South Atlantic base for the Royal Navy
in two world wars.
   The veterans and survivors marched past the Cenotaph memorial to
Britain's war dead to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of
the Falkland Islands in World War I and the 50th anniversary of the
Battle of the River Plate in World War II.
   Wreaths were laid by Admiral of the Fleet Sir Edward Ashmore,
Lewis Clifton, the Falkland Islands government representative in
London, and Des Keoghane, of the Falkland Islands Families
Association.
   The guests included Marion McLeod, now in her 90s, who alerted
the navy on the morning of Dec. 8, 1914 that a fleet of German
warships was off the Falklands. Less than two hours later, a
British squadron put to sea and by that evening all but one of the
German ships had been sunk.
   Twenty-five years later, the German battleship Graf von Spee was
marauding in the South Atlantic, sinking ships.
   The British South American Squadron believed the ship would
sooner or later try to find new prizes in the mouth of the River
Plate on the east coast of the continent.
   Three light cruisers, HMS Ajax, Exeter and Achilles, sailed from
the Falkland Islands capital of Port Stanley on Dec. 9, 1939 and
arrived off the River Plate on Dec. 12. The Graf Spee arrived on
Dec. 13 and in furious battle was damaged and fled to Montevideo,
Uruguay.
   The British squadron blocked the port. Trapped, the German
skipper scuttled the Graf Spee and committed suicide in Buenos
Aires three days later. The British ships returned to the Falklands
in time for Christmas.
   Argentina calls them the islands the Malvinas and claims them.
It tried unsucessfully in 1982 to take them over.

<TEXT>
   An Iranian-backed fundamentalist group
linked to the holding of Western hostages said Saturday it had
thwarted an attempt to assassinate its mentor.
   A car rigged with 200 pounds of TNT was parked off the road that
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah takes daily from his house to Beir
el-Abed mosque in Beirut's southern slums, said a statement by
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Police said the bomb-laden car was set to be detonated by remote
contol. They said they could not confirm it was intended to kill
Fadlallah.
   The bomb was safely defused in the car, which was parked in
front of a bank about 100 yards from the mosque and 1.2 miles from
the Shiite Moslem cleric's house in Haret Hreik district, the
statement said.
   Fadlallah, 54, is the spiritual guide of Hezbollah, believed to
be the umbrella of Shiite extremist factions holding most of the 18
Western hostages, including eight Americans, in Lebanon.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   There was no indication who might have engineered the bombing
attempt.
   It was reported shortly after a cease-fire halted 24 hours of
street battles between Hezbollah and the mainstream Shiite Amal
militia in which police said 13 people were killed and 22 wounded.
   Assassinations by car bombs or bomb blasts have long been a
byproduct of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   The latest was the remote-controlled bomb that killed President
Rene Mouawad and 23 others in Moslem West Beirut Nov. 22, just 17
days after his election. No one claimed responsibility.
   Mouawad was elected as part of an Arab League-sponsored pact
aimed at ending the war. His election was opposed by the country's
Christian leader and army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, because the
pact does not provide a timetable for the removal of Syrian troops
from Lebanon.
   The Syrians were deployed here in 1976 under a peackeeping
mandate. Aoun said they violated the mandate by siding with the
Moslems in the war.

   Former television evangelist Jim Bakker
won't be doing any pastoral work at a federal prison where he has
been assigned to do janitorial work for 11 cents an hour.
   The PTL founder is among 26 orderlies in charge of cleaning the
residence hall in which Bakker and other prisoners live, said John
Chreno, spokesman at the Federal Medical Center, a prison-hospital.
   The assignment became permanent Thursday after Bakker had worked
temporarily in the position for about 2{ weeks, Chreno said. Bakker
has not commented on his assignment, he said.
   Bakker, who was convicted in October of defrauding followers of
the former PTL ministry of $3.7 million, was transferred to the
Rochester prison Nov. 3.
   The Federal Bureau of Prisons has a policy of not permitting
prisoners to perform religious services or other types of pastoral
work. Three full-time chaplains are on staff at the Rochester
prison.

   Singer Olivia Newton-John's neighbors are
anything but mellow over the new home she and her husband are
building, complaining that tons of dirt from a seawall are being
dumped onto the beach.
   Miss Newton-John, whose hits include ``Have You Never Been
Mellow,'' is having the seawall built for her 6,000-square-foot
home under construction in this exclusive seaside enclave.
   Residents said that some of the sand and dirt has washed into
the ocean, turning the water beside their expensive beachfront
properties a murky brown.
   ``If we get a heavy rain or the tide rises high enough, her
front yard is going to be in my front yard,'' said Gretchen Buck,
who lives a few hundred feet down the beach from the singer's
property.
   The California Coastal Commission says it is investigating the
matter.
   ``I know it looks like a mess, but we intend to do everything in
our power to make amends with the neighbors if anyone has been
offended,'' said the Australian-born singer's husband, Matt
Lattanzi.
   Miss Newton-John declined comment on the matter.
   The singer has long been an outspoken advocate for environmental
causes, including efforts to protect whales and to save Brazilian
rain forests.
   ``Neither of us would knowingly do anything to harm the
coastline,'' Lattanzi said. ``She would cringe to think that anyone
could think she would condone damaging the environment.''

   William Clay Ford Jr. wasn't content to ride on
his name alone as head of Ford Motor Co.'s heavy truck engineering

   Ford, 32, a great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford,
returned to Michigan last May after two years as chairman of Ford's
Switzerland subsidiary. He earned his state chauffeur's license
after six hours at the wheel of a tractor-trailer at the Ford
proving ground in suburban Romeo.
   ``At least now I have a skill I can use ...,'' Ford said. ``Some
of the people (in the heavy truck division) who'd been there for
years didn't know how to drive a truck.''
   Not that the training was easy. The state examiner told him to
back the tractor-trailer through a truck stop. But, Ford said, ``I
almost took the whole truck stop with me.''

   Ronald Reagan startled shoppers as he
strolled through a shopping mall, buying stuffed toys for poor
children and even a few treats for himself.
   The former president stopped to shake hands, nuzzle infants and
sign autographs as he meandered through Century City Mall on Friday.
   With his half-dozen Secret Service agents leading the way, he
journeyed to a candy store to buy a 5-pound box of chocolates for
the White House switchboard operators. There was a 9-inch chocolate
Santa for Nancy, too.
   ``I like everything about Christmas,'' Reagan said when asked if
he enjoyed shopping after eight years of security-minded
limitations. ``There were a lot of restrictions before.''
   At one stop, the 78-year-old Reagan bought three golf balls and
stuffed Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and Winnie the Pooh.
   ``It's just a mission for the kids,'' Reagan said. ``There are
programs that are seeing that tots get toys who otherwise might not
get them. Mine here are two for the Marines and one for the Highway
Patrol.
   ``And I thought it wouldn't hurt if I bought those three golf
balls for myself.''

   Donald Trump is sending his recruiters to
Indiana next month to seek workers for his newest Atlantic City
casino and to build an employment pool for potential casinos in
Gary.
   The plan is the first indication Trump is casting his eye on
northwestern Indiana, whose push for casino gambling will shift
next month to the Legislature, which must approve legislation
permitting gambling in Gary.
   Trump will open his Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City next spring.
   ``We're looking for qualified people in Gary who want to work at
the Taj Mahal to learn the gaming industry in case the gaming
industry comes to Gary,'' said Robert Trump, Donald's brother and
head of the recruitment effort.
   ``It's a win-win situation.''
   Trump had opposed creating casino gambling in Gary before the
city's residents voted in favor of casinos in a non-binding
referendum on Nov. 4.
   ``We understand it was strictly a business statement,''
reflecting a desire not to increase competition, said Karen
Williams, a spokeswoman for Gary Mayor Thomas Barnes.
   The city has been told Trump's recruiters will seek to hire as
many as 500 people from the area for the new 1,250-room hotel
casino, Williams said. More than 6,000 people will work at the
resort.
   Six other successful casino operators in Nevada and New Jersey
have expressed interest in Gary. They are Golden Nugget, Circus
Circus, the Sands, Bally's, Harrah's and Resorts International.

<HEAD>Trial Offers Intriguing Glimpse Into Defense Industry</HEAD>

   The trial of a former Boeing Co.
marketing executive offers an intriguing glimpse into an
``old-boy'' network of defense contractors in which classified
documents were freely swapped, no questions asked.
   During three days of testimony last week, witnesses spun tales
that could have come right out of a spy novel: car trunks stuffed
with documents; shadowy figures who may have sold the documents;
secret stashes; and document destruction _ sometimes in home
fireplaces.
   The swapping of documents during the late 1970s and 1980s was
described as ``endemic'' and ``common'' and there was an ``unspoken
agreement'' that no one questioned where the documents came from,
not even Pentagon investigators.
   One witness said he was under pressure from his boss to secure
the documents and others said their companies felt they had a
``need to know'' what was in the documents.
   Most of those involved in the document ring were former military
officers who had served in the Pentagon prior to going to work for
defense contractors.
   Prosecutors described Richard Lee Fowler, who worked for Boeing
from 1978 until he was fired in 1986 after an investigation was
begun, as the ``linchpin'' of a document trading ring that involved
employees of nine major defense contractors.
   After deliberating only two hours, a federal court jury
convicted Fowler on 39 counts arising from his possession of the
secret budget documents. Boeing earlier had pleaded guilty to
receiving classified documents and agreed to pay $5.2 million in
fines.
   Henry Hudson, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of
Virginia, refused to comment after the trial on whether such
practices continue in the defense community, but he did indicate
there were ongoing investigations.
   Hudson said Fowler's trial ``sends a clear message it won't be
tolerated.''
   The documents were known as ``planning, programming and budget
system documents'' and included detailed budget information for
projects such as the Strategic Defense Initiative, long-range
ballistic missiles, AWACS aircraft, military satellite
communications and expendable launch vehicles.
   Former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, along with two former
Pentagon comptrollers, a military adviser to former President
Reagan and a string of generals, testified that the documents were
never intended for release to defense contractors.
   One general said the contractors had broken the ``rules of
engagement'' by getting the documents and another said the
documents provided the contractors with a ``significant advantage''
because it gave them a road map to future military spending plans.
   But despite testimony that everyone knew the documents were
off-limits to contractors, they often were on the street within a
day after being finalized.
   Fowler regularly logged the documents into the classified
document log at Boeing's office in Rosslyn, Va., just outside
Washington. During the eight years he worked for Boeing those logs
were inspected at least 13 times by Defense Investigative Service
inspectors.
   ``The generals said that everyone knew the documents were
restricted, but the exception apparently was the trained
bloodhounds of DIS,'' John Bray, Fowler's attorney, said during
closing arguments.
   Bray insisted throughout the trial that the only reason Fowler
was prosecuted was because he refused to give investigators the
names of his Pentagon sources.
   Bray also argued that the Defense Department's industrial
security manual was unclear and confusing as to the release and
handling of the documents.
   Testimony indicated that employees from Boeing, Honeywell,
Bendix, RCA, IBM, Gruman, Raytheon, Rockwell and Martin Marietta
were involved in exchanging documents.
   Some witnesses said they knew they shouldn't have had the
documents, while others insisted they had followed proper
procedures in getting them.
   The documents were important when contractors were trying to
decide whether to pump millions of their own dollars into
developing projects that the Pentagon may or may not go forward
with.
   One witness said the documents let the contractors know just how
serious the government was about pursuing a project.
   No one alleged during the trial that the documents were stolen
in ``some midnight, black-bag job at the Pentagon.''
   Bray said Fowler refused to give the investigators the names of
his sources because he knew ``they would be goners.''

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of American congressman took chisels
and hammers in hand Saturday to chip away chunks of the Berlin Wall.
   ``We're all getting a piece of the wall,'' said Rep. Mike Espy,
D-Miss., part of a six-member congressional delegation visiting
Berlin.
   A small crowd of smiling but puzzled Germans and several
uniformed West Berlin police looked on, shaking their heads.
   ``You're looking for the U.S. group. Would you believe they're
over there breaking down the wall?'' one policeman told a reporter
helplessly.
   The delegation, led by Maryland Democrat Steny H. Hoyer, met
with East Germany's interim President Manfred Gerlach a day earlier.
   Other members of the delegation included Reps. Martin Frost,
D-Texas; E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla.; Lawrence Smith, D-Fla.; and
Benjamin Cardin, D-Md.
   On Saturday, they visited the West Berlin side of the wall at
Potsdamer Platz, just a few minutes' walk from Brandenburg Gate. A
couple of them chipped away pieces of the cement barrier for
souvenirs.
   As the chipping continued, with Espy energetically flailing at
the wall with hammer and chisel, spraying bits of cement all over
the place, Hoyer spoke about the group's earlier visit in East
Berlin.
   Turning around to look back to where Espy was banging away at
the wall, Hoyer said, ``The status of Berlin was not discussed by
us in any depth. But it will be much more open. The breaking of the
wall is a symbol of that.''
   During the talks, Gerlach told the delegation he thinks Soviet
troops based in East Germany could be withdrawn soon, Hoyer said.
   ``He didn't give a real timetable for the withdrawal, but did
mention in two to three years,'' Hoyer said.
   The Soviet Union has about 400,000 troups based in East Germany,
while the U.S. forces in West Germany number about 250,000.
   East German deputy Foreign Minister Ernst Krabatsch, who also
met with the delegation, said he expects the United States to
withdraw some of its forces.
   The talks only lightly touched on discussion of reunification of
the two German states, he said.
   ``We got the feeling that even the opposition (in East Germany)
is worried about how capitalism would be for the poor,'' Hoyer said.
   East Germany's social net is aimed at ensuring cradle-to-grave
security for its citizens, with everyone supposedly gainfully
employed.
   Hoyer said he sees no precedent for what the East Germans have
in mind for establishing a new political system, something between
communism and capitalism where ``there's no real model for them to
follow.''
   ``The East Germans are in a transitional period,'' he added.
``It will take time for them to master the situation.''
   ``Most of the people we talked to said the borders won't change,
and I'm talking about (East Germany's) border with Poland, but the
wall will go, only a few pieces will remain as a reminder,'' Hoyer
predicted.

   A private plane crashed shortly after
taking off Saturday morning from an airfield, killing the pilot,
his son and two other passengers, police said.
   The pilot, Mark A. O'Donnell, 40, of Fenton, died at 8:35 a.m.
at McLaren General Hospital in Flint, about two hours after his
single-engine Cessna 172 crashed in a cornfield, said state police
Sgt. Pat Darrow.
   His son, Mark E. O'Donnell, 10; Richard Maser, 42, of Fenton;
and Charles Lawrence, 54, of Corinth, Miss., died instantly, Darrow
said.
   The plane had taken off from Price Airport in Linden, about 25
miles southwest of Flint, and was bound for Bowling Green, Ohio,
before continuing to Corinth, Darrow said.
   The plane crashed at 6:30 a.m. about one-half mile west of the
runway, Darrow said. O'Donnell's wife discovered the wreckage, he
said.
   Federal authorities would investigate the crash, Darrow said.

<HEAD>Apartheid Foes Gather for Largest Conference Ever</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 4,500 activists
Saturday opened the largest-ever anti-apartheid conference with
hopes of finding new tactics to topple the white minority
government.
   Black, white, Indian and mixed-race members of about 2,100
organizations _ some of them ideological rivals in past years _
filled a university hall for the Conference for a Democratic Future.
   ``The regime ... has done its utmost to break us: whipping our
people, declaring the states of emergency, assassinating and
detaining our leaders,'' said the keynote speaker, African National
Congress leader Walter Sisulu. ``It has failed. We gather here in
greater numbers than ever before.''
   Meanwhile, in Boksburg, an industrial city near Johannesburg,
police used tear gas to break up clashes between white extremists
and scores of mixed-race people who came to picnic at a whites-only
park. Ten people were arrested, police said.
   Boksburg has been beset by racial tension since far-right
candidates won control of the municipal council last year. Civic
leaders in Rieger Park, Boksburg's mixed-race neighborhood,
organized the picnic to protest alleged assaults on mixed-race
women by members of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
   The government chose to allow the anti-apartheid conference even
though many participants belong to groups banned under terms of the
3{-year-old state of emergency. A similar conference was prohibited
last year shortly before it was to open.
   The agenda for this year's gathering included plans for mass
protests and the possible formation of a new organization
encompassing all the participating groups. Decisions reached at the
conference were expected to be announced Sunday.
   ``Your diversity is our strength,'' Sisulu said. ``The gigantic
task of this conference is to confirm the crucial importance of
unity, and to plan a program of mass action ... that will challenge
the apartheid state.''
   Sisulu, 77, was freed unconditionally in October by President
F.W. de Klerk after 26 years in prison. But Sisulu had no praise
for the president or the white-controlled government's offer to
negotiate some form of black political rights that stops short of
majority rule.
   ``Mr. de Klerk, your back is to the wall,'' Sisulu said. ``Come
stand on the floor of a conference like this. ... Submit to the
processes of democracy.''
   Sisulu acknowledged that de Klerk, during four months in power,
has moved faster toward reform than his predecessors. ``But we know
he has limits beyond which he will not go,'' Sisulu said.
   ``We reiterate our commitment to one person, one vote ... as the
non-negotiable principle on which a future South Africa will be
built,'' he said.
   De Klerk has said he supports giving South Africa's 28 million
blacks some form of power but not the concept of one person, one
vote. The nation's 5 million whites control the economy and the
government.
   Observers from 19 countries were present, including Norway's
deputy foreign minister, Knut Wollenback, and a Soviet professor,
Irina Filatova. It was the first time in decades that a Soviet
attended an opposition meeting here, and she was cheered loudly
during brief remarks to the crowd.
   Also granted observer status was the anti-apartheid Democratic
Party, which some blacks reject because it holds seats in South
Africa's white-controlled Parliament.
   Full-fledged delegates included white civil rights activists,
black businessmen, and anti-apartheid politicians from the
semi-autonomous black homelands.
   Black groups espousing the so-called Africanist philosophy _
which views South African whites as settlers who should be ousted _
rejected invitations to attend. Africanist leaders said they were
excluded from planning the conference and that they opposed the
inclusion of the Democratic Party and the homeland parties.
   Also absent was Inkatha, the 1.5-million member Zulu
organization. Inkatha opposes militant forms of protest but has
been feuding violently with groups aligned with the African
National Congress.
   Thus, most of the participants shared to some degree the general
policies of the ANC, which espouses a non-racial philosophy and has
said it would negotiate with the government if certain
pre-conditions were met.
   The bid for unity did receive a boost through the participation
of the Black Consciousness Movement, which in the past has opposed
the ANC's non-racial approach.

   Alan Cranston strides into the mayor's
crowded office, flashing a smile and shaking hands, looking more
like a confident Senate leader than a politician in deep trouble.
   But the 75-year-old Cranston, a virtual institution in a state
not known for cultural or political permanence, faces the most
serious crisis of his career as federal agents and a Senate ethics
committee investigate whether he improperly intervened with
government regulators in the failure of Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   On Friday, a Los Angeles Times statewide survey of 2,046 voters
reported that Cranston's image had nosedived, with 58 percent of
those polled saying they had an unfavorable impression of the
senator.
   In October, before the scandal had begun to snowball, a similar
poll reported Cranston had a 56 percent favorable rating.
Nonetheless, other recent polls have shown the senator holding his
own among voters.
   Cranston, the majority whip and the Senate's No. 2 Democrat,
told a Los Angeles news conference Friday that the Times' latest
poll was the result of ``bad press and wild charges.''
   He also said _ again _ that he will seek a fifth term in 1992,
responding to a fellow Democrat, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who urged
Cranston to consider not running.
   ``From everything I know about Alan Cranston, he will be a
candidate in 1992,'' said Darry Sragow, who managed Cranston's
successful campaign against Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ed Zschau
in 1986. ``This (Lincoln) won't stop him.''
   But others aren't so sure.
   The Senate ethics committee, with an independent prosecutor, is
investigating allegations that Cranston and four other senators
improperly intervened with federal officials 2{ years ago when they
wanted to shut down Lincoln Savings and Loan, the Irvine-based
thrift.
   Lincoln was finally taken over this year, and it is estimated
the move will cost taxpayers up to $2 billion, possibly the most
expensive thrift institution failure in the nation's history.
   In addition, some 23,000 Lincoln customers bought $250 million
in worthless bonds, purchases which critics say could have been
avoided if government regulators had closed the thrift down at the
time.
   For the past two weeks, the senator has crisscrossed the state
in a whirlwind, campaign-style tour from the far north to San Diego.
   The visits include town hall meetings on crime prevention,
fund-raisers to tap wealthy farmers and meetings with local
officials who hope the lawmaker can cut red tape on federal
earthquake relief. It was such a visit that brought him to this
quake-shaken city last week.
   Cranston's office said the senator had scheduled 37 events
between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15. That kind of heavy scheduling rivals
Cranston's calendar during his 1986 campaign.
   To repeated questions about whether his schedule was prompted by
his problems with Lincoln, Cranston has replied that he is taking
advantage of the Senate holiday recess to handle constituent needs,
especially in light of the October earthquake in the Bay area.
   Responding to questions about his role in the burgeoning scandal
surrounding the collapse of Lincoln Savings and his relationship to
Lincoln's high-spending owner, Charles H. Keating Jr., Cranston
says that he has done nothing wrong, that he only asked federal
officials to expedite their decision-making.
   ``For God's sake, if a senator is not supposed to speak to
regulators who are on somebody's back, and seek to make sure they
are being treated fairly, and to end the process, what is a senator
supposed to do?'' Cranston recently told the San Jose Mercury News.
   Thus far, many people appear to believe him.
   ``He's honest and he's smart. It's a lot of media hype,'' said
Sandy Smith, 28, an Oakland woman who happened to be in the city
hall vicinity at the time of Cranston's visit. In Azusa, before
another meeting, smiling high school students waved to Cranston and
asked to have their pictures taken with him.
   But Cranston received $47,000 in campaign donations from Keating
and solicited $850,000 from Keating on behalf of three tax-exempt
voter registration groups, including one headed by his son Kim.
   On top of the Lincoln savings probe, Cranston must deal with
reports that FBI agents and the Internal Revenue Service are
studying the voter registration organizations to find out whether
they attempted to register more Democrats than Republicans, a
violation for such tax-exempt groups.
   ``It makes my blood boil,'' Cranston told a Los Angeles news
conference last week.
   ``It began as a story about five senators in Washington and it
is rapidly becoming a story about a failure to act in Sacramento,''
said Sragow, who currently manages former San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein's run for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination
next year.
   The other U.S. senators being probed are John McCain, R-Ariz.;
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., John Glenn, D-Ohio; and Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   State authorities also are investigating Lincoln's collapse,
trying to determine whether California regulators _ appointees of
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian _ were pressured by Keating's
largess to go easy on Lincoln.
   Keating, his companies or his associates donated at least
$150,000 to Deukmejian's political campaign.

<HEAD>Mayoral Honeymoon? Forget About It</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Before Mayor-elect David Dinkins named a police
commissioner or a sanitation chief, he hired a criminal defense
lawyer.
   Dinkins, who becomes New York City's first black mayor in three
weeks, hasn't had much time to enjoy his Nov. 7 election. There was
a celebration, followed by a vacation in Puerto Rico, followed by a
federal investigation into a stock deal with his son.
   Cancel those honeymoon plans.
   ``As a matter of fact, the absence of a honeymoon may have a
silver lining because no matter what happens, how bad can it be?
Look what I've been through,'' Dinkins said last week.
   How bad can it get? One columnist wrote of an ``Eddie II''
scenario, in which Dinkins resigns and the current mayor, Edward I.
Koch, wins a special election. Dinkins had dashed Koch's hopes for
a fourth term by beating him in the September Democratic primary.
   Another columnist, Jimmy Breslin, likened Dinkins to a
horseplayer who holds a winning ticket, only to see his number
flashing on the parimutuel board, indicating an inquiry.
   Around City Hall, City Council President Andrew Stein, next in
line should a mayor step down, is jokingly called Mayor-Elect-Elect
Stein.
   All this may seem a bit harsh, since Dinkins' finances were
picked over quite thoroughly during the campaign, especially by his
opponent, former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani. And still, Dinkins
won.
   So what's the fuss?
   ``No law has been violated by David Dinkins or his son,'' said
his lawyer, Charles Stillman. ``This is a simple transaction
between a father and son that has been blown out of proportion.''
   Others say it wasn't so simple.
   Dinkins acquired stock in 1972 in a fledgling company, Inner
City Broadcasting Corp. The company prospered, and in 1985 when
Dinkins became Manhattan borough president, he transfered the stock
to his son, David Jr.
   He told a newspaper in 1986 that it was a gift, and his failure
to file a federal gift tax return became a campaign issue this
year. In response, he produced a handwritten note from his son,
dated 1985, which said the stock was sold for $58,000 plus
interest, due in 1991.
   Investigators are analyzing the paper and ink in the note to try
to determine when it was written.
   And if it was a sale, it wasn't listed on his city financial
disclosure forms.
   Dinkins' son and the president of Inner City refuse to reveal
stock certificates or other documents that might prove when the
stock was transferred.
   Another twist: Before selling it for $58,000, Dinkins valued the
stock at $1 million on a state form. He said the value was an
estimate of what the company would bring if broken up and sold;
$58,000 was the market value.
   None of which helps a man who had to listen to campaign-trail
reminders that he didn't file tax returns from 1969-72.
   Dinkins defeated one federal prosecutor, Giuliani, only to find
another, U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney, looking into his affairs.
   Stillman has called the investigation ``Rudy Giuliani's last
hurrah,'' though Giuliani denies having anything to do with the
investigation by Maloney. Maloney is based in Brooklyn, while
Giuliani's base as U.S. attorney was Manhattan.
   At most of his public appearances, the mayor-elect is greeted by
reporters with questions. Dinkins' famed patience is wearing thin,
though he says, ``I recognize that when you seek or hold public
office there seems to be a new set of rules.''
   Meanwhile, other problems cropped up:
   _The city Department of Investigation is investigating his votes
on cable television franchises when he was borough president. The
DOI is also looking into the stock deal.
   _Newspapers carried stories pointing out that he had not named
his Cabinet as quickly as other mayors had; Dinkins deflected some
of that by appointing eight top aides Friday.
   _His new press secretary, Pulitzer Prize-winner Albert Scardino,
admitted having given Dinkins advice during the campaign while
still working at The New York Times, contrary to the newspaper's
policy.
   And in the background is Giuliani, now a private citizen but
occasionally in the public eye. He suggested that the city unite
behind the mayor-elect.
   But he repeated something from the campaign, that ``it would be
very, very difficult for a mayor, or a prospective mayor, to take
on the responsibilities of government if he were under
investigation.''
   Just how difficult may be seen shortly.

   The leaders of the European Community
said Saturday they support the reunification of East Germany and
West Germany but that other European borders must remain untouched.
   The 12-member EC announced its support after West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Bonn would not try to reclaim
territories the German states held before World War II.
   ``We have a responsibility toward our neighbors. We want to do
nothing destabilizing,'' Kohl said as the EC completed a two-day
summit in this French city on the German border.
   Eventual reunification seems possible in light of the political
upheaval in Communist East Germany. But the prospect has raised
fears that a large German state would upset the political and
economic balance in Europe. Bonn's powerhouse economy already
dominates the European Community.
   ``I am not afraid of reunification,'' said French President
Francois Mitterrand. ``I consider it to be legitimate.''
   But he also said countries must abide by international treaties
and other obligations ``unless they are prepared to create
dangerous and unnecessary tensions.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who failed to slow
the EC's drive toward European economic integration, still praised
the outcome of the summit.
   Despite their disagreements, she said, the leaders showed they
``can act as the driving force for the development of the whole of
Europe at a turning point in the continent's history.''
   Added Mitterrand: ``Henceforth there is no longer a Europe in
two parts, acting in the shadows or at the initative of the two
superpowers.''
   The 12 leaders issued a joint statement that said: ``We seek the
strengthening of the state of peace in Europe in which the German
people will regain its unity through free self-determination.
   ``This process should take place peacefully and democratically.''
   Reunification also should occur, the statement said, in the
context of the 1975 Helsinki accords on European cooperation and
security, which permanently fixed postwar borders.
   The wording of the statement was agreed to after Dutch Prime
Minister Ruud Lubbers and Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti
pressed Kohl at a dinner Friday night for his definition of
reunification.
   Belgian and Dutch sources, demanding anonymity, said Kohl made
clear that reunification applied only to the two existing German
nations and not to German-speaking areas in neighboring countries.
   Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said it was ``the most
tense moment'' of an otherwise low-key summit.
   In their final statement, the leaders said they had no intention
of taking advantage of the upheavals in communist Eastern Europe.
They promised to build up the weakened economies of emerging
democracies and agreed to set up a European development bank to
help.
   The EC ``remains the cornerstone of a new European architecture
and ... a mooring for a future European equilibrium,'' the
statement said.
   Overriding Mrs. Thatcher's objections, the other 11 leaders
agreed to hold a special conference next December in Italy to
rewrite parts of their founding Treaty of Rome.
   The changes would be needed to carry out a sweeping plan for
economic and monetary union that would lead to a common European
currency and system of central banks. Any treaty revisions would
require unanimous approval.
   Mrs. Thatcher objected to monetary integration, saying it would
rob member countries of sovereign rights to decide national
economic policy.
   She also was alone in opposing the summit's adoption of a
``social charter'' on employment and other worker rights. Mrs.
Thatcher said the non-binding charter would increase unemployment,
raise costs and make EC goods less competitive.
   Common Market members are Britain, Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal
and Greece.

   The Communist Party is willing to surrender its
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power, the party's chief
ideologue said Saturday after a meeting of the policy-making
Central Committee.
   Vadim A. Medvedev also said the party is prepared to change its
status as it moves away from day-to-day management of all aspects
of Soviet life.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's political reforms have outpaced
the 1977 Soviet constitutional provision, Article 6, that makes the
20-million-member party the guiding force in Soviet society,
Medvedev told reporters.
   ``In general terms, we are not clinging to Article 6 in the form
in which it is included in the constitution,'' Medvedev said. ``It
is not our point that it must be kept there at any cost.''
   The debate over the party's role reflects a building debate in
the Soviet Union following fast-moving reforms in Eastern Europe,
where Hungary has dropped the name Communist from the party's name
and is preparing for multiparty elections; Poland has installed a
non-Communist prime minister; and Czechoslovakia and East Germany
have repealed the Communists' monopoly on power.
   On Thursday, Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to drop
a constitutional guarantee of Communist power and approve a
multiparty system.
   The 250-member Central Committee elevated the new party chief of
the Ukraine, Vladimir Ivashko to membership on the ruling
Politburo. It also named the recently appointed editor of Pravda,
Ivan Frolov, to the Secretariat, which handles the day-to-day
running of party business, and discussed preparations for this
week's reconvening of the Soviet Congress.
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and several other
members of the Congress of People's Deputies have called a brief
general strike Monday to show popular support for removing the
party clause from the constitution.
   Medvedev, echoing a policy announced more than a year ago by
Gorbachev, said the party's goal is to ``move away from being the
guiding nucleus of the whole government structure to becoming a
political vanguard.''
   For more than seven decades, the party has dictated everything
from the direction of Soviet foreign policy to how much collective
farms should produce and how much state stores charge for a bar of
soap.
   ``Some of the wording of the current Article 6 clashes with new
plans for the party's development,'' Medvedev said.
   The wide debate in Soviet society over changing the party's
legal status _ once an unthinkable topic for public debate here _
was not ``a taboo subject,'' he said.
   However, he accused Sakharov of unethnical conduct for calling a
general strike.
   ``We do not have to act under the pressure of emotion,''
Medvedev said. ``We do not need an approach to the constitution
that would focus on just one article without suggesting anything in
the way of replacement.''
   He denounced what he called attempts to use the debate to fuel
``political speculation'' that would damage the party.
   Medvedev said remarks at the plenary session by Gorbachev on the
party's constitutional status would be printed in the state-run
press on Sunday.
   Ivashko was promoted to the Politburo, succeeding his
predecessor, long-time Ukrainian party boss Vladimir V.
Shcherbitsky, who was retired at the last Central Committee meeting
in September.
   Two newly named party chiefs in Moscow and Leningrad, the
country's two largest cities, failed to win seats on the party's
ruling body in contrast to longstanding practice.
   However, Medvedev said Boris Gidaspov of Leningrad and Yuri
Prokofiev of Moscow had been named to the newly created party
bureau for the Russian federation, which will be chaired by
Gorbachev and provide a separate party leadership for the country's
largest republic.
   As often happens before such plenary meetings, the session was
preceded by rumors of a shake-up in the leadership. And this time,
there was expected to be open division over whether to annul the
party's legal monopoly on power.
   The latest rumors were bolstered by the increasing difficulty
Soviet Communists have had preventing their once-monolithic party
from breaking into factions.
   In Leningrad, about 40,000 rank-and-file Communists rallied last
week to support Gorbachev in the face of what they said was a bid
by party conservatives to oust him and his allies, including
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Alexander N. Yakovlev.

<HEAD>State Cites Pizza Shop Owner in Delivery Boy's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of a Domino's pizza franchise has
been charged with violating two state labor regulations and could
be fined $1,000 in connection with a delivery boy's death, state
officials say.
   It is the first time the store owner has been cited in the June
3 death of Jesse K. Colson, 17, of suburban Plainfield. Colson was
making a pizza delivery on a rain-slicked road in Morgan County
when his company-owned truck struck a utility pole.
   His mother, Suzanne Boutros, has criticized Domino's policy of
guaranteeing a pizza delivery within 30 minutes or less, a policy
she believes contributed to her son's death.
   Cross Country Pizza Inc. of Brownsburg, which owns three
Domino's outlets including the one in Mooresville where Jesse
worked, violated two rules of the Indiana Department of Labor,
officials said Friday. Mooresville is 10 miles southwest of
Indianapolis.
   Cross Country owner Steve Osmun did not immediately return a
telephone call placed to his office Saturday seeking comment.
   After Jesse's death, Domino's Pizza Inc. maintained that the
company met a 30-minute delivery guarantee by speedy preparation of
the food at its stores, and did not encourage its drivers to speed.
   In their citations, officials maintained Cross Country ``did not
furnish a place of employment which was free from recognized
hazards that were causing or likely to cause death.'' The second
citation accused the company of failing to promptly report the
boy's death to the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
   Cross Country has until mid-December to file an appeal.
   On Friday, Boutros questioned whether a $1,000 fine was
sufficient penalty.
   ``I'm glad to see some action has been taken, but I think that's
a small fine to pay,'' she said.

<HEAD>HUD Alters Rule, Will Allow Jesus Picture at Homeless Shelter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has revoked its ban on religious decorations in
federally funded shelters and will allow a Salvation Army homeless
shelter to display a picture of Jesus.
   The Salvation Army chapter in New Britain refused for months to
take down the picture, despite a HUD policy against such displays.
But a HUD official said Friday that the agency has amended its
policy.
   ``Essentially, it means that if there is no other indication of
religious influence, religious decorations will be permitted,''
said Robert Kenison, an associate general counsel for HUD in
Washington.
   Kenison said the New Britain controversy was partly responsible
for the change.
   In May, HUD told Salvation Army officials they could not keep a
$9,635 grant for the shelter because of the picture. The money was
not returned, but the Salvation Army did not apply for another
grant.
   Under the new policy, which is still subject to congressional
review, the picture will not diminish the shelter's chance of
getting federal money in the future. But other regulations,
including one that forbids promoting religious beliefs, still will
apply, Kenison said.
   Salvation Army officials welcomed the change, saying it will
allow shelters with religious affiliations to preserve their
principles.
   ``To ask them to compromise their religious beliefs because
there is some part of government funds in the program seems a
little harsh,'' said Margaret Doughty, social services secretary
for the Salvation Army's eastern chapters.

   Two stone-throwing
Palestinians were shot and killed in a clash with soldiers in this
hilltop village Saturday as the Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation entered its third year.
   One Palestinian also was shot and seriously wounded during the
confrontation, and three others suffered gunshot wounds when troops
opened fire on other demonstrators, the army said.
   A general strike was declared throughout the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip by PLO-backed uprising leaders to mark the day, but
there were few protests because of widespread curfews confining
thousands of people to their homes.
   Palestinians carried off symbolic acts of defiance. Outlawed
Palestinian flags were sent aloft with balloons, and newly painted
graffiti praised the uprising, widely known by the Arabic word
``intefadeh.''
   Israelis, Arabs and peace activists also staged several sympathy
protests.
   In Jerusalem, about 4,000 Israelis joined a candelight march
staged by the left-wing group Peace Now. They followed a banner
that read ``143 children, Jewish and Palestinian, have died in the
intefadeh,'' and many carried pictures of the child victims.
   Another banner said: ``Talk to the PLO now.''
   In Beni Naim, a Moslem community of about 13,000 people near
Hebron, soldiers opened fire as they came under a hail of stones
from masked youths and village women.
   The shooting came as hundreds of villagers marched through the
streets with Palestinian flags and banners. ``We salute and praise
our martyrs in the third year of the intefadeh,'' one placard read.
   The trouble began with masked youths throwing rocks at troops at
the village's edge. The troops fired tear gas, and dozens of women
began to scream and throw stones.
   The soldiers opened fire with bullets when they were stoned from
all directions, army officials said. They said two people were
killed and one wounded.
   The dead villagers were identified as Sara Abdul-Fattah
Al-Manasra, a 22-year-old woman shot in the chest, and Kamel
Hussein Humeidat, 28.
   As army helicopters hovered overhead, villagers with olive
branches carried Ms. Al-Manasra's body to the village cemetery.
   Men took turns carrying Humeidat's body to the graveyard, each
wanting to touch him in a last show of respect.
   Eight journalists, including Associated Press reporter Haitham
Hamad, were detained by the army for more than five hours after
they witnessed the soldiers firing at demonstrators in Beni Naim.
The journalists, in several cars, were stopped as they left the
village. Their film and videotapes were seized.
   Others detained were reporters or cameramen for the American
Broadcasting Co., the television agencies Visnews and WTN, and two
free-lance photographers. They were taken to the Hebron police
headquarters.
   Army spokesmen said the eight were not arrested or charged and
their release was delayed because the film and tapes were taken to
be viewed by military officials.
   Hamad said the journalists were asked if they knew they had
entered a closed military area, barred to outsiders. He said he and
the others each had to sign a bail warrant for $1,500 before their
release. The journalists were treated well and given coffee and
cakes, Hamad said.
   Meanwhile, a Palestinian who was shot Thursday while assaulting
a soldier died of his wounds in Tel Hashomer Hospital near Tel
Aviv. He was identified as Atef Mohammed Kulab, 27, of the Gaza's
Khan Yunis refugee camp.
   Saturday's deaths raised to 629 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians since the uprising started
in the Gaza Strip's Jebaliya refugee camp on Dec. 8, 1987.
   An additional 155 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaboration with Israel. Forty-three
Israelis have died in the violence.
   The army moved additional troops into the territories, home to
1.7 million Palestinians, to head off trouble on the anniversary.
At least 2,200 additional police and paramilitary border police
were on duty in Arab east Jerusalem, police said.
   Curfews were maintained for a third day on the Gaza Strip, home
to 750,000 people, and for an ninth day on the West Bank's largest
city, Nablus, with a population of 120,000.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser
Arafat criticized U.S. Middle East peace proposals and vowed to
keep up resistance to Israeli occupation.
   ``The intefadeh is the vehicle for peace ... and no body will
force us to stop it,'' he said. ``We will not kneel despite the
political, diplomatic, financial and media pressures.''

<TEXT>
   The son of the late Russian author
Boris Pasternak received his father's Nobel literature prize
Saturday, 31 years after it was awarded.
   Soviet officials forced the writer to refuse the prize when it
was awarded to him in 1958 for his celebrated novel, ``Doctor
Zhivago.'' He died in 1960.
   A few days ago, Soviet authorities granted his 66-year-old son,
Yevgeny Pasternak, permission to travel to Stockholm to collect the
prize.
   ``Never, ever did I think this could happen ... but the
perestroika is so fast sometimes,'' Pasternak's son was quoted as
saying by the national news agency TT. Perestroika is Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's program of political and social
reform.
   The prize ceremony was held in the Nobel Hall in Stockholm's
Bourse House.
   Pasternak completed Doctor Zhivago in 1955, but the epic of
upheaval in 20th century Russia was banned in his homeland. It was
first published in Italy in 1957 and only last year in the Soviet
Union.
   ``This is a worthy ending of a tragedy ... and I am very
happy,'' the writer's son told the audience when he received the
Nobel medal.
   In the Soviet Union, Pasternak devotes himself to a museum built
in Peredelkino, outside Moscow, to honor his father's memory.

   President Alfredo Cristiani on
Saturday proposed renewing truce talks with leftist guerrillas on
Dec. 20 if they stop attacking civilian targets.
   Cristiani's proposal, made on the eve of a summit of the five
Central American presidents, appeared to be a concession to get the
rebels back to the bargaining table.
   He also offered a $250,000 reward for information leading to the
conviction of the killers of six Jesuit priests and two others who
were slain Nov. 16.
   Cristiani told a news conference his rightist government ``is

Marti National Liberation Front publicly pledges by Dec. 15 to end
all terrorist actions that directly or indirectly affect the
civilian population.''
   Since Cristiani began his five-year term as president on June 1,
two rounds of truce talks in Mexico and Costa Rica have ended in
deadlock because of government insistence that the rebels disarm
immediately and join El Salvador's political life.
   Cristiani said Saturday that he did not expect the rebels to
surrender their weapons while talks are under way. ``If they want
to remain on San Salvador Volcano, that's all right, but they
should not attack the civilian population,'' he said.
   He said a meeting between his U.S.-backed government and rebel
representatives could be held in Caracas, Venezuela, to arrange a
cease-fire and negotiate peace by Feb. 15. The rebels then would be
expected to join the political process, Cristiani said.
   ``When we speak of dialogue, obviously there are issues that
have to be negotiated and discussed, but the FMLN has positions
that are absurd and others that can be discussed,'' he said,
referring to the rebel organization by its Spanish initials.
   If the rebels reject his proposal, the armed forces ``will
continue to confront them militarily,'' he said.
   The rebels have accused the government of not negotiating in
good faith.
   They attacked the Defense Ministry compound in San Salvador with
mortars in October, then canceled a third round of talks planned
for Nov. 20-21 in Caracas when a leftist union hall and the offices
of a human rights group were bombed, apparently in retaliation.
   On Nov. 11, the rebels launched the fiercest offensive in their
decade-old war. The offensive continued sporadically last week,
mostly in the capital.
   Attacks Friday cut power supplies in San Salvador and left the
city hall in flames in El Transito, 75 miles southeast of the
capital.
   An estimated 2,000 people have been killed in the latest round
of fighting. More than 72,000 people, mostly civilians, have died
since the war began.
   ``Since Nov. 11 up to now, they (the rebels) have not attacked
any military objective,'' only civilian targets, Cristiani said.
   He guaranteed a $250,000 cash reward, safety and immunity for
anyone providing information or evidence leading to the conviction
of those responsible for killing the priests, their cook and her
teen-age daughter.
   Fellow Jesuits have said government soldiers entered the
university campus where the priests lived, roused them from bed,
shot them to death and mutilated the bodies.
   A maid at a nearby house, now in Florida for her own safety,
claimed she saw the soldiers enter the Jesuits' house and heard the
shots.
   ``Any person or persons who, against their will or unwittingly,
took part indirectly in this who provides relevant information that
can clarify this crime, will be awarded (the money),'' Cristiani
said.
   He said his government has asked for help from the FBI, Scotland
Yard and police organizations in Spain and Canada.

   Thousands of protesters, many chanting
``Down with the Communists!'' and ``Death to traitors!'' rallied
Saturday to demand a multiparty system and the resignation of the
government.
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said in dispatch from Sofia that
an estimated 5,000 people gathered in the capital's central park in
a prelude to a major pro-democracy rally planned for Sunday.
   The angry demonstration drew a warning from the Communist
government, which has been moving to join the reforms sweeping
Eastern Europe.
   Government spokesman Philip Bokov, in a national broadcast on
state television, said the escalation of tensions and actions of
``extremist elements'' could ``put the country decades back.''
   The demonstrators, some carrying flags of the European Economic
Community to express their hope of European unity, marched to the
National Assembly.
   Most of the people then left, but about 300 continued chanting
slogans calling the four decades of Communist rule an era of
``fascist Communism.'' Tanjug said there was no violence.
   Ten opposition groups recently formed under the new climate of
tolerance have organized the rally for Sunday. The leaders are
expected to outline a program in preparation for the legalization
of all political organizations.
   On Friday, the Communist Party leadership purged four Politburo
members and 22 Central Committee members closely associated with
deposed leader Todor Zhivkov, who was toppled from power last month.
   The dismissals left only three people on the 10-member Politburo
who had served under Zhikvov, an opponent of major reform.
   The 10 opposition groups, which joined Thursday in a
``Federation of Democratic Forces,'' are demanding a multiparty
system, a market economy, independent unions, a democratic
constitution, the rehabilitation of victims of political trials and
a free press.

   Lester and Nancy Haley were the best of
neighbors, always willing to join a party, do a favor or check on a
friend. But their concern for a neighbor led to their deaths after
they stumbled upon her killers, police say.
   When Haley noticed Ida Dougherty's newspaper lying in her
driveway last Monday, he and another neighbor, Verna Horne, wanted
to make sure the 72-year-old woman was all right. They let
themselves in with a key and encountered a teen-age couple who had
stayed in the house after burglarizing it, police say. Mrs.
Dougherty was already dead.
   A short time later, Mrs. Haley grew worried about her husband's
absence and went to the Dougherty home, where she, too, encountered
a gunman. Hours later, the 69-year-old Mrs. Haley and her
87-year-old husband, a retired architect, would be shot to death
and Mrs. Horne, 68, would barely escape with her life.
   Tyrone Baker, 19, was charged Thursday with murder in the deaths
of the Haleys and Mrs. Dougherty. His girlfriend, Lisa Ann
Pfannenstiel, 18, was charged with murder in Mrs. Dougherty's
death. Both of them face a variety of kidnapping, burglary and
robbery charges. They have not entered pleas.
   ``We've had three individuals who were the epitome of
respectability all their lives,'' said police spokesman Lt. Bud
Brooks. ``All were professional people with good educations. And
they were tragically murdered by high school dropouts who were
going down the wrong track of life.''
   The suspects did not know the victims; the crimes were random
acts of violence, said Brooks.
   ``They picked out Mrs. Dougherty's house by happenstance,'' he
said. ``It was a burglary. They had tried several other houses, and
this one apparently was easier to get into.''
   The neighborhood where the victims lived falls short of wealthy
but surpasses comfortable. Older homes wear holiday trim of red
ribbon and green wreaths and reflect their owners' pride through
fresh paint and tidy yards.
   Colby Hamilton, who lived across the street from the Haleys,
called them ``good friends and good neighbors. They'd always do
what they could to help you out in any way.''
   Court and police records outline a chain of events dictated by
chance. Investigators said they determined what happened through
interviews with Mrs. Horne and Ms. Pfannenstiel, who is cooperating
with police.
   After breaking into Mrs. Dougherty's house late Sunday night,
investigators said, the suspects robbed the retired real estate
agent of $70, suffocated her and stuffed her body in the trunk of a
car before dumping it in a rural area of neighboring Douglas County.
   The two returned to her house and opened her wrapped Christmas
packages, looking for things to steal. They spent the night in the
house, and were surprised when the neighbors let themselves in to
check on Mrs. Dougherty the next day.
   Ms. Pfannenstiel said Baker alone drove the Haleys and Mrs.
Horne to the same area where Mrs. Dougherty's body had been dumped.
During the drive, the three neighbors offered to give Baker $1,000
each to let them go, an offer he appeared to consider.
   But Baker ordered them to lie on an embankment while he went to
make sure Mrs. Dougherty was dead, police said.
   The three ran into the woods, and Mrs. Horne volunteered to go
for help while the other two hid. She found her way to safety,
unhurt. But on Tuesday, the Haleys' bodies were found. Each had
been shot at least twice. And Mrs. Dougherty's body was found
Wednesday, covered with leaves.
   The two suspects were in custody Saturday; bail for Baker was
set at $500,000 and Ms. Pfannenstiel's at $200,000. Police said
neither has a criminal record although Baker's driver's license had
been suspended since February and Ms. Pfannenstiel had a history of
running away from home.
   The Haleys, both widowed, were married in 1975. Retirement for
them meant visiting neighbors, socializing with friends and, for
Haley, playing golf.
   ``They were the model of family life,'' the Rev. Charles Erb
said at the memorial service Friday at First Congregational Church.
``There was much more to them than their last few hours of life.''
   The couple first met at the church, while it was being remodeled
and members sat on folding chairs instead of pews.
   ``By the grace of God, they sat next to each other,'' Erb told
the crowd of about 400 mourners. And on that fateful day when the
congregation joined hands as a sign of peace, ``they held hands and
they fell in love.''

<TEXT>
   Anti-communist rebels on Saturday
claimed they shot down five Afghan government aircraft and killed
or captured at least 40 soldiers during a week of fighting in
northern Afghanistan.
   MIDIA, a rebel-supported news organization, said insurgents
downed three helicopter gunships last week as they were strafing
rebel positions around Maimana, the capital of Afghanistan's
northwestern Faryab province. It said all of the people aboard the
helicopters died but gave no death toll.
   Pakistan-based MIDIA said about 40 government soldiers were
killed or captured.
   Abdul Rahim, MIDIA director, also said two fighter-bombers were
shot down by rebel forces outside Baghlan city on the 200-mile
Salang Highway that is the supply line between Kabul, the Afghan
capital, and the Soviet Union.
   Rahim said the two Soviet-supplied planes were downed by rebels
who captured Hasantal, a town near Baghlan, 115 miles north of
Kabul.
   He said the fighting in northern Afghanistan belies President
Najib's claims that rebel field commanders have made political
deals with the Marxist government.
   ``Najib is claiming that fighting is just going on in the south
and along the border, around Jalalabad, because of interference
from Pakistan'' said Rahim. ``But the fighting in the north proves
that it's not true and that the mujahedeen (rebels) have not
reached any agreement with the government.''
   The rebels, in 11 years of fighting successive Marxist
governments, have been unable to capture a major city but control
much of the countryside.
   There were predictions the Kabul government would collapse after
the Soviet Union withdrew the last of its troops in February.
   The Soviets sent troops into Afghanistan in 1979 to help the
government.

<HEAD>Maryland Woman Donates Kidney to Husband</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When Kenneth Warner left the hospital
last week, he wore a red sweatshirt that proudly said, ``My wife
gave me her heart and all her love. Now she gave me a kidney.''
   Warner and his wife of 22 years, Roseanne ``Timmie'' Warner
underwent a rare spouse-to-spouse transplant.
   Roseanne Warner, 46, gave one of her kidneys to her 47-year-old
husband after becoming impatient with a shortage of available
cadaver organs for transplant. The Nov. 29 operation was made
possible by a rare match in the tissues of an unrelated living
donor and recipient, doctors said.
   The couple is recovering well at their home in this Washington
suburb, physicians said. Two of their children, Kathleen, 12, and
Ken Jr., 15, are documenting their progress on home videos.
   ``Our big concern was that the kidney would function properly,''
Kenneth Warner said.
   With anti-rejection drugs increasing the chance of survival for
people receiving kidneys from donors who are not blood relatives,
many doctors view spousal transplants as a way to shorten the wait
for transplants.
   As of Monday, there were 280 people in the Washington area on
the waiting list for kidney transplants, according to the
Washington Regional Transplant Consortium.
   Most transplant organs come from cadavers. But fewer are
available because of better care for people who a few years ago
would have died from their injuries, said Jimmy Light, chairman of
transplantation at the Washington Hospital Center, where the
Warners had their surgery.
   Of those who do die and are medically suitable for organ
harvesting, only about 50 percent of their families give consent,
compared with 83 percent two years ago.
   Kenneth Warner had those statistics to consider after both his
kidneys failed in May. Warner, a maintenance supervisor for the
National Security Agency, was given kidney dialysis treatments
three times a week, but didn't want to stay on dialysis for the
rest of his life.
   He decided he wanted a transplant kidney, and set Christmas as
his personal deadline.
   The couple's oldest daughter, Kelly Ann, a 19-year-old college
student, volunteered her kidney. But Roseanne Warner recalled
discussing a spousal organ transplant with a doctor.
   The Warners ``woke up on a Saturday morning and I said `Why
can't I give you a kidney?''' the secretary said.
   In a series of sophisticated tissue-typing tests to determine
the kind of match Roseanne Warner's kidney would make with her
husband's body, doctors determined that of the six tissue types,
the couple matched on three.
   The chances of that happening between husband and wife are about
one in 2,000, Light said.

   Waving banners and chanting ``inocente,''
supporters of William Lozano rallied to his defense Saturday and
raised funds to appeal the suspended Miami policeman's manslaughter
conviction.
   Lozano, speaking mostly in Spanish to a crowd of more than 300
in Miami's Little Havana section, said he and fellow officers
appreciate the outcry from the Hispanic community after a jury
Thursday convicted him in the deaths of two black men.
   The incident provoked three days of inner-city rioting last
January that left one man dead and more than $1 million in damage.
   ``We want a system of justice, not one of politics,'' the
Colombian-born Lozano said. His supporters have claimed that the
Dade County Circuit Court jury's decision was influenced by fear of
another riot.
   Accompanied by his children and wife, who is also a Miami police
officer, Lozano said the verdict would have a chilling effect on
law enforcement.
   ``Police now wonder if they shoot someone in the line of duty,
will they be the next ones to go to jail,'' he told the rally at
WOCN-AM radio, which has joined other Spanish-language stations in
raising money for an appeal.
   Later, Lozano appeared with several hundred supporters at a
rally in front of the Miami Police Department's headquarters.
   Lozano, 31, is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 24 on two counts
of manslaughter for the deaths of motorcyclist Clement Lloyd and
his passenger, Allan Blanchard, in Miami's Overtown section. He
faces up to 45 years. His attorneys say they will appeal.
   During the seven-week trial, broadcast live on local television
and radio, defense attorneys claimed Lozano shot in self-defense.
Prosecutors alleged he could have avoided the motorcycle.
   In Miami's black neighborhoods, the verdict was celebrated as a
hallmark of justice.
   But along the main street of Little Havana, signs in English and
Spanish read, ``Lozano is 100 percent innocent'' and ``Where would
you be without police?''
   ``People are calling this justice, but that is impossible to
believe,'' said Lozano's mother, Zoila Lozano. ``Look at the people
out here to say that a police officer may go to jail for doing his
job.''
   ``Lozano is seen as a scapegoat in a system that is too worried
about more violence from blacks,'' said George Gonzalez, who joined
the rally outside the station. ``There is a mentality among the
Latins that a cop can do no wrong if he is out fighting bad guys.''
   Nearby, motorists honked horns in support and dropped cash and
checks into wastebaskets and hats bearing pro-Lozano bumper
stickers.
   ``This is people's way of saying that justice has not been
served,'' said Lozano's sister-in-law, Berta.
   Inside the station, a sign was posted with an address for a
Lozano defense fund. A petition also was circulated calling for
Dade Circuit Judge Joseph Farina to allow Lozano to remain free on
bond until his appeal.
   There were no immediate estimates of how much money was raised
Saturday.
   ``Cops are asking themselves now, `What is right?''' said Manuel
Perez, president of the Florida Hispanic Police Officers
Association. ``This is not they way it should be.''
   Police Chief Perry Anderson said earlier that the city's legal
department is reviewing Lozano's termination order, which could be
issued this week. State law requires dismissal of any officer
convicted of a felony.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of a crippling weeklong
strike of public workers declared victory Saturday after agreeing
to end their walkout in exchange for a government pledge to seek
loans to pay back wages.
   After meeting for an hour late Friday with union leaders, Prime
Minister Herbert Blaize promised to convene Parliament on Thursday
to seek its permission to request bank loans to pay workers $9.3
million in promised wages.
   Public Workers Union President Lauret Clarkson said Saturday
that civil servants gained a ``great overwhelming victory'' in the
dispute with Blaize.
   The strike idled about 7,000 public workers _ virtually all the
Caribbean island's teachers and post office, port, customs, and
other public employees.
   It began Dec. 1 after Blaize said he could not make the
payments. The money represents unpaid wage increases from 1987 to
1989.
   Blaize said the funds were unavailable. Since 1987, the
government has borrowed heavily from local banks to curb a growing
budget deficit.
   The strike paralyzed virtually all government agencies,
including key revenue earners such as customs, the treasury and the
post office.
   It was widely believed Blaize had avoided reconvening Parliament
for fear he would face a no-confidence vote, forcing him to resign.
A split within the governing National Party in August left him with
a minority.
   According to Clarkson, Blaize said several officials would leave
the island Sunday to raise the money in Miami and London.

<HEAD>Dukakis Signs Boston Assault Weapons Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis signed legislation
Saturday banning assault weapons in Boston, saying he'd like to see
greater gun control across Massachusetts and the nation.
   ``Semiautomatic assault-style weapons are designed for one
purpose and one purpose only,'' Dukakis said. ``They are designed
to kill other human beings as fast as possible.''
   The ban prohibits the sale of six military-style weapons, and
requires anyone who already legally owns one to register it with
the police commissioner. It also bans certain shotguns and rifles.
   ``This is a message to drug dealers and gangs bent on violence
that we simply will not tolerate these weapons or the violence or
destruction that they bring,'' the governor said at the signing
ceremony at an inner-city police station.
   Police Commissioner Francis Roache said the ban is not a panacea
for Boston's drug or gang problems, but is an important step in the
community's response to violence.
   ``It's going to be a long and painful process until we fully
come to the realization that we're the most violent society in the
world and we have an attitude problem,'' Roache said. ``So we begin
like this, one city changing laws and changing attitudes.''
   The new law gives the commissioner power to place any firearm on
the list of proscribed weapons for 30 days while a board, provided
for in the legislation, decides whether to permanently add the gun
to the list.
   The measure began as a home-rule petition from the City Council
in the spring. The Legislature approved it late last month after a
lengthy debate.
   Michael Yacino, president of the Gun Owners Action League,
described it as the toughest firearms regulation in the state, but
maintains it will do nothing to stop the gang-related violence it
targets.
   Gang- and drug-related slayings are rarely committed by licensed
gun owners, Yacino argued, and more homicides are committed with
handguns than assault weapons.
   Mayor Raymond L. Flynn said tapping the community's outrage over
violence turned the tide in the Legislature.
   ``We probably had more community meetings and discussions about
lobbying state legislators for this legislation than any other,''
Flynn said. Lawmakers' offices were flooded with phone calls in
support of the bill.
   ``It's not enough to do it just for Boston, it's time we did it
for all of Massachusetts and all of America,'' Dukakis said.
``These are weapons that belong on the battlefield, not in crack
houses or in the neighborhoods.''
   The law bans the sale or illegal posession of the AK-47
semiautomatic rifle; the Uzi semiautomatic rifle; the FN-FL
semiautomatic rifle; the FN-FNC semiautomatic rifle; the Steyr Aug
semi-automatic rifle; and the SKS semiautomatic rifle.
   It also bans all shotguns with revolving cylinders and
semiautomatic rifles with fixed magazine capacities of more than 10
rounds, as well as modifications of any proscribed weapons.
   The first offense under the ban carries a $1,000 fine.
Subsequent offenses carry penalties up to 2{ years in jail.
   The Bush administration imposed an import ban on assault-type
rifles in July, but the ban didn't affect guns already owned by
Americans or similar weapons produced by U.S. companies.
   California in May became the first state to enact restrictions
on the possession or sale of such guns. The law was prompted by the
shooting of 35 people at a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard by a gunman
with an AK-47.
   Cities and counties in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey,
New York, Ohio, Colorado and Texas also have enacted ordinances
with certain restictions.

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a newspaper published a purported
inventory of the governor's mansion _ including 156 chairs, six
television sets and 26 sofas _ a miffed Gov. Rudy Perpich and his
wife, Lola, responded by proposing that the state sell off the
place. Besides, his office says, there are a mere 113 chairs and 15
sofas.
   In a huff at what she called criticism of her family's
lifestyle, Mrs. Perpich said Thursday that she and the governor
will ask the 1990 Legislature to sell the mansion and its contents
and donate the proceeds to help the homeless.
   Ray Bohn, Perpich's spokesman, said Friday the attorney
general's office was asked to determine if a sale of the 1910
mansion is possible. Perpich said Saturday he was still awaiting
that ruling.
   Key lawmakers say they would oppose such a sale. Even if they
were agreeable, the deed under which the mansion was donated to the
state in 1965 stipulates the mansion be demolished if not in public
use.
   Lynn Anderson, Perpich's chief of staff, says the Perpiches are
aware that the mansion could face destruction if the property is
sold.
   The dispute grew out of a story in Tuesday's St. Paul Pioneer
Press Dispatch that included an inventory of items in the mansion
and criticism from Senate Minority Leader Duane Benson about the
Perpiches ``lavish lifestyle.''
   Then, on Thursday, Mrs. Perpich accused the newspaper and Senate
Republicans of waging a campaign to ``vilify'' her family and said
she would ask the Minnesota Historical Society and the Minneapolis
Institute of Art to immediately remove all artwork and furniture on
loan to the mansion.
   On Friday, Perpich fueled his longstanding feud with the paper
over coverage of his family by releasing an inventory of
furnishings in the mansion.
   ``These figures differ dramatically from those published in your
newspaper report,'' Perpich said in a letter to the editor. Mrs.
Perpich also said the newspaper had ``greatly inflated'' the amount
of furniture in the residence.
   The article and an illustration indicated the mansion contained
156 chairs, 28 cabinets, 23 lamps, 83 artifacts, six television
sets, 26 sofas, 81 tables, 16 rugs and seven mirrors. The article,
quoting the Governor's Residence Council, put the furnishings'
value at $300,000.
   The inventory released Friday lists 113 chairs, six cabinets, 23
lamps, six television sets, 15 sofas, 59 tables, 12 rugs and six
mirrors. In storage are 42 chairs, 11 sofas, 22 tables, four rugs
and one mirror, many of them put aside because they are too worn
out to use, Perpich said in the letter. The list did not give an
estimate of worth.
   The renovation of the 20-room English Tudor mansion became a
serious project after Perpich's 1982 election. Although Mrs.
Perpich originally said she would prefer living in a townhouse, not
the mansion, she reconsidered under public pressure and began a
campaign to raise private funds for renovation.
   Some $1.3 million has been raised for the mansion in the past 10
years, most of it since Perpich took office.
   Sam Grabarski, chairman of the Governor's Residence Council,
said Friday that request to have artwork loaned to the mansion
taken out would have to be made by the 15-member council, of which
Mrs. Perpich is a voting member, but not the only voting member.
   ``The loan agreement is an agreement that is held between the
museums and the Governor's Residence Council itself, not the
governor's residence,'' he said.
   The first time the Perpiches moved into the mansion was in late
1976 after Perpich, then lieutenant governor, took over when
then-Gov. Wendell Anderson resigned to fill Walter Mondale's

   John Chambers was afraid Lynell Zelenka might
skip town before paying him the $12,000 in back rent he claims she
owes. So he got a court order to seize her property _ including her
pets, Iris the dog and Whitehill the cat.
   Especially her pets.
   ``They are just like my children and this is just like someone
kidnapping my children and holding them hostage for ransom,'' said
Zelenka, 31. ``I think I'll do anything they want.''
   Chambers said he knew how much his tenant loved the animals, and
that's why he took advantage of a Louisiana statute that considers
pets chattel.
   ``There's no intention to do anything that's going to hurt the
dog and cat. I take a back seat to no one in liking animals,'' said
Chambers.
   Zelenka, who claims she only owes $6,000 in back rent on her
three-bedroom carriage house apartment, said the debt began piling
up more than a year ago when she hurt her back.
   Chambers let the payments slide while Zelenka awaited the
outcome of a lawsuit stemming from the injury. But Zelenka settled
the lawsuit for less than she had hoped for and didn't tell her
landlord, Chambers said.
   When Chambers heard the lawsuit was over, he said he thought
Zelenka might try to leave town and decided to take her pets.
   Zelenka came home Wednesday to find her car, furniture, books,
hair dryer _ everything she owned but her personal papers and the
stuff in the refrigerator _ gone. The note on her door said the
Orleans Parish Civil Sheriff's Office had taken her possessions and
her pets.
   Zelenka rescued her pets from a veterinarian, but 20 minutes
after she got them home, sheriff's deputies returned and
confiscated them again. That time the dog and cat were taken to a
pound.
   ``I asked if they could arrest me and leave the animals alone,''
she said, but the deputies refused.
   Zelenka, a court-document specialist, said she wants to pay
Chambers what she can, but doesn't have the money. She says she has
a job in Pittsburgh, but can't move until her dog and cat are free.
   Iris, a 7-year-old Saluki ``with a face like the Lone Ranger,''
and Whitehill, an 11-year-old cat, are her best friends and consume
her every thought, she said.
   ``At least I got her attention,'' said Chambers.

<HEAD>Ice and Snow in Southeast, Heavier Snow in Montana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wintry storms brought snow and freezing rain to several
Southeastern states, and scattered snow across the nation's
northern tier Saturday. Much of the Northeast remained in the grip
of a cold spell.
   Sleet and freezing rain damaged trees and power lines in central
Georgia, and an inch of ice covered roads between Gordon and
Irwinton. Parts of northern Georgia were coated with up to 3 inches
of snow by mid-afternoon, and there were reports of deeper snow in
the mountains.
   Snow also was scattered over western North Carolina at midday,
with almost 6 inches covering Mount Mitchell and 4 inches in Boone.
Freezing rain and sleet extended over southeast Virginia and
central North Carolina.
   Two days of snow and ice made roads treacherous in parts of
North Carolina, officials said.
   Rain fell from the rest of North Carolina to South Carolina,
eastern and central Georgia, east-central Alabama and southeast
Florida.
   Advisories for snow or a mixture of snow and freezing rain were
in effect from northern Georgia to southern Virginia, including the
mountains of northeast Tennessee and the foothills and midlands of
South Carolina.
   Heavier snow fell in the Northwest. In the six hours ended at 11
a.m. EST, 5 inches fell in Havre, Mont., and 4 inches in Mullen,
Idaho.
   A winter storm warning was posted for northern Montana and a
snow advisory was posted for western Wyoming.
   Lighter snow fell in Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin,
northern Minnesota and eastern and south-central North Dakota.
   Cold weather continued in much of the Northeast. The
early-morning temperature was 7 degrees in Allentown, Pa., where
the old record for the date of 11 degrees was set in 1958 and tied
in 1968, and in Harrisburg, where the old mark of 10 had stood
since 1917.
   Saturday's low for the Lower 48 states was 16 degrees below zero
at Montpelier, Vt.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 7 degrees at Caribou and
Limestone, Maine, to 77 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.

   Members of the Mount Gretna Polar Bear Club
will have somewhere to go when it's time to go jump in a lake.
   Their New Year's Day tradition was put in jeopardy when the
owners of Conewago Lake said the event couldn't be held there for
the ninth year because of insurance liability concerns.
   So the blue-lip brigade began their search for a new site.
   The turning point came when a television station did a feature
story on the lake-less Polar Bears and happened to interview
Stephan Boyer, an owner of Willow Springs Sportsmen's Club, who
suggested his club.
   In past years, up to 500 weather-defying people have shown up
and 100 have taken the plunge.
   Willow Springs, 12 miles from the former site, is a flooded
quarry known for its scuba diving among sunken vehicles and heavy
equipment.
   But it also has a shallow end, which is necessary for Polar
Bears who don't mind taking an arctic dip as long as they can keep
their footing.
   Organizer Gordon Sheetz said the water at spring-fed Willow
Springs is about 45 degrees in January, about 10 degrees higher
than Conewago Lake. Consequently, bathers are unlikely to confront
a sheet of ice.
   ``Cutting through the ice always makes it more interesting,''
said Sheetz.

   All this town of 2,000 wanted to do was
correct a glaring ommission. The guest book at the 2-year-old
welcome center hadn't been signed by anyone from Delaware.
   So boosters in this southeastern town offered residents of the
nation's second smallest state a free trip for the best 50-word
essay on ``Why I want to visit Davis County, Iowa.''
   Nine members of the Davis County Tourism Corp. spent Saturday
sifting through 182 entries. The winner wasn't going to be
announced until Sunday.
   The winner will receive plane fare from Philadelphia to Des
Moines to nearby Ottumwa, three nights lodging, all meals, use of a
new car, $15 for gasoline, a month's subscription to the Ottumwa
Courier, a painting of the courthouse and free telephone calls home.
   Six Delaware residents have signed the guest book at the
Bloomfield Welcome Center since the contest was announced, but the
tourism organization decided to proceed with its plans anyway.
   Many of the essays were in rhyme and some were accompanied by
photographs of the writer, but all were sincere about wanting to
visit Davis County.
   A few judges had a good laugh over an essay sent by a woman from
Dover.
   ``At the risk of sounding corny _ This year my husband
celebrates mid-life, my daughter graduates from high school (a
diploma in one hand and my checkbook in the other), and my son has
reached puberty _ and you want to know why I would like to visit
Davis County? Please _ take me!!!!'' the woman wrote.
   She added a postscript: ``I haven't seen $15 worth of gas since
my daughter turned 16 _ and to use a phone without reservations _
bliss!''
   Another essay that received high marks was in verse:
   ``Davis County I want to see
   another jewel in this land of the free
   giving this gift of education
   is a great way to spend a three-day vacation
   We share similar goals from region to region
   but we all suffer from tunnel vision
   The optimal cure for this dreaded disease
   is my answering your ad and you choosing me.''

<HEAD>Board Ends Study Of Psychologists Who Speculated on Kitty Dukakis.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state board recommended no disciplinary action
against four psychologists who speculated about why Kitty Dukakis
drank rubbing alcohol.
   The Board of Registration of Psychologists said in a statement
Friday that it ended its investigation after finding that the
counselors provided satisfactory explanations for their comments.
   The board, whose members are appointed by Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis, said the psychologists had not violated ethical principles
by commenting on the governor's wife without being directly
involved in her case.
   In a Nov. 10 story in The Boston Globe, psychologists Barry Dym,
David Kantor, Carolynn Maltas and Esther Shapiro said Mrs. Dukakis
appeared to suffer from a common problem in which one partner in a
marriage breaks down because he or she carries all the emotional
burdens of the relationship.
   Shapiro told the Globe on Friday that in the wake of the
inquiry, she hoped to develop new guidelines on how psychologists
should talk to reporters.
   The board's principles currently state that psychologists have a
duty not to violate anyone's civil rights and to avoid
``misrepresentation through sensationalism'' and ``superficiality.''
   ``One of the things I was concerned about was that there would
be a terrible chilling effect,'' Shapiro said. ``I want us to
figure out how to be accessible as possible as a field, because
public education about emotional matters is as important a service
as psychologists can serve.''
   Part of the problem, Shapiro said, was that a therapist's
comments about common behavior patterns could be mistakenly
interpreted as a clinical diagnosis.
   Mrs. Dukakis, who has a history of depression and substance
abuse, was hospitalized Nov. 6 after drinking a small amount of
rubbing alcohol. She has since been released and has appeared in
public several times.

<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old girl testified that she was
raped by three crew members for LL Cool J while as many as eight
members of the rap singer's band stood by watching.
   The girl, who said she never saw LL Cool J, said the singer's
bodyguard lured her to his hotel room in suburban Bloomington with
promises of meeting the star and then began sexually assaulting her
there.
   She testified in Hennepin County District Court Friday at the
opening of the trial of bodyguard Christopher Tsipouras, 22, of
Union, N.J.
   Tsipouras is charged with two counts of first-degree sexual
assault stemming from the alleged attack Aug. 10 following a
concert by the popular rap band at Metropolitan Sports Center in
Bloomington.
   The girl testified that she and a 16-year-old friend had won
tickets and backstage passes to the Aug. 9 concert from a radio
station. But when it was time to go backstage, the station's
representative was late. Tsipouras then stepped in with an offer to
meet LL Cool J, she testified.
   The two girls were driven by limousine to the hotel, then taken
to Tsipouras' room, she said. The girl testified that another crew
member left the room upon learning that she was 15.
   She said Tsipouras asked her to come into the bathroom to talk.
Once inside, she said, he closed the door and sexually assaulted
her twice.
   The teen-ager, who said she had never had sex before, said she
was too fearful, embarrassed and humiliated to act assertively.
   She also testified that crew members Gary Saunders and David
Parker assaulted her later while six to eight men came into the
bathroom and watched, some of them standing in the shower.
   ``They were all watching,'' she said. ``They were saying, `When
am I going to get mine.' I told them that this was rape.''
   One man in the group left, saying on the way out, ``Gary, you
are going to look real good in a Minnesota prison,'' she said.
   Her friend, who had gone for a walk with another member of the
entourage, eventually returned and alerted police. The three men
were arrested that night.
   Saunders and Parker are expected to be tried in January, each on
a count of first-degree sexual assault.
   In his opening statement, Tsipouras' attorney, James Grochal,
suggested that the girl had been wearing suggestive clothing and
knew she was going to have sex when she went to the hotel.

<TEXT>
   Communists are likely to lose power in
Estonia and Latvia in local elections Sunday, according to polls
taken in the Baltic republics.
   ``The past comes to an end today,'' the grassroots pro-democracy
People's Front proclaimed in Latvia in an pre-election appeal
asking voters to wrest power from the Communists.
   Results will be carefully watched in Moscow, since the two
Soviet republics are the first of 15 to hold elections for
municipal councils under new rules allowing voters a choice of
candidates.
   The vote also coincides with rising debate over the role of
Communists. On Saturday, the national party's chief ideologue,
Vadim A. Medvedev, said the party is willing to surrender its
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power.
   On Thursday, the legislature of the third Baltic republic,
Lithuania, voted to revoke the constitutional clause guaranteeing
Communist supremacy in society and political life.
   In Estonia, more than 9,000 candidates are vying to fill 4,200
seats in city and rural councils throughout the Soviet Union's
least populous republic with 1.6 million inhabitants.
   Polls show the most popular candidates are environmentalists, or
Greens, with ethnic Estonians favoring the People's Front and the
Russians favoring workers' associations with close links to
Communists.
   ``But if both ethnic and non-ethnic Estonians are considered,
our opinion polls indicate 50 percent support for the Greens _ by
far the best support. The Communists would get under 10 percent,''
said Juhan Kivirahk, from Estonia's Department of Public Opinion
and Market Research.
   He predicted that power in the Estonian capital of Tallinn would
shift from Communists to an electoral union of 10 groups, including
environmentalists and the Estonian People's Front.
   Non-Communists are running on platforms ranging from
environmental protection and economic reform to total independence
for this Baltic state, which was absorbed into the Soviet Union
through a 1939 pact with Nazi Germany.
   A subtle issue only quietly discussed is the tension between
ethnic Estonians and immigrants, mainly Russians, comprising about
40 percent of the republic's population.
   ``I cannot openly declare that I am anti-Russian, but every
Estonian knows which candidate is against the Russians,'' Ain
Roopson, an independent candidate, said in an interview.
   In October, Estonia's parliament under Kremlin pressure
abandoned an attempt to impose residency requirements for voters,
but it retained the requirement that a candidate in the election
must have lived in Estonia for at least two years.
   In Latvia, Imans Daudis, a secretary of the top government
executive body, the Presidium, called Sunday's vote ``the first
election conducted in the situation of real political pluralism.''
   Only 34 percent of the candidates in the republic of more than
2.5 million people are members of the Communist Party, while 32
percent are members of the People's Front.
   In March elections for the new Soviet parliament, People's Front
candidates trounced party-backed candidates in races across all
three Baltic states.

<HEAD>47 Seamen Missing in North Atlantic Storm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ships, planes and helicopters
searched across hundreds of miles of the North Atlantic on Saturday
for 47 seamen from two cargo ships and a fishing vessel missing in
a savage storm.
   Only one body has been recovered _ that of a crewman from the
60-foot fishing trawler Johnny and Sisters II of Shelburne, Novia
Scotia, that sank Friday night with eight men aboard.
   Bill McDonald, a search and rescue spokesman in Halifax, said
the Johnny and Sisters II disappeared about 150 miles south of Cape
Race, Newfoundland.
   Maritime officials said a crewman aboard the Japanese fishing
trawler Kinei Maru III died of head injuries suffered when the
135-foot boat was pummeled by howling winds and two-story-high
waves. They said the Kinei Maru, which was about 450 miles south of
Halifax, radioed that another crewman also was injured but the
vessel was too far away to be reached by helicopter.
   The search was scaled down Saturday night for 39 seamen from two
cargo ships that disappeared in raging seas in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence on Thursday night.
   Search vessels and aircraft braved the storm Friday and Saturday
but found no bodies from the 400-foot Capitaine Torres or the
270-foot Johanna B. When radio contact was lost, the two cargo
ships were about 120 miles apart north of Cape Breton.
   Coast guard officials said a lifeboat from the Johanna B was
found floating upside down.
   The Panamanian-registered Johanna B had a crew of 16, all
Filipinos, an agent for the ship reported.
   The Captaine Torres, with 23 men aboard, was owned by a New
Caledonia company and officials said the crew included French,
Fijian, Dutch, Filipino and Vanuatu seamen.
   Maritime officials said the storm, with winds gusting up to 96
mph, also stranded two ferries bound for Newfoundland from North
Sydney, Nova Scotia.
   They said the Sir Robert Bond, with 51 passengers, has been
anchored since Thursday evening off Cape Smoky, Nova Scotia, about
30 miles from North Sydney, and winds were too strong for the ferry
to return to North Sydney.
   The officials said the ferry Caribou was anchored in North
Sydney and had been there since Friday. They said they did now know
how many people were aboard.
   A fishing trawler with a crew of 33 Koreans sank off
Newfoundland in November 1987, drowning all aboard.
   In one of the worst accidents off Newfoundland, 84 people
perished when the Ocean Ranger oil rig tipped over and sank in
February 1982.

   Soldiers loyal to European
mercenaries who seized power in this island nation used tear gas
Saturday to block a rally by hundreds of protesters angry about the
coup.
   In Paris, the Defense Ministry said it was preparing to evacuate
French citizens from the Indian Ocean islands if necessary, but it
denied planning a military intervention of the former French colony.
   Foreign diplomats have accused the mercenaries' leader,
Frenchman Bob Denard, of ordering or carrying out the Nov. 26
assassination of President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmane.
   There has been previous spontaneous protests against Denard, but
Saturday's demonstration would have been the first planned in
advance.
   However, soldiers from the Presidential Guard, which is
commanded by the mercenaries, dispersed the crowd at Moroni's
central mosque before the protest could begin. There were no
reports of arrests or injuries.
   France and South Africa, the biggest donors to the islands off
the African coast near Madagascar, both have cut off aid since the
assassination. They are pressuring Denard to leave.
   Denard, 60, denies any role in Abdallah's death and insists he
will not be forced from the islands.
   The 30 mercenaries, all French or Belgian, on Thursday expelled
11 foreign journalists from the islands, accusing them of inciting
protests. The same day, the Presidential Guard used tear gas and
clubs to disperse an anti-Denard protest by hundreds of youths, and
some protesters were arrested.
   On Friday, the acting president, Said Mohamed Djohar, said in a
radio broadcast that no political meetings should be held.
   In Paris, a French Defense Ministry spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity, denied reports that a commando force had
been dispatched to Mayotte, an island in the Comoro archipelago
that remained French when the other islands became independent in
1975.
   ``There's been no commandos sent to the Comoros,'' the spokesman
said.
   However, he said reinforcements had been sent to the French
island of Reunion, also in the Indian Ocean, in case evacuation of
French citizens becomes necessary, ``without any intention of
intervening in the Comoros.''
   Denard led a 1975 coup that ousted Abdallah. In 1978, with the
blessing of France and South Africa, Denard led another coup,
returning Abdallah to power.

<TEXT>
   Tiny Sarina Jones was recovering well Saturday
after undergoing the nation's second living-donor liver transplant,
but the 15-month-old faces a tougher battle recuperating in the
next few weeks, hospital officials said.
   Sarina remained in critical but stable condition Saturday
evening, the day after doctors at the University of Chicago Medical
Center removed the left lobe of 20-year-old father Robert Jones'
liver and implanted it in the infant. Jones' condition was upgraded
from critical but stable to serious but stable.
   Sarina's response since the 7{-hour operation was completed just
after 10:30 p.m. Friday ``has been literally outstanding,''
hospital spokeswoman Mary Fetsch said Saturday. She said Jones
``also came back out of surgery just remarkably well.''
   Jones, a dry-wall installer from the Memphis, Tenn., area, could
be moved from the intensive care unit by Sunday, Ms. Fetsch said.
   Dr. Christoph Broelsch, the transplant surgeon who performed the
operation, said the surgery was ``very difficult,'' in part because
doctors had to remove signs of a bacterial infection from the
child. They worried it could linger and infect the new organ.
   Ms. Fetch said doctors will closely monitor Sarina during the
next 24 to 48 hours for signs of infection or other complications.
   ``After that, the next hurdle she'll have to overcome is within
the next seven to 10 days when any signs of rejection of the new
liver would begin to show up,'' Ms. Fetsch said.
   If she overcomes those two hurdles, the spokeswoman said, ``the
next step is to get her out of the hospital, and that could be
anywhere from four to eight weeks from now.''
   ``And once we get her to that point we feel that the next hurdle
she has to overcome is the one-year to three-year mark _ where she
doesn't experience any rejection or complications,'' Ms. Fetsch
said. ``And then we feel like she'll be pretty much home free for
the rest of her life.''
   Dr. Peter Whitington, director of pediatric transplant services
at the University of Chicago Medical Center, said doctors also want
to see the youngster gain weight. He said earlier in the week that
Sarina was ``every bit as malnourished as an Ethiopian refugee''
because of her condition and infection.
   Sarina has suffered since birth from a usually fatal disorder
called biliary atresia.
   The congenital disorder also afflicted 21-month-old Alyssa
Smith, who on Nov. 27 received part of her mother's liver at U of C
in the first living-donor liver transplant in the United States.
   Alyssa, of Schertz, Texas, near San Antonio, was in serious but
stable condition Saturday evening, with her liver function
``rapidly improving toward normal'' and no signs of her body
rejecting the transplant, Ms. Fetsch said.
   Her mother, Teresa Smith, a 29-year-old schoolteacher, was
released from the hospital Thursday on the arm of her husband, John
L. Smith. The couple planned to visit their daughter during her
recovery, and were staying at a nearby Ronald McDonald House, a
place for families of children hospitalized away from home.

<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy is
investigating a report that a structural engineer was fired after
concluding that an earthquake could cause the walls to collapse at
the department's Y-12 nuclear weapons plant, a DOE official
confirmed Saturday.
   The engineer, Paul Nestel, says other engineers then rewrote his
study to say the walls of the Oak Ridge plant were sturdy enough.
   The revised report was based on ``spurious calculations that
would be obvious to any engineer with earthquake experience,''
Nestel told The Washington Post. He called the nuclear plant, built
near the end of World War II, an example of ``Third World
construction.''
   Nestel was recruited in July by Lockwood Greene Inc. of Oak
Ridge to conduct the earthquake study for Martin Marietta Energy
Systems Inc., which operates the Oak Ridge plant for the Energy
Department, the Post reported Saturday.
   ``I cannot comment on the study because it is still being
drafted,'' said Steve Wyatt, a spokesman for the DOE facilities.
``I cannot comment on Mr. Nestel because he is not a DOE employee.
   ``What I can comment on is that we are looking into the matter.''
   Wyatt said a two-person internal panel has been appointed to
review the case beginning next week. The review should take about a
week, he said.
   Nestel reported Sept. 25 that the unreinforced clay tile walls
of the main building of the Y-12 plant would give way if struck by
an earthquake with a lateral force of .12 percent of gravity, well
below the .19 percent used nationwide as the ``design basis'' for
quake vulnerability studies.
   San Francisco's Marina district was heavily damaged in the
October earthquake by a force of .15 percent, Nestel told the Post.
Nestel, a Californian, said the New Madrid fault ``altered the
course of the Mississippi River'' when it last slipped early in the
19th century. The earthquake created Reelfoot Lake in western
Tennessee.
   ``If it slipped again, it would certainly destroy those walls,''
he said.
   Although Oak Ridge is in East Tennessee and the fault is several
hundred miles west, the shock of eastern earthquakes is spread over
a wider area.
   By Oct. 30, Nestel told the Post, engineers with Lockwood Greene
and Martin Marietta had met to discuss his findings. He said they
then reported to DOE that the walls ``have the capacity to
withstand the design-basis earthquake.''
   Nestel was fired Nov. 3.
   Wyatt said the DOE review into Nestel's allegations would
include the circumstances of his firing and the report itself.
   ``We're bringing in one individual on the panel who has a
knowledge of seismic studies to take an independent look at the
whole affair,'' Wyatt said. ``We can't make any judgments until
we've reviewed all the facts of the matter.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Communist
leadership Saturday he is ready to modify or abandon the party's
constitutional monopoly on power but only as part of sweeping
political reforms.
   ``In the framework of this process, any article (of the
constitution) can be the subject of modification or be excluded.
This fully refers as well to Article 6,'' Gorbachev told the
party's policy-making Central Committee meeting.
   Article 6 in the 1977 constitution makes the 20-million-member
Communist Party ``the leading light and guiding force'' in Soviet
society.
   The debate over the party's role reflects the reforms in Eastern
Europe, where Hungary has dropped the word ``Communist'' from the
party's name and is preparing for multiparty elections, Poland has
installed a non-Communist prime minister and Czechoslovakia and
East Germany have repealed the Communists' monopoly on power.
   On Thursday, Lithuania became the first of the 15 constituent
Soviet republics to drop a constitutional guarantee of Communist
power and approve a multiparty system.
   The Central Committee meeting was to prepare for the new session
of the Congress of People's Deputies, the national parliament, that
convenes Tuesday.
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and several other
members of parliament have called for a brief general strike Monday
to show support for removing the constitutional clause assuring the
Communist Party of power.
   Vadim A. Medvedev, the party's chief ideologue, said Sakharov's
call for a strike violates the ethical standards of a legislator in
view of parliament's appeal to refrain from strikes that could
deepen the country's economic crisis.
   Gorbachev, in a clear reference to Sakharov, said those
demanding the urgent revocation of Article 6 were trying to
``demoralize Communists, lower their activity at a turning point in
perestroika'' _ his program for restructuring the Soviet economy
and society.
   ``We must not create a new constitution until we have more or
less clearly defined the contours of the renewed social mechanism,
the optimal structure of organs of power and adminstration, the
order of interaction of political forces,'' Gorbachev said,
according to a text provided by the official Tass news agency.
   The 58-year-old leader used the phrase ``political forces''
instead of political parties, but he clearly was referring to a
role for groups not controlled by the Communists.
   Gorbachev called for patience in rewriting the constitution.
   ``Comrades, let's not forget that this is already the fifth
constitution under Soviet power,'' he said. ``This time let's try
to create a law that country can live with for a long time.''
   Tass said Gorbachev opposes a reassessment of the party's
constitutional guarantees until preparations begin for a nationwide
party congress in October 1990.
   ``There is no need to speed up this process now,'' Gorbachev
said of Sakharov's effort to raise the issue in parliament.
   Tass said the 250-member Central Committee agreed with Gorbachev
on what parliament should discuss.
   In other developments at the committee session:
   _ Medvedev, speaking at a news conference at the end of the
Central Committee meeting, said Gorbachev's perestroika program was
criticized during the 10-hour meeting by ``conservative and
dogmatic'' speakers.
   _ He said Gorbachev did not come under personal attack, and he
attributed the argments over reform to ``the exacerbated situation
in the country and the need for fast progress.''
   _ The Central Committee endorsed a program to revive the
faltering state-run economy and to prepare the 13th Five-Year Plan
for 1991-95.
   _ It elevated the new party chief of the Ukraine, Vladimir
Ivashko, to membership on the ruling Politburo. It also named the
recently appointed editor of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda,
Ivan Frolov, to the Secretariat, which handles the day-to-day
running of party business.
   Echoing a policy announced more than a year ago by Gorbachev,
Medvedev said the party's goal is to ``move away from being the
guiding nucleus of the whole government structure to becoming a
political vanguard.''
   For more than seven decades, the party has dictated everything
from the direction of Soviet foreign policy to how much collective
farms should produce and how much state stores charge for a bar of
soap.
   Ivashko, 57, became the 12th member of the Politburo, succeeding
Ukrainian party boss Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, who was retired at
the last Central Committee plenary meeting in September.
   The new party chiefs in Moscow and Leningrad, the country's
largest cities, were not given Politburo seats in contrast to the
usual practice.
   But Medvedev said Leningrad chief Boris Gidaspov and Yuri
Prokofiev of Moscow were named to the new 16-member party bureau
for the Russian federation, which will be headed by Gorbachev and
provide a separate party leadership for the country's largest
republic.
   Medvedev, a Politburo member, indicated the Kremlin would not
try to stop the Lithuanian Communist Party from declaring
independence from Moscow at a congress opening Dec. 18.
   ``There are no problems that our party can fail to cope with,''
Medvedev said.
   Medvedev said the Central Committee will meet again in January
to lay the groundwork for the 28th party congress in October that
is empowered to change the party's policies and guidelines.

   East Germany's Communist Party apologized
Saturday for leading the country into crisis and overwhelmingly
elected as its new chief Gregor Gysi, a 41-year-old reformer known
for defending the rights of the opposition.
   Gysi promised that the Communists are willing to enter into a
government coalition with other parties after free elections
proposed for May.
   He also said the party is abandoning its claim to absolute rule
and held up a huge janitor's broom, symbolizing his determination
to make a clean sweep and start anew.
   Gysi, 41, a bespectacled, blunt-talking intellectual, is the
youngest Communist Party chief in Eastern Europe. He was chosen
during a 17-hour emergency party congress that started Friday night.
   After the election, reformist Premier Hans Modrow set up a
commission to study an overhaul of the nation's increasingly
troubled economy, plagued by slow growth, consumer product
shortages and a foreign debt of $20.6 billion.
   Gysi called the party's problems ``insanely complicated,''
despite promises of new ideas, new personnel and more democratic
ideas.
   The party chairman also cautioned the more than 2,700 delegates
at the party congress that there ``aren't any miracles.''
   Miracles may be what is needed for the Communists, who were
holding what almost certainly will be their last session as the
country's ruling force.
   Party officials disclosed Tuesday that 500,000 members had quit
since September, more than twice the previously published figure.
   That brings the membership to less than 1.8 million, seriously
weakening the force that held an iron-fisted sway over East Germany
for four decades.
   The Communists also have lost their monopoly on power in
Czechoslovakia, where formation of the first government not
dominated by Communists was announced Saturday.
   In the Soviet Union, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the
Communist leadership he is ready to modify or abandon the party's
constitutional monopoly on power but only as part of sweeping
political reforms.
   With seven former Politburo members in jail and some ousted
leaders charged with corruption, the East German Communists
squarely faced up to the abuses of the past.
   The first section of a report approved by the delegates issued
an apology, saying the former leadership ``had led our country into
this crisis threatening its existence.''
   ``We are willing to make amends,'' the report said.
   The delegates decided to change the party's name later this week
but voted against disbanding altogether. They also voted to
streamline the leadership.
   Gysi, one of East Berlin's most prominent lawyers, infuriated
hard-line rulers in October by representing the New Forum
opposition group in its bid to become a legal organization.
   After weeks of trying amid growing tumult, the 200,000-strong
New Forum gained legal recognition needed to avoid official
suppression.
   After his election, Gysi pledged to work for democratic
socialism, a term that has become increasingly popular among the
country's reformers, both within the Communist Party and outside
it. He said the Communists would be ``one party among others.''
   He pledged to continue the break with the abuses of hard-line
Stalinism but also said the country has no intention of adopting
capitalism, and he repeated his opposition to reunification of the
Germanys.
   More than 6,000 people, some of them East Germans, took part in
a demonstration late Saturday in West Berlin to protest growing
calls for reunification.
   Several West German politicians reacted skeptically to the
Communist Party meeting. Volker Ruehe, the general secretary of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, repeated his
assertion that the East German Communist Party has failed despite
the new chairman.
   The Communists have lost much of their control in recent weeks
and have granted historic concessions to the opposition, including
opening the Berlin Wall and other borders, in a desperate effort to
remain in power.
   Long-time party leader Erich Honecker was ousted from power Oct.
18 as tens of thousands of East Germans fled West and thousands
more took to the streets to demand democratic reforms. He is now
under house arrest and charged with corruption and abuse of power.
   Egon Krenz took over from Honecker and introduced reforms, such
as opening the borders, but his long-time association with the
Honecker regime forced his ouster last week.
   The 10-member Politburo and 163-member Central Committee
resigned at the same time, and a 25-member panel of reformers was
named to run party affairs until the weekend congress.
   Gysi, whose father is Jewish, served until last year as the
state secretary for religious affairs, a high-ranking post.
   Party spokeswoman Brigitte Zimmermann, briefing reporters on the
closed session of the emergency congress, said Gysi was the only
candidate to become the party's third leader in less than two
months.
   The official news agency ADN said 95.3 percent of the 2,714
delegates participating voted for Gysi in balloting that took 5{
hours.
   In a secret ballot, delegates also chose other members in a new
100-member party leadership over which Gysi will preside.
   Gysi has backed sweeping political and economic reforms. He was
a member of the interim party leadership and is heading a committee
investigating corruption under the ousted leadership.
   Gysi is an avid supporter of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's glasnost policy of a more open and free society. At a
Nov. 4 rally of about 1 million in East Berlin's Alexander Platz, a
large square in the city center, Gysi said that ``glasnost belongs
in the German vocabulary.''

<HEAD>600 People Return Home After Propane Pipeline Repaired</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 600 people returned to their homes in
this south-central Illinois village Saturday after workers repaired
a ruptured pipeline that spawned a huge propane gas cloud.
   Residents were evacuated and electricity and gas were turned off
Friday to prevent any possibility of igniting the 15-acre cloud of
gas that leaked from the Phillips 66 pipeline, firefighter Tom
Moroney said. Gas and electrical power were turned back on Saturday.
   ``We are returning somewhat to normalcy,'' Moroney said.
   A farmer broke the pipe while cutting through a field with a
plow, Montgomery County sheriff's deputies said.
   ``I was working on a hill that overlooks that area,'' said
farmer Don Faller, 38. ``I saw a huge cloud starting to appear,
very low to the ground, very dense.''
   Officials evacuated a six-mile area around Butler about 5 p.m.
Friday as a precaution.
   Phillips Petroleum Co. employees worked overnight to repair the
line, and most of the gas had dispersed by sunrise, Moroney said.
   The propane pipeline runs from Decatur in central Illinoi to St.
Louis. It runs about a mile northwest of Butler, which is about 50
miles northeast of St. Louis.
   Police and fire officials allowed residents back into their
homes shortly after 7 a.m. Saturday after firefighters and
hazardous materials experts from the state police checked homes for
gas, state police Sgt. Lyndall Heyen said.
   There were no injuries.

   The Air Force said Saturday it will
launch a Delta 2 rocket Sunday with a military navigation
satellite, taking priority over the flight of a commercial Titan 3
booster with two foreign satellites.
   The Titan 3 liftoff was postponed Thursday night by a computer
software problem and Friday night by stormy weather. The launch was
to mark the entry of Martin Marietta into the commercial launch
business.
   Company officials said Saturday that other launches planned at
Cape Canaveral over the next nine days have priority, so the Titan
3 can't be launched until at least Dec. 20.
   However, they said if one of the other rockets is delayed, the
Titan 3 could move up. The rocket is to carry communications
satellites for a Japanese company and Britain's Ministry of Defense.
   The Delta launch from another pad was set for 12:58 p.m. EST
with the launch window extending until 1:19 p.m. The rocket carries
the fourth in a series of Navstar satellites that enable U.S. and
allied military forces to pinpoint their location anywhere on Earth
within 50 feet.
   Other pending launches are those of a Trident 2 military missile
from the submarine USS Tennessee during the coming week and space
shuttle Columbia on Dec. 18.
   Columbia's five astronauts are to deploy a Navy communications
satellite and then track down and retrieve for return to Earth a
science payload that has been orbiting the globe for nearly six
years.

   Premier Marian Calfa and
opposition leaders agreed Saturday to form the first government in
more than four decades not dominated by Communists.
   Calfa made the announcement shortly after President Gustav
Husak, the last hard-line Communist in a position of power,
announced he will resign as soon as the new government is installed.
   The premier said the government will be sworn in Sunday and will
have 10 Communists, including Calfa himself, and 11 non-Communists
_ two members each from the small Socialist and People's parties
and seven ministers with no political affiliation.
   The Socialists and People's parties were formerly docile
Communist allies but have helped the pro-reform movement by playing
an increasingly independent role.
   Speaking on national television, Calfa said the Communists and
opposition representatives decided on the ``government of national
understanding'' after a ``very difficult'' day of bargaining. He
did not say how the portfolios would be distributed.
   Opposition leader Vaclav Havel, speaking after Calfa, declared
the opposition satisfied with the outcome of two days of
``round-table'' negotiations that ended late Saturday.
   ``It was the maximum that could have been achieved at a given
moment under these conditions,'' Havel said. He described the
negotiations as ``very intensive, tiring and complicated.''
   However, the opposition was in buoyant spirits when its
delegation returned to cheers, claps and kisses from workers at its
central Prague headquarters.
   Havel flashed a V-for-victory sign as he dashed into a
closed-door meeting, which opened with greetings from Polish
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   ``This is 99 percent of my wishes come true,'' said composer
Michael Kocab, who was in the opposition delegation that negotiated
with Calfa. ``The other 1 percent would be Havel for president.''
   The peaceful revolution here follows similar reforms in Poland,
Hungary and East Germany.
   In Czechoslovakia, the talks on the government were the second
attempt in a week to create a government acceptable to the
opposition, which has staged a stunningly successful pro-democracy
campaign.
   The Communists agreed Nov. 28 to give up their party's 41-year
monopoly on power. Communist Premier Ladislav Adamec then named a
Cabinet that gave non-Communists only five of the 21 seats and left
Communists controlling all key posts.
   The opposition threatened a nationwide general strike if a new
Cabinet with more non-Communists was not named by Dec. 10. Hundreds
of thousands of people staged rallies in support of the demand.
   Adamec resigned and was replaced by Calfa.
   Jan Carnogursky, a dissident lawyer who heads the opposition
group Public Against Violence, said he hoped new elections could be
held soon. Carnogursky is among the opposition activists named for
inclusion in the new government, possibly as a deputy premier.
   Reform-minded Communist economist Valtr Komarek also has the
backing of the opposition.
   Husak will swear in the ministers as his last official act.
   The 76-year-old president was one of the hard-liners put into
power after Warsaw Pact tanks crushed the 1968 ``Prague Spring''
reform movement. The others, including party chief Milos Jakes,
have been ousted in the last month.
   ``Right after the naming of the new government, I will resign
... to make further development easier,'' said Husak, who has held
the largely ceremonial job since 1975.
   Husak had been the focus of many anti-government demonstrations,
and the opposition had demanded he quit by Sunday.
   His resignation will mark the end of two decades of strict
Communist rule in Czechoslovakia that began after the 1968 invasion
that crushed Alexander Dubcek's reforms.
   Dubcek was dumped as Communist Party leader and replaced by
Husak, who served from 1969 until his replacement by Jakes in 1987.
Husak remained president, and his present five-year term had been
set to expire in May 1990.
   The five Warsaw Pact nations that took part in the 1968 invasion
have since condemned the action. Husak alluded to recent criticism
of the post-1968 crackdown, allowing that there were some ``bad
things.''
   But he stuck fast to his lifelong belief in the socialist system.
   ``Whatever mistakes occurred were the mistakes of people and not
of fundamental ideas,'' he said, welcoming what he called the
``renaissance'' of socialism under way in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union.
   In East Germany, the Communist Party on Saturday chose a
reformer, Gregor Gysi, as its new chief and apologized for mistakes
of the past that led the country into crisis.
   In the Soviet Union, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the
Communist leadership he is ready to modify or abandon the party's
constitutional monopoly on power, but only as part of sweeping
political reforms.
   The Czechoslovak opposition won yet another concession Saturday
with the announcement by Interior Minister Frantisek Pinc that
authority over all police, including counterintelligence and secret
police, will pass from the ministry to more direct government
control.
   Pinc also apologized to students who were beaten by riot police
on Nov. 17. The attacks on peaceful protesters sparked the
pro-democracy movement.
   ``Nothing like this will happen again,'' CTK quoted Pinc as
saying. ``We fully support the creation of a truly democratic
society.''

   California voters of every religion believe a
Roman Catholic bishop was wrong to bar a state Assemblywoman who
supports abortion rights from taking Communion, according to a Los
Angeles Times poll.
   The bishop's action was seen as inappropriate by 71 percent of
registered voters surveyed in the poll, including 71 percent of
Catholics and 70 percent of Protestants, the newspaper reported
Saturday.
   Assemblywoman Lucy Killea was in the midst of a bitterly
contested race in San Diego County for the state Senate last month
when Bishop Leo T. Maher ordered her not to take Communion unless
she recanted her abortion views.
   Killea, a Democrat who had been seen as an underdog in the race
against Republican Assemblywoman Carol Bentley, won a narrow
victory Tuesday. Bentley said the bishop's sanction propelled her
opponent to victory.
   ``Although religion has always played an important part in
American politics, this survey reaffirms that a majority of voters
are likely to resent attempts by the church to influence the
outcome of political contests,'' Times Poll Director I.A. Lewis
said.
   The Times polled 2,046 adults, including 1,594 registered
voters, over a five-day period last week, the newspaper said.
   Among other findings:
   _ A majority of people who are against abortion _ 52 percent _
felt Maher's action was wrong.
   _ A majority of Californians support a woman's right to
abortion. Fifty-four percent of all those polled were in favor of
abortion, 36 percent were opposed and 10 percent were undecided.
   _ Among California's Catholics, those registered to vote favored
abortion by a 5-4 margin, while those not registered opposed it 7-5.
   The newspaper said the survey had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's decision to send two
high-level emissaries to China, in hopes of normalizing relations,
will not mean the lifting of sanctions imposed after Beijing's
crackdown on pro-democracy movements last June, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Saturday.
   Fitzwater said the unannounced trip by National Security Adviser
Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
was an exception to formal policy that bars high-level talks with
Beijing. He said political and economic sanctions Bush invoked
after troops brutally suppressed pro-democracy movements will
remain in place for the time being.
   In Beijing, speaking at a dinner held by Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen, Scowcroft said, ``We come to reduce the negative influence
of irritants in the relationship.''
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y. and chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, criticized the
sudden trip.
   ``I thought it was another example of the administration's
unfortunate tendency to kow-tow to the Chinese,'' Solarz said. ``It
also struck me as a repudiation of the president's own policy of
suspending all high-level contacts with China pending an
improvement in the human rights situation in that country.''
   Last spring, Bush, a former U.S. liaison to China, was
criticized for not reacting strongly and quickly enough to China's
harsh repression of political dissent.
   Fitzwater said the trip was chiefly intended to brief the
Chinese on Bush's summit last week in the Mediterranean with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush felt in addition that ``we should take this opportunity''
to also begin ``exploring ways of resuming relations'' in the
aftermath of China's brutal crackdown last June on pro-democracy
demonstrations, Fitzwater said.
   The trip, which wasn't announced by the White House until the
two men arrived in China at 1 a.m. EST Saturday, is an exception to
formal policy, Fitzwater said. Similar exceptions were made when
Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with the Chinese foreign
minister in Paris and again in New York, he added.
   Asked about the unusual middle-of-the-night announcement, well
after most newspapers' deadlines, Fitzwater denied any intended
secrecy.
   He noted it was not customary to announce such briefing trips
and said the Chinese had asked that it not be disclosed until the
two men had arrived. Fitzwater said he did not know why Beijing
wanted the meeting kept quiet.
   In June, Bush expressed the administration's displeasure with
the violent suppression of the pro-democracy demonstrations by
imposing several economic and political sanctions against China.
   Those sanctions suspended all military and commercial weapons
sales to the Asian nation. Additionally, visits between U.S. and
Chinese military leaders were halted and visa extensions for about
40,000 Chinese students in the United States were given
``sympathetic review'' by the State Department.
   ``We're not forgetting what happened,'' when the tanks rolled
through Tiananmen Square, the site of rallies by hundreds of
thousands of Chinese, Fitzwater said of keeping the sanctions in
place.
   However, he said, ``As a world participant, we have to be in the
position of having some contacts and relations with them over the
long term.
   ``We needed to at least start the process of having contacts and
some normalization of relations with the Chinese.''
   Fitzwater said Scowcroft would ``raise issues of human rights
and political rights'' in his talks with Chinese leaders, but
declined to discuss to what extent Scowcroft would tie those issues
to resumption of normal relations.
   ``We want to start down that road because China is a major world
participant,'' Fitzwater said.
   The presidential spokesman said the American representatives
would be discussing the reforms in Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union, as well as the Malta talks.
   The two officials will return Dec. 11 after stopping in Japan to
also brief that nation's leaders on the summit.
   In the statement released by the White House early Saturday,
Fitzwater said the president still ``deplores'' the tragedy of
Tiananmen Square.
   When the crackdown first began last June, Bush initially
refrained from harshly condemning the Chinese actions, but then he
announced a series of sanctions designed to show U.S. disapproval.
   In recent weeks, administration officials have said little about
China. Bush made no comment when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded
to the Dalai Lama of Tibet, who is a symbol of opposition to

   Chinese students marked the 54th anniversary of a
student uprising Saturday with official functions stressing loyalty
to the Communist Party and the socialist system.
   The official media reported that art festivals, symposiums and
performances were held around the country to commmemorate the
``Dec. 9th'' movement of 1935 when Beijing students took to the
streets to protest Japanese aggression in China.
   As with other anniversaries of historic student movements, the
government moved to preempt any student activism by holding events
in which the emphasis was on obedience rather than resistance.
   Li Ximing, party chief in Beijing and a member of the Politburo,
told a symposium that college students should ``take the social
responsibility to devote themselves to the socialist cause,'' the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   It quoted one student from the Beijing Normal University, a
center of activism during the pro-democracy demonstrations this
year, as saying that students had begun to turn to the works of
Marx, Lenin and Mao Tse-tung because after the political turmoil
they realized their theoretical level was low.
   But it also noted that another student commented that the Dec.
9th Movement anniversary was different this year because ``students
were more calm and thoughtful rather than being full of
experience.''
   Xinhua reported that at Beijing University an audience of 1,000
gave warm applause to 100 students singing, ``The east is red, the
sun is rising, China has brought forth a Mao Tse-tung.''
   The Youth News said that in the central city of Wuhan, the play
``We and the Motherland'' was staged and the teaching of
revolutionary tradition and patriotism was carried out.
   In the Shandong provincial capital of Jinan, the daily said,
students at a symposium pledged to follow the Communist Party and
integrate themselves with workers and peasants.
   Student dissent was effectively silenced by the violent military
takeover of student-held Tiananmen Square on June 3-4, and the vast
majority of students, wishing to avoid repercussions, are carefully
mouthing the party line.
   Privately, however, some students say the harsh political
repression since June has only hardened their resentment toward the
government and their convictions that the intransigence of the
current leadership will only lead to further conflict.

   President Oscar Arias condemned the
superpowers Saturday on the eve of a Central American summit,
saying they talk of peace while supporting military solutions.
   He appealed to the United States and the Soviet Union to help
end the region's civil wars.
   Five Central American presidents will begin a two-day summit
Sunday, trying to rescue their shredded regional peace plan to end
armed conflicts in Nicaragua and El Salvador.
   Arias did not mention the United States and Soviet Union by
name, but spoke of ``superpowers in and out of the American
continent that are two-faced, talking about political solutions
while they encourage military offensives.''
   Diplomats expressed doubt the summit would get the peace process
back on track.
   ``Only a miracle would produce an agreement,'' said a Central
American diplomat who helped arrange the meeting. ``I do not see a
solution to the political crisis.''
   Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo said Saturday, ``We are
going through a very difficult moment. We are not very optimistic,
but it is a question of being willing to do something about it.''
   Arias said the recent offensive by leftist rebels in El Salvador
``eliminated whatever political space had opened there for the
opposition .... There is a polarization there that will be very
difficult to eliminate.''
   The summit, the latest in a series of gatherings aimed at
working out a regional peace, had been scheduled for Nicaragua.
   It was moved from Managua to San Jose after Salvadoran President
Alfredo Cristiani suspended diplomatic relations with Nicaragua,
accusing it of supplying surface-to-air missiles to the Salvadoran
rebels.
   A summit conference Aug. 7 in Tela, Honduras, resulted in a
surge of optimism as Nicaragua agreed to hold elections, the
Salvadorans agreed to talk to their guerrilla opponents, and all
five presidents agreed that U.S.-supported Contra guerrillas should
be demobilized by Dec. 5.
   But hopes fell in the last six weeks. Fighting surged inside
Nicaragua as Contra rebels mounted attacks and President Daniel
Ortega declared an end to a 19-month cease-fire.
   In El Salvador, Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
guerrillas launched their biggest attack of the war.
   The deadline for Contra demobilization passed with the Contras
still in their camps in Honduras and Nicaragua's Sandinista Army
massing along the border.
   The fifth president to attend the summit is Jose Azcona Hoyo of
Honduras.
   An important actor in the Central American drama _ the United
States _ does not attend the regional meetings but does try to
influence decisions.
   The United States supports Cristiani's government economically
and militarily and provides non-lethal support to the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   Honduran president-elect Rafael Callejas, who takes office Jan.
27, has said that his nation, like Guatemala and Costa Rica, needs
peace to attract investment and spur an economic recovery. There
has been virtually no new foreign investment in his nation in years.
   Nicaragua wants the Contras _ those inside Nicaragua and those
living and training on the Honduran side of the border _ disarmed
and disbanded. The government has offered an amnesty program.
   But Contra military leaders, with U.S. backing, want to keep
their groups together as a viable force until after Feb. 25
elections are held in Nicaragua to keep pressure on the Sandinistas
to hold a fair vote.
   The slowly evolving regional peace plan produced a cease-fire in
Nicaragua in March 1988, brought about talks between Salvador's
guerrillas and government and produced the program for
demobilization of Contra groups by Dec. 5.
   Ortega was expected to arrive early Sunday just moments before
the opening of the meeting. He said he would discuss the
demobilization of the Contras and his government was willing to
extend the deadline until Dec. 31.

   A man accused of laundering more than $1
billion for a Colombian cocaine cartel has been extradited from
Uruguay to the United States, the FBI said Saturday.
   Uruguayan national police turned Raul Silvio Vivas over to FBI
agents at a naval base under heavy guard Friday and he was flown to
Los Angeles that night, said Thomas R. Parker, assistant agent in
charge of criminal investigations and organized crime activities in
Los Angeles.
   An alleged key member of the Medellin cartel, which is believed
to supply a majority of the cocaine entering this country, Vivas
was a target of a Department of Justice investigation code-named
Operation Polar Cap, which has been described as the biggest
money-laundering probe in U.S. history.
   Vivas, a 39-year-old native of Argentina, had been held in a
Uruguayan jail since February.
   His extradition occurred just two days after a devastating
terrorist bombing blamed on cocaine traffickers killed dozens and
wounded hundreds outside Colombia's police intelligence
headquarters.
   A group of drug lords calling themselves ``the Extraditables''
has been waging a terror campaign of bombings and assassinations to
force the government to end its war on the cartel and stop the
extraditions.
   Vivas was a ``badly wanted'' fugitive and his extradition
``marks yet another turning point in the willingness of the
international community, particularly in South America, to work
with us in bringing to an end the tyranny and impunity of these
drug empires,'' Parker said.
   Operation Polar Cap led to the indictment of Vivas and 30 others
in February. The probe allegedly uncovered a bogus gold shipping
network dubbed ``La Mina,'' the mine, that laundered about $1.2
billion of drug money between 1987 and February 1989.
   ``The charges against Vivas allege that he personally controlled
the flow of over $1 billion of drug money out of the United States
to the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia,'' Parker said.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero, a 35-year-old Colombian economist and
reputed financial wizard behind the Medellin drug cartel, was sent
to Atlanta on Sept. 6 to face charges stemming from Polar Cap. He
was the first person extradited since the Colombian government
began its crackdown on drug traffickers.
   The FBI said Vivas was under tight security. Officials would not
disclose his location more specifically than the Los Angeles
metropolitan area. Vivas was scheduled to appear before a U.S.
magistrate in Los Angeles on Monday.
   Vivas has claimed he is a legal trader in gold. Uruguay has some
of the most liberal banking laws in South America. Citizens and
foreigners may enter and leave the country with gold, and freely
transfer capital in and out.

   The Bush administration, in the wake of the
Malta summit and the dramatic changes occurring in the Communist
bloc, is reviewing whether to relax the ban on sale of
high-technology exports to communist countries.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said in an interview Friday
that he expected the administration would reach a decision by
April, predicting that Poland and Hungary could be early
beneficiaries of a more liberalized policy.
   The dispute involves a 40-year-old prohibition intended to keep
high technology products with military applications from falling
into Communist hands.
   The administration is under growing pressure to ease the
controls as a way of boosting the economic and political reforms
sweeping through Eastern Europe.

   Federal regulators are reining in Florida's
largest savings and loan, CenTrust Bank of Miami, which lavished
millions of dollars on expensive art, yachts, corporate jets and
limousines.
   CenTrust called the action unnecessary, saying the thrift was in
its best financial condition in five years.
   In a legal order issued Friday, the Office of Thrift Supervision
told the institution to sell what's left of its $29 million art
collection, some of which had been kept at the home of CenTrust
Chairman David L. Paul.
   It forbid CenTrust from increasing its executives' salaries or
paying dividends to stockholders, told it to sell its limousines,
jet and a $233,000 sailboat known as ``Bodacious.'' Within 90 days,
the institution must stop paying the crew and other expenses for
the yacht owned by Paul, ``Grand Cru.''

   President Bush is back in the snowy capital
today after spending two days on the campaign trail in a
three-state swing to drum up support for Republican Senate
candidates and reverse GOP political fortunes.
   Bush stumped Friday for Rep. Tom Tauke in Des Moines, the last
stop in two days of appearances that included fund-raising events
for Senate candidates Hank Brown in Colorado and Phil Gramm in
Texas.
   Iowa Republicans hoped Bush's appearance would give Tauke an
early boost in his underdog bid to unseat first-term Democratic
Sen. Thomas Harkin.
   Bush canceled plans to spend the weekend at the Camp David
presidential retreat in the Maryland countryside when a snowstorm
swept the region Friday. He opted to stay at the White House
instead.

   This Christmas season is bittersweet for
striking coal miners, who've been living off meager union payments
for eight months but enjoying a groundswell of support from workers
around the country and the world.
   Other unions are shipping tons of donated food, clothing and
toys to the Virginia coal fields, where the United Mine Workers and
Pittston Coal Group Inc. are locked in a strike that began just
after Easter.
   Members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Women's
Network in Pennsylvania and New Jersey today are bringing toys,
treats and clothes to the Russell County Fairgrounds, where they'll
sing Christmas carols for miners' families.
   During Thanksgiving week, the United Auto Workers had a 15- to
20-pound turkey delivered to each striking miner's family.
