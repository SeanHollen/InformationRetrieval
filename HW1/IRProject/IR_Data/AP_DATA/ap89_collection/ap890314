   Musher Joe Runyan pulled ahead of three-time
winner Susan Butcher on Tuesday to take the lead in the final dash
across the frozen Bering Sea to Nome in the 1,168-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race.
   The Nevana man finished the 48-mile first leg of the final 171
miles 41 minutes ahead of Butcher, who started the day at Koyuk with
a nine-minute lead. Runyan and his 15-dog team reached a checkpoint
at this Bering Sea village at 2:03 p.m.
   Butcher, from Manley, logged in at 2:44 p.m. with 11 dogs. Third
was Rick Swenson, a four-time Iditarod winner from Two Rivers, who
arrived at 4:05 p.m.
   Dee Dee Jonrowe of Willow hit the trail Tuesday morning two hours
and three minutes after Swenson.
   The winner is expected to reach Nome on Wednesday morning after
brief stops at three remaining checkpoints.
   The first musher to cross the finish line on Nome's historic
Front Street wins $50,000. The remaining $200,000 is divided among
the next 19 finishers.
   With continued good weather expected, the final 171 miles of the
race across the ice of Norton Sound and along the hilly coastline to
Nome will boil down to speed and endurance.
   All four leaders took their final mandatory rest stops Monday in
Unalakleet.
   Although Butcher has fewer dogs remaining in her team than
Runyan, she said they appeared to be getting stronger.
   ``They're doing the Butcher tricks for me,'' she said early
Tuesday. ``They know where they are (in the race).''
   As of midday Tuesday, 41 mushers remained in the race; eight have
scratched since the race began March 4 in Anchorage.
   The annual race began 17 years ago and was inspired by a 1925
relay of serum to Nome during a diphtheria outbreak. The race is put
on largely by volunteers.

<HEAD>Steinberg Lawyer: Courtroom Cameras Helped My Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Live television coverage of the Joel
Steinberg murder trial helped turn a ``lynch mob'' atmosphere into a
serious deliberative process, the convicted child killer's lawyer
said Monday.
   Ira London told state legislators that he and Steinberg initially
objected to the cameras, but he changed his mind.
   ``A television camera has a chemical effect on people,'' London
said. ``It makes people more serious.''
   Cameras have been allowed in New York state courtrooms on an
experimental basis since Dec. 1, 1987. The Legislature is
considering whether to extend the experiment or make it permanent.
   Both chairmen of the Legislature's judiciary committees have
predicted the Senate and Assembly would extend the experiment beyond
its May 31 expiration date.
   London, whose client was convicted in January of first-degree
manslaughter in the death of his illegally adopted 6-year-old
daughter when the jury declined to convict Steinberg of murder, said
he'd like to see a permanent law passed using the regulations
currently in place.
   There was a ``lynch mob mentality'' against Steinberg in New York
City as the case began, but jurors worked hard to be fair, said
London. ``I think the television cameras had a lot to do with
that,'' he said.
   London dismissed as ``misguided'' critics who argue the presence
of cameras would trivialize trials and alter the behavior of
participants. He said the public received an education in the
criminal justice process.
   Several full days of testimony in the Steinberg trial were
broadcast on New York City television stations, and lengthy excerpts
were broadcast nationwide on Cable News Network.

   Iranian archaeologists have unearthed a
2,000- year-old town at Shustar in southwestern Khuzestan province,
Tehran television reported.
   The state-run television, monitored Monday in Nicosia, said
excavators found four underground crypts built of mud brick
containing clay coffins with elaborate relief designs that were
placed on wooden biers.
   It showed film of adult skeletons buried with simple jewelry and
household goods including clay water jugs and cups.
   Coins found at the site were struck during the Parthian dynasty,
which ruled in what is now Iran from 250 B.C. to 226 A.D.
   Regional leaders loyal to the Parthian kings had the right to
mint copper coins for local use, the television said.
   It said that two kilns for making pottery also were found.

   About 40 whales grounded on a beach in
the Strait of Magellan in the third similar incident in a week, the
navy reported.
   It said the black-skinned whales, measuring about 10 feet to 25
feet long, were spotted stranded about 20 miles north of this port
city. A rescue party was sent to try to help the whales return to
the sea, the navy said.
   Last week, around 140 whales grounded on the strait's coast. Most
were helped back to the sea by navy personnel and fishermen, but
many died, according to the navy.
   Some experts speculated that an unusual warming of the normally
frigid waters in the area may have caused the whales' directional
system to go awry.

<HEAD>Poles Make Deals On Black Market In West Berlin</HEAD>

   In a muddy field near the Berlin Wall, a young Pole
looks furtively about and pulls a bottle of vodka out of a plastic
bag.
   ``Five marks, you can have,'' he says.
   He motions to a fox fur coat on a hanger clipped to button on his
shirt. A bargain for 30 marks ($17), he says.
   If he sells four bottles of vodka at five marks ($2.70) each, or
the fur coat, he will have earned himself the equivalent of about a
month's salary in Poland.
   Across town, in the fashionable Zehlendorf district, three Poles
are painting the interior of a handsome turn-of-the-century villa
for the unbeatable price of 400 marks ($220).
   ``You couldn't get a union painter to even look at the place for
that price,'' said the homeowner, speaking only on condition of
anonymity.
   City officials estimate that as many as 4,000 Poles sell goods or
their labor illegally in West Berlin now that entry into the city
has been eased for them. Many advertize in the city's newspapers
offering to do home repair work and odd jobs at prices many West
Berliners find hard to resist.
   Thousands of Poles are also turning up on weekends at a
flea-market to sell everything from baby clothes to superbly crafted
amber necklaces for hard currency, such as marks and dollars.
   With the Polish economy in shambles, the vendors say, hard
currency has become the only means to acquire quality goods and food
items in short supply. It also offers the opportunity for staggering
profits on the black market currency exchange at home.
   ``Without hard currency you can't get anything that's any good,''
said a 30-year-old man from Gdansk, who drove through the night to
be at the market when it opened at 5 a.m.
   He was among a record 8,000 Poles who jammed a field in the
Kreuzberg district of the city on a recent weekend.
   Thousands of West Berliners jostled through the mud to inspect
shoes, clothing, household goods and food. The grocery goods,
displayed in open suitcases and car trunks, ranged from heaps of
Polish sausage to tins of Russian caviar at dumping prices.
   Many Poles at the market earn enough West German marks in a
weekend to support them for several months.
   ``Ten marks on the black market in Poland will get you up to
20,000 zloty, or almost as much as a pension,'' said a middle-aged
man from Krakow who was selling crystal goblets from the trunk of
his car.
   A companion, who said he came from Warsaw, added: ``I buy goods
in Poland for 1,000 zloty that I can sell here for 200 marks. With
those 200 marks, I can get 400,000 zloty on the black market in
Poland. We can live for six months on that.''
   A Polish house painter, who asked not to be named, said he could
earn a year's wages from three months' work in West Berlin.
   Under new regulations that went into effect Jan. 1, Poles do not
need visas to enter West Berlin and are allowed to stay as long as
three months.
   However, they come as tourists and are prohibited from engaging
in commercial enterprises.
   So far, West Berlin police have cracked down only on vendors
illegally selling heavily taxed items such as cigarettes, furs,
jewelry and alcohol.
   West Berlin police said that on one day alone, authorities seized
11 liters of vodka, 28,000 cigarettes, 360 grams (about 12 ounces)
of caviar and two fur coats. Fourteen Polish vendors were charged
with violations of import tax laws.
   Six Poles were arrested in February and expelled after they were
caught working illegally in the city.
   Customs checks have also been stepped up and the West Berlin
Senate has ordered that Poles caught smuggling goods be immediately
expelled and the offense noted in their passports.
   But customs officials say tourists are allowed to bring in goods
worth up to 100 marks ($54) for personal use and it is often
impossible to prove that the goods are intended for sale.
   ``There are too many of them and too few of us,'' said an
exasperated customs officer as as he made his way down a row of
sputtering Polish Fiats and vans at Checkpoint Charley at the Berlin
Wall.
   Around the corner, where 45 cars packed to the roofs with goods
waited for custom inspectection, deals were already flourishing.
   A West Berliner walked away with a porcelain tea set for 50 marks
($27), three times less than the department store price.

<HEAD>A Musical `Metropolis' Comes To Life In London</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Fritz Lang had known that his 1926 film
``Metropolis'' would become a musical, he might have laughed.
   Perhaps Victor Hugo would have also. After all, if Hugo's epic
19th-century novel ``Les Miserables'' could become a hit musical,
why not Lang's classic vision of the future?
   ``I think `Les Miz' is the best thing ever; that's what I'd like
our show to live up to,'' said Joseph Brooks, who wrote the Grammy
award-winning song ``You Light Up My Life,'' from the 1977 movie of
that name.
   ``Metropolis,'' which opened in London March 8, cost 2.5 million
pounds ($4.38 million), and is the first of several large-scale
musicals to open this year in London.
   Its bow at the Piccadilly Theater follows a bad period for
British musical productions in 1988, when ``Chess'' and ``Carrie''
flopped on Broadway and ``Can-Can,'' ``Budgie'' and ``Ziegfeld''
died in London.
   Brooks has co-written the music, book and lyrics of
``Metropolis.'' Frenchman Jerome Savary, who staged a hit Paris
revival of ``Cabaret'' in 1986, is directing, with choreography by
Tom Jobe, the American who starred in ``Chess'' in London.
   Brian Blessed, the original Old Deuteronomy in ``Cats,'' heads
the cast as John Freeman, the evil master of the machine-age
metropolis where the action takes place. The romantic leads are
played by Graham Bickley and Judy Kuhn, who was nominated for a Tony
for her role in the American production of ``Chess,'' in a show
that, despite its emphasis on technology, aims to put emotion first.
   ``I'm hopeful that the music and the emotional content of what we
want to say are what will be taken home,'' said Brooks.
   Brooks moved to London in 1985 with his wife and two children,
intending to write a musical, and he was searching for strongly
visual material that would transfer well to the stage.
   His wife, Susan, asked the British Film Institute for a list of
its movies, Brooks recalled. When the title ``Metropolis'' appeared,
her reaction was, ``That's the film.'' A series of screenings
ensued, followed by negotiations with the Fritz Lang estate in
Vienna.
   ``Metropolis'' is a stupefying tale about workers in a
modernistic city who live underground. A sweet girl named Maria
soothes their unrest until a mad scientist creates an artificial
evil Maria who leads the workers to revolt. The silent film, a
benchmark of German expressionism, was reissued in 1984 with a
colored tint and a score by Giorgio Moroder.
   The play is Brooks' first writing for the theater. He composed
the music for the films ``Marjoe,'' ``The Garden of the
Finzi-Continis'' and ``The Lords of Flatbush,'' and has written over
140 advertising jingles, mostly for television.
   ``I grew up in Manhattan loving all the old standards:
`Carousel,' `Oklahoma!' They all had tremendous melodies; that's
what I've tried to do.''
   But the initial appeal of ``Metropolis'' may well lie in its
scenery, which takes up one-third of the musical's budget. Its
massive gray-and-black, pipe-filled sets evoke an oppressively cold,
mechanistic environment populated by two worlds _ the underground
one of the two lovers and the elitist one ruled by the evil inventor
(Freeman).
   Brooks and his colleagues dispute suggestions that ``Metropolis''
is another British techno-spectacle such as ``Cats'' and ``Starlight
Express.''
   ``If ever a show required a big visual statement, it's this
one,'' said Ralph Koltai, the Hungarian designer responsible for the
ill-fated ``Carrie'' and a frequent collaborator at the Royal
Shakespeare Company. ``You couldn't do `Metropolis' on an empty
stage with a chair.''
   Judy Kuhn, who makes her West End debut as the saintly Maria,
said: ``This show is about machines; it's about what man has created.
   ``As long as technology helps the show, it's OK. It's technology
for its own sake that's the problem.''

   Since he came to power four years ago, President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has moved to open up a closed society. The
following article, the latest in a series examining Gorbachev's
first four years, looks at some of the problems the new openness has
wrought.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's decision to permit
freer expression has exposed long-ignored grievances that could
threaten his effort to revamp Soviet society.
   When he came to power in March 1985, Gorbachev inherited not only
an economy in virtual ruins but a union of disparate nationalities
bristling under Moscow's yoke, an environment poisoned by pollution,
and a system wracked by corruption.
   Gorbachev's predecessors generally refused to acknowledge such
problems and were indifferent to public opinion, erecting instead a
facade of multinational brotherhood, claiming that chemicals pouring
into the rivers and blackening the sky were not harmful, and
declaring that crime was largely a Western problem.
   Gorbachev has lifted the veil.
   ``Democratization and glasnost have put the spotlight on problems
which were not always taken into due consideration _ issues of
language, culture, literature, art, historical heritage and
environmental protection,'' he told a Communist Party conference
June 28.
   Because previous administrations were insensitive to the
problems, he said, ``some issues began to grow more complicated ...
although in principle they could have been settled quietly, without
providing a pretext for all sorts of speculations and emotional
extremes.''
   Nationalism alone could break the union apart. The Soviet Union
is composed of more than 100 national groups, and several are
clamoring for greater control of their own affairs. One republic
even climed its sovereignty.
   The bloody dispute between Armenians and their neighbors, the
Azerbaijanis, has been one of Gorbachev's biggest problems.
   The two southern ethnic groups clashed in February 1988 over a
small parcel of land called Nagorno-Karabakh. It is populated mainly
by Armenians but is part of Azerbaijan. Armenians want it annexed to
their republic, a demand Moscow has refused. Violence over the
issued has killed 91 people.
   Gorbachev first tried quiet diplomacy _ personal appeals for
calm, changes in the local leadership and a program to improve
cultural and social conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh. When that
failed, troops were sent in and curfews were imposed to quell
violence. Several Armenian activists were arrested.
   Finally, in January, the government put the region under direct
rule from Moscow.
   Ashot Grigoryan, an Armenian activist, said Gorbachev should be
given credit for allowing people to speak their minds. But he added
the Kremlin chief is afraid of letting Armenians go too far.
   ``If this movement continued to the end,'' Grigoryan said in an
interview, ``it would turn into a real revolution against the ruling
circles.''
   The April 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, which
killed at least 31 people and sent a cloud of radiation around the
world, spawned a mass environmental protection movement.
   Armenians, in the midst of the fight for Nagorno-Karabakh, began
protesting pollution from chemical plants around their capital,
Yerevan, and demonstrating against a nuclear power station they
feared could release radiation in an earthquake.
   Authorities agreed to scale back production at the Yerevan
chemical plants and install pollution-control devices, and they have
agreed to shut the nuclear plant.
   Gorbachev himself noted that millions of tons of harmful
chemicals are spewed into the air yearly, destroying arable land,
vegetation and animals, and he said the Kremlin must ``in all ways
welcome'' the environmental campaign.
   This greater openness, known as glasnost, also has pushed
authorities to acknowledge the existence of crime and the
inadequacies of health care in the Soviet Union. For the first time
in a half-century, the government released statistics showing a
dramatic rise in murders, robberies and black marketeering.
   Gorbachev also launched a crackdown on corruption.
   In the most highly publicized case, Leonid I. Brezhnev's
son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov, was sentenced to 12 years in a labor
camp for taking nearly $145,000 in bribes while he held the No. 2
law enforcement post in the government.
   In the health field, authorities admit their system of free
medical care is woefully inadequate. The one health problem blamed
on the West _ AIDS _ is a growing threat here, and officials
acknowledge they need help dealing with their system's shortcomings.
   Residents of the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia have begun expressing frustration with the Kremlin, which
took control of the republics in 1940.
   Under Gorbachev, they have staged regular demonstrations and
organized grassroots movements to push _ with some success _ for
greater autonomy aimed at saving the culture, economy and
environment they say has been hurt under Kremlin control.
   Many activists say privately their ultimate goal is secession
from the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev has cautiously permitted the movements to proceed and
has installed new reform-minded leaders in the Baltics who have
acceded to popular demands to make the local tongues the official
languages, restore the flags that flew when the republics were
independent and grant more autonomy in economic and environmental
matters.
   But Gorbachev and his Kremlin colleagues have limits. They
declared invalid the Estonian parliament's declaration of
sovereignty in November. But the Soviet president indicated his
willingness to be flexible and acknowledged his administration is
not immune to error.
   When Baltic politicians complained that a proposed constitutional
amendment would drop their republics' ostensible right to secede
from the union, Gorbachev admitted the leadership had erred.
   ``We did not care about explaining the essence, the meaning'' of
the proposed changes, he said. ``All of us are now learning our
lessons.''

<HEAD>First Auction Of Unknown Art Excites Buyers, Dismays Artists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standing at the sidelines of London's first major
auction of new, unknown art works were some slightly dazed artists,
suddenly in the spotlight and unsure what to think.
   ``I think everyone's feeling a little sick,'' said Emma Lawton,
26, one of 25 artists whose works reaped $175,685, nearly double
what Christie's auction house had expected for its ``New
Contemporaries'' sale Tuesday night.
   ``Anything that encourages artists is good,'' Ms. Lawton said
after six of her works were snapped up at higher prices than
anticipated. ``At the same time this is like going off the deep end
_ suddenly you're up front.''
   But buyers loved it. An estimated 1,000 people crowded into a
hall at the Royal College of Art on a stormy night to bid on 132
works by artists mostly just out of school.
   Christie's set up neat rows of chairs for 100 people, but soon
after the gavel first fell a wall of well-dressed people in suits
and furs stood craning their necks or standing on chairs around them
to watch or bid.
   Most of the artists, wearing combinations of jeans, hats and
leather, stood at the side of the room, half-watching the spectacle
and talking among themselves.
   ``We expected 60,000 pounds ($100,000) in sales,'' said Susan
Adams, a spokesman for the auction house's division in South
Kensington. Two young staff members there came up with the idea for
the sale, the first of its kind by a major auction house in London.
   Ms. Adams said an unusually high number of buyers were private
individuals, not gallery buyers, and ``a lot of people came out of
curiosity.''
   The highest sale price, $8,460, was paid for a brash red, brown
and gold painting called ``Quartet'' by 23-year-old Rebecca Price.
It was quadruple the estimate.
   Although some of the artists had been exhibited before, none was
affiliated with a gallery _ normally the first big break for a young
artist.
   Christie's took a 20 percent commission from the artists,
compared with 10 percent usually, but waived many usual fees such as
reproduction costs for the catalogue. The auctioneers pointed out
that galleries usually take 40 to 60 percent from the artists.
   ``We wanted to introduce the idea of being able to sell unknown
artists' works at an auction,'' said India Dhargalkar, who along
with Sarah Bates spent 18 months of her spare time searching out
hundreds of unknown artists on tips from every art school in the
British isles.
   She said they chose the works, which were nearly all abstract,
brightly colored paintings, on ``gut reaction.'' There were also a
few portraits and pieces of furniture.
   Ms. Price, who graduated from London's prestigious Slade School
of Art last year, said she was ``quite surprised'' to have been
approached by Christie's.
   ``I think it's all really odd,'' she said, looking around the
auction room and pursing bright red lips. ``It's amazing that
anybody can figure out what's going on with all these people milling
about.''
   Ms. Price, who has designed stage sets and murals and illustrated
books besides painting, said it felt ``very nice'' to sell her works
but uncomfortable at the same time.
   ``I'm just trying to find out about the painting and myself when
I paint,'' she said. ``The fact that it's sold is like a byproduct.''
   John Bicknell, at 31 one of the elders of the group, said there
was a ``cattle-market'' element to the affair, but ``at our age it's
an opportunity that anybody would take.''
   He didn't think a Christie's auction would spell instant success,
however.
   ``It's pure fortune to have been chosen,'' he said. ``I don't
think anybody's pretending this is the best art around.''

<HEAD>American Captured In Korea Remains In China Nearly 40 Years Later</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Chinese captured James George Veneris in
Korea on a starry night in 1950, and the American chose not to go
home after the war. Even though he suffered in the Cultural
Revolution, Veneris is glad he stayed.
   Red Guards accused him of counterrevolution in the 1960s and he
was forced to work as a rag picker, but life got better when
President Richard M. Nixon visited China in 1972 and decades of
hatred between the United States and China began to end.
   ``You see, I just did what Nixon did, that's all,'' he said.
``Only I did it 22 years earlier. The folks in America don't
recognize this, but one day they'll come around.
   The ``old American soldier,'' as the Chinese call him, visited
the United States in 1976. He found himself a misfit and returned to
China, where he will celebrate his 67th birthday March 30.
   ``I'm living the life of Riley here,'' he said. ``I'm still
studying Chinese characters, three a day. I've got life knocked up.
I want to live to 120.''
   Twenty-two American prisoners of war and one Briton chose to live
in China after the Korean War ended in 1953. Only Veneris and Howard
Adams, another American, remain; one of the others died of a heart
ailment in 1954 and the rest have left China.
   Veneris, the son of a coal miner, was raised in Vandergrift, Pa.
He is a gentle person with a shock of gray hair, a firm handshake
and a slight heart condition that once again has put him under a
doctor's care.
   He is a man in a time warp whose conversation is sprinkled with
expressions from Maoist dogma and an America of half a century ago.
   ``Oh, I got some bananas, I got some bananas,'' Veneris sang
during a recent interview from his hospital bed. Then he dug into a
bedside cupboard and pulled out several pieces of the fruit. ``Just
wish I had the rest of the makings for a good banana split,'' he
said.
   When he and the others chose to live in China, they were branded
defectors in the West and given dishonorable discharges. China
hailed them as ``peace fighters'' and the fledgling communist
government used them as propaganda.
   Veneris fought in the Pacific during World War II and joined up
again to stop communism in Korea.
   ``Heck, I believed Red China was going to invade California,'' he
said, but three years in a POW camp in North Korea ended the hatred.
   ``No, they didn't brainwash me. That's a bunch of baloney,'' he
said, poking with a finger to press his point. ``I saw they were
good people. They didn't hate us, they only hated the people in
Washington.''
   On Nov. 28, 1950, Veneris had been in Korea just 27 days and was
at the end of a retreating convoy.
   ``I remember the day real well,'' he said. ``It was in the
evening. We were retreating. Suddenly everything stopped. Then came
the Chinese bugles. All I could see was a quarter moon and the
twinkling stars. Next day, we were surrounded.''
   The 23 prisoners who went to China were given the choice of
studying, working in a factory or the countryside, or doing nothing
on a small monthly stipend.
   ``I took the factory and never regretted it,'' Veneris said.
   He was sent to Jinan in eastern China, where he worked at a paper
mill as a lathe operator, blacksmith and machine repairman.
   In 1956, he met a Chinese woman who would become the first of
three wives. She died a few years later of tuberculosis.
   During the early 1960s, he studied at the People's University in
Beijing and wrote a thesis on ``How Good The People Are.''
   ``And that's in capital letters,'' he said. ``It's just about
good people.''
   Mao Tse-tung's radical Cultural Revolution began and, as a
foreigner, Veneris was suspected of counterrevolution.
   He returned to Jinan and was forced to do hard labor.
   ``I pulled around a cart and picked rags,'' he said. ``I did a
lot of sweating.''
   His propaganda duties included a widely publicized speech against
the Vietnam War. A second marriage ended because Veneris was a
foreigner and old friends stayed away.
   After the improvement in U.S.-Chinese relations, Veneris returned
to the United States in 1976 for the bicentennial.
   ``I spent a year there and must have slept in 300 homes,'' he
said. ``I spoke 700 times on China. I did my internationalist duty.''
   America had become a strange place to the exile.
   ``All those new gadgets: refrigerators that made ice, phones with
buttons on them, video things,'' he said. ``I figured I might as
well come back to China. I knew it better.''
   He went to the United States again to 1984 to see sisters in
California. The only things he says he misses now are ``strong,
non-filter cigarettes and good ice cream.''
   After retiring from his factory job, Veneris began teaching
English at the university. He spends his free time with his third
wife, a professor of botany, and two children from his second
marriage.
   His daughter, 18, sells tickets on the No. 35 bus in Jinan but
his 16-year-old son ``doesn't do much of anything except play,'' he
said.
   Blowing out a cloud of cigarette smoke, the ``old American
soldier'' lay back on the pillows and quoted Chairman Mao: ``The
road is tortuous but the future is bright.''
   Then he grinned and said: ``Now ain't that the cat's meow?''

<HEAD>Colombian Drug Kingpin Convicted of Federal Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury convicted a Colombian drug
kingpin Tuesday of masterminding a massive 1985 airlift of cocaine
to Nevada.
   Benjamin Herrera, the so-called ``Black Pope'' of cocaine, was
convicted of conspiracy and importation by U.S. District Court
jurors who deliberated less than two hours before returning the
verdict.
   Herrera, who faces up to 80 years in prison and fines totaling $1
million, was scheduled to be sentenced May 25.
   The conviction has international implications for the cocaine
trade because federal drug agents consider Herrera one of Colombia's
most prominent drug lords, said Tom Green, chief of the Las Vegas
Drug Task Force.
   ``He and brothers Gustavo Herrera and Romero Herrera probably
operate the largest family cocaine operation in Colombia,'' Green
said.
   Herrera was convicted in the January 1985 shipment of 189 pounds
of cocaine to southern Nevada from Bolivia. The drug had a street
value of $17 million.
   Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Florida were alerted to
the planned deal by a government informant, Adler ``Barry'' Seal,
who enabled undercover agents to infiltrate the scheme.
   The drugs were flown to an airport outside of Las Vegas and
several men were arrested while picking the shipment up. They were
later convicted of drug charges in federal court.
   Herrera was arrested by federal agents in Miami in December 1987.
   Seal was assassinated by gunmen in Baton Rouge, La., in February
1986 while preparing to testify against alleged drug lords in Miami.

   Talk show host Geraldo Rivera helped two
nuns and a businesswoman change a flat tire on their car after it
broke down in his posh New York City neighborhood, one of the women
says.
   ``What a nice man,'' said Janet Schiavone, a hair salon owner of
who lives in this town near Binghamton.
   Schiavone said she and two friends, both nuns from New York City,
were driving near Central Park on the evening of March 5 when their
car got a flat tire.
   Schiavone said she was struggling to change the tire when a man
walking his dog offered to help.
   ``I was having a hard time, so I said `sure,''' she recalled.
``(Then) one of the sisters recognized him.''
   Rivera, whose reputation for sensationalism took off last year
when his nose was broken during an on-air brawl with white
supremacists, changed the tire. When the women's car wouldn't start,
he brought his car to try to jump-start it and then tried pushing
the vehicle with his own, Schiavone said.
   ``He pushed us for 10 blocks. We were going to stop him after
five, but we were having so much fun.''
   Rivera left the women in his car to keep warm while they waited
for help and gave them his address so they could return the key,
Schiavone said. He walked home with his dog, Spike, a black Labrador
retriever.
   A spokesman for Rivera, Lynn Lazaroff, confirmed Schiavone's
account. She said Rivera is ``that kind of guy.''

   In one of the largest actions of its kind, the
Food and Drug Administration on Monday warned consumers not to eat
any fruit imported from Chile after traces of cyanide were found in
Chilean seedless red grapes.
   The cyanide was discovered after an anonymous threat to poison
Chilean fruit was telephoned to the U.S. embassy in the capital of
the South American nation.
   The FDA urged that all Chilean fruit be removed from U.S. markets
while more tests continue. Virtually all the fresh grapes sold in
the United States at this time of year come from Chile, FDA
officials said.
   Karen Brown, a spokeswoman for the Food Marketing Institute,
which represents supermarkets, said: ``Those companies that have
Chilean fruit are responding to the FDA request and are withdrawing
the product from their stores.''
   Hours after the FDA announcement, Canadian officials followed the
U.S. lead and urged stores in Canada to remove all remove Chilean
produce. Chilean produce sent to Canada first goes through the
United States.
   Canadian Health Minister Perrin Beatty said Canadians should
throw out any produce from Chile and should also discard any produce
of whose origin they are uncertain. ``If you have any doubt, don't
use it,'' Beatty warned at a news conference.
   The tests were made on grape samples in Philadelphia and they
followed an anonymous threat telephoned to the U.S. embassy March 2.
   Four days later, the FDA advised that the call was ``almost
certainly a hoax,'' but as a precaution, the agency said it had
detained Chilean fruit and would continue to examine samples.
   After confirming cyanide in the Philadelphia samples, the FDA
urged that all Chilean fruit be removed from U.S. markets and that
shipments of Chilean fruits which had not yet been distributed
should be held for testing.
   FDA officials said they did not know the amount of fruit that was
involved.
   ``This may be an isolated incident, but we can hardly take that
chance,'' said FDA Commissioner Frank Young.
   The agency first confirmed low levels of cyanide in two grapes on
Sunday and worked through the night testing more samples, said Fred
Shank, acting deputy director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety.
   ``We are confident we are out there in sufficient time to warn
the American consumer not to eat fruit derived from Chile,'' he
said. ``No fruit from Chile is being released for distribution in
the (U.S.) food supply. We are putting all the efforts that we
reasonably can to ... ensure its safety.''
   The amount of cyanide found in the grapes is less than would be
needed to make a small child sick, but is more than would be found
in nature, the FDA said.
   While the FDA did not announce the amount of cyanide found,
Beatty told a news conference in Otta that the grapes tested in
Philadelphia contained only three micrograms each of cyanide. At
that level, a young child would have to eat at least 2,000 grapes to
ingest a lethal dose, he said.
   The FDA said consumers should not be worried about fruit consumed
in the past because cyanide is fast-acting.
   ``Consumers are being advised to check the source of any fresh,
non-citrus fruit and not to eat any Chilean fruit they have on
hand,'' the FDA said in a statement.
   In Chile, Interior Minister Carlos Caceres went on national radio
and television Monday night and blamed ``terrorism supported by
international communism which does not hesitate in demaging not only
our economic interests but also our social and moral interests.''
   He said Chile ``will contrinue to be a dependable supplier'' to
the international fruit market. Security has been reinforced
throughout the fruit-exporting process, he said.
   Grapes make up about two-thirds of the Chilean fruit imported to
the United States said, the FDA said. Other Chilean fruit sold here
at this time of year include peaches, blueberries, blackberries,
seedless watermelons, cantaloupes, Juan Canary and honeydew melons,
raspberries, nectarines, quince, Granny Smith green apples, cactus
pears, pears and plums.
   The two grapes in which the cyanide was confirmed had been
punctured and were discolored, with a ring of crystalline material
around the puncture area, the FDA said. A third grape located near
the other two was ``slashed'' but no cyanide was detected.
   No cyanide was detected in any other fruit, but ``as a precaution
consumers are advised to avoid any fruit from Chile at this time,''
the FDA said.
   The agency said potassium or sodium cyanide converts to hydrogen
cyanide in acid fruit and then can dissipate. But scientists could
not determine how much of the poison was originally introduced, the
FDA said.
   In the March 2 call received by the U.S. embassy in Santiago, a
male caller speaking in Spanish claimed that fruit being exported
from Chile would be poisoned. The call was investigated by Chilean
security officials and the U.S. State Department, the FDA said.
   On March 6, the FDA said ``no corroboration of the threat could
be found and U.S. officials said Chile had taken `impressive
efforts' to be sure all required controls are in place.''
   A second call to the embassy on March 8 was also considered a
hoax, the FDA said.
   The grapes in which cyanide was found were shipped to the United
States three days before the first telephone threat, the FDA said.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, whose domain
includes the FDA, said in a statement, ``We regret any adverse
effect this action may have on the Chilean fruit industry and the
people of Chile.''

<HEAD>Shakespearean Maurice Evans Dies in England</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maurice Evans, the actor and producer who
brought Shakespeare's Macbeth to American television and gave the
new medium Old World polish, has died in England, an associate said
Monday.
   Evans, who was 87, died Sunday at a nursing home in Brighton,
said George Schaefer, Dean of Theater, Film and TV at University of
California, Los Angeles.
   ``He had been ill. He had a heart attack a few years back, and
bronchial problems, and I guess it just all caught up with him,''
said Schaefer.
   His American career also included motion pictures, including such
films as ``Rosemary's Baby'' and ``The Planet of the Apes,'' in
which he appeared in full-face simian makeup.
   The actor also was a familiar face to television viewers,
starring in TV versions of his Shakespearean plays on ``The Hallmark
Hall of Fame'' and in such lighter fare as ``Batman,'' ``Tarzan,''
``Bewitched'' and ``Daniel Boone'' in the 1960s.
   Schaefer, who met Evans during World War II, said the actor was
mostly retired during the past 10 years except for occasional stage
roles and bit parts in films.
   ``He was one of the last great actor-managers,'' said Schaefer,
speaking of the period when Evans produced such Broadway hits as
``Teahouse of the August Moon,'' ``Dial M for Murder,'' and ``No
Time for Sergeants.''
   Schaefer, a former producer for the ``Hallmark Hall of Fame,''
credited Evans with the idea of bringing quality television to
American audiences.
   He produced ``Maurice Evans Presents Hallmark Hall of Fame'' from
October 1955 to March 1956, offering ``Alice in Wonderland,'' ``The
Corn is Green'' and ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' and won a best
program Emmy in 1961 for ``Macbeth.''
   Evans was born in Dorchester, Dorset, England. His father,
Herbert, was a Welsh druggist and justice of the peace who was also
an amateur actor and placed his son in adaptations of Thomas Hardy
novels at age seven.
   Joining the London stage, Evans became one of the city's most
sought-after ctors after his 1929 performance in ``Journey's End.''
   At the same time, the financially pragmatic actor ran a
dry-cleaning firm during the day.
   ``I have no intentions of winding up starving in an attic,'' he
once vowed.
   He later joined the Old Vic Theatre and portrayed such classical
Shakespearean roles as Hamlet, Richard II and Caesar.
   With his smooth, baritone voice, he was lured to Broadway in 1935
for ``Romeo and Juliet,'' and reprised his ``Hamlet'' role in a
five-hour Broadway play in 1938.
   Evans became an American citizen in 1941 and entered the U.S.
Army in 1942, where he staged about sixty plays for troops,
including a popular shortened version of ``Hamlet'' which became
known as ``G.I. Hamlet.''
   He returned to Broadway after the war, becoming a critical
success and a millionaire.
   ``The Teahouse of the August Moon'' earned him a Tony Award as
producer in 1954, and he won an honorary Tony in 1950.
   There are no immediate survivors, Schaefer said.

   Longtime James Bond actor Roger Moore says he's
giving up the lead role in a new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical because
he can't sing well enough.
   ``I now do not think that the musical stage is for me,'' Moore
said Monday.
   The actor who played secret agent 007 in six Bond films had been
rehearsing for six weeks. The musical, ``Aspects of Love,'' is
scheduled to open in a month and is already sold out until Christmas.
   Moore said he quit after ``much soul-searching,'' and left enough
time for a ``more musically suitable replacement to be found.''
   ``I think perhaps I underestimated the vocal demands of the role
because I so much wanted Roger to play it,'' said Lloyd Webber, the
composer of ``Cats'' and ``Phantom of the Opera.''
   Moore, 61, was to have headed a 20-member cast as George
Dillingham, a romantic aristocrat, in the love story about an
English boy and a penniless French actress. Lloyd Webber had invited
Moore to take the role after hearing him sing at a private party.

   Actress Candice Bergen says that before her
daughter's birth, she thought she would have a baby only if it
``were more like a chimpanzee.''
   ``But then suddenly Chloe was born. ... I was so overwhelmed and
ecstatic to have this baby,'' the 41-year-old actress said in an
interview in April's Redbook.
   ``I never used to like babies. I had absolutely no confidence
that I had any maternal instincts whatsoever. I'd always think,
`Well, if a baby were more like a chimpanzee, I'd have one,''' said
Bergen, who is married to French filmmaker Louis Malle.
   Bergen, who lived in Los Angeles last fall while playing a TV
newswoman in the CBS series ``Murphy Brown,'' said she will try to
distance her 3-year-old daughter from the Beverly Hills lifestyle.
   ``I find the narcissism and self-involvement ... really
appalling. People's preoccupation with their looks and their clothes
at a time when there's so much suffering in the country _ I just
find it grotesque,'' she said.

   O'Connor was moved out of intensive care at Emory University
Hospital on Monday, two days after his surgery, and is expected to
remain hospitalized another week or so, hospital spokeswoman Eve
Patterson said.
   ``He's making excellent progress,'' Patterson said.
   O'Connor, perhaps best known as the blue-collar bigot Archie
Bunker in the situation comedy ``All in the Family,'' will miss this
season's four remaining episodes of ``In the Heat of the Night.''
   The show's producers, MGM@UA Television, announced that Baker

recovery.
   ``Now, I want to help provide a support system for others.''
   President Bush and Reagan sent congratulatory messages to Brady.
   ``Your comeback has made us all proud,'' Bush wrote in a letter.

   Actress Shirley Maclaine says she's content to
play plump, ill-tempered characters, but she hasn't given up on
glamour entirely.
   Maclaine, 55, said she had a good time gaining 25 pounds to play
a tyrannical piano teacher in last year's critically acclaimed

   ``I needed to feel my thighs clang together. I had to get Shirley
out of the way and let this character play herself,'' she said in
April's Ladies' Home Journal.
   Her newest role, in the soon-to-be-released film version of the
play ``Steel Magnolias,'' is Ouiser Boudreaux: ``an old, ugly,
sarcastic witch who's been in a bad mood for 40 years.''
   ``I'm going to play characters who are misfits or mildly
eccentric, with very sweeping personalities, maybe 60 or 65 years
old, who may or may not have any sexual relationships, who are
confronting something important about themselves.''
   But one day, the Oscar-winning actress said, ``I may also decide
I want to be glamorous again.''

   Actress Esther Williams says she's limiting her
comeback hopes to swimsuit designing and hasn't acted in decades
because she didn't want to ``lower my standards.''
   Miss Williams wowed moviegoers in the 1940s and 1950s with lavish
swimming and underwater ballet sequences in 26 MGM movies including
the ``Million Dollar Mermaid,'' ``Dangerous When Wet'' and ``Bathing
Beauty.''
   ``Everything changed,'' she said in a telephone interview from
her Beverly Hills, Calif., home. ``I was in that moment of
transition between when the big studios lost all the theaters and TV
was getting prominent and important.''
   Recently, she considered a role in a two-hour television movie,
but turned down the four day, $25,000-a-day job after reading the
``exploitive'' script.
   ``Boy was I glad when I saw it,'' she said. ``I don't want to
lower my standards. I would have hated that hundred thousand
dollars.''
   On Monday, Miss Williams, 65, showed off her first line of
swimsuits, a collection of 124 designs ranging from $30 to $60.

<HEAD>Britain Lives Up To Reputation For Fashion Individualists</HEAD>

   Britain lived up to its reputation as a fashion
capital for individualists in autumn collections that offered
everything from fringes, fake fur and animal prints to classic wools
and perennial velvets.
   The result was ``anything goes'' _ with no single direction for
British fashion.
   Skirts were long or short. Pants were narrow or very full.
Jackets were long and lean or short and swingy. The looks were
ethnic, or cowboy, or biker, or Russian, or prim Miss Marple English.
   ``I think anything goes this season,'' said David Sassoon of
Bellville Sassoon, who designs evening dresses for Princess Diana.
``But I think people have found it difficult to buy. I think they've
found too many kooky clothes and not enough that people will wear.''
   Marie Gavrielides of Warwick, R.I., whose company Kellouie's
sells to private clients, agreed, saying the British shows _ with a
few exceptions _ were ``too high fashion'' for the States.
   ``Paris is more classic,'' she said. ``Americans are way too
classic for most of these collections. Everything moves so much
faster in England, designs are very up, very progressive.''
   The greatest excitement seemed to be generated at the young end
of the fashion scene, with the accessory and clothing firm Pink Soda
setting the trend for the 15-25 generation.
   Their collection _ inspired by India, Morocco and Turkey _
featured lots of embroidery, animal prints, fringed scarves,
corset-like bustiers with lurex, coins, bells and pom poms, and
plenty of ethnic necklaces. All were topped with fake fur or
patterned velvet bowler hats.
   ``We've had a lot of interest from the States _ more than in the
last five years,'' said managing director David Solomon.
   Helen Storey's beaded chiffon bra-tops, fringed zebra bolero and
one-piece leather chaps with attached boots also were big hits in
the young market.
   Some top British designers took the bizarre route during London
Fashion Week, which ends today.
   Katharine Hamnett's biker-look collection, harking back to the
1970s, included a skin-tight black velour jumpsuit worn with
high-cut black leather briefs and a leather bomber jacket with metal
studs bearing her latest ecology slogan _ ``Clean up or Die.''
   Rifat Ozbek, winner of the British Fashion Council's Designer of
the Year award, returned to his Turkish roots with belly-dancer bras
fringed with gold coins, leopard-print pants and Berber-striped
coats.
   At the other end of the fashion spectrum for autumn and winter
were the more traditional designers who have become part of
Britain's fashion establishment.
   Jean Muir showed loose jumpsuits. Gina Fratini had black velvet
strapless ones molded to the body and covered with Indian
mirrored-cloth jackets. Caroline Charles reflected Miss Marple with
long, lean earth-colored tweeds, trimmed in fake-fur. Ally Capellino
also did a prim English look with skirts down to the ankle.
   Edina Ronay, who showed animal prints, velvet suits with gold
beading, and colored Venetian silks, said ``the Americans are coming
back'' after several seasons in the wings.
   David Sassoon, whose midi-chiffons and short sequinned wool
jerseys were big sellers, also said sales were up to the United
States. ``The Americans want glamorous clothes that women will wear
and they come here for evening wear _ no doubt about it,'' he said.
   But Betty Jackson, who did a softer, more feminine collection
with a new A-line silhouette based on Tibetan and Mongolian themes,
said ``the Americans have been difficult for a few seasons now.''
   ``I think they come as voyeurs,'' she said.

<HEAD>TV Ministries Face Loss of Tax Exemptions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several television ministries whose finances
are being audited by the Internal Revenue Service in the wake of the
PTL scandal are in danger of losing their federal tax exemptions,
the IRS says.
   Loss of the exemptions would mean future contributors could not
claim tax deductions for donations to those ministries.
   The IRS investigated 23 TV ministries during the last quarter of
1988, the agency said in a report to Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas,
chairman of the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee. Pickle
made parts of the report public on Monday.
   ``The service is continuing to devote significant examination
resources to media evangelist cases,'' Robert I. Brauer, assistant
commissioner for exempt organizations, said in a cover letter to
Pickle. He identified six of those cases as involving prominent TV
evangelists.
   ``We anticipate that several ... cases involving prominent media
evangelists will move to the final stages of the examination process
this year,'' Brauer wrote. ``We also anticipate that some of these
cases will present serious issues relating to continued federal
income tax exemption.''
   The report names none of the 23 ministries; privacy laws prohibit
such disclosure. However, it is known that one of those being probed
by the IRS is PTL, which is fending off the IRS and several credits
in bankruptcy court.
   The report uses numbers to refer to the cases. No. 15, PTL, is
under investigation for allegedly failing to pay tax on some of its
unrelated income, including rental of part of its satellite network;
for not reporting some of its income; and for allowing part of its
funds to be used for the benefit of private individuals.
   In public proceedings, the IRS has alleged that PTL paid
excessive salaries to founder Jim Bakker and some of his associates.
   PTL foundered and the IRS intensified its scrutiny of TV
ministries after Jessica Hahn charged that Bakker associates paid
her to keep quiet about allegations that she had been seduced by
Bakker.
   Pickle, in releasing the IRS report, said the agency and one
prominent evangelist had reached agreement that led to the
minister's payment of back taxes, interest and penalties totaling
more than $1 million over a four-year period. Key issues in that
case were the minister's pay, housing and transportation.
   The IRS said the cases under review also involve allegations of
political activities, not fully reporting income, allowing earnings
to benefit officials of the ministry, or failing to pay employment
taxes on employees' wages.
   Brauer's cover letter said two organizations connected with
former Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson have refused
to provide records of the type that other TV ministries have
provided voluntarily.
   Because the Freedom Council and the National Freedom Institute
would not cooperate, the letter stated, the IRS had to go to federal
court in Norfolk, Va., to seek to enforce a summons for the records.
   Highlights of the report:
   _Ministry No. 1 was engaged in a lifestyle that led the IRS to
believe some income was not reported. Acting on an informant's tip,
the Criminal Investigation Division prepared a case that has been
referred to a federal grand jury.
   _No. 4: IRS agents are reviewing content of TV broadcasts to
determine whether they were primarily political.
   _No. 8: A team of auditors and a computer specialist are
investigating allegations of political activities, lobbying and
personal enrichment from ministry funds.
   _No. 11: As a result of a newspaper story, the IRS is auditing
the minister's individual tax return; the minister is not
cooperating.
   _No. 12: A computer picked this minister's return for audit on
grounds of unsubstantiated deductions. The case was closed with
payment of $3,000 tax and penalties.
   _No. 16: The IRS has completed review of the books and records
for this ministry for 1984 through 1986; the chief issue is whether
tax-deductible contributions to the ministry flowed to the benefit
of the founder and his family. Alleged political activities also are
being reviewed.
   _No. 20: The minister's personal tax return was audited; he was
alleged to have channeled church assets to personal use. The case
was closed when he reported additional taxable income.

   Academy Award nominee John Cleese will reprise
his role as a snobby British psychiatrist on the NBC hit comedy,
``Cheers,'' while in town for the Oscar presentations.
   The former Monty Python ``Minister of Funny Walks'' will film the
episode March 21, eight days before the Oscars. Cleese is nominated
for his screenplay for the movie ``A Fish Called Wanda.''
   In the ``Cheers'' program scheduled to be broadcast April 13, he
plays Dr. Simon Finch-Royce, a specialist in marital and family
counseling.
   Two seasons ago, his character recommended that Sam the
bartender, played by Ted Danson, and Diane, portrayed by Shelley
Long, should not go through with their then-pending marriage.
   Diane's former lover, Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer), recommended
his school chum and fellow psychiatrist to the couple and offered to
pay the fee.
   In the new episode, Crane still owes Finch-Royce $1,500 for the
counseling session. Meanwhile, Finch-Royce also is promoting his
book, ``Successful Marriage and Fidelity.''
   In real life, Cleese has written a book with psychiatrist Robin
Skynner ``Families _ How to Survive Them.''

<TEXT>
   The parents of comatose 31-year-old
woman asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to overturn a decision
by the state's highest court preventing them from removing their
daughter's feeding tube so she can die.
   In November, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that Joe and
Joyce Cruzan could not order the removal of the surgically-implanted
tube providing food and water for their daughter Nancy, a 1983
car-wreck victim.
   ``This will give Nancy another chance to have her wishes carried
out through her parents,'' attorney Bill Colby said in a telephone
interview from his Kansas City law office. He represents Ms. Cruzan
and her parents, who are their daughter's court-appointed guardians.
   Attorney General William Webster's office said it would file a
response to the Cruzans' appeal but did not think the Supreme Court
would find a constitutional issue in the case.
   ``The U.S. Supreme Court has never extended the right of privacy
to permit a patient or guardian to direct the withdrawal of food or
water, which are the basic necessities of life,'' Webster said in a
statement.
   Doctors say Ms. Cruzan of Carthage has been in a persistent
vegetative state since the accident and could live another 30 or 40
years with daily feedings through the tube implanted in her stomach.
   ``We know Nancy would not want the treatment she is receiving,''
Cruzan said in a statement from Colby's office. ``What right does
the state of Missouri have to tell us that ... her wishes and our
wishes do not matter at all?''
   The appeal argues that Ms. Cruzan's federal constitutional rights
to liberty, privacy and equal protection were ignored by the
Missouri Supreme Court when it refused to side with her parents,
Colby said.

<HEAD>Government Withholds Navaho Trust Funds; Cites Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs
notified Navajo officials Monday that the agency will not release
any tribal trust funds until there is a resolution of a power
struggle involving Chairman Peter MacDonald.
   James Stevens, Navajo Area director for the BIA, said his letter
to tribal officials does not involve such basic governmental
services as welfare and law enforcement and is expected to have
little immediate impact.
   Rather, Stevens said, he intended to ``put the tribe on notice''
and encourage the factions in tribal government to resolve the
dispute.
   The Tribal Council voted last month to place MacDonald on paid
administrative leave in the wake of corruption allegations aired
during U.S. Senate hearings. MacDonald has contested the legality of
that move and others by the council, insisting that he is still in
charge.
   Last week, MacDonald ordered two tribal officials fired and had
tribal police change the locks on the Navajo council and legislative
buildings.
   Tazbah McCullah, a spokeswoman for MacDonald, said officials in
the chairman's office Monday were studying Stevens' letter to
determine its impact on tribal operations.
   Stevens said the restriction applies to release of trust funds
from such sources as timber, coal and oil leases. He said the
Navajos periodically draw on the funds, mostly for tribal
administrative costs.
   He said the BIA acted because it is unable to determine who is in
charge of the tribe, the nation's largest.
   Stevens declined to say how much money was involved.

   As the first woman to describe the
liftoff of a spaceship with astronauts aboard, NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone gained a new perspective on journalists.
   ``I'm used to dealing with the media,'' she said. ``That's all I
do all day long. But it's not on me usually.''
   Monday morning, Malone, 27, had served as commentator for the
liftoff of the shuttle Discovery, sitting just a few seats from the
launch director in the firing room.
   Monday afternoon, Malone was back in her office at Kennedy Space
Center press headquarters, accepting congratulations from coworkers
and being questioned by reporters who considered her a story subject
rather than a story source.
   She said she was pleased with her performance, even though she
jumped the gun once.
   ``I said the ice team had already made their report to
management,'' Malone said. ``And I thought that they had. This was
one of those times when there was a lot going on. It was just a few
minutes later, then they came on and gave their report.''
   The countdown was longer than usual as fog and high winds delayed
the launch by nearly two hours. But Malone said her part went more
smoothly than she had expected ``because the launch team did such a
good job they made my job easier.''
   ``I think I did alright.''
   Malone expressed surprise that journalists were asking her about
her role as ``the first woman'' to do her job.
   ``I guess (it's) because they've always heard a male voice during
commentary,'' she said.
   ``There are so many woman newscasters. I don't really consider
this job that much different from what they're doing.''
   Malone first came to the Kennedy Space Center in 1982 as a
journalism student at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, where
she earned a bachelor's degree in 1984.
   To prepare for her debut, Malone provided launch commentary for
some unmanned Atlas Centaur and Delta launches and for the early
portions of some space shuttle countdowns and hired a voice coach.
   She is scheduled to serve as commentator again in August, when
Discovery makes its ninth mission.

   A new administrator for NASA will be
appointed within two weeks, according to James C. Fletcher, who has
held the job since 1986 and is eager to leave.
   Fletcher, who announced last year he wanted to retire when a new
administration took over the White House, said he was told by
President Bush's staff that a successor would be designated soon.
   ``I've been assured _ of course, I was assured it would be
February _ that in a week or two there would be somebody new,''
Fletcher said at an impromptu news conference Monday following the
launch of space shuttle Discovery.
   He said the failed White House effort to have former Sen. John
Tower confirmed as secretary of defense is one reason no new NASA
chief has been named.
   ``They got tied up with John Tower and a lot of other
appointments,'' he said.
   Fletcher said his wait to leave the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration has not been easy.
   ``I'm getting a little anxious about my situation,'' he said.
``I'm a lame duck, so to speak.''
   Fletcher has twice served as NASA administrator. He first held
the job in the 1970s, and then took it in the aftermath of the 1986
Challenger disaster.

   Congress' auditing agency today attacked the
government's 1988 spree of savings and loan sales as too costly and
said it would have been cheaper in a third of the deals reviewed to
shut down the institutions and pay off depositors.
   Charles A. Bowsher, comptroller general of the General Accounting
Office, said in testimony prepared for the Senate Banking Committee
that S&amp;L regulators required the purchasers to invest too little of
their own money.
   Officials at the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
guarantees S&amp;L deposits up to $100,000, also underestimated, by 20
percent to 40 percent, the value of tax breaks offered to buyers,
Bowsher said.
   The report comes as White House and Treasury Department officials
are reviewing a complex financing plan aimed at protecting regional
economies from the precipitous sale of billions of dollars of real
estate now in government hands as a result of S&amp;L failures.
   S&amp;L regulators already control about $7.5 billion in real estate.
According to Jerome Blank of the National Association of Realtors,
after all insolvent S&amp;Ls are cleaned up, regulators ``will become
the largest landowner in the United States and will have to dispose
of over $150 billion in real estate.''
   Discussing the 1988 S&amp;L sales, GAO sharpened the tone of previous
criticism as it presented its review of 12 of the biggest deals.
   For the year, regulators spent or made commitments to spend about
$37 billion to close, sell or prop up 222 ailing thrift
institutions. Of those, 179 were sold to new owners with government
subsidies totaling $28.4 billion.
   Regulators have said most of the rescues will be less costly in
the long run than liquidation and were the only option for the
cash-starved agency in the short run.
   However, Bowsher said that in four of the 12 rescue deals
examined, the government would have been better off simply to close
the institutions and pay off depositors.
   The tax breaks offered in last year's rescues totaled $7 billion
to $8 billion and, in nine of the deals examined, they will permit
the new owners to recoup their investment, on average, in only three
years, and in at least one instance in as little as a year, he said.
   The comptroller general also criticized the process for
attracting investors to failed S&amp;Ls, saying it ``was loosely
structured and administered inconsistently ... (and) may have
decreased the pool of prospective bidders.''
   Bowsher urged Congress to re-examine last year's deals and
exercise options under the contracts to reduce costs, including
paying off promissory notes issued by regulators and buying bad
loans and real estate from the institutions.
   Meanwhile, former Deputy Treasury Secretary R.T. McNamar
presented the real estate plan to Bush administration officials in a
private meeting late last week. According to an outline prepared by
McNamar and obtained by The Associated Press, it would create state
or local Real Estate Liquidation Trusts.
   The trusts would issue bonds, partly backed by the federal
government, partly by state or local governments, and use the money
to buy distressed S&amp;L real estate from the federal government.
   The trusts would be independent of local government and would
hire private sector staff who would manage the properties with the
goal of selling them at the highest price possible over 10 to 15
years. Trust managers' compensation would be based on long-term
performance of the properties under their care.
   The McNamar proposal could be warmly received by members of
Congress from energy-producing states such as Texas, where
already-weak real estate markets could be driven into a tailspin by
the quick sale of repossessed property.
   Other legislators, particularly in the House, may not welcome the
McNamar proposal. Members of the House Banking Committee over the
last year and a half have bitterly complained about the performance
and quasi-private structure of the Federal Asset Disposition
Association, an agency set up by S&amp;L regulators to manage
repossessed real estate and bad loans.
   FADA critics say real estate disposal is best handled by a
government agency less subject to industry influence and more
subject to congressional control. The McNamar outline would put the
real estate outside the direct control of the federal government.
   White House and Treasury Department officials on Monday did not
immediately return telephone calls seeking comment. McNamar, who
started a merchant banking firm in Los Angeles after leaving the
Reagan administration, said in a telephone conversation that he did
not wish to comment.
   ``These are just some preliminary ideas we've been working on.
They are very consistent with President Bush's program and may or
may not be useful,'' he said.

<HEAD>Yeutter Rejects Farmers Union call for Supports, Supply Management</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says
people who believe high price supports and supply management are the
answer to the nation's farm problems are behind the times.
   The National Farmers Union said at its convention last week in
Little Rock, Ark., that 1990 farm legislation ``must increase income
to farmers through higher (price support) loan rates and supply
management'' of the major crops.
   Yeutter, asked Monday in a telephone interview with farm
broadcasters about the NFU proposal, said he disagreed.
   ``We tried that in the '50s and '60s in this country and the
policy was an ignominious failure at that time,'' Yeutter said.
``There is no reason to expect it to be any less than an ignominious
failure this time around.''
   The United States, he said, is operating much more in the global
market than it did 20 years ago and is relying more heavily on
agricultural exports. This could not be done with higher price
supports, he said.
   Government loan rates essentially act as a floor on U.S. market
prices for such key commodities as wheat, corn and cotton. When
market prices decline to the loan or support level, farmers often
take out the government loans. If prices rise, they can pay off the
loans and sell their products for cash.
   Yeutter said he did not believe that when the U.S. price support
loans are raised other countries follow suit by boosting their
prices, thus keeping world markets on a fairly even keel.
   Even if that happened on the short-term, the higher prices would
be ``great incentive'' for other farmers around the world to expand
production and thereby create new surpluses and lower prices.
   Robert A. Denman, NFU director of international and public
affairs, said Yeutter's rejection of higher supports and production
controls raised a question about ``which policy has been the
ignominious failure'' in recent years.
   ``We kind of think the price-cutting policy over the last eight
years and the way government programs have been run should be viewed
as a greater ignominious failure,'' Denman said.
   The NFU position was supported in Little Rock by officials of the
National Farmers Organization and the American Agriculture Movement.
   Yeutter and U.S. trade representative Carla Hills were in
Brussels, Belgium, Friday and Saturday for talks with the European
Economic Community on farm subsidies and the current Uruguay Round
of negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The United States wants eventually to eliminate all
trade-distorting agricultural subsidies, while the EEC wants
short-term measures included in the negotiations.
   Yeutter reported ``some progress'' in the weekend discussions,
adding that those were confined to GATT matters and did not include
the touchy separate issue of European rejection of U.S. meat
containing growth hormones.
   ``They are delicate negotiations, and it's always dangerous to
comment very much in the middle of the game,'' Yeutter said.
   But he added that there had been a ``forward-looking discussion
of short-term measures'' and ``reasonably good'' talks on long-term
issues.
   ``We certainly have not resolved the differences between us on
either of those issues,'' he said.

   Private exporters have told the Agriculture
Department that the Soviet Union has bought an additional 515,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Monday the wheat was part of an
authorization on Jan. 25 of more than 2 million tons under the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Sims said the wheat is for shipment for April. Only 10,200 tons
are left in the current authorization.
   With the latest sale, the Soviet Union has bought about 4 million
tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a long-term supply
agreement, which was extended last fall to run through Dec. 31, 1990.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 515,000 tons are equal to about 18.9 million bushels
worth around $78 million at recent U.S. farm prices of $4.13 per
bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also
included about 10.2 million tons of corn, along with 450,000 tons of
soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of
grain sorghums.
   Sims said the 515,000 tons of wheat were sold by Ferruzzi USA
Inc., 100,000 tons; Cargill Inc., 100,000; Garnac Grain Company
Inc., 75,000; Louis Dreyfus Corp. 40,000; Alfred C. Toepher
International Inc., 50,000; Bunge Corp., 50,000; Gramplex Inc.,
50,000; Mitsubishi International, 25,000; and Continental Grain Co.,
25,000.
   The companies will get subsidies of $22.70 per ton, or about 62
cents per bushel, under the EEP arrangement.

   The National Cancer Institute has approved $1
million for a five-year study at Iowa State University, Ames, to see
if a cattle virus might hold some secrets that might be used in the
fight against AIDS.
   The project, reported Monday by the Agriculture Department, will
involve bovine immunodeficiency-like virus, or BIV, to see if it
damages the immune system in cattle. The virus, which was discovered
17 years ago by Martin J. Van Der Maaten at the department's
Virology Cattle Research Laboratory, Ames, was said to have ``some
structural similarities'' to the AIDS virus.
   Jack Gruber of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.,
said the cattle virus ``may provide a model useful for exploring the
complexities of the human AIDS virus and possibly may be useful for
developing AIDS prevention strategies.''

   Crew members on a military helicopter that
crashed and burned in the desert were wearing night-vision goggles,
but that was not a factor in the accident that killed 15 servicemen,
Air Force officials said Monday.
   Use of the light-amplifying goggles has been questioned in a
number of previous military crashes.
   Four Air Force Reserve crewmen and 11 Army Special Forces
soldiers from Fort Bragg, N.C., were aboard the CH-3E ``Jolly Green
Giant'' helicopter that went down Sunday night in the desert 25
miles northwest of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base here.
   Capt. Carlos Roque, a spokesman at Davis-Monthan, said he had no
information on the sequence of events leading to the crash and
didn't know if there had been any radio transmissions.
   Sgt. Jill Archer quoted Airman 1st Class John E. Klemack, a
spokesman for the 71st Special Operations Squadron at Davis-Monthan,
the crew's unit, as saying: ```We don't know what height they were
flying at when the crash occurred.''
   The Vietnam-era helicopter, assigned to Davis-Monthan, was
ferrying the soldiers from Fort Huachuca, 79 miles southeast of
Tucson, to an Air Force gunnery range at Gila Bend, 124 miles
northwest of Tucson.
   It went down in an uninhabited area adjacent to the Saguaro
National Monument about 20 miles northwest of Tucson, after stopping
at Davis-Monthan to refuel, Roque said.
   ``I looked up and I seen a yellow ball, like flames, coming out
of the back,'' said Mike Skrekas, who lives a few miles from the
crash site. ``Five seconds later I saw it hit the ground, and then
there was a red fireball.''
   A second helicopter was accompanying it but was a reasonable
distance away and was not involved in the crash, Roque said.
   More than 300 CH-3Es and similar helicopters belonging to the Air
Force, Navy and Coast Guard were grounded for a week that ended
Friday to inspect for a ``bad part'' in the main rotor head, Navy
Cmdr. David Thomas, a Pentagon spokesman, said early Tuesday.
   Air Force Lt. Col. Darrel Hayes said the helicopter that crashed
was inspected last Friday and had its main rotor head shaft nut
replaced. It was flown safely three times after that work.
   Officials at Davis-Monthan grounded the base's five remaining
CH-3Es until the cause of the crash is determined, the public
affairs office said.
   Roque said the flight crew was wearing night-vision goggles that
amplify low light but that investigators had determined that the
goggles ``were not a factor in the accident.''
   Roque said previous helicopter crashes in which pilots were
wearing such goggles ``were flying low-level or in close proxmity''
with other aircraft and that the goggles, ``when used in close
proximity or low level, may have caused a vision problem.''
   He said the flight from Tucson to Gila Bend was to be ``a
regular, straight, level flight.'' That is, ``it didn't involve any
capabilities other than flying in a straight line,'' as opposed to
low-level ``nap of the earth'' flying, following the contour of the
land, he explained.
   ``They were not doing that on this flight,'' said Roque, ``and as
a result when they were using the night-vision goggles they were in
open air space and not in proximity to anything.''
   Critics have questioned whether the goggles function adequately
when there is no moon or in cloudy weather that obscures stars. The
National Weather Service said there were high thin clouds over the
Tucson area Sunday night and that visibility was 30 miles. The crash
occured about an hour after sunset and about two hours before the
rise of a quarter-moon.
   The Orange County (Calif.) Register reported that since 1978, 37
of 41 Army helicopter crashes in which night goggles were used
occurred when there was not enough moonlight for the devices to
amplify. Those crashes killed 65 soldiers, the newspaper reported.
   The CH-3 series of helicopters was designed in the late 1950s and
early 1960s and is still flown by the Air Force, Navy and Coast
Guard. The Air Force began flying the choppers in 1962 and has 63
left in its inventory.
   Ms. Archer identified four of the victims as Lt. Colonel Lawrence
M. Rolle, 41, of Phoenix, the reserve squadron commander who was
flying as co-pilot; Maj. Donald D. Thomas, 42, of Tempe, the pilot;
Master Sgt. Malte Breitlow, 45, of Tucson; and Tech. Sgt. William E.
Slaven, 37, also of Tucson.
   Other names were not immediately released. Roque said the bodies
would have to be identified through medical and dental records.
   The soldiers were attached to the 3rd Battalion, 5th Special
Forces group at Fort Bragg, N.C., said Army Maj. Richard Adams.
Another spokesman at the fort said they had been at Fort Huachuca
since Wednesday and had been scheduled to leave April 9.

   America's Roman Catholic bishops deny they were
summoned to Rome to be chided for waywardness and say their four-day
meeting at The Vatican won't affect the document they are preparing
on women and the church.
   At a news conference Monday after their return, the bishops said
their meeting showed that Pope John Paul II is aware of the
particular problems the church faces in the United States.
   ``We have a heightened sense that Pope John Paul and the members
of the Curia understand our situation and support us in our work _
that they recognize that it is no easy job to be a bishop,
especially in America,'' Archbishop John May of St. Louis said.
   May, president of the U.S. Conference of Bishops, said,
``Clearly, there were some differences of perspective ... as might
be expected in any gathering of five dozen such people, but these
differences have to do with approach and not with doctrine.''
   Asked about reports that the bishops had been invited to Rome to
be chastised for taking too independent a course, Archbishop John
Quinn of San Francisco said: ``We never went to Rome with the
thought that we were to be chastised; we never said were going there
to be chastised; Rome never said we were going there to be chastised.
   ``That thought developed in areas completely apart from Rome or
the American bishops. I think we thought we were going there to sit
down as brothers and talk about the things that had surfaced during
the past several years.''
   May said the Vatican meeting would not result in any modification
of a document on women and the church which the U.S. Conference of
Bishops is preparing.
   ``There was no question about our document and its development,''
he said. ``We weren't advised and certainly never directed to modify
it.''
   Several questions touched on a statement by Cardinal Edouard
Gagnon, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, that in
allowing women to help decide annulment cases ``we have to be
careful that their tender hearts do not play tricks on them.''
   ``I would agree with the women of the United States in their
consternation and their irritation about certain things that were
said,'' May told reporters.
   He said that in replying to Cardinal Gagnon's statement during
the meeting, ``We said that we believed the women on our tribunals
had served in a most remarkably effective way and some of the best
officers of our tribunals were women.''

   Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou began
putting the political pieces together today after his government,
its credibility damaged by a financial scandal, defeated a censure
motion in Parliament.
   The vote just before midnight Monday was 155-123.
   It followed three days of raucous and often angry debate and
charges by Papandreou that the United States has tried to encourage
his political demise.
   The censure motion was filed by the conservative New Democracy
party, which claims Papandreou and senior Cabinet ministers received
millions of dollars in payoffs in a case involving a Greek banker
now in jail in Salem, Mass.
   Three deputies of the premier's governing Panhellenic Socialist
Movement abstained from the vote and Papandreou said they were
kicked out of the party as a result. The Socialists hold 157 of
Parliament's 300 seats.
   Had Papandreou failed to receive the 151 votes needed to defeat
the motion, his government would have had to resign with elections
held in 30 days.
   In the five months since the scandal first emerged, it has
triggered the resignations of seven Cabinet ministers.
   Prior to Monday's vote, Papandreou indirectly accused the CIA of
helping the jailed banker, 34-year-old George Koskotas, flee the
country.
   During the parliamentary debate, the premier also rejected
Washington's denial that Tom Malias, a self-proclaimed CIA agent,
ever worked for the U.S. intelligence agency.
   Malias told a parliamentary committee last week that Koskotas had
worked for the CIA in a plan to destabilize the Socialist government.
   On Sunday, the U.S. Embassy issued a statement saying neither
Malias ``nor the others he reportedly has alleged to work for the
CIA now work or ever have worked for the CIA.''
   ``The statement issued by the United States Embassy that Mr.
Mailis was not part of the CIA is unacceptable,'' Papandreou said.
   ``In whose interest was it to allow Koskotas to flee Greece? In
the United States he has the entire media available to him to attack
the government. So again I ask, in whose interest was it to make him
flee?'' he said.
   The premier reiterated a call for the immediate extradition of
Koskotas, who fled Greece in November after being indicted in a case
involving $200 million in fraud, forgery and embezzlement.
   The banker was arrested in the United States and is awaiting a
hearing on a Greek request for his extradition.
   He has alleged that Papandreou and some Cabinet members
authorized plans to siphon millions of dollars from the Bank of
Crete while Koskotas was chairman. He also claimed the politicians
received millions in payoffs.
   Most of the allegations were reported in the March 13 issue of
Time magazine.
   Papandreou has threatened ``painful'' consequences if Koskotas is
not extradited to Greece before June elections.
   On Saturday, he hinted at consequences for the United States by
referring to his government's decision to shut down one of four U.S.
military bases in Greece. He said talks on a new bases agreement
were continuing but that ``their time of stay in Greece is running
out daily.''
   New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis led the oppositon
attack against the government and called the premier's allegations
of CIA involvement ``a children's story.''
   He also repeated charges that the government was involved in
illegal arms sales to Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government and
to Iran and Iraq when they were at war.
   ``There are many large and bad smelling scandals,'' Mitsotakis
said.
   New Democracy submitted the censure motion by claiming the
banking scandal posed ``a danger for democracy and Greece.''
   The party, with 111 seats in Parliament, received support from
some independents and a small conservative faction to compile 123
votes for the motion. The Communists have 10 deputies and all
abstained.
   One independent voted with the government for the winning total
of 155.

<HEAD>Four Regional Banks Absorb Bulk of Bailout Money</HEAD>

   A total of $690 million has been spent by a new
federal board created to help bail out financially distressed banks
of the Farm Credit System, according to the board's first annual
report to Congress.
   The Farm Credit System Assistance Board's report said $629
million of that went to help regional banks in Jackson, Miss.;
Louisville, Ky.; Omaha, Neb.; and St. Paul, Minn.
   Eric P. Thor, president and the board's chief executive officer,
said the 1987 Farm Credit Act authorized the board ``to provide
financial assistance to eligible Farm Credit System lending
institutions and by so doing to help assure continuing credit
services to the nation's farmers and ranchers.''
   The law authorized up to $4 billion in aid to the beleaguered
system that was hit hard by declining land values, rising farm debt
and the inability of farm borrowers to pay their loan installments.
   From 1985 to 1987, the cooperatively owned Farm Credit System
alone had losses of more than $4.5 billion. Currently, the system
has about $55 billion in loans outstanding.
   The board is comprised of Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Will Erwin, an Indiana farmer.
   ``System institutions, including those receiving financial
assistance from the (board), are making progress toward financial
viability but are not yet there,'' the report said.
   Funds are raised at the request of the board by the sale of
15-year Treasury guaranteed bonds. Interest on the bonds is paid by
the Treasury for the first five years, half by Treasury and half by
the system for the second five years, and entirely by the system in
the final five years.
   The system's institutions pay the principal upon maturity, plus
all interest initially funded by the Treasury.
   About $370.6 million in the first year of operation went to the
four banks to help them recover. In return, they had to carry out
reforms to put the institutions on sound footing.
   The four banks and their aid packages included: Federal Land Bank
of Jackson, $37.6 million; Farm Credit Bank of Louisville, $90
million; Farm Credit Bank of Omaha, $110 million; and Farm Credit
Bank of St. Paul, $133 million.
   In addition, the board assumed more than $258.4 million in
previous debt owed by those four as IOUs to financially healthy
other banks in the system under an earlier bailout arrangement.
There was no breakdown for that amount.
   The balance of the $690 million in expenditures included: board
expenses, $2 million; retirement of frozen borrower stock, $21
million; interest on promissory notes payable, $563,000; discount of
first bond sale, $2.25 million; and prefunding, $35.2 million.

   Modern-day pilgrims who worry more
about flooded basements than fur trade with the Indians are upset
with the comeback the beaver population has made in Massachusetts.
   Wildlife biologists have stopped a beaver relocation program
because there is no corner of the state where the toothy rodents are
not entrenched.
   ``There's nowhere to put them,'' said Tom Decker, a biologist
with the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. ``You'd just be
moving your problem into somebody else's backyard.''
   The industrious animals, whose dams have resulted in flooded
basements, helped the state's first settlers survive, state
biologist James Cardoza said Monday. ``The beavers were the reason
they were able to sustain the colony because their sponsors wanted
to bargain with the Indians for furs,'' he said.
   By the Revolutionary War, however, beavers had disappeared from
Massachusetts and most of New England because of year-round trapping
and the drainage of wetlands for farming.
   After an absence of two centuries, two beaver colonies took hold
in Berkshire County in the 1920s.
   Among some of the biggest beaver headaches in Massachusetts in
recent years was a colony in the town of Montgomery that drew
spectators until the beavers set their sights in 1986 on a brook
flowing under Main Street.
   The animals built dams faster than work crews could demolish
them, threatening the main thoroughfare of the town of 500 people
and inspiring one resident to hang a sign bearing a score: ``Beavers
33, Waterworks 10, Highway Department 0.''

   Silt, a little town of about 1,200 people
along the Colorado River, is fighting off years of slurs and jokes
about its name with a new bumper sticker.
   ``Silt Happens.''
   The promotion is the brainchild of Silt resident Jim Bailey and
Steve Anderson, an advertising salesman for the Valley West Dispatch
in the nearby town of Parachute.
   Silt town administrator Jim Yale said the idea is ``to get
something to talk about and get something going in town.''
   Several years ago, the town board considered changing the name
because of the hard time the community gets about the name Silt.
   The new name of Pistol was proposed to capitalize on Rifle, a
larger community of about 5,000 people seven miles west of Silt.
   But a town councilor observed at the time that living in a town
called Silt ``is like being a boy named Sue _ it makes you tough.''

   On his first day as the nation's first director
of national drug control policy, William J. Bennett took aim at an
immediate and glaring problem: Washington D.C.
   The vast majority of the slayings that have made the District of
Columbia the nation's murder capital have been drug related. This
year, there already have been 107 homicides.
   ``There's not only a real significance, but a symbolic
significance to that,'' Bennett said Monday, just hours after being
sworn into office at the White House by Supreme Court Justice
Antonin Scalia. ``Fifteen minutes away from the seat of the world's
freest government, you've got this kind of thing going on.''
   Bennett told reporters that in the next few weeks, he may declare
Washington a ``high intensity drug trafficking area,'' which would
allow him to allocate federal personnel and cash to combat the
problem. He said he hadn't decided whether he would call for law
enforcement help from any specific agencies, such as the Drug
Enforcement Administration, the FBI or the military.
   ``This would be an interesting test case, a very hard test
case,'' Bennett said. ``We would be talking about moving the federal
bureaucracy, which has its own reputation, and the D.C. bureaucracy,
which is not without a reputation, moving two bureaucracies at
once.''
   However, he said, ``It's not a test case to see whether the
bureaucracy will respond. It's first and foremost a test to see
whether we can be helpful to a very distressing and ugly situation
that cries out for help.''
   The rapid movement on the issue came as a surprise, since Bennett
had declined during his confirmation hearings two weeks ago to give
senators specifics on what he planned to do. He asked them to wait
until he conducted a complete evaluation of the situation as well as
the dozens of government agencies involved in the drug war and
finished his national drug control strategy, a plan required within
180 days of taking office.
   But Bennett said Monday that it was appropriate for him to act on
Washington's problems before analyzing the whole government and its
budget.
   ``We may well learn, in the course of this, a lot of things that
will be useful for that six-month report,'' he said. ``One of the
things we'll be doing over the course of the six months is to look
at efforts being tried all over the country, including ours, to see
what kind of promise they hold.''
   He said one thing he already knows is that law enforcement alone
can't solve the problem.
   ``There are a hell of a lot of people out there who want to take
drugs and they'll go through a hell of a lot to do that,'' Bennett
said.
   Meanwhile, Walter Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's non-voting
delegate to Congress, said he will sponsor legislation allowing Bush
to give Washington $1.3 billion in federal disaster relief to
respond to the drug-related violence.
   And D.C. Mayor Marion Barry Jr. said Monday that he has decided
to create an Office of Drug Czar to help coordinate local efforts
against drugs and to serve as his administration's chief spokesman
on drug issues. The office will be a clearinghouse for drug
initiatives already undertaken by various city agencies.
   Federal officials questioned Fauntroy's plan to finance the
hiring of 700 police officers over five years, saying it would be a
major misuse of disaster aid.
   ``It's not within the parameters of the emergency assistance
program we have now,'' said Anne Voight, a Justice Department
spokeswoman. ``The district's problem would be considered chronic.''

<HEAD>Ten States Join Waste Protection Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten states have joined a federal pilot program
to control medical wastes, but critics say it gives too little
protection against syringes and other contaminated items washing
onto beaches again this summer.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday additional
record-keeping requirements for medical wastes will take effect by
this summer in states from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic. Other
states may also choose to join the program.
   The pilot program was directed by Congress last year after
numerous reports of medical wastes, including syringes and other
contaminated items, being found on beaches. Some were forced to
close.
   The program requires, under the threat of civil and criminal
penalty, detailed record keeping as a particular medical waste
travels from origination to final disposal. Along the way, the
transporter and others handling the waste must sign the documents.
In addition, the regulation requires waste fluids and sharp objects
such as syringes to be separated and imposes packaging and labeling
requirements.
   The record keeping covers a broad range of medical wastes such as
human blood and blood products, human pathological wastes from
surgery and autopsies, waste from patients who have been isolated
with communicable diseases, cultures and stocks of infectious
agents, and such items as scalpels, needles and syringes, according
to the EPA.
   EPA officials acknowledged that the program, even if all 10
states agree to participate, is expected to address only partially
the problem of medical wastes washing onto beaches.
   Many such items come from home use and illegal drug use and are
not covered by the additional tracking requirements, officials said.
The program covers wastes that originate with physicians, dentists,
veterinarians, small clinics, laboratories and hospitals.
   Nevertheless, said EPA Administrator William Reilly, the rules
``will substantially increase'' the amount of medical wastes that
are given close scrutiny during disposal.
   But a group of 19 congressmen criticized the EPA for excluding
some categories of medical wastes, including items such as surgical
gloves and bandages even if they have been used in treating patients
with AIDS or other contagious diseases.
   ``The EPA cannot make the medical waste problem disappear by
limiting the definition of the term `medical waste,''' said Rep. Jim
Florio, D-N.J., accusing the EPA of creating sweeping exemptions to
its tracking requirements.
   Senior EPA officials disputed claims that some medical wastes
were excluded even though they posed health problems. For example,
they suggested, a rubber glove or gown may not always be subject to
the special tracking because by the time it is in the waste cycle it
no longer poses a health threat.
   ``Simply (a waste product) coming into contact with an infectious
agent does not constitute a health risk,'' said Sylvia Lowrance,
director of the EPA's office dealing with solid wastes.
   She said that even some items that may have been in contact with
an AIDS victim or a patient with a highly communicable disease such
as hepatitis is not always considered a health threat ``given how
fragile these viruses are.''
   The new tracking procedures will be required under a two-year
program in the 10 states: Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and
Minnesota. Other states may choose to join the program, and the
seven states other than Connecticut, New York and New Jersey may
withdraw from the program within 30 days.
   Violators in the program are subject to civil penalties of up to
$25,000 a day for each violation and possible criminal prosecution
with a maximum $50,000 fine and a jail term of up to five years.

   Discovery's astronauts, safely in
orbit Monday after a weather-delayed launch, set free a $100 million
satellite to complete a globe-spanning network that will let future
spacefarers call Mission Control at almost any time.
   The 2{-ton Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, its double
parasol-like antennae folded, slipped clear of Discovery's cargo bay
at 4:10 p.m. EST and floated into space.
   ``We had a good deploy, on time,'' said Discovery mission
specialist Robert C. Springer.
   At a critical moment in the deployment, an unexplained electronic
signal momentarily jammed a computer used to deploy the satellite,
but then, just as mysteriously, the machine cleared up and appeared
normal.
   ``We didn't get any (more) of those spurious signals,'' Springer
said.
   Mission control confirmed that data on the ground showed that the
computer was functioning normally.
   An hour after the deployment, TDRS's powerful first-stage rocket
fired and sent the craft toward a new, higher orbit.
   Kathy Sullivan, an astronaut acting as Mission Control
communicator with Discovery, told the crew the rocket firing was so
accurate that a ``trim burn,'' used to correct errors, was not
required.
   ``Fantastic news,'' came the reply from Discovery. ``Thanks a
lot.''
   At 10:23 p.m. EST, a second-stage rocket fired, and within 30
minutes the satellite reached its work station 22,300 miles over the
Atlantic Ocean.
   ``It was a good burn of normal duration,'' Mission Control
announced.
   Putting TDRS in place was the major goal of the nation's 28th
space shuttle flight. The rest of the five-day mission will be
devoted to a group of science experiments, ranging from a study of
how bones heal in space to a test of a spacecraft radiator system.
   Deployment of the satellite came 6 hours, 12 minutes after
Discovery leaped from its seaside launch pad and raced out of view
across a clear Florida sky in a launch that marked a successful
beginning to NASA's plan to fly seven shuttles this year.
   Discovery, its rockets firing flawlessly, charged smoothly into
orbit with five astronauts, the communications satellite and a cargo
of experiments that includes four rats with clipped bones, and 32
chicken eggs.
   ``It's a great start to a long launch season,'' launch director
Bob Sieck told a news conference at the Kennedy Space Center.
   The 9:57 a.m. EST liftoff was an hour and 50 minutes later than
planned. Early-morning fog _ so dense it obscured the launch pad
from just a short distance away _ caused some delay, but the major
problem was winds five miles overhead. Officials feared powerful
shear forces could tear the spacecraft apart as it raced upward
faster than the speed of sound.
   To compensate for the winds, a computer aboard Discovery was
quickly reprogrammed to adjust the ship's flight angle. The stalled
countdown clock was restarted and then ticked without hesitation to
liftoff.
   Mission commander Michael L. Coats, a 43-year-old Navy captain,
leads a crew that includes Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, 46, the
mission pilot; Springer, 46, a Marine colonel; Dr. James. M. Bagian,
37, a physician, and Marine Col. James F. Buchli, 43.
   Once in place, TDRS will become the third and final link in a
communications constellation that is vital to NASA's future space
plans.
   By using the satellite network, the space agency will be able to
exchange radio messages with the shuttle and other satellites at
least 85 percent of the time they are in orbit. A small sliver over
the Indian Ocean is the only part of the shuttle orbit blocked from
contact.
   Before TDRS, NASA depended on ground stations, outposts with huge
dish antennae sprinkled at points around the globe. Shuttle
astronauts could speak to Mission Control only as they overflew the
ground stations, a link that covered only about 15 percent of each
mission. NASA will soon close six ground stations at a savings of $3
million a month.
   Establishing the TDRS network has been a struggle for NASA.
   TDRS-1 was placed into orbit in 1983, but a rocket stage failed
and the agency was forced to use small attitude control jets to
maneuver the satellite into place, a process that took many weeks
and burned most of the precious control fuel.
   The second TDRS was destroyed, along with seven astronauts, in
the explosion of space shuttle Challenger in 1986.
   NASA considered the communications network so important that the
main goal of the first mission following Challenger last September
was to put a new TDRS in place. The satellite was launched smoothly
and now hangs high over the Pacific Ocean.
   TDRS-1, now ailing and old, will become a spare once the third
satellite delivered by Discovery is in place.
   Sharing the shuttle cabin with Coats and his crew are four rats,
32 fertilized chicken eggs and a small garden of plants.
   The rats are part of an experiment to test how injured bones
would heal in the weightlessness of orbit. Before they were loaded
into cages on Discovery, small chips of bones were clipped from each
of the rodents. When the rats are returned to Earth, the healing of
their bones will be compared the healing experienced by similar rats
on the ground.
   The eggs are developing embryos at the same time as a group of
eggs left on Earth. The growth rate of the two groups of eggs will
be compared after the mission.
   A similar comparative study is being conducted with two types of
plants being grown aboard Discovery.

<HEAD>City Officials Give Bush, Congress $14 Billion Shopping List</HEAD>

   Municipal officials are pointing with
frustration to the proposed savings and loan bailout as they ask
Congress and the Bush administration to consider tax increases to
pay for urban aid.
   Members of the National League of Cities, the organization of
municipal leaders from cities of all sizes, were lobbying Congress
today armed with a list of suggestions for tax increases.
   At the same time they were voicing anger over proposed rescue
plans for the beleaguered S&amp;L industry, where estimates for the cure
range as high as $150 billion over years.
   ``The plan for helping banks with bad loans that they have
already written off and never should have made is moving ahead,
while funding for the war on drugs is a billion dollars short,''
said Mayor Terry Goddard of Phoenix, Ariz.
   ``Tell the Congress we can see through the scam,'' Goddard said.
``The deficit can no longer be used as an excuse to avoid setting
legitimate spending priorities.''
   The nearly 3,000 members conclude their annual winter meeting
today by spreading across Capitol Hill to meet with their
congressional delegations.
   The league's board of directors, meeting over the weekend, came
up with the list of 16 federal tax increases its members would
accept ``if our priorities are funded'' for urban needs.
   Goddard said the municipal leaders identified $14 billion in
requests for additional federal spending that they want from
Congress and the Bush administration.
   They include urban enterprise zones, which use tax incentives to
attract businesses to ghettos; full funding of the emergency
homeless legislation; a new housing initiative; full funding for
anti-drug legislation; and $7 billion for the Head Start program
providing early education for disadvantaged children.
   On the tax list were higher federal income taxes, an oil import
fee and broad-based energy taxes, greater taxation of Social
Security, and limiting the interest deduction for home mortgages.
   Not on the list was a gasoline tax, which some city officials say
should remain dedicated to transportation needs.
   ``In the past, we have been accused of coming to Capitol Hill
with a tin cup seeking a handout,'' said Goddard, president of the
league. ``It was painful, but this time we come with a balanced
program.''
   The League of Cities has backed higher federal taxes previously,
but the list of taxes was the organization's first attempt to
propose specific revenue alternatives to go along with their request
for restoration of some federal urban aid.
   Mayor Richard Berkley of Kansas City, Mo., a Republican and
former president of the league, said there was some sentiment for
higher federal taxes to cover urban needs among Republican municipal
office holders.
   ``I think ... there's generally a high degree of similiarity in
what the priorities of the Democratic and Republican mayors are _
maybe some differences in degree,'' Berkley said.
   ``In the whole scheme of things, we're not talking about huge
amounts of money,'' he said.
   The list was drafted because of congressional leaders' statements
that any new intitatives should be accompanied by proposals for
where the money will come from.
   Goddard said that President Bush's budget proposal for fiscal
1990, while including modest increases in Head Start, anti-drug and
homeless programs, would also impose major cuts on some of the
group's favorite programs and eliminate 82 domestic grant programs.

   The dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen
after a marginal retreat Tuesday, while share prices rose on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 129.92 yen, up 0.35 yen from Monday's
129.57-point finish. The currency opened at 130.23 yen and
fluctuated between 129.90 yen and 130.40 yen during the day's
dealings.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
148.82 points the previous day, regained 171.39 points, or 0.54
percent, to finish trading at 31,724.35.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's high opening in Tokyo to
indications by Karl Otto Poehl, president of the West German central
bank, that the bank has no intention of raising its interest rates.
   Speaking after a bankers meeting, Poehl said he thinks West
German interest rates are sufficient to contain inflation.
   The dollar moved higher in New York overnight on the strength of
Poehl's comments, said Tokyo dealers, adding that the upward
movement caused the dollar to also rise in Tokyo.
   Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama suggested at a press
conference Tuesday that the dollar's recent strength was not of
serious concern and indirectly discouraged the possibility of
intervention by the Bank of Japan.
   A central bank dealer said the market was in a wait-and-see mood
because of concerns over U.S. trade figures to be released Wednesday
in Washington.
   In stock trading, the Nikkei strengthened as individual investors
bought shares, traders said.
   Participants were interested in cheap, small issues, added one
trader with a major securities firm in Tokyo, speaking on condition
of anonymity. But trading was inactive ahead of the U.S. trade
report, he said.

<TEXT>
   The departure of Rep. Dick Cheney as the No. 2
person in the House Republican leadership is causing an ideological
and generational struggle for succession in a minority that has been
losing its top people.
   Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill., a moderate counted among the party's
pragmatists, on Monday formally entered the contest to replace
Cheney as House minority whip, challenging conservative Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., who had announced Friday he would seek the post.
   Cheney was beginning the confirmation process today in his
nomination to become President Bush's secretary of defense. An
election for his successor as whip will likely come after Congress
returns from its Easter recess next month.
   A third lawmaker seen as a strong possibility to make the race _
Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, chairman of the House Republican
Conference _ spent Monday telephoning colleagues and had not yet
decided whether to run for the position, said a spokesman.
Ideologically, Lewis is seen as somewhere between Madigan and
Gingrich.
   The matchup brought to the surface a long-simmering identity
crisis for the Republicans, who have been in the minority in the
House for better than three decades.
   Madigan represents the old guard, those who have carved out a
role for Republicans through cooperation with the majority Democrats
and by choosing their political fights carefully.
   In a letter sent to his GOP colleagues on Monday, Madigan said he
would ``maximize cooperation'' with Minority Leader Robert Michel,
R-Ill., and help President Bush press his legislative agenda.
   Gingrich, leader of a band of several dozen arch-conservatives,
advocates confrontation over conciliation. He has been the chief
accuser of House Speaker Jim Wright over alleged ethics violations,
and vociferously condemns what he terms the Democrats' ``welfare
state'' while advocating a ``conservative opportunity society.''
   An aide said Gingrich, after a weekend of calling colleagues, had
secured the support of more than 40 of the 175 House Republicans.
   One lawmaker, Rep. Thomas Petri, R-Wis., predicted the situation
could become ``a real brouhaha,'' with the potential for a bruising,
high-level game of musical chairs within the leadership.
   The departure of Cheney, who as minority whip was the party's
chief House vote-counter and Michel's heir apparent, leaves a vacuum
in the GOP's top ranks in the House and was seen as a setback for
Republican efforts to regain majority status.
   ``Dick Cheney was a major figure in the House Republican Party,''
said Thomas Mann, a longtime Congress-watcher at the Brookings
Institution. ``He is a man who was able to keep the divisions
between the older, somewhat more traditional Republicans and the
younger guerrilla warriors from erupting into open warfare. ... It's
a serious loss for House Republicans.''
   The loss of Cheney so soon after the departure of Rep. Trent
Lott, R-Miss., the former whip who won election to the Senate last
year, and Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., now secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, underscores what some see as the hopelessness of being
a House Republican.
   ``It points to the difficulty they have in retaining their most
talented members when other opportunities present themselves,'' Mann
said.
   An official of the conservative Heritage Foundation, senior vice
president Burt Pines, said conservatives would welcome Gingrich's
participation because they believe a more activist approach is
needed to regain the majority.
   ``A confrontation is building between those in the House who want
to build a Republican majority and those who would become accustomed
to coasting,'' Pines said. ``This is going to strengthen that
movement and maybe frighten Michel out sooner. Michel has just
learned to love the minority... They're happy to get some crumbs''
from the Democrats.
   Lewis was seen as the favorite to succeed Cheney should he decide
to seek the No. 2 post. But such a move would open up the conference
chairman's job and trigger a secondary scramble to fill that post,
possibly involving others in the leadership hierarchy such as Rep.
Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., who now is chairman of the GOP Policy
Committee. The Republican Research Committee chairman, Rep. Duncan
Hunter, R-Calif., might then be tempted to move up in the pecking
order, as well.
   Michel was said by GOP officials to want to avoid a nasty fight
within the party. Most in the current crop of leaders have been in
their posts only two months, and a full-scale shakeup could only
delay organizing efforts.

<TEXT>
   A one week grounding of more than 300
military helicopters led to the replacement of a main rotor shaft
nut on a CH-3E just two days before it crashed, killing 15
servicemen, officials said today.
   Officials at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base imposed a new grounding
on its five remaining CH-3E helicopters Monday after ruling out the
use of controversial night-vision goggles as the cause of the crash.
   Authorities, meanwhile, recovered the last of the bodies of four
Air Force Reserve crewmen and 11 Army Special Forces members from
Fort Bragg, N.C., from the charred wreckage of the CH-3E ``Jolly
Green Giant.''
   The Vietnam-era helicopter went down in flames Sunday night 25
miles northwest of Davis-Monthan, base spokesman Capt. Carlos Roque
said. Flags flew at half-staff at the base and a temporary morgue
was set up ahead of an Air Force forensic team's arrival to complete
identifications of the bodies.
   ``It's like losing a family member,'' said Capt. Ginny Garvin, a
squadron officer.
   Investigators were trying to determine how high the helicopter
was flying and whether it made radio contact with an accompanying
helicopter or with air traffic controllers at Davis-Monthan before
it crashed, Roque said.
   Navy Cmdr. David Thomas, a Pentagon spokesman, said early today
that more than 300 CH-3Es and similar helicopters belonging to the
Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard were grounded for a week that ended
Friday to inspect a nut attaching the main rotor head to the
helicopter frame. He said he didn't know what would happen if the
nut came off in flight.
   Air Force Lt. Col. Darrel Hayes said the helicopter that crashed
was inspected Friday and its nut was replaced. It was flown safely
three times after that work.
   Neither Thomas nor Davis-Monthan officials knew whether the new
grounding of CH-3Es at the base would apply to similar helicopters
in service elsewhere.
   The crash occurred after the helicopter refueled at Davis-Monthan
while ferrying the soldiers from Fort Huachuca, 80 miles southeast
of Tucson, to a gunnery range near Gila Bend, 125 miles northwest of
Tucson.
   The flight crew was wearing night-vision goggles that amplify low
light, but investigators determined the goggles were not a factor in
the accident, Roque said.
   Previous helicopter crashes in which night-vision goggles have
been suspected of being the cause were flying low-level or in close
proxmity with other aircraft, he said.
   But Sunday's flight was to have been a regular, straight, level
flight, he said. The accompanying helicopter was a reasonable
distance away and wasn't involved in the crash, he added.
   Critics have questioned whether the goggles function adequately
when there is no moon or in cloudy weather that obscures stars. The
National Weather Service said there were high thin clouds over the
area Sunday night, with 30-mile visibility. The crash occurred about
an hour after sunset and about two hours before the rise of a
quarter-moon.
   The Orange County (Calif.) Register reported Sunday that since
1978, 37 of 41 Army helicopter crashes in which night goggles were
used occurred when there was not enough moonlight for the devices to
amplify. Those crashes killed 65 soldiers, the newspaper reported.
   The CH-3 series was designed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
The Air Force has 63 left in its inventory.
   Four of the victims were identified as Lt. Col. Lawrence M.
Rolle, 41, of Phoenix, commander of the reserve squadron and
co-pilot of the helicopter; Maj. Donald D. Thomas, 42, of Tempe, the
pilot; Master Sgt. Malte Breitlow, 45, and Tech. Sgt. William E.
Slaven, 37, both of Tucson.
   The names of the other victims were not released.
   The soldiers were attached to the 3rd Battalion, 5th Special
Forces group at Fort Bragg, N.C., said Army Maj. Richard Adams.
Another spokesman at Fort Bragg said the soldiers had been at Fort
Huachuca since Wednesday and had been scheduled to leave April 9.

<HEAD>US to Seek More Aid for Contras</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is preparing to ask
Congress for more humanitarian aid for the Nicaraguan Contras at a
time when the rebels also are enjoying greater diplomatic acceptance
in the region than they had previously.
   Although no final decision has been made, U.S. officials said
Monday they expect the request probably will exceed $50 million.
Contra leader Adolfo Calero said after a meeting with State
Department officials the request will be ``40 some odd million
dollars.''
   The current $27 million humanitarian aid package expires at the
end of March and the administration request is likely to be sent to
Capitol Hill before the lawmakers open a two-week spring recess this
weekend, the officials said. Congress suspended military aid to the
rebels more than a year ago.
   More than 10,000 Contra fighters are clustered at camps in
Honduras along the Nicaraguan border. The administration wants to
see the rebels survive as a unified force at least until there are
assurances that the leftist Sandinista government will carry out
their promises to hold a fair national election early next year.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that the United
States formally made such a request Monday, asking Honduras to let
the guerrillas stay for another year.
   The Sandinistas, meanwhile, have maintained all along their
interest in creating a pluralistic system but that this process was
systematically thwarted by the Reagan administration's funding of
the Contras.
   There also is evidence of a softening in the Honduran attitude
toward the presence of the rebels on Honduran territory.
   After years of refusing to hold official talks publicly with the
rebels and even to acknowledge the existence of rebel camps on
national territory, Honduras broke the diplomatic ice Monday when a
delegation of Honduran officials, led by Ambassador Jorge Ramon
Hernandez Alcerro, met with Calero and other rebel leaders at a
Washington hotel.
   Hernandez spoke in unusually conciliatory terms about the
Contras, declining to repeat previous Honduran demands that the
rebels be expelled from Honduran territory.
   Asked whether the Contras should be forced out of Honduras before
the 1990 elections in Nicaragua, Hernandez said the answer depends
on negotiations that are to be carried out in Costa Rica at the end
of March by the five Central American foreign ministers.
   ``I really want you to understand that we have to proceed very
cautiously on this,'' he said. ``We don't want to take any positions
at the present moment that could impede us from achieving a
consensus among the Central American countries.''
   The policy of the five Central American countries is based
largely on a joint resolution approved by their respective
presidents last month in El Salvador. It calls for a plan to be
drawn up by this spring for the demobilization of the rebels in
exchange for Sandinista promises of democratic reform.
   Calero said there were no demands by the Hondurans during the
meeting for the evacuation of the rebels and added he was struck by
how friendly the Hondurans were. For his part, Hernandez called the
meeting ``positive.''
   Calero said the rebel cause also received a boost on March 4 when
he and other Contra leaders met with President Carlos Andres Perez.

   ``You know, if you have a sense of perspective at all, which is a

<HEAD>Scowcroft Removes Himself from Decisions Affecting 70 Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft has
removed himself from decisions affecting 70 companies, including a
major defense contractor, because of stock he owns worth at least $1
million and up to $3.3 million.
   But at the same time, Scowcroft has notified the White House
legal counsel's office that he will seek waivers allowing him to
take part in government dealings with some of the companies on the
list in which his interest is insubstantial.
   Financial disclosure reports released Monday by the White House
also showed that chief of staff John Sununu had assets and income
together last year of between $530,000 and $1.1 million. This
included his interest in a ski condominium, a residential lot next
to his New Hampshire home and a stake in an insurance agency.
   The document also said Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor,
has decided to give up tuition benefits from Tufts University for
his children. Sununu has been on leave from the school since 1982,
and last year received $5,500 in assistance.
   The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 requires senior government
officials to reveal their assets, liabilities and sources of income.
It does not require them to list exact amounts but rather to report
values within a range of money, such as $15,000 to $50,000 and
$100,000 to $250,000.
   Scowcroft's form revealed that the retired Air Force general was
unable to specify for whom he provided services as a hired
consultant for Kissinger Associates.
   In a letter about his financial reporting form, Scowcroft told
White House counsel C. Boyden Gray that former Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger, who heads Kissinger Associates, ``denied my
request for a list of the clients for whom I worked.'' Scowcroft
reported receiving $293,300 for his services to Kissinger.
   Scowcroft said that ``under my contractual relationship with
Kissinger Associates, I worked for the company, not directly for its
clients.''
   Scowcroft has at least temporarily removed himself from decisions
involving dozens of companies, including Lockheed Corp., a major
defense contractor, along with IBM, the RAND Corp., and Aerospace
Corp.
   Scowcroft received over $16,000 in consulting fees from Lockheed,
for example. And he got $50,000 to perform as a consultant to the
National Council for Peace and Security.
   The disclosure form showed Scowcroft has extensive bank and stock
holdings. Because officials are required under the law only to list
the valuations of assets in monetary ranges, the form indicated that
Scowcroft's holdings in 1988 were worth between $1,079,000 and
$3,265,000.
   Scowcroft reported liabilities ranging from $200,002 to $500,000.
   Because a part of his income came from interest and dividends,
which also needed only to be listed in value ranges, Scowcroft's
report showed he earned between $527,894 and $649,994.
   The disclosure form also showed that Scowcroft, formally national
security adviser to President Gerald R. Ford and later a member of
the presidential commission that investigated the Iran-Contra
affair, earned $53,751 in speaking honoraria.
   Scowcroft, whose national security post pays about $89,000 a
year, also received $49,452 last year for his membership on various
corporate boards.
   Sununu's holdings are largely in real estate.
   He owns a condominium in Cambridge, Vt., and a residential lot
adjacent to his home in Salem, N.H., and each is valued at $100,000
to $250,000. He earned from $15,000 to $50,000 in condominium rental
fees last year.
   Other major assets include a 40 percent ownership, valued at
between $100,000 and $250,000 in Lakeside Insurance Agency Inc. It
is listed under the name of his wife, Nancy.
   Other White House disclosure forms showed:
   _Charles ``Chase'' G. Untermeyer, White House personnel director,
listed assets including investments, partnerships and oil and gas
holdings totaling between $155,000 and $420,000.
   _Andrew Card, deputy chief of staff, listed a two-family
apartment in Holbrook, Mass., as his major asset, checking the
category between $100,000 and $250,000. He said he earned between
$5,000 and $15,000 in rental income from the apartment last year.
   _Robert M. Gates, deputy national security adviser, showed few
assets _ a savings account worth between $1,000 and $5,000 and two
Individual Retirement Accounts worth from $15,000 to $50,000 apiece,
one for himself and one for his wife.
   _David Q. Bates, secretary to the Cabinet, listed assets of
$29,000 to $100,000.
   _Frederick McClure, assistant to the president for legislative
affairs, listed $30,000 to $100,000 in assets and reported that he
was paid a salary of $132,770 in 1988 as an executive with Texas Air
Corp.
   _Jane E. Newman, assistant to the president for operations,
reported salaries from 1988 of $105,000 from the New England
Council, a non-profit regional business association of which she was
president, and $47,359 from the Business and Industry Association of
New Hampshire, a trade group that she headed.

   Eight barbers fought with scissors and
broken beer bottles in a drunken brawl over whether exiled President
Ferdinand Marcos should be allowed to return home, police said today.
   One barber was killed, and another was seriously wounded, they
reported.
   Police investigator Alfredo Amores said the fight took place
early Sunday, hours after the eight barbers left their shop and went
to a nearby restaurant in Manila's Malate tourist district.
   The barbers had begun arguing over Marcos' return even before
closing shop and resumed the argument over bottles of beer in the
restaurant, Amores said.
   The former president was ousted in a February 1986
civilian-military uprising that catapulted Corazon Aquino to the
presidency.
   Marcos fled to Hawaii, and Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow the
ailing Marcos to return, citing security reasons.
   Amores said tempers flared during the argument, and finally the
barbers pulled out their scissors and started stabbing each other.
   One of the barbers died of multiple stab wounds on the spot, and
another was critically wounded, Amores said.
   One was arrested and jailed, but the five others had escaped when
police arrived, Amores said. There was no word on charges.

<HEAD>Military Maneuvers Begin in Korea Amid Heightened Tension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today accused communist
North Korea of preparing for war and stirring up anti-Americanism as
U.S. forces began joint maneuvers with South Korean troops.
   About 200,000 South Korean and U.S. troops, along with naval and
air units, began 10 days of major annual military exercises.
   A Defense Ministry statement rejected North Korean charges that
the ``Team Spirit'' exercises were preparations for a nuclear attack
on the North. The exercises have been held every spring since 1976.
   ``The North should immediately stop its continuous military
buildup and war preparations and clearly show that it is giving up
its strategy of communizing the South by force,'' the statement said.
   North Korea put its armed forces on combat alert and mobilized
reserves in response to the exercises. The North said Monday that
the exercises could trigger war.
   ``The tension between the north and the south has been screwed up
to the highest pitch, and a dangerous situation has been created on
the Korean peninsula in which a war may break out any moment,'' said
Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency.
   The Korean peninsula was divided at the end of World War II when
U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's colonial rule over the region.
   The two Koreas became bitter enemies and fought a war from
1950-1953. The two sides are still technically at war because no
truce was ever signed.
   South Korean officials said in today's statement that the North
is trying to foment anti-American sentiment among South Koreans to
try to force removal of the 42,000 U.S. troops based in the South
under a mutual defense treaty.
   ``We are compelled to point out ... the north's scheme to
heighten anti-Americanism and get American troops out and ...
eventually realize revolution to communize the south,'' the ministry
statement said.
   Radical students, other dissidents, farmers and other groups in
the south are increasingly anti-American because of U.S. trade
pressure and perceptions that Washington has supported authoritarian
regimes.
   A U.S. military spokesman in Seoul said this year's ``Team
Spirit'' maneuvers involve about 70,000 U.S. troops, including the
42,000 stationed in South Korea and others from Hawaii, Okinawa, and
the U.S. mainland.
   North Korea routinely charges the exercises are preparations for
an attack on the north and puts its armed forces on alert.
   The north said earlier this year that talks with South Korea on
easing tension could not progress unless the exercises were called
off. Seoul refused to do so, and the peace talks have stalled.
   South Korean defense officials said again today that the
exercises are defensive and pose no threat to the north. They
criticized North Korea for rejecting the south's invitation to send
military observers to the exercises.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Would-be medical students will be taking a new
kind of admissions test in 1991 that will require them to write
essays as a measure of writing and thinking skills.
   The Association of American Medical Colleges said Monday the new,
streamlined test will be the first professional school admission
test to use essays and score them to evaluate applicants' ability to
write.
   The changes are meant to encourage students to pursue broad
undergraduate studies in natural sciences, social sciences and the
humanities.
   ``The new test signals the importance of critical thinking,
logical reasoning, problem-solving and communication skills to
medical education and medical practice,'' Dr. Robert Petersdorf, the
association's president, said in a statement.
   The current test consists of six sections on biology, chemistry,
physics, science problems, reading skills analysis and quantitative
skills analysis.
   The new one will consist of four tests: biological sciences,
physical sciences, verbal reasoning and a writing sample.
   At least 80 minutes should be shaved from the average current
test day of 9.5 hours, the association said.

<HEAD>Adult Bookstores Near FBI Building Shut Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company that operates adult bookstores across
the street from FBI headquarters has pleaded guilty to federal
racketeering charges, ending a two-year investigation, the Justice
Department said.
   FBI agents entered the stores and found videotapes with titles
such as ``Traci's Big Trick,'' ``His to Command,'' and ``Bound and
Punished,'' according to court documents.
   The plea agreement was outlined in U.S. District Court on Monday.
   The agreement provides that the two stores directly across the
street from the J. Edgar Hoover building will be closed immediately,
while two others located just down the street will be shut down
later.
   The case is the first obscenity prosecution in the federal court
in the district in 26 years and is only the second time the federal
racketeering law was used in an obscenity case since Congress placed
obscenity violations under that law in 1984, according to Assistant
Attorney General S.G. Dennis Jr.
   Automatic Enterprises Inc., the owner of the bookstores, was
fined $150,000 as part of the settlement.

<NOTE>$10 Million in Drug Paraphernalia Seized</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Customs Commissioner William von Raab
stood behind a sparkling array of bongs, pipes and scales as he
announced seizures of up to $10 million in drug paraphernalia.
   ``We're going to take away from the drug abuser the tools of his
trade,'' von Raab said Monday. Those who manufacture and distribute
such products ``are putting yourself at risk to lose millions of
dollars of your inventory,'' he said.
   The 306,000 items seized March 1 from the Contempo Products Inc.
warehouse in Nashville filled eight 48-foot containers and was the
largest such seizure in U.S. history, he said. On March 4, Customs
officials seized enough items from the Award Distributing Co. in
Philadelphia to fill four such containers, the second largest
seizure in history, he said.
   But von Raab acknowledged that the amount confiscated would
``probably not have a measurable impact'' on the drug paraphernalia
industry. He estimated that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
drug paraphernalia is sold annually.
   So far, there have been no arrests in any of the recent cases,
but he said U.S. attorneys around the country ``are identifying
people who might be indicted.''

<NOTE>Private Eye Misrepresented Himself, Panel Told</NOTE>

   A private investigator hired by Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. misrepresented himself as working for a House
subcommittee while Drexel was assisting in a corporate takeover, the
subcommittee was told.
   The allegation before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's
oversight and investigations subcommittee was made by William G.
Bertain, a Eureka, Calif., lawyer involved in a pending suit over
the 1985 Drexel-assisted takeover of Pacific Lumber Co. by Maxxam
Corp. of Houston.
   Bertain told the subcommittee that John Gibbons, a former
assistant U.S. attorney in California and now a private investigator
for Kroll Associates, had told him on five occasions last year that
he was seeking information about Maxxam's chairman, Charles Hurwitz,
on behalf of a congressional subcommittee.
   In one of the conversations, which was taped by Bertain, Gibbons
said he was working for the oversight and investigations panel,
which is chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., Bertain testified.
   But Gibbons' boss, John Kroll, the principal owner of the
detective agency, told reporters it is ``totally inconceivable''
that Gibbons had misrepresented himself and predicted that he would
be vindicated when the hearing continues next week.
   Drexel agreed in principle in December to plead guilty to six
charges of securities law violations and pay a record $650 million
fine. The Securities and Exchange Commission also has alleged that
Drexel violated securities laws in Maxxam's takeover of Pacific
Lumber, the largest private holder of redwood timberland in
California.

   Under a new government requirement, the Rising Sun
will ripple over all Japan's schoolyards next year and the country's
once-shunned national anthem echo through school auditoriums.
   A Japanese warlord, likewise, will be ending his long exile from
the history books.
   The Education Ministry says the curriculum changes will help
youngsters understand what it means to be Japanese.
   But some Japanese object, saying they consider the flag and
anthem symbols of the country's militaristic past. They say the
changes merely revive the trappings of imperialism, not the truth
behind it.
   The debate over the new curriculum represents yet another chapter
in Japan's struggle to deal with its past, a struggle heightened by
the death of Emperor Hirohito, whose 62-year reign encompassed both
war and resurgence.
   The curriculum, to be phased in from 1990 to 1994, requires
teachers to hoist the Rising Sun flag and have students sing the
anthem at such events as graduation ceremonies.
   Neither the flag nor the anthem ``Kimigayo'' has any legal
standing.
   The Rising Sun is flown in public less than the Stars and Stripes
is in the United States, and many schools do not follow the current
guideline that only suggests the anthem be sung and a flag-raising
ceremony be held.
   The anthem was formerly considered a prayer for the emperor's
long life. Now the ministry says the song seeks ``the Japanese
people's prosperity centered around the emperor.''
   ``It is important to nurture (a child's) identity as a
Japanese,'' says Education Minister Takeo Nishioka. ``Unless
children have understanding and respect for their national flag and
national anthem, they will not even have the manners to pay respect
to the flag and anthem of other countries.''
   Masami Yamazumi, an education professor at Toritsu University,
complained that a school's mission should be to teach meaning and
historical background and not to force students to salute the flag
and sing the anthem.
   Schools have not taught such things or the negative side of the
emperor _ his wartime role, for example, he said.
   ``Truth must be taught to prevent history from repeating itself.
It's regrettable that many schools ignore Japanese modern history,
though that's the most important part,'' Yamazumi added.
   Japan's failure to specify its wartime aggression in history
textbooks has angered other Asian nations, and their protests have
forced the Education Ministry to revise the texts.
   Takahiro Miura of the liberal Japan Teachers' Union said the new
curriculum is imperialistic because it fails to admit aggression,
and the union will urge the ministry to delete the controversial
elements.
   About 30 groups throughout the nation also have submitted
petitions with more than 20,000 signatures objecting to the flag and
song.
   The liberal Tokyo Teachers Association said only 670 of 1,700
Tokyo schools set up mourning flags for the six days suggested by
the government after Hirohito's death on Jan. 7.
   The association's Ikuya Nishikawa admitted, however, that even
liberal teachers have seldom discussed the emperor in class, partly
because of concern over possible attacks from pro-emperor rightists.
   The Education Ministry's curriculum also is adding a
controversial military hero _ Admiral Heihachiro Togo, whose ships
sank the Russian fleet in 1905 _ to a list of notable figures to be
studied in sixth-grade history classes.
   Togo, known for unquestioning loyalty to emperor and country,
became a non-person in postwar education because of his militaristic
connotations.
   Nishioka says Japan's strength and international position were
heightened by victories in the 1894-95 Sino-Japanese War and the
1904-05 Russo-Japanese War.
   ``What would have happened to Japan if it had lost the
Russo-Japanese War?'' he asked. ``It can be said that this was a
very crucial event affecting the survival of Japan.''
   Literature Professor Tomitaro Karasawa notes that in Japan's
World War II-era curriculums, almost 38 percent of an ethics
textbook and 76 percent of a Japanese language text was militaristic
and imperialistic.
   A poem in a 1918 textbook read: ``Great Japan, Great Japan, we 70
million people respect His Majesty the Emperor as god, as father and
we must serve him.''
   After Japan lost the war, the Education Ministry ordered teachers
to have students ink out such material.

   Utah State University researchers Frank
Salisbury and Bruce Bugbee see beyond hybrid wheat thriving in
hydroponic gardens to a day when their experiments will help feed
human colonies on the moon and Mars.
   It is that vision, of mankind planted safely beyond the pale of
earthly limitations, that has kept the two plant scientists firm in
their commitment to space agriculture _ despite tight funding and
the knowledge they may not live to see their research implemented.
   ``It's long-range research that really has to be done now to be
used later,'' explained Bugbee, 38, the principal researcher for the
university's Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS)
project.
   ``And it's just plain interesting,'' he added. ``Something as
complex as a closed life-support system is just fascinating. We're
trying to duplicate all the functions of planet Earth in a
relatively small capsule.''
   Bugbee and Salisbury, 62, who serves on the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's Aerospace Medical Advisory Committee, say
it could be 30 years or more before a permanent human colony is
established on the moon and another decade beyond that before Mars
is settled.
   Nonetheless, they are assured their work will survive them.
   ``I don't think we can seriously talk about a permanent colony on
the moon or Mars without talking about CELSS,'' Salisbury said.
   Plants raised under hydroponics are grown in nutrient-rich
solutions rather than soil.
   While funding for the hydroponic project _ about $130,000 a year
since it was approved by NASA in 1981 _ is miniscule compared to the
billions spent on the nation's manned space flight program,
Salisbury and Bugbee point with pride to its accomplishments.
   Simulating as closely as possible the conditions of a lunar or
Martian colonial farm through variations in lighting and atmosphere,
the project has grown a Mexican dwarf variety of wheat _ Yecora Rojo
_ with yields of 60 grams of edible wheat per square yard per day.
   That is five times the estimated world record of 12-14 grams,
Salisbury said.
   Salisbury and Bugbee, believing they are near the theoretical
production limits for wheat in a extraterrestrial colony setting,
say they will next turn their attention to wheat's performance in
zero gravity _ a crucial consideration for the day when mankind
embarks on space voyages too long to be sustained by stored food.
   To that end, they are preparing an experiment for a future space
shuttle mission. NASA has approved the project, but it has yet to be
scheduled for flight, the two said in telephone interviews from the
school's campus in Logan, 60 miles north of Salt Lake City.
   Salisbury and Bugbee say a space farm could feed the Mars
mission's crew and purify air and water supplies. For example, a
13-square-yard space farm could feed one person indefinitely.
   Looking beyond exploration to colonization of the moon and Mars,
the researchers believe a farm about the size of a football field
could provide the food and oxygen needs of 100 or more people.
   A hydroponic space farm, unlike those on Earth, would not be
maintained as one huge unit but be made up of a number of
self-contained compartments to guard against the spread of any plant
diseases. Further, it likely would produce far more food than
needed, ranging from 20 percent to 100 percent more, as a hedge
against unexpected losses.
   Failure of a Martian colony's food supply, with help from Earth
at a minimum of 35 million miles away, would be catastrophic.
   Salisbury and Bugbee aren't the only ones researching space food
production.
   The University of Wisconsin has worked on white potatoes, North
Carolina State has worked on soybeans and researchers at Purdue have
experimented with lettuce. Scientists at Tuskegee University have
worked on developing a sweet potato that can be grown on the moon.
   In the Soviet Union, scientists have developed a highly
productive strain of wheat, Salisbury said.
   ``In terms of yield, the Russians are ahead, but ours is more
efficient,'' he said, noting the Soviet space wheat produces more
but requires several times the light that its American counterpart
does.

<TEXT>
   An experiment that could be a precursor to
space colonization was proclaimed a ``huge success'' after a marine
biologist emerged from five days of isolation in a tiny world within
a world.
   Abigail Alling said the 23-square-foot greenhouse-like module
that had cut her off from the rest of Earth's environment since
Wednesday was ``truly paradise.''
   ``The three aspects of science _ the experiment, the experimenter
and the experience _ became a unity,'' Ms. Alling said Monday as she
emerged from the module.
   ``What surprised me was how easy and relaxed the whole thing
was,'' said Ms. Alling, 29.
   ``It's very simple to say how we feel about this,'' said Carl
Hodges, director of the University of Arizona Environmental Research
laboratory. ``It's a huge success. I'm ecstatic.''
   The experiment was part of a privately funded, $30 million
research project designed to see whether human beings can exist in
an enclosed world, possibly as a precursor to space colonization.
Four men and four women are scheduled to enter the 2{-acre
``Biosphere II'' structure in September 1990 for a two-year stay.
   In the experiments, plants and organisms are used to purify the
air and water and to replenish the oxygen supply, according to
Margaret Augustine, the project director.
   Food is grown, harvested and prepared inside the biosphere, and
wastes are biologically treated and recycled for fertilizer, she
said.
   Ms. Alling, a Yale University-trained marine-mammal scientist,
said she enjoyed her stay in the enclosure. She said she busied
herself by harvesting and cooking her own food and working on her
contribution to Biosphere II, which will include a 35-foot-deep,
1-million-gallon ``ocean'' as one of its seven seperate
environmental systems.
   The test module is a self-contained greenhouse about the size of
a single-car garage. It is topped with a futuristic steel-and-glass
canopy rising to a height of 20 feet.
   Lack of room forced the omission of the chicken, fish and goats
that will be included in Biosphere II, but Ms. Alling was able to
choose from a variety of fruits and vegetables for her diet of 2,500
calories a day.
   She stayed in touch with the outside world through a telephone
and computer.
   Two more weeks of experiments will be conducted on the test
module but without a human occupant.
   Even after the two-year test is completed in Biosphere II, Hodges
said, the project will be far from complete.
   ``When we close for two years, that's just another step,'' he
said. ``Biosphere II is designed to last 100 years.''
   The Biosphere II project is located on the 2,500-acre Sun Space
ranch, located near Oracle, a small town at the foot of the Catalina
mountains about 30 miles north of Tucson.
   The ranch is owned by Space Biospheres Ventures, a for-profit
research company financed largely by Texas oilman Edward P. Bass.
   If the project succeeds, Space Biospheres Ventures plans to
market versions of the biosphere to governments and researchers
studying such endeavors as preservation of endangered species or
space colonization.

<HEAD>Calif. Moves Toward Becoming First State To Ban Assault Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill that would make California the
first state to ban assault weapons was approved by the Assembly, but
backers say they face a hurdle in reconciling the measure with one
that passed the Senate.
   ``California has demonstrated that the political power of the
National Rifle Association can be resisted,'' state Attorney General
John Van de Kamp said after Monday's Assembly vote.
   The measure, approved by 41-38, would virtually ban the
possession, sale and manufacture of more than 40 weapons, including
the type of semiautomatic rifle used to kill five Stockton
elementary school children on Jan. 17.
   Last Thursday, the Senate overwhelmingly approved a broader
proposal.
   ``This is the first step in bringing some sort of sanity back to
our communities,'' said Assemblyman Mike Roos, who wrote the bill.
   But the Democratic lawmaker cautioned that supporters still face
problems in getting a compromise bill to Gov. George Deukmejian. The
conservative Republican governor has indicated support for Roos'
proposal but not the Senate's.
   ``It's not down hill,'' Roos said. ``It's going to be vote by
vote. Every time I change a line (in the bill's language) it's a
reason for people to drop off.''
   Roos said he had lost some support for the bill during the
weekend because of last-minute pressure from gun groups.
   Pam Pryor, a spokeswoman for the NRA, acknowledged the bill's
backers ``cleared a pretty big hurdle today,'' but she said her
group would still fight the measures. ``Both of these things have a
long path to travel.''
   The two bills were introduced in January after a deranged
drifter, Patrick Purdy, opened fire at a crowded Stockton
schoolyard, killing five young pupils and wounding 29 and a teacher.
   Purdy sprayed more than 100 rounds with a semiautomatic version
of the AK-47, an assault rifle police say is becoming increasingly
popular with gangs, before killing himself.
   Roos' bill started off identical to the one sponsored by Senate
leader David Roberti, which includes a general definition of assault
weapons. But Roos' bill was restricted in committee to cover about
36 models of rifles, eight types of pistols and three types of
shotguns.
   The measure, with few exceptions, would bar the manufacture,
import, sale, giving or lending of assault weapons after Jan. 1.
   Violations could bring up to three years in prison and a $10,000
fine. Use of the weapons in a felony could lead to an additional
five-year prison term.
   Adults who legally possessed the weapons before this Oct. 1 could
keep them if they register them with the state. Anyone who wanted to
obtain one legally after Sept. 30 and keep it after Jan. 1 would
need the same type of permit required for a machine gun, which is
extremely difficult to obtain.
   Roberti praised the Assembly and said he would seek agreements on
amendments to the Senate version during the Easter recess.
   But one opponent said the state really needs tougher criminal
laws and programs to keep mentally ill people off the streets.
   ``The problem is that Patrick Purdy was allowed on the streets at
all,'' said Assemblyman Tom McClintock, referring to Purdy's history
of crime and mental problems. ``The problem is that Patrick Purdy
was allowed near guns of any kind.''

<HEAD>Eds: Spelling of ``Chornicle'' in 3rd graf is cq.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MURPHY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mock versions of three daily newspapers may
have briefly fooled readers in two states, but officials were not
amused, and at least two papers planned to take legal action against
the imitators.
   Thousands of look-alike front pages attacking U.S. policy in El
Salvador were wrapped around vending machine copies of the San
Francisco Chronicle, Chicago Tribune and The State Journal-Register
in Springfield, Ill., on Monday.
   In a news release delivered to The Associated Press in San
Francisco, a group called Citizens Against the U.S. War in El
Salvador claimed responsibility for the phony front page _ with a
``San Francisco Chornicle'' masthead.
   ``Over 100 activists put over 10,000 copies'' of the special
edition into Chronicle newsboxes in San Francisco, the eastern San
Francisco Bay area and Sonoma County, the statement claimed.
   The real paper planned to pursue charges of product tampering and
copyright infringement against the copycats, said Jessie Knight,
vice president of marketing for the San Francisco Newspaper Agency,
which distributes the Chronicle.
   The bogus page, whose typefaces and makeup resembled those of the
real Chronicle, carried headlines such as ``El Salvador On Verge of
Revolution'' and ``United States Waging War on El Salvador.''
   ``This kind of hoax is not the way to exercise free speech,''
said William German, the Chronicle's executive editor. ``Our readers
will certainly see through it as a fraud upon them as well as the
Chronicle.''
   The Baltimore Sun and The Arizona Daily Star were the targets of
similar stunts in January.
   In Chicago, the Tribune released a statement saying it will
``take every legal step possible to prosecute the people responsible
and prevent any recurrence.''
   ``While the right of free speech and political protest is
understood and appreciated, tampering with the front page of the
Tribune interferes with and distorts our mission as a newspaper and
our right to do business,'' the statement said.
   Several thousand newspapers were covered with the bogus front
page, which had a Chicago Tribune masthead, a spokeswoman said.
   Beneath the masthead, headlines proclaimed ``U.S. at War in El
Salvador'' and ``Death Squad Activities,'' Tribune officials said. A
group calling itself the ``People for a Free El Salvador'' said it
made the switch.
   In Springfield, Ill., Steve Fagan, editor of The State
Journal-Register, said about 30 of their 200 street boxes were
targeted. Those papers said the lampoon was the work of ``People for
a Free El Salvador.''
   ``We view this as a childish prank as well as an incident of
vandalism and criminal trespass,'' Fagan said. ``The worse part of
it is this is an unwarranted intrusion on our readers.''
   Leslie Schuld of the Committee in Solidarity with the People of
El Salvador approved of the effort but did not take credit.
   ``There has been little in the press about what is happening down
there,'' Schuld said in Chicago. ``The Tribune in particular hasn't
been covering the death squad activities adequately.''
   The San Francisco activists' statement said the prank was an
attempt to ``get out the truth about the situation in El Salvador.''
   ``We believe that actions like this can contribute to building a
political movement in the U.S. that can stop the war in El Salvador
and support self-determination for the Salvadoran people,'' it said.

   The dollar held its ground against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices rebounded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished trading at 31,724.35,
regaining 171.39 points, or 0.54 percent. The market's main index
was a 148.82-point loser on Monday.
   The dollar finished trading at 129.92 yen, up 0.35 yen from
Monday's 129.57-yen close. The dollar opened at 130.15 yen, the
first time it opened beyond the 130-yen level since Feb. 2. It
traded between 129.90-130.40 yen.
   Opening higher following comments by Karl Otto Poehl, president
of the West German central bank, the dollar fluctuated as
speculative investors adjusted their positions and took profits,
said Ichiro Takeda of Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   Speaking after a bankers meeting Monday, Poehl said he thought
current West German interest rates could contain inflation and that
the bank had no intention of raising them.
   ``But after Japan's trade surplus was released, investors started
selling some of the dollars they bought earlier, which helped the
yen recover a bit,'' Ikeda said.
   Japan's trade surplus widened for the sixth consecutive month
from year-earlier levels in February, to $7.2 billion dollars from
$5.2 billion dollars, the Finance Ministry announced today.
   ``The market is waiting for the wholesale price index report to
come out later today, which is expected to be higher than last
year's,'' Ikeda said. ``Investors are also concerned about the U.S.
January trade figures due out tomorrow.''
   On the stock market, overnight gains on overseas markets inspired
the Nikkei's rise today, an analyst with Nomura Securities said.
   He said market players stepped to the sidelines before a series
of releases of economic indicators including Japanese trade figures,
the wholesale price index and the U.S. trade figures.
   ``If the wholesale price index growth marks more than 0.3
percentage points, it wouldn't be too good for the stock market,''
the dealer said, adding that it would discourage investors because
price increases can lead to tighter economic policy including
discount rate hikes.
   Increases in the discount rate generally discourage stock trading.
   Trading was moderate, with the first section volume estimated at
800 million shares.

   Villagers protesting practice bombing
by U.S. jet fighters threw rocks and firebombs onto a military range
on the west coast today, forcing it to close for a second day, a
U.S. military spokesman said.
   Three guardhouses along the range's edge were hit by firebombs,
one sustaining minor fire damage, the spokesman said. No injuries
were reported.
   Police arrested nine villagers during the nightlong protest in
front of Koon-ni military range about 70 miles southwest of Seoul,
said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The protesters from the nearby village want the range closed.
   The trouble began early Monday when about 400 villagers tried to
enter the range, protesting ``deafening'' noise made by U.S.
military jets, the U.S. spokesman said.
   About 1,500 policemen surrounded the range and kept protesters
back, the spokesman said. Some villagers fought police with rocks
and sticks, he said.
   About 300 villagers gathered again Monday night and tried to
enter the range through the fence, but police again held them back,
the spokesman said.
   However, the disturbance continued, and several demonstrators
hurled firebombs and rocks into the range, he said.
   The spokesman quoted Maj. John Anderson, the range commander, as
saying the range will be reopened after the repair of 70 feet of
fence also damaged in the protest.
   The U.S. planes that practice at the range are stationed at Osan
and Kunsan air bases.
   Villagers have complained in past weeks that the noise from the
practice bombing runs is unbearable. They have formed a committee to
demand that they be compensated for living with the noise or that
the range be moved.

<HEAD>Convicted Killer Seeks Retrial After 25 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-five years after Kitty Genovese was killed
while neighbors ignored her screams for help, the man convicted of
her murder is seeking a retrial, a newspaper reported today.
   The Genovese case became a nationwide symbol of how fear and
apathy can override compassion.
   Catherine ``Kitty'' Genovese, a 28-year-old bar manager, was
stalked and stabbed to death on a street in Queens on March 13, 1964.
   Thirty-eight people reportedly either saw the attack or heard her
cry ``Help me! Help me! Oh God, he's stabbed me.'' But no one went
to her aid.
   Winston Moseley confessed to the killing and was sentenced to
death, later commuted to life in jail.
   Now Moseley, 54, has filed for a new trial, charging that his
court-appointed lawyer never told him he had been representing
Genovese in a gambling case when she died, the Daily News said.
   The Queens district attorney's office is opposing Moseley's
petition.
   ``There's no possibility at all of any conflict of interest,''
said Richard Piperno, a spokesman for the district attorney. ``There
was no harm accrued to the defendant. He confessed the murder to the
police and at his trial.''
   In papers filed at the trial-level state Supreme Court in Queens,
Moseley claimed that lawyer Sidney Sparrow's silence deprived him of
the right to choose an attorney ``solely interested in my defense,
without any possibility of divided loyalties.
   ``At no time was I informed of this conflicting representation,''
Moseley said. ``The failure of counsel to inform the accused and the
court of a conflict of interest cannot be deemed harmless error.''
   Sparrow, who at 76 still practices law, said he is certain he
told Moseley and the trial judge, J. Irwin Shapiro, that he had
represented Genovese on an appeal of a bookmaking conviction.
   ``I'm sure that in the course of my conversations (with Moseley),
I mentioned I knew her and that I had represented her,'' Sparrow
said.
   ``My representation of Kitty Genovese ended when she died.''
   A hearing on the petition is scheduled for April 6.

<HEAD>Northern Lights Stage Rare Show In Southern States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Police 911 emergency lines lit up as unusually explosive activity
on the sun touched off ``once-in-a-lifetime'' sightings of the
``northern lights,'' causing jitters as far south as Texas and
Florida.
   Worried sky watchers thought they spotted wildfires or falling
debris from the space shuttle Discovery, but scientists advised
people to sit back and marvel at the unusual occurrence.
   ``Wow! Enjoy the show!'' said a special advisory issued Monday by
the National Weather Service in Fort Worth, Texas. ``It is an
extremely rare event for the southern latitudes of the U.S. In fact,
it would be a quintessential once-in-a-lifetime event.''
   Jack Horkheimer, director of the Miami Space Transit Planetarium
and a astronomy expert for the Public Broadcasting System, said he
had not seen the northern lights in his 25 years in southern Florida.
   ``For you to see them down here is rarer than snow,'' he said.
   Chris Balch, a forecaster for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., said that multicolored
lights in the nighttime sky, usually visible only in or near the
Arctic Circle, were reported late Sunday and early Monday in
Pennsylvania, New York, Detroit and Colorado. Sightings also were
reported in Delaware, Indiana and Georgia. But in much of the
nation, clouds or haze obscured the show.
   Northern lights, also called aurora borealis, and their
counterpart in the Southern Hemisphere are believed to result as
tiny charged particles that pour out by the sun during solar flares
strike the Earth's upper atmosphere hours or days later.
   The geomagnetic storms, caused as the charged particles smash
into the Earth's magnetic field, can also disrupt satellites and
communications on Earth, but Balch said he had heard no reports of
significant problems.
   Experts differed on whether the continuing disturbance on the sun
is likely to mean more northern lights this week.
   Joe Allen, a NOAA solar-terrestrial expert in Boulder, said he
thought there was a good chance of further northern lights displays
this week across the northern third of the country.
   But Balch said that although the forecast could change if another
huge solar flare bursts out, ``We're not really looking for the
northern lights to continue.''
   In Utah, the northern lights early Monday covered about 40
percent of the sky at one point. Those who rose early enough to
witness them reported seeing a shifting curtain of red or purple
light with occasional vertical white streaks, moving from the
northeast to the northwest and back again.
   ``It was the most brilliant display of northern lights any of our
people can remember in the last 30 years,'' said Bill Alder, chief
meteorologist at the weather service's Salt Lake City office.
   In Florida and Texas, the northern lights caused mass confusion.
   ``I've been having a lot of calls,'' said Ignacio Casanova, a
dispatcher with the Cameron County Sheriff's Department in
Brownsville near the Mexico border. ``They're just callings to find
out what it is. On 911, I've had about 10 calls. They're worried
about what's going on.''
   In Anchorage, Alaska, where the northern lights are far more
common than in the lower 48 states, the color display seemed to last
longer than usual, with viewers reporting sightings over 6{ hours
Sunday evening to early Monday.
   Clear skies provided a clear view for watching the ever-changing
lights dance around a quarter moon. But the lights Sunday night were
not as brilliant as they have been on some sightings in Anchorage,
when greens, blues and reds bounce off snow-covered mountains under
a full moon.

<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas claim to have
captured part of the key eastern city of Jalalabad, but the
government says the insurgents were routed in their first major
offensive since the Soviet pullout.
   Government and rebel troops have clashed at Jalalabad since March
6 in the first major test of communist defenses since the Red Army
ended its nine-year intervention in Afghanistan one month ago.
   Official Radio Kabul and the Soviet news agency Tass said Monday
that Afghan regime forces had repulsed about 14,000 insurgents and
3,000 ``Pakistani advisers'' after a week of heavy fighting.
   ``As a result of the heroism and power of the armed forces, (the
insurgents) faced shameful and deadly defeat,'' the radio said in a
broadcast monitored in Islamabad.
   Communist sources claimed government troops killed more than
2,000 of the attackers, but guerrillas put their losses at about 100
dead and 400 wounded. Pakistan, which supports the anti-Marxist
insurgents, denies it has any combat troops in neighboring
Afghanistan.
   The guerrillas, called mujahedeen or ``holy warriors,'' said
Monday they had captured Jalalabad's key garrison at Samarkhel,
breached part of the airport perimeter and were holding the old
section of the city.
   They claimed to have captured about 700 regime troops, most of
them from Samarkhel.
   Ghaus Amer of the Afghan News Agency, an organ of hardline
guerrilla leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, today described a lull in
fighting the previous 24 hours as a change of tactics: ``The
mujahedeen are now switching to increase the siege of the city to
avoid further bloodshed.''
   It was not clear whether the insurgents were preparing an
immediate second attack.
   Correspondents and other eyewitnesses arriving in Pakistan have
described intense aerial shelling of mujahedeen positions between
Jalalabad and the border, 33 miles to the east.
   They estimated hundreds of insurgents and fleeing civilians were
killed but had no precise figures.
   The capture of Jalalabad, a city of about 200,000, would be a
crucial moral victory for the guerrillas, who are fighting to
establish an Islamic republic of Afghanistan.
   The fight for the capital of Nangarhar province has sent
thousands of Afghans fleeing over the border to Pakistan and filled
hospitals in this country with hundreds of wounded.
   The United States, Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia are the main
military backers of the mujahedeen.
   Pakistan already shelters more than 3 million refugees of the
decade-long war and Iran hosts about 2 million.
   Hekmatyar, foreign minister in an interim government established
by Pakistan-based guerrillas, said Monday that the insurgents are
capable at any time of taking Jalalabad and the rest of Afghanistan.
   Hekmatyar, who was in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Monday for a
meeting of the Organization of Islamic Conference, said Najib's
government ``will fall within weeks.''
   ``We are perfectly capable of overrunning Kabul and Jalalabad and
other regions, but we prefer to delay military action in inhabited
regions. We do not want to spill blood any more.''
   He said a qualified organization would be selected to estimate
the amount of Afghanistan's losses as a result of the Soviet
military intervention and how much ``Moscow should pay us in
reparations.''

<HEAD>Romania Arrests Diplomat Linked to Letter Critical of President</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES thruout with senior diplomat charged with spying, diplomats
linking charge to letter critical of Ceausescu. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania today said it has charged with
spying a senior diplomat whose father and five other veteran
Communists reportedly petitioned President Nicolae Ceausescu to stop
repressing his people.
   In a bold challenge to the autocratic Romanian leader, the six
demanded in a January letter that he improve human rights and stop
exporting food from his shortage-plagued country, emigre sources say.
   The official Romanian news agency Agerpres said Mircea Raceanu,
who was arrested Jan. 31 in Bucharest, had been charged with spying
for a foreign power and engaged in ``steady treasonable action''
since 1974.
   Agerpress did not name the power.
   Raceanu had served for several years in Romania's embassy in
Washington in the 1970s and as deputy head of the Foreign Ministry's
U.S. desk in Bucharest _ and emigre sources said he was arrested en
route to the U.S. ambassador's residence.
   The official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted unidentified
diplomatic sources in the Romanian capital as linking the arrest to
the letter to Ceausescu.
   Raceanu's father, Ion Raceanu, had joined the other veteran
officials in criticizing Ceausescu's plans to destroy up to 7,000 of
the country's 13,000 villages in a resettlement campaign, according
to a text of the letter made available to The Associated Press.
   The letter's six signatories are all retired senior leaders, two
of them former Politburo members. Their initiative marks the first
time senior Communists have banded together to protest Ceausescu's
stern policies, suggesting dissatisfaction in party ranks.
   The letter condemns a late 1970s decree that forbids Romanians to
speak to foreigners.
   It also criticizes the use of secret police against ``workers
demanding their rights, against old members of the party, and honest
intellectuals exercising their right to petition ....''
   And it decries forced Sunday labor and alleged systematic
violations of private mail and phone communication.
   The letter accuses Ceausescu of damaging Romania's economy and
reputation.
   ``You started changing the geography of the countryside, but you
cannot remove Romania to Africa,'' the text says, alluding to
Romania's increasing international isolation.
   ``How are you going to improve Romania's external relations when
all the leaders of the non-communist nations of Europe refuse to
meet with you?''
   The letter demands that Ceausescu immediately renounce plans to
destroy the villages, restore constitutional guarantees to meet
European human rights agreements, and halt food exports.
   In announcing the arrest, Agerpres made no mention of the letter,
saying only that the state security bodies had ``uncovered a grave
action of betrayal of the interests of the Romanian people and
state'' by Raceanu.
   It said he managed to supply unspecified ``secret data and
intelligence'' to the unidentified power for which he allegedly
worked.
   Agerpres did not say what sentence Raceanu faces if convicted.
The maximum penalty for treason is death.
   The emigre sources said both Raceanu and his wife were initially
detained while en route to the U.S. ambassador's residence but that
she was later freed. A Western diplomat in Bucharest confirmed by
telephone that Raceanu was invited but didn't appear.
   After that, Raceanu was said to have been transferred from his
post at the Foreign Ministry, the diplomat said.

   Actress Melanie Griffith says she's had it with
alcohol. And she insists that this time she means it.
   ``Nothing works if I drink,'' the star of ``Working Girl'' said
in April's Ladies' Home Journal. ``It's a battle and you lie and you
deceive yourself and other people. All that's gone away. There's no
more of that in my life and I struggle to be honest.''
   The 31-year-old Griffith, who is pregnant and plans to remarry
``Miami Vice'' star Don Johnson, says she thinks she finally solved
her problems with drinking during rehabilitation last spring at the
Hazelden Foundation in Minnesota.
   ``It changed my life. I'm still battling the devil over here on
my shoulder, but if I go one day at a time, I can do it,'' she said.
   Now, she added, all she wants is a normal life.
   ``To be an actor you have to have a life,'' she said. ``Actors
that are just in the mirror and want to make great movies are full
of it. You have to have life experience and people experience.''

   A Liberian-registered tanker laden with thousands of
tons of toxic chemicals exploded in flames today, spewing out poison
gases that prevented rescuers from searching for 23 missing crew
members, officials said.
   The 23,038-ton Maasgusar was engulfed in flames about 61 miles
off the Pacific coast of central Japan.
   ``Rescue and fire teams can't even approach because of the blaze
and poisonous gas from burned chemicals that the vessel was
carrying,'' said Yoshi Nakamura, a spokesman for the Maritime Safety
Agency. ``We just have to stand by and wait for the fire to burn out
by itself.''
   Nakamura said the tanker's 25,000 tons of petroleum-based
chemicals _ including ethylene chloride, isopropyl benzene and
paraxylene _ had begun to leak into the ocean.
   He said the vessel was afloat but tilting to port. Most
structures on the deck had burned down, he said.
   The crew of 23 men, including 19 from the Philippines and four
from Britain, were missing. The coast guard earlier identified the
captain as Rickard James, 50, from Britain.
   The rescue team found four lifeboats, but they were empty, the
Maritime Safety Agency said.
   The Maasgusar was heading for Yokohama from Houston when it
caught fire, officials said.

<HEAD>Cambodian Resistance Leaders Take First Step Toward Unified Command</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's often-fractious resistance forces took
a first step today toward unifying their armies by forming a defense
council headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   In their joint statement, the leaders also announced a ``common
political program'' calling for a multiparty parliamentary
government with ``Western democracy'' and free enterprise in
Cambodia after the Vietnamese withdraw.
   ``All of them (the rebel forces) now are practically under my
command,'' said Sihanouk, the president of a three-party Cambodian
government-in-exile that is fighting the Vietnamese, who invaded in
1978.
   Sihanouk, who lives part of the year in Beijing, announced the
new High Council for National Defense together with his two partners
in the resistance government, communist Khmer Rouge leader Khieu
Samphan; and Son Sann, who heads a smaller nationalist party.
   The three have been holding closed-door meetings in Beijing since
Sunday to discuss Cambodia's future in view of Vietnam's rejection
of Sihanouk's peace proposals and a planned Chinese-Soviet summit in
May.
   Sihanouk said he was confident that China, a main backer of the
Cambodian resistance, will not drop its support to reach agreement
with the Soviets on a speedy Vietnamese withdrawal. Moscow is
Vietnam's main ally.
   ``I am 100 percent sure (China) will continue to support my plan
and support us,'' Sihanouk said. A Vietnamese withdrawal that leaves
the Vietnamese client government of Hun Sen to confront the
resistance ``a la Afghanistan'' is not acceptable, the prince said.
   In Afghanistan, Soviets troops have withdrawn and left Afghan
forces to fight rebels.
   Sihanouk predicted that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping will agree at their May 15
summit to pressure Hun Sen and Vietnam into accepting his plan. It
calls for U.N. supervision of a Vietnamese pullout and free
elections under a provisional government representing all parties.
   Vietnam has said it will withdraw by September if a political
agreement can be reached on Cambodia's future, but it promised to
leave in 1990 whatever the case.
   The main snag in advancing that plan has been the refusal of
Vietnam and Hun Sen to accept Khmer Rouge participation in a future
government and U.N. supervision. The United States, which helps the
resistance, has also been wary of a return of the Khmer Rouge to
power.
   The Khmer Rouge seized power and killed at least 1 million people
in a reign of terror from 1975 to 1978 under Pol Pot, who is said to
have retired.
   Sihanouk said Khieu Samphan has agreed Pol Pot will remain out of
the picture.
   ``If they break their promise,'' Sihanouk said, turning to Khieu
Samphan, ``my army will fight them indefinitely.''
   Khieu Samphan, smiling broadly, said his party was willing to
``accept realities'' in order to end Vietnam's occupation.
   The possible role of the Khmer Rouge has been one of the main
sources of conflict within the three-party resistance. Sihanouk has
accused its forces of repeated attacks on his army.
   However, he told the news conference no new attacks have occurred
in several months and that one role for the new defense council will
be to resolve such conflicts.
   The joint statement said the council will ensure ``solidarity,
cooperation and mutual respect and assistance'' among the three
resistance armies. It did not say in detail how that would be
achieved.
   Sihanouk said the council is a first step toward uniting the
three armies in a national Cambodian army in the near future. For
now, the three armies will keep their own commanders.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with seven grafs to UPDATE with quotes on death, funeral
arrangements; Picks up 5th pvs: `Her eyesight ...'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZIZERS, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Austria's last empress, Zita, who
played a key role in a failed effort to negotiate peace during World
War I, died today. She was 96.
   Born in Italy as a princess of Bourbon-Parma, Zita was the widow
of Charles I, the last crowned head of the Hapsburg dynasty that
ruled for 640 years.
   She died at 1:30 a.m. at Johannes-Stift, a home for the aged run
by Franciscan nuns at this wine-growing village on the Upper Rhine.
   A spokesman for the House of Hapsburg, Bernd Posselt, said she
had not been treated for any particular illness but ``just faded
away'' after ailing for some time.
   Posselt said her eldest son, Otto von Hapsburg, received word of
her death while attending a meeting of the European Parliament at
Strasbourg. Otto left for Switzerland, where a private funeral
ceremony was scheduled for Wednesday.
   Zita is to lie in state for three days at St. Stephen's Cathedral
in Vienna and a requiem Mass is to be held April 1, the 67th
anniversary of the death of her husband. She is to be interred in
the Hapsburg vaults of Vienna's Capuchin Church.
   Zita had lived at Johannes-Stift for the past three decades. Two
plainly furnished rooms were the home of the woman who once held
court at the Versailles-sized castle of Schoenbrunn in Vienna.
   Her eyesight faded in recent years, but intellectually she was
described as alert as ever. Fluent in five languages, she remained
keenly interested in world affairs and had newspapers from several
countries read to her regularly even as she turned 95.
   Her husband had ruled over a multi-lingual empire of 50 million
people stretching from what is now Poland to the Mediterranean.
After the Allied victory in World War I, he agreed to ``temporarily
relinquish'' his imperial rights. But he never officially abdicated.
   Zita, a mother of eight and a devout Roman Catholic, wore
mourning black from the time Charles died in exile on the island of
Madeira in 1922.
   Tragedy surrounded the ascent of her husband. He was crowned
emperor of Austria and King of Hungary after the death in 1916 of
his uncle, Francis Joseph, who had reigned 68 years.
   Francis Joseph's wife, Elisabeth, was fatally stabbed by an
Italian anarchist in Geneva in 1897. Their son, Crown Prince Rudolf,
killed himself in a suicide pact with his mistress in 1889. And
their nephew, Francis Ferdinand, the new heir presumptive, was shot
by a Serbian assassin in Sarajevo in 1914, triggering World War I.
   After his coronation, Charles I, initiated moves in 1916 to
negotiate a peace he hoped would save the Austrian monarchy. Zita
helped arrange secret contacts with the Allies.
   The go-between was her brother, Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma,
then serving in the Belgian army, who was in touch with French
President Raymond Poincare. In turn, Poincare notified King George V
of Britain.
   The Austrian efforts were revealed by France in early 1918,
causing an uproar and rocking the Austrian-German alliance. Austrian
hawks fanned public ire and the once-popular Zita became known as
the ``spy of the Bournons.''
   The 1918 exodus from Schoenbrunn Castle was the beginning of a
long odyssey.
   Initially, Charles took exile in a Lake Geneva chateau at
Prangins, Switzerland. But after launching from there an abortive
combeack attempt, he was banished to the Portuguese island of
Madeira where he died a year later at age 34.
   A widow at 29, Zita turned down invitations from royal relatives
and instead chose to bring up her children in modest environments,
first in a Spanish fishing village and then in the Belgian
countryside where she raised chicken and sheep to help augment the
family menu.
   Hitler's Blitzkrieg sent the family fleeing to Canada and the
United States where they lived at Tuxedo Park, N.Y. After the war,
Zita toured many American cities to promote humanitarian aid for
Europe.
   In the early 1950's, she returned to Europe and settled at
Zizers, only a few hours drive from the postwar home of her oldest
son. She curtsied before him when Otto, at age 18, became the new
titular head of the Hapsburg dynasty.
   Although the Austrian border is only about 18 miles from Zizers,
she did not visit the country for 63 years. An Austrian law, enacted
after the revolution in 1919, allowed entry only to those members of
the Hapsburg family who pledged allegiance to the Austrian republic.
   All but Zita signed the pledge. ``My mother felt that abdication
would have amounted to a betrayal of my father,'' Otto explained
once.
   In 1982, Austria relaxed the ban following a personal request by
Spain's King Juan Carlos, a relative of Zita. At her first visit to
Vienna, she was cheered by a crowd of 10,000 when she appeared at
evening mass in St. Stephen's cathedral.

<HEAD>Chicagoan Ends Nearly Six Decades In Soviet Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soon, Abe Stolar will be able to claim the
luggage that left Moscow more than a dozen years before he did.
   Stolar, a Chicago-born Jew who spent 58 years in the Soviet
Union, arrived in Vienna on Monday with his wife, son,
daughter-in-law and two grandchildren.
   ``Even in the plane, I still felt paranoic, I still felt we
weren't safe,'' said the 77-year-old Stolar.
   Stolar, who was taken to the Soviet Union in 1931 by his
communist parents, had tried to leave in 1975. He got as far as the
entrance ramp of his plane at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, only to
have the authorities drag him and his family back.
   Their luggage went on Israel, their destination. It's been
waiting for them since, throughout the long battle to emigrate that
took two superpower summits and heavy lobbying by U.S. congressmen
to finally win.
   The whole family was subdued and tired after their 2{-hour flight
from Moscow to Vienna.
   ``At last I got free, that's all I feel,'' said Stolar's wife,
Zita.
   ``It did feel great to get off the plane,'' Stolar said. ``Just
walking into this building, you could feel right away that it wasn't
Russia.''
   ``It's really wonderful to be here, great, even though I haven't
seen anything yet, I haven't felt anything yet,'' he said as he
received a hug from Linda Opper, a member of a Chicago Jewish action
group that kept Stolar's case alive.
   He waved an ``I Love Chicago'' button he said he'd been saving
for the arrival. ``And Chicago loves you,'' Ms. Opper said.
   Stolar's parents, Russian emigres, fled the Depression and
arrived in a Soviet Union where Josef Stalin was just starting the
wave of mass collectivization and purges.
   Stolar's father was among the millions who perished in the
purges. Stolar remained in Moscow, and worked for 20 years until his
retirement in the mid-1970s as an English-language translator at
Radio Moscow.
   But he was disenchanted with Soviet life and decided to join the
wave of Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel.
   In 1975, Stolar, his wife and son, Michael, got almost to the
plane when officials pulled them back, saying his wife was privy to
state secrets and could not leave for at least another two years.
   In some ways, the Stolars were better off than other
``refuseniks'' _ those denied permission to leave the Soviet Union.
Stolar had a U.S. passport, as did his son. In 1977, Israel granted
a passport to Stolar's wife.
   Although foreigners, they couldn't leave. And since they had
given up Soviet citizenship _ a Soviet requirement for emigration to
Israel _ they found themselves in a bureaucratic limbo.
   They had given up their apartment and couldn't officially
register to live in another. When Michael married in 1983, he
couldn't go through with official ceremonies because he was not
registered to live in Moscow.
   In 1985, then-President Reagan held his first meeting with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Geneva, and the Stolars were on the
list Reagan handed Gorbachev of emigration cases he wanted solved.
   The Soviets granted the wish, but refused to let Michael's wife
and their newborn daughter go.
   Stolar said he thinks the case was finally solved through the
summit meeting Gorbachev and Reagan held in Moscow, although it took
several more months to pry loose exit visas.
   Stolar said in Moscow earlier Monday that he did not consider
himself a ``refusenik'' because he always has been a U.S. citizen.
   `I was an American, pure and simple, and so I considered myself a
hostage all these 13 years,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in thin, early European
trading today as the market waited for American economic indicators
to lift it out of its week-long doldrums. Gold prices rose.
   U.S. retail sales figures for February were to be released later
today and trade figures for January are to be released on Wednesday.
   Foreign currency dealers said the potential for the dollar to
rise on better-than-expected trade figures is larger than the
potential to fall on a disappointing trade deficit.
   ``Underlying sentiment is still bullish (for the dollar),'' said
one trader in Rome, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``For me
there's more room on the upside than on the downside.''
   Economists expect the deficit to be lower than December's $10.2
billion.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 129.92. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 130.08 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.8665 West German marks, down from 1.8669
   _1.5965 Swiss francs, unchanged
   _6.3260 French francs, up from 6.3230
   _2.1060 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1040
   _1,368.90 Italian lire, up from 1,367.40
   _1.1973 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1981
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7128, marginally more
expensive for buyers than $1.7125 Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $394 a troy ounce, up
from $392.25 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $394.30.
   The bid price was also $394.30 in Zurich, up from $392.75 bid
late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 52 cents to close at a bid
$395.37.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.07 a troy ounce,
up from Monday's $6.02.

<TEXT>
   The PLO-backed leadership of the Palestinian
uprising issued a leaflet today rejecting U.S. calls for an easing
of tension and vowing to ``continue and escalate'' the rebellion.
   The underground leaders discounted U.S. criticism of Palestinian
guerrillas' attempts to infiltrate Israel from Lebanon and demanded
``serious and constructive dialogue'' with the Bush administration.
   The leaflet called for two days of general strikes and the
boycott of Israeli products, and issued a warning to Arabs working
for the military government in occupied lands.
   ``Consider this leaflet as a last warning to them,'' said the
leaflet distributed in Jerusalem and the West Bank. ``If they don't
resign, the strike forces will strike them violently.''
   The leaflet praised Israel's Peace Now movement, which has
engaged in a series of public discussions with Palestinians. But it
signaled no flexibility towards lessening confrontations in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We will continue and escalate the intefadeh ...,'' it said.
Intefadeh is the Arabic term for the uprising.
   The statement came a day after Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of
Israel met in Washington with President Bush and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III.
   To create a climate for negotiations, U.S. officials urged Israel
and the PLO to reduce the level of conflict both in Lebanon and in
the occupied territories.
   Baker told reporters he was seeking ``various reinforcing and
reciprocal steps which might be taken to defuse tension'' in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   According to unofficial counts, 396 Palestinians and 17 Israelis
have been killed since Palestinians launched their uprising against
Israeli rule in the territories in December 1987.
   Today, four Palestinians _ a 7-year-old boy and three teen-agers
_ were shot and wounded by Israeli troops in a stone-throwing clash
in the Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, Arab reports said.
   The army said it was checking the report.
   U.S. officials reportedly urged Israel to take a number of
measures such as withdrawing troops from heavily populated areas,
releasing some of the 5,000 Palestinian detainees, reopening schools
and allowing freer travel.
   The PLO would be asked to limit violent demonstrations and
provocative leaflets and halt anti-Israeli raids from Lebanon.
   Arens told Israel radio today that Baker ``was of the opinion it
was important to reduce tension ... to take steps that could bring
that about. But he didn't elaborate what steps.''
   Arens added: ``I said nobody is interested in reducing this
tension more than us but how to do it is another question.''
   The Hebrew daily newspaper Maariv quoted unnamed sources in
Jerusalem as saying Israel would continue to bypass the PLO, which
it considers a terrorist organization, and pursue efforts to deal
directly with Palestinians who live in the occupied territories.
   The latest underground leaflet condemned ``Zionist terrorism'' in
which it alleged Israeli soldiers purposefully killed and wounded
demonstators, demolished homes and arrested thousands of
Palestinians.
   It termed the U.S. proposals for lessening tension as ``political
blackmail'' and said U.S. efforts to label Palestinian guerrilla
attacks from Lebanon as terrorism represented ``a one-sided
manipulation of the media that does not distinguish between
terrorism and legitimate resistance.''
   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, commander of the northern zone, said 20
Palestinian guerrillas have been killed attempting to infiltrate in
the last month.

<HEAD>Savimbi Offers Concessions, Denies Reports of Torture</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JAMBA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the rebel army fighting
Angola's Marxist government says he's called a four-month halt to
attacks in an effort to produce peace talks, and denies reports he
has tortured and killed critics.
   Rebel chief Jonas Savimbi, who spoke at a news conference Monday
on the 23rd anniversary of the founding of his UNITA movement, even
brought forward an alleged victim of abuses to personally refute the
claims.
   The New York Times, in a dispatch Saturday from London, quoted
former UNITA supporters as saying Savimbi ordered the torture and
killing of rebel dissidents.
   It said Tito Chingunji, former UNITA representative in
Washington, was being held against his will in Jamba, the rebels'
southern Angolan stronghold.
   Asked at a news conference about the allegations in the Times,
Savimbi referred reporters to Chingunji, now deputy
secretary-general of UNITA, who appeared along with Savimbi.
   Chingunji said the reports were ``lies attempting to split the
UNITA leadership.''
   Other leaders of UNITA, the National Union of the Total
Independence of Angola, described recent reports by the British
Broadcasting Corp. and The New York Times alleging UNITA human
rights abuses as ``propaganda.''
   In an interview at his headquarters in southeastern Angola,
Savimbi said his U.S.-backed movement would refrain from launching
any military offensive against the government until July 15 to allow
for a possible diplomatic breakthrough in the stalemated war.
   ``We are optimistic that there will be progress,'' Savimbi said.
``If there is no production of goods by then we resume offensive
operations.''
   The government has refused to negotiate with the rebels, even
though there is little prospect for a military victory by either
side in the 14-year civil war. Savimbi acknowledges he cannot win a
conventional war against the Cuban-backed government forces, but his
rebels have for years controlled about a third of this sparsely
populated country of 9 million people.
   Savimbi said officials from several African states _ including
Zaire, Congo and the Ivory Coast _ met with Angolan officials
earlier this month in an attempt to launch peace talks.
   He also said UNITA leaders would be meeting with Cuban military
officials in the Ivory Coast in about two weeks to discuss the
withdrawal of Cuba's 50,000 troops from Angola.
   Savimbi has pledged not to attack withdrawing Cuban forces.
   Cuba has agreed to a phased withdrawal as part of a regional
peace pact also signed by Angola and South Africa. The South
Africans have agreed to grant independence to neighboring Namibia
and to end assistance to UNITA, which still receives aid from the
United States.
   At his news conference, Savimbi also offered to bow out of peace
talks and instead send other rebel leaders. The Angolan government
has been adamant in refusing any contact with Savimbi.
   He further said the rebels would not interfere with
reconstruction of the strategic east-west Benguela railway,
destroyed by rebel attacks, and he said he would be willing to
release 100 captured government troops.

<HEAD>Ex-Hostage Says `Satanic Verses' Hurts Prospects for Anderson's Release</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DARREN DOPP</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publication of ``The Satanic Verses'' has
reduced the likelihood that Terry Anderson will be released soon
from Lebanon, said the Rev. Lawrence M. Jenco, a former hostage in
Lebanon.
   ``The doors have been slammed shut again,'' said Jenco, who was
here Monday for a prayer service for Anderson, the longest held of
15 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Meanwhile, six organizations are asking news media around the
world to publicize the fourth anniversary of Terry Anderson's
kidnapping on Thursday.
   ``Today, March 16, 1989, the American journalist Terry Anderson,
41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press in
Beirut, entered his fifth year of captivity as a hostage in
Lebanon,'' said a statement that the groups asked broadcasters to
air and newspapers to use on their front pages.
   The ``statement of solidarity with Anderson'' is from ``the
leading freedom of expression organizations in the Western world,''
Anne Nelson, executive director of the New York-based Committee to
Protect Journalists, said Monday.
   In Buffalo, Jenco said Americans should show some support toward
Moslems who have been offended by ``The Satanic Verses'' by British
author Salman Rushdie.
   ``We don't need books that degrade. It was a stupid thing,'' he
said.
   The Rev. Jenco's comments came a day after Peggy Say, Anderson's
sister, said the book had increased tensions between the West and
Moslem extremists and was an impediment to the release of the
hostages.
   Jenco, campus minister at the University of Southern California,
shared a cell with Anderson in 1986.
   He told an audience of about 100 at St. Paul's Episcopal Church
that Anderson's life in captivity was filled with suffering.
   ``Terry's only refuge was prayer and the hope that his countrymen
will not forget him,'' he said.
   Mrs. Say and Jenco and other hostage families will gather in
Washington Thursday to mark the anniversary of Anderson's abduction.
   Ms. Nelson said she will read the statement of solidarity with
Anderson at the National Press Club in Washington Thursday.
   Other organizations urging publication of the anniversary
statement are: Article 19 of London; International Federation of
Publishers in Paris; the International Federation of Journalists in
Brussels; Index on Censorship in London; and Observatoire de
L'Information in France.
   The International Federation of Journalists also asked its
150,000 members in 37 nations to draw attention to the plight of
British journalist John McCarthy, who marked his 1,000th day of
captivity on Jan. 10.
   Elsewhere, Charles Dale, the president of the Newspaper Guild of
the United States and Canada, will lead a delegation to the U.S.
State Department in Washington on Thursday.
   In Strasbourg, France, French journalist and former hostage
Jean-Paul Kauffmann will meet with European Parliament leaders to
press for the hostages' release.

   Islamic foreign ministers met today
to arrange a swap of prisoners between Iran and Iraq and discuss
ways to revive peace talks between the longtime foes, sources said.
   The ministers, meeting under the auspices of the 46-member
Organization of Islamic Conference, also planned to discuss post-war
reconstruction projects in the Persian Gulf nations.
   Conference sources said the meetings were also expected to try
and heal the rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia and hopefully talk
the two Islamic powers into resuming diplomatic relations.
   Saudi Arabia severed ties with Iran last year to protest alleged
Iranian attempts to instigate Shiite Moslem supporters to sabotage
oil and public utility installations in the kingdom.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
ministers hope to convince Iran and Iraq to accept a simultaneous
release of all prisoners of war. A U.N.-brokered cease-fire halted
eight years of hostilities between Iran and Iraq on Aug. 20 but
peace talks launched five days later have been deadlocked over the
issue of troop withdrawals.
   Both countries are members of the Islamic Conference. Tehran sent
a low-ranking delegation to the meeting.
   Conference members, mainly Arab countries, were expected to
criticize Iran's efforts to export its fundamentalist revolution to
neighboring nations, the sources said.
   The Iranian delegation was expected to appeal to the conference's
foreign ministers to support Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's edict
urging Moslems to kill British writer Salman Rushdie for allegedly
blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Saudi Arabia has criticized Rushdie and banned his book, but
would not support Khomeini's death threat.
   Arab diplomatic sources have said the Saudis will resist Iran's
attempts to project Khomeini as defender of Islam. They said
Khomeini was bent on using the Rushdie affair to arouse public
sentiment, hoping to improve unfavorable political conditions at
home.
   Moslems were offended by a scene in Rushdie's book where
prostitutes take their names after prophet Mohammed's four wives. In
the novel, Rushdie also suggests that Mohammed wrote the Koran, the
holy book of Islam, rather than receiving it directly from God.
   The conference sessions were held behind closed doors, and the
Saudis were understood to have argued that Khomeini's order only
portrays Moslems as bloodthirsty and precipitates unnecessary rifts
with the West.
   Conference sources said the Saudis were to offer a compromise
proposal based on sending conference delegations to Western
countries to request that Rushdie's book be denounced and banned.
   Meanwhile, the Saudi newspaper Okaz reported that the conference
was to discuss collective action to regain the Arab sector of
Jerusalem. Okaz said that Islamic Conference member nations want the
sector of Jerusalem occupied by Israel in 1967 to become capital of
a Palestinian state.
   The foreign ministers, it said, plan to discuss ways to bolster
the Palestinian uprising against Israel in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.

<HEAD>Party Leaders Vote To Replace Botha</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frederik W. de Klerk, chosen by
the governing party as South Africa's next head of state, says party
leaders will meet with President P.W. Botha but will not press him
to resign immediately.
   The National Party's Parliament members voted unanimously Monday
to back de Klerk as head of state.
   But Botha, who is 73 and suffered a stroke in January, has said
he plans to return to work Wednesday and wants to stay in office at
least until next year.
   ``There will be discussions with him with regard to his position
and there is nothing in the decision that says he must now step
down,'' de Klerk told reporters after the National Party vote.
   ``I am the leader-in-chief of the National Party and the decision
was, in principle, that the leader-in-chief of the National Party
should be state president.''
   Botha made no immediate response to the announcement by the
governing party's parliamentary caucus. The president has been
active in National Party politics since 1935 and has led the
government since 1978.
   A power struggle between Botha and de Klerk, 52, has intensified
since Botha resigned as party leader Feb. 2, two weeks after the
stroke. It worsened Sunday, when Botha said de Klerk ``had been
misused by some people'' and said he would not call early elections
this year.
   The party leader has no policy-making powers, and there has been
widespread support in the parliamentary caucus for de Klerk to share
that power with Botha or replace him altogether.
   De Klerk, who has been education minister, is widely viewed as
more open-minded than Botha and more likely to end the black-white
political stalemate.
   Under the constitution adopted in 1984, South Africa's president
is chosen by an electoral college controlled by members of the party
with a majority in Parliament. The electoral college convenes after
a general election.
   Party leaders met for more than three hours Monday before the
caucus passed the resolution, which said it was in the national
interest for the same person to be president and party leader.
   It said the Cabinet should discuss the position with Botha, but
did not say when. De Klerk said the resolution did not imply the
president should resign immediately.
   Until Botha quit the job six weeks ago, the man serving as party
chief had led the government throughout the National Party's 40
years in power.
   In a report after the caucus announcement, the independent South
African Press Association said: ``The statement after the caucus
meeting is an unequivocal demand that Mr. Botha step down and get
out of Mr. de Klerk's way. It is now expected to be merely a matter
of time and procedure to arrange for the departure of Mr. Botha.''
   News reports said many National Party officials were angered by
Botha's refusal to call elections early. The latest election date
mentioned is March 1990.
   A party official was quoted in The Star as saying the ``situation
is intolerable and will have to be settled this week.'' The official
was not identified.
   Botha said in a television interview Sunday, after describing de
Klerk as ``misused,'' that the new party leader was ``one of my good
advisers'' and there was no personal conflict. He appeared healthy
and said he wanted to remain in office because it was his duty.

<HEAD>American Actor Maurice Evans Dies in England</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHTON, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor and Broadway producer Maurice
Evans, who starred in Shakespeare on the London stage and later
displayed his versatility in American television series, has died in
his native England. He was 87.
   Evans died early Sunday in the Seadowns Nursing Home in
Rottingdean outside Brighton, the local coroner's office said today.
   Cause of death is thought to be heart failure, said a spokesman
for the office, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Evans produced such Broadway hits as ``Teahouse of the August
Moon,'' ``Dial M for Murder'' and ``No Time for Sergeants.''
   The naturalized American has portrayed Macbeth, Hamlet and
Richard III on American television, but he also appeared in many
lighter roles: the Puzzler on ``Batman,'' Sir Basil Bertram on
``Tarzan,'' Samantha's frequently absent father on ``Bewitched,''
and a French spy on ``Daniel Boone.''
   His film credits include ``Rosemary's Baby'' and ``The Planet of
the Apes,'' in which he played a leader of the ape planet.
   ``He had been ill,'' said George Schaefer, a longtime friend and
dean of theater, film and TV for the University of California, Los
Angeles.
   ``He had a heart attack a few years back and bronchial problems,
and I guess it just all caught up with him.''
   Schaefer called Evans ``one of the last great actor-managers.''
   ``Teahouse of the August Moon'' earned Evans a Tony Award in 1954.
   ``No Time for Sergeants,'' the story of a hillbilly draftee who
nearly brings the Army to its knees, made actor Andy Griffith a star.
   Evans was born in Dorchester. His theater career began at age 7
and his father _ a druggist, justice of the peace and amateur actor
_ cast him in adaptations of Thomas Hardy novels.
   His big breakthrough came in ``Journey's End'' in 1929, and he
became one of London's most sought-after stage actors. But he
continued to run a dry-cleaning business during the day, once
saying, ``I have no intentions of winding up starving in an attic.''
   He joined the Old Vic Theater in 1934 and portrayed such
classical Shakespearean roles as Hamlet, Caesar and Petruchio. He
also favored Bernard Shaw plays, performing in ``Saint Joan'' and
``Major Barbara.''
   With his smooth, baritone voice, he was lured to Broadway in 1935
for ``Romeo and Juliet.''
   He became an American citizen in 1941 and entered the Army in
1942, staging about 60 plays for U.S. troops, including a popular
shortened version of ``Hamlet'' that became known as ``G.I. Hamlet.''
   He rose to the rank of major and headed the Army Entertainment
Section in the central Pacific in World War II.
   After the war, he returned to Broadway, becoming a critical
success and a millionaire. He had been in semi-retirement for the
past 10 years.
   Evans had no immediate survivors. Funeral services were to be
held Wednesday at a local crematorium.

<HEAD>Actor's Ex-lover Files Second Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rock Hudson's former homosexual companion has
filed a new lawsuit against representatives of the late actor's
estate charging they made false claims against him.
   The new $7.1 million suit was filed Monday in Superior Court on
behalf of Marc Christian, who was awarded $21.7 million from the
estate in an emotional distress suit last month. In that civil case,
a jury found that Hudson and his personal secretary, Mark Miller,
conspired to keep Christian from learning Hudson had AIDS.
   Attorneys for Hudson's estate and Miller have said they will seek
a new trial.
   The new lawsuit alleged that estate representatives knowingly
made false claims in a cross-complaint to force Christian to abandon
his earlier legal action or settle it.
   The cross-complaint, filed in February 1986 but dismissed before
the trial, alleged that Christian had sex with men and women for
money, had threatened to publish Hudson's love letters to him, had
forced the actor to let Christian live in his house and took about
$60,000 worth of the actor's property.
   Miller was named in the new complaint along with three attorneys
and Wallace Sheft, the estate's executor. The suit seeks $1 million
in general damages and $6.1 million in punitive damages.
   Harold Rhoden, Christian's attorney, could not be reached for
comment Monday night.
   Christian has tested negative for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, but contended he suffered emotional distress after
learning that Hudson had AIDS. The actor died from AIDS-related
complications on Oct. 2, 1985.

<TEXT>
   Guns 'n Roses, one of the country's hottest heavy
metal bands, has been dropped as a headliner at an AIDS benefit
concert because of anti-gay lyrics on some of their songs, the
event's sponsor said.
   Officials at Gay Men's Health Crisis, which is sponsoring the
June 8 ``Rock and a Hard Place'' benefit at Radio City Music Hall,
are searching for another name act to save the concert.
   ``We acknowledge that Guns 'n Roses was the first act to step
forward for `Rock and a Hard Place' and we thank them for their
offer,'' GMHC said in a statement. ``However, after accepting their
offer, the lyrics of several of the cuts on their current album came
to our attention.''
   The statement said the invitation was withdrawn ``on the basis of
the songs' misinformation about AIDS.''
   Among the songs deemed objectionable was ``One in a Million,''
which uses a degrading term for homosexuals and implies they spread
disease.
   Geffen Records, whose chairman David Geffen is one of the vice
chairmen of the benefit, said, ``Guns 'n Roses still wish GMHC every
success with the event.''

<HEAD>Indian Bureau Freezes Trust Funds in Navajo Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has frozen funds
belonging to the Navajos to prod the tribe into resolving a dispute
over the status of embattled chairman Peter MacDonald.
   James Stevens, Navajo Area director for the U.S. Bureau of Indian
Affairs, said the freeze, announced Monday, does not involve such
basic services as welfare and law enforcement and is expected to
have little immediate impact.
   Rather, Stevens said, he intended to ``put the tribe on notice''
that it must settle the dispute over MacDonald.
   He declined to say how much money was involved.
   The Tribal Council voted Feb. 17 to place MacDonald on paid leave
in the wake of corruption allegations aired during U.S. Senate
hearings. MacDonald has denied an wrongdoing and has contested the
legality of that move.
   Stevens said the freeze applies to funds in trust from such
sources as timber, coal and oil leases. The Navajos periodically
draw on the funds, mostly for tribal administrative costs, he said.
   ``We're of the position that legally we cannot say that one has
the authority to sign or the other group. And we can't make that
determination,'' he said.
   ``I agree that the BIA should stay out of politics,'' MacDonald
said in a statement.
   The Navajos are the nation's largest Indian tribe. About 150,000
of its 200,000 members live on the reservation, which is in Arizona,
New Mexico and Utah.

   Authorities today sought an intruder
who used weed killer to write the words ``we were here'' on the lawn
of former Prime Minister Edward Heath's home, police said.
   The intruder slipped past a police guard at the front gate of
Heath's 14th century mansion on property surrounding Salisbury
Cathedral, 65 miles southwest of London, police said.
   A police spokesman said the incident occurred last week while the
former Conservative Party leader was away.
   ``The house was not entered and nothing was stolen,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Heath was prime minister from 1970-74 and Conservative leader
until 1975 when he was succeeded by Margaret Thatcher, the current
prime minister.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 40 detainees held
without charge have resumed or started hunger strikes at prisons in
two cities, lawyers said today.
   All but four are being held at Westville Prison in the port city
of Durban. They had suspended a hunger strike last week but resumed
the fast Sunday because they believed the government had broken a
promise to either free them or charge them, lawyer Ebrahim Goga said.
   The National Association of Democratic Lawyers said four
detainees at Pretoria Central Prison began their hunger strike last
week. They also demand that they be freed or charged.
   There have been a series of hunger strikes since January,
involving about half the estimated 1,000 detainees held at the
beginning of the year.
   The government says about 280 detainees have been released as a
result of negotiations to end the strikes, but anti-apartheid
leaders question the figure and say all detainees should be freed.
   Severe restrictions have been imposed on many detainees released
in the past few weeks.
   Leon Mellet, a spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry, said
activists ``are trying to rekindle the hunger strike for political
and propaganda purposes.''
   ``They do not have the interests of the detainees at heart,'' he
said.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods under the 3-year-old state of emergency.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief government spokesman today defended
China's crackdown on protesters in Tibet and said authorities will
never allow the region to be independent.
   In a wide-ranging news conference, Yuan Mu also denounced dissent
within China. He said a battle to improve the economy is showing
results.
   Asked about recent campaigns by Chinese intellectuals calling for
democratic reforms and the release of political prisoners, Yuan
said, ``We are not happy with this situation.''
   China's constitution, Yuan said, guarantees freedom of speech,
``but no one is allowed to infringe upon the interests of the state,
society and other citizens.''
   He said some critics of the government, whom he did not name,
were denying the basic tenets of Marxism and rule of the Communist
Party and ``relying on foreign forces'' to spread their message.
   ``This is something we are not in favor of,'' he said. ``China
has no intention to import from Western political systems things
which are not in keeping with reality in China.''
   Yuan denied China has any political prisoners.
   China showed its displeasure with political activism by
preventing astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, the nation's best known
dissident, from attending a banquet held by President Bush during
Bush's visit last month.
   Asked about Tibet, where dozens of people have died in
anti-Chinese riots since 1987 _ including 16 people killed last week
_ Yuan said ``conflicts arise'' there because ``some separatists
want to split Tibet from the motherland, and we won't allow that.''
   ``The channel for dialogue is always open'' with Tibet's exiled
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, Yuan said.
   The Dalai Lama has agreed to talk to the Chinese, but China
rejects his proposals to give Tibet greater regional autonomy.
   Yuan said China's six-month effort to reduce an inflation rate
officially set at 26 percent has had some success, although
``further efforts will be faced with great difficulties.''
   He also said government reassertion of controls over many aspects
of the economy is not a setback for the 10-year-old policies of
market-oriented reforms.
   ``While enlivening the economy, chaos can't appear,'' he said.
``Good order must be maintained while invigorating enterprises.''
   Saving deposits are on the rise, the momentum of price rises has
leveled off since the beginning of the year and industrial growth
through February has been held to a manageable 8 percent, less than
half the overheated rate of the past year, he said.
   Yuan said further reforms in the nation's heavily subsidized
price system, deemed crucial to increased productivity and economic
efficiency, will slow this year because of the inflation problem.
   Asked if the government would meet its goal of substantially
lowering inflation this year, Yuan said it will be ``very
difficult.... That remains to be seen.''

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels trying to
sabotage Sunday's presidential election bombed a voting center and
threatened election workers.
   An armed forces communique said rebels dynamited the Central
Elections Council office in Santa Tecla, five miles west of San
Salvador. The Monday morning blast did ``considerable material
damage,'' the communique said, but no one was injured.
   A young man and woman who work in the central election center in
La Libertad province told The Associated Press on Monday that they
wouldn't leave because they needed the work. They spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   ``We all have to stay,'' the young man said. ``For necessity, to
make a living.''
   The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which has
called for a boycott of the March 19 presidential election, also
repeated its warning for vehicles to stay off roads. The rebels said
in a broadcast on their clandestine Radio Venceremos that vehicles
will be attacked beginning Thursday.
   It said election workers who don't resign will be ``considered by
our people as part of the counterinsurgency,'' making them rebel
targets.
   Traffic bans have been a frequent tactic in the guerrillas'
9-year-old war with the U.S.-backed government. They are by now a
fixture in Salvadoran elections.
   The rebels have boycotted all five elections this decade, but
their threats against election workers and the attack on the
election center were unprecedented.
   The rebels offered to take part in this year's presidential
election and accept its results if it were postponed until September
to give them time to prepare and if security and other conditions
were met. The government said it might consider a briefer delay, but
the rebels called the boycott.
   Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova said the
military had taken steps to ensure the ``security and protection of
the people from the threats of the enemies of democracy'' during the
election.
   The comment was part of his nationwide television broadcast
announcing the military was admitting responsibility for the
massacre of 10 peasants in September. Nine soldiers will be turned
over to civilian authorities for prosecution.
   The military initially blamed the slayings on guerrillas but
reversed itself after U.S. pressure and months of investigation by
journalists and civilian authorities.
   About 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have died in the
civil war.

<TEXT>
   A doctor pleaded guilty to charges he bought
blood from junkies and the poor and then billed Medicaid for $3.6
million worth of unnecessary lab tests.
   Prosecutor Edward J. Kuriansky of the attorney general's office
called the scam ``the largest and most nefarious fraud ever
perpetrated on this country's health care system.''
   Dr. Surinder Singh Panshi, 40, pleaded guilty Monday to all 127
counts against him.
   Panshi recruited junkies and the poor to sell a pint of blood for
$10. Investigators raiding apartments where the blood was given
often found lines of poor people waiting to get in, said Sonya
Hoover, a spokeswoman for Kuriansky.
   Tests on the blood then were performed in Panshi's laboratories,
where one pint could yield $2,000 in billings to Medicaid, the
federal health-care program for the poor, said Kuriansky.
   In 2{ years, the labs billed Medicaid more than $31.6 million.
Officials do not know how much of the total was legitimate.
   ``The $3.6 million is what we felt we could prove in a court of
law,'' Hoover said.
   State Supreme Court Justice Herbert A. Posner ordered the labs to
repay the $3.6 million. The judge indicated he would give Panshi a
five- to 10-year prison term at sentencing April 6 and order him to
repay $300,000.
   Officials began looking into the scam after emergency room
doctors reported that junkies were showing up with ``half their
blood supply gone,'' said Hoover.
   Panshi pleaded guilty to grand larceny, conspiracy, offering a
false instrument for filing and falsifying business records.
   His father, Gurdial Singh Panshi, is also charged in the case and
is the subject of an international manhunt.

   Mayor Teddy Kollek has been hospitalized with a

   The 77-year-old Kollek was admitted to Jerusalem's Shaarei Zedek
Hospital on Monday, city spokeswoman Tirza Frenkel said. She refused

   Hospital spokeswoman Deborah Weissman said the mayor ``will
undergo a series of tests and will stay at the hospital for several
days.'' She said Kollek asked that the hospital not disclose details
about his medical condition.
   The daily Hadashot said Kollek's illness was not considered
serious but has caused the mayor severe pain. The Jerusalem Post
said the mayor has an excellent health record and that the only
other time he was hospitalized in recent years was for cataract
surgery.
   The Vienna-born Kollek has been mayor of Jerusalem since 1965.
Last month he won re-election to a sixth term in office, but his One
Jerusalem party lost its majority on the city council. Kollek has
worked to unify the city's residents since Israel annexed Arab east
Jerusalem in 1967.

<HEAD>Amnesty Says Cambodia Still Holds Hundreds of Political Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International today urged Cambodia to
furnish information about hundreds of political prisoners the human
rights group says remain jailed despite an amnesty proclaimed last
May.
   Amnesty said it has names of more than 400 people, including some
prisoners arrested as long ago as 1979 who have yet to be charged or
tried, and others who may have died in jail.
   ``Amnesty International asks for an independent and impartial
investigation into the deaths of these prisoners,'' the London-based
organization said in a statement issued by its French section.
   It said the Cambodian Council of State declared an amnesty for
political prisoners in May 1988, but ``it is difficult to see who
benefited from it. What's more, sentences have been prolonged for
prisoners refusing to `repent.'''
   Amnesty said 412 people were arrested in the first nine months of
1988, all considered ``hidden enemy elements.''
   ``In the course of recent years, Amnesty International has made
known on numerous occasions its preoccupation with the allegations
of torture and the detention of numerous political prisoners (in
Cambodia),'' Amnesty said. ``In June 1987, the organization
published a report on this subject. The Cambodia government has

   Seven state corrections officials face
disciplinary hearings for their roles in approving an eight-hour
pass for an inmate who allagedly murdered his ex-wife while he was
out of prison.
   Gov. Evan Bayh announced the proceedings Monday as he received an
internal report that showed officials knew that Alan L. Matheney
harbored ill will toward his ex-wife and that she had expressed fear
over any plan to release him.
   Matheney, 38, is charged in the March 3 beating death of Lisa
Marie Bianco, 29, outside her home in Mishawaka.
   Among those facing hearings, which could begin this week, are the
superintendent of the Correctional Industrial Complex at Pendleton,
where Matheney was serving an eight-year sentence for beating Ms.
Bianco and confining their children in 1987.
   ``He had no business being part of the (furlough) program,'' said
Bayh, who has suspended the program pending review by new correction
Commissioner James E. Aiken.
   The report by Board of Correction Chairwoman Virginia Dill
McCarty said officials had denied Matheney's requests for passes six
times. Bayh and McCarty also said officials should have notified the
prosecutor's office or Bianco of the pass.
   A prison counselor, replying to a letter from Bianco, had written
the woman in January to say she would be notified before Matheney's
release, the report said.
   ``We have a questionable program, implemented poorly, compounded
by human error,'' Bayh said.
   Aiken, serving his first day on the job Monday, said it is
impossible to say that the slaying could have been prevented even if
the program had been administered more strictly.
   Bayh said the seven correction officials, two of whom were
suspended last week, could receive punishments ranging from verbal
reprimands to dismissal.
   Those scheduled for hearings also include the director of the
division of adult institutions and two assistant superintendents.
   McCarty said prison officials first behaved well in response to
Matheney's requests for passes but ``as time passed, the combination
of lack of clear lines of authority, lack of procedures, perhaps CIC
personnel's lack of training in special assignment procedures and
human error caused the system to fail.''

<HEAD>Texas Bill Would Ban Kids Under 12 From Back of Pickups</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Riding in the back of a pickup is a Texas
way of life that's got to go, a legislator says.
   A bill that would prohibit children under 12 from riding in the
back of a pickup passed the Senate in a voice vote Monday and was
sent to the House.
   Thirty people, seven under 12, were killed riding in the back of
pickups in Texas last year, said the bill's sponsor, Sen. Carl
Parker.
   ``I saw some article where it quoted somebody as saying that
riding in the back of a pickup was a Texas way of life,'' Parker
said. ``Well, I submit to you this is one area where Texas leads the
nation and, in fact, it is a Texas way of death, and it's time to
put a stop to it.''
   Parker's bill would make it a misdemeanor to carry a child in the
back of a pickup on a public road at more than 15 mph. Fines range
from $25 to $200.

   Three bombs exploded simultaneously today
in a northeastern Indian town, killing at least 17 people, and state
officials said separatist tribal militants were responsible for the
attacks.
   Police said at least 48 people were injured by the blasts in the
town of Bongaigaon in Assam state.
   Police said two bombs went off in a crowded marketplace and a
third occurred near a railroad crossing.
   Unofficial sources said the death toll could be at least 20.
   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the bombs were planted by Bodo tribespeople who are demanding a
separate homeland on the northern bank of the Brahmaputra River in
Assam, a remote and hilly state bordering Bangladesh and Bhutan.
   The bombings were the most serious attacks attributed to the
Bodos since they began their separatist campaign in 1987, claiming
discrimination by other settlers of the area.
   Today's deaths raise to 99 the number of people reported killed
by Bodo militants. At least 44 of the victims have been killed since
Feb. 8.
   Many people have fled Bodo-dominated regions, fearing more
violence, police said.
   The Bodo Students Union has called for a 15-day statewide general
strike starting Wednesday in support of its demand for a separate
state, which would cover about one-third of Assam, mostly prime
forest and cultivable land.
   The Bodos claim migration to their traditional homeland by
non-tribals has caused economic and social repression. The problem
has been simmering for more than 20 years, but there were few
reports of violence until about two years ago.
   The Bodos were animists before they converted earlier this
century to Hinduism and Christianity.

<HEAD>Havel Appeal Set; Other Dissidents Face Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czech playwright and activist Vaclav
Havel, imprisoned after being convicted of taking part in a protest,
will get an appeal hearing on March 21, his brother said today.
   Ivan Havel, speaking by telephone from Prague, said the
prosecution also has appealed for a longer sentence and a fine for
his brother.
   The playwright filed an appeal seeking to overturn the conviction
immediately after a Prague court sentenced him Feb. 21 to nine
months in jail on charges of incitement and obstructing a police
officer.
   The charges arose from an unprecedented week of public protest in
Prague in January. The protests marked the 20th anniversary of the
death of Czech student Jan Palach, who set himself on fire in 1969
to protest the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Havel's jailing provoked strong protests from several Western
nations and even from the East bloc, where Polish Premier Mieczyslaw
Rakowski attended a Warsaw premiere of two Havel plays _ both banned
in Czechoslovakia _ the weekend after the Prague trial.
   The sentencing was part of a communist crackdown on dissent that
resulted in the jailing of two more activists last week and led to
fines, jail terms or suspended sentences for seven other dissidents.
   The London-based emigre publishing house Palach Press said Monday
that two leaders of the Independent Peace Association who were
arrested in October will be tried in Prague on Thursday on charges
of incitement. If convicted, they could be jailed for up to five
years.
   Hana Marvanova and Tomas Dvorak have been charged with incitement
on grounds of addressing a crowd at an Aug. 21 rally in Prague that
turned into a demonstration by about 10,000 people protesting the
Soviet-led invasion of 1968 that crushed communist reforms.
   The two face an additional charge of preparing to incite in
connection with an Oct. 28 demonstration to mark the 70th
anniversary of Czechoslovakia's pre-World War II independence,
Palach Press said.
   Also, it said, a Brno cultural activist, Eva Vidlarova, will be
tried March 23 on charges she organized a petition for another
jailed cultural activist.

<TEXT>
   One man died today as fire gutted the top two
floors of a 27-story building housing the government's radio and
television services. It was the second blaze in less than a year to
hit the Cairo landmark on the banks of the Nile.
   Officials in the building and witnesses said the fire started at
7:15 a.m. and was under control two hours later. It was restricted
to the top floors and roof, which holds a transmitting tower.
   Immediately after the blaze was extinguished, Cairo governor
Youssef Sabry Abu-Taleb said it caused no casualties. But police
sources reported later that firefighters searching the ruins found a
man's charred body on the 27th floor. They identified it as that of
Wasfi Zaki Abdel-Malaak, a night watchman.
   Two firefighters and five employees in the building were treated
for smoke inhalation, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Official Radio Cairo broadcast a government statement saying ``a
malfunction in a subsidiary electric connection, far away from the
main cables powering radio transmissions'' caused the fire.
   Interior Minister Zaki Badr, who was at the scene, said the fire
was being investigated. He ruled out sabotage.
   The two top floors of the 29-year-old building contain
administrative offices and were believed to have been unoccupied
when the fire began. The work day for radio and television
administrative employees normally begins after 8 a.m.
   About two dozen fire engines rushed to the scene, where flames
poured out of the two floors and licked at the bottom of the roof.
But the first ladders only went up the side of the building an hour
after the fire began.
   Two military helicopters circled above, and river police provided
special boats to supply additional water for firefighters.
   An electrical short circuit caused a smoky fire on the eighth
floor of the building last April, and 40 people were treated for
smoke inhalation.
   The building houses about 6,000 people at peak working hours _
employees of state radio and television, broadcast artists and the
staff of the Information Ministry that controls them. Several
hundred people probably were in the building at the time of the
fire, most of them in the first nine floors, officials said.

   The government will halt imports of fruit from Chile
because of threats of cyanide contamination, Japanese news reports
said today.
   An anonymous caller telephoned the Japanese Embassy in Santiago,
Chile, last week and claimed to have put cyanide in fruit exported
to Japan, reports by the NHK television network and Kyodo News
Service quoted Foreign Ministry officials as saying.
   Ministry officials responsible for Latin American affairs did not
answer telephone calls late today.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday warned consumers
not to eat any fruit imported from Chile after traces of cyanide
were found in Chilean seedless red grapes in Philadelphia. The U.S.
Embassy in Chile had also received a telephone call saying Chilean
fruits were contaminated.
   Japanese authorities will inspect all Chilean fruit on sale in
Japan and warn consumers not to eat fruit from the South American
nation, NHK said.

   A 61-year-old quarry worker who was trapped

amputated his legs to free him from the machine, hospital officials
said.
   After his legs were severed at mid-thigh, Clinton Tyler, an

helicopter to Shands Teaching Hospital in Gainesville, where he
underwent four hours of surgery, said Sgt. Ken Ergle of the Marion

   Tyler died at 4:40 a.m., said hospital spokesman Chris Smith.
   Tyler, of Zuber, was extracting flintrock from the crusher Monday
evening when the accident occurred, Ergle said.
   Tyler told his rescuers he switched the gears to neutral and
climbed inside to correct a malfunction when the machine kicked into
gear, Ergle said. A co-worker quickly turned off the machine but
Tyler's legs were crushed.

   Bartenders mixed Singapore Slings by the dozen
today as visitors savored a last taste of the old Orient before
Raffles Hotel closed for a two-year renovation.
   The hotel, established in 1886, was the social center for the
grand and the beautiful when this Southeast Asian island was a
British colony. The Raffles' guests once included such writers as
Somerset Maugham, Rudyard Kipling and Joseph Conrad.
   Maugham said Raffles ``stands for all the fables of the exotic
East.'' Kipling advised eating there but sleeping elsewhere; he said
the beds were uncomfortable.
   Visitors today thronged the hotel's bar, where the Singapore
Sling was invented 74 years ago. Others wandered around the
ground-floor lobbies and shops where sad-faced staff sold T-shirts,
coffee mugs and other souvenirs of Raffles' final hours.
   The 127-room hotel was to close at midnight for renovation of the
building and construction of an extension at a cost of $78 million.
   It is to reopen in 1991 as a luxury hotel to compete with the
skyscraper hotels that have opened in recent years. Renovators also
plan to retain Raffles' old-world features.
   The hotel owner, DBS Land Ltd., is an arm of Development Bank
Singapore, of which the Singapore government owns a majority.
   The three-story hotel is named after Sir Stamford Raffles, a 19th
century British official of the East India Co. He is regarded as the
founder of colonial Singapore.
   During the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945, the hotel is
reputed to have been the center of the Japanese secret police, the
Kempeitai.
   British colonial officials returned after the war to patronize
Raffles. After Singapore became independent in 1965, the hotel still
had a magnetic draw for those who wanted to taste the Orient.
   The posh new hotels in the city offer much more comfort and
service, but lack the charm of Raffles, which relies on high
ceilings and whirring fans to dispel Singapore's equatorial heat.
   Air conditioning was installed in the guest rooms some years ago,
``but it threw out all the atmosphere,'' recalled Mike Gallagher of
Darwin, Australia, who first stayed at Raffles in 1968.
   ``This is a trip down nostalgia lane for me,'' Gallagher said as
he sipped a $9 Singapore Sling in the Long Bar, where some of the
atmosphere is provided by sparrows that flit in through the verandas.

<HEAD>Prisoner Planned Murder-For-Hire `Bloodbath,' Prosecutor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inmate hatched at least a dozen
murder-for-hire plots from his cell, and the intended victims
included a federal judge, a state appeals court justice, witnesses
and a reporter, a newspaper reported today.
   Kevin James Veschi, serving a life term in a maximum-security
prison, planned a ``bloodbath of maniacal proportions,'' said Bexar
County First Assistant District Attorney Jamie Boyd.
   The district attorney's office named the 12 intended victims and
six possible conspirators in an affidavit submitted to obtain a
warrant to search Veschi's cell Monday, Boyd said.
   The San Antonio Express-News reported that the intended victims
included Boyd, another prosecutor and a reporter for the newspaper,
John Moulder, who broke the story about Veschi's criminal activities
in 1987.
   Veschi later was convicted of attempted capital murder,
aggravated robbery and burglary. Prosecutors said he operated a
criminal organization that was involved in daylight burglaries, auto
thefts and threats.
   The newspaper reported that it delayed by two days its account of
the death plots to avoid interfering with an undercover part of the
investigation.
   In New Jersey, an agent, posing as a hit man and a friend of
Veschi's, met on Monday with a woman who wanted her husband killed,
said the affidavit. The woman offered to pay $5,000 to Veschi and
$5,000 to the killer, it said.
   The newspaper said officials in New Jersey were preparing charges
against the woman, whose identity was not disclosed.
   Other intended victims, according to the newspaper, were U.S.
District Judge H.F. ``Hippo'' Garcia; an appellate judge, three
lawyers who represented Veschi; a former prosecutor; a burglar who
testified against Veschi, and a woman who was to be killed in a life
insurance scheme.
   Boyd said the targets were notified, and federal marshals, the
FBI and the Texas Rangers were called to help provide protection.
   Authorities said that when officers at the state prison at
Rosharon went to search his cell, Veschi had to be dragged out,
cursing and screaming. Letters, photos and other papers were taken
from Veschi's cell, Boyd said.
   The affidavit said that a prison neighbor of Veschi's, murderer
John Marco Civella, 33, was a prospective hit man in the scheme.
   Civella, due to be released later this year, said Veschi promised
him guns, rental cars, ``safe houses,'' cocaine and an immediate
$10,000, the newspaper reported.
   Civella, discussing Veschi, told the San Antonio reporter: ``He's
got that kingpin mentality where he thinks he's a (obscenity) Al
Capone.''

   The government has promised to protect
Chilean fruit from further contamination and is blaming terrorists
and communists for a cyanide scare that threatens one of the
country's most lucrative exports.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday warned consumers
not to eat any fruit imported from Chile after traces of cyanide
were found in Chilean seedless red grapes in Philadelphia.
   The cyanide was discovered after an anonymous threat to poison
Chilean fruit was telephoned to the U.S. Embassy in Santiago on
March 2.
   News reports in Japan said today the Japanese Embassy in Santiago
had received a similar call warning of cyanide poisoning. The
reports said Japan will halt Chilean fruit imports.
   Chile's interior minister, Carlos Caceres, went on national radio
and television Monday night and blamed ``terrorism supported by
international communism which does not hesitate in damaging not only
our economic interests but also our social and moral interests.''
   Chile has been under right-wing military rule since September
1973, when the armed forced ousted the elected government of Marxist
President Salvador Allende. The coup was led by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, the current president.
   Despite the cyanide scare, Caceres said Chile ``will continue to
be a dependable supplier'' to the international fruit market.
   Security has been reinforced throughout the fruit-exporting
process ``from the crop to the port of destiny,'' he said.
   Caceres said an investigation conducted after the anonymous
caller said some export fruits would be laced with poison had
uncovered no problem.
   ``We have now come from the anonymous threat to the concrete
damage,'' he added.
   Four days after the poisoning threat was made, the FDA said the
call was ``almost certainly a hoax,'' but that it would continue to
examine samples of Chilean fruit.
   After later confirming cyanide in the Philadelphia samples, the
FDA urged that all Chilean fruit be removed from U.S. markets and
that shipments of Chilean fruits which had not yet been distributed
should be held for testing.
   ``This may be an isolated incident, but we can hardly take that
chance,'' FDA Commissioner Frank Young said Monday.
   Hours later, Canadian officials urged stores in Canada to remove
all Chilean produce.
   Health Minister Perrin Beatty asked stores to remove Chilean
produce from their shelves and advised Canadians to throw away any
fruit and vegetables they know came from Chile or think may have
come from there.
   Joe Pusateri, owner of Pusateri's supermarket in downtown
Toronto, said if he takes Chilean produce off his shelves, he won't
have anything left to sell.
   ``All my grapes, peaches, nectarines and apples come from
Chile,'' Pusateri said. ``If they're no good, what am I going to do
_ throw them in the garbage?''
   All Chilean fruit imported into Canada passes through the United
States.
   Caceres said government supervisors have been placed at every
stage of Chile's fruit-exporting process and the government is
working in cooperation with private exporters.
   He also said technicians from the Agriculture Ministry and other
agencies conducted tests Monday on a variety of fruits ready for
export and found nothing wrong.
   Caceres said the government is doing ``everything possible to
limit this unprecedented damage to the nation'' that has affected
thousands of Chilean families.
   Chile's fruit exports have been booming in recent years and it
has now become the leading importer of fresh fruit to North America
during the Northern Hemisphere's winter.
   Central Bank figures showed in 1988 that those exports reached
$584.1 million _ more than 25 percent of country's trade surpus for
last year.
   Chile's main fruit exports are grapes, melons, apples and
peaches. Imports of Chilean apples to the United States went from
16,258 tons in 1983 to 47,322 tons in 1987.

   Swedish clergymen marched through the
city today demanding higher wages and shorter working hours in what
was believed to be the first such protest in the 400-year history of
the state church.
   ``I think God is smiling in heaven,'' said the Rev. Kerstin
Propper, an assistant vicar and official of the clergymen's union.
   ``This is good for the church. The church needs it,'' she told a
radio reporter who asked what God might think of the demonstration.
   Police said there were about 150 demonstrators, some carrying
banners. One said: ``Salary according to performance.''
   ``This is a big step. Priests have never raised their voices
before. We have suffered in silence, now we have reached the
threshold of pain,'' said Ms. Propper.
   The Lutheran priests, wearing traditional black vestments and
clerical collars, marched through central Stockholm to the Office of
State Employment. Priests of the Swedish Lutheran Church are civil
servants paid by the goverment.
   The clergymen's union says real wages have dropped 40 percent
since 1970 because of inflation and that many clergymen are burdened
by debts following extensive studies of theology. They also have
complained about working overtime without compensation.
   The starting monthly salary for a priest is about $1,325. Ms.
Propper said her salary was $2,040 a month after working 18 years as
a priest. The average Swedish blue-collar worker earns about $1,412
a month.
   Our employer ``says that we should be idealistic. That is old
fashioned thinking,'' Ms. Propper said.

   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, accusing
the Palestine Liberation Organization of ``the worst atrocities
we've ever seen since World War II,'' said today his government
shares the U.S. desire for peace in the Middle East but must cope
with dangerous radicalism.
   Arens, who is to meet today with members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said on ``CBS This Morning'' that the PLO is
trying to impose itself in the area and is scaring King Hussein of
Jordan away from the peace table.
   But he said on NBC's ``Today'' show that a suggestion by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III that Israel and the PLO
consider reciprocal gestures to reduce tensions on the West Bank and
in Gaza ``is something that needs to be investigated.''
   Arens said Israel was in the midst of selecting areas in the
occupied territories where troops could be reduced. ``I think we
will see, and I can report back to you, as to whether the results
are positive or not.'' he said.
   On Monday, Arens told President Bush and Baker that U.S. talks
with the PLO would not contribute to peace-making efforts in the
Middle East.
   He said on the CBS show today that the PLO was an umbrella
organization for 10 to 12 different terrorist groups. ``They've
carried out the worst atrocities we've ever seen since World War
II,'' Arens said. ``They are trying to impose themselves on the
area. They are scaring Hussein away from the peace table. They tried
to overthrow his regime...in September of 1970. They're carrying out
terrorist activities.''
   Arens added, ``This kind of violence will not be conducive to the
peace process at all.''
   Arens called attention to the bombing last week in San Diego of
the car driven by the wife of Capt. Will Rogers, who commands the
guided missile frigate Vincennes which accidentally shot down an
Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf.
   ``You've seen the gutted car of the skipper of the Vincennes,''
Arens said on NBC. ``We see that on Israeli television every day.
We've had 1,500 cases like that this past year, people burned alive.
Dealing with that kind of terrorism is not an easy thing, and I
don't know that anybody really has a prescription on how to do it.
   ``I think the important thing is to demonstrate that this kind of
violence is not going to pay off,'' Arens said.
   But the Bush administration intends to push ahead in dealing with
the PLO, and is making plans for a sixth session with a PLO
representative next week in Tunisia.
   The talks were opened in December over Israel's objections. Since
then Palestinian guerrillas have clashed several times with Israeli
soldiers in southern Lebanon. While criticizing the PLO, Secretary
of State James A. Baker III has concluded the attacks do not
constitute terrorism.
   Arens found himself in basic agreement with President Bush and
Baker that there is an urgent need for peace-making in the Middle
East.
   Arens said they had also concluded that King Hussein of Jordan
was the ``key element'' in the process and a way must be found to
get him involved.
   But Arens told Israeli reporters after the talks on Monday that
he made the point the PLO was still engaged in terrorism on three
levels.
   He said Yasser Arafat's organization had sent guerrillas on
several infiltration raids, called for violence on the Israeli-held
West Bank and in Gaza, and threatened Palestinian Arabs who
disagreed with the PLO.
   ``There is a sense of urgency here, and even more so in Israel,''
Arens said of the need for a Mideast settlement. ``I told the
secretary and the president that since we are confronted with this
difficulty in promoting peace because so many elements are not
interested in peace it is very important we work together.''
   A senior U.S. official said, meanwhile, that Baker told Arens he
considered the situation in the territories ``untenable'' and wanted
Israel to suggest ways to reduce tensions with the predominantly
Palestinian Arab population.
   ``The object is to calm the environment, not as an end in itself
but to create conditions that will allow direct talks,'' said the
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza have been in
rebellion against Israeli control for 15 months. Amid the violence
396 Arabs and 17 Israelis have died.
   ``We certainly want to reduce tension,'' Arens told reporters at
the State Department. He added: ``It's not easy to do that
considering the violence in the area at the present time.''
   However, Arens also said: ``I think we will find common ground on
how to do this.''
   ``We didn't arrive at any finalized or defined positions,'' Arens
said. ``I think it is probably premature to expect that at this
point.''
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the
administration was seeking ``new ideas'' to advance the peace
process.
   ``President Bush emphasized that the United States does not want
to miss an opportunity for peace in the Middle East and still
believes in direct talks as the best path to peace,'' Fitzwater said
in a statement.
   Baker said he was seeking ``various reinforcing and reciprocal
steps which might be taken to defuse the tension there'' on the West
Bank and Gaza. He was not specific. But even before Arens' arrival
on Sunday, published reports said they included release of
Palestinian prisoners and a general easing of Israeli control.
   Next week, Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia,
is expected to ask the Palestine Liberation Organization to block
guerrillas from trying to infiltrate Israel.

   An earthquake blamed on a mining blast jolted the
border area between the two Germanies for 12 seconds, damaging
hundreds of homes, destroying a church and injuring six people, an
East German report said today.
   ``I had the feeling that everything was falling apart,'' the
official ADN news agency quoted Herbert Hermann, mayor of the East
German border town of Bad Salzungen, as saying.
   ``I watched as cracks formed on my walls and plaster fell from
the ceiling. All I could think of was opening a window and getting
out of there.''
   There were no reports of deaths from the Monday afternoon quake.
West German seismologists said the tremor measured 5.7 on the
Richter scale. East German reports put the magnitude at 5.5.
   ADN, in a report from Bad Salzungen, said the quake badly damaged
about 200 houses and ruined others in the nearby town of
Voelkershausen, six miles from the West German border.
   ``Residents were evacuated from 15 homes that are no longer
inhabitable and were taken in by neighbors and relatives,'' ADN said
of the situation in Voelkershausen.
   The town's church, more than 100 years old, was one of the most
severely damaged buildings, ADN reported, calling the structure a
``portrait of devastation.''
   According to ADN, the quake followed a cave-in and shifting of
underground rock formations caused by blasting in a potash mine in
Merkers, about six miles west of Bad Salzungen.
   Six people were injured, including some struck by falling chimney
bricks, ADN said. No one was in the mine was hurt.
   The quake knocked out electricity and water services and badly
damaged 80 percent of the homes in Voelkershausen, a town of 1,350
residents, ADN reported.
   ADN said that ``only dim candlelight behind windowpanes
illuminated homes that were enveloped in dark Monday night.''
   Voelkershausen deputy school director Werner Meyer said children
were in class when the earthquake struck and were quickly evacuated
by teachers.
   ``Many children are suffering from slight shock effects, but they
are all healthy,'' ADN quoted Meyer as saying.
   The tremor was felt on both sides of the border and as far away
as Switzerland and Czechoslovakia, but East Germany appeared to bear
the brunt of it.
   ADN said the quake was centered on East German territory near the
mine.
   West German authorities placed the epicenter between the West
German towns of Kassel and Bad Hersfeld.
   Horst Diehl, a Fire Department official in Bad Hersfeld, said
there was slight damage to a few buildings in the area but that he
had heard of no casualties. Bad Hersfeld is 37 miles southeast of
Kassel.
   Bruce Presgrave of the U.S. Geological Survey in Boulder, Colo.,
said his office received reports the quake may have originated in a
rockburst, which occurs when rocks under pressure suddenly fail.
Such events often happen in mining areas.

   Wind whipped grassfires for miles from Big Bend
National Park in southwestern Texas to the Louisiana border,
prompting a statewide fire alert.
   The fires have burned 44,000 acres since Saturday, killing a
dozen cattle and destroying or damaging nearly a dozen homes but
causing no deaths, authorities said. A fire chief was hospitalized
briefly after being overcome by smoke.
   Officials declared the fire alert on Monday, meaning that
conditions are dry and windy, with plentiful dry grass, timber and
dead vegetation that could fuel wildfires. Officials were
considering a ban on outdoor burning.
   Authorities blamed open burning for at least one fire and said a
cigarette started another.
   The alert remains in effect until rain lessens the fire threat.
But forecasters said no rain is expected for days.
   ``March, with its traditional high winds and low humidities and
cured fuels, is always our potentially most hazardous fire period of
the year,'' said Bruce Miles, director of the Texas Forest Service.
   Fires blackened 38,000 acres in Dickens County in the lower
Panhandle before being put out Monday around daybreak and burned
1,000 acres on the Camp Swift military reservation, 40 miles from
Austin. The fire was under control by midday Monday.
   Flames also scorched 615 acres of the High Chisos Mountains in
the worst fire in Big Bend National Park's history, and drained
firefighters in Odessa and Ector counties, who battled 36 blazes,
including one that covered 640 acres.
   A total of 151 other wildfires burned more than 3,500 acres in
the Southeastern Piney Woods through Sunday, the forest service said.

<TEXT>
   Christian soldiers and Moslem militiamen
turned the Lebanese capital into a battlefield today with fierce
shelling that shattered neighborhoods and paralyzed the port and
airport. Police said 33 people died and 93 were injured.
   All the casualties were civilians except three soldiers killed
and three wounded.
   The duels caught Beirut at the peak of the morning rush hour and
raged past midday. Cars burned in the rain-drenched streets.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules,
said most casualties occurred in Moslem west Beirut. It was the
first time in nearly a week of fighting that residential
neighborhoods have come under sustained artillery bombardment.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem Cabinet in
Lebanon's dual government, called for a speedy end to ``this
shameful massacre, this new cycle of mad violence.''
   Today's casualities raised the overall toll in the latest
violence to 39 dead and 125 injured, by police count.
   The new round of fighting in the 14-year civil war began
Wednesday after the army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, who also heads
the Christian Cabinet, began enforcing an air and sea blockade aimed
at illegal harbors operated by Moslem and Christian militias.
   The militias use the ports to bring in arms, supplies and
imported goods sold in the areas they control.
   The Christian Cabinet said shells and rockets from the Moslem
side were falling around the Defense Ministry in suburban Yarze
northeast of Beirut and around the hilltop presidential palace in
neighboring Baabda.
   Clouds of black smoke billowed over the capital as horn-honking
motorists raced out of stricken neighborhoods and gunmen shot in the
air to clear paths for ambulances.
   Schools sent students home and shopkeepers lowered their shutters
throughout the capital. Radio stations broadcast warnings to the
public to remain indoors.
   ``It's moronic,'' said English teacher Fatima Haidar as she
closed her secondary school in west Beirut's Verdun neighborhood,
the thunder of shellfire echoing across the city. ``They are the
gardeners of violence.''
   Police said several mortar shells and rockets landed at
Christian-controlled Beirut port and the harbor of Jounieh in
Lebanon's Christian enclave, about 12 miles north of the capital.
   The bombardment of Jounieh appeared aimed at disrupting the main
shipping lane linking Lebanon's Christian heartland with the outside
world.
   Police said shells also crashed around Beirut's International
Airport, which was reopened to civil aviation on Monday after a
two-day shutdown.
   Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's national carrier, said today it
had suspended flights to and from the nation's only official air
transport facility until further notice ``because of the current
security deterioration.''
   In one west Beirut neighborhood, a howitzer salvo landed on a
crowded street, setting at least seven cars on fire. Rescuers could
be seen pulling a charred body from one car.
   Aoun's headquarters accused Syrian troops stationed in west and
south Beirut and neighboring hills of starting the duel.
   ``Beirut Port is being shelled for a third day. The bombardment
has spread to hit Jounieh as well as residential districts despite
repeated warnings to stop playing with fire,'' he said in a
communique.
   ``Warnings also were served to avoid being trapped in the
intrigues of the Syrian occupation to push the Lebanese into
fighting each other anew,'' it said.
   ``We have information that the Syrian occupiers will escalate the
bombardment to engulf all sectors and residential neighborhoods.
Therefore, we ask schools to close and people to remain indoors.''
   There was no response from the command of the 12,000 Syrian
troops stationed in Beirut's Moslem sector, or from Syrian-allied
Druse and Shiite Moslem militias.

<HEAD>Senator: Bombing Investigators Don't Expect International Link</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI seems to be backing off the theory
that the bombing of a Navy captain's van was internationally
directed terrorism because the device was a crude pipe bomb, U.S.
Sen. Pete Wilson says.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing Friday of the
van driven by Sharon Rogers, the wife of USS Vincennes Capt. Will
Rogers III.
   But because Rogers ordered the mistaken downing of an Iranian
passenger jet in July, FBI officials said he is receiving protection
as a potential target of terrorists.
   ``It is their belief a sophisticated terrorist, one who is
trained in the use of explosives for car bombings, would have done a
better job and that (Mrs. Rogers) would not have escaped,'' Wilson
said Monday.
   ``It is either someone acting independently, on their own, which
I suspect to be the case, or it was conceivable that it was an act
of state-sponsored terrorism. But most of the indications point to
the former.''
   However, New York Newsday reported today that federal sources in
Washington said the CIA is providing the FBI with intelligence in
the case. Because the CIA is forbidden by law from gathering
intelligence within the United States, the report indicated
continuing suspicion of foreign involvement.
   Wilson, a California Republican, said his information was based
primarily on news reports and a conversation with the Rogerses. The
couple remain in hiding under the protection of Naval Investigative
Service agents.
   Pentagon sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted
Monday that Buck Revell, a top FBI official, warned of the potential
terrorist threat posed by Iranian students in the United States
while testifying to Congress recently.
   Revell cited the San Diego region as one area with a high number
of Iranian students, but the sources cautioned against drawing the
inference that students were behind the incident.
   While the FBI began examining debris from the explosion, the
agency would not comment publicly on the investigation, but
newspapers quoted federal sources they did not identify regarding
theories investigators are discussing.
   Although investigators are still treating the bombing as possible
terrorism, it may have been carried out by disgruntled sailors from
Rogers' ship or one or more Iranians acting on their own, an FBI
official told the Los Angeles Times.
   ``Not any of this is being ruled out,'' he said.
   The bomb detonated as Mrs. Rogers drove to work alone. She
escaped uninjured moments before the van caught fire and burned.
   Both the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times quoted sources
as saying the bomb may have been a heat-sensitive device.
   A small piece of light wood such as balsa could have been placed
between the bomb and the van's undercarriage so that when the engine
got hot, it would ignite the wood and detonate the device, the Los
Angeles Times said.
   No sign of a detonating device was found among pipe bomb
fragments recovered; the newspaper's source said that contributes to
the theory.
   He and others also noted that the bomb detonated while Mrs.
Rogers was stopped at a traffic light.
   ``Most heat comes from an automobile transmission, when the car
is stopped and waiting in traffic, so this theory makes sense,''
another official said.

<HEAD>L.A. Teachers Vote to Authorize Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers from the nation's second-largest
school district have authorized a summer strike that could stall the
release of final grades and prevent some students from graduating,
union leaders say.
   The vote by the United Teachers of Los Angeles, taken last week
and hand-counted, was 16,264 in favor to 1,909 against, UTLA
President Wayne Johnson said Monday. Th union represents 22,000 of
the district's 32,000 teachers.
   The teachers will continue negotiations, but ``the odds are very
high ... there will be a nasty, bitter strike'' as early as June,
Johnson said.
   The teachers, working without a contract since June, have
demanded a two-year wage increase of 21 percent. Board president
Roberta Weintraub said the district had made its final offer, a 20
percent raise over three years.
   The teachers' average salary is $36,600.
   A walkout near the end of the school year could tie up grades for
the district's 594,000 students, prevent some seniors from
graduating and affect students applying to colleges, said
Superintendent Leonard Britton.
   The teachers are barred by law from striking without a previous
fact-finding period in which a neutral panel reviews the disputed
issues.
   The union's last strike, in 1970, lasted 23 days.

<HEAD>Overlapping Radio Messages May Have Caused Azores Jet Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overlapping radio messages between a
pilot and air traffic controllers probably led to a jet crash in the
Azores that killed 144 people, government investigators said today.
   The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications said
that because of the overlapping conversations, the pilot apparently
descended to 2,000 feet when he should have remained at 3,000 feet.
   The American-chartered Boeing 707, filled with Italian tourists
on their way to the Caribbean, slammed into a fog-covered mountain
on the Azores island of Santa Maria on Feb. 8. All on board died.
   According to the ministry statement, the control tower authorized
the pilot to descend to 3,000 feet. It then informed the pilot which
runway to use and asked him to renew contact when the plane was at
3,000 feet.
   At the same time the control tower was relaying its second
message, the pilot was announcing plans to drop to 2,000 feet.
   Neither side heard the other's message, the ministry concluded.
   ``The plane hit ... in a zone where flying is not permitted below
an altitude of 3,000 feet,'' the report said.
   The commission also said controllers gave the jet's crew an
atmospheric pressure reading of 1,027 millibars instead of the
correct 1,108.7 millibars. The difference in pressure readings would
mean the jet's altimeters told the pilot he was 240 feet above his
actual position.
   The plane, owned by Independent Air Corp., of Smyrna, Tenn.,
crashed into 1,936 foot Pico Alto.
   According to the statement, the commission found no evidence of
mechanical or technical failure of the plane or its equipment. The
commission's report also ruled out sabotage or other criminal
action, the statement said.

   President Bush today called homelessness ``an
affront to the American dream'' and said he wants to help get
``ragged and pathetic figures'' off the streets of the nation's
capital and urban America.
   Addressing a legislative conference of the Independent Insurance
Agents of America, Bush talked of riding in his limousine along the
Ellipse, a park just off the White House grounds, and seeing people
``on the (heating) grates.''
   ``It's a national shame,'' the president said in a speech that
touched on initiatives he proposed to a joint session of Congress on
Feb. 9.
   Bush also vowed anew to work ``shoulder-to-shoulder'' with drug
czar William Bennett to mount a new attack on drug abuse, as Bennett
prepared to meet with city officials in Washington on the capital's
surging drug-related murder rate.
   Bush told his audience at a downtown hotel that he thought the
problem of drugs in schools and on the streets would show up as the
top issue ``if I could talk to each one of you in a family setting.''
   In a 193-page report to Congress summarizing his fiscal 1990
budget proposals, Bush said his administration was ``committed to
addressing forcefully the tragedy of homelessness through public and
private action.''
   ``The homeless face difficult and sometimes seemingly
overwhelming obstacles in getting back on their feet,'' he said in
that message.
   City officials estimate there are some 8,000 to 10,000 homeless
in Washington although activists for the homeless have said they
believe the figure ranges to 15,000.
   Nationally, experts agree there are no reliable figures, although
research shows that the level of homelessness can range from 300,000
to 600,000 on any given night.
   In his speech today, Bush said ``homelessness affects a small
proportion of Americans but concerns us all.''
   `` ... You look out the window of the White House, and see the
ragged and pathetic figures huddled over the steam grates of the
Ellipse. It's an affront to the American dream,'' he said.
   In his spending blueprint for the budget year beginning Oct. 1,
Bush proposed spending $644 million to carry out the aims of the
McKinney Act, which created a program to find housing for the
homeless. He also called for a new $50 million program designed to
assist volunteers and community organizations working with the
homeless.

<HEAD>Pharmaceutical Company Confirms Viral Strains Resist Its AIDS Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pharmaceutical company today said drug-resistant
strains of the AIDS virus have been found in patients undergoing
long-term treatment with the firm's AZT drug.
   Wellcome PLC was confirming a report in today's Wall Street
Journal. The newspaper said the finding could lead some doctors to
use the Wellcome drug more selectively or in combination with other
drugs for treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   AZT is the only drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for treatment of AIDS.
   Wellcome said the resistant viral strains were found in
laboratory analyses of samples taken from AIDS patients showing
severe symptoms of the deadly disease. There were no significant
changes in the condition of these patients at the time the
drug-resistant viral strains were observed, it said.
   It said the information does not ``require alterations in patient
therapy or the conduct of continuing clinical trials'' but stressed
that the responsibility for treating those infected the AIDS virus
lies with the physician.
   The British pharmaceuticals company said reviews of the data by
its own scientists and by a panel of AIDS experts have been
submitted for publication in the U.S. journal Science.
   Wellcome shares fell 36 cents, to $7.84, with the announcement.
They then recovered to $8.13.
   Jonathan de Pass, a pharmaceutical analyst at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Ltd., said the discovery of drug-resistant HIV strains was no
major surprise, as the AIDs virus is known to be prone to rapid
mutations.
   De Pass also said he did not expect the discovery to have a major
impact on AZT sales. Because of the drug's known toxic side-effects,
doctors already were expected to prescribe AZT in progressively
lower doses and in combination with other drugs, he said.
   Didier Cowling, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute, said the
major danger to AZT sales could come if the FDA were to block any
application by Wellcome to use AZT as a treatment for so-called
asymptomatic carriers of HIV _ those who do not yet show any
symptoms of the AIDS disease.
   Wellcome is testing the possible benefits of AZT on asymptomatic
patients, and Cowling expects the first results of these tests to be
available by the end of this year.
   AIDS is caused by the HIV virus, which damages the body's immune
system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   Millions of commuters were stranded
nationwide today as public transportation shut down at the start of
a 48-hour general strike called by leftist labor groups.
   However, many Brazilians ignored the strike call and went to work.
   The subway in Sao Paulo, the nation's largest city with 10
million people, operated normally, as did a small number of
privately owned buses. But the city's public bus fleet was idled.
   In greater Sao Paulo, with a population of 15 million, more than
70 percent of the 2 million factory workers showed up at their jobs,
according to the Federation of Industries of Sao Paulo State.
   The city's suburbs are home to Brazil's foreign-owned auto plants
_ including General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen _ and a center of
strike organization.
   International and domestic airlines flew on normal schedules, and
supermarkets, gas stations, small shops and corner cafes opened.
   Brazil's two largest labor movements _ the radical left Central
Workers Union and the more moderate General Workers Central _ called
the strike to protest President Jose Sarney's anti-inflation policy,
which has frozen workers' pay since January.
   ``I would say we can consider the strike a success. I am sure
that as the day progresses the strike will grow,'' Sergio dos Santos
said in a telephone interview early today from strike headquarters
in Sao Paulo.
   Some violence was reported. In Sao Paulo, rock-throwers damaged
about 30 buses and one person was arrested, police said.
   In Rio de Janeiro, the nation's second-largest city, strikers
threw stones and punctured tires of some privately owned buses that
attempted to operate. City-owned buses did not run.
   Police with billy clubs beat and detained several people accused
of trying to loot stores in Caxias, on the northern outskirts of Rio
de Janeiro.
   A photographer of the Jornal do Brasil newspaper who was taking
pictures of the beatings was shot in the hand by a policeman,
according to the Jornal do Brasil radio station, which is owned by
the newspaper.
   Sarney's centrist government warned it would not allow violence
and accused the labor groups of trying to seize control of Latin
America's largest country.
   ``We have reliable information that violence against the freedom
to work is planned,'' Justice Minister Oscar Dias Correa told the
nation of 144 million people in a radio and television broadcast.
   Army troops were posted in Rio outside the main downtown station
of the government-run commuter railroad, which was shut down. The
trains normally carry about 1 million commuters a day.
   Rio's subway was shut down, as was the government-run commuter
ferry service across world-famous Guanabara Bay.
   In Brasilia, the capital, Labor Minister Dorothea Werneck kept in
telephone contact with authorities in Brazil's 26 states to assess
the degree of participation in the strike.
   The unions that called the strike together claim to represent 35
million of the nation's 60 million workers.
   The general strike was Brazil's third since the nation returned
to civilian rule in 1985. The first, in December 1986, was partly
successful. The second, in August 1987, was a failure.
   ``This year, the two labor movements have put aside their
rivalries and we are much better prepared,'' said Jair Meneguelli,
president of the Central Workers Union.
   At issue is a wage freeze that is part of the government's Jan.
15 ``Summer Plan,'' an austerity package that also includes a price
freeze and other measures aimed at bringing down 1,000 percent
annual inflation.
   The plan brought inflation down from a rate of 28.7 percent a
month in December to 3.6 percent for the first 11 days of February,
the latest period for which government figures are available.
   But Meneguelli said the wage freeze slashed workers' purchasing
power by up to 49 percent ``and we want it back.'' More than half of
Brazilian workers earn less than $50 a week.
   The government concedes that purchasing power dropped, but has
not given figures.
   The Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries said in a statement
that the general strike was aimed exclusively at ``the destruction
of the Summer Plan, which despite its errors was the only viable way
to stop a process of hyperinflation, which threatened to lead Brazil
to chaos.''
   The country is saddled with a $115 billion foreign debt.

   Warnings against disruptions will be
posted when a church that closed a month ago because of protests by
parishioners reopens.
   Three weeks after police were summoned to St. Michael the
Archangle Roman Catholic Church to oust dissidents protesting the
transfer of a Polish priest, the parish corporation voted Friday to
reopen the church, Edward Tulinski said Monday.
   The church will probably resume Masses by Sunday, which is Palm
Sunday, said Tulinski, one of two lay members of the five-member
board.
   ``They were eager to reopen the church for the Easter holidays,''
he said.
   On the advice of the corporation's lawyer, signs will be posted
threatening the arrest of anyone who attempts to occupy the church
or undertake any activity not authorized by the Rev. John Bambol,
the pastor, Tulinski said.
   The predominantly Polish church has been closed since Feb. 18,
when church officials called police to end a weeklong sit-in by
about 200 parishioners upset by the transfer of the Rev. Roman
Palaszewski.
   The dissidents charged that Bambol engineered Palaszewski's
ouster because he was too active in the Polish community, and they
questioned Bambol's commitment to maintaining the church's Polish
character.
   Bambol and his supporters have blamed much of the unrest on
recent immigrants from Poland and say they have the backing of 95
percent of the 1,400 families belonging to the parish.
   One dissident leader vowed to defy the order against unauthorized
activities in the church.
   ``I'll be the first to get arrested again,'' said Henry Chmiel,
one of two parshioners arrested when police marched in and ordered
the dissidents to leave.
   A few hours after the dissidents were removed, Bishop Edward Egan
announced that the church was being closed indefinitely on grounds
that the protest had made it impossible to conduct services in a
reverential manner.
   The protesters have held prayer vigils outside the church each
Sunday since.
   Monsignor Nicholas Grieco, a spokesman for the bishop, said
Palaszewksi will not be returned to the church and Bambol will not
be removed.

   A Boeing 727 carrying 124 people made an
emergency landing at a municipal airport east of Dallas today after
a warning light falsely indicated an engine fire, Delta Air Lines
said. No one was injured.
   ``There was no fire and the crew and the passengers were all
off-loaded by the aircraft chutes,'' said Federal Aviation
Administration spokeswoman Gerrie Cook in Fort Worth.
   Inspectors found a pneumatic duct leak in one engine but no sign
of fire, Ms. Cook said.
   Delta said that the landing was a precaution and that there had
been no immediate danger.
   The jet, en route from Atlanta to San Diego, landed at Majors
Field 40 miles from Dallas shortly after 9 a.m. More than an hour
later the plane remained on the runway awaiting inspection and
repair, Ms. Cook said.
   Delta chartered buses to bring the 117 passengers and crew of
seven to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport so they could make
connections to the West Coast.
   Majors Field is a two-runway municipal airport used primarily by
E-Systems Inc., a defense electronics contractor. Only one runway,
6,800 feet long, is in use.
   The former World War II Army Air Corps training field routinely
handles planes as big as 747s, which E-Systems modifies for military
and other specialized uses.

   Radio Free Europe said Tuesday its
engineers found no indication the Kremlin had resumed jamming it or
its sister station Radio Liberty to block reports on demonstrations
in the Soviet Union.
   Soviet dissidents said Monday that Radio Liberty broadcasts had
been jammed.
   Radio Liberty, a sister station of the U.S.-financed Radio Free
Europe, broadcasts to the Soviet Union, while Radio Free Europe
beams to the Baltic states and the rest of Eastern Europe. The two
stations, based in Munich, have combined management.
   Radio Free Europe spokesman Bob Redlich said there was no jamming.
   ``We have no indication of any jamming,'' Redlich said from the
station's headquarters in Munich.
   ``Our engineers checked this very closely and they could not find
any jamming anywhere. There is no jamming,'' he said.
   Redlich said an effect similar to jamming could have been caused
by increased solar activity in recent days that can hamper radio
reception.
   He said Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty monitors noticed no
incidents of jamming over the weeked.
   Dissidents in Moscow said Radio Liberty's broadcasts were jammed
to block its reports on anti-government demonstrations and
detentions in Moscow, Leningrad and two other Soviet cities.
   The Soviet Union stopped interfering with the broadcasts of Radio
Liberty and several other foreign radio stations, including West
Germany's Deutsche Welle and the Voice of Israel, on Nov. 29, 1988.

<TEXT>
   A military prosecutor has charged
nine army conscripts with plotting terrorist acts, a state newspaper
reported Tuesday.
   The newspaper Vecernje Novosti said an illegal extremist group it
identified as ``The Marxists-Leninists of Kosovo'' planned to set
fire to the main hall of a Belgrade military school and encourage
the blaze to spread to a nearby gasoline station.
   Six of those accused are ethnic Albanians and three are
sympathizers _ two Croatians and a Slovenian, the daily said.
   The group is charged with ``hostile activities and a criminal act
of terrorism.''
   Vecernje Novosti quoted the indictment as saying they carried out
``a trial diversion'' in the hall Aug. 29, causing only a small
blaze because they used cooking oil instead of gasoline.
   Yugoslavia's southern Kosovo province has been plagued by
tensions between its ethnic Albanian majority and the Serb and
Montenegrin minorities who make up about 10 percent of the
population in the economically backward region.

   Marauding gunmen killed two men and

the number killed in indiscriminate attacks in Pakistan's largest
city in six days.
   Army troops in trucks and jeeps mounted with machine guns
enforced around-the-clock curfews in several districts of Karachi
known as flashpoints for ethnic unrest.
   Police said they are uncertain what motivates the gunmen, who
fire randomly from cruising cars and motorcycles.
   Casualties have occurred among several rival ethnic groups,
according to police and hospital sources.
   Clashes, notably between native Moslems and those who immigrated
here from India, have left more than 700 people dead in the past
three years in this seaport of 9 million.
   Immigrants claim discrimination in white-collar jobs keeps them
low in the labor market. Native Pakistani groups, many of them poor,
blame the immigrants for a scarcity of blue-collar jobs.

<HEAD>Botha Returns Wednesday From Convalescence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha, at odds
with his own party, returns from an eight-week convalescence
Wednesday to confront his Cabinet ministers after they joined in
calling for a new head of state.
   By late Tuesday, Botha has made no public response to the
announcement by the National Party parliamentary caucus _ including
the entire Cabinet _ that it wanted Education Minister Frederik de
Klerk to become president.
   Botha, 73, resigned as party leader Feb. 2, two weeks after
suffering a stroke, and was succeeded in the post by de Klerk.
   The caucus has no formal means of forcing Botha out of the
presidency, barring evidence of misconduct or incapacity. But its
announcement Monday night that it wanted the party leader to be head
of state was viewed as a blunt message that Botha should drop plans
to stay in office until next year.
   The Star, the country's largest daily newspaper, referred to ``an
ominous silence'' at the presidential office in Cape Town and
predicted Botha would ``come out fighting after being cut adrift''
by his party.
   The power struggle between de Klerk and Botha reached a turning
point Sunday, when Botha arranged an interview with state TV and
announced he would not call an early election this year.
   The next election does not have to be held until March 1990, and
Botha's declaration _ made without consulting party leaders _
quashed hopes he would retire in the next few months in conjunction
with an early election.
   Beeld, an Afrikaans-language Johannesburg newspaper loyal to the
National Party, said in a biting editorial Tuesday: ``There is an
unavoidable impression that the election is being delayed as long as
possible to extend the term of the state president as long as
possible.''
   De Klerk indicated Botha should decide for himself whether to
retire, telling reporters: ``There is nothing in the (caucus)
decision that says he must step down now.''
   The Argus, Cape Town's afternoon paper, said in an editorial that
Botha had two options:
   ``He could take the undisguised hint and step down,'' the
newspaper said, or ``he could tough it out and cling to his job, as
he is constitutionally entitled to do. But he would be presiding
over a grudging caucus and Cabinet, and the results of that for
South Africa could be disastrous.''
   Botha's spokesman, Jack Viviers, said the president was expected
to report for work at 8 a.m. Wednesday. He is to preside over a
Cabinet meeting, then go to Parliament for presentation of the new
budget.
   Botha and his wife, Elize, were to have Cabinet members and other
guests at their home Tuesday night to celebrate their 46th wedding
anniversary.
   Throughout the National Party's 40 years in power, the head of
government had always been party leader. After Botha quit the party
post, party members suddenly felt free to express simmering
opposition to his authoritarian style of leadership, and to the pace
he set for racial reform.
   During 10 years as head of government, Botha has moved cautiously
to remove or amend aspects of apartheid, the system of
race-segregation that gives the white minority economic and
political control over the black majority. But Botha has held to the
underlying apartheid concept of separate racial groups, and has used
emergency powers to quell anti-apartheid uprisings in black
communities.
   De Klerk, 52, is widely seen as more open-minded and flexible
than Botha, and more in tune with a younger generation of whites who
favor early and far-reaching solutions to South Africa's social
problems.
   ``A new man ... would be forced to do new things,'' said The
Sowetan, the country's largest black daily newspaper, urging Botha
to retire.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A firefighters' union and a furniture
manaufacturers' trade association said Tuesday they have agreed to
support California's strict proposed public furniture fire
resistance test for adoption in all states.
   Adoption of the test could raise the manufacturing cost of sofas
and chairs by 20 percent but save thousands of lives by the end of
the 1990s, said the International Association of Fire Fighters and
the American Furniture Manufacturers Assocation.
   The standard would apply only to furniture used in public areas,
such as hotel lobbies, day care centers, jails and the like, and not
in hotel rooms or private homes.
   ``We had to crawl before we could walk. We want to see the effect
of this,'' said Alfred K. Whitehead, president of the union, in
explaining why the two organizations were limiting the coverage of
their proposal.
   The California standard has been proposed by that state's Bureau
of Home Furnishings but is not in effect there yet. However, some
California cities have adopted it locally.
   The test calls for placing five sheets of newspaper in a
specified open steel box on the seat of the item being tested,
igniting the paper and monitoring the test chamber to see that
temperature rise, smoke density, carbon monoxide concentration and
weight loss from the test item do not exceed specified levels for an
hour and a half.
   The aim is to delay the onset of ``flashover,'' the sudden
ignition of the entire room and the combustible gases it contains
given off by the burning item.
   Furniture passing the test ``will, at a minimum, slow the spread
of fire in these occupancies allowing firefighters to save more of
the occupants from death or injury,'' Whitehead said.
   The test is ``many times more stringent'' than current industry
standards for resistance to cigarette ignition, which accounts for
75 percent to 80 percent of furniture-related fires, said Les Flippo
of the association's Upholstered Furniture Action Council.
   ``No furniture meets it today,'' except for costly, specially
made items, said Flippo, whose association members account for 80
percent of the industry.

<HEAD>Lance Responds To FDIC Lawsuit, Says He Is Political Victim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former federal budget director Bert Lance, who
resigned amid controversy over his banking practices, says he is the
victim of an illegal and politically motivated campaign by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Lance filed his response Monday to a lawsuit filed against him
last month by the FDIC in federal court in Rome. The FDIC lawsuit
seeks $1.5 million which the agency contends Lance owes to a defunct
Tennessee bank.
   Lance charged that the FDIC, in the late 1970s, ``commenced a
policy of selectively `leaking' to the news media information about
(his) personal financial situation.'' Such information ``was
confidential and its release by the FDIC was contrary to law,'' he
said in his response.
   He asked that the lawsuit be dismissed or taken to a jury trial,
and that the FDIC be forced to pay his legal fees.
   The FDIC lawsuit, filed Feb. 8, contended Lance and his former
holding company owed the money because of renewal agreements for
loans made with United American Bank of Knoxville, Tenn.
   The Tennessee banking commissioner assumed control of United
American Bank six years ago, and the FDIC later took over various
UAB loans, including the Lance loans.
   The lawsuit listed four notes with principal balances totaling
$1,247,667 and said Lance also owed interest.
   Lance responded that he is under no obligation to pay the FDIC
anything because he had already repaid the loans. He also said the
FDIC failed to deal with him in good faith and said the renewal
agreements were forced on him by the FDIC.
   Lance, once a Calhoun banker and Georgia's transportation
commissioner, became federal budget director after fellow Georgian
Jimmy Carter was elected president in 1976. Lance resigned in
September 1977 after his banking practices were questioned.
   Three years ago, Lance agreed to pay a fine of $50,000 and not
work at any federally insured bank in a settlement resulting from
charges of bank fraud filed by the federal Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency.

   Susan St. James says she doesn't know about her
co-stars, but she won't be back next season on CBS' ``Kate &amp; Allie.''
   She has co-starred for six years with Jane Curtin as divorced
women sharing an apartment. Curtin's character, Allie, remarried
this season.
   ``My reasons for not coming back and re-signing would strictly be
that I have two small kids, as well as two older ones, and they
would kind of like to see me around,'' St. James told guest co-host
Steve Fox on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' on Tuesday.
   Everybody's contracts are up and there had been rumors that
Curtin was not likely to return. ``Jane could stay,'' St. James said
of her co-star. ``I don't know what everyone else's plans are. I
couldn't speak for them. The network hasn't even called.''
   St. James said she was happy with the ``freshness'' of the show
this season _ it added new characters _ but not with the way CBS has
bounced it around the schedule after coming in on mid-season.

<HEAD>Child Finder Hopes Lawsuit Will Open Communication with Daughter</HEAD>

   Five days before Christmas in 1974,
5-year-old Joanna Pierce went to stay with her father for what she
and her mother thought would be a weekend visit.
   Instead, her father took her to Europe, where he kept her hidden
for the next 10 years.
   Joanna's mother, Gloria Yerkovich, spent $40,000 searching for
her daughter, appeared on network television and argued with
officials from her hometown of Poughkeepsie all the way to
Washington, D.C.
   In the process, she founded Child Find Inc., an international
network that has tracked down hundreds of missing children.
Yerkovich said she started the organization as a last resort when
she couldn't break through the legal roadblocks that existed in
parental abductions _ and when her loans dried up.
   Yerkovich and her daughter were reunited in 1984 after the girl's
father, Franklin Pierce, agreed to return if a felony charge of
custodial interference against him was dropped.
   ``He did not want to subject his daughter to a life of running
any more,'' said David Cohen, Pierce's attorney.
   The homecoming didn't last long. Within a week, Joanna moved to
Florida to live with her father, with whom she remains.
   But now all three are in federal court in Albany, where Yerkovich
sued Pierce for $5.7 million, for abducting their daughter.
   Yerkovich hopes the lawsuit will help mother and daughter start
talking again, said her lawyer, Nick Lyman. ``Since 1974, she has
never had an open channel of communication with her daughter.''
   Pierce and Yerkovich were never married but he had obtained a
Family Court order granting him alternate weekend visits with his
child. Joanna vanished during the first court-ordered overnight
visit.
   Pierce, now 70, has admitted he took Joanna, but said he did so
to save her a life of torment with her mother and stepfather,
Raymond Yerkovich, an elementary school principal from Kingston whom
Gloria married in 1973.
   Joanna, testifying on behalf of her father, has said that her
mother struck her repeatedly and that her stepfather fondled her.
   The Yerkoviches have refused to respond to the charges.
   Authorities say parental abduction has increased in proportion
with the escalating rate of divorce in the United States.
   But Yerkovich said that during her search for her daughter she
was horrified to learn that while there was a national computer
network for stolen cars, there was none for missing children.
Embittered and broke, she began laying the groundwork for Child Find.
   The group compiled a pictorial directory of missing children for
distribution to schools and established a toll-free number for
people who spotted children in the directory.
   Four years later the group became the target of a state
investigation into allegations of financial irregularities and
taking kickbacks from investigators. The investigation found no
evidence to support charges of serious wrongdoing, but the agency
agreed to change promotional material and practices and offer
refunds.
   While the group helped find hundreds of missing children, Joanna
was not one of them.
   Yerkovich said Pierce, a former Dow Chemical Co. chemist who
later started his own business, was wealthy and able to move himself
and his daughter around easily.
   During testimony last week, Yerkovich burst into tears when she
recalled the evening of Dec. 20, 1974, the last day she saw Joanna
for 10 years.
   ``I cried and sometimes I screamed. I would turn on the shower
and hope the water would drown out my screams. I would scream in the
car when no one could hear me,'' she said.
   But Joanna, now 20, testified that her stepfather drank a lot and
that there was a lot of violence between her mother and stepfather.
She said she was struck almost daily and once was knocked
unconscious after being hurled against a wall.
   She also claimed her stepfather fondled her. ``He put his hands
all over my body. I despised him,'' she said.
   Joanna described an open and caring relationship with her father.
She said she never missed her mother.
   Yerkovich contends in her suit that Joanna was brainwashed by her
father and that he showed little interest in her until the abduction.
   Lyman said he'll show that Franklin Pierce took ``a loving girl
and turned her into a monster against her mother.''
   ``I saw the statements of two doctors,'' Lyman said, ``including
one hired by her father, which show she was clearly not abused. Her
life, as she knows it, is a lie.''
   Joanna tearfully disputed that.
   ``I don't want to remember, but you remember things,'' she said.

<HEAD>Seeing Eye Dog Sees Too Much in Delivery Room _ Gets Sick Twice</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A guide dog accompanied a blind
couple into a hospital delivery room but got sick twice during the
woman's labor and had to leave the room.
   But Rick Oakes and his wife, Chantal, said they wouldn't have
wanted their dog to miss the birth of their daughter, Whitney Leanne
Oakes.
   ``I like that dog better than some people I know,'' Mrs. Oakes
said Monday at their home in this Vancouver suburb. ``He's just like
part of the family.''
   Oakes said the presence of Bryor, a 3-year-old golden retriever,
allowed him to leave for meals and an occasional cigarette during
the 24 hours his wife was in labor at Vancouver's Grace Hospital on
March 8.
   He said he also wanted to make a point after having had his right
to have Bryor with him challenged by everyone from taxi drivers to
restaurant owners.
   ``I thought it would be a golden opportunity to let people know
guide dogs can go anywhere,'' he said.
   Except for two times when he had to leave the delivery room to
throw up, Bryor didn't create problems. When attention focused on
the baby after delivery, however, the dog picked up a towel and
started dragging it around the room to attract attention to himself.
   That's understandable, since everyone from doctors to orderlies
had been dropping by to give him a scratch under the collar, Mrs.
Oakes said.
   Her obstetrician, Barry Sanders, had no qualms about the dog.
   ``It was an unusual request,'' he said, ``but the dog is great.
He would never bother anybody.''

   The husband of a pregnant doctor who was slain at
Bellevue Hospital is suing the city for $25 million for negligence
in treating the mental illness of the alleged killer, an attorney
said Tuesday.
   Dr. Kathryn Hinnant-Johnson, 33, who was five months pregnant
with the couple's first child, was beaten, raped and strangled in
her fourth-floor office at Bellevue on Jan. 7.
   The alleged killer was Steven Smith, 23, a homeless man who
apparently set up a hideaway in a closet and roamed the hospital
wearing a doctor's scrub suit and lab coat and carrying a
stethoscope.
   The victim's husband, Eric A. Johnson, charged the city with
medical negligence in the treatment of Smith and negligent security
at Bellevue, said Johnson's lawyer, Thomas A. Moore.
   Moore said Smith was ``negligently and carelessly discharged''
from Bellevue after a Dec. 18-27 stay and ``not properly treated for
an acute and chronic psychiatric condition.''
   Johnson also charged the city and its Health and Hospitals Corp.
with negligent security for allowing Smith, who was arrested Jan. 1
for posing as a physician, to live in the closet and walk through
the hospital.
   Moore on Monday filed a notice of claim with the city, the first
step in a lawsuit. Suzanne Halpin, a spokewoman for Health and
Hospitals, said the agencvy would not comment on litigation.

<HEAD>Senate Hears Dispute Over Seating Blind Filers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates for the blind clashed with federal
regulators and aviation industry officials Tuesday over whether it's
safe to allow blind people to sit next to emergency exit doors on
airplanes.
   In a crash involving a fire it is essential to get an evacuation
started immediately and any delay can be fatal, said Anthony J.
Broderick, associate administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   Thus, the FAA has prepared rules that would ban seating any
disabled individual next to emergency exits, Broderick told the
aviation subcommittee of the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee. The regulation would also apply to
pregnant women, small children and others such as frail elderly who
might have difficulties with the emergency exit door.
   During an evacuation ``anything which slows the opening of doors
or impedes the start of passengers getting off the plane increases
the likelihood of fatalities,'' Broderick said.
   But Kenneth Jernigan, executive director of the National
Federation for the Blind, contested Broderick's contention that
blind passengers would slow down the flow of people exiting from a
plane.
   ``The truth is that we are being made victims of a misdirected
and misapplied federal policy that has irrationally gone wild,''
said Jernigan.
   In cases where a cabin was filled with smoke or the lights had
failed, a blind person could be more effective than a sighted one at
getting a door open and helping people leave, Jernigan said.
   ``As far as I have been able to determine, there is not a case on
record in which a blind person has been involved in the blocking of
an exit or the slowing of traffic in an emergency,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, airlines discriminate against the blind, he said,
and the proposed regulation would just make that worse.
   Dan Frye, a blind student, told the subcommittee of a case in
which a flight was canceled because he declined to move from a seat
in the row leading to an emergency door, and said he was threatened
with arrest and publicly humiliated.
   Since there is no way to accurately determine what disabilities
any individual may have, Frye suggested that airlines simply remove
the seats from aisles leading to emergency exits.
   On the other side, however, was the Association of Flight
Attendants.
   Association president Susan Bianchi-Sand said in prepared
testimony that the proposed rules are long overdue.
   Emergency doors do not operate the same as normal doors, the
instructions are often written on them, and opening the door without
being able to check outside could allow a fire to enter the cabin,
she warned.
   In addition, people exiting a plane need to be able to determine
whether the emergency slide has been properly deployed and if there
is water or land or even spilled fuel below.
   In addition, she pointed out that pulling the wrong handle can
detach the emergency chute rather than deploying it.
   Restrictions on who can sit next to the emergency exit need to
apply to anyone why may not be able to lead an evacuation, whether
blind or someone returning from a skiing vacation on crutches, she
said.
   James E. Landry, senior vice president of the Air Transport
Association, also agreed with the proposed FAA rules.
   ``While it may be true that certain blind persons will react
better than certain sighted persons in an emergency situation in a
darkened cabin interior, there is no test by which these qualities
could be discerned by airline employees,'' he said in prepared
remarks.
   That being the case, he said, ``a reasonable, precautionary rule,
applied on a class basis to protect the public safety, is prudent
and sensible.''

<HEAD>Environmental Group Says Birth Defects Among Birds Have Increased</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Birth defects among birds in the Great Lakes
region have increased over the past two decades, according to
research released Tuesday by the Sierra Club.
   The environmental organization said researchers found toxic
chemicals causing the defects are in the food chain.
   A 1986-88 survey of water bird eggs in the upper Great Lakes
region found deformities in Caspian terns occurring 31 times more
frequently than in the late 1960s and early 1970s, said James P.
Ludwig, a consulting ecologist from Bay City, Mich.
   Among deformities found in Ludwig's research were malformed hips,
club feet, eye abnormalities and body organs attached outside the
birds at birth.
   Even low levels of contamination produced effects in the Great
Lakes food chain, Ludwig said.
   ``In a broad sense, these chemicals are eliminating the diversity
in the Great Lakes,'' Ludwig said. ``We have a few species, but the
elegance is gone.''
   His research included birds nesting in highly contaminated areas,
such as Saginaw Bay in eastern Michigan.
   Many contaminants are blown into the lakes from many hundreds of
miles away, an ecologist said in describing research last year on
Isle Royal, Mich., an island in Lake Superior.
   Deborah Swackhammer, an ecologist with the University of
Minnesota, studied fish in Siskiwit Lake on the island and found
concentrations of the toxic chemical polychlorinated biphenyl.
   The PCB could only have reached the lake from the air, since the
lake's level is above that of the surrounding Lake Superior, she
said.
   ``Not only is every fish in the Great Lakes contaminated by
chemicals to some extent, but anything that consumes those fish is
also contaminated to some extent,'' including people, she said.
   The research was released as part of the annual Great Lakes
lobbying project in Washington by the Sierra Club.
   At a news conference, the organization, to demonstrate the
effects of pollution, showed a live cormorant with a twisted beak.
The bird, which was found on Naubinway Island, Mich., in northern
Lake Michigan, may eventually be placed in a Bay City petting zoo.

<HEAD>Simon's Campaign Retrospective: Hart Hurt Me; Dukakis Hurt Himself</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' passionless manner hurt him as
a White House contender and might well have cramped his presidency
if he had won, former Democratic rival Paul Simon says in a new
book, the first by a candidate looking back on the 1988 race.
   ``He enjoys campaigning less than some candidates do,'' Simon
writes of the Massachusetts governor. ``His great weakness as a
candidate _ and perhaps would have been as a president _ is that he
does not convey passion.''
   The Illinois senator's comments are in ``Winners and Losers,'' a
combination memoir and critique that he described in a recent
interview as ``a candid observation'' of the candidates in the race.
   For example, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had ``a brashness of style,''
Simon suggests in the book. Bruce Babbitt became a media darling by
committing ``political suicide'' with a tax-raising proposal.
Dukakis was too remote.
   On the other hand, the Illinois senator gives Dukakis much higher
marks than himself for strategy and dealing with public perceptions
at the outset of the battle for the Democratic nomination.
   Simon had hoped to win the Iowa caucuses but finished second to
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt and now blames himself for not acting
more pleased at the time.
   ``My comments after the Iowa race should have reflected that
upbeat mood of the electorate more than they did,'' he wrote. ``We
had no plans to look cheerful. The Dukakis team had planned to look
excited about coming in third and pulled it off.''
   Simon faults himself for other tactical errors, too, and for
failing to build his campaign around a central theme that would have
been easily accessible to voters. But he also says he was hit by bad
luck at a crucial point.
   He says he had a substantial lead in pre-caucus Iowa polls before
Gary Hart resumed his campaign that had been scrapped amid reports
about an affair.
   When Hart got back in, ``the roof fell in,'' Simon writes.
``Polls taken all over the nation immediately showed him in first
place,'' taking the spotlight from Simon though Hart did not mount a
campaign in Iowa itself.
   In a recent interview, Simon said, ``Gary Hart didn't get back in
with the purpose of hurting Paul Simon. The end result was that he
did.''
   The book is the 12th by Simon, a one-time newspaper publisher,
but the first intended for the mass market. Past efforts have been
examinations of issues such as hunger and foreign-language education.
   ``My last book was about unemployment in this country, and
there's just not a lot of people who want to read about
unemployment. This has a little more general appeal, no question
about it,'' Simon said.
   ``We've had all kinds of people writing about what a campaign is
like, but it's a little different when you're sitting in the chair
of a candidate,'' he said.
   Simon said he also wanted ``to reflect about what's right and
what's wrong about our process.''
   He characterized the campaign as too long, too superficial and
too expensive, and he objected to a proposal for regional primaries,
contending they would make success even more dependent upon money.
   Although he sent copies of the book to his former rivals, Simon
said none has contacted him.
   ``The senator has not read it yet, but he hopes to as soon as he
can get the time,'' said Greta Creech, the deputy press secretary
for Gore.
   Aides to other ex-candidates voiced similar comments.
   Gore was 39 when he announced his candidacy, and Simon says ``his
youth occasionally showed in a brashness of style that time usually
tempers in successful politicians.''
   Babbitt's proposal to increase taxes ``resulted in his becoming
the media's favorite candidate,'' Simon writes. ``Anyone who is
willing to commit political suicide in public ... has a ready market
with political commentators.''
   But ``as his failure to rise in the polls became apparent, Bruce
became a little desperate,'' Simon writes.
   Simon blames himself for a number of mistakes, such as getting
into the race ``without advance planning,'' sometimes misusing
advertising, failing to heed his advisers and ignoring offered help
from volunteers for Joseph Biden after the senator from Delaware
left the race.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Down 0.4 Percent In February</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new 6th graf, At the, with Fitzwater comment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Retail sales dropped 0.4 percent in February,
the biggest decline in almost a year, as business slowed at car
dealerships, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said sales fell to a seasonally adjusted
$138.2 billion last month after rising a strong 0.7 percent in
January, when business was aided by unusually mild winter weather.
   The overall rate was held back by a 1.7 percent drop in
automotive sales last month, the second straight decline in that
category. Car sales had dropped 1.7 percent in January and been
virtually unchanged in December.
   Excluding autos, which account for almost one-fourth of the
retail total, sales edged down 0.1 percent last month after rising a
robust 1.4 percent in January.
   The size of February's overall drop in sales last was matched by
a 0.4 percent drop in April 1988. The last time there was a bigger
drop was in October 1987, when sales plunged 0.9 percent.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The
bottom line is this: It probably helps offset inflationary fears.
There's still only one month's figures. January was up, so there's
no trend here. The economy is still sound.''
   Retail spending, which accounts for about one-third of the gross
national product, is closely watched as a barometer of economic
health.
   Many analysts expect a slowdown in consumer spending this year as
rising interest rates start to take their toll, although few
economists had anticipated a drop in sales for February. The Federal
Reserve Board for a year has been nudging interest rates upward in
an effort to dampen economic growth and thus restrain inflation.
   In the key category of department and other general merchandise
stores, sales fell 0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $10.3
billion last month, following a 2 percent rise in January.
   In a separate report earlier this month, the nation's largest
retailers had reported strong sales for February from year-earlier
levels, spurred by renewed demand for women's apparel and other
consumer and household goods.
   Clothing stores did report a 0.5 percent increase in February
sales from the previous month.
   Among the categories to post big declines in retail sales last
month were: building and hardware stores, down 2.5 percent and
furniture and home furnishing stores, down 0.7 percent.
   The strongest sales were recorded in the category of gasoline
stations, where business was up 0.8 percent.
   Sales of durable goods _ ``big ticket'' items expected to last at
least three years _ plunged 1.3 percent last month after an 0.3
percent decline in January. The drops were partly of a reflection of
the slide in auto sales.
   The decline in the durable goods sector was the biggest since a
2.5 percent drop in October 1987.
   Sales of non-durable goods edged up 0.1 percent last month after
rising 1.4 percent in January.
   In other categorties, retail sales rose 0.1 percent at grocery
and other food stores and at restaurants and bars; and 0.3 percent
at drug stores.

   Former national security adviser Robert
McFarlane testified today that a letter he sent Congress about
Contra support ``probably would have come out differently'' had it
not been written the day before he tried to commit suicide.
   McFarlane responded angrily to John Keker, a prosecutor at Oliver
North's Iran-Contra trial, when questioned today about the Feb. 8,
1987, letter to then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Lee
Hamilton.
   Keker said the letter is ``just complete nonsense, isn't it?''
   McFarlane cited his ``state of mind the day before I tried to
take my life'' and said the letter ``probably would have come out
differently'' if he had ``tried to parse every last dime.''
   The letter said a foreign national offered to contribute money to
the Contras in a May 1984 meeting with McFarlane and that the amount
donated was $5 million or less. In fact, the offer came from the
government of Saudi Arabia through its ambassador, and the country
donated $32 million to the Contras starting in 1984.
   The letter said the money ``was from his (the foreign national's)
own wealth and not from any government.''
   When Keker pointed out that that statement was false, McFarlane
responded: ``That is a gloss, but that is what he (the Saudi
ambassador) told me.''
   ``In my own state of mind, I was acknowledging my participation
in a third-country donation. I knew darn well it was something about
a million dollars a month ... if I had toted up the full amount,''
McFarlane said. He added that ``I am dead wrong'' in the letter
about the amount.
   The letter by McFarlane followed his testimony to the House
Intelligence Committee in December 1986 in which he said he was
unfamiliar with any Saudi contribution.
   His 1986 testimony was one of four misdemeanors to which
McFarlane pleaded guilty to withholding information from Congress in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   McFarlane testified about the events of November 1986, when
details of the Iran initiative were emerging and the diversion of
funds to the Contras was discovered.
   At the request of then-national security adviser John Poindexter,
McFarlane on the night of Nov. 18, 1986, went to North's office,
where the national security council aide reported that government
lawyers ``believed there might be a problem'' with a November 1985
shipment of 18 Hawk antiaircraft missiles from Israel to Iran.
   The possible problem concerned ``whether or not the involvement
of the CIA was appropriate ... or properly executed,'' he said. The
CIA had helped arrange the shipment.
   McFarlane testified that North told him that ``he and I hadn't
learned of this shipment until later on ... he wasn't certain about
it'' and that at the time U.S. officials believed the material being
shipped was oil drilling equipment.
   McFarlane said that ``by 1986 I had no clear recollection'' of
when he had learned of the shipment, which he had been told about in
November 1985 in Geneva. McFarlane had informed President Reagan and
Secretary of State George Shultz of the plans for the Hawk shipment.
   Acting on North's comments, McFarlane changed the chronology by
taking out a reference to the 1985 shipment being Hawk missiles,
replacing it with a general mention of other transfers of
unspecified equipment. McFarlane said the change succeeded as an
effort ``not to contradict the truth,'' which he said he wasn't
certain of at the time.
   One of the accusations against North is that he obstructed
Congress by saying in the final version of the chronology that no
one in the U.S. government learned before January 1986 that Hawk
missiles had been shipped to Iran in November 1985.
   The former national security adviser also testified that he went
into a meeting at Poindexter's office as it was breaking up the next
morning and that someone made the comment that there was no problem
in connection with the Iran initiative.
   ``Just popping off, I said, `I believe you have a problem with
the use of Iran money' for the Contras,'' recalled McFarlane, who
had been told of the diversion by North the previous May. Poindexter
and North returned minutes later and admonished McFarlane that one
of the participants in the meeting was unaware of the diversion, he
testified.
   McFarlane also testified that on a car ride to the White House on
Nov. 21, North said ``we're going to have a shredding party ... to
relieve any fears I had'' about becoming involved in a political
brouhaha with Congress over the Iran initiative.
   McFarlane agreed with Keker that North was referring to
``probably hundreds'' of documents, including memos to McFarlane
spelling out North's involvement in the Contra aid efforts during a
congressional ban on military aid to the guerrillas.
   ``I said, `don't worry about anything','' McFarlane recalled.
``Tell it like it is and everything will be okay.''
   On cross-examination, McFarlane agreed with North lawyer Brendan
Sullivan that North was the hardest-working person he had ever
encountered and that ``you would want him in your life raft.''
McFarlane got two six-month extensions from the Marine Corps for
North to remain at the National Security Council.

<HEAD>NASA Hawaii Tracking Station Closing After 29 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON STATON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   For 23 years from a site high above Waimea
Canyon, Ron Chen has helped NASA monitor America's manned
spaceflights.
   But this week he and about 70 co-workers are tracking the mission
that will cost them their jobs.
   The Kokee Tracking Station is scheduled to close at the end of
the fiscal year on Sept. 30. It is one of six NASA ground stations
being put out of business _ at a savings of $36 million a year _ by
Monday's successful launching from the shuttle Discovery of the
latest Tracking Data and Relay Satellite, TDRS for short.
   ``The kicker is that we are helping to put it (TDRS) in
position,'' said Chen, who as telemetry supervisor processes all the
information coming down from the shuttle.
   The satellite joins one fully functioning and one backup TDRS in
orbit 22,300 miles above the Earth to complete a network that relays
radio communications between shuttles and the Earth during 85
percent of each orbit.
   Using ground stations, radio contact is possible only when the
shuttle is roughly above each station, a total of about 15 percent
of each orbit.
   Chen thinks closing the station is a mistake because of the
chance one of the new satellites could fail. NASA plans to launch a
fourth TDRS as further backup late in 1990.
   ``We've known for a long time that this place would be closing;
it's no surprise,'' said station manager Dan Funamura. ``We were
supposed to have closed 10 years ago.''
   Many of the employees have been at Kokee for 20 years or more and
have established roots here.
   Most have been offered positions by Bendix Field Engineering Co.,
which operates the station for NASA, but most want to remain on
Kauai, Funamura said.
   ``Sometimes I want to go with the company; other times I want to
stay here,'' said Les Sueyasu, operations supervisor, who is the
station's ``voice'' in communications with NASA headquarters in
Houston and the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
   ``Right now, I'm going to stay here,'' said Sueyasu, a native of
Kauai, who has been at Kokee since 1964.
   Funamura, a Kauai native who has been at the station since it
opened in 1960, also plans to stay.
   But job opportunities on the island for skilled technicians are
limited, he said.
   ``It's going to be strange going out into the streets looking for
a job,'' said Ed Edwards, computer systems supervisor, who has been
at the station since it opened. ``I am real attached to the place
and am married to a local girl so my roots are here.''
   The station, which has supported every U.S. manned space flight
except the sub-orbital Mercury flights, is on a 25-acre site at an
elevation of 4,200 feet in Kokee State Park overlooking Waimea
Canyon. The canyon is a popular attraction on the west side of Kauai
Island, about 100 miles northwest of Honolulu.
   Most of the site will be returned to the state. A small section
will be turned over to the Navy, which has radar and telemetry
facilities there.
   Chen points with pride to several important contributions the
station has made to the manned space flights.
   ``We were the first station to detect the electrical problem
which caused the thrusters to keep firing during the Gemini 8
mission,'' he said. The problem cut short the March 1966 mission.
   Kokee also is one of only three tracking stations capable of
processing live television from the shuttles and usually is the
first to receive video from space, Chen said.
   ``We remote it to Houston which makes it available to the
networks,'' he said.
   John Glenn's first manned orbital flight in February 1966 is the
most memorable space mission for Funamura.
   ``We practiced for weeks, and when the actual thing came it was
tremendous,'' he said.
   Other stations scheduled for closing because of TDRS are at
Ascension island in the South Atlantic; Santiago, Chile; Guam;
Dakar, Senegal; and Yarragadee, Australia. They employ a total of
nearly 400 people.

   A puzzling pressure reading on a
hydrogen tank forced Discovery's astronauts to dim lights and turn
off computers and other systems to conserve power today and raised
the possibility of an early return to Earth.
   Mission Control emphasized the trouble posed no threat to the
five-man crew or its mission but could cut the flight from five to
four days.
   The crew members went about their scientific experiments as usual
after the ``powering-down,'' taking pictures of environmentally
damaged areas of the Earth such as the rain forests of Brazil and
the Mexican coastline.
   The order came three hours after the crewmen were awakened by the
raucous shouts of James Brown's ``I Got You (I Feel Good).''
   Flight director Ron Dittmore said the hydrogen tank exhibited
erratic readings.
   The tank is one of three that feeds liquid hydrogen to
Discovery's power-producing fuel cells. Without it, the shuttle
might not have electrical energy to support a five-day flight plus
two days for any contingencies.
   Flight firector Al Pennington said he was optimistic the problem
would be solved. ``Right now we plan to land on Saturday, unless we
get some engineering data that says we can't use that tank,''
Pennington said at a news conference.
   If the tank can't be fixed, the shuttle probably will come home
early, he said. Pennington said a decision would have to be made by
early Thursday.
   Even if the flight were cut short, he said, the astronauts would
achieve most experiment objectives.
   Pierre Thuot, capsule communicator in the control center, told
Discovery commander Mike Coats to turn off some lights and other
systems to assure the crew could complete a four-day mission and
still have capacity to spend two extra days in orbit in case bad
weather or some other problem made it impossible to land on the
fourth day.
   Among the systems shut down were computers deemed unnecessary and
two data display screens. The shuttle has numerous backup computers.
   Today's relatively light schedule contrasted with the fire and
thunder of Monday's liftoff and the release of the $100 million
satellite, the mission's primary task.
   Mission Control in Houston wakened the astronauts with the
recording by the ``Godfather of Soul,'' who is serving six-year
sentence in a South Carolina prison for charges stemming from a
two-state auto chase.
   ``We're trying to figure out how you got James Brown out on
parole to sing that to us,'' quipped Discovery commander Mike Coats.
   ``That was just a special appearance,'' replied capsule
communicator David Low in the control center. ``We thought that was
very appropriate music. You've got the whole ground team here
feeling real good.''
   The deployment of the 2{-ton Tracking and Data Relay Satellite
completes a network that will enable NASA and the Defense Department
to maintain almost constant radio contact with space shuttles and
more than a score of unmanned satellites.
   During the mission's remaining days, the astronauts were to
observe four crippled rats; explore the causes of space sickness;
conduct tracking tests that could have applications to the ``Star
Wars'' program; research treatment of diseases, and film damaged
areas on Earth.
   The astronauts rode Discovery into orbit Monday on the 28th
shuttle flight and the third since the Challenger explosion killed
seven astronauts more than three years ago.
   Before the deployment of tracking satellites, NASA depended on
ground stations and their huge dish antennae around the globe.
Shuttle astronauts could speak to Mission Control only as they flew
over the ground stations, a link that covered only about 15 percent
of each mission.
   NASA will soon close six ground stations at a monthly savings of
$3 million.

<HEAD>Survey: Many Jews Embarrassed By Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many American Jews are embarrassed by Israel's
actions against Palestinian rioters, although support for the Jewish
state remains undiminished, according to a new survey.
   The same survey of 944 Jews found that younger respondents were
less attached to Israel than were older members of their faith.
   That rift extended to criticism of Israel's West Bank policies:
26 percent of those between 55 and 64 said they felt Israel treats
West Bank Arabs unfairly, compared with 42 percent of those under 45.
   The survey was conducted for the American Jewish Committee during
January and February. It is not a random survey; the questions were
mailed to Jews on a list compiled by Market Facts, a market research
company. Sociologist Steven M. Cohen conducted the poll.
   Of those surveyed, 65 percent said Israel had used ``reasonable
and appropriate'' force _ with the exception of ``a few regrettable
incidents'' _ to put down the Palestinian uprising, and 79 percent
felt that Israel was treated unfairly by the press.
   But 54 percent said they felt that the Israelis acted wrongly, at
least to some extent, and 43 percent said they were at least
somewhat embarrassed by Israel's actions. Fifty-one percent said
they were in no way morally outraged by what Israel had done; 35
percent felt some outrage.
   Twenty-two percent said Israel should annex the West Bank, but 38
percent would return land to the Arabs in exchange for peace _ the
same number who support U.S. talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Fifty-eight percent said Israel should talk with the PLO if the
group recognizes Israel and renounces terrorism.

<TEXT>
   Herb London, a syndicated columnist and dean of
an interdisciplinary studies department at New York University, on
Tuesday announced his candidacy for the Republican mayoral
nomination.
   London, a little-known conservative, faces Ronald Lauder, a
cosmetics fortune heir and former U.S. ambassador to Austria.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, is expected to
enter the race.
   ``We will win by focusing on unique solutions to New York's
chronic problems while Mr. Lauder campaigns against Mr. Giuliani's
`liberalism' and Mr. Giuliani campaigns against Mr. Lauder's
money,'' London said.
   London said he favored privatization of city-run housing and the
prompt auction of property taken by the city for back taxes. He also
favors the death penalty for police- and drug-related killings.
   London, 50, is dean of NYU's 1,000-student Gallatin Division,
which he founded in 1972, and a senior fellow at the Hudson
Institute, a conservative think tank.
   In the Democratic race, Mayor Edward I. Koch is expected to face
Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, Comptroller Harrison J.
Goldin and real estate developer Richard Ravitch.
   The primary is set for September and the general election for
November.

<TEXT>
   A judge today denied asylum in New York
to a fugitive Indian activist and ordered him sent back to North
Carolina to face kidnapping charges in a 1988 armed takeover of a
newspaper office.
   Lawyers for Timothy Jacobs filed an appeal even before the ruling
was issued, meaning he will remain in New York while the legal
battle continues.
   Defense attorney Lewis Pitts had argued that Jacobs' life was in
danger in North Carolina because of his knowledge of corruption
there.
   But Madison County Judge William O'Brien II told Jacobs: ``You've
spent the entire time here with the same information about drug
trafficking and there has been no evidence of any harm to you or any
threats to you.''
   The judge revoked Jacobs' $25,000 bail, and the 20-year-old
Tuscarora Indian was taken away to jail.
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin has asked New York to return
Jacobs so he can be tried in the takeover of The Robesonian
newspaper in Lumberton, N.C.
   Jacobs and fellow Tuscarora Eddie Hatcher, 31, both of Pembroke,
N.C., used shotguns to hold 20 people hostage for 10 hours before
surrendering. Hatcher and Jacobs said they were trying to publicize
allegations of corruption.
   The siege ended when Martin agreed to investigate their charges
that county officials were involved in drug dealing and murder. A
task force found no evidence to support the claims, which Martin
later said were based on ``rumor and gossip.''
   A federal jury acquitted Jacobs and Hatcher of hostage-taking
charges in October, but they were indicted by a Robeson County grand
jury in December.
   Jacobs fled North Carolina befoe he could be arrested and tried
to take refuge at the Onondaga Indian reservation near Syracuse.
   Hatcher had fled to Idaho but was arrested Friday by the FBI
after attempting to seek refuge at the Soviet consulate in San
Francisco.

<HEAD>Shark-Bitten Surfer Sues County</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A shark-bitten surfer is suing Dade County for
negligence, arguing that while lifeguards post signs for jellyfish
and dangerous undertows, they fail to advise bathers of possible
shark attacks.
   ``This isn't your typical run-of-the-mill shark attack,''
attorney Scott Silverman told jurors as the trial began Monday.
``Metro-Dade County, for two to three weeks before the attack, had
been having problems with sharks'' at Haulover Beach.
   Jonathan Popper, 22, was bitten May 21, 1983, as he surfed. The
shark grabbed his foot and let go, ripping a nerve and severing
tendons in his right foot. He wants the county to pay him for $5,000
in medical bills, lost time at work and an unspecified amount for
pain and suffering.
   Popper would never have entered the water if he knew sharks were
present, Silverman said.
   ``Sure they had signs for undertow, it's dangerous,'' Silverman
said. ``Sure they had signs for man-of-war, it's dangerous. They
didn't have signs for shark attacks.''
   But Assistant County Attorney Ron Bernstein said Popper, a surfer
since age 13, was well aware of shark dangers. And he said that
while sharks had been reported in the area on previous days, none
was spotted May 21.
   ``This case involved an attack by a wild animal in the Atlantic
Ocean,'' Bernstein said. Popper ``understood that sharks lived in
the area. He knew that from surfing.''

   Thousands of Moslems wept with joy
Tuesday at the return of a seventh century Koran that a religious
leader said symbolizes radical changes in relations between church
and state in the Soviet Union.
   Cries of ``God is great!'' echoed along the book's path in a
display of religious fervor seldom seen in the officially atheist
Soviet Union.
   Crowds pressed in on a cordon of police and engulfed a half-dozen
believers who carried the two-foot-square holy book on their
shoulders 150 yards from a religious congress to the Higher Islamic
Institute in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan.
   One young man jumped from a low portico into the procession as
the Koran was carried through a courtyard. He touched his hands to
his face in a sign of reverence before the crowd swallowed him up.
   Others pushed their way through to grab frantically at the green
velvet covering the holy book.
   More than 100 policemen on patrol did not interfere.
   ``This is our faith! This is the law! This is our truth!''
Ibrahim Yusipov said of the book. He was in a crowd from southern
Uzbekistan.
   Believers wiped tears from their eyes as they watched the book
pass.
   Officials of the government's Council for Religious Affairs and
the Moslem Religious Board for Central Asia and Kazakhstan said they
could not recall such an outpouring of religious fervor.
   Uzbekistan's government turned the Koran of Caliph Osman over to
Moslem authorities at the opening of a congress that elected a new
mufti, or religious leader, for predominantly Moslem Soviet Central
Asia and Kazakhstan.
   Mohammadsadyk Mamayusupov, the 36-year-old rector of the Higher
Islamic Institute, was proclaimed mufti by a voice vote of the 375
delegates.
   He replaced Shamsubdinkhan Babakhan, the hereditary mufti who
resigned in February after religious protests in which he was
accused of corruption and ignorance of Islam.
   Local believers say the ancient book was one of several dictated
by Caliph Osman, a close follower of Mohammed, in the years
immediately following the founding of their religion in 600 A.D. It
was obtained by the Russian czars hundreds of years ago and kept in
their capital, St. Petersburg. After the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution,
it was transferred to a government museum in Tashkent.
   The book likely was turned over as a sign of official support for
Mamayusupov.
   Reporting to the congress after donning the white, gold and
rose-colored robe of the mufti, Mamayusupov praised President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform policies allowing Moslems to open new
mosques and lifting other restrictions.
   ``It is very symbolic that the holy Koran of Caliph Osman has
been returned to us now that radical changes in relations between
the church and the state are taking place,'' said Mamayusupov.
   No protests were evident outside the meeting hall or near the
institute. In separate interviews, founders of the radical group
Islam and Democracy, which claimed it organized the February protest
against Babakhan, said their group was in disarray and had slipped
farther underground.
   They said their protests had hurt their own cause because a
young, strong leader was chosen to replace a weak, corrupt one they
feared would work too closely with authorities.
   The establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the
successes of Moslem insurgents against the Red Army in Afghanistan,
both along the Soviet Union's southern frontier, worry the Kremlin
because they could increase the religious fervor of the Soviet
Union's 50 million Moslems.
   Like other religions in the Soviet Union, Islam is under tight
government control.

   Concerns by the NAACP and ABC's standards and
practices department led to changes in the portrayal of black men in
a new movie co-produced by Oprah Winfrey, according to TV Guide.
   The movie ``The Women of Brewster Place,'' starring Winfrey,
Jackee, Robin Givens, Cicely Tyson and others, is based on Gloria
Naylor's award-winning 1982 novel, which chronicles the lives of
seven black women.
   Two minor but more benevolent male characters in the book were
emphasized, while men who womanize, bully and abandon women were
played by actors who could portray them as more than one-dimensional
villains, the March 18 edition of the magazine says.
   Winfrey said the resulting story, scheduled to air March 19 and
20, still will strike a resonant chord with many viewers.
   ``If you have lived as a black person in America, you know all of
those women, you just know them,'' she said. ``They're your aunts,
your mother, your cousins, your nieces.''

   Academy Award nominee John Cleese returns to
the ``Cheers'' bar to collect an old debt as he reprises his role as
a snobby British psychiatrist on the popular NBC comedy.
   Cleese, a former member of the Monty Python troupe, will film the
episode March 21, eights days before the Oscars. He was nominated
for his screenplay for the movie ``A Fish Called Wanda.''
   In the ``Cheers'' program scheduled to be broadcast April 13, he
plays Dr. Simon Finch-Royce, a specialist in marital and family
counseling.
   Two seasons ago, his character recommended that Sam the
bartender, played by Ted Danson, and Diane, portrayed by Shelley
Long, should not go through with their then-pending marriage.
   Diane's former lover, Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer), recommended
his school chum and fellow psychiatrist to the couple and offered to
pay the fee. Sam and Diane never got married.
   In the new episode, Crane still owes Finch-Royce $1,500 for the
counseling session. Meanwhile, Finch-Royce is promoting his book,
``Successful Marriage and Fidelity.''
   In real life, Cleese has written a book with psychiatrist Robin
Skynner ``Families _ How to Survive Them.''

   The sponsors of an AIDS benefit concert have
dropped Guns 'n Roses because of anti-gay lyrics on someof the heavy
metal band's songs.
   The invitation was withdrawn ``on the basis of the songs'
misinformation about AIDS,'' said officials at Gay Men's Health
Crisis, sponsors of the June 8 ``Rock and a Hard Place'' benefit at
Radio City Music Hall.
   Now sponsors are searching for another name act to save the
concert.
   ``We acknowledge that Guns 'n Roses was the first act to step
forward for `Rock and a Hard Place' and we thank them for their
offer,'' GMHC said in a statement. ``However, after accepting their
offer, the lyrics of several of the cuts on their current album came
to our attention.''
   Among the songs deemed objectionable was ``One in a Million,''
which uses a degrading term for homosexuals and implies they spread
disease.
   Geffen Records, whose chairman David Geffen is one of the vice
chairmen of the benefit, said, ``Guns 'n Roses still wish GMHC every
success with the event.''

   Genscher, who will turn 62 on March 21, entered the University
Hospital in Mainz one week ago after returning from a foreign
ministers' conference in Vienna.
   Genscher had complained of ill health in recent months and has
also suffered from periodic heart and circulatory problems over the

   Workers strung a finish-line banner above Front
Street and installed wiring for TV crews as leaders in the Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race pressed toward Nome.
   ``There is no month of March in Nome,'' said Howard Farley, the
finish coordinator who competed in the first race in 1973. ``It's
the month of Iditarod.''
   The annual 1,168-mile race brings excitement, attention and money
to this town of 4,300 people, and residents have been readying for
the onslaught of mushers, spectators and news teams since
competitors left Anchorage March 4.
   Susan Butcher, who has won the race the last three years, today
struggled to hold off Joe Runyan and Rick Swenson after regaining
the lead from Runyan late Monday.
   ``My dogs love it; they're getting stronger all the time,''
Butcher said in Kouyk, 171 miles from the finish line. She arrived
31 minutes ahead of Runyan but left with only a nine-minute lead.
Swenson left Koyuk 53 minutes behind Butcher.
   Barring a change in the calm weather that mushers have enjoyed
since the race began March 4, the winner should reach Nome sometime
early Wednesday _ perhaps in time to beat Butcher's record of
slightly more than 11 days.
   The progress has been charted by the community's two radio
stations, both of which sent reporters on the trail.
   ``We tend to go into overdrive about a week before the race
starts,'' said Tom Busch, manager of KNOM and a member of the
Iditarod Trail Committee's board of directors.
   Other workers have been busy with chores such as getting
permission to use the Volunteer Fire Department's Christmas lights
and testing the municipal siren that heralds the arrival of each
musher.
   ``Everybody's a hero when he finishes the Iditarod race here in
Nome,'' Farley said.
   Most of the work is carried out by volunteers, although inmates
from the Anvil Mountain Correctional Center have helped install the
sled chute at the finish, City manager Polly Prchal said.
   ``It's a very appreciated, welcome and needed break for us,''
said Patti James, operator of a downtown stoe. ``With the arrival of
the Iditarod and the Iditarod Basketball Tournament, the mood picks
up and the economy surges,'' she said.
   Tourism officials estimate the two events bring 2,000 people to
Nome.
   The city's two hotels and bed-and-breakfast facilities are
booked. Poeple who arrive without lodging are advised to check homes
where sleeping-bag space and the use of a bathroom cost $25 a night.
   ``We never turn people away,'' Farley said. ``If people ever get
the idea that we don't have room, they won't come up.''

   It is illegal in this state to use Drano
without a permit or trot across a toll bridge on the back of a horse.
   But thanks to the state Legislature, Nevadans may win back these
rights _ as well as the sanction to graze cattle within three miles
of the post office.
   ``We asked research to find laws on which there was no
controversy and which were antiquated,'' said Assemblywoman Gaylyn
Spriggs.
   The Assembly voted Monday to repeal the laws, and the Senate is
expected to follow suit.
   Some of the provisions date to 1865.
   A 1911 statute prohibits ``riding or driving any animal or
animals upon a toll bridge faster than a walk.''
   There are no toll roads on private land in Nevada to which the
law would apply, Mrs. Spriggs said.
   Another law set for repeal is a 1901 statute forbidding sheep
herders from grazing their flocks ``within 3-mile radius of post
office of town whose population is 50 or more.''

   No one can insult Oakland County Sheriff
John F. Nichols by calling him a ``pig.'' His office is a shrine to
the animal.
   His collection of more than 300 porcine replicas includes a
60-pound concrete pig and a litter of piglets on his desk.
   ``Some people who walk in on me get so occupied with the display
they forget what they came in for,'' Nichols said.
   Nichols, 70, began his collection as deputy superintendent of the
Detroit Police Department in the 1960s, when anti-Vietnam War
protesters first coined ``pigs'' as a derogatory term for the police.
   ``The term never offended me,'' Nichols said. A visitor to police
headquarters in Detroit gave him his first pig _ a cast-iron replica
he now uses as a paperweight.
   ``Before I knew it, other pigs were brought in and the collection
started.''

<HEAD>Landmark Singapore Hotel Closes For Renovation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Raffles Hotel, a stately but tattered monument
to the grandeur of British colonial days, closed Tuesday for
renovation to help it compete with the city's skyscraper lodgings.
   ``This is a trip down nostalgia lane for me,'' said frequent
visitor Mike Gallagher of Darwin, Australia, as he sat beneath
whirring ceiling fans and sipped a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar,
where the gin-based drink was invented 74 years ago.
   Down the hall, padlocks barred last-day visitors from the
Elizabethan Grill and the Writers' Bar, where literary figures drew
inspiration.
   Somerset Maugham, said to have written ``The Moon and Sixpence''
in his suite overlooking the graceful Palm Court, said Raffles
``stands for all the fables of the exotic east.''
   Joseph Conrad supposedly was inspired to write ``Lord Jim'' while
sitting on Raffles' veranda and reading a newspaper story about a
British crew who abandoned their ship and left 200 passengers to die.
   Rudyard Kipling advised: ``Feed at Raffles when visiting
Singapore'' but sleep elsewhere because the beds were uncomfortable.
   Today's Raffles also is surpassed in comfort by the modern
hotels; it needs a coat of paint, and the plastic cushions in the
cramped lobby could do with replacing.
   But up until Raffles closed its doors at midnight, hundreds of
the curious and nostalgic thronged to the hotel.
   Some danced to Frisco Soliano and his quartet. Others chatted and
drank under the stars in the Palm Court or in the Long Bar, where a
squad of bartenders worked non-stop concocting Slings and pouring
Tiger Beer.
   Raffles will reopen in 1991 after $78 million is spent to
modernize the building, restore the grand original entrance and
build an extension in keeping with the French Renaissance style and
three-story height of the main building.
   ``It will be very faithfully restored as a national monument ...
as a grand hotel,'' said Richard Helfer, an American who is
executive director of the new Raffles property management firm.
   He has been general manager of the two Westin hotels across Bras
Basah Road from Raffles, both skyscrapers like the other new hotels
in this thriving island republic.
   But Helfer said the new Raffles will not be a giant like many
others. Instead, it will have about 110 suites _ fewer than the
present 127 rooms _ at a luxury level of ``six stars if you call
five stars the best.''
   Visitors, he said, will be drawn to a cultural center to be part
of the new extension.
   Raffles is named after Sir Stamford Raffles, who founded the
British colony of Singapore in 1819.
   The hotel dates to the early 1800s when it was founded as a
``tiffin house,'' or restaurant in a private home. But the existing
hotel was started in 1886 by three Armenian brothers.
   Under the British empire, the hotel was a social center for
colonial officials, mariners, planters and merchants.
   But modern, business-minded Singapore seemed to give Raffles
little thought. It was dwarfed by new hotels, and there were fears
it would be razed, as has happened to much of old Singapore.
   Some old monuments have been saved, and the government-controlled
land corporation that holds the Raffles property resisted the
temptation to put up another skyscraper on the valuable land.
   Still, the restoration is a sad event for the staff and those who
run shops in the ground-floor arcade.
   Mohamed Shariff, money-changer and proprietor of a notions shop,
said he and his father before him had made a good living in Raffles
for 45 years.
   ``It's very sad to go,'' he said, adding that he had no hope of
returning in the new hotel. ``There's a new generation coming in.''
   Roberto Pregarz, the general manager who is leaving along with
about 200 jobless staff members, said: ``There's nothing to
celebrate tonight.''

<HEAD>Game Officials Bring Two New Texas Cougars To Florida</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two caged Texas cougars were positioned
Tuesday for eventual release in North Florida as game officials try
to revitalize the state's experiment on expanding the range of the
endangered Florida panther.
   The cats were moved onto private land near the Osceola National
Forest and will be allowed to venture out of the cages on their own
in the next week to 10 days, said Lt. Dewey Weaver of the game
commission's Lake City office.
   In southern Florida, a native panther that has recovered from
injuries suffered when hit by a car last November near Fort Myers
was scheduled to be released Wednesday in Corkscrew Swamp in
northern Collier County. The panther was treated at the University
of Florida's veterinary hospital in Gainesville.
   Fewer than 30 of the Florida cats are believed left in the wild,
in the Everglades in southern Florida. They once ranged across the
state.
   The two Texas cougars, close relatives of the panther and the
Western mountain lion, will be set free under a ``soft release''
technique that allows them to adjust to their new environment before
their cages are opened.
   ``They leave on their own whenever they are ready to leave,''
said Weaver. ``It depends on the cats, how they settle down and get
acclimated to that area.''
   Both the western cougars are adults, one male and one female.
   The cougars, sterilized and fitted with radio-tracking collars,
are being used to test the area for compatibility for Florida
panthers.
   Cougars and panthers have many of the same living habits. If the
cougars can survive in North Florida, game officials might try to
relocate some Florida panthers to the area.
   The habitat expansion program suffered major blows in recent
months with the deaths of three of five cougars released in North
Florida last June. A $7,000 reward is out for information regarding
the deaths of two Texas cats that died under suspicious
circumstances.
   Loss of habitat caused by increasing human population and
development has been the primary reason for the panther's demise.

   A man who was prowling at his estranged

   ``This is the first time I've ever worked someone overdosing on

   The man, whose name was not immediatley released, was discovered
inside the chimney about 10:30 a.m., but authorities believe he had
been there since about 11 p.m. Monday, when the occupant of the
house called about a prowler.
   The man apparently had been trying to get into the home through
the chimney and became stuck, said Sid Stell, a spokesman for the
Midwest City Police Department.
   The man, who was left temporarily speechless by the ordeal, was
taken to a Midwest City hospital complaining of chest pains.

   A review board will
investigate accidents in which two tourists fell to their deaths in
the Grand Canyon in six days, National Park Service officials say.
   A Japanese woman died Sunday when she slipped from a rock on the
South Rim and fell over a 300-foot cliff. The previous week, a West
German woman fell, apparently after fainting at Mohave Point.
   Park Service spokesman Chuck Lundy noted Monday that both
accidents happened in areas with no guardrails. The service tries to
discourage visitors from entering such areas.
   However, he said: ``We feel we have adequate guardrails on the
North and South rims. At some point, it becomes a matter of personal
responsibility. We don't want to restrict access with guardrails all
over the rims.''
   He said all tour companies and the government warn tourists of
dangers at the canyon. The Japanese woman fell only minutes after
the guide for her group mentioned the German woman's death, Lundy
said.

   They were in a temporary facility used to ease overcrowding at
the county's 106-year-old jail. They jimmied a lock on a
malfunctioning fire escape door Saturday night and were caught
Sunday in this city on Maryland's eastern shore, officials said.
   ``The Bible cover is pliable and yet strong enough to jimmy the
lock. The locking mechanism itself wasn't working properly and it
should not have been able to be jimmied like that,'' McKelvey said.
   The two were charged with escape from confinement. If convicted,
they could be sentenced to 10 years.

<HEAD>Amherst Readies For Annual Salamander Migration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A forecast Tuesday of warmer weather thrust
this western Massachusetts college town into preparations for an
annual rite of spring, the migration of spotted salamanders across a
road.
   Several Massachusetts communities annually divert traffic so the
salamanders can get to their breeding pools without getting squished
by passing cars. But Amherst has embraced the six-inch amphibians
with special enthusiasm.
   Last year, more than 200 vounteer salamander herders, about equal
the number of salamanders, turned out for the soggy march that marks
the first rainy spring night when temperatures climb over 40 degrees.
   Typically the salamanders ease out of their winter burrows
between mid-March and mid-April. With temperatures forecast to reach
50 to 60 degrees in the next few days, the town is getting ready.
   Robert Winston, an amateur naturalist who has been helping the
salamanders across the road for more than 12 years, has assembled
volunteer work crews to clear winter debris from the tunnels
constructed for the salamanders.
   Based on similar culverts used in Britain for migrating toads,
the tunnels are 18 inches wide, six inches high and topped with
grates. Winston said most of the salamanders used the tunnels after
mesh fences were installed to guide them to the openings last spring.
   To protect strays who head for the roads, crews erect
``Salamander Crossing'' signs designed by schoolchildren.
   ``It's great. It's nature at its best,'' said Stanley Ziomek,
town public works superintendent, who admits to having a soft spot
for the navy blue amphibians with yellow polka dots.
   The state also is stepping up efforts to protect the salamander
breeding grounds with a certification program that would make at
least some of the vernal pools eligible for protection from
development, said Peter Mireck of the state Division of Fisheries
and Wildlife.
   The pools, which are filled only during the wet seasons, are
crucial to many species, including salamanders and spring peepers,
which need a breeding place where their eggs won't be eaten by fish,
Mireck said.
   Both Mireck and Betsy Colburne of the Massachusetts Audubon
Society said they were hard pressed to account for the state's
fascination with salamanders, but Mireck described their annual
migration as ``a harbinger of spring, almost like the robins.''
   ``And they are very beautiful,'' the biologist maintained.

<HEAD>Cost Estimates for Major Weapons Programs Soaring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The estimated cost of the Pentagon's 94 biggest
weapon programs skyrocketed by $57.5 billion last year, primarily
because the services want to buy more of certain weapons in the
mid-1990s, a new report indicates.
   However, President Bush told Congress in February he would cut
back the military build-up plans of former President Reagan. So the
statistics in the latest Selected Acquisition Report released
Tuesday ``have already been overtaken by events,'' said Jim Turner,
a Pentagon spokesman.
   The update is based on the budget and policy guidelines of the
Reagan administration because Congress mandates the review be
conducted every Dec. 31, Turner said.
   Nonetheless, the report outlines the priorities of the services
and the budget items over which Bush, Congress and the military are
likely to clash.
   As of Dec. 31, the Pentagon said the 94 key programs that Reagan
was pursuing carried a combined pricetag of $818.6 billion, up $57.5
billion or 7.6 percent from a quarterly estimate last Sept. 30.
   Of the increase, $42.7 billion was attributed to changes in
purchasing plans for the middle and late 1990s. And of the $42.7
billion, more than 40 percent stemmed from changes to just three
Navy programs _ big jumps in orders for the DDG-51 destroyer and the
SSN-21 Seawolf submarine, plus an increase in orders for Trident II
missile submarines and missiles.
   Other programs that had won the blessing of the outgoing Reagan
administration for purchase increases in the ``out years'' included
the Army's M-1A1 tank, AH-64 attack helicopter and UH-60 Blackhawk
transport helicopter; the Marine Corps' air-cushioned landing craft,
and the Air Force's Titan IV rocket booster for unmanned satellite
launches.
   Pentagon officials declined comment Tuesday on how those and
other purchasing plans might change.
   The Selected Acquisition Report is a review of all major weapons
programs and is designed to provide a broad gauge of how well the
Pentagon is doing in managing its weapons buying.
   The reports do not reflect any change in a program unless there
are major schedule delays or an increase of at least 5 percent in
the cost. The reports do not disclose when the last year of buying
for each weapon is scheduled.
   In the December report, most of the programs showing cost
increases were cited because of changes in the size of the order as
opposed to management problems. Of the $57.5 billion increase, $2.9
billion was attributed to scheduling problems or changes and $6.9
billion to revised contract estimates, compared to the $42.7 billion
attributed to quantity changes.
   The report shows the Navy planned to increase by 10 the number of
DDG-51 destroyers it purchased _ to a new total of 33 _ as well as
increase from five to 12 the number of SSN-21 Seawolf submarines it
purchased.
   Both of the those ship types are now in development and have yet
to enter the fleet.
   The Navy also planned to increase from 11 to 13 the number of
huge Trident II nuclear submarines it purchased.
   The Air Force planned to buy 34 more Titan IV rocket boosters on
top of the 23 originally approved, and the Army planned to buy 1,460
additional M-1A1 tanks, increasing its total buy to 9,317.

<HEAD>Emergency $100 Million to Be Sought to Deal with Flow of Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will ask Congress for
an emergency $100 million to help deal with a higher-than-expected
flow of refugees this year, particularly Soviet Jews, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said Tuesday.
   Baker disclosed the request in answer to a question from Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., at a sometimes-contentious budget hearing before
the House Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, which Obey
heads.
   Obey noted that the administration was asking for a cut in
refugee spending for the fiscal year opening Oct. 1, despite
increased flows of refugees around the world. ``How on earth are we
going to deal with this problem?'' he asked Baker.
   Baker said a review of refugee programs was under way at the
State Department and would be completed soon after May 1. For the
current year, he said, the administration is preparing a request for
an additional $100 million ``because we can't make it'' to the end
of the year on current appropriations of $412 million.
   The request surprised Obey, who would have to act on any
supplemental money bill for refugees. Baker seemed surprised that
Obey did not know about it, saying he was supposed to have been
notified by the Office of Management and Budget several days ago.
   An OMB spokesman said a supplemental funding package including a
long list of other requests was still being prepared for submission
to Congress.
   The Soviet Union has been permitting Jews to leave the country at
a high rate in recent months, and the State Department said last
week that more than 5,000 are in various stages of processing to
come to the United States. Obey noted that money to pay for
resettlement aid would run out in the next three months.
   Baker said a supplemental money request also would be sent to
Congress to extend U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, who are
encamped in Honduras along the Nicaraguan border. Current
``humanitarian'' aid authority runs out at the end of the month,
although supplies are considered adequate to maintain the rebels at
least through April.
   But he termed ``not accurate'' reports that the request would
total $40 million to $50 million, the amount that would be needed to
last the rebels into early 1990, when Nicaraguan national elections
are scheduled.
   Baker said the effort to maintain the anti-Sandinista Contras in
place was not inconsistent with a call by the five Central American
presidents last month to draw up a plan to disband the 10,000-man
force.
   It represents ``a genuine view that they do represent somewhat of
an incentive for the Sandinista government to keep the promises they
haven't kept in the past,'' including steps toward democratization
and civil liberties, he said.
   Baker and Obey clashed repeatedly over Obey's announced intention
to scale back President Bush's $14.6 billion foreign aid request to
$13.2 billion. Obey said he was skipping ahead of the normal
negotiation process to arrive at the foreign aid figure, which he
said was the necessary result of Bush's refusal to seek new tax
revenues.
   ``Absent new revenues, this is all you're going to get,'' he told
Baker. ``I have read his (Bush's) lips.''
   ``If you really believe these things are important ... this is
not the way to approach the problem,'' Baker responded, charging
that the Obey budget would ignore the ``very real national security
and foreign affairs needs of this country.''
   Obey replied that Democrats are not about to try to dissuade Bush
from his ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge, but will make him face up
to the consequences of not having new revenues, ``because then we
can get rid of these silly, phony promises.''
   He said Congress would never consent to exempt foreign aid
programs from budget cuts while giving an inflationary increase to
the Pentagon and slashing domestic programs such as health and
education.

<HEAD>Troubled by `Pathetic' Homelessness, Bush Vows to Step up Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Tuesday he was troubled by
``ragged, pathetic figures huddled over steam grates'' near the
White House and vowed to step up the search for solutions to the
``national shame'' of homelessness.
   Speaking to a conference of the Independent Insurance Agents of
America, Bush called homelessness ``an affront to the American
dream.''
   He made the comments after his motorcade passed a group of
homeless people huddled on a downtown street a block from the White
House.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said that Bush had
directed Housing Secretary Jack Kemp to come up with new ideas to
help get the homeless off the streets of urban America.
   ``The word has gone forth to come up with solutions,'' Fitzwater
said.
   In his budget outline for fiscal year 1990, Bush proposed
spending $644 million to carry out the McKinney Act, which created a
program to find housing for the homeless. He also called for a new
$50 million program designed to assist volunteers and community
organizations working with the homeless.
   ``Homelessness affects a small proportion of Americans but
concerns us all,'' Bush told his audience.
   The president, who rode alone in the back of his limousine on the
way to the downtown hotel where he spoke, mentioned his glimpse of
the homeless as ``I drove here today.''
   ``Or when you look out the window of the White House and see the
ragged, pathetic figures huddled over the steam grates of the
Ellipse, I see an affront to the American dream _ a national shame,
if you will.''
   ``We must seek the root causes of and devise the most practical
solutions for the homelessness,'' he said.
   Turning to issues affecting business, Bush told the audience of
insurance agents he opposed what he called a ``mounting movement
towards mandated employee benefits.''
   ``In an area of tight budgets, there's always the temptation to
drop the burden of social programs on the backs of the employers ...
But burdensome mandated benefits serve neither business nor labor.''
   Bush did not elaborate on what he meant by ``mandated benefits.''
But in a speech last week, Vice President Dan Quayle voiced similar
concerns, specifying that of ``immediate concern'' was legislation
mandating parental leave, legislation requiring health benefits and
a ``large, across-the-board increase in the minimum wage.''
   The president also said he favors limits on liability judgments
handed down by juries.
   ``When local governments cannot install playgrounds, when
businesses are bankrupted, when mothers struggle to find an
obstetrician, when volunteer organizations _ Boy Scouts and Girl
Scouts and others _ have to pull back for fear of excessive claims,
then it is time to consider limiting some of these outrageous
settlements,'' Bush said.
   He also defended anew his proposal for a lower tax on capital
gains, saying, ``let the critics carp. I'm going to push for this
idea that will stimulate jobs, risk-taking, capital formation. And
it's good for the economy and it is not a special tax break for the
rich.''
   Fitzwater, Bush's press secretary, said that the president's
statements on homelessness were ``a follow-up'' to views he had
expressed during last year's presidential campaign.
   In a 193-page report to Congress summarizing his fiscal 1990
budget proposals, Bush said his administration was ``committed to
addressing forcefully the tragedy of homelessness through public and
private action.''
   ``The homeless face difficult and sometimes seemingly
overwhelming obstacles in getting back on their feet,'' he said in
that message.
   District of Columbia officials estimate there are some 8,000 to
10,000 homeless in Washington although activists for the homeless
have said they believe the figure ranges to 15,000.
   Nationally, experts agree there are no reliable figures, although
research shows that the level of homelessness can range from 300,000
to 600,000 on any given night.

<HEAD>Iran Demands Moslem Support of Order to Kill Rushdie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALY MAHMOUD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran demanded Tuesday that Moslems
uphold its order to kill Salman Rushdie as a blasphemer for writing
``The Satanic Verses'' and said they must condemn all who take the
writer's side.
   It made the demand at a meeting in Riyadh of foreign ministers
from the 46-member of the Organization of Islamic Conference, where
little support for Iran's extreme position has been evident.
   Although the Iranians succeeded in getting the Rushdie affair on
the agenda of the closed, four-day conference, it was referred to
political committee and some delegates said it should be considered
only as a cultural topic.
   Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, is not attending the
meeting, which began Monday. The chief Iranian delegate, Mohammmad
Ali Taskhiri, conveyed his government's demands to The Associated
Press:
   ``All delegations will issue a strong resolution in denunciation
of Rushdie, his book and publisher along with all the governments
that support him. We expect all Moslems to uphold God's judgment in
this connection.''
   His second point referred to the fatwa, or religious execution
decree, issued Feb. 14 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the
88-year-old Shiite Moslem patriarch of Iran.
   Rushdie's novel was published in 1988. Earlier this year, it
caused riots in India and Pakistan in which 19 people were killed.
Most Islamic nations and others with large Moslem populations have
banned it.
   Indonesia and Singapore joined the list Tuesday and the religious
affairs minister of Turkey, a predominantly Moslem secular state,
said the book should be banned there.
   Rusdie, 41, was born in Bombay, India, to Moslem parents but now
is a British citizen and has said he no longer practices religion.
He went into hiding after Khomeini ordered him killed and Iran's
Islamic clerics offered a reward of $5.2 million.
   Britain's partners in the 12-nation European Economic Community
recalled their ambassadors to Iran after the death sentence, along
with Norway, Sweden and Canada. Iran broke relations with Britain on
March 7 because it refused to suppress the book and act against
Rushdie.
   In calling his novel blasphemous, Moslems cite a scene in which
prostitutes are given the names of Mohammed's wives, and a
suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than
receiving it from Allah.
   Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, took issue
with Taskhiri and noted the delegates had not reached a consensus on
the book.
   ``Four delegates addressed the conference on the Rushdie affair
during the morning session and I heard none of them say anything
about upholding the death sentence,'' he told a news conference.
   He said the Organization of Islamic Conference believes Islam
``is not an easy prey for those bent on harming it, and I don't
believe the faith is in any danger. We are not afraid of any attacks
that may come from books or any media organ.''
   Taskhiri, who heads the Islamic affairs division of the Iranian
Foreign Ministry, said Rushdie's book was ``a rabid campaign against
our Islamic ideals and beliefs ... a crushing onslaught on Islam
requiring a strong and decisive response.''
   Speaking for Saudi Arabia, Saud said: ``We are waiting to hear
the statements of the delegates.'' He said the Saudies were in touch
with several countries to prevent the matter from ``damaging
prospects of religious tolerance.''
   King Fahd's government has banned ``The Satanic Verses'' but has
not supported the Iranian demand that Rushdie be killed.
   A group of Islamic theologians meeting in Mecca, Saudi Arabia,
the holiest shrine of Islam, issued a declaration Tuesday that
Islamic law allows Rushdie the opportunity to repent.
   Other issues on the conference agenda include the Palestinian
problem and ways of regaining occupied territory from Israel.
   A subcommittee of Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan,
Algeria and Tunisia was appointed to consider those issues, Saud
told reporters. Egypt is the only Arab nation to have signed a peace
treaty with Isrel.
   About Afghanistn, he said Moslem guerrillas have ``received the
support of the OIC since the beginning of their struggle'' against
Soviet military forces and the Islamic organization ``will continue
to support them.''
   Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan was completed Feb. 15 and the
guerrillas are trying to oust the communist government in Kabul.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Palestinian uprising on Tuesday
called for increased anti-Israeli activity and ordered Palestinians
working for the military government in the occupied lands to quit or
face violent consequences.
   The clandestine pro-PLO leadership distributed its leaflet a day
after Foreign Minister Moshe Arens met in Washington with President
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Arens, interviewed from Washington on Israel's Army Radio, said
the U.S. administration made no concrete proposals about how to
reduce tensions in the territories.
   ``I said nobody is interested in reducing this tension more than
we are. But how to do that is another question,'' Arens said.
   Arab hospital officials said soldiers shot and wounded six
Palestinians in the occupied territories Tuesday and severely beat a
12-year-old boy with clubs, fracturing his skull.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   The Arab reports said five of the shootings occurred in the Gaza
Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp and that the boy was beaten in Gaza
City's Zaitoun quarter. The other shooting occurred in the West Bank
city of Nablus, they said.
   At least 396 Palestinians and 17 Israelis have been killed since
the uprising broke out Dec. 8, 1987.
   In its new leaflet, the Unified National Leadership of the
Uprising called on Palestinians who work in the service branches of
the Israeli military government in occupied areas to resign
immediately or be attacked ``violently.''
   ``Consider this leaflet as a last warning,'' the notice said.
   It also called for intensifying resistance to Israeli rule and
ordered a boycott of Israeli goods beginning March 28.
   Israel's mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot newspaper gave
front-page play to a story that three unnamed members of the
right-wing Likud bloc met with unidentified PLO leaders in Tunis in
an effort to end the uprising.
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the head of Likud,
denied the report.
   Science Minister Ezer Weizman, of the rival Labor Party, accused
Shamir of trying to avoid peace negotiations and said Labor should
quit the coalition government if Shamir does not get Israel to the
negotiating table to summer.
   ``I don't want to be unkind to him, but I have a feeling he would
like to twiddle and turn and do some political aerobatics and find a
way to have his cake and eat it,'' Weizman told reporters in his
office.
   ``Let's say if by June, July, August, nothing happens... I think
the Labor Party has to crystallize their policy and get the hell out
of the government,'' he said.
   Shamir refuses to speak to the Palestine Liberation Organization,
saying it is a terror organization that wants to destroy the Jewish
state. Contacts with the PLO are outlawed in Israel, although
legislators have immunity from prosecution.

<TEXT>
   Romanian media reported Tuesday that a
senior Romanian diplomat had been charged with espionage, and emigre
sources linked the case to a letter by veteran communists demanding
improved human rights.
   An announcement from the Romanian General Prosecutor's office
carried in Romanian dailies and on the state news agency Agerpres
said Mircea Raceanu had been ``engaged in steady treasonable
action'' since 1974 when he allegedly was recruited to spy for an
unidentified country.
   Raceanu served in Washington during the 1970s and most recently
was deputy head of the Foreign Ministry's U.S. desk in Bucharest. He
was arrested in January.
   The General Prosecutor's office did not mention a letter that
five Communists and Raceanu's father had signed, condemning economic
and political policies of President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The letter, written in January, first reached the West over the
weekend and was prominently reported on Western radio stations
broadcasting to Romania.
   It also was reported by official media in Yugoslavia and Hungary,
indicating Romania's growing isolation from its Communist allies.
   The letter marked the first time senior communists have banded
together to protest Ceausescu's policies.
   It attacked Romania's isolation in Europe and Ceausescu's plans
to destroy up to 7,000 of the country's 13,000 villages in a
resettlement campaign.
   ``How are you going to improve Romania's external relations when
all the leaders of the non-communist nations of Europe refuse to
meet with you?'' the letter said according to a text made available
to The Associated Press.
   It demanded an immediate halt to food exports from the
shortage-plagued agricultural nation.
   The letter also condemned a late 1970s decree that forbids
Romanians to speak to foreigners, and denounced alleged systematic
violations of private mail and telephone communications.
   It was signed by Raceanu's father, Ion, former Politburo members
Gheorghe Apostol and Alexandru Birladeanu, former Foreign Minister
Corneliu Manescu and party veteran Constantin Pirvelscu.
   Silviu Brucan, a former ambassador to the United States, was the
sixth signatory. Repeated calls in the past three days to Brucan's
Bucharest home have gone unanswered.
   Radio Bucharest played what it said were taped interviews from
workers' meetings in several Bucharest plants. It did not explain
how such gatherings could be organized just hours after the first
publication of the charges against Raceanu.
   ``I was stupefied after reading the communique in our press. Our
Socialist justice must deal exemplary punishment to such traitors,''
a worker from the Grivita Rosie chemical equipment plant in
Bucharest was heard saying.
   ``Foreign circles, envious of Romania's achievements, are trying
to torpedo its achievements,'' another said.
   Emigre sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Raceanu
and his wife were detained Jan. 31 en route to the U.S.
amabassador's residence for a film showing, but that she later was
released.
   A Western diplomat in Bucharest confirmed by telephone that
Raceanu was invited to the movie, but did not show up. Raceanu later
was said to have been transferred from his Foreign Ministry post,
said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The maximum penalty for treason is death, if the espionage is
deemed to cause grave damage to state security. The next most severe
penalty is 20 years in jail.

<TEXT>
   Jakob Gimpel, a pianist whose career began at
age 8 in his grandfather's theater in Austria and brought him renown
in the concert halls of America and Europe, has died. He was 82.
   Gimpel died Sunday at his home in Westwood, said his son, Peter.
   The pianist, who had retired a few years ago as distinguished
professor in residence at California State University, Northridge,
had suffered from arthritis and circulatory problems, his son said.
   He performed his last recital in 1987, at the University of
California, Los Angeles, despite great shoulder pain, Peter Gimple
said. He added that his father ``continued to play very bravely''
through years of arthritic pain.
   As a professor he told his students, ``Performing artists must
have tenacity, endurance and courage.''
   The child of musical parents, Gimpel became proficient on the
piano at an early age, recalling years later that by his eighth
birthday he was performing at a theater his grandfather owned.
   ``I had my union card,'' he said. ``I played in a cabaret. Of a
childhood, I had absolutely none. But all these experiences made me
a better musician.''
   He made his concert debut in 1923, and in 1938 moved from his
native Vienna to the United States with his wife, Mimi.
   In Los Angeles, Gimpel played with the MGM orchestra, but labored
primarily in obscurity until 1949, when he was invited to
participate in the New York segment of the Chopin centennial.
Reviews were favorable.
   He returned to Europe to perform concerts in 1954.
   West Germany awarded him the Order of Merit, First Class for his
``great service as an interpreter of German Music'' and in
recognition of his role in the resumption of German-American
cultural relations following World War II.
   He was the brother of the late violinist Bronislaw Gimpel, a
former concertmaster of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
   He is survived by his wife and son. A funeral was held Monday.

<HEAD>US May Increase Aid to Cambodian Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is weighing the
possibility of an increase in assistance to non-communist resistance
forces in Cambodia, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
   That issue was discussed Monday with Prince Norodom Ranariddh, a
leader of a rebel group headed by his father, former Cambodian head
of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   At present, the administration plans to provide the resistance
with about $7.5 million in non-lethal aid during the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1.
   Some members of Congress have expressed interest in providing
military aid to the anti-communist rebels but the officials said the
Bush administration is opposed to any change in the existing program.
   Prince Ranariddh, who met with President Bush on Monday, was
meeting with members of Congress on Tuesday.
   The administration's goals in Cambodia include promoting the
withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and the emergence of a democratic
government to replace the Hanoi-dominated regime now in power.
   In addition, the administration opposes any significant role for
the third rebel group operating in Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge. That
group is accused of pursuing policies that led to the deaths of more
than 1 million Cambodians during their 1975-78 rule.
   In Beijing, meanwhile, the two non-communist resistance forces
took a first step Tuesday toward unifying their armies by forming a
defense council headed by Prince Sihanouk.

<HEAD>Empress Zita of Austria Dead at 96</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZIZERS, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Empress Zita of Austria, the last
queen of the Hapsburg empire who was denounced as a spy for her role
in a plot to end World War I, died Tuesday in this town 20 miles
from the country that shunned her. She was 96.
   Her late husband, Charles I, was the last king of the
multilingual Austrian-Hungarian monarchy who gave up his imperial
rights after the Allied victory in World War I.
   The empress, who never formally abdicated and was barred from
Austrian territory for 64 years, had been ailing for some time, said
Bernd Posselt, a spokesman for the House of Hapsburg.
   Born May 9, 1892, in Pianore Castle, near Viareggio, Italy, the
former Princess of Bourbon-Parma was related to several European
royal families.
   Charles I became Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary after the
death of his uncle, Francis Joseph, who had reigned for 68 years.
   When Charles and Zita were crowned, they believed only a rapid
truce could save the crumbling dual monarchy, then allied with the
Reich of the German Kaiser. Zita, then 24, had a key role in
arranging secret contacts with the Allies in search of a peace
treaty.
   The go-between was her brother, Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma,
then serving in the Belgian army. He was in touch with French
President Raymond Poincare who, in turn, notified King George V of
Britain.
   French Premier Georges Clemenceau, who hated Poincare, revealed
the secret in 1918, creating an international stir and rocking the
German-Austrian alliance. German propaganda whipped up sentiment
against the once-popular Zita, labeling her ``the spy of the
Bourbons.''
   After the Allied victory in 1918, Charles I agreed to
``temporarily relinquish'' his imperial rights. The couple initially
lived in exile in a Lake Geneva chateau, where Charles launched two
attempts to recapture the Hungarian throne.
   After the second bid in 1921, the Allies banished them to the
Portuguese island of Madeira. Charles died there of pneumonia a year
later, at age 34.
   Zita was a 29-year-old widow and mother of eight. Turning down
invitations from royal relatives, she chose to bring up her children
in modest settings in a Spanish fishing village and the Belgian
countryside.
   When Adolf Hitler moved to annex Austria, her oldest son, Otto,
the new head of the House of Hapsburg, urged the Western allies to
intervene, which made the Nazis issue an order for his arrest.
   The family fled to Canada and the United States, living for a
time in Tuxedo Park, N.Y.
   After World War II, Zita toured American cities to promote
humanitarian aid for Austria. In the early 1950s she returned to
Europe, eventually settling at Zizers.
   In 1982, Austria lifted the entry ban following a personal
request by King Juan Carlos of Spain. On her first return to Vienna,
she was cheered by 10,000 people.
   Since 1965, Zita, who once held court at Vienna's
Versailles-sized castle of Schoenbrunn, lived in two small rooms of
a Roman Catholic home for the aged in this village on the Upper
Rhine. She turned down offers for a bigger apartment. Family photos
and an oil portrait of her husband provided a personal touch in her
small living quarters.
   Zita dressed in black from the time her husband died and never
wore jewelry.
   The empress will lie in state in the Austrian capital at St.
Stephen's Cathedral. She will be buried April 1 at the traditional
Hapsburg burial vault in Vienna's Capuchin Church.
   Charles is buried on Madeira. One of Zita's wishes was that his
remains be transferred to Vienna so they could be reunited in death.

<HEAD>Derwinski Ready to Move Up to Cabinet with Veterans Department</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As he prepares to take a seat at the Cabinet
table, Edward J. Derwinski is warning military veterans not to
expect miracles from the new Veterans Affairs Department but
``painful'' budgets in the next few years instead.
   ``I was never one to promise what I couldn't produce,'' the
former Illinois congressman said in an interview. ``I would much
rather under-promise, and have them pleasantly surprised at the end,
than overpromise.''
   Derwinski heads the second-largest agency in the federal
government, the Veterans Administration, which on Wednesday becomes
the 14th Cabinet department. Veterans groups had sought the
upgrading for years, but the election-year endorsement of the idea
by then-President Reagan was needed to bring it about.
   To mark the change, Derwinski will take the oath of office at the
White House and attend a ceremony on the South Lawn.
   ``In the long run, I think we're going to do well,'' Derwinski
said Monday. He said he was talking about ``five, 10 or 15 years.''
   The short run is a different story.
   ``What I tried to tell the American Legion is the mere creation
of a department is not the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for
us budget-wise,'' he said.
   Derwinski said he was ``assuming that the political facts of life
are that in the short run, neither the president nor the Congress is
going to step out and say, `I want new taxes.'''
   He said he further assumed ``neither the president nor the
Congress is going to step out and say, `Scrap
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings,''' the law requiring declining budget
deficits.
   ``So my personal view is that the law will run its course, the
discipline of it will run its course. That's the next four years. In
those four years there are going to be some painful budget
decisions. My job is to see that the VA does better in the budget
infighting than it would have if I weren't aboard.''
   That is precisely why the veterans organizations and their
congressional supporters fought so long for the department: They
believed the rank of a Cabinet officer would enable them to do
better in the infighting.
   Whether it will happen that way remains to be seen. In a report a
year ago, the National Academy of Public Administration said it did
not believe Cabinet status ``would significantly improve either
access to the president, the adequacy of necessary resources or the
organization, management and delivery of high-quality services and
benefits.''
   Though its 240,000 employees are more than any federal agency
except the Defense Department, and its budget is the fifth largest,
the VA is an uncomplicated organization. Derwinski has six months to
reorganize it, but he says any changes ``won't be drastic.''
   There are basically just three parts: medical care, money
benefits and the operation of 111 national cemeteries where 53,000
veterans and members of their families are buried every year
   The first two parts are gigantic. With 172 hospitals, 229
outpatient clinics and scores of other installations, the agency
runs the largest medical care system in the country and one of the
largest in the world, spending $10.8 billion a year and taking care
of 1.4 million hospital patients annually.
   Veterans benefits _ pensions, insurance, mortgage guarantees and
other programs _ account for about $17 billion a year.
   Derwinski has been praised by members of Congress for his open
style and for winning approval in principle from the Office of
Management and Budget for a $300 million supplemental appropriation
for the current fiscal year for VA medical care.
   He said in the interview that the approval was only ``90 percent.
We don't have the official OMB blessing.''
   Some of the agency's medical issues have been front-page issues
for years. For example: post-traumatic stress disorder in Vietnam
veterans and possible health effects of the defoliant Agent Orange.
   Derwinski, though, is looking down the road.
   ``The big problem is one, interestingly, where there is no
debate: aging. The patient's needs start to change. ... It
ultimately means long-term health care rather than dramatic surgical
procedures.''
   It is projected that the number of veterans over 75 will grow
from more than 1.2 million to 4.4 million in the year 2005.

<HEAD>Warning Labels Required on Promotional Items</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission must require
health warnings on promotional items such as T-shirts, caps and tote
bags given away by makers of snuff and chewing tobacco, a federal
appeals court ruled Tuesday.
   The commission disregarded the clear instructions of Congress
when it exempted those items from the 1986 requirement of health
warnings in advertising for smokeless tobacco products, said a
three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia.
   The panel's decision upheld a lower court ruling of last year.
   The 1986 legislation at issue exempted only billboards, and
congressional sponsors of the bill submitted statements to the
commission that they fully intended promotional items bearing
product logos to carry the warnings.
   The warning must be one of these:
   _``Warning: This product may cause mouth cancer.''
   _``Warning: This product may cause gum disease and tooth loss.''
   _``Warning: This product is not a safe alternative to
cigarettes.''
   The commission said it feared the phrase ``this product'' would
be taken as referring to the T-shirt or other item, rather than the
tobacco, and thus be ridiculed.
   ``The commission is sensitive to the need to avoid diminishing
the seriousness of the required warnings by mandating their display
in absurd situations,'' the commission said.
   The court's decision, however, said, ``Warnings on these items
would have conceded benefits; the FTC's position is that the
perceived negative effects _ derision, etc. _ would either outweigh
those benefits or render them minimal. This balancing requires a
more explicit congressional grant of authority than is present
here.''
   The commission's case might have merit if the congressional
directive would clearly lead to absurd results, but ``Congress'
rigidity is not a sign of its folly, but rather signals its intent
to act swiftly and deciively to stem the dangerous growth of
smokeless tobacco consumption. Whatever else may be said, Congress
has the general authority to take such rigid measures,'' the court
said.
   Susan Ticknor, a spokeswoman for the commission, said lawyers
there had not seen the decision and could not comment.
   The exemption for promotional items was challenged by the
American Heart, Lung, and Public Health associations, the American
Cancer Society and Public Citizen, and was defended by a trade
association, the Smokeless Tobacco Council, in a friend-of-the-court
brief.

   Washington's worst outbreak of meningococcal
disease in more than a decade has caused four deaths this year and
has health officials considering a costly countywide vaccination
program.
   Seventeen people have contracted some form of meningococcal
disease, including six who got meningitis, inflammation of the
membranes that envelop the brain and the spinal cord.
   ``People are freaking out about this all over,'' said Marcy
Smith, whose 2-year-old daughter was one of about 400 people
vaccinated Monday. The shots went primarily to children in this
Yakima Indian Reservation town of 3,300 about eight miles south of
Yakima.
   ``I think we are on top of the current cases,'' Yakima County
health director Dr. Bob Atwood said as the battle against the
disease intensified. He said officials knew of no other suspected
cases. ``I'm not willing to predict there won't be another case,''
he said.
   Fighting the disease has cost the county $30,000 to buy vaccine,
and an as-yet uncalculated amount in overtime pay for employees
working 16-hour days. If the health department decides on a
countywide vaccination program, the cost of medical supplies is
estimated at $356,000, health officials said.
   County commissioners said they planned to inform Gov. Booth
Gardner's office Tuesday about the costs and were considering
whether to ask for emergency state assistance, said Sylvia Hinojosa
of the commission office.
   The state Department of Social and Health Services has alerted
other counties to be on the lookout for any increase in
meningococcal disease but knows of none outside Yakima County, said
Dr. Nancy Snapp.
   Seventy to 80 cases of meningococcal disease are reported in the
state each year, and the Yakima outbreak is the largest since 1978,
officials have said.
   The dead include three children under age 1{, and a 23-year-old
Yakima man.
   In Selah, an apple country suburb north of Yakima where the 17th
case was confirmed over the weekend in an infant, 2,400
schoolchildren were given notices to report to a school to be
interviewed by health workers and if necessary receive either the
vaccine or Rifampin, which kills the meningococcal germs in the nose
and throat and thus halts the spread of the disease.
   ``We identified five children playing with the infant on a daily
basis,'' Atwood said.
   The disease is primarily passed through coughing and other
contact with secretions from the nose and throat, Atwood said.
   The health director has come under fire for a decision to
withhold information about the outbreak from the public until
reporters found out about it late last week.
   Noting the disease has all the symptoms of the common cold,
Atwood said he feared anxious parents would overload medical
facilities and delay health care for the truly sick. Emergency rooms
were flooded by concerned parents over the weekend, he said.
   Meningococcal disease usually has a mortality rate of 10 percent,
while the Yakima outbreak is running at nearly 25 percent.
   Officials have contacted the federal Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta to help determine why this outbreak, which is of the
less-common Type C strain of the disease, is so dangerous.

   The Bush administration announced today the
immediate suspension of imports of thousands of semiautomatic
assault-type weapons.
   The order, effective immediately, will bar the importation of
more than 110,000 such weapons for which import applications are
pending, said national drug control director William J. Bennett.
   Bennett said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady ``decided to
suspend, effective immediately, the importation of several makes of
assault-type weapons pending a decision as to whether these weapons
are, as required by law, `particularly suitable for or readily
adaptable to sporting purposes','' Bennett said.
   Bennett and Brady had been asked to look into ways of dealing
with the proliferation of such weapons amid mounting violence among
drug dealers in inner city areas.
   The decision came after conferences among Brady, Bennett and
Stephen E. Higgins, the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, who supported the decision.
   ``They've been conferring during the last week,'' said ATF
spokesman Dick Pedersen. ``Higgins and Bennett together felt it was
time to suspend the importation, so we are doing that.''
   In the past three years, ATF has approved the import of 88,000
such weapons, and in 1989 so far, the ATF has received requests to
import many more than the total imported during the previous three
years, Bennett said in a statement.
   Affected by the decision are imports of AK-47s, Uzi carbines,
FN-FAL and FN-FNC-type weapons as well as Steyr Aug semiautomatic
weapons.
   ``ATF has the authority to regulate the importation of weapons
into the United States, to make sure they fall into certain
categories,'' Pedersen said. ``We're saying some of these weapons
may not fall into some of the prescribed categories, such as
hunting.''
   ``We're not going to approve these pending applications until we
have time to look at the situation further to see if these firearms
do meet the conditions set forth for their importation,'' he said.
   Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, had
voiced concerns about the weapons but said he also wanted to ``do
what's right by the legitimate sportsman.''
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the import ban was
decided on after it was learned that applications for imported
semiautomatics had tripled this year over the total for the past
three years.
   The administration action came a day after the California State
Assembly voted to ban 40 types of semiautomatic assault weapons.
That legislation must be reconciled with an earlier vote by the
California State Senate to ban all semiautomatic weapons fitting a
certain description.

<TEXT>
   The head of the International Federation of
Newspaper Publishers appealed Tuesday to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to release dissident journalist Sergei Grigoryants from
jail.
   Grigoryants, editor and publisher of the unofficial magazine
Glasnost, was detained along with a colleague while taking pictures
of an unauthorized demonstration in Moscow on Sunday, said the
Paris-based federation.
   According to reports from Moscow, the two journalists were
sentenced to 10 days in prison.
   ``This continued harassment of a journalist trying to do his job
is intolerable and makes a mockery of your policy of glasnost,''
federation President Giovanni Giogannini of Italy said in his
message to Gorbachev. ``On behalf of newspaper publishers worldwide
I appeal to you most earnestly to release these journalists
immediately.''
   Grigoryants was named this year's winner of the group's Golden
Pen award for press freedom. He has been regularly arrested for his
publishing activities since being released from prison in 1987.
   He has been invited to the World Congress of Newspaper Publishers
in New Orleans in June to receive his prize.

   The jury found Younis guilty on three counts in the six-count
indictment, and acquitted him on the remaining three.
   Younis faces life imprisonment for the most serious charge,
taking hostages.
   The verdict was viewed as an affirmation of a 1984 law asserting
U.S. jurisdiction over the taking of American hostages abroad. Two
Americans were aboard the airplane. No one was killed.
   The jury began deliberations last Friday afternoon, adjourned for
the weekend, and returned the verdict at 4 p.m. EST.

   The jury found Younis guilty of conspiracy to commit sky piracy,
which carries a maximum sentence of five years; seizing hostages,
life imprisonment; and hijacking a commercial airliner, 20 years.
   The jury returned innocent verdicts on charges of using or
threatening violence against passengers or crew members of a
commercial airliner, destroying a civilian aircraft, and carrying
aboard a civilian aircraft devices likely to damage it.
   During two days on the witness stand last week, Younis
acknowledged that he led a band of five heavily armed men aboard
Royal Jordanian Airlines Flight 402 in Beirut on June 11, 1985, and
held its 70 passengers and crew members hostage for 30 hours.
   But Younis testified that he was acting under orders from the
Amal militia, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem group to which he belonged.
He said that although he knew that hijacking was illegal in
peacetime, Amal was engaged in the Lebanese civil war.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. told the jury,
however, that ``orders to hijack a plane ... are illegal orders.
Obedience to illegal orders is no defense.''
   Younis was lured aboard a yacht and arrested in international
waters in the Mediterranean Sea on Sept. 13, 1987 by a team that
included members of the FBI hostage rescue squad, the U.S. military
and intelligence agencies.

   TABA, Israeli-Occupied Egypt (AP) _ Employees of the Sonesta
Hotel saw to it Tuesday that this patch of a tourist resort, an
irritant to Israeli-Egyptian relations for years, would not be
handed over to Cairo without one last fuss.
   They waved signs and Israeli flags and burned tires in a
demonstration to ask what will become of them when the 250-acre
strip of beach becomes part of Egyptian territory on Wednesday.
   ``The hotel is in Egypt, the management is in Israel, and the
employees are in the garbage,'' said a sign carried by one of the
more than 300 workers.
   They staged the protest as Egyptian workers in long galabia robes
put up a border gate and Israeli soldiers in drab olive uniforms
built their barrier nearby.
   Egyptian Tourism Minister Fuad Sultan walked by scores of
protesters and said all was going well.
   ``I'm sure that this will be the cornerstone for a better
normalization process between the two countries,'' he said.
   So far, Taba has had exactly the opposite effect.
   When Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula under a peace
treaty in 1982, it stayed in Taba, which contains little more than
the 12-story hotel and a village of thatched huts.
   Both Israel and Egypt maintained the land was theirs, with their
arguments tracing back to where the border was in 1906 between
British-held Sinai and Turkish-ruled Palestine.
   In September, an international arbitration panel accepted Egypt's
version. On Feb. 26, the nations agreed the land would be handed
over to Egypt on Wednesday.
   On Tuesday, Egyptian and Israeli officials worked out final
details, including arranging passes _ stamped by Egypt, Israel and
the Sonesta Hotel _ to give Israeli workers access to their jobs.
But the employees are worried about an Egyptian law requiring that
90 percent of workers in a hotel be Egyptian.
   ``Tomorrow this is going to be Egypt, and we don't know what's
happening,'' said Erez Efrat, the 30-year-old protest leader. ``They
tell us we don't have a problem, but what about in a month?''
   The workers also are concerned about economics. One carried a
sign saying: ``An Egyptian works for $100 a month, an Israeli for
$1,000. Who do you think will be employed?''
   The hotel has distributed circulars saying the staff and
management will stay the same, although it has been bought by
Egyptians for $37 million.
   Other details being negotiated Tuesday were passes for Israeli
guests and 24-hour access to Taba, a 15-minute drive from the
Israeli resort town of Eilat.
   On Tuesday, Western tourists, Israelis and Egyptian workers
climbed atop a rocky hill overlooking the Red Sea that offers a view
of Egypt, the tip of Israel and Jordan.
   Samer Abdi Shahed, a 23-year-old Cairo native taking a break from
putting up a new flagpole, looked out from the hill. ``Every piece
of the land of Egypt is part of my heart,'' he said.
   A 25-year-old Israeli woman, who identified herself only as Irit,
heard his comment and declared the land should be Israel's because
``all that is here was built by Israelis.''
   Another Israeli, David Biton, 32, said he was reluctant to leave
Taba. He has been living on the beach and his 10-month-old daughter,
named Taba, was born here.
   He said he put up a tent on the hill, but police made him take it
down. So he painted ``Love Taba'' in red paint on the rocks.

<HEAD>Government Unveils Budget Stessing High Interest to Fight Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Conservative government set aside its
tax-reforming zeal Tuesday and unveiled a budget more cautious than
expected, underscoring its commitment to combat inflation with high
interest rates.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in the House
of Commons the government will leave income tax rates unchanged in
the fiscal year beginning April 1.
   He also projected a $24 billion surplus, much larger than
expected.
   ``Provided we stand firm on our resolves against inflation, the
prospects before us are excellent,'' Lawson said.
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, condemned the
budget as ``a botched attempt to make up for the chancellor's
excesses and messes of last year.''
   Last March, Lawson slashed Britain's income tax rates by cutting
the top band from 60 percent to 40 percent and reducing the basic
rate from 27 percent to 25 percent.
   The cuts spurred Britain's strong spending boom and worsened its
trade deficit, which widened to $3.63 billion in January from $3.04
billion in December.
   Inflation increased from an annual rate of 3.3 percent to 7.5
percent.
   This prompted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government to
push the commercial banks' base interest rates to 13 percent from a
low of 7.5 percent in June.
   Economists were expecting Lawson to tread carefully Tuesday, and
he was more restrained than expected.
   The budget requires approval from Parliament, which is assured by
the Conservative Party's large majority.
   Under Britain's budgetary process, the chancellor announces how
the government will raise revenue in his spring statement. In an
autumn statement, he details the spending plans.
   Lawson said he would raise in line with inflation allowances on
personal income taxes and the thresholds at which taxpayers begin
making payments.
   Market forecasts had called for these limits to be increased at a
rate significantly higher than inflation.
   Lawson also eased the burden on employees for contributions to
National Insurance, which pays for social services, and simplified
the system. In addition, he eased taxes on small businesses,
investors in so-called Personal Equity Plans which invest in British
stocks, and on unleaded gasoline. But he increased taxes on company
cars.
   The tax measures will reduce revenue in fiscal 1990 by less than
$3.4 billion, the chancellor said.
   He said Britain will have a budget surplus of $24 billion in the
new year, matching its surplus in the current year. Forecasts had
predicted the surplus would be about $5.2 billion.
   Lawson said he expects Britain's economic growth to slow to 2.5
percent this year, following 4.5 percent growth in 1988.
   He said ``some slowdown in growth is inevitable as we get
inflation back onto a downward path. Indeed it has almost certainly
already begun to happen.''
   Lawson said he expects the annual inflation rate to increase to 8
percent over the next few months, then fall to 5.5 percent by the
fourth quarter, and to 4.5 percent in the second quarter of 1990.
   ``Interest (rates) will stay as is needed or as long as is needed
for there will be no letting up on our determination to get on top
of inflation,'' Lawson said.
   ``However unwelcome high interest rates must be, they are
preferable to the damage done by high inflation,'' Lawson said.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty years ago Wednesday Nazi
troops invaded Czechoslovakia in what one historian says was an
unavoidable consequence of the West's abandonment of the nation and
Adolf Hitler's plan to conquer Europe.
   In September 1938, Czechoslovakia's allies Britain and France
bowed to German pressure and agreed to Hitler's annexation of
Czechoslovakia's German-speaking Sudetenland region, nearly
one-third of the nation's territory.
   Any Western hopes that appeasement would dissuade Hitler from
all-out war on eastern Europe ended Germany invaded the rest of
Czechoslovakia on March 15, 1939.
   Less than half a year later, Hitler's army rolled across Polish
borders, and World War II began.
   The Czechoslovak invasion was inevitable, independent historian
Milos Hajek said in an interview.
   ``Hitler's intentions were quite clear'' after the annexation, he
said. ``The strategy of (the Czech) government was to make maximum
concessions to Hitler, but even that didn't pay off.''
   Another Czech, a 25-year-old left-wing student at the time, said:
``The greatest mistake was that they (Prague leaders) believed in
the West, which proved to be so weak.''
   When Germany swallowed Austria on March 12, 1938, hundreds of
thousands feted the arriving troops.
   In Prague and other Czech towns, none cheered.
   Witnesses in Prague recalled that citizens retreated to side
streets to hide their shame and disgust. Others confronted the
invaders with clenched fists and shouted abuse.
   ``I remember the weather was awful _ sleet and rain _ and I can
still see the German bombers hovering above Prague, which was quite
a feat in those days with that kind of weather,'' said the former
student, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``I said to myself, what would it be like if there was war today.
This must perhaps be better,'' he added.
   The last meeting of the Czechoslovak government in Prague was
held on March 9, 1939. State President Emil Hacha ordered the ouster
of the Slovak government after its dissident leaders negotiated with
German and Austrian Nazis.
   A day later, Hitler decided to invade, and German troops were
ordered to take up positions by the evening of March 12.
   After the Czechoslovak government received word of Hitler's plan,
Hacha and Foreign Minister Frantisek Chvalkovsky traveled to Berlin
late on March 14. They met with Hitler, who told them their homeland
would be invaded.
   Hacha suffered a fainting attack after the meeting. A short time
later, he and Chvalkovsky signed a document imposed on them by
Hitler.
   ``The Czechoslovak state president has declared that he .... lays
the fate of the Czech people and country trustfully into the hands
of the Fuehrer of the German Reich,'' it said.
   When Nazi troops had taken over Czechoslovakia, an ecstatic
Hitler ordered his two secretaries: ``Now, you kids give me a kiss
here and here,'' pointing to his cheeks, one of the women later
recalled.

   Defense Secretary-designate Dick Cheney said
today he supports a two-year defense budget, a stance applauded by
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn as hearings opened
on Cheney's nomination.
   ``My preference is long-range,'' Cheney told the committee, whose
members voiced praise for his nomination.
   Nunn, D-Ga., said he hoped that when Cheney expresses his support
for a two-year defense budget in talks with Bush administration
officials, he ``wins that argument.''
   The hearing opened with introductions from Sen. Malcolm Wallop,
R-Wyo., a member of the armed services panel, who said Cheney's
``sense of humility and a sense of presence served him well and will
serve America well.''
   Senate Republican Whip Alan Simpson, also of Wyoming, called
Cheney ``the most steady and unflappable man I have ever known and
he will need it all.''
   Bush announced Friday that Cheney would be his nominee for the
Pentagon post, one day after the Senate rejected John Tower, a
former Texas senator, by a 53-47 vote.
   The vote capped a bitter, partisan debate in the Senate where
lawmakers expressed concerns over allegations of excessive drinking
and womanizing against Tower and his work as a paid defense
consultant after government service.
   Nunn is one of the chief supporters of a two-year budget for the
Pentagon _ instead of the present one-year practice _ which he
contends would provide more stability in defense spending and allow
Defense Department managers to spend money more efficiently and cut
costs.
   The two-year budget plan has been supported by top Pentagon
officials and congressional leaders for several years, but has not
yet been approved by administration and congressional budget
managers.
   Cheney lacks Tower's defense experience, but his background as
former President Ford's White House chief of staff for 14 months and
reputation as a compromiser places him in good standing.
   ``I think Dick Cheney knows what one needs to know when one takes
over that post,'' said Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston of
California. ``He will learn a lot more detail now. He is well aware
of the broad concepts and as chief of staff at the White House he
had to know a great deal about national defense matters.''
   Cheney is a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence
and the ranking Republican on the panel's program and budget
authorization subcommittee.
   The six-term congressman has supported the MX missile; funding
for Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as Star
Wars; production of new chemical weapons; and passage of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, the U.S.-Soviet pact
eliminating medium- and short-range missiles.
   But his comments in May 1984 raise questions about whether Cheney
will support the MX, which is favored by national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft, over the single-warhead Midgetman, which Democrats
in Congress have backed.
   ``I, too, think we should pursue the concept of small, mobile,
single-warhead missiles'' like the Midgetman, Cheney said. ``But I
am a skeptic because I question whether or not this House will ever
be prepared to vote to deploy the Midgetman.''
   On the issue of Pentagon reform, Cheney has been a member of the
Military Reform Caucus, an informal, bipartisan organization of
House and Senate members who have tried to change the way the
Defense Department does business.
   In 1985, Cheney voted for limits on ``revolving door'' job
switches from the Pentagon to private military supply companies, and
for legislation requiring the Pentagon to maintain records of
contractors' proposed and negotiated cost and pricing data. Both
measures won approval by lopsided margins.
   His voting record in favor of Reagan's proposals won Cheney a 100
percent score from the conservative American Security Council and a
zero rating from the Council for a Livable World, a pro-disarmament
group.
   To date, Cheney has already supported one idea that many members
of Congress favor _ a detailed national security strategy.
   In 1986, Cheney, Rep. Bob McEwen, R-Ohio, and Sen. John Warner of
Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee,
sponsored what they referred to as ``the national strategy act.''
   The measure called for the administration to provide along with
the annual budget message ``a comprehensive written report on the
national security strategy of the United States,'' including the
country's ``vital interests, goals and objectives,'' and ``the
foreign policy, worldwide commitments and national defense
capabilities ... necessary to deter aggression.''

<HEAD>East Germany Blames West German Industry for Mining-Related Quake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany charged Tuesday that West German
mining activities may have contributed to a severe earthquake that
rocked East German border towns. But it also said its own miners may
be at fault.
   The 12-second temblor Monday afternoon injured seven people and
damaged 200 East German homes along the two Germanys' border, said
East Germany's state news agency, ADN.
   It suggested a blast at Merkers potash mine on the East German
side of the border caused a cave-in and shifting of underground rock
formations that touched off the earthquake.
   But ADN also said West German potash operations just across the
border may have ``created the seismic tension conditions'' that made
the tremor possible by pumping waste water that seeped into East
German mineshafts.
   ADN also said ``faults among mine officials'' on the East German
side, or ``insufficient scientific knowledge'' about previously
unused mining fields ``could not be excluded.''
   The agency said experts believe waste water from the West German
potash operations was the ``main cause'' of a cave-in and shifting
of rock formations that set off the quake.
   West German officials could not be reached to comment on the
charge Tuesday night.
   Both sides of the German frontier were struck by the temblor, but
East Germany apparently bore the brunt.
   Some of the injured were struck by falling chimney bricks, it
said.
   The quake sent children fleeing from their schools and forced
miners to spend two hours underground until the danger was over, ADN
reported. No miners were hurt.
   ``I had the feeling that everything was falling apart'' the
agency quoted Voelkershausen Mayor Herbert Hermann as saying. ``I
watched as cracks formed on my walls and plaster fell from the
ceiling. All I could think of was opening a window and getting out
of there.''
   Voelkershausen, 130 miles southwest of Leipzig and six miles from
the West German border, was hardest-hit of the East German border
communities. The quake knocked out electricity and water services
and badly damaged 80 percent of homes of the 1,350 townspeople, ADN
reported.
   ``Residents were evacuated from 15 homes that are no longer
inhabitable, and were taken in by neighbors and relatives,'' ADN
said.
   The news agency said miners detonated controlled explosions in
the mine at 2:01 p.m. Monday.
   A large mining field caved in when the earthquake began, it said,
but miners were working about 2,000 feet beneath the earth and were
protected by special steel-encased chambers they use during
underground blasting.
   ``Even as the severe tremor was occurring above them, their lives
and health were never in danger,'' ADN reported.
   The miners returned to the surface after about two hours, the
agency said.
   It did not say how many miners were underground at the time or
whether there were any difficulties getting them out.
   West German authorities said the earthquake registered 5.7 on the
Richter scale, while ADN put the magnitude at 5.5. Such a quake can
cause considerable damage.
   Bruce Presgrave of the U.S. Geological Survey in Boulder, Colo.,
said his office received reports the quake may have originated in a
rockburst, which occurs when rocks under pressure suddenly fail.
Such events often happen in mining areas.
   According to the survey's files, the quake was one of the largest
on record in that part of Germany. The largest previous quake
occurred Feb. 22, 1953 and measured 5.4, it said.

<HEAD>Iran and Iraq Exchange Accusations of Cease-Fire Violations</HEAD>

   Iran said Tuesday it was ready to resume
stalled peace talks with Iraq next month, but the two countries
exchanged accusations of cease-fire violations.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iraqi troops
violated the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire by shelling Iranian positions
in three cities across the southern border starting late Monday
night.
   An Iraqi military spokesman said the Iranians shelled the
positions of an infantry division in the southern port city of
Basra, official Baghdad radio reported.
   The radio said the U.N. observers did not comment on the
incident, but they confirmed an Iraqi complaint had been registered.
   IRNA, which is monitored in Nicosia, quoted a military official
as saying five Iranian soldiers were wounded during the Iraqi
bombardment of the southern cities of Shalamcheh, Abadan and
Khorramshahr.
   IRNA accused the Iraqis of starting the latest border clash and
said the shelling of the port cities of Khorramshahr and Abadan
Tuesday afternoon created panic among personnel of the U.N.
Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group.
   ``Although the Iraqi troops initiated the clash, they contacted
the UNIIMOG eight times appealing for an end to the fire exchange,''
IRNA quoted the military official as saying.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, meanwhile, proposed
resuming peace talks with Iraq in the third week of April ``to show
our goodwill,'' IRNA reported.
   ``I stress again that at this moment there is nothing more
important than the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Iranian
territory,'' Velayati said in an interview with the agency.
   ``Until the withdrawal takes place, there will be no progress in
the talks,'' he said.
   The U.N.-sponsored peace talks in the eight-year Persian Gulf war
began five days after a U.N.-mediated cease-fire took effect last
Aug. 20.
   But the talks broke down immediately over the issue of Iraqi
troop withdrawals and the status of the Shatt Al-Arab waterway.
   Three further rounds of talks failed to break the deadlock.
   U.N. special envoy Jan Eliasson held separate meetings in New
York last week with Velayati and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz,
on resuming talks.
   The two belligerents agreed in January to form a joint military
group to help U.N. observers supervise the cease-fire agreement, but
the group has failed to meet ever since.
   Iran claimed last week that Iraqi forces hold a total of 1,028
square miles of Iranian territory.
   According to United Nations estimates, Iraqi troops still occupy
about 260 square miles of Iranian territory.
   ``I have asked the (U.N.) Secretary-General (Javier Perez de
Cuellar) to deal seriously with this issue,'' Velayati said.
   Velayati insists that as the next step in implementing the U.N.
Security Council peace plan contained in the 1987 resolution, Iraq
should withdraw to the border recognized in a 1975 treaty between
the two neighbors.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein abrogated that treaty in 1980,
just before Iraqi troops pushed across the border after weeks of
clashes between patrolling soldiers.
   Iraq argues that Iran's revolutionary government under Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini disavowed all previous treaties and the 1975
treaty no longer is in effect.
   Iran says it never relinquished the treaty. Under international
law, a treaty is valid unless all parties agree to a change.
   In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, Islamic foreign ministers met
Tuesday to arrange a swap of prisoners between Iran and Iraq and
discuss ways to revive peace talks between the longtime foes,
sources said.
   The ministers, meeting under the auspices of the 46-member
Organization of Islamic Conference, also planned to discuss postwar
reconstruction projects in the Persian Gulf nations.

<HEAD>Slayer Seeks New Trial in 25-Year-Old Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winston Moseley, convicted of stabbing Kitty
Genovese to death while 38 of her neighbors listened but did nothing
to help her, sought a new trial on the 25th anniversary of the
slaying.
   Moseley, 54, is serving a life term for the March 13, 1964
murder. He maintained in court papers that he did not receive a fair
trial because his lawyer was representing Miss Genovese in another
matter at the time of her death, according to Dick Piperno, a
spokesman for Queens District Attorney John Santucci.
   A hearing on Moseley's motion was scheduled April 6 in state
Supreme Court. Moseley prepared the case himself and filed the
papers in recent weeks, Piperno said.
   The district attorney's reply has not been prepared yet, but it
was expected the motion would be opposed.
   The story of Miss Genovese's murder received wide attention as a
symbol of urban apathy and an indictment of people who play deaf
because they are afraid to get involved.
   The victim, a 28-year-old bar manager, was stalked for half an
hour as she walked home from work. Her screams roused 38 people from
their beds, but no one helped or even called police.
   Moseley, arrested later for a burglary, admitted killing Miss
Genovese and was tried in June 1964.
   He said in his motion that his court-appointed lawyer, Sidney
Sparrow, did not disclose that he had represented Miss Genovese in
an appeal of a bookmaking conviction.
   Moseley said Sparrow's silence about a conflict of interest
warranted a new trial.
   Sparrow, 76 and still practicing law, said he was certain he had
told both Moseley and the trial judge of his prior connection with
the victim. He also said his representation of the woman ended with
her death.
   Moseley was condemned to death but the sentence was changed to 20
years to life on appeal. Three applications for parole since 1984
have been denied.

   An Army laboratory has identified the remains
of six American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, the
Pentagon said Tuesday.
   Five of the six were identified by the Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Honolulu after the remains were
repatriated to the United States by Vietnam last November and
December, the Pentagon said in a statement.
   The remains of the sixth were recovered in December during a
joint excavation at an air crash site in Savannakhet province of
southern Laos, the Pentagon added.
   All six of the servicemen were aviators. The Pentagon said the
family of one had asked that his name not be released and that he be
interred at the Punchbowl National Cemetery in Honolulu.
   The remaining five will be flown on Wednesday from Hickam Air
Force Base, Hawaii, to Travis Air Force Base, Calif., the Pentagon
said.
   It identified those five as:

   _Cmdr. Gene A. Smith of the Navy, born April 18, 1933, lost over
North Vietnam June 27, 1966. His home of record was listed as Salt
Lake City, Utah.
   _Maj. Sam G. Cordova of the Marine Corps, born Aug. 27, 1943,
lost over Laos Aug. 26, 1972. His home of record was listed as
Huntington Beach, Calif.
   _Lt. Cmdr. Frederick J. Fortner of the Naval Reserve, born May
15, 1943, lost over North Vietnam Oct. 17, 1967. His home of record
was listed as Pomona, Calif.
   _Lt. Cmdr. Michael W. Wallace of the Navy, born Sept. 12, 1936,
lost over Laos March 28, 1968. His home of record was listed as Salt
Lake City.
   _Airman 1st Class James E. Pleiman of the Air Force, born Jan.
15, 1944, lost over North Vietnam March 14, 1966. His home of record
was listed as Russia, Ohio.
   The Pentagon said Wallace's remains were recovered during the
joint excavation in Laos. Fortner's remains were among 23
repatriated by Vietnam on Nov. 3, and the others were among 38
repatriated by the Vietnamese on Dec. 15, 1988.
   The Pentagon added it was not surprised that Cordova's remains
were among a group repatriated by Vietnam even though he was shot
down over Laos.
   ``Maj. Cordova was lost in an area of Laos close to the
Vietnamese border, and in an area controlled by the North Vietnamese
at the time,'' the Pentagon said.
   With the latest identifications, 2,371 Americans continue to be
listed as missing in Indochina as a result of the Vietnam war, of
whom 1,737 are listed as missing in Vietnam, 545 in Laos, 83 in
Cambodia and six in China.
   All told, the remains of 182 Americans have been repatriated to
the United States from Vietnam and subsequently identified by the
Army lab since the end of the war. An additional 28 have been
identified after recovery from Laos and two after recovery from
China.
   ``The U.S. government appreciates the cooperation of the
Vietnamese and Lao governments that resulted in the accounting for
these Americans and hopes that unilateral turnover of information
and remains along with joint investigative efforts will continue and
increase,'' the Pentagon said in its statement.

<HEAD>Emotional McFarlane Asked About Letter He Wrote Before Suicide Try</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 11 grafs with later testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane, his face red and his eyes filling with tears, lashed out
at the prosecutor in the Oliver North trial Tuesday when asked about
a letter he wrote Congress on the day before he tried to commit
suicide.
   The first openly emotional moment at the North trial, now in its
second month, was triggered by chief prosecutor John Keker who
suggested to McFarlane that his Feb. 8, 1987, letter to Rep. Lee
Hamilton, D-Ind., was ``just complete nonsense.''
   ``Well, Mr. Keker, if I had sat down in my state of mind the day
before I tried to take my life, if I had tried to parse every last
dime that went to the Contras, it probably would have come out
different,'' McFarlane retorted.
   In the letter, McFarlane told Hamilton, then chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee, that a foreigner had offered in a May
1984 meeting with him to contribute money to the Nicaraguan Contras
and that the amount eventually donated was $5 million or less.
   McFarlane had known for two years that the offer came from the
government of Saudi Arabia through its ambassador and that the
country donated $32 million to the Contras starting in 1984.
   But McFarlane testified he had wanted to be sure the committee
had the full facts about the contribution. Speaking rapidly, he said:
   ``You're quite right. If I had taken the time, it probably would
have come out differently. In my state of mind at the time, if I had
really taken the time to tote it up, it would have toted up far
more.''
   Glaring at Keker, he said, ``If that's your point, you're right,
I'm dead wrong. I knew darn well it was something close to a million
dollars a month. ... I was acknowledging my participation in a
third-country donation. And I wanted that on the record.''
   When Keker pointed out that the letter claimed the money was from
the foreigner's own wealth and ``not from any government'',
McFarlane replied: ``That is a gloss, but that is what he (the Saudi
ambassador) told me.''
   While Keker was asking questions, defense attorney Brendan
Sullivan often interposed objections. When it came Sullivan's turn
to interrogate McFarlane, Keker turned the tables and the two argued.
   ``Calm down, both of you,'' said U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell.
   McFarlane's testimony, devoted mostly to aid given to the Contras
at a time when it was forbidden by U.S. law, also touched on the
revelation that money from the sale of arms to Iran had been
diverted to the Contra cause.
   Testifying about the events in late 1986 when details were
emerging, McFarlane said North told him on the night of Nov. 18 that
government lawyers ``believed there might be a problem'' with a
shipment of 18 U.S. Hawk antiaircraft missiles from Israel to Iran a
year earlier. He had gone to North's office because the aide asked
for his help in preparing a chronology for investigators and for a
statement then-President Reagan was to deliver the next night at a
news conference.
   The Central Intelligence Agency had helped arrange the missile
shipment and the prossible problem was ``whether or not the
involvement of the CIA was appropriate ... or properly executed,''
McFarlane said.
   According to North, ``he and I hadn't learned of this shipment
until later on. ... He wasn't certain about it,'' McFarlane said,
adding that at the time other American officials believed the
material being shipped was oil-drilling equipment.
   McFarlane had been told about the shipment in November 1985 when
he was in Geneva but said that a year later ``I had no clear
recollection'' of it and thus used North's comments as the basis for
the chronology.
   One of the accusations against North is that he obstructed
Congress by saying in the final version of the chronology that no
one in the U.S. government learned before January 1986 that Hawk
missiles had been shipped to Iran in November 1985.
   McFarlane also testified that on a car ride to the White House on
Nov. 21, 1986, North said ``we're going to have a shredding party.''
He agreed with Keker that North probably referred to hundreds of
documents, including memos spelling out North's involvement in the
Contra aid efforts.
   McFarlane agreed under cross-examination by Sullivan that North
wrote only two paragraphs of a Sept. 5, 1985, letter to Hamilton _ a
letter in connection with which North is accused of making false
statements to Congress.
   But he also said much of North's thinking _ as submitted to
McFarlane in a draft of the letter _ was incorporated in the final
version.
   The draft said that National Security Council staffers did not
solicit funds or other support for the Contras and didn't offer
tactical advice to the Contras.
   McFarlane also testified that he didn't know whether North
prepared a subsequent letter to then-Rep. Michael Barnes for which
North also is accused of making false statements to Congress.
   McFarlane pleaded guilty to withholding information from Congress
in connection with the letter to Barnes.
   ``Did you know they are charging Ollie North'' in connection with
the Barnes letter? asked Sullivan.
   ``No,'' responded McFarlane.
   ``All you know is that you wrote it?''
   ``Yes.''
   Sullivan also brought out that North proposed letters to Congress
saying that executive privilege was being invoked and that the NSC
would not turn over documents that Barnes was requesting on North's
Contra-related activities.
   McFarlane said he had an NSC lawyer consult with the White House
counsel's office, which rejected North's idea. Sullivan brought up
the matter to suggest that North wanted to refuse to respond to
Congress rather than provide it with information that might be wrong.

<HEAD>Faulty Warning Light Triggers Precautionary Landing In Dallas Suburb</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A faulty engine-fire warning light
prompted the pilot of a Delta Air Lines flight carrying 93 people to
make an emergency landing at a municipal airport east of Dallas,
officials said.
   No fire was found on the Boeing 727, and the 86 passengers and
seven crew members were uninjured, Delta spokesmen said.
   Passengers of Flight 423, flying from Atlanta to San Diego,
safely slid down the plane's chutes and were taken by chartered bus
65 miles to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to board another
plane.
   The pilot told passengers he was landing at Majors Field in
Greenville, a former World War II Army Air Corps training field.
   ``We came down a little quicker than usual,'' said passenger Gene
Odom of Savannah, Ga. ``It's an inconvenience, but it's better than
being scattered all over a field someplace.''
   Inspectors found an air duct leak in one engine but no sign of
fire, said Gerrie Cook, a Federal Aviation Administration
spokeswoman in Fort Worth.
   Delta spokesman John Clower said two mechanics who happened to be
on the flight diagnosed the problem as a faulty warning light.
   The defense electronics contractor E-Systems Inc. is the primary
user of the airport. Only one runway, more than 8,000 feet long, is
in use and routinely handles planes as large as Boeing 747s, which
E-Systems modifies for military and other specialized uses.
   E-Systems also regularly services the president's Air Force One.

<TEXT>
   Air Force investigators are looking at
everything from weather to maintenance and weight to determine why a
helicopter crashed, and seem to have ruled out only night-vision
goggles, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   All 15 aboard died in Sunday night's crash in the desert 25 miles
northwest of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, where the helicopter had
stopped to refuel.
   Authorities said the main rotor shaft nut, a fastener about a
foot in diameter that holds the main rotor head to the helicopter
frame, had been replaced two days before the crash. Although that
wasn't thought to have been a factor in the crash, it wasn't ruled
out, officials said.
   Investigators have ``tried to look at all the different aspects,
all of the potential variables, things like weather, things like ...
maintenance, fuel,'' said Capt. Carlos Roque, a spokesman at
Davis-Monthan.
   Roque said the only possible cause that has been ruled out is the
use of controversial night-vision goggles, which have been an issue
in numerous military helicopter crashes.
   Officials have confirmed that when the CH-3E helicopter went down
in flames, its four crew members were wearing the light-amplifying
goggles as they ferried 11 Army Special Forces members from an Army
post southeast of Tucson to an Air Force gunnery range 124 miles
northwest.
   The soldiers, whose names were not released immediately, were
from Fort Bragg, N.C.
   Authorities at Davis-Monthan were gathering medical and dental
records of the 15 victims to aid in identification of the badly
burned bodies. A temporary morgue was set up in advance of the
arrival of a forensic team.
   Navy Cmdr. David Thomas in Washington said more than 300 CH-3Es
and similar helicopters belonging to the Air Force, Navy and Coast
Guard were grounded for a week that ended Friday to inspect the
rotor nut.
   Lt. Col. Darrel Hayes, an Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon,
said the nuts were considered potentially defective. He said the
helicopter that went down had been inspected Friday and its nut
replaced, and that it was flown safely three times before the crash.
   ``As we understand it, when they replaced the rotor nut, they had
done a flight test on it, then rechecked it, retorqued it. And it
has all sorts of special safety pins on it to keep it in place. And
then it had flown three times since then,'' Hayes said.
   ``So it wasn't as if it was something they just did and it
broke,'' Hayes added. He said that while maintenance always is an
issue in a crash, ``it just doesn't fit with what we know.''
   On Monday, officials at Davis-Monthan imposed an indefinite
restriction on the five remaining CH-3Es belonging to the 71st
Special Operations Command.
   ``At some point, they will be permitted to fly again, after
something is done, probably an inspection or a changeover of some
sort, or whatever the investigators recommend,'' Roque said. ``Right
now it's indefinite, but it's not permanent.''

<TEXT>
   South Korea began major joint military
maneuvers with the United States on Tuesday and charged that North
Korea was preparing for war.
   A Defense Ministry statement said the communist North was
fomenting anti-Americanism in South Korea to force out U.S. troops
as part of its plot to conquer the country.
   Villagers forced a military range used by U.S. fighter jets to
close for a second day Tuesday as about 200,000 South Korean and
U.S. troops, plus naval and air units, began 10 days of annual
military games codenamed Team Spirit.
   The demonstrators, protesting practice bombing by the jets,
hurled rocks and firebombs onto Koon-ni range, about 70 miles
southwest of Seoul, inflicting minor fire damage on three
guardhouses, a U.S. military spokesman said.
   The Defense Ministry statement rejected the North's charges that
Team Spirit exercises were preparations for a nuclear attack on the
North.
   South Korean defense officials said Tuesday the exercises are
defensive and pose no threat to the North.
   The Pyongyang regime put its armed forces on combat alert and
mobilized reserves, as it has done during previous exercises. It
warned on Monday that the maneuvers could trigger war.
   ``The tension between the North and the South has been screwed up
to the highest pitch, and a dangerous situation has been created on
the Korean peninsula in which a war may break out any moment,'' said
Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency.
   The South said, ``The North should immediately stop its
continuous military buildup and war preparations and clearly show
that it is giving up its strategy of communizing the South by
force.''
   South Korean officials said Pyongyang was trying to stir up
anti-American sentiment among some South Koreans to try to force
removal of the 42,000 U.S. troops based here under a mutual defense
treaty.
   ``We are compelled to point out ... the North's scheme to
heighten anti-Americanism and get American troops out and ...
eventually realize revolution to communize the South,'' the Defense
Ministry statement said.
   Some groups in the South, including dissidents, radical students
and farmers, have become increasingly anti-American because of U.S.
trade pressure, and they see the United States as having supported
authoritarian regimes.
   This year's Team Spirit involves about 70,000 American troops,
including the 42,000 stationed here and 27,000 from Hawaii, Okinawa
and the U.S. mainland, according to a U.S. military spokesman in
Seoul.
   Like the other U.S. military spokesman, he spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The North cited Team Spirit earlier as impeding North-South
talks, and those peace talks have been stalled.
   The peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
capitalist, pro-Western South Korea at the end of World War II, when
U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's colonial rule over the region.
The two Koreas have remained bitter enemies and fought a war from
1950-53.

<TEXT>
   Mexico is turning away truckloads of live hogs
at the border because the animals have not been vaccinated for a
disease eradicated in the United States, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen said
Tuesday.
   The Texas Democrat said the Mexican ban of U.S.-bred hogs was
imposed with litte or no warning, ``has no basis in scientific
fact,'' and may be based on ``mistaken information.''
   Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he was
asking U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter to negotiate an end to the problem.
Bentsen's office said Mexico began turning away U.S. hogs Friday.
   He said Mexico is barring the hog imports because the animals
have not been vaccinated for hog cholera, which has been eradicated
from the United States for over a decade.
   ``In fact, it is illegal under U.S. law to vaccinate hogs against
hog cholera, and since the hogs in question are market hogs destined
for slaughter, such a vaccination would be moot in any case,'' said
Bentsen.
   Pat El-Hinnaway, a spokeswoman at the Agriculture Department,
said the agency ``just received official notification from Mexico''
about the ban. ``We are in the process of translating it (from
Spanish) and analyzing it.''

<HEAD>Attorney Says Matheney Intends To Plead Insanity In Killing Of Ex-Wife</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS P. WYMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man charged with beating his former
wife to death while he was free during a brief furlough from prison
intends to plead insanity, his attorney told a judge Tuesday.
   The furlough program was suspended after the killing.
   Alan L. Matheney, 38, stood silently during the hearing in St.
Joseph Superior Court while his court-appointed attorney filed a
series of motions.
   For his protection, Matheney was transferred from the St. Joseph
County Jail, where he was assaulted March 6, to the Indiana State
Prison at Michigan City, said defense attorney Philip R. Skodinski.
The assault is under investigation.
   Judge Jeanne J. Swartz accepted the insanity notice and said she
would appoint two psychiatrists to examine Matheney and determine
his competency to stand trial June 19.
   Matheney's furlough raised a public furor, prompting Gov. Evan
Bayh to suspend the program and to order seven prison officials to
face disciplinary hearings.
   Matheney had been serving an eight-year sentence for beating his
ex-wife, Lisa M. Bianco, and criminally confining her two daughters.
   Ms. Bianco was beaten to death March 4 outside her Mishawaka home
by a man wielding an unloaded shotgun. She died of a massive skull
fracture, a coroner said.
   Prison officials failed to notify Ms. Bianco, 29, of Matheney's
release hours before the assault, despite her requests and
Matheney's continued hostility toward her, according to a Board of
Correction report released Monday.
   Prosecutor Michael P. Barnes said he would decide later this week
whether to seek the death penalty. Matheney also is charged with
burglary.
   At the hearing, Matheney asked the prosecutors for recordings of
telephone conversations between Ms. Bianco and Matheney made before
his imprisonment. Skodinski said he didn't know what information the
tapes contained but said they might help the defense.
   Chief Deputy Prosecutor John D. Krisor said the recordings
apparently were related to the 1987 battery case against Matheney.
Krisor said he did not know if the prosecutor's office had the tapes.
   Ms. Bianco had divorced Matheney in 1985 and last year became a
counselor for battered women at the Elkhart County Women's Shelter.
She also joined the Mishawaka Commission on the Status of Women.
   Hours before the slaying, officials at the Industrial
Correctional Complex at Pendleton gave Matheney an eight-hour
furlough to confer with an attorney in Indianapolis.
   Matheney should have been restricted to the Indianapolis area,
about 40 southwest of Pendleton and 160 miles south of Mishawaka,
but that condition did not appear on his furlough pass, according
the Correction Board report.
   Seven officials from the Department of Correction were ordered to
face disciplinary hearings after the report blamed bureaucratic
ineptitude and poor decision making for Matheney's release.

   Christian army units and Moslem militiamen
fought an artillery duel Tuesday that rained hundreds of shells on
Beirut's residential areas and killed at least 39 people, most of
them civilians.
   Police said 96 people were wounded in the worst fighting since
1985 in Lebanon's 14-year-old sectarian civil war, and most of the
casualties were in Moslem west Beirut. They said two children and
three Syrian soldiers were among the dead and four Lebanese soldiers
were wounded.
   The day-long battle between Christian forces and Walid Jumblatt's
Druse militia began as people were going to work, catching them by
surprise, and shells blasted cars to bits during rush hour.
   Schools sent children home. Merchants in the city's Moslem and
Christian sectors slammed down their shutters. Radios blared
warnings to stay indoors.
   ``It's moronic. They are the gardeners of violence,'' Fatima
Haidar, a teacher of English, said through the sound of artillery
fire while closing her secondary school in Moslem west Beirut's
Verdun district.
   ``May God chop off the hands of all leaders on both sides of the
capital! They are butchers!'' said a Sunni Moslem woman who gave her
name only as Fatima.
   Ships left port for open water. Aircraft flew to Cyprus to escape
shelling at the airport.
   Fighting began March 8, two days after Aoun impose a blockade on
illegal ports run by Moslem militias. Police gave total casualties
since as 45 dead and 128 wounded.
   The confrontation threatens efforts of Arab League mediators to
resolve a political crisis that created Christian and Moslem
governments and has split the army into sectarian commands.
   Gen. Michel Aoun, who leads a Christian military cabinet and
commands the 20,000 Christian troopers, said Tuesday: ``It's a war
of liberation against Syrian occupation forces. The battle has
begun.''
   Syria supports the Moslem government of Prime Minister Salim
Hoss. The Syrians have 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon, including Beirut,
and President Hafez Assad has become the nation's main power broker
in the chaos of civil war.
   In midafternoon, police said, Aoun's forces shelled the border
town of Chtaura, command headquarters for Syrian troops in east
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, and cut the Damascus-Beirut highway.
   Gen. Sami Khatib, chosen by Hoss to command the army's 22,000
Moslem soldiers, has kept out of the Christian-Druse battle. His
troops are poorly equipped and scattered throughout Lebanon's Moslem
territory, which generally covers west and south Beirut, south
Lebanon and coastal areas.
   Aoun accused the Syrians of starting the artillery duels between
his and Jumblatt's men Tuesday by shelling both Moslem and Christian
neighborhoods.
   In Damascus, the official daily Al-Baath said Aoun's accusations
were false, aimed aimed at ``devastating Syria's constructive role
in Lebanon.''
   Syrian sources said privately Aoun wanted to draw Syrian troops
into the fight but Assad did not want an armed clash.
   Speaking to reporters at the presidential palace at suburban
Baabda, in Christian territory five miles northeast of Beirut, Gen.
Aoun said: ``My government has decided to take all the necessary
measures to force the Syrian army to withdraw from Lebanon.''
   He said he asked the Arab League and its mediation committee to
``intervene at once to ensure the withdrawal of the Syrian
occupation army.''
   ``Lebanon cannot possibly stay on under the mercy of the Syrian
cannon,'' he said at the news conference, broadcast by Christian
radio and television stations.
   His office at the Defense Ministry, near the palace, was hit by
artillery fire. The television station run by Aoun's Christian
government said Syria fired on the ministry just before the news
conference in an attempt to ``assassinate him.''
   It showed Aoun's desk, which appeared demolished, and leather
chairs and metal filing cabinets covered with the rubble of
chandeliers and walls. Aoun was shown inspecting the wreckage and
said: ``It's not by chance that the office was shelled. Syria is a
terrorist country.''
   A howitzer salvo landed in a crowded street of west Beirut,
setting seven cars afire, said Associated Press photographer Ali
Mohammed.
   ``The charred body of one motorist was pulled by rescuers from
one car as pedestrians sprinted in panic for cover,'' he said.
   Dozens of smoldering cars littered the Aishe Bakkar, Mossaitbeh,
Noweiry and Ein Mreisseh districts of west Beirut and the
Ashrafiyeh, Dora, Hazmieh and Bourj Hammoud neighborhoods of the
Christian east, police said.
   A shell landed near a bakery where a line of people waited to buy
bread 200 yards from the prime minister's home. Another demolished a
sandwich kiosk outside a seaside restaurant in west Beirut's Rouche
district, a few yards from a Syrian army checkpoint.
   Several rounds struck near the Middle East Hospital, close to the
headquarters of the 12,000 Syrian soldiers who have taken charge of
security in west Beirut and the Shiite Moslem southern slums.
   Hoss accused Christian army gunners of shelling crowded
intersections in west Beirut and called for an end to ``this
shameful massacre, this new cycle of mad violence.''
   Police said shells hit the Beirut port; the Christian harbor of
Jounieh, 12 miles north of the capital, and the airport, which
opened Monday after a two-day closure because of the fighting.
   President Amin Gemayel chose Aoun to lead the government when his
own six-year term expired in September and conservative Christians
would not accept Syria's nominees to succeed him. Moslems then
pledged allegiance to Hoss.
   By tradition, Lebanon's president is Christian, the prime
minister Sunni Moslem and the parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.

   The government said Tuesday that social
tension caused by economic hardship could threaten agreements
reached in negotiations with the political opposition, which began
Feb. 6 and are nearing completion.
   ``The social effects of economic phenomena may be dangerous,''
government spokesman Jerzy Urban said. ``Inflation, difficulties in
acquiring goods and ... regulating incomes by strikes may undermine
the national agreements (and) evoke disturbances and crisis
situations.''
   Urban cited strikes led by ``extremist'' elements that briefly
idled four mines Tuesday in Jastrzebie. Last August, a nationwide
series of strikes that began in the southern city prompted
authorities to propose the talks on political and economic reform.
   Alojzy Pietrzyk of Jastrzebie, a Solidarity negotiator in the
talks, said the latest ``warning strikes'' were prompted by the
refusal of management to pay annual bonuses to workers who struck in
August.
   ``Solidarity has made frequent statements saying strikes are
unfavorable for the country at the moment,'' Pietrzyk said in a
statement. ``At the same time, we state that strikes can be avoided
only by reaching an agreement which would satisfy work forces at
mines and implementing it as soon as possible.''
   Government and opposition negotiators have agreed in principle to
restore legal status to the independent union Solidarity, the
farmers' union Rural Solidarity and the Independent Students'
Association. All were formed in 1980 and outlawed after martial law
was imposed in December 1981.
   Negotiators also have announced agreement on free elections to a
newly created Senate.
   Anger over low wages has led to several strikes in recent months,
but Urban said the frequency of strikes had declined in the past
week.
   Economic problems besetting Poland include annual inflation of at
least 60 percent and a foreign debt of more than $38 billion.
   Most stores are short of goods or stocked with items of poor
quality, so many Poles part with precious hard currency at state-run
dollar shops or make shopping trips abroad.
   ``Poland has to go through a difficult preliminary period in the
upcoming year of the transition stage. The economy will decide about
everything,'' Urban said.
   He said it appeared government estimates that 1989 inflation
would be kept to 20 percent were too optimistic and ``difficult,
revolutionary economic steps'' lie ahead.
   Under discussion at the talks is an opposition proposal on
indexing wages to inflation, which the government has said would
make matters worse.
   Urban said failure of the dialogue ``would be a historic tragedy
for the nation. ... The failure of this experiment would not only
destroy the hopes of Poles, but also Poland's position in the
world.''

   William J. Bennett, head of the national drug
control policy office, met with Mayor Marion Barry Jr. and other
city officials on Tuesday on ways for federal and local authorities
to fight drug-related problems that have contributed to a crime wave
in the nation's capital.
   ``It was a very good meeting,'' Barry said. ``We're just getting
to know each other in this area, and he and I agreed ... there will
be no quick fixes.''
   Bennett has said he would make solving the city's drug problem a
top priority. Thus far this year, 107 people have been slain in the
district, about twice as many as at this time last year. A record
372 people were killed in 1988. Place blame many of the murders on
drugs.
   Barry said he told Bennett that the city needs federal money to
build more jail facilities, expand drug treatment programs and put
more police on the street.
   The mayor maintained that Washington is a safe place to visit.
``There are certain parts of our city where these killings are
taking place, and there is not a `Wild West' here in Washington,''
Barry said. ``Conventioneers can come, tourists can come.''

<HEAD>Bush Promises Executive Order on Government Ethics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday he would issue a new
executive order spelling out ethical standards of conduct expected
of high-ranking government officials.
   Bush said that while he might not accept all of the changes
advocated by a presidential study panel, ``I will be moving quickly
to seek implementation of the great bulk of the commission's
recommendations.''
   After meeting privately with members of the commission headed by
former federal judge Malcolm Wilkey, Bush issued a statement saying
that ``upholding exacting ethical standards throughout the
government is extremely important to me and to all Americans.''
   He reiterated that he also will soon propose legislation.
   The House and Senate last year passed a bill aimed at attacking
the ``revolving-door'' problem in which people leave government
positions and then lobby the agencies where they used to work.
Then-President Reagan vetoed the bill, saying it would discourage
people from going into the service of their country.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
``certainly agrees'' with a commission recommendation that would
treat the executive office of the president as a single agency for
purposes of ethics rules. The aim of this change would be to stop
former White House employees from attempting to use their influence
as lobbyists with separate entities in the executive office complex.
   The standard presidential executive order on ethics has gone
unchanged since it was issued by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.

<HEAD>Government Requiring Approval of Foreign Airline Security Procedures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government adopted a rule Tuesday that will
require foreign airlines operating in the United States to have
security programs approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner told the Senate
transportation appropriations subcommittee that the new requirement
is aimed at making sure foreign carriers ``have adequate security
measures to protect civil aviation against criminal acts of
violence.''
   The rule was proposed by the government late last year, before
the Dec. 21 destruction of Pan American Flight 103 by a bomb over
Lockerbie, Scotland, which resulted in 270 deaths.
   American carriers are already required to have FAA-approved
security procedures.
   Under the new regulation, the 111 foreign airlines serving the
United States would have to submit their security procedures to the
FAA within 90 days of the rule's official publication in the Federal
Register. That is expected Thursday.
   The FAA is required to tell the carriers if their rules are
adequate within 30 days of receiving them. If they are judged
insufficient, the government could ultimately withdraw an airline's
permission to land in this country.
   Each carrier's security program will be required to be in place
within 180 days of the new rule's publication.

<HEAD>General Strike Grips Brazil But Millions Report For Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A nationwide general strike closed
schools and factories and halted public transportation Tuesday, but
millions of workers ignored union calls and went to their jobs.
Scattered violence was reported.
   The first day of the planned 48-hour strike fell short of the
union leaders' vow to ``stop all economic activity'' in major cities
in this nation of 144 million, Latin America's largest.
   Buses and taxis were stoned in some cities, and there were
reports of looting in Caxias, a suburb of Rio de Janeiro.
   The strike was called to protest a government-decreed wage
freeze. It was organized by Brazil's two largest labor movements _
the leftist Central Workers Union and more centrist General Workers
Central. Those federations say they represent 35 million of the
nation's 60 million workers in about 3,000 unions.
   Jair Meneguelli, president of the Central Workers Union, told a
news conference the strike was a huge success with at least 70
percent of the country's total work force staying off the job.
   But Carlos Henrique de Almeida Santos, President Jose Sarney's
press spokesman told reporters in Brasilia, ``The strike failed to
live up to the expectations of its organizers because it was not a
nationwide movement. There were isolated stoppages in many urban
centers but in no way could it be considered a general strike.
Everything indicates that tomorrow the strikes should fizzle out.''
   Tens of millions of commuters were stranded as many trains, buses
and subways stopped running.
   Army troops were posted outside the main station of Rio de
Janeiro's government-run commuter railroad which did not operate.
Rio has a population of 5 million and the trains normally carry
about one million passengers daily.
   Rio's subway system and the ferry service across Guanabara Bay
also were shut down.
   But the subway trains ran in Sao Paulo, South America's largest
city with 10 million people.
   Carlos Alberto Ferreira da Silva, a leader of the Sao Paulo
subway union, said the union was not adequately prepared for a
strike. He said 300 of the union's 9,000 workers attended a meeting
to respond to the strike call and they voted only to distribute a
letter expressing support of the strike.
   Airlines flew normal schedules and most supermarkets, gas
stations, shops and restaurants were open.
   The Federation of Industries of Sao Paulo State said more than 70
percent of the state's 2 million factory workers showed up at their
jobs.
   Several factories were reported shut down in the industrial
suburbs of Sao Paulo city _ the site of Brazil's foreign-owned auto
plants and union strongholds.
   Banks operated normally in most of the country but with reduced
personnel and fewer clients than usual, according to the National
Association of Banks.
   Many universities and public and private schools closed.
   Sao Paulo state security chief Luis Antonio Fleury Filho said
rock-throwing strikers damaged 95 buses and 30 people were arrested.
Buses also were stoned in Rio.
   Police used clubs to disperse crowds suspected of looting stores
in Caxias just outsice Rio and several people were detained. A
photographer of the Jornal do Brasil newspaper who was taking
pictures of the clashes was shot in the hand by a policeman,
according to the Jornal do Brasil radio station.
   In Belo Horizonte, the capital Minas Gerais state, police used
rubber truncheons and tear gas against groups of pro-strike
demonstrators and there also were street fights in Vitoria, capital
of Espirito Santo state. Brazil has 26 states.
   The strike is to protest the wage freeze that is part of the
government's ``Summer Plan'' announced in January to curb inflation
that was running at an annual rate of about 1,000 per cent. The plan
includes a price freeze.
   The plan brought inflation down from 28.7 per cent in December to
3.6 per cent for the first 11 days of February, according to the
latest government figures.
   Jair Meneguelli, president of the Central Workers Union, said the
wage freeze cut workers' purchasing power by up to 49 percent ``and
we want it back.''
   More than half of Brazilian workers earn less than $50 a week.

   Terrorist Fawaz Younis, lured to his arrest on
the high seas with promises of sex and drugs, was convicted Tuesday
in U.S. District Court of hijacking a Jordanian airliner in Beirut
and holding 70 people hostage for 30 hours.
   Federal officials immediately claimed the verdict as the first
affirmation of a 1984 statute asserting for the United States
``long-arm'' jurisdiction over the taking of American hostages
aboard.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh hailed the verdict as ``a boost
for our efforts to effectively deal with international terrorism.''
   ``Those who violate the rights of U.S. citizens are hereby put on
notice that the American law enforcement system is capable of
exacting a penalty for these terroristic crimes, regardless of where
they occur,'' Thornburgh said in a statement.
   The Lebanese Younis, bearded and with black hair, showed no
emotion as a female interpreter relayed the verdict the jury reached
after three days of deliberations: Guilty on three counts, innocent
on three others.
   While the jury of seven women and five men filed out of the
courtroom, Younis chatted with the Arabic interpretor, and appeared
relaxed and smiling.
   For his conviction on the most serious offense, taking hostages,
the 30-year-old Younis could be sentenced to life in prison.
   ``This case demonstrates the determination of the United States
government to bring to justice in the United States international
terrorists who victimize U.S. citizens wherever violence and
hostage-taking acts are committed,'' U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens
said in a statement.
   Younis' court-appointed attorney, Francis D. Carter, contested
the government claim and said he would appeal the conviction on
grounds that the United States ought not to have jurisdiction over
the 1985 hijacking. He said he also would appeal on grounds the
military was involved in the arrest.
   ``It is an outrage,'' said Carter. The case ``was not about the
United States'' and the two Americans aboard the aircraft were not
harmed.
   Younis was lured aboard a yacht in international waters in the
Mediterranean Sea on Sept. 13, 1987, with the prospect of a drug
deal and a party.
   He was slammed to the deck by members of the FBI hostage rescue
squad and interrogated for four days aboard a Navy munitions ship.
Then, after he gave a detailed confession, he was flown non-stop
from the deck of an aircraft carrier to Washington.
   Doctors later found he had suffered hairline fractures of both
wrists during the arrest. But during his interrogation, the swelling
was treated only with bags of ice.
   ``Mr. Younis did not expect an awful lot from the United States
after the means used to arrest him,'' Carter said.
   ``I tried to prepare him and told him that an American jury was
probably not likely for an acquittal in this case,'' Carter said.
``He was not too hopeful.''
   ``He was happy that on three counts, he was found not guilty, and
those three counts were the horribles,'' harming or threatening
passengers, destroying an aircraft, and carrying weapons aboard an
aircraft, said Carter.
   Younis was convicted on these counts:
   _Seizing hostages, with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
   _Conspiracy to commit sky piracy, with a maximum sentence of five
years.
   _Hijacking a commercial airliner, with a maximum 20 years in
prison.
   He was found innocent on these counts:
   _Using or threatening violence against passengers or crew members
of a commercial airliner.
   _Destroying a civilian aircraft.
   _Carrying aboard a civilian aircraft devices likely to damage it.
   Carter had argued that Younis should be acquitted because he
hijacked the aircraft under orders from Lebanon's Amal militia, a
Shiite Moslem group to which he had belonged since 1979.
   Younis testified that he knew hijacking a civilian airliner was
illegal, but said Amal was at war.
   But he acknowledged under cross-examination that Amal was not at
war with any of the passengers or crew, with Royal Jordanian
Airlines or the government of Jordan.
   Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr., instructed the jury that
``Hijacking a plane is illegal. ... Obeying illegal orders ... is
not a defense.''
   To find the defendant innocent on grounds that he was obeying
orders, said Robinson, the jury would have to conclude he did not
know hijacking was illegal.
   A federal appeals court has already ruled the arrest of Younis,
while not a model of law enforcement, was acceptable and that the
confession could be used in court against him.
   Carter said he expected the the judge to issue a sentence in 30
to 45 days, and said that he would be reviewing the record of the
trial to determine whether there were further gounds for appeal.
   A federal appeals court has already ruled that the arrest, while
not a model of law enforcement, was acceptable and that a written
confession signed by Younis could be used against him, closing that
avenue of appeal.
   During the trial, five eyewitnesses identified Younis as the
leader of the hijacking. Prosecutors played a videotape of him at
the end of the incident, announcing that the hijackers planned to
destroy the aircraft.

<HEAD>Conflicting Signals on Contra Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration sent conflicting
signals Tuesday about the amount of non-military aid it will seek to
keep the Nicaraguan Contra rebels afloat until a peace agreement is
carried out.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said a total of $40
million to $50 million, quoted in news stories this week, is ``in
the ballpark'' of what President Bush wants to follow after the
current $27 million package expires March 31.
   But on Capitol Hill, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
that figure is ``not an accurate number as far as I'm concerned.''
   Baker commented on the Contras at a budget hearing before the
House Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee.
   Later, Fitzwater later said he agreed with Baker, and that his
comment about the numbers being in the ballpark merely reflected
that ``It's a big ballpark,'' encompassing all figures.
   Fitzwater said no final decision has been made on Bush's proposal
``and we are not setting artificial timetables for decisions.''
   Baker and Fitzwater agreed a money request will be sent to
Congress for non-lethal assistance to the Contra forces. That are
about 11,000 Contras in camps on the Honduras side of the border
with leftist-ruled Nicaragua.
   Rebel leader Adolfo Calero said administration officials told him
the aid request would be in the neighborhood of $40 million, which
would be intended to see the rebels into early 1990, when Nicaraguan
national elections are to occur.
   Fitzwater reiterated the administration's intent for a diplomatic
solution, and said Bush's plan would include ``the ideas of
incentives and disincentives that might go with that.''
   ``In this approach we are also pursuing the building of a
bipartisan support for whatever policy emerges,'' he said, in
highlighting the administration's wish to work out some kind of aid
package that can make it through the Democratic-controlled Congress.
Contra aid has been a highly contentious issue for six years.
   Fitzwater also acknowledged that a key factor will be the
cooperation of Honduras in allowing the Contras to keep their camps.
   He noted that Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt visited
Honduran President Jose Azcona on Monday to discuss the situation
and U.S. policy.
   A delegation of Honduran officials, breaking a ban on talks with
the Contras, met with Calero and a group of rebel leaders in
Washington on Monday.
   Afterward, the Hondurans were uncustomarily conciliatory in
comments about the Contras, declining to repeat previous Honduran
demands that the rebels be expelled from Honduran territory.
   Baker said the effort to maintain the anti-Sandinista Contras in
place represents ``a genuine view that they do represent somewhat of
an incentive for the Sandinista government to keep the promises they
haven't kept in the past,'' including steps toward democratization
and civil liberties, he said.
   The five Central American presidents agreed last month in El
Salvador to construct a plan by this spring for the disbanding of
the rebels in exchange for democratic reforms in Nicaragua.
   Administration officials have said their concern is to keep the
Contras in place until it can be assured the Sandinistas will keep
their pledges regarding democracy moves.
   U.S. officials have said Bush is prepared to ease the U.S. trade
embargo against Nicaragua and take a number of other conciliatory
measures if the Sandinistas show they are serious about holding fair
elections next year.
   Under such circumstances, the administration also would be
prepared to upgrade diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, including
the exchange of ambassadors, the officials said.
   The administration has prepared a list of about 20 incentives for
Nicaragua, as well as a potential list of punitive measures of
similar length if Nicaraguan opposition forces are not given what
U.S. officials perceive to be an equal chance in the balloting.

   A Supreme Court justice Tuesday refused to let
a strike against Eastern Airlines spread to a Philadelphia-area
commuter railroad that carries 90,000 passengers a day.
   Justice William J. Brennan left intact a court order blocking a
sympathy strike by the railroad workers in support of the Machinists
union strike against Eastern.
   Brennan rejected a request by rail unions seeking to strike the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA).
   He said the rail unions failed to establish that there is a
reasonable probability four justices on the high court would vote to
hear arguments in the case _ one of the grounds that could have been
the basis for suspending the lower court order.
   U.S. District Judge Franklin Van Antwerpen in Philadelphia issued
a preliminary injunction on March 9 prohibiting the rail unions from
honoring pickets set up by Eastern machinists at SEPTA facilities.
   Van Antwerpen said, ``It takes little imagination to project the
harm and danger which would immediately flow from the cessation of
90,000 passenger rail trips each day.''
   A similar court order in New York City has prevented the Eastern
strike from spreading to commuter railroads in the New York
metropolitan region.
   The Eastern Airlines machinists are said to be trying to use such
sympathy strikes, or secondary boycotts, to prompt President Bush or
Congress to take action in the walk-out against the airline.
   The threatened disruption of the nation's transportation system
could pressure Bush into appointing a special board to mediate the
dispute during a 60-day cooling-off period. Congress also has the
power to impose a settlement recommended by such a board.
   The Machinists union said that sympathy strikes, rarely used in
the transportation industry, are legal under the Railway Labor Act
of 1926.
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that courts may not bar rail
workers from extending a labor dispute to other railroads not
directly involved in the dispute.
   But SEPTA officials said contracts with their workers require
that disputes be ironed out through arbitration.
   The officials said the strike is prohibited by SEPTA's contract
with its workers and because the Railway Labor Act bars strike over
``minor disputes.''
   Judge Van Antwerpen, in issuing the injunction against the
railway workers, ordered the unions and SEPTA to proceed to
arbitration.
   Meanwhile, the Bush administration reiterated its opposition
Tuesday to legislation that would require the president to appoint
an emergency board to recommend a solution to the walkout. The House
is scheduled to consider the bill Wednesday.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner released a letter he
had sent Monday to House members, warning them ``the president
strongly opposes this bill, and his senior advisors would recommend
that he veto this or any similar bill.''
   The administration says it believes there is no emergency that
would justify the appointment of such a board, and that even if one
were named, Eastern's management and workers are so bitter that
little would be accomplished.
   Congressional supporters, mainly Democrats, say the board might
help the two sides reach an agreement. The measure is expected to
pass the House, but it is considered largely symbolic because of its
questionable fate in the Senate and Bush's likely veto.

<HEAD>Singer Charged With Defense Fraud</HEAD>

   The Singer Company and a former subsidiary were
accused by the government Tuesday in a $231 million lawsuit of
fraudulently inflating the price of military aircraft flight
simulators.
   The suit filed by the Justice Department charged that Singer Co.
and Link Flight Simulation Corp., fabricated higher cost estimates
to offset price concessions they might be forced to make during
contract negotiations with the Defense Department.
   The action was taken in a False Claims Act lawsuit originally
filed under seal last fall in U.S. District Court in Baltimore by
Christopher Urda, a former Link Flight price administrator.
   The amended complaint filed by the Justice Department supersedes
the original suit filed by Urda and Taxpayers Against Fraud.
   Under the Civil War-era False Claims Act, private citizens may
sue on behalf of the government if they suspect fraud. The
government is empowered to take over the case if it determines that
the original claims have merit.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said the $231 million
claimed by the government made the case one of the largest suits
brought under the False Claims Act.
   Urda's complaint, which was ordered unsealed by U.S. District
Judge Herbert Murray at the government's request, had accused Singer
of arbitrarily adding a 10 percent labor charge onto original
estimates for the flight simulators over a 15-year period.
   But the government's amended complaint only alleged price fraud
on seven contracts between 1983 and 1986 on flight simulators and
related projects. Link Flight had received a sole-source fixed-price
contract to produce the million-dollar devices for the Pentagon.
   The simulators are used by the military to train pilots to fly
Cobra, Apache, Blackhawk, Chinook helicopters, F-4 and F-16 fighters
and B-52 bombers.
   The government's complaint charged that it added the phony
charges to ``cost estimates which it believed were least likely to
be questioned by the government or which it believed the government
had the least ability to evaluate.''
   The government claimed that it lost $77 million as a result of
the alleged fraud and sought treble damages under the law, plus
civil penalties of $5,000 to $10,000 for each false claim submitted
to the Pentagon.
   The phony bid information was approved by the company's bid
committee, which usually was comprised of the president of Link
Flight and various operating units of the company, the lawsuit said.
   Singer was acquired in 1987 by corporate raider Paul Bilzerian's
Singer Acquisition Co. Last year, Link Flight, based in Binghamton,
N.Y., was sold to CAF Industries, a Canadian company which renamed
it CAE Link Corp.
   Company officials at Singer's corporate headquarters in Stamford,
Conn., said Phil Watson, Singer's general counsel, had left for the
day and was unavailable to make a comment on the lawsuit.
   Bilzerian's secretary in Tampa, Fla., said he was also
unavailable for comment.

   Kurt Vonnegut and other U.S. writers on
Tuesday urged the Security Council to protect Salman Rushdie from a
death sentence issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for alleged
blasphemy in his book, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   But it appeared highly unlikely the council would champion
Rushdie's cause and antagonize Iran, which has agreed to
U.N.-mediated peace talks in its war with Iraq.
   PEN, the association of poets, essayists and novelists; the
National Writers Union, the Authors Guild, the human rights group
ARTICLE 19, and other authors' groups presented petitions to
Britain, Canada and other members of the 15-nation council Tuesday
and asked them to take up the case as an issue of free speech.
   The petition, signed by more than 1,500 writers worldwide,
urgently requests the council to intervene in the Rushdie affair for
humanitarian reasons.
   A delegation of authors met British and Canadian envoys Tuesday
and planned to meet with French, Finnish, Colombian, U.S. and
Yugoslavian representatives. They also sought meetings with all
other members of the most powerful U.N. body.
   So far, only Malaysia, a largely Moslem nation, has declined a
meeting, the authors said. But council members Algeria and Senegal,
also Moslem, were expected to decline.
   British Mission Spokesman J. Stephen Smith told reporters later
that Britain initially had considered taking the matter to the
council but ultimately concluded it was preferable to take action
through diplomatic channels.
   Western diplomats added that with three Moslem members, the
council could not possibly agree on a statement or action strong
enough to satisfy many Western nations.
   Council members also think the Rushdie issue is primarily a
religious, not a political case, and is not the appropriate topic
for council consideration, Western diplomats said.
   The council already has declined to take up the Rushdie case
because the body does not want to offend Iran and jeopardize the
delicate U.N.-mediated Iran-Iraq peace talks.
   But the authors and human rights activists, who began a 36-hour
vigil across the street from here, said their intention was to
publicize the issue.
   The council includes five permanent members with veto power: The
United States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union, and 10
other members: Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Ethiopia,
Malaysia, Nepal, Senegal, Yugoslavia.
   Last month Khomeini ordered Moslems to murder Rushdie on grounds
his book insulted Islam. Rushdie, an Indian-born British citizen, is
in hiding.
   The British government defended Rushdie and the Tehran government
broke its recently restored diplomatic relations with London.
   The delegation and demonstrators included Vonnegut, Philip
Caputo, William Styron, Alix Kates Shulman, Nat Hentoff, Victor
Navasky, National Writers Union President Alec Dubro, publisher Rick
MacArthur of ARTICLE 19, exiled South African poet Dennis Brutus,
and Chilean author Ariel Dorfman.
   In Stirling, Scotland, British Commonwealth Secretary-General Sir
Shridath Ramphal said writers condemning the death threat against
Rushdie had spoken for the rest of the world.
   He said the call for Rushdie's murder had ``understandably and
rightly'' produced a wave of adverse reaction throughout the
Commonwealth, the 48-member organization of Britain and its former
colonies.
   ``The world's writers have more than given a lead in this matter:
I believe they have spoken for the world community in its
collectivity,'' Ramphal told an audience at Stirling University.

   Defense Secretary-designate Dick Cheney
cautioned Tuesday against any U.S. reductions in military strength
in response to changes in the Soviet Union as the Senate Armed
Services Committee opened hearings on President Bush's replacement
for John Tower.
   ``It would be a great mistake to reduce our own military
capabilities and lessen our defense posture,'' the six-term Wyoming
congressman told the committee.
   Cheney used his first day before the panel to expound on his
views of defense policy, including his stand on Star Wars and
burden-sharing, as committee members indicated they will move
quickly on confirmation.
   ``I'm delighted with this nomination,'' said Sen. James Exon of
Nebraska, second ranking Democrat on the panel. ``I hope this
confirmation goes quickly and I believe it will.''
   Added Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.: ``I look forward to working with
him, and I expect his rapid and overwhelming confirmation. America's
defense policy is back on track.''
   Coming after a bitter Senate debate over the Tower nomination,
the first day of consideration of Cheney's nomination was marked by
strong words of praise, sentimentality and indications of support
from both parties.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., a member of the Armed Services
panel, said Cheney's ``sense of humility and a sense of presence
served him well and will serve America well.''
   Senate Republican Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming called the
congressman ``the most steady and unflappable man I have ever known
and he will need it all.''
   The Republican senator also took a swipe at the rancorous Senate
battle that claimed Tower as a victim, saying the process can be
``quite demeaning and quite dehumanizing.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, said the panel
``agreed with the White House to do what we could this week'' on the
nomination, but added that they would ``not be taking any
shortcuts.''
   The Georgia Democrat said quick action on the nomination would be
determined by the speed with which the committee receives the
necessary information on Cheney. The panel is still awaiting letters
from the White House and Pentagon counsels on Cheney's financial
record and the FBI background check.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater was asked
when the FBI checks would be finished.
   ``They're trying to move those as rapidly as possible. ... I
don't have a specific date,'' he said.
   The committee has received the requested tax returns, a statement
from Cheney's doctors and a completed committee questionnaire.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel, one of those introducing
Cheney to the committee, saying he recommended the nomination with a
``combination of pride and regret.''
   And Cheney himself conceded the decision to leave the House was
``wrenching.''
   ``I'm here not because I sought the job but because the president
asked me to take on a difficult assignment,'' the nominee told the
committee.
   Cheney said the top priorities for the Defense Department will be
personnel changes, a general review of strategy and the budget.
   He said he supports a defense budget that would be approved for a
two-year period instead of one year as is customary, an argument
Pentagon officials say will build stability into the weapons-buying
process.
   Questioned by Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on
the committee, Cheney said he was once skeptical of the changes in
the Soviet Union by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has shown a
willingness to negotiate on arms cuts and promoted his policy of
openness called ``glasnost'' and reforms known as ``perestroika.''
Cheney said he believes that the Kremlin leader thinks the ``status
quo is unacceptable.''
   However, the United States should continue to pursue an
aggressive agenda on arms control and not reduce its military
commitments, he said. The Soviets, according to Cheney, are sincere
in seeking arms controls.
   But he noted that ``in the West, the perception of change will
exceed the reality.''
   On other defense issues:
   _ The Wyoming congressman said that in the past he has been a
strong supporter of the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known
as Star Wars. The Pentagon is currently conducting a strategic and
budget review that will have a major impact on Star Wars spending.
Asked about the spending level, Cheney said, ``That's an open
question.''
   _ On the question of burden-sharing by U.S. allies, Cheney said
the United States should encourage Japan and Western Europe to spend
more on defense, but the U.S. argument should be that the additional
money ``is required for our common defense.''
   _ Cheney said Donald Atwood has agreed to accept his nomination
as deputy secretary of defense. Atwood had been chosen by Bush when
Tower was nominated.
   In response to concerns about his health, Cheney submitted a
letter from his cardiologist, Dr. Allan M. Ross of The George
Washington University Medical Center, describing the congressman's
medical history and treatment.
   The 48-year-old Cheney underwent coronary bypass surgery last
summer and has had three heart attacks.
   ``The congressman is presently fit to accept any position
requiring the highest intellectual behavior and physical
performance,'' said Ross, who has treated Cheney since September
1985.
   Questioned by Warner about his two draft deferments during the
early stage of the Vietnam War, Cheney said he requested and
obtained the first deferment because of his academic work and sought
the second because he was married with a small child.
   ``I would have been happy to serve if I had been called,'' Cheney
said.
   The answers the congressman provided to the committee met with
praise, and even Nunn left little doubt as to the final outcome of
the confirmation process, telling Cheney that reports on strategy
and weapons the committee had sought from the Pentagon could be
pushed back ``if you need more time.''
   As Wallop left the hearing, he told Cheney's wife, Lynne, and
their two teen-age daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, ``pretty smooth.''
   The selection last week of Cheney, a former White House chief of
staff in the Ford administration who moved up in the House to the
No. 2 GOP spot, was met with praise.
   Swift action has been promised by the committee and Senate
leadership, in marked contrast to the lengthy debate and bitter
partisan dispute over Tower's alleged excessive drinking and
womanizing and his work as a paid defense consultant after he left
the Senate.
   Bush named Cheney to the Pentagon post last Friday, one day after
the Senate rejected Tower by a 53-47 vote.
   As the stage shifts to Cheney, the administration and Congress
are already working on what will be the next defense secretary's top
priority: Bush's proposed defense budget for fiscal 1990, which cuts
$6.4 billion from former President Reagan's plan of $305.6 billion.
   William H. Taft IV, the deputy defense secretary who has been
running the Pentagon, and Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, urged the Senate Budget Committee on Tuesday
to seek a consensus with the administration on spending.
   ``We have been on a roller-coaster month-to-month as Congress is
reviewing programs and changing them,'' said Taft, who bemoaned the
fact that the nation's security is being guided by mathematics.

   Cambodia's three resistance movements moved toward
a unified fighting force Tuesday by forming a defense council led by
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former ruler turned rebel leader.
   A joint statement from him and the other leaders, who often have
been at odds, also announced a ``common political program''
envisioning ``Western democracy'' and free enterprise after a
Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia. Vietnam invaded in December
1978.
   Amnesty International urged Cambodia's Vietnam-backed government
to furnish information about hundreds of political prisoners it says
were not freed under an amnesty proclaimed last May. A statement
issued in Paris said Amnesty has names of more than 400, including
some arrested 10 years ago, who have not been charged or tried.
   Sihanouk said all rebel forces ``now are practically under my
command.'' The prince, who lives in Beijing part of the year, serves
as president of the Cambodian government-in-exile formed by the
three movements.
   He announced plans for the High Council for National Defense
together with his partners in the resistance government, communist
Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan and Son Sann, who heads a smaller,
non-communist party.
   They have met privately in the Chinese capital since Sunday to
discuss Cambodia's future in light of a Chinese-Soviet summit
planned for May and the Vietnamese rejection of Sihanouk's peace
proposals.
   The prince said he was confident China will not drop its support
of the Cambodian resistance to reach agreement with the Soviets on a
speedy Vietnamese withdrawal. Moscow is Vietnam's main ally.
   ``I am 100 percent sure (China) will continue to support my plan
and support us,'' Sihanouk said. A Vietnamese withdrawal that leaves
the Hanoi-sponsored government of Hun Sen to confront the resistance
``a la Afghanistan'' is not acceptable, he declared.
   Soviet troops finished withdrawing from Afghanistan on Feb. 15,
after nine years of involvement in the communist government's war
with Moslem guerrillas.
   Sihanouk predicted President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet
Union and Deng Xiaoping, the senior Chinese leader, will agree at
the summit to exert pressure on behalf of the prince's plan.
   It calls for U.N. supervision of a Vietnamese withdrawal and free
elections under a provisional government of all parties.
   Vietnam has said it will withdraw by September if a political
agreement is reached, but promised to leave in 1990 in any case.
   A major obstacle to Sihanouk's plan is the refusal of Vietnam and
Hun Sen to accept U.N. supervision and Khmer Rouge participation in
a future government.
   The United States, which helps the resistance, also has been wary
of a return to power by the Khmer Rouge, which gained control in
1975 under the leadership of Pol Pot. At least 1 million people had
died in a reign of terror by the time Vietnam invaded.
   Pol Pot is said to have retired, and Sihanouk said Khieu Samphan
had agreed the former leader would remain out of the picture.
   ``If they break their promise, my army will fight them
indefinitely,'' the prince said, turning to Khieu Samphan. The Khmer
Rouge leader, smiling broadly, said his party would ``accept
realities'' in order to end the occupation.
   Much of the conflict within the alliance has arisen because of
the Khmer Rouge. Sihanouk has accused its forces of repeated attacks
on his army, but told the news conference Tuesday no attacks had
occurred in several months.
   He said one of the defense council's duties would be to resolve
such conflicts. The joint statement said the council would ensure
``solidarity, cooperation and mutual respect and assistance'' among
the three armies.

   Irish Republican Army gunmen
killed a part-time member of the security forces Tuesday at the
meat-packing plant where he worked.
   Police said they arrested six men immediately after the murder
and were questioning them.
   Thomas Hardy, 48, who had a wife and two sons, was shot at
Granville Meat in Dungannon, County Tyrone, a police spokesman said
on condition of anonymity. Hardy was a part-time member of the
Ulster Defense Regiment, the locally recruited wing of the army.
   The outlawed IRA claimed responsibility in a statement to the
British Broadcasting Corp. in Belfast. It has made security forces a
target in its 20-year-old campaign to drive Britain from
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it with the Irish
Republic, which is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.
   Police said they found a car abandoned about 500 yards from the
plant and there was a two-car accident 1{ miles farther on. Three
people were arrested at the accident scene and three others near the
shooting scene, police said.
   On Tuesday night, police reported two more violent incidents:
   _A bomb exploded and shots were fired as a police vehicle passed
Andersonstown Road in mainly Catholic west Belfast. The car was not
damaged but two girls who were passing suffered from shock and were
taken to a hospital.
   _In Cookstown, County Tyrone, a bomb exploded in a hedge about 50
yards from a car police were told had a supicious device inside.
Officers were evacuating the area when the bomb went off and no one
was injured.
   In another development, authorities said 18 policemen were
reprimanded over allegations that the Northern Ireland force
illegally shot six unarmed Catholics to death in 1982.
   Another was cautioned, and charges were dismissed against a 20th
man, said a statement from the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the
provincial police force.
   Five of the dead were acknowledged IRA guerrillas but the sixth
was a teen-ager not involved in the sectarian conflict.
   The affair has been a sore point with Catholics, and Britain's
decision to hold a disciplinary inquiry and not prosecute angered
the Irish government in Dublin.
   All six victims were Catholics, killed in three incidents over a
three-week period. Allegations arose that a shoot-to-kill policy was
in effect, but the police denied it.
   Allegations of a coverup were revived in 1986 when John Stalker,
a police officer from England sent over to investigate the killings,
was forced off the case. He claimed that happened because he was
close to proving a murder conspiracy.
   Two senior officers were suspended and have since resigned on
health grounds.
   The 20 officers were not identified, but nearly all were
sergeants or constables, the British domestic news agency Press
Association reported. It said they were accused of breaches of
discipline ``of a relatively minor nature.''

<TEXT>
   Former Justice Minister Jose Eugenio
Jacquet, an aide to ousted president Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, was
brought to court Tuesday on corruption charges.
   In another development, opposition leader Domingo Laino said the
Electoral Board was hindering efforts to register voters, and he
questioned the integrity of national elections set for May 1 to
replace Stroessner.
   A criminal lawsuit charges five Stroessner Cabinet members and
seven members of his government or the ruling Colorado Party with
``crimes against public administration'' including embezzlement,
bribery and fraud.
   Stroessner flew to exile in neighboring Brazil following the Feb.
3 coup led by Gen. Andres Rodriguez. Former Interior Minister Sabino
Montanaro was given conditional asylum in Honduras, but he may be
called back to face charges.
   A police report accused Jacquet of selling licenses to notaries
and court clerks for $4,000 each, and an audit of the Labor and
Justice Ministry turned up 157 ``planilleros,'' or ``payrollers'' _
people who showed up only to cash their checks each month.
   Jacquet also pressured judges to rule on cases according to his
instructions, ``which resulted in important economic gains,'' the
police report, conducted after the coup, alleged.
   Jacquet's attorney Ramon Alberto Aquino said the charges were
vague. He did not say how his client pleaded, if at all. The
defendants were called to court for formal notification of the
charges against them, and to answer questions from the judge. They
were not obliged to respond to the charges.
   Among the Cabinet members, former Education Minister Carlos Ortiz
Ramirez was accused of creating ``ghost'' employees on his agency's
payrolls and pocketing their salaries when their checks went
uncollected.
   Laino, meanwhie, said the 9-member Electoral Board had provided
only about five voter registration books for every 100 he requested.
His Authentic Radical Liberal Party, the largest opposition group,
has not yet decided whether to contest or boycott the elections.
   ``The facts we have now give us the right to doubt just how clean
and transparent the elections they want us to participate in will
be,'' Laino told a news conference.
   The government reopened registration lists for an additional
month on March 1. The Electoral Board, dominated by members of the
ruling Colorado Party, argues that some 80 percent of all eligible
voters are already registered.
   Laino said the figures used by the board are bloated from
electoral fraud on the part of the Stroessner government. He added
that independent analysts place the number of unregistered, eligible
voters in Paraguay at 35 percent.
   ``In elections last year, according to official figures by the
Electoral Board, the number of votes surpassed the number of
registered voters in 39 districts,'' Laino said. ``Even the dead and
ghosts voted.''
   Gen. Rodriguez is the presidential candidate of the Colorado
Party, which has been in power since 1947 and is widely expected to
retain control of the presidency and congress.

   President Bush on Tuesday endorsed a Treasury
Department plan urging partial forgiveness by commercial banks of
outstanding Third World debt.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush decided
to back the plan, advanced on Friday by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, after an evening meeting of the National Security Council.
   ``The president fully supports the concepts and processes for
debt reduction and economic growth outlined by Secretary Brady,''
Fitzwater said.
   Brady's plan has as its central element the partial forgiveness
by commercial banks of the $410 billion in debt run up by developing
nations, most of them in Latin America.
   It represents a major shift in administration thinking.
   The Reagan administration had argued against any writing off by
banks of outstanding Third World debt and adhered to a plan crafted
by then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III calling for new bank
loans to countries enacting economic reforms.
   Fitzwater said that Baker, now the secretary of state, was in
full accord with the new so-called ``Brady plan,'' as was the
Federal Reserve, which reportedly had voiced earlier reservations.
   Bush until now had reserved judgment on the plan, even though it
had won wide international praise.
   Fitzwater cautioned that nothing should be read into the delay,
saying, ``it's just the way the process developed.''
   Brady's plan calls for banks to forgive part of the outstanding
debt by using money from the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund as collateral.
   The plan also envisions some of the debt being swapped by banks
for bonds of lower face value.
   Brady had revealed the proposal in a speech to a conference
sponsored by the Bretton Woods Committee, a group which deals with
international economic issues.
   Fitzwater said the president had not wanted to commit himself to
the plan until the National Security Council had had a chance to
meet on the proposal, but told Brady to make the speech anyway.

<HEAD>Royal Family Gets Pay Increase of 4.6 Percent, Below Inflation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II and her family got a pay
increase in Tuesday's annual budget of 4.6 percent, which was lower
than inflation but still means they will cost the taxpayers $10.6
million.
   The increase of 273,000 pounds ($466,800) brought the total to
6,195,300 pounds ($10,594,000), and was too much for some Labor
Party legislators whatever its relation to the cost of living.
   ``For the royal family, it looks as though Christmas has come
early,'' Labor member Max Madden said in the House of Commons.
   An increase of 4.6 percent for the Civil List, as the royal
allowances are known, compares with annual inflation of 7.5 percent,
up from 3.3 percent a year ago.
   Members of the royal family are paid for carrying out such
official duties as receiving ambassadors, presenting awards, opening
hospitals, visiting the armed forces and making foreign tours.
   Most of the money goes to salaries for the 350 royal household
staff, from private secretaries to coachmen, gardeners and window
cleaners at Buckingham Palace and the other royal residences.
   Queen Elizabeth, rich in in her own right, will receive 4.65
million pounds ($7.96 million) in the 1989-90 fiscal year, up from
4.55 million pounds.
   Her 88-year-old mother, Queen Mother Elizabeth, will get 404,000
pounds ($691,000), and Prince Philip, her husband, will be paid
225,300 pounds ($385,000).
   The queen's youngest son Prince Edward, 25, who quit the Royal
Marines and now works as a production assistant for a theater
company run by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, does not get a raise.
He has received 20,000 pounds ($34,200) a year since 1982.
   Prince Charles, heir to the throne, and his wife Diana are not on
the list because he is Prince of Wales and lives on income from the
Duchy of Cornwall estates. That amounted to 1.4 million pounds ($2.4
million) last year.
   The largest percentage raise was for the queen's second son,
Prince Andrew, Duke of York, a naval lieutenant on a destroyer. His
state allowance rises from 86,500 pounds ($148,000) to 155,400
pounds (nearly $266,000), or more than 79 percent. He also will get
21,000 pounds (nearly $36,000) in service pay plus allowances.
   Andrew has been accused of taking too much leave and not handling
enough royal duties to justify his allowance.
   Madden called the raise a ``monster increase'' that would ``amaze
and astonish'' most people, who he said would not find much benefit
for themselves in the budget.
   Andrew's raise will pay for his office at Buckingham Palace,
established in 1986 when he married Sarah Ferguson, now Duchess of
York. Their staff includes a private secretary, a full-time
lady-in-waiting, up to four clerks, a chauffeur and a dresser to
look after the duchess's clothes.
   Labor legislator Chris Mullin said the royal family should pay
tax on their state grants and claimed the queen could afford it
because she is ``one of the richest people in the world.''
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said
she pays the equivalent of 80 percent tax on the income from her
estates and invested wealth, double the top rate of her richest
subjects.
   ``The queen is the most heavily taxed person in Britain,'' he
said, and estimated royal revenues at 50 million pounds ($85.5
million) a year, of which the queen would retain 10 million pounds
($17.1 million).
   ``That is the same as being taxed at 80 percent,'' Brooks-Baker
said.
   In the time of King George III in the 18th century, he said,
monarchs found they could not live on their income and agreed to
surrender all revenues in return for the Civil List, a sum
Parliament deemed sufficient for their needs.
   Each monarch since has opted for the Civil List at the start of a
new reign, but because today's royal revenues are much greater than
before, the queen has been allowed to keep a portion, Brooks-Baker
said.

<HEAD>High Wind Blows Dust Over West Plains, Snow Hits Northern Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wind blowing up to 120 mph blasted the western Plains and stirred
up blinding dust storms Tuesday, while heavy, blowing snow closed
schools and halted travel on the northern Plains.
   Snow fell from Utah, Colorado and Wyoming to northern and central
Nebraska, South Dakota, southeastern North Dakota, central
Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan. Schools were
closed in sections of Wisconsin, Minnesota and South Dakota.
   Wind hammered eastern Colorado early in the day. Gusts up to 120
mph northwest of Loveland knocked down trees and utiltiy poles,
wiped out a section of bleachers at Bandimere Speedway and closed
eastern Plains roads with blowing dirt.
   A dozen ski lifts in Colorado's Summit County were shut down for
a time by the wind. On Monday, 220 skiers had to be evacuated from a
chairlift at Aspen Mountain resort when a gust knocked the lift
cable off its track.
   In Loveland, the wind shoved a truck across U.S. 287 and knocked
it onto its side and toppled utility poles near the Rocky Flats
nuclear weapons plant. Trees were knocked down in western Denver.
   Winds gusted to 53 mph at Pueblo, Colo., 66 mph at Hill City,
Kan., and 86 mph west of Albin, Wyo.
   In western Kansas, visibility was reduced to about one city block
in Garden City and Hill City. State authorities reported numerous
traffic accidents, and many roads, including sections of Interstate
70, were closed.
   ``The whole county is in the air, so to speak,'' said a secretary
at the Thomas County sheriff's office in Colby. She said all roads
in and out of Colby were closed.
   Winter storm warnings for heavy snow and strong wind were posted
for southeastern North Dakota, northeastern and north-central South
Dakota, much of Minnesota, and northern Wisconsin.
   Snowfall since Monday afternoon across Wyoming included 32 inches
at Burgess Junction, 18 inches at Story, 7 inches at Big Horn and 6
inches at Sheridan. Interstate 90 between Sheridan and Buffalo was
closed by snow, the National Weather Service said.
   In South Dakota, there were reports of 8 to 10 inches of new snow
at Deadwood and Galena and a foot at Belle Fourche. North Dakota
snowfall included 9 inches at Wahpeton, 8 inches at Hankinson and 6
at Wisher. Minnesota snowfall included about 10 inches at
Evansville, 6 inches at Fort Ripley and 5 inches at Ortonville.
   Blowing snow cut visibility to zero at times around Aberdeen,
S.D., and snowplows had to be pulled off highways because their
drivers couldn't see.
   The heaviest snow in Wisconsin was in Douglas County in the
state's northwestern corner, where many roads were closed by snow
and drifting snow.
   South of the snow belt, rain fell across northern Iowa, southern
Minnesota, southern and central Wisconsin and into northern Illinois.
   Elsewhere, rain was scattered along the northern Pacific Coast.
   In the South, Midland, Texas, warmed to a record 87 degrees for
the date and Atlanta tied its record of 80.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 14
degrees at Devils Lake, N.D., to 91 at Beeville and McAllen, Texas.
Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 11 degrees above zero at
Great Falls, Mont.
   For Wednesday, rain was forecast from New England and northern
New Jersey to New York, much of Pennsylvania, northern Ohio,
northern Indiana and southern lower Michigan, becoming snow and
reaching across northeastern Illinois, the rest of Michigan,
northern Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota. Snow over Montana was
expected to change to rain, reaching across the northern two thirds
of the Pacific Coast.
   Highs only in the teens were predicted over northeastern Montana;
in the 20s from the remainder of northern Montana across North
Dakota, northeastern South Dakota, the upper Mississippi Valley,
much of Wisconsin, upper Michigan and northern lower Michigan; in
the 30s and 40s in northern New England, the lower Great Lakes, the
lower Ohio Valley, the middle Mississippi Valley, the central
Plains, southwestern South Dakota, the northern Rockies, the Idaho
Panhandle and eastern Washington; in the 50s and 60s from cental and
southern New England to the upper Ohio Valley, the lower half of the
Appalachians, the Tennessee Valley, northern sections of the central
Gulf Coast states, Arkansas and northern Louisiana, Oklahoma,
northern Texas, the lower half of the Rockies, the Great Basin and
the northern three-fourths of the Pacific Coast; and generally in
the 70s and 80s over the remainder of the nation.

<HEAD>General Declares Loyalty to Government After Headgear Rumpus</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turkey's highest-ranking military man
declared the army's loyalty to Turkish democracy on Tuesday after
the opposition expressed fear the military would intervene in a
controversy over Islamic headgear.
   A constitutional court last week declared unconstitutional a
parliamentary ruling that allowed Moslem women to cover their heads
while attending university classes with men.
   Moslem fundamentalists staged protest marches and the government
of Premier Turgut Ozal found itself in an increasingly uncomfortable
situation during campaigning for March 26 local elections.
   Advocates of secularism see the headcover as a political symbol
of those who want Turkey to return to Islamic laws, as Iran has.
   Tolerance for the fundamentalists angered some secular groups,
including Turkey's elite and military leaders.
   On Sunday, Gen. Necip Torumtay,, chief of staff of the armed
forces, paid a surprise visit to President Kenan Evren. Torumtay
later told the Istanbul daily Cumhuriyet, ``We are following the
issue closely.''
   This led Erdal Inonu, leader of the major opposition Social
Democratic Populist Party, to declare: ``We are against a solution
through (military) intervention. We believe we can overcome these
dangers within the democratic system.''
   Turkey's armed forces staged coups in 1960, 1971 and 1980.
   On Tuesday, Torumtay said in a written statement to news media:
   ``The Turkish armed forces ... knows its place and duties within
the constitutional order and is a true believer in and loyal to
parliamentary democracy with all its members.''
   He said he issued the statement because his earlier statements
underwent ``different interpretations in newspapers.''
   Yusuf Ozal, the premier's brother and a Cabinet minister,
criticized the court decision as ``badly timed. ... It was wrong to
take such a decision before elections.''
   Turgut Ozal's governing, conservative Motherland Party is
competing with several center-right parties for the votes of Moslem
fundamentalists, who comprise about 10 percent of the total
electorate of 27 million.
   Ozal's own party is split on the headgear issue, and interference
by Iran complicated matters.
   On Monday, Iranian women students marched through Tehran to
protest the ban on Islamic dress in Turkey's campuses.
   Turkish papers reported that Tehran radio, in Turkish-language
broadcasts beamed to eastern Turkey, urged fundamentalists to rebel
against the secular order.
   Newspaper reports said authorities detained Iranian agents who
were among the protesters in Turkey, but officials did not confirm
these reports.
   Beginning in the 1920s, Turkey adopted Western laws with the
reforms of Kemal Ataturk, founder of the republic.

<TEXT>
   Educators who yank apples from school lunch
rooms for fear of chemical contamination are running from a ``toxic
bogeyman,'' the state health director said Tuesday.
   Biting into a shiny, red apple as he discussed the issue with
reporters, Kenneth Kizer, said fears that children will get cancer
from the farm chemical daminozide, or Alar, are based on a
misinterpretation of a recent study by a private interest group.
   Apples and apple products are being banned from school cafeterias
in cities around the nation because of publicity about the potential
cancer threat from Alar, a chemical used in a minority of orchards.
   School systems in Atlanta, San Francisco, Chicago and dozens of
other cities stopped distributing apples this week, following the
earlier lead of New York City and Los Angeles. Schools in San Diego
and Portland, Ore., decided against such a ban.
   California is conducting its own tests on apples to assess any
risk. The results aren't due for another 10 days, but Kizer said he
believes the school apple bans are ``reactionary and premature, and
indeed our fear is they have really created a toxic bogeyman.''
   Kizer advised consumers to continue eating fruit, saying there
may be worse dangers in sugary alternatives.
   ``When we send a message to our kids that apples aren't safe,
what are they going to eat? They're going to eat Twinkies and
Zingers,'' he said.
   Despite his comments, millions of schoolchildren went without
apples, applesauce and juice Tuesday as more schools quit serving
apple products because the fruit might be tainted with Alar.
   Farm groups maintain there is little threat from the chemical,
and the manufacturer, Uniroyal Chemical Co. of Middlebury, Conn.,
estimates it is used on only 5 percent of America's apple crop.
   ``It's far more dangerous for them (school children) to ride the
school bus or breathe the air ... than eating an apple treated with
Alar,'' said Ron Myers, a Wenatchee, Wash., apple grower who is also
a member of the Washington Apple Commission.
   Daminozide is used most commonly on apples but also on other
fruit and on flowers. It prevents apples from dropping or being
blown from trees before they ripen, brings out color in some
varieties and may help improve texture and shelf life.
   The latest controversy over Alar was prompted by an NRDC report
that said daminozide poses a greater cancer threat to children than
to adults. The public interest group said research shows that is
because children's bodies are smaller and because they tend to eat
more apples and apple products.
   Worries about Alar grew as ``60 Minutes'' broadcast a report on
the subject and actress Meryl Streep spoke out in alarm.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said in February that tests
show a correlation between the chemical and cancer in mice. The
agency is conducting an 18-month review with an eye toward banning
the chemical.
   Atlanta school officials say Monday's decision to scratch apples
from school lunch menus was strictly precautionary, taken in the
absence of any evidence that Alar-treated apples have been served in
the system's 116 schools.
   ``When you're talking about children, we believe it's better to
take precautions,'' said Modenia N. Andrews, director of nutrition
for Atlanta schools. ``There's so much in the media, we felt it
expedient to go ahead and make that decision until more information
is available.''
   ``Because of the public outcry, I feel it's better to be
conservative and eliminate the apples until it's cleared by the
FDA,'' said Richard Farrar, director of food services for the San
Francisco Unified School District.
   A spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation and apple
growers said the San Francisco district's move was unfounded.
   ``They are attacking the whole industry, when it's just a small
group of growers in the Northwest using (Alar),'' said grower John
Bella. ``They are hurting us real bad and it's unfair. They should
get their facts straight.''
   Uniroyal Chemical estimates use has dropped to about 5 percent of
the U.S. apple crop because of health concerns raised in recent
years. That's down from 40 percent of the crop in 1985, when cancer
concerns were last raised.
   Varieties most commonly treated are MacIntosh, red delicious,
golden delicious, and Jonathan. Granny Smith, Pippin and other green
apples generally aren't treated.
   California is the nation's fourth-biggest producer of apples, a
market dominated by Washington state.

<HEAD>Baker: Premature to Talk of a US Withdrawal from Korea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Tuesday that it is premature to talk about withdrawing U.S. troops
from South Korea, but he said the Bush administration is pressing
the Seoul government to increase its share of the common defense
burden.
   ``I do think it's a bit premature to talk about pulling troops
out when you consider the security threat that still exists as far
as the North Koreans are concerned,'' Baker told a House
Appropriations subcommittee.
   ``If we were ever to get to that point, I would think we would
only get there after the South Koreans themselves had significantly
beefed up their own armed forces,'' he added.
   Baker, testifying before the committee about the U.S. foreign aid
program, was asked by Rep. Robert J. Mrazek, D-N.Y., why the U.S.
had no plans to withdraw its 40,000 troops from South Korea, ``a
nation that has the most dynamic economy in the world right now.''
   ``There are over 40 million South Koreans, there are around 20
million North Koreans, and we continue to spend billions of dollars
in supporting our troops in that nation,'' said Mrazek.
   He said the Pentagon has a draft plan for the withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Panama and contingency plans to reduce U.S. bases in the
Philippines, but nothing for Korea.
   ``Overwhelmingly the American people recognize that at this
particular juncture _ considering the investment of almost $100
billion since 1954 _ that the South Koreans can pretty well take
care of themselves,'' Mrazek said.
   ``I don't see any reason why South Korea can't put more people in
uniform in defending its own interests,'' he added.
   Baker answered that ``it's very important to recognize that there
may be more South Koreans than North Koreans, but there are a heck
of a lot more North Koreans in uniform and in the armed forces, and
they are, percentage-wise, I suppose, the most heavily armed nation
_ or one of the most heavily armed nations _ in the world.''
   ``Our commitment to the security of South Korea is what has
enabled it to become the dynamic economic power that it has
become,'' he added. ``It has only recently come out of the shadows
of being a debtor nation.''
   He said that when he and President Bush and he visited South
Korea last month, they impressed on President Roh Tae-woo and other
South Koreans the importance of increasing their share of the
defense burden and ``accepting the role in the world that success
brings.''
   ``They are no longer a developing country,'' Baker said. ``And we
need access to their markets and we need, we need fairness with
respect to exchange rates and things like that.''

<HEAD>Judge Signs Teamsters-Government Settlement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge approved the settlement of the
government's civil racketeering case against the Teamsters on
Tuesday, saying it meant the union's leadership is pledged to keep
it free from the influence of organized crime.
   U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein signed the agreement,
reached just before a trial of the government's lawsuit was to begin
Monday, noting that the Teamsters union ``has had a long and sordid
career of corruption and involvement with criminal elements.''
   But in agreeing to the settlement, which will implement sweeping
reforms including the direct election of the union's top leadership,
Teamster officials ``have today done their members a great
service,'' Edelstein said.
   However, Teamsters President William J. McCarthy, one of the
individual defendants in the case, was less enthusiastic in his
comments.
   ``While I reluctantly accept the terms of the consent order, I
believe it is not the vindication and exoneration Teamsters
deserve,'' McCarthy said in a statement issued by the union. ``The
fact is this suit should never have been filed in the first place.''
   Under the tentative agreement, which the government says will
wrest the nation's largest trade union from Mafia domination, three
court-appointed watchdogs will oversee the Teamsters union for three
years.
   Edelstein received the settlement Monday afternoon, but delayed
approving it to clarify ``apparent ambiguities on matters of serious
importance.''
   The main change, made at Edlestein's request, was that the
government and the Teamsters agree on two names to submit to the
judge for each of the watchdog positions, so that six names instead
of three will be offered for the three posts.
   The settlement, announced just hours before the start of the
trial on a federal civil racketeering lawsuit to oust the union's
allegedly mob-influenced executive board, was reached early Monday
after round-the-clock weekend negotiations.
   The lawsuit, filed last June, claimed the Teamsters' leadership
had been dominated by organized crime, which deprived union members
of their rights through racketeering and a ``campaign of fear'' that
included 20 murders, dozens of bombings and other violence.
   Most of the 26 reputed mobsters originally named as defendants in
the case were dismissed when they either agreed or were ordered to
drop any involvement with the Teamsters. Five, including convicted
Colombo crime family boss Carmine ``Junior'' Persico, have been
severed from the case and are to be tried later.
   For the first time in Teamsters history, the union's top leaders
will be elected directly by the membership in secret ballot votes
beginning in 1991.
   Currently, delegates to the national convention pick the
executive board members by roll-call vote.
   Under the settelement, the three overseers will be appointed for
three years by the judge with the joint approval of both sides. One
would investigate and prosecute alleged union corruption, another
would administer disciplinary action and the third would oversee
elections.
   After the 1991 union elections are certified, the three overseers
will be replaced by an independent review board empowered to
investigate and remedy allegations of corruption.

   Rescue teacms succeeded in helping 30
grounded whales back into the open waters of the Strait of Magellan,
but eight others died on the beach, authorities reported Tuesday.
   Alejandro Roman, regional director of the National Fishing
Agency, said the whales had been stranded for more than 24 hours at
Playa Pescado, 18 miles north of the town of Punta Arenas. The
whales ranged in length from nine to 15 feet.
   Reporters for state television covered the rescue operation and
said most of the whales that died resisted efforts to move them into
the water.
   It was the third mass grounding of whales on beaches along the
Strait of Magellan in two weeks. Navy officials said dozens of the
mammals were saved by navy personnel and fishermen who managed to
get them back into deeper waters but at least 90 perished.
   Marine specialists said they had no explanation for the
groundings actions but speculated that the normally frigid waters at
the tip of South America were unusually warm and that affected the
whales' sonar system of determining directions.

<HEAD>FBI: Too Early To Rule Out Any Possible Motive In Bombing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The skipper of the USS Vincennes, whose wife was
the apparent target of a pipe bomb attack, emerged from protected
seclusion Tuesday to take the ship's helm.
   Navy Capt. Will C. Rogers, who was commanding the Vincennes last
year when its crew mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner, guided
the ship out of the San Diego Naval Station for routine, daylong
exercises off the California coast, a Navy spokesman said.
   The FBI continued its investigation into the bombing of a van
driven by his wife, Sharon Rogers, and said it had not dismissed the
possibility that the bomb was planted by international terrorists.
   Agency spokesman Ron Orrantia said it would be premature to rule
out any potential motive in Friday's bombing, including retribution
for the airliner downing.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said Monday that the FBI appeared to
be backing off the theory that the bombing was internationally
directed terrorism because the device was a crude pipe bomb.
   ``It is their belief a sophisticated terrorist, one who is
trained in the use of explosives for car bombings, would have done a
better job and that (Mrs. Rogers) would not have escaped,'' Wilson
said.
   Bu Orrantia said Tuesday, ``The FBI is not eliminating anything
at this point. We are leaving all avenues open right now. We are not
trying to limit our scope right now.''
   Mrs. Rogers escaped the blast unhurt, getting out of the van
moments before it caught fire and burned at a busy San Diego
intersection.
   The city Fire Department described the device as a pipe bomb. FBI
officials have said only that the explosive device was non-military
in origin, possibly homemade, and that a pipe bomb would fall into
that generic category.
   Fragments recovered from the blast scene have been sent to the
FBI laboratory in Washington for analysis, and officials were
awaiting a final determination about the device's characteristics,
Orrantia said.
   He declined to discuss other aspects of the investigation, but
said the FBI's report on the bomb would be publicly released when it
is completed.
   Law enforcement officials are looking into the possibility that
someone acted on a grudge against the Rogers family or that one or
more rogue Iranian supporters acted on their own, an FBI official
told the Los Angeles Times.
   Naval Investigative Service agents continue to protect Rogers and
his wife, who have been staying at an undisclosed location since

   The Vincennes returned to San Diego last October, ending a
six-month Persian Gulf deployment. It was during that deployment in
July that the cruiser mistook a civilian airliner for a hostile
aircraft during a firefight with Iranian surface ships and brought
it down with a missile. All 290 people aboard the plane were killed.

<HEAD>Judge Says Tuscarora Activist Should Go Back to North Carolina</HEAD>

   Fugitive Indian activist Timothy Jacobs
cannot stay in New York state to avoid prosecution for the armed
takeover of a North Carolina newspaper office in 1988, a judge ruled
Tuesday.
   Lawyers for Timothy Jacobs filed an appeal even before the ruling
was issued, meaning he will remain in New York while the legal
battle continues.
   Jacobs and fellow Tuscarora Indian Eddie Hatcher, 31, both of
Pembroke, N.C., used shotguns to hold 20 people hostage at The
Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton, N.C., for 10 hours before
surrendering in February 1988. Hatcher and Jacobs said they were
trying to publicize allegations of corruption.
   A task force formed by North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin later
concluded that the corruption claims were unfounded.
   Hatcher, who made an unsuccessful bid for political asylum last
week at the Soviet consulate in San Francisco, appeared before a
federal magistrate Monday and was ordered held there on federal
flight charges until next week. The charge may expedite his return
to North Carolina by avoiding state extradition proceedings.
   The two men were first tried and acquitted in federal court on
hostage-taking and firearms charges, but then were indicted by a
Robeson County grand jury last December on state kidnapping charges.
   Jacobs fled North Carolina before he could be arrested and tried
to take refuge at the Onondaga Indian Reservation near Syracuse. New
York police arrested him for speeding in December.
   Hatcher fled to Idaho, but was arrested Friday by the FBI in San
Francisco.
   In Wampsville, Madison County Judge William O'Brien III rejected
claims that Jacobs' life would be in danger if returned to North
Carolina because of his knowledge of corruption.
   ``You've spent the entire time here with the same information
about drug trafficking and there has been no evidence of any harm to
you or any threats to you,'' O'Brien told Jacobs, 20.
   The judge revoked Jacobs' $25,000 bail. A hearing was scheduled
Monday to see if Hatcher, 31, should be allowed to post bond.

   Television preacher and self-styled faith healer
Pierre Lacroix was convicted on Tuesday on a charge of gross
indecency involving a male teen-ager. Lacroix said he would appeal
and vowed to clear his name.
   The bearded, 40-year-old evangelist, a married Roman Catholic lay
preacher and the father of four, was acquitted of two other charges
of gross indecency.
   Lacroix became a household name across Quebec through a 15-minute
daily TV broadcast that was taken off the air after he was charged.
His ``Marathon of Love'' rallies packed big sports arenas like the
Montreal Forum.
   Police arrested Lacroix after a young man alleged that the
preacher engaged in sexual acts with him after he went to Lacroix
for counseling, and that this practice continued from 1983 to 1987.
   Lacroix, freed on bail after his arrest last September, faces a
maximum sentence of five years.
   ``It's going to be a long road,'' said a smiling Lacroix as he
announced he would ask his lawyer to appeal the guilty verdict
reached by a jury after 2{ days' deliberation.
   Justice Jean Bienvenue of Quebec Superior Court set sentencing
for Wednesday.
   ``Only time will tell,'' replied Lacroix when asked by reporters
whether he still has a future as a television evangelist. ``It
really doesn't depend on me.''

<HEAD>Baker: Manley More Moderate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Tuesday that Michael Manley, the new Jamaican prime minister, has
moderated his political views and would prove an ally in the battle
against drug trafficking.
   Baker's assessment came in answer to a question from Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House Appropriations foreign
subcommittee, during a hearing on the Bush administration's foreign
aid package.
   Manley is here to meet with a variety of U.S. officials,
including Baker.
   Baker told the panel that ``it's the view of many people in our
government that he has moderated his views and policies and that he
will be a reliable partner in terms of the drug problem.''
   Manley was re-elected last month, nine years after his leftist
government was voted out of office. During his first tenure, he had
alarmed the United States with some of his policies.
   Manley has been stressing his desire for the ``widest and most
constructive'' relationship possible with the Bush administration
and has said he will try to cooperate with U.S. officials to combat
drug trafficking through Jamaica.
   Manley told reporters he plans to raise the issues of drugs,
tourism and development when he meets with U.S. legislators.
   He is also supposed to Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and
William Bennett, the drug czar.
   Jamaica wants help from the United States because it needs to
``greatly improve interdiction and intelligence capabilities,''
particularly against cocaine smugglers, Manley said. Additionally,
the country has no drug rehabilitation facilities, a lack that needs
to be addressed.
   Manley said the country wants to increase the number of hotel
rooms and work to end the harassment of tourists. Tourism is a major
part of the Jamaican economy.
   As for relations with Cuba, Manley said his country intends to
re-establish diplomatic ties that were broken in the early 1980s.
The Cubans would be permitted to establish an embassy in Kingston.
   Though Manley said he doesn't agree with Cuban leader Fidel
Castro's political philosophy, he believes in having normal contact
with all nations, just at the United States has diplomatic links
with the Soviet Union.
   ``We don't intend to allow those relations to be provocative,''
he said.
   Manley said he told former Secretary of State George Shultz about
the plan to re-open a Cuban Embassy.

   State legislators Tuesday condemned a student
artwork that features a U.S. flag spread on the floor as novelist
Larry Heinemann joined a statewide arts organization in support of
the embattled exhibit.
   After more than an hour of impassioned debate in Springfield, the
Illinois House approved a non-binding resolution 99-5 urging that
the exhibit at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago be closed.
   ``It's not a veterans issue, it's an American issue,'' said state
Rep. Linda Williamson, who had joined in protests in Chicago against
the exhibit. Most of the demonstrators were veterans and their
families.
   The Finance Committee of the Chicago Park District, owner of the
land on which the Art Institute is located, also on Tuesday reversed
itself and recommended that the Art Institute and seven other
Chicago museums get $28.4 million in funding. The full board later
approved the appropriation.
   Last week, the committee, citing the flag exhibit, voted to cut
off the money. The Art Institute's share is $6.5 million.
   Republican state Sen. Walter Dudycz, a leader in protests against
the flag exhibit, held a noon rally at the Capitol in Springfield to
draw attention to his resolution condemning the artwork.
   Heinemann, a Chicagoan who won the 1987 National Book Award for
his novel ``Paco's Story,'' said the enormous public response to the
exhibit at the School of the Art Institute indicated the school was
doing its job.
   Although the display has ``deeply and greatly shocked many
people,'' Heinemann said, ``any arts institute ... fails if students
are not given the freedom to explore subject matter and content.''
   Both Dudycz and Heinemann are Vietnam veterans.
   The Illinois Arts Alliance said the Art Institute had a
constitutional right to display the work by student Scott Tyler.
   ``And when we trample on the U.S. Constitution, we trample on
everything the American flag symbolizes,'' said Henry Fogel,
president of the multidisciplinary, statewide advocacy organization
for the arts. Fogel appeared at a news conference with Heinemann.
   The work, ``What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag,''
consists of a 32-by-59-inch flag spread on a floor next to a wall.
On the wall are mounted a photograph of several flag-draped coffins
and a small shelf. On the shelf, which is located directly above the
flag, are a bound collection of other photographs _ including one of
a U.S. flag being burned _ and a ledger in which visitors are
invited to write comments.
   The display is part of a 66-student show that opened on Feb. 17
and is scheduled to close Thursday.
   The exhibit has enraged veterans groups, who contend it
encourages people to walk on the U.S. flag, and has prompted daily
demonstrations outside the Art Institute, including one on Sunday
that drew more than 2,000 people.
   In Midland, Mich., the City Council on Monday night unanimously
approved a resolution condemning the Chicago exhibit. Midland is
near Saginaw, about 250 miles northeast of Chicago.
   ``My whole being just rebels at the thought of any dishonor to
the flag,'' said Councilman Harry McCaffrey, who introduced the
resolution.
   On Tuesday a tavern in Beach Park, a town north of Chicago, said
it would cover its floor with pictures of artist Tyler on Wednesday
and invite patrons to walk on them.

   The entire 23-man crew missing from a
chemical tanker that burst into flames Tuesday probably were trapped
inside the ship and did not survive, Japanese coast guard officials
said.
   The search resumed Wednesday for the Irish captain, three Britons
and 19 Filipinos who were aboard. Yukio Yoshino earlier told a news
conference the men's chances for survival now were ``very slim.''
   Yoshino, head of the Yokohama branch of the Maritime Safety
Agency, Japan's coast guard, said, ``Since there was no time for
crew members to send an emergency signal, it is unlikely that they
had time to prepare lifeboats for escape.''
   ``The tanker is still burning and the explosions are
continuing,'' Yoshio Nakamura, spokesman for the agency's Yokohama
branch, reported on Wednesday.
   The skipper was James Rickard, 50, of Ireland. Earlier, erroneous
accounts had Rickard as coming from Britain.
   The Liberia-registered 23,038-ton Maasgusar, containing 25,700
tons of flammable toxic liquids, was found engulfed in flames about
66 miles southwest of Nojimazaki, south of Tokyo, early Tuesday
morning by a patrol plane.
   Powerful explosions apparently blew a huge hole in a chemical
tank on the ship's port side. Television reports showed chemicals
leaking out of the hole and burning on the surface of the water, he
said.
   The Maritime Safety Agency and the Maritime Self-Defense Force
sent 14 ships and 11 aircraft to rescue crew members and help douse
the fire, but no vessels were able to approach the tanker by Tuesday
evening because of the strong flames, the thick toxic fumes rising
more than 330 feet and the occasional explosions.
   Patrol planes searching the area found four plastic lifeboats,
some of them half-burned, from the tanker, but no trace of its
crewmen, Yoshino said.
   The agency decided not to take any measures to extinguish the
fire at least until Wednesday morning because of the intense flames
and smoke, he said.
   Agency officials expressed concern about possible pollution that
the leak of the poisonous fumes and chemicals might cause. The
chemicals that have leaked out can injure the skin and cause toxic
reactions, said Hiroshi Watanabe of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry's Chemical Product Division.
   ``Whether or not the chemicals are acute toxins, it's definitely
not good if such chemicals stay in the ocean for a long period of
time,'' he said.
   Maritime Safety Agency officials said the tanker's 25,000 tons of
chemicals, including ethylene chloride, isopropyl benzene and
paraxylene, had begun to leak into the ocean and poisonous gas was
released as the cargo burned. The amount of contamination due to the
discharge could not be immediately determined, they said.
   The cause of the fire was unknown, but the 5-year-old tanker,
designed to carry special petroleum chemicals, had recently
developed engine problems and underwent provisional repairs during a
trip off the coast of Hawaii, said an official of Nedlloyd, Japan, a
branch of the Netherlands-based operator of the ship.
   The turbo charger of the ship's engine was found to have defects
and some parts inside the turbo cylinders were replaced, said
Katsumi Sato, Nedlloyd's director of operations.
   Agency officials said an explosion may have caused the fire,
preventing the crew from sending distress signals.
   The tanker was on its way from Houston to South Korea via Panama
and Yokohama. It had been expected to dock at Yokohama port around
noon Tuesday, Sato said.

   The bodies of two U.S. airmen were recovered
Wednesday after their helicopter crashed into the ocean during a
routine practice mission. Air Force officials said a third man was
killed but his body had not been recovered.
   Paul Berger, chief of community relations at Kadena Air Base in
Okinawa, said the two bodies were found early Wednesday by rescuers.
   The names of the victims were not released pending notification
of the next of kin, he said.
   The HH-3 helicopter with five crew members aboard crashed at 8:35
p.m. Tuesday during a routine practice mission near Ieshima island,
north of Okinawa.
   Two of the five were picked up by an Air Force rescue aircraft
and were reported in good condition at Kadena, Berger said. The
cause of the accident was under investigation, he added.
   The helicopter belonged to the 33rd Aerospace Rescue Recovery
Squadron at the air base 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo.

   Two U.S. Air Force F-16 jet fighters
collided Tuesday during a training mission over central Spain's
Cuenca province, and one pilot was missing and feared dead, military
officials said.
   A second pilot parachuted to safety and was released after being
examined at a hospital.
   Air Force Capt. Willette Parker said the jets had left Madrid's
Torrejon Air Base when they collided.
   She identified the pilot who parachuted to safety as Capt. Steven
Kempf, 27, of Glendale, Ariz., who was examined and released from
Torrejon base hospital.
   She said the identity of the other pilot was not available and
that the cause of the accident had not been determined yet.
   A statement released by the Spanish Ministry of Defense said the
missing pilot had died.
   Both aircraft belonged to a squadron of the 401st Tactical
Fighter Wing, part of the 16th Air Force headquartered at Torrejon.
   On Dec. 5, the commander of the 16th Air Force, Gen. Winfield S.
Harpe, was killed during a similar accident in the same general area.
   Jane's Defense Weekly reported in December that the U.S. Air
Force lost 20 F-16s in service in countries of the 16-member North
Atlantic Treaty Organization last year.
   The 72 F-16s in the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing are to be
transferred to a base in Italy within three years under terms of a
new agreement signed in December by Spain and the United States.

   The Bush administration suspended imports of
AK-47s and most other semiautomatic weapons Tuesday but denied any
change in President Bush's oft-stated opposition to gun control.
   More than 110,000 assault-type weapons with pending applications
for import will be affected, according to the announcement by the
new national drug control director, William J. Bennett.
   The action does not affect weapons already in this country, but
blocks import of certain guns unless it can be determined they are
for sporting use, officials said.
   It also does not affect weapons made in the United States, such
as the AR15, the semiautomatic, civilian version of the .223-caliber
M-16.
   The administration's decision comes amid a rising chorus of calls
for controlling semiautomatic weapons, which many police officials
say are the weapon of choice for drug pushers. The weapons have been
increasingly used in drug-related shootings, particularly in urban
areas.
   The push for controls on semiautomatics was also given impetus by
the Jan. 17 slaying of five school children in Stockton, Calif., by
Patrick Edward Purdy, who then killed himself. Purdy also injured 29
other children and and one teacher.
   Among the weapons Purdy used as a Chinese-made AK-47
semiautomatic, which he had purchased at an Oregon gun store.
   Before Tuesday, Bush had not indicated any willingness to move
against the proliferation of semiautomatic weapons except to say he
wanted Bennett to study various options.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the move
reflected no change in Bush's opposition to banning such guns but
merely would enforce current law that allows for import of the guns
only if they are for sporting purposes.
   On Feb. 16, Bush told reporters he would ``strongly oppose'' any
attempt to ban semiautomatic weapons despite public concern over an
increasing number of homicides, mostly related to drug violence,
involving such guns.
   On March 7, Bush told a news conference that he had asked Bennett
to look into what could be done about AK-47s, one type of
semiautomatic rifle, but that he wanted to find a way to ``still do
what's right by the legitimate sportsman.''
   He said solving the problem was ``not as easy as it seems.''
   Tuesday's news release in Bennett's name said that Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, who has jurisdiction over the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, ``decided to suspend, effective
immediately, the importation of several makes of assault-type
weapons pending a decision as to whether these weapons are, as
required by law, `particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to
sporting purposes.'''
   Bush, a longtime member of the National Rifle Association,
``shares the public concern,'' over the proliferation of
semiautomatic weapons, said Fitzwater.
   Applications so far this year to import such weapons already have
passed the total of the previous three years, Bennett said.
   The new policy was announced late in the afternoon, and White
House officials directed questions about it to Bennett's office,
though saying they were not trying to take the spotlight off Bush.
   Bush had asked Bennett, who on Monday officially was sworn in as
the nation's ``drug czar,'' to take the lead on looking into ways to
address the problem, Fitzwater noted.
   He said it was coincidence that the move came a day after the
California State Assembly passed a sweeping ban on 40 types of
semiautomatics.
   The National Rifle Association, which has opposed limits on
semiautomatic weapons, reacted with caution to the move, saying it
would ``put a stop to the media hysteria surrounding the
semiautomatic version of the AK-47 rifle, and should provide an
atmosphere for a reasoned and sensible debate on this issue.''
   ``Today's action by the secretary of the treasury, we trust, will
end the rush to come up with ill-conceived and ill-defined
legislative proposals which could turn millions of Americans into
felons and deprive honest citizens of firearms they have lawfully
owned for decades,'' Wayne LaPierre, executive director of the NRA
Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement.
   Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, who is an NRA board member, said,
``The problem is not guns themselves, but the criminal element,'' he
said.
   The administration decision came after conferences among Brady,
Bennett and Stephen E. Higgins, the director of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   Bureau spokesman Dick Pedersen said, ``Higgins and Bennett
together felt it was time to suspend the importation, so we are
doing that.''
   The bureau approved the import of 88,000 semiautomatic weapons
during 1986, 1987 and 1988. This year so far, the government has
received requests to import many more than that _ with 113,732
applications pending for import of AKS-type weapons alone, according
to Bennett's figures.
   Affected by the import suspension are AKS-type weapons including
AK-47s, Uzi carbines, FN-FAL and FN-FNC-type weapons as well as
Steyr Aug semiautomatic weapons.
   Several makes not included are imported only in small numbers and
are ``not a problem,'' said Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
spokeswoman Dot Koester.
   She could not provide a list of weapons made in this country that
would fall under the category of assault rifle.
   ``ATF has the authority to regulate the importation of weapons
into the United States, to make sure they fall into certain
categories,'' Pedersen said. ``We're saying some of these weapons
may not fall into some of the prescribed categories, such as
hunting.''
   The administration's move brought praise from Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who has introduced legislation to ban new
assault weapons in the United States and to require registration of
such weapons already in circulation.
   ``This is a major first step but currently nothing prevents the
manufacture of these weapons here in the United States,'' Metzenbaum
said.

   A problem with a hydrogen tank
aboard the space shuttle Discovery forced its astronauts to conserve
energy Tuesday and threatened to shorten the mission, but Mission
Control said there was no threat to the crew.
   The five crew members monitored scientific experiments and
photographed environmental damage on the Earth, a day after they
roared into orbit and launched a key NASA communications satellite.
   The problem was an erratic pressure reading in one of three
hydrogen tanks and in its manifold, which carries the hydrogen to
fuel cells. The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in the fuel cells
to produce electricity for shuttle systems, with water as a
byproduct.
   ``There are no safety problems associated with it and no
electrical problems,'' ground control capsule communicator Mike
Baker told the astronauts.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration flight director
Chuck Shaw said Tuesday night that ground controllers hoped to solve
the problem by turning the tank back on Wednesday morning using only
one of its two heaters. Controllers expected to turn the tank on
around 9 a.m. CST.
   ``I think things will work out just fine with the heater
tomorrow,'' Shaw said, adding that the tank will be thoroughly
checked after being put back in operation.
   Shaw said a similar erratic reading on the same hydrogen tank was
noticed on Discovery's flight last fall, but said there had been no
fluctuation noted on the manifold reading.
   The erratic reading, he said, was believed to be associated with
how the hydrogen is heated and then pushed out of the tank to the
fuel cells.
   Earlier Tuesday, flight director Granvil Pennington said that if
the problem couldn't be resolved and Discovery had to continue to
use only two hydrogen tanks, the shuttle may land Friday instead of
Saturday.
   ``Right now, we're still planning to land on Saturday,''
Pennington said. He said NASA could wait as late as Thursday before
deciding to end the mission a day early.
   Without that third tank, the shuttle might not have electricity
to support a five-day flight plus two days for any contingencies.
Discovery currently is scheduled to land Saturday at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif., at 6:34 a.m. PST.
   The other two hydrogen tanks continued feeding the shuttle's fuel
cells and the crew took steps to save electricity. Unnecessary
lights were turned off as well as some redundant computers and two
data display screens.
   After the ``powering down'' Tuesday morning, the crew continued
with planned tasks such as monitoring experiments and photographing
environmentally damaged such as the rain forests of Brazil and the
Mexican coastline.
   Pennington said the crew's power conservation efforts would not
hurt the experiments.
   On Monday, several hours after Discovery's liftoff, the crew
completed their primary task _ deployment of a $100 million Tracking
Data and Relay Satellite to complete a communications network that
will allow shuttle astronauts to have nearly constant contact with
Mission Control.
   The satellite joins one fully functioning and one backup TDRS in
orbit 22,300 miles above the Earth to relay radio communications
between shuttles and the Earth during 85 percent of each orbit.
   Using ground relay stations, radio contact is possible only when
the shuttle is roughly above each station, a total of about 15
percent of each orbit.
   The space agency will soon close six ground stations at a monthly
savings of $3 million.
   Also on board Discovery are four rats, who each had a leg bone
cut before the launch. The student experiment is designed to study
how bones heal in space.
   Another student experiment aboard the shuttle consists of
fertilized chicken eggs stored in an incubator. The experiment is
aimed at determining whether an embryo can develop normally in zero
gravity.
   During the afternoon, NASA television showed spectacular footage
of the Hawaiian Islands taken by a camera in the payload bay. Later,
shots of a moon glowing in the black sky and lightning around the
Earth could be seen.
   NASA television also showed astronauts Robert C. Springer and Dr.
James M. Bagian in the shuttle middeck checking on an experiment on
how roots grow in space.
   Overheating problems cropped up with the root experiment and a
cooling system being tested in the shuttle cargo bay. The cooling
system, which uses vaporized ammonia to carry heat from shuttle
systems out to space, was shut down early so ground engineers could
study the problem.
   In addition, an electronic facsimile machine being tested on the
shuttle had problems receiving messages from the ground to the crew.
When controllers sent 35 pages, some of the papers coming out of the
machine were folded, Mission Control commentator Billie Deason said.
   Early Tuesday, ground controllers awakened the crew by playing
James Brown's rowdy song, ``I Got You (I Feel Good).'' Brown, the
``Godfather of Soul,'' is serving a six-year prison term in South
Carolina for charges stemming from a two-state auto chase.
   ``We're trying to figure out how you got James Brown out on
parole to sing that to us,'' said Discovery commander Mike Coats.
   ``That was just a special appearance,'' replied capsule
communicator David Low in Mission Control. ``We thought that was
very appropriate music. You've got the whole ground team here
feeling real good.''
   Discovery's other crew members are pilot John E. Blaha, and
mission specialist James F. Buchli.
   It is the 28th shuttle mission and the third since Challenger was
destroyed and its seven astronauts were killed more than three years
ago.

<HEAD>Blame Overlapping Messages for Jet Crash in Azores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>

   The February crash of an
American-chartered jetliner in the Azores that claimed 144 lives
probably was caused by overlapping radio messages, the government
reported Tuesday.
   It said the Boeing 707 apparently was flying at an altitude of
about 2,000 feet instead of 3,000 feet when it crashed into the
fog-covered Pico Alto mountain, killing all aboard.
   The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications gave
this account of the overlapping messages:
   The control tower authorized the pilot to descend to 3,000 feet,
advised him which runway to use and asked him to renew contact when
the plane was at 3,000 feet.
   But at the same time the tower was sending the message the pilot
was radioing plans to descend to 2,000 feet.
   Neither the pilot nor tower heard the other's message and the jet
continued on its fatal course.
   ``The plane hit ... in a zone where flying is not permitted below
an altitude of 3,000 feet,'' the report said.
   The plane, owned by Independent Air Corp. of Smyrna, Tenn., was
carrying Italian tourists on their way to the Caribbean with a stop
at the Azores island of Santa Maria when the accident occurred Feb.
8.
   The report said the investigating commission found no indication
of mechanical or technical failure of the plane and ruled out
sabotage or other criminal action.
   Traffic controllers at the tower did give the jet's crew an
atmospheric pressure reading of 1,027 millibars instead of the
correct 1,108.7 millibars, according to the report. It said the
difference in pressure readings would mean the jet's altimeters told
the pilot he was 240 feet above his actual position.

   Rebel sympathizers vandalized
telephones, spray-painted graffiti and commandeered buses Tuesday as
they marched through the capital to support a guerrilla boycott of
the presidential election.
   The guerrillas' Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front has
called for a boycott of Sunday's election and threatened election
workers who take part. Their clandestine Radio Venceremos warned
anew that the rebels are ready to enforce a ban on traffic
throughout the nation beginning Thursday.
   ``Elections with repression aren't elections,'' read banners
carried Tuesday by peasants, workers and students from the Bread,
Land, Jobs and Liberty Movement, which supports the Farabundo Marti
in its war against the U.S.-backed government.
   Fidel Chavez Mena, presidential nominee of the incumbent
Christian Democratic Party, told a news conference, ``The FMLN has
no right to keep the people from voting.''
   The guerrillas are no longer ``the Robin Hoods they used to be.
They no longer have popular support,'' he said.
   The nine-year war has killed about 70,000 people, most of them
civilians.
   Honduran Col. Reynaldo Andino Flores told a news conference in
Tegucigalpa, the capital of neighboring Honduras, on Tuesday that
members of the Farabundo Marti have set up training camps in
Honduran territory.
   Andino Flores, commander of the 105th Infantry Brigade, accused
the Salvadoran rebels of using refugee camps in Honduras to train
Honduran and Salvadorans in guerrilla combat.
   He also charged that Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista army has been
using the camps to transport arms to the Salvadoran rebels.
   Honduran officials have charged in the past that the Farabundo
Marti has used the camps occupied by Salvadoran refugees to train
troops.
   ``The connection that exists between the FMLN and Nicaragua's
Sandinista army is evident,'' Andino Flores said.
   He said the Farabundo Marti operates out of six different points
along the El Salvador-Honduras border.
   Andino Flores said his men found in the camps ``leftist elements
dedicated to making war equipment and storing medicines for the
FMLN.''
   For eight years, more than 20,000 Salvadorans have lived in
refugee border camps in Colomoncagua, 335 miles west of Tegucigalpa.
   In El Salvador, the guerrillas continued weeklong attacks on
electrical installations Monday, blowing up power poles and
transformers. Half of this small Central American country was
without power Tuesday, a spokesman for the electric company said.
   Many of Tuesday's 700 demonstrators marched quietly. Others _
gripping tape-wrapped steel bars, their faces covered with
handkerchiefs _ spray-painted slogans on walls and pavement
denouncing the elections and the United States.
   When they ran low on paint, several helped themselves to more at
hardware stores. Shopkeepers said they took without paying.
   A pharmacy was robbed of pills, telephones in a fast-food
restaurant were smashed, buses were sprayed with slogans and seized
by demonstrators.
   Asked why he was marching, a 9-year-old replied softly, ``For the
revolution.''
   The Farabundo Marti offered to participate in the elections and
recognize the results if voting was postponed and other conditions
were met. It considered the government response inadequate and
demanded a boycott.
   A few hours after the march, several thousand Salvadorans held a
more peaceful election protest in the plaza in front of the hulking,
still-unfinished cathedral.
   ``Elections in wartime are elections for the war,'' people
chanted, waving flags with the blue and white national colors.
``Dialogue and negotiation for peace in El Salvador.''
   The rally was organized by the Permanent Committee for A National
Debate, a church-sponsored effort to find a peaceful end to the war.
   Urban guerrillas ambushed a Treasury Police patrol and wounded
three men late Monday. Other rebels stopped a soft drink truck and
set it afire Tuesday.
   Noise bombs exploded throughout the capital, sending thousands of
pamphlets into the air urging an election boycott.
   Persistent electrical outages and vandalism have increased
support for the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, known as
Arena. Its candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, is favored to win the
election.
   Chavez Mena said a ``vote for Arena is a vote for the FMLN
because the FMLN has said it would rather fight the extreme right
because it feels it can win.
   ``Arena will polarize the country.''
   Neither party, nor the third-running leftist Democratic
Convergence, is expected to win a first-round victory Sunday. If
needed, a runoff would be held in April.

   Eastern Airlines won court approval Tuesday for a plan to help
ticket holders grounded by the 12-day-old Machinists strike, and
union leaders offered to return to work under congressional orders
even with drastic pay cuts.
   Meanwhile, the national Air Line Pilots Association threw a crimp
into any Eastern effort to sell aircraft or routes by refusing to
fly them for different carriers unless strike-supporting Eastern
pilots are hired for the work.
   In Atlanta, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to
order Eastern pilots to return to work, but set a hearing on March
23 before a three-judge panel to hear full arguments on the
airline's appeal in Tallahassee, Fla.
   And in a labor rally at dusk in Miami, Mary Jane Barry, president
of the Transport Workers Union local representing flight attendants,
told a crowd of 750 that an anti-Continental campaign would be
launched Thursday in Denver, one of the carrier's hubs. She would
not elaborate.
   Eastern launched 94 flights Monday and expected the same number
Tuesday and Wednesday. The airline had been projecting up to 140
flights per day by now, but spokesman Jim Ashlock said, ``We're just
doing what we're doing.''
   ``We don't even think it was that many,'' said pilots association
spokesman J.B. Stokes. ``I think they're being generous to
themselves.''
   The airline had run more than 1,000 flights daily before the
strike by its machinists in a contract dispute over wage concessions.
   The Eastern ticket plan submitted and approved Tuesday under the
airline's Chapter 11 financial reorganization filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York offered a first-class upgrade for
anyone with Eastern tickets and reservations on routes still being
flown.
   Consumers also could hold their tickets until Eastern resumes
flights and get a half-price fare for a companion or obtain coupons
from other airlines, hotels, rental car companies good for the
purchase of their services at discounted prices.
   Sister-carrier Continental Airlines will continue to honor
Eastern tickets, and ``Eastern continues to work with other airlines
to help establish policies for acceptance of Eastern tickets,'' the
company said in a news release.
   Eastern also is seeking permission to pay commissions to travel
agents for the fourth quarter of 1988 _ money that was tied up along
with salaries when the nation's seventh-largest carrier filed for
bankruptcy protection Thursday.
   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., expected a vote on the House floor
Wednesday on his legislation that would require President Bush to
intervene by appointing an emergency panel, as recommended by the
National Mediation Board after 17 months of fruitless talks between
Eastern and the Machinists.
   The measure by Oberstar, chairman of the aviation subcommittee of
the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, would order
Eastern employees back to work at pre-strike salaries and require
the panel to recommend a settlement in 21 days, with the president
having the discretion to add five days.
   But the legislation, even if passed, isn't given much chance of
surviving a presidential veto, and its standing in Bankruptcy Court
is uncertain.
   ``If the government asks us to go back under the imposed rules,
we'll do that,'' Machinists leader Wally Haber said, referring to
wage cuts imposed by Eastern after the strike began. ``We have to
start generating new revenue, and we'll only generate revenue when
we get back to work.''
   Machinists charged that the new wage scales imposed by Eastern
when the strike began are now the lowest in the airline industry.
   Eastern did not address the statement directly, but spokesman
Ashlock said: ``Our work rules are also predicated on what we look
on as industry standards. The union wants to look at comparisons
between airlines. We have to look at the overall marketplace and
say, `For this particular job what are qualified people willing to
take this job for?'''
   The pilots' union is trying to protect its 3,600 Eastern members
by requiring other carriers who buy Eastern assets to hire Eastern
pilots and preserve their seniority. The ALPA also announced a $9
million package of strike benefits ranging from $2,400 a month in
strike benefits to interest-free loans to cover withheld paychecks.
   In bankruptcy court the ALPA asked to transfer Eastern management
from its parent Texas Air Corp. to a trustee, accusing Texas Air
Chairman Frank Lorenzo of stripping Eastern's assets. And the
8,500-member Machinists union asked for $8 million in paychecks due
last Friday and $1 million in insurance premiums due for February
coverage.
   Also Tuesday:
   _The Communications Workers of America board approved a $100,000
contribution to support Eastern strikers. The union also urged its
700,000 members to donate $2 a month through local unions for the
strikers.
   _The American Association of Travel Agents urged Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner to set up a plan for refunds to Eastern
ticket holders and said he should order other airlines to accept the
tickets.
   _U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan refused to let the
Eastern strike spread to a Philadelphia-area commuter railroad that
carries 90,000 passengers a day.
   _Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis threw his support to strikers
at a rally in Boston Tuesday night by 1,000 Eastern machinists and
sympathizers. ``You've got a governor who's a union member and proud
of it,'' said Dukakis.
   Also attending the rally were National Organization for Women
President Molly Yard, Mayor Raymond Flynn and Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy.

   The National Assembly on Tuesday
approved amnesty for 1,933 former members of the national guard,
most of whom had been jailed since the Sandinista revolution
overthrew the Somoza dynasty in July 1979.
   Among those given amnesty were 39 former guardsmen, including
three lieutenant colonels, whose names did not appear on a list of
1,894 prisoners that President Daniel Ortega recommended be granted
amnesty.
   Ortega announced at a celebration of the Sandinista revolution
last month that he would recommend that the assembly grant the
amensties.
   The prisoners are to be released in a ceremony on Sunday at the
prison in Tipitapa, 14 miles east of the capital. Joao Baena Soares,
secretary-general of the Organization of American States, is
expected to attend. Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo may also be there.
   The Sandinista-dominated legislature approved the mass amnesty,
68-4, with two members abstaining.
   The vote came after an intense five-hour debate, during which the
opposition argued for the amnesty of those on the original list
submitted by Ortega, along with 39 others.
   Several Sandinista deputies argued against the release, saying
the prisoners committed unpardonable crimes when they served under
President Anastasio Somoza .
   Somoza fled Managua on July 17, 1979, two days before the
Sandinstas marched triumphantly into the capital. He was later
assassinated in exile.
   The National Assembly's Committee on Human Rights and Peace had
examined the list and earlier determined that 39 prisoners had
committed ``atrocious crimes'' against the Nicaraguan people and
``had not demonstrated will to change their ways.''
   But during Tuesday's debate, opposition representatives noted
that the Organization of American State's Inter-American Commission
on Human Rights had recommended that the leftist Sandinista
government free all jailed former guardsmen.
   The assembly approved the additional 39 cases even though their
amensty is sure to be challenged by authorities, legislators said.
   The amnesty is the result of accords reached by Central American
presidents in El Salvador on Feb. 14.
   After the meeting, Ortega promised to institute democratic
reforms and move up the presidential elections to February 1990, 10
months earlier than scheduled.
   The presidents also agreed to draft a plan within 90 days to
dismantle the U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebel force now living in
Honduras.
   The assembly approved the amnesty with the understanding ``that
the freeing of the prisoners will contribute to creating conditions
for the demobilization, relocation and repatriation of those
Nicaraguans who have been involved in either indirect or direct
armed activities in Honduran territory.''
   Relatives of jailed guardsmen pleaded for their release in
Tuesday's debate.
   Rosa Maria Herrera, wife of jailed former guardsman Juan de Dios
Herrera, sobbed quietly when the assembly approved her husband's
release.
   Her sister, two brothers-in-laws and a cousin also will be freed
under the amnesty. ``They were innocent,'' she said.
   Sandinsta deputy Danilo Aguirre Solis opposed the amnesty and
said despite it, ``the Nicaraguan people will never forget their
crimes.''
   He said those being let go were responsible for the deaths of
about 50,000 Nicaraguans during the revolution.

   Several television ministries whose finances
are being audited by the Internal Revenue Service in the wake of the
PTL scandal are in danger of losing their federal tax exemptions,
the IRS says.
   Loss of the exemptions would mean future contributors could not
claim tax deductions for donations to those ministries.
   The IRS investigated 23 TV ministries during the last quarter of
1988, the agency said in a report to Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas,
chairman of the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee. Pickle
made parts of the report public on Monday.
   ``The service is continuing to devote significant examination
resources to media evangelist cases,'' Robert I. Brauer, assistant
commissioner for exempt organizations, said in a cover letter to
Pickle. He identified six of those cases as involving prominent TV
evangelists.

   Congress' auditing agency today attacked the
government's 1988 spree of savings and loan sales as too costly and
said it would have been cheaper in a third of the deals reviewed to
shut down the institutions and pay off depositors.
   Charles A. Bowsher, comptroller general of the General Accounting
Office, said in testimony prepared for the Senate Banking Committee
that S&amp;L regulators required the purchasers to invest too little of
their own money.
   Officials at the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which
guarantees S&amp;L deposits up to $100,000, also underestimated, by 20
percent to 40 percent, the value of tax breaks offered to buyers,
Bowsher said.
   The report comes as White House and Treasury Department officials
are reviewing a complex financing plan aimed at protecting regional
economies from the precipitous sale of billions of dollars of real
estate now in government hands as a result of S&amp;L failures.

   One of the ultimate insiders in the 1988
presidential race, Sen. Paul Simon, offers blunt observations on his
own campaign and those of his Democratic rivals in a new book being
released today.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. came off as brash, Bruce Babbitt eventually
became desperate, Gary Hart was a dull speaker and Michael Dukakis
was too remote, a flaw fatal to his campaign, Simon writes in
``Winners and Losers.''
   ``It is a candid observation about the weaknesses and strengths
of all of them _ and of myself,'' Simon, D-Ill., said in a recent
interview. ``I didn't hesitate criticizing myself and some of my
weaknesses in the campaign.''
   In the book, Simon faults himself for several tactical errors,
but more importantly, for failing to build his campaign around a
``central theme'' that would have been easily accessible to the
voters.

putting the political pieces together today after his government,
its credibility damaged by a financial scandal, defeated a censure
motion in Parliament.
   The vote just before midnight Monday was 155-123.
   It followed three days of raucous and often angry debate and
charges by Papandreou that the United States has tried to encourage

   The censure motion was filed by the conservative New Democracy

   The operative word in ABC's ``The Women of
Brewster Place'' is women.
   The two-part movie, airing Sunday and Tuesday, is based on the
1982 novel by Gloria Naylor and follows the stories of seven women
who wind up living on the blighted, dead-end Chicago street in the
1960s. It boasts a stellar, mostly female cast, a woman writer and a
woman director.
   Men who tune will see their gender portrayed as mostly bullies,
brutes and no-account losers. One of the only nice guys in the movie
winds up getting beat with a two-by-four wielded by a lesbian who's
been assaulted by a drug dealer.
   This occurs near the end of the movie, after it has sunk into too
much syrupy melodrama and heavy-handed symbolism, a disappointing
turn of events, since Part One promised an engrossing and thoughtful
drama.
   The movie stars Oprah Winfrey _ who is co-executive producer with
Carole Isenberg _ Cicely Tyson, Mary Alice, Olivia Cole, Robin
Givens, Moses Gunn, Jackee, Paula Kelly, Lonette McKee, Barbara
Montgomery, Phyllis Yvonne Stickney, Douglas Turner Ward, Lynn
Whitfield and Paul Winfield.
   Scriptwriter Karen Hall (``The Betty Ford Story'') adapted the
novel for the screen. Donna Deitch (``Desert Hearts'') directed.
   The first character we meet is Mattie Michael (Winfrey), a
Tennessee farm girl who becomes pregnant by a roving farmhand and
flees the wrath of her father (Winfield).
   Mary Alice (``Fences'') has a brief but powerful role as Mattie's
mother, who stands up to her enraged husband. Leveling a shotgun at
him, she declares, ``So help me, Jesus, you hit my child again, and
I'll see your soul in hell!''
   Cicely Tyson also appears only briefly in another memorable
scene. She plays a well-to-do matron whose daughter (Robin Givens)
has rejected her middle-class upbringing, taken an African name,
Kiswana, and moved to Brewster Place to be among ``my people.''
   When the daughter refuses to answer to her given name, Melanie,
her mother explodes, ``I named you after my grandmother who bore
nine children and educated them all, who held off five white men
with a shotgun when they tried to take one of her sons to jail. And
you had to reach into an African dictionary to find a name that
would make you proud!''
   Jackee (``227'') plays Etta Mae, Mattie's best friend, a
perpetual party girl who yearns for respectability but refuses to go
second class. Lynn Whitfield (``HeartBeat'') is Ciel, the young
woman Mattie helped raise. She is abandoned by her unemployed
husband after their child dies.
   Phyllis Yvonne Stickney plays a harried young unwed mother with a
houseful of neglected children. Paula Kelly and Lonette McKee play
lesbian lovers who have moved into the tenement in hopes of blending
into the neighborhood.
   The story exists in a world virtually devoid of contact with
whites. Black men are the heavies, though the script does attempt to
give them motivations for beating and abandoning their women.
   Mattie's father, enraged that his dreams for his daughter have
been thwarted, beats her senseless. Her son, fearful of white
non-justice, skips bail on a manslaughter charge, causing his mother
to lose her home. Etta Mae is seduced by a hypocritical minister.
Ciel's husband can't face the burden of a second child, so she has
an abortion she doesn't want.
   The only nice guys to speak of are the tenement's kind handyman,
Ben (Moses Gunn), and Kiswana's enlightened boyfriend, Abshu (Leon).
   By Part Two, Olivia Cole is busy overdoing it as a cartoonish
Miss Sophie, the resident prune-face and gossip. By then, the story
has sunk into soapy melodrama, interspersed with clumsy attempts to
make the wall that plugs up Brewster Place a symbol of oppression.
   Ultimately, ``The Women of Brewster Place'' is not the great
drama it aspires to be, but it is a pretty good soap opera.

   Individuals have easy access to credit and
business has big profits to use, so the 76-month-old economic
expansion _ an old-timer by most standards _ is springing forward
like an upstart.
   The economy's strength, which might even be growing, continues in
spite of efforts by the Federal Reserve to restrain economic
activity through higher interest rates and in defiance of repeated
forecasts of an imminent slowdown.
   The level of activity has spread doubt among forecasters.
``Forecasts of a slower economy are just that, forecasts,'' says J.
Patrick Bradley of PNC Financial Corp. ``We must admit, few signs of
a slower economy can be found.''
   Among the latest reports of economic strength is an updated
survey by the National Federation of Independent Business that shows
small business optimism in February was the highest for that month
in four years.
   The survey, based on an opinion sampling of the federation's
500,000-plus business members, shows companies are able to withstand
higher interest rates by financing internally through profits rather
than by borrowing from banks.
   ``Remarkable profit gains continue to keep regular borrowing
activity at near-record low levels,'' said survey founder William
Dunkelberg, economist and dean of Temple University's school of
business.
   Dunkelberg points out that smaller businesses are aware of rising
interest rates and clearly expect financing to become more difficult
and expensive, but for the time being have been shielded from
credit-restraint efforts.
   A vaguely similar thesis has been offered to explain the
continued use of increasingly costly credit by consumers. Credit is
so available, according to the thesis, that the temptation to borrow
is much stronger than a decade ago.
   Perhaps the most significant of consumer credit changes is
development of the home equity loan, which often carries with it a
tax deduction for interest paid. Moreover, housing inflation has
made relatively large sums available.
   Whatever the reason, the University of Michigan's consumer
sentiment index, made up of attitudes toward existing and
anticipated economic conditions, rose strongly from December to
January.
   In the business sector, Dunkelberg termed the optimism
surprisingly strong.
   Twenty-two percent of respondents to the small-business survey
agreed in February that ``now is a good time to expand,'' up from 16
percent a year earlier. Only 12 percent thought the economy would
weaken, while 24 percent indicated they expected it to improve.
   ``These figures represent a substantial turnaround in the outlook
for the economy,'' he said, adding significantly:
   ``In spite of the unprecedented length of the recovery, the
outlook is for further improvements in the economy rather than a
leveling of economic activity or a recession.''
   That optimism was reflected in plans to build inventories, which
the 15-year-old survey showed were at record highs for the month,
and in hiring plans and job openings, which reached a four-year high.
   Dunkelberg said that although plans to raise prices continued to
fall from the expansion high reached in December 1988, when 32
percent of all respondents had such plans, the percentage reporting
actual price increases continued to rise.
   ``Planned or unplanned,'' he said, ``this translates into higher
inflation rates.''

<HEAD>Japanese Consider Importing U.S. College Education</HEAD>

   The Japanese balk at importing American beef and
rice, but they might be ready to import U.S. college educations.
   Supporters of the idea have almost utopian visions of a future in
which American colleges here add to international understanding,
reduce trade frictions, break the stuffy mold of Japanese higher
education and produce more Japanese world citizens.
   Southern Illinois University opened a branch campus last spring
and says it is faring well with about 450 Japanese in intensive
English courses.
   ``Things look quite bright and we're pretty much on schedule,''
said Jared Dorn, director of the project that in May moves from
temporary housing in a youth center to a custom-built campus.
   More than 150 American colleges and universities have expressed
interest in branch campuses in Japan in the past two years, but
perhaps only a dozen will succeed.
   A strong Japanese proponent of importing education is Chikara
Higashi, the president of Temple University's 2,000-student branch
in Tokyo and a member of Parliament from the governing Liberal
Democratic Party. Philadelphia-based Temple has had a branch here
since 1982 and offers a full, four-year degree course.
   In recent years Japan has opened up industry, banks, stockbrokers
and pharmaceuticals to more foreign competition, Higashi said in an
interview.
   ``Education should be the first to be internationalized, but it
is the last.''
   Japanese education is effective in its early years, he said.
   ``But when Japan is a leading country and is asked to play a
larger world role, we need Japanese who can communicate and take
leadership in international communities. We lack that.''
   Almost every week, American and Japanese educators visit the
Southern Illinois University branch in Nakajo, a town of 30,000
people 150 miles north of Tokyo, or the mother campus in Carbondale,
Ill., Dorn said by telephone from Nakajo.
   ``They are all going very slowly, waiting to see what happens
with us and others.''
   They are ``inching toward agreements,'' he added.
   The branch-campus wavelet, despite doubts in the Ministry of
Education, has political backing in Tokyo and Washington.
   The top U.S. sponsor is Richard Gephardt, the Missouri
congressman who sought the Democratic presidential nomination last
year on a platform critical of Japanese trade surpluses.
   But Gephardt says his objective is to find ways to help Americans
export more to Japan and make the two countries better understand
each other. Gephardt is co-chairman of the USA-Japan Committee for
Promoting Trade Expansion, a group of U.S. congressmen and members
of Japan's Parliament, the Diet. The committee coordinates the
mating of U.S. colleges and host towns.
   Yusuke Kataoka, executive director of the Tokyo office of
Gephardt's committee, said Japanese university graduates are
ill-suited to an outward-looking era in which Japan has major world
responsibilities.
   American branch campuses, Kataoka said, will be ``a kind of
perestroika (the Soviet term for restructuring) to break through the
inbreeding of the Japanese higher-education system.''
   U.S. higher education is ``more practical, broader, more
cosmopolitan,'' he said.
   Japan is renowned for turning out diligent students who top world
rankings in math and science tests. But that applies mostly to grade
school and high school; university years are often spent gaining
friends and a diploma useful in one's career and concentrating on a
narrow field without studying hard.
   By contrast, a U.S. college education is regarded here as hard
work and broad training that develops a more rounded and creative
adult than Japan's system, which produces gifted team workers but
not so many precedent-setters.
   For example, only two Japanese scientists have won Nobel Prizes
in physics and chemistry since 1970, while 39 Americans have been
honored for basic research _ an area where Japan lags the United
States.
   Japanese education is also notorious for the inability of
graduates to speak English, and this is where the American campuses
see their toehold.
   The typical plan is a year of intensive English, followed by two
years of general college education _ all taught in English by
professors from U.S. institutions. Then successful students can
transfer their credits to the mother college or a related
institution in the United States and earn a U.S. bachelor's degree
in two more years.
   After the campuses establish themselves, they also would offer
courses on Japan and related topics to American students.
   But that is in the future.
   So far, said Kataoka of the Gephardt committee, four U.S.
universities are lined up to follow Southern Illinois into Japan:
Texas A&amp;M, Oklahoma State University, the Minnesota state
universities system and Mississippi State University.
   Ministry of Education officials tend to doubt U.S. colleges will
succeed. Yoshiyuki Nishizawa, head of an office to promote
educational and cultural exchanges in the ministry, said it may be
hard to attract students because graduates will not receive the
Japanese university degree that is often essential for getting a
good job.
   ``And if a student fails to learn English and doesn't get to go
to the United States, he will have nothing for two years' work,''
Nishizawa said, adding that it will be hard for the branches to
maintain strong faculties.
   But he conceded that some parents are more interested in having
their children study abroad than before.
   Graduates of Temple-Japan have no trouble landing good jobs,
President Higashi said, and their success may have paved the way for
the growth of U.S. college branches.
   ``So we will be happy to see more universities come, but it will
be difficult.''

<HEAD>Activists, Weather and Supply Mean Trouble for Danish Mink Farms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Denmark, the world's top breeder of
minks for fashion, pelts are selling at below break-even prices this
season. More than just prices are depressed.
   Overproduction, warm weather and a long campaign by animal rights
activisits have pushed many of Denmark's 5,000 mink farms to the
brink of bankruptcy.
   ``The stock market crash started it,'' said Scott Novak, who
represents a New York dealer in exclusive garments, who was here for
an international auction. ``That seemed to end that beautiful run we
had for a few years.''
   It's too early to look for bargains in buying a mink coat off the
rack, however. Sewing the furs into garments is skilled work and
labor costs along with retailers' markups are high, but prices might
drop later on.
   Danish breeders produce 35 percent of all mink furs sold in the
West. Last year 12.4 million mink pelts were sold, up from 9.1
million in 1986. At the same time, falling prices reduced income
from $394 million to $282 million.
   It's hard to determine the damage done by the animal activists,
who at times have sprayed paint on the fur coats of women in the
street.
   ``Certainly they hurt us,'' said Lester Taffer, a 59-year veteran
of the trade. ``They murdered us in Germany and other places.''
   The protests began in the 1960s to save animals in the wild from
trappers, but the scope later widened to breeding animals for their
fur.
   Skimming 0.6 percent of the turnover at auctions, the
London-based International Fur Trade Federation finances a
counter-campaign to promote the fur industry in brochures and films.
   A global fraternity of fur buyers assembled in February near
Copenhagen to bid for raw materials that will become the luxurient
apparel in shops in the fall. The Danish auction house offers the
largest collection of mink pelts in the world.
   Minks were fetching between $15 and $34 per pelt. Two seasons
ago, amid surging garment sales, the same types of pelts brought up
to 45 percent more.
   Mink production has set records.
   ``This year we'll be grading more than 15 million pelts, four
times that of the next largest fur center,'' Peter Krag, president
of Danish Fur Sales, said in an interview.
   Pelts are graded according to sex, size, color, clarity and
quality, creating hundreds of categories.
   The fur business has grown in the last 15 years from small
handicraft shops to a mass-production industry. The Far East
supplies an estimated 40 percent of finished product.
   Danish fur farming began in the 1920s with wild mink imported
from North America and fed on the abundance of fish caught in Danish
waters.
   After World War II mink production rose steadily, and Denmark
rose to become the world leader. Production has tripled since 1980.
Now the glut of mink pelts is threatening many breeders.
   Two warm winters in a row have added to furriers' woes. Everyone
in the trade is praying for an extended late-winter cold snap to
stimulate demand for fur clothing.
   Recovery from the slump in fur sales demands at least two
radically improved seasons. Even a 10 percent reduction would not
raise prices unless demand soars.
   ``The important thing is that sales companies are meeting the
market,'' said William Frick, who represents a major Hong Kong
company.
   ``Hong Kong and other large consumers of raw pelts have thus far
been purchasing conservatively, protecting themselves against a
further drop in prices. Eventually, when the market gains confidence
and orders are placed, we'll see a turnover of garments we've never
seen before. Low prices today will benefit tomorrow's consumer,'' he
said.

   If one had to sum up the quick-change artistry of
``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' in one word, that word might be _
Velcro.
   The way Velcro opens and closes at a touch helps make it possible
for two dressers to whiz actor Jason Alexander through a 10-second
costume change. That's all the time it takes for him to turn from an
ancient Roman in ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum''
into a 1912 dandy for ``High Button Shoes.''
   One of the secrets of how Alexander, who has the lead role of The
Setter, can change so fast is that his high-button shoes don't
button. To save time, they're rigged with zippers.
   ``I think the audience loves quick changes. It's like magic to
them,'' said Barbara Matera, owner of Barbara Matera Ltd., the shop
that made the costumes.
   Velcro, a fabric with a surface of clinging pile, is ``a very big
word in our vocabulary,'' said the show's supervising costume
designer, Joseph Aulisi.
   With nearly 400 costumes in the show and with a cast of 51
performers and 11 understudies doing production numbers from 11
musicals, there are lots of magical quick changes every night. In
fact there are so many of them that sometimes the entire cast is
backstage whipping clothes off and on, he said. Twenty dressers help.
   Because the critically-acclaimed show is a pastiche of old
Broadway musicals that Robbins has either directed or choreographed
or both, there's enough variety to send a costume maker reaching for
a headache powder.
   The musicals are as disparate as ``The King and I,'' set in Siam
in the 1860s, and ``West Side Story,'' set in Manhattan in the '50s.
   Matera recently talked about some of the quick-change tricks
besides Velcro and zippers she and Aulisi employ to help the singers
and dancers assume identities from 11 different times and places.
   One trick is to dress the cast members in layers that peel off to
reveal the costume for the next number. But for dancers, it's not
too comfortable to perform under bright lights as well as layers of
fabric.
   Another ``behind-the-seams'' secret is to line clothes with a
slippery fabric so they slide easily on and off.
   And some belts aren't what they appear to be on stage. They're
not threaded through belt loops, but sewn right onto the pants. ``If
a costume consists of various parts you have to sort of bash them
all together,'' Matera said.
   Barbara Matera Ltd. has about 30 employees most of the time, but
has given work to as many as 100 people at one time when there's a
lot to do.
   While the company was costuming ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' it
also did a full-length version of ``Swan Lake'' for the American
Ballet Theater, and the road company versions of ``Anything Goes''
and ``Into the Woods.''
   Costume work is seasonal and year-round jobs are few. ``The New
York Theatrical Sourcebook'' lists 55 costume craftsmen and 20
costume shops in Manhattan and Brooklyn. However, only four or five
of the shops are highly regarded mainstays, said Carrie Robbins,
master teacher of costuming at New York University and a free-lance
costume designer.
   Most costume shop employees are drapers or a designer's
assistant, tailor or finisher, and do not make much money. If they
land a full-time job, they make about $18,000-$26,000.
   ``They do it because they love theater and love making
costumes,'' said Robbins.
   It's not a soft job, either.
   ``You go to sleep with bloody hands. It's very tiring on your
hands and your arms and your shoulders,'' said Maggie Raywood, the
workroom supervisor at Parsons-Meares Ltd., another of the top
costume shops.
   Parsons-Meares employees should know. They're the ones who made
the costumes for the Broadway musical, ``Starlight Express,'' in
which the train-car costumes starred as much as the cast did.
Parsons-Meares found unusual fabrics and invented new constructions
for the costumes, which looked like metal but moved like leotards.
   The getup for one ``Starlight'' character even incorporated a
strobe light which the actor could flash by bringing together his
forefinger and thumb. The back of the glove was made of rubber to
protect him from shock.
   The designs were worked up from scratch.
   However, in the case of ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' the designs
already existed. Aulisi said he recreated the originals as
faithfully as possible. Matera said in some cases they were aided by
the discovery of the designers' old renderings with swatches of
fabric still stapled on.
   However, Aulisi said, ``Jerry was quite concerned that the show
be relevant to the '80s.'' So some stretch fabrics were used to give
an '80s fit and style that emphasized the dancers' bodies.
   One thing that didn't change from the original show was the
beaded silk organza butterfly that decorates the crotch of a
stripper, Tessie, in a number from ``Gypsy.''
   Matera went to some lengths to recreate it, even calling upon the
actress who originated the role on Broadway, Maria Karnilova, for
advice. Matera wanted to make sure it flapped the way it did in the
1959 production. Like Karnilova, the actress now appearing as
Tessie, Faith Prince, makes the butterfly move with a grind of the
hips.
   ``It's weighted in a certain way,'' Matera said. ``It doesn't
exactly flutter. It sort of bumps.''

<HEAD>U.S. Nuclear Power Not Dead But Life-Support May Be Failing</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years after the Three Mile Island reactor
accident in Pennsylvania, nuclear power in America is approaching a
critical crossroad.
   Critics say the nuclear era should be ended in the 1990s to avoid
unnecessary financial and safety risks. Supporters say the industry
must be rejuvenated to preserve an alternative to growing dependence
on fossil fuels such as oil.
   Increasingly, people on both sides are suggesting that unless a
comeback is started soon, the industry will degenerate to the point
of no return. Suppliers of nuclear plant components already are
dropping out of the business and the pool of university-trained
nuclear engineers is shrinking.
   ``It does atrophy, and it is more serious than it might seem,''
said Larry Hobart, executive director of the American Public Power
Association, a Washington-based trade group representing publicly
owned utilities, many of which rely on nuclear power.
   Whatever the long-range outcome, few believe atomic power will
contribute much, if anything, to the added generating capacity that
experts say will be needed over the next decade to meet the nation's
growing appetite for electricity.
   No new nuclear plants have been ordered since 1978. All those
ordered after 1974 have been canceled, and experts say more
cancellations are almost certain.
   The question now is: Will another nuclear plant ever be built in
this country?
   ``The major barriers are still there,'' said Alan T. Crane, who
directed an Office of Technology Assessment report on nuclear power
that said major changes in technology, utility management and public
acceptance of nuclear power were needed before the industry could
expect to expand in the 21st century.
   A ripple of encouragement is spreading through the industry as
more public attention is focused on environmental problems
associated with the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal.
Gases from these fuels create a ``greenhouse effect'' that some
scientists say is causing a dangerous warming of the Earth.
   Industry officials say nuclear energy is more environmentally
sound than fossil fuels and can reduce the U.S. reliance on foreign
oil.
   Nuclear foes respond, however, that relatively few power plants
run on oil. They say it would be wiser to address to improve energy
efficiency, increase conservation, pursue ways to burn coal more
cleanly and use more renewable energy sources such as solar and
hydropower.
   President Bush says a national energy policy must include a
reliance on nuclear power, and his support is reflected in the
choice of James D. Watkins as energy secretary. Watkins had
extensive experience in the Navy's nuclear reactor program.
   ``We need nuclear power,'' Bush said at Watkins' swearing-in
March 9.
   In seeking to win public favor for renewed nuclear activity, the
industry asserts that since the partial meltdown of a reactor at
Three Mile Island on March 28, 1979, nuclear plants have become
safer and more efficient. They note that last year, for the first
time, nuclear plants supplied 20 percent of the nation's
electricity, and say that the average dose of radiation per plant
worker has decreased.
   There have been many accidental releases of minor amounts of
radioactivity into the air from nuclear plants since Three Mile
Island, but it is not just the reactors that have hurt the
industry's image. One of the most troubling incidents was at the
Peach Bottom plant, near Delta, Pa., which was shut down by the
government in March 1987 because control room workers were caught
sleeping on the job.
   Industry officials insist the country is better off with a
network of reactors that can help meet electricity needs throughout
the 1990s. But even the biggest boosters acknowledge the future
outlook is clouded.
   ``I don't anticipate that we will order any new nuclear plants in
this century, and in my judgment nobody else will either,'' said
William W. Berry, chairman of Virginia Power, an electric utility
that runs four nuclear plants.
   Virginia Power canceled four planned nuclear reactors, starting
in 1977, initially because of doubts about the need for the
additional power capacity. But recently, with electricity demand
rising rapidly in its service area, the utility faced a choice:
build some new plants or buy power from other suppliers. In a move
that may point to a new trend, it decided to take the latter path.
   Berry and other industry executives, as well as government
regulators, environmentalists and independent analysts, said in
interviews that the reasons for the nuclear downfall are simple: too
costly, too risky, too little public acceptance.
   Industry leaders say federal regulators also are to blame,
although others disagree.
   The Three Mile Island emergency, which was caused in part by
human error, galvanized public concern about the safety of nuclear
power. The seeds of trouble, however, were sown earlier in the
decade with a decline in the growth of energy demand.
   Plant cancellations spread as utilities realized their plans were
too ambitious for an era in which consumers were learning to get by
with less energy. Since the first cancellation in 1972, the scratch
list has grown to 108 _ exactly equal to the number of plants now
licensed to operate at full power.
   When the tide of energy demand began turning in the mid-1980s and
utilities foresaw a need to expand their generating capacity, it
became apparent that public fears about nuclear safety _ not just
economics _ were a major obstacle.
   ``The American people still don't have any trust in the safety of
nuclear power,'' Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said at a recent
conference of state energy officials.
   Though the trust began eroding after the Three Mile Island
incident, many experts believe that even more devastating was the
reactor explosion and fire at Chernobyl in the Soviet Ukraine in
which 31 people were killed by radiation exposure.
   Lester R. Brown, president of the Washington-based Worldwatch
Institute, wrote in a report last month that Chernobyl ``did what
hundreds of studies assessing nuclear technology could never have
done: it made the dangers of nuclear power real.''
   U.S. industry officials say a catastrophe on the scale of
Chernobyl could not happen in this country because American reactors
are designed much differently. Critics say the Soviet accident
points up the unpredictability of nuclear power.
   An Associated Press-Media General poll conducted in January found
support for continued use of nuclear plants now operating, but only
a third of those queried supported building more. One-half said a
serious nuclear accident was likely in the future, and 79 percent
said nuclear safety rules should be more tightly enforced.

   Some opponents of nuclear power have declared the industry dead.
They say that once the current generation of light-water reactors is
retired the nuclear era in the United States will draw to a close. A
few alrecommissioned.
   Michael Mariotte, director of the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service, a sharp critic of the industry, said nuclear power
could be revady are being deived after the turn of the century if the government
helped industry develop a new generation of reactors with extra
safety features, such as the high temperature gas-cooled reactor.
   Another big problem for the industry is waste storage. Sen. J.
Bennett Johnston, D-La., recently said the government's effort to
find a burial site for the 1,700 tons of highly radioactive waste
that accumulates each year at power stations was in shambles.
   Yucca Mountain, Nev., was  put
the number of demonstrators in the Estonian capital at 30,000.
Police said 50,000 people turned out, and organizers claimed from
80,000 to 100,000 participants, Finnish radio reported from Tallinn.
   The protest was organized by Interfront, a group dominated by
ethnic Russians. It called Tuesday in the Estonian party's daily
newspaper Sovietskaya Estonia for people to demonstrate ``against
creeping counterrevolution undermining socialism in Estonia and in
the Baltic region of the U.S.S.R.''
   The group claims the 420,000 ethnic Russians in Estonia are
victims of discrimination. Estonia's parliament, using the greater
autonomy granted local lawmakers under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, voted Jan. 18 to require non-Estonians who work in jobs
where they come into contact with the public to learn Estonian in
four years or face dismissal.
   Interfront wants Russian to be granted the status of an official
state language in Estonia, on a par with Estonian.
   Ethnic Estonians make up 65 percent of the republic's 1.5 million
inhabitants, with ethnic Russians totaling 28 percent.
   Finnish radio said Interfront guaranteed a large turnout in
Tuesday's demonstration by starting the march directly from
factories during working hours. Workers had no choice but to follow
their leaders, the radio said.
   Ms. Saarna said Russian-language schools in Tallinn were given
the day off, and non-Estonian residents of the Baltic republic's
northeast were brought in to the capital to swell the number of
marchers.
   Speaking by telephone from Tallinn, Ms. Saarna said the
demonstrators wound peacefully through the city of 478,000 people,
waving flags and carrying banners that read ``Down with
discrimination'' and ``Give Russian the status of a state language.''
   At a rally held later outside Tallinn's city hall, ``speakers
accused leaders of the (Estonian) Communist Party and government of
being bourgeois nationalists and of carrying out a
counterrevolution,'' Ms. Saarna said.
   She said they did not specifically attack Estonia's party leader,
Vaino Vyalyas, a reformer and Gorbachev protege who was appointed to
the post last summer.
   Banners carried in the march called for ``Friendship among all
peoples of the U.S.S.R.,'' but when one speaker began his address in
Estonian, rather than Russian, listeners whistled and stamped their
feet in protest, Ms. Saarna said.
   Orators demanded an emergency meeting in April of the Estonian
party's policy-making Central Committee, possibly with Gorbachev in
attendance, to halt ``bourgeois nationalism'' and
``counterrevolution,'' Ms. Saarna said.
   Speakers also objected to the decision of Estonia's party and
government to fly the Baltic state's old flag, which had long been
illegal under Soviet rule, from the highest medieval castle tower in
Tallinn, Ms. Saarna said.
   The blue, black and white standard was hoisted at Gherman Tower
on Feb. 24, 71 years after Estonia declared its independence.
Estonia, like its neighbors Latvia and Lithuania, was forcibly
absorbed by the Kremlin in 1940. The flag remains a powerful symbol
of its short-lived independence.
   Speakers at the rally called for the tricolor flag to be hauled
down, ``or at the very least, for the flag of Soviet Estonia to be
placed alongside it,'' Ms. Saarna said.
   If they don't hear within two weeks that their demands have been
met, Interfront members said they would stage a two-hour strike on
April 3, and a daylong work stoppage a week later, Ms. Saarna said.
   However, she said reports circulating in Tallinn said Vyalyas had
met with Gorbachev on Monday, and that Gorbachev expressed support
for the Estonian party's present course.
   Since Gorbachev came to power in March 1985, party and government
leaders in the Baltic have been given more leeway in meeting popular
demands for increased local control over affairs.
   In November, the Estonian parliament declared its sovereignty
over all internal matters. The Presidium of the Moscow-based Supreme
Soviet, the nation's top executive body, declared the action
illegal, but Estonian lawmakers have refused to abide by that
decree, saying their republic's constitution takes precedence.

   Harold Denton is like a rock group that
produces a hit, then is obliged to perform it again and again.
   Denton, 52, was the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's most senior
official sent to the Three Mile Island power station for the
nation's worst commercial nuclear accident.
   His calm, easy manner and frank discussion of what was happening
helped reassure the public while technicians got the crisis under
control.
   Ten years later, he remains an ardent booster of nuclear power.
His career has taken him to nuclear-powered generating plants around
the world _ including two visits to Chernobyl, where an April 1986
accident killed at least 31 people and released a radioactive cloud.
   But people still associate Denton with Three Mile Island.
   ``I'm always introduced _ never can get rid of it _ as TMI
spokesman,'' he recalled during an interview at the agency's
headquarters in this Washington suburb.
   Being a symbol during the uncertainty of the emergency carried
responsibilties. The biggest was that no matter how bad things got,
Denton knew he could not leave.
   ``We had people on our own staff who got too concerned to be
useful and had to return home. They just didn't want to be there,''
he said.
   ``The tension was so high, it's hard to re-create. People would
joke that if they saw a truck being hitched up to my trailer and my
leaving, that would be a distinct clue that it was time to leave,''
he said.
   Recognizing his status as an industry spokesman, he returned to
the plant 16 months after the accident to demonstrate his faith in
the safety of venting radioactive krypton gas into the atmosphere.
The gas had escaped into the reactor containment building during the
accident.
   At the time, Denton was the NRC's chief safety officer for
reactors, a post he held until becoming director of the agency's
governmental and public affairs unit in 1987.
   It is his new job overseeing the NRC's international programs
that took him to Chernobyl.
   Denton considers Three Mile Island ``way, way down'' on the
seriousness scale when compared to Chernobyl. ``Very little
radioactivity got out of TMI,'' he said.
   In terms of public safety, Three Mile Island fortunately never
amounted to much, he said.
   ``In retrospect, the biggest threat to health and safety was on
Wednesday. By the time we got there (on Friday), the accident was
over. We just didn't know that,'' he said.
   The damage to the public's confidence in nuclear technology was
another matter, Denton conceded.
   ``I think people's perception for a long time got more and more
negative afterwards as there were allegations of (adverse) health
effects,'' he said. ``Suddenly, people got interested in reporting
events around all reactors, so the perception, I think, of the
public was that the industry was really about to have another TMI at
any moment.''
   But to Denton, the accident was a wakeup call that has made the
industry safer. Reactor operator qualifications have improved,
instruments provide more detail, emergency response is better, and
the NRC has become more adept at managing information, he said.

<HEAD>Decade-Old Debate Continues About Health Effects of Accident</HEAD>

   The radioactive steam that escaped during
the near-disaster at the Three Mile Island power plant has long
since dissipated, but debate over the health effects of the accident
has not.
   Countless pieces of data have been collected about the physical
and psychological symptoms of nearby residents, animal maladies,
plant abnormalities and other problems that might be attributed to
radiation.
   Industry officials, government agencies and residents have
conducted scores of surveys and studies on the radiation's effects.
   The state Health and Agriculture departments said their studies
found no evidence that reported animal and plant problems were due
to the accident. The plant's owner, General Public Utilities Corp.,
said its studies showed not enough radiation was released to cause
the described symptoms.
   Marjorie and Norman Aamodt, who lived about 50 miles from the
plant, listened to the troubles of residents for years. In 1984,
they decided to survey neighborhoods close to Three Mile Island
about symptoms and said they found cancer deaths of up to seven
times greater than expected.
   ``General Public Utilities and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
covered up the enormous suffering of people who were exposed to
intense plumes of radiation,'' Mrs. Aamodt said.
   The state Health Department disputes their contention.
   Dr. George Tokuhata, director of epidemiology for the department,
has overseen about 25 studies on the effects of radiation that
escaped, mostly xenon and krypton gases and a very small quantity of
iodine.
   ``I do not think their worries are warranted, although there are
some disagreements about the amount of radiation released,'' he
said. ``Our studies show radiation release was very low.''
   State researchers estimate that people within fives of the plant
were exposed to 5 to 80 millirem of radiation, depending on how
close the radioactive plumes passed. On the average, the area's
residents are exposed to about 100 millirem of naturally occurring
background radiation each year, Tokuhata said.
   ``If you had 10 millirem, it's a fraction of one chest x-ray,''
he said. ``So you really do not expect a major significant health
impact from that.''
   Tokuhata said the main effect of the accident has been on the
psychological well-being of residents.
   ``... Extra medications taken by pregnant women at the time of
the accident impacted on low birth weight babies,'' he said. ``That
risk was significantly greater among those women who took extra
medications compared to those who did not.''
   Dr. Gordon MacLeod, who took the job of state secretary of health
just 12 days before the accident, agreed that the main health
effects appeared to be psychological ones that resulted in higher
alcohol and drug use by residents, as well as increased anxiety.
   MacLeod, however, also conducted research that concluded an
abnormally large number of babies were born with thyroid problems
after the accident.
   But MacLeod, who is now professor of public health and clinical
professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, said he
believes data will not be able to show whether radiation caused
increased incidents of cancer or other conditions because of a
multitude of other factors that could contribute to such diseases.
   More than 2,000 damage suits have been filed against General
Public Utilities or the plant's builders. A $25 million agreement
was reached in one class action suit filed shortly after the
accident, including $5 million to underwrite health studies.
   In 1985, insurance companies representing the utility agreed to a
$1 million payment for a Down's syndrome child born nine months
after the accident and $855,000 for a child who suffered cerebral
palsy. The agreements specified that the decision to settle was
merely economic and that the children did not suffer ``any provable
injuries'' as a result of radiation from the accident.

   Operators of the Three Mile Island power
plant in Pennsylvania avoided a nuclear disaster, but the accident
was a financial catastrophe for its owner, General Public Utilities
Corp.
   Yet a decade later, a plaque hangs in the company's lobby,
recognizing it as the 1988 Electric Utility of the Year by the trade
publication Electric Light &amp; Power.
   ``It's been an amazing turnaround,'' said Mark Luftig, a utility
analyst at the investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc.
   General Public Utilities lost $172 million on revenue of $1.49
billion the year of the accident. After paying a dividend of $1.20 a
share for 1979, the company halted dividends for the next eight
years, costing stockholders an estimated $800 million. Its stock
price plunged from $18 a share to a low of $3.37{.
   The company initially had to spend $24 million a month to buy
replacement power from other utilities. It also abandoned a power
plant in the early stages of construction after spending a third of
the expected $1.2 billion cost.
   But the utility, which provides electricity to 4.2 million people
in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, cut costs with a leaner operating
structure, and it finally won permission to restart an undamaged
nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in 1985.
   The company also was able to work out a cost-sharing plan for the
$1 billion cleanup of the damaged reactor in which it is paying
about a tenth of the cost. Insurance, its customers, federal and
state governments and the nuclear industry pay the rest.
   By last year, General Public Utilities had boosted its after-tax
profit to $283.8 million on $2.83 billion in revenue and its stock
price topped $38 a share.
   Issues still facing the company are the more than 2,100 personal
injury suits pending from the accident and the need to start
preparing for the cost of decommissioning the Three Mile Island
complex.

   On these isolated hillsides overlooking
Loch Carron, the dramatic quiet is interrupted by crofter Angus
MacRae calling out to his herding collies in their own private
language and by the excited bleating of sheep expecting to be fed.
   Here in Scotland's western highlands, far from the rest of the
world, a unique and ancient way of life called crofting, small
tenant farming, endures despite threats from many sides _ new taxes,
competition from agribusiness, and the encroachment of vacationers.
   Time is almost meaningless on this late winter day. What matters
is place.
   The exterior of this life is stunning _ cold and rugged, with
sunshine slashing diagonally through clouds in a wide sky. It
compels thoughts of God.
   MacRae stands with his back to subtly colored, peat-covered
Strome Hill. Spread before him is the metal-colored loch. His croft
is 70 miles from Inverness, the nearest city. About half the journey
is down single-track road. It's not raining, for a change.Anne, was born
in 1967. She now
attends university in Edinburgh. The three-bedroom house was built
in 1968. MacRae owns it, but not the land it stands on.
   ``We worked very hard, very long hours in the first years of our
marriage. Every pound we had spare we invested in our sheep.''
   He earned some 7 pounds ($12) a week when he started out in the
forests, hauling the timber with a horse. Lumberjacks now make about
100 pounds ($170). The income from the croft generally matched
MacRae's pay over the years.
   The crofter has 35 acres of land plus some of his township's
``common,'' and owns more than 400 Cheviot sheep. He sells their
lambs in Dingwall in September to other farmers.
   The working day starts at 8 a.m. The sheep must be herded and
fed, herded and dipped for delousing, herded and sheared. There are
jobs to do around the place, like mending fences. There are
crofters' meetings to attend.
   It has been a life without television, restaurants, traffic.
   In November, a leg injury forced MacRae to retire early from the
Forestry Commission.
   ``Now, I am a full-time crofter.''
   He pauses. Something is weighing on that poetic mind of his.
   It's not the new property tax that will raise the cost of
crofting; not the influx of English buying crofters' homes for
vacation cottages; not the rising competition from large-scale
sheep-raising in the South. These are all worries, but not the big
one.
   MacRae went to the library in town recently. He saw five people
there. He knew none of them. That's what's really bothering him.
   ``People coming from outside, they may not be as willing to pass
time with a passing stranger,'' he said. ``The whole way of life
could readily disappear.''

<TEXT>
   With nasty allegations flying and millions of
dollars on the line, actress Valerie Harper and the Lorimar studio
wanted their legal battle last year resolved as quickly as possible.
   But in Los Angeles, where the courts are as congested as the
freeways, it would take five years before a civil trial could begin
to decide whether Miss Harper was wrongly fired or wrongly quit the
``Valerie's Family'' TV series.
   The lawyers took a shortcut: for $50,000, they got their own
judge, bailiff, clerk and court reporter for a trial held in a
leased public courtroom before a jury selected from the public rolls.
   Within a year, the jury awarded Miss Harper $1.85 million in
damages and a cut in Lorimar's future profits that could be worth
$15 million.
   In contrast, the Los Angeles Superior Court jury that last month
awarded Marc Christian $21.75 million did so nearly four years after
Christian filed a lawsuit against former lover Rock Hudson alleging
that the movie star concealed the fact he had AIDS. The huge award
is certain to be appealed.
   With civil court systems seriously backlogged across the country,
thousands of litigants are finding out that they can afford to rent
their own judge.
   Retired jurists are returning to the bench for fees from $150 to
$250 an hour. Companies arranging rent-a-judge cases are reporting
record business. And litigants and lawyers say the speedy, private
proceedings are the best thing to come along in the American legal
system since the Bill of Rights.
   But the proliferation of such cases has many in legal circles
yelling ``objection.'' Critics say private adjudication often
discriminates against the poor, raises profound constitutional
questions and may be luring fine judges off the bench for an early,
lucrative retirement.
   ``I'm worried that we're getting a two-tiered system of justice:
one for the group of people who can afford to hire a judge and one
for the group of people who cannot,'' said American Bar Association
President Robert Raven.
   Attorneys for the poor and minorities want the legal
establishment to take a hard look at private adjudication and
implement what they call long-overdue reforms in the public system.
   ``No one who is powerful enough in the public system is going to
want to change it if there are other options. We're getting a deluxe
justice system for the rich and a deteriorating form for the poor,''
said Robert Gnaizda of Public Advocates, which provides legal
service for the poor and minorities.
   An estimated 800,000 civil lawsuits will be filed in the United
States this year, 100,000 of them in Los Angeles County where 60,000
cases are backlogged and the wait for trial routinely stretches
three to five years. The average wait nationwide is 18 months.
   This legal gridlock creates an expensive waiting game that
generally ends as lawyers' fees mount and nerves crack. More than 95
percent of civil cases are settled out of court, many within hours
before the scheduled start of a trial and after years of waiting.
   Rent-a-judge firms offer an attractive alternative. The wait for
a judge is about a month, many disputes are settled in a matter of
hours, and satisfaction is practically guaranteed. Fewer than 10
percent of decisions are appealed.
   ``We're getting busier and busier every month,'' said John
Trotter, retired presiding justice of the California Court of
Appeals and now vice president of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Services in Santa Ana.
   Judicial Arbitration, with 80 retired judges, hears more than 600
cases a month. Its competitor, industry leader Judicate, of
Philadelphia, predicts it will hear 10,000 cases this year, up from
4,000 last year.
   Such cases move smoothly because many trial rules are discarded
and both sides have agreed on the judge and on whether the judge
will act as a mediator or issue a decision. If the judge makes a
ruling, the lawyers can file an appeal in the public court system,
getting a big jump on everybody else.
   ``We cut right to the problem,'' said Trotter. ``We don't have
the formalities, the requirements, the pretrial rigamarole of the
public system. We're highly effective.''
   These were the benefits attorneys in the Harper-Lorimar dispute
had in mind when they hired retired Superior Court Judge William
Hogoboom.
   ``Things went smoothly. We selected a very competent judge, were
able to set a time schedule that we could stick to and rely on and
set up whatever procedures were convenient,'' said Miss Harper's
attorney, Barry Langberg.
   Lorimar wanted the dispute settled quickly out of fear it
wouldn't be allowed to use the name ``Valerie'' in the title while
the suit was pending. Miss Harper feared that allegations from
Lorimar that she was a temperamental star would keep her from
working elsewhere.
   ``She wanted a quick trial and we wanted a quick trial. It worked
out perfectly,'' said Lorimar attorney Donald Engel.
   Miss Harper's battle with Lorimar has become one of the best
known rent-a-judge cases, second perhaps only to the daily disputes
aired nationally on ``The People's Court,'' essentially a televised
form of private adjudication.
   But the Harper-Lorimar trial was unique in that it had a jury and
all the judicial trimmings. Most rent-a-judge cases cover matters
like insurance claims or bickering between companies over trade
secrets heard before a lone judge.
   Supporters of private adjudication say these disputes fall within
the 95 percent of cases that would probably have been settled out of
court anyway
   ``We're really not in competition with the courts,'' said William
MacQueen, vice president of Judicate. ``What we're doing is in fact
an alternative to a settlement negotiated by the parties. We are
able to provide what people intended in the first place.''
   Another benefit of the rent-a-judge system comes to litigants
seeking to keep their trial proceedings secret. Unlike public trials
in this country, the news media can be barred from rent-a-judge
courtrooms if both parties agree.
   Raven and other skeptics concede there may be a place for the
rent-a-judge concept, that many disputes don't have to wallow in the
courts awaiting a trial that may not be necessary in the first
place. They also want this kind of short-cut available to everyone,
not just those who can afford it, and not at the expense of the
public court system.
   The ultimate solution is to make the public system better and
eliminate much of the demand for rent-a-judges, Raven said. ``It's
the attorneys who should be taking the lead on this. They should be
shouting like hell.''

   ``Big'' (CBS-Fox Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated PG. Release
date March 23.)
   
   ``Big'' was just that at the box office, and the reason can be
summed up in two little words: Tom Hanks.
   For the same reason, it's well worth savoring this sweet if
slightly dopey comedy all over again now that it's available on home
video.
   As Josh Baskin, the 12-year-old boy who wishes he were big and
magically gets his wish, Hanks has a field day. He's remarkably
endearing and believable as an innocent prepubescent adolescent
suddenly coping with an adult body and an adult world.
   Watch his pricelessly goofy facial expressions while responding
to the seductive advances of Elizabeth Perkins. Watch how he uses
his body as he cavorts through a toy store, or plays his first
handball game in a schoolyard against a corporate rival. It's the
work of a superior clown.
   The screenplay by Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg isn't always up to
Hanks' inspired level, nor is Penny Marshall's direction, but the
star and a fine supporting cast carry one past the slow spots.
   Perkins does a good job with the rather silly and thankless role
of the corporate moll who has slept her way up the ladder but
sincerely falls for Hanks' literally boyish charm. Robert Loggia is,
as usual, splendid as the toy company czar who thinks he sees genius
in Hanks' enthusiasm for toys. Jared Rushton is winning as Josh's
best friend, Billy, and Mercedes Ruehl, as Josh's mother, shows some
of the same manic intensity she later brought to the part of the
jealous Mafia wife in ``Married to the Mob.''

   ``Midnight Run'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   ``It Happened One Night'' launched one of Hollywood's
institutions: the road movie. But there are road movies and there
are road movies. ``Two for the Road,'' with Audrey Hepburn and
Albert Finney was a delicious treat, while ``Planes, Trains and
Automobiles'' was laborious.
   What makes ``Midnight Run'' with Charles Grodin and Robert DeNiro
so special is the wonderful chemistry between the two actors, a
tight, excellent script by George Gallo and Martin Brest's gritty
direction.
   The movie enjoyed a small following when it played movie houses,
but never quite got the recognition it deserved.
   DeNiro, always a treat to watch, is a bounty hunter for a slimey
little Los Angeles operation. His assignment is to bring in Grodin,
who has embezzled $15 million from the mob and given it to charity
and is wanted by the FBI to be a witness against the crime boss he
double-crossed.
   Only problem: government agents are hot on his trail; so's the
mob; so's a rival bounty hunter who would sell his grandmother to
Bedouin mercenaries in order to get the goods.
   They go by plane, car, freight train, bus. You name it.
   Grodin is great with his blank face and devious ways. DeNiro is
lovable but tough. Dennis Farina (TV's ``Crime Story'') is the mob
boss and John Ashton, the bumbling cop of ``Beverly Hills Cop'' is
terrific as the other bounty hunter. Yaphet Kotto is deadpan funny
as the FBI agent who just hates bad news.
   Watch this one and make lots of pop corn because it's long _ but
it's worth it.

   ``Just Coolin''' (Atlantic) _ LeVert
   
   LeVert describes Side 1 of ``Just Coolin''' as a ``conceptual
funk suite,'' and the term is unintentionally apt. The five songs
will send most listeners into a conceptual funk that will have them
second-guessing their record-buying habits.
   In an attempt to attract a younger audience, LeVert has made
music for the curbside, with a backbeat guaranteed to drown out all
conversation and even honking cars. The problem is, it sounds like
the same backbeat on all five songs.
   Monotonous is not a strong enough word. The music lacks the humor
or grit of the best rap, and the street dialogue between cuts is
lame.
   Side 2 sees LeVert revert to the ballads that helped make their
first two albums big sellers. The tunes are in the Marvin Gaye
tradition _ the late singer is even mentioned in ``Let's Get
Romantic.'' But again, there's no variety in the tempos, and the
songs aren't good enough to justify the sleep-inducing pace. The
slow side is better than Side 1, but so is Tiffany.
   The best strategy for LeVert at this point would be to find some
stronger material, put out another album quickly and announce they
were just foolin' about ``Just Coolin.''' Refunds would be nice too.

   ``I Wanna Have Some Fun'' (Jive) _ Samantha Fox
   
   On the cover of this, her third album, we find Miss Fox pretty
much clothed, which must mean the former British pinup queen is
getting serious about This Music Thing. What she isn't getting is
much better.
   Oh, all right, most of this is harmless enough, I guess. She has
a serviceable, if unspectacular, voice and she has an army of
producers behind her, creating syntho-pop dance music, the likes of
which Donna Summer did an awful lot better 10 years ago.
   But there's one track in this morass that sinks below the others:
a blasphemous synthed-up ruination of the Dusty Springfield classic,
``I Only Want to Be With You.'' Whoever is responsible should be
forced to listen to the original _ or to Southside Johnny's soulful
remake _ repeatedly, while doing some prison time somewhere. Gaaaaak.

   ``Hold An Old Friend's Hand'' (MCA) _ Tiffany
   
   Teen-age pop phenom Tiffany is older now, all of 17, as she
follows up her immensely successful but shallow debut album recorded
when she was just 14.
   People will probably like ``Hold An Old Friend's Hand'' just as
much, but just what is it about this adolescent girl that inspires
such adoration?
   The 11 tracks here are the stuff of teen-age girl talk _ yearning
for boys, trying to be noticed by them, feeling rejected when one
stops calling and always keeping in mind that a girl doesn't need a
boy's attentions to validate her.
   All this has been done before, in a much more stylish manner,
than the accumulation of techno-pop brights and syrupy balladeering
engineered by Tiffany and her producer-mentor, George Tobin.
   But the hooks, as on ``All This Time'' and ``Radio Romance,'' are
mindlessly catchy, and Tiffany has a serviceable voice that often
recalls Stevie Nicks, especially in the lower registers.
   Some songs, such as ``I'll Be the Girl,'' dimly echo the girl
groups of the early 1960s, even to the point of having spoken verses.
   Perhaps it is the simple teen-age romance lyrics Tiffany sings
and the California wholesomeness she exudes that draws fans to her
like moths. She is the antithesis of the rebellious youth whose
image is projected by many rock acts; instead, she's everyone's
perfect daughter.
   Tiffany may be simply trying to reflect her age _ the 1980s, a
return to conformism and a distaste for experimentation of any kind.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Sally Kirkland Has Retained Her Vivacity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year ago, Sally Kirkland won an Academy
Award nomination as best actress and became the year's Cinderella
story, even if the coach and horses arrived a few decades late.
   The actress made her film debut in 1964, then got sidetracked
into off-Broadway plays and underground movies, many of which
displayed ample views of the admirable Kirkland frame. She later
played minor roles in films from ``The Sting'' to ``The Incredible
Shrinking Woman.''
   A few years ago, she campaigned for a low-budget drama, ``Anna,''
adding pounds and aging herself to fit the role of a faded Czech
film actress adrift in New York. She won the role and the
nomination, and no one was more tickled than she with such
recognition.
   Now, four films later, she retains her native vivacity.
   ``I got to turn down 10 to 15 scripts right away, because they
all came at once,'' the 44-year-old actress said. ``I chose the
parts I did because frankly, they gave me chances to make real
contributions; some of the other scripts may have been big-studio
deals, but they were smaller parts.
   ``A lot of people said, `Don't work, wait until you get the next
honest script.' I didn't want to be overly idealistic about that. I
wasn't sure when the `next honest script,' whatever that is, would
come. I wanted to keep working, and so I have been working nonstop.''
   The starring roles are in ``Melanie Rose,'' ``Paint It Black''
and ``Cold Feet.'' She also played a cameo role in ``Revenge,'' with
Kevin Costner and Anthony Quinn.
   ``Cold Feet,'' which will be released in April, is a modern
Western filmed in Montana and Arizona with Kirkland, Keith
Carradine, Tom Waits and Rip Torn. Playing with such an eccentric
group, she said, ``was very much like being a Marx sister.''
   She chose ``Cold Feet'' because ``I was dying to do light comedy
after such a tragic story as `Anna.'
   ``I also got to look very pretty, which I wasn't able to do in
`Anna.' I practically signed my life on the line, saying they could
do a `Raging Bull' number on me. Otherwise I wouldn't get the
part.'' The reference is to the critically acclaimed film about
boxer Jake LaMotta for which Robert DeNiro added 60 pounds.
   ``Revenge'' also took her to a rugged location in Durango, Mexico.
   She was impressed with Kevin Costner: ``He's so human, he's so
real. I pointed out a few things in the script that could be
reworked. Right away he went to Tony (Scott, the director) and said,
`Could Sally and I improvise for you?' Tony was wonderful in the
sense that he let us try new things.''
   Sally Kirkland's ambition came early. Growing up in New York City
the daughter of a fashion editor, she became acquainted with the
rich and famous. An early mentor was legendary producer David O.
Selznick, who predicted she would become a star. But he also
cautioned that she would be a late bloomer.
   The frustration of waiting caused a collapse in 1964.
   ``I think I had a breakdown,'' she recalled. ``I had so many
wide-eyed dreams, and one after another, things started going wrong.
   ``But when I came back, I had learned to meditate, I meditate a
couple of hours now. I do an incredible amount of exercise, Hatha
yoga and dance. I dance like a nut.
   ``I like to think that I have the body of a 20-year-old and the
energy of a 15-year-old. So the minute anything happens in the
business like rejection, I go run a mile, swim a mile, do three
hours back-to-back of hatha yoga, something very physical. Or, I
create a psychodrama session with a couple of actors and scream it
out. I don't sit on it.''
   Kirkland said the Oscar nomination was ``like a dream.''
   ``I was so high. I was like a little 12-year-old, so excited that
I don't think my feet were on the ground. my feet are back on the
ground now, and I'm still kind of amazed.
   ``I ran into a bunch of young actors yesterday, and they told me
how their acting teachers used me as an example in class. That
amazed me. I can remember when I used to look to Kim Stanley,
Geraldine Page and a lot of wonderful Broadway actresses. I thought,
`Oh God, some day I hope I can act as well as them.'''
   She admits that losing the Oscar to Cher was a bummer, since she
had been dreaming of a dark-horse victory. But, characteristically,
the depression didn't last long.
   ``I tell young actors: Make sure you do something else besides
acting. For me, it was painting and teaching. I think that if you do
acting and nothing else, when you're out of work you tend to turn
everything in against yourself and reject yourself,'' she said.
   ``If you have anything else you enjoy doing, particularly of the
arts _ writing, directing, producing, painting, music _ do it.
Because unless you can have fun with the game of the business, the
business is tough. It's tough no matter how you look at it,
particularly for women, although that's changing.

<HEAD>The Artists: The Anarchist King of the Avant-Garde</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Composer John Cage was recently reading
his computer-generated lecture at Harvard University when a young
woman wearing a leather jacket and a saucy smile strode onto the
stage and drank the glass of water that had been placed at the
speaker's side.
   Cage ignored her.
   Some in the audience of about 400 people decided it was part of
the act. It wasn't. Later, the mysterious interloper, Tami Lum, a
student at Simon's Rock College who made the 2{-hour trip from Great
Barrington for this moment, said she was thirsty and didn't think
Cage would mind.
   The audacious John Cage has that effect on people.
   At 76 years old, Cage ranks among the most controversial
composers of the 20th century and the anarchist king of the
avant-garde. This school year, Harvard University is honoring him
with the post of Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry. His
syllabus consists of a series of six lectures and six corresponding
seminars.
   The Norton chair honors contributors to poetry, broadly defined,
and since 1926 has provided its occupants with the salary and rank
of full professor for one academic year. Cage's predecessors in the
Norton pantheon include Leonard Bernstein, Igor Stravinsky, Frank
Stella, Lionel Trilling and Thornton Wilder.
   Harvard isn't alone in celebrating Cage. There will be other Cage
concerts around Boston, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston
Musica Viva have commissioned works by Cage to be performed this
year.
   Last year he was elected to the 50-member American Academy of
Arts and Sciences.
   Such are the crowning honors of a long career spent rattling
people out of the ruts of convention.
   Best known for his experiments with random or chance music, the
multifaceted Los Angeles-born artist and only child of an inventor
was introduced to music at age 8 when his aunt began teaching him
the piano.
   By 18 he was composing music and went on to study with another
musical revolutionary, Arnold Schoenberg. In 1949 he won the first
of many such accolades when the National Academy of Arts and Letters
honored him with an award for extending the boundaries of music.
   A theatrical event he organized in 1952, during which various
artists simultaneously performed independently, is considered the
model for the unstructured happenings of the 1960s. Cage has
produced works in Europe and Japan, written for films and is the
author of 12 books. He also has published collections of his
etchings and drawings. A series of 52 Cage watercolors is scheduled
for an exhibition next year in Washington.
   ``In what he does there is no ranking. He's the one,'' said Pia
Gilbert a composer who teaches aesthetics at The Julliard School in
New York.
   ``He really has been the pioneer, and has been consistent with
what he has pursued, with an amazing youthful approach, always
discovering, always continuing.''
   While she prefers more control in her own compositions, Gilbert
has been touched by the artist she has known for three decades. ``He
has influenced everyone who has been around him,'' she said. ``He
has influenced me in freeing my thinking. ... What he does is
liberate people.''
   At the start of one of his recent Norton lectures at Harvard,
Cage explained his lecture and himself with a four-page exposition.
The document had a run-on title of 16 words not separated by spaces
and starting with ``Method'' and ending with ``Performance.'' In the
written explanation, he said his purpose in life, discovered nearly
40 years ago, was ``the exploration of nonintention.''
   Furthermore, he added, ``I did not know immediately what I was
doing, nor, after all these years, have I found much out.''
   The raw clay of the lectures are 487 quotations from such
assorted sources as British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein,
naturalist and writer Henry David Thoreau, the writer James Joyce,
The Wall Street Journal and The Christian Science Monitor.
   He concludes, elliptically, ``All six lectures have been planned
in detail but I don't know what they'll be. I'll find that out by
writing them.''
   Sitting through one hour and 40 minutes of the excercise required
a certain devotion.
   The slender professor, dressed in blue workshirt, dungarees and
black leather running shoes, sat immobile as he intoned his piece.
For 71 pages he leaned into a microphone across a long, low table
and out of his mouth, in a reedy, soothing voice poured a string of
words and phrases at random.
   Cage has been up to this sort of thing for a long time.
   In 1951, in ``Imaginary Landscape,'' Cage wrote a piece for 12
radios and 24 musicians. During the work, each radio is tuned to a
different station, making the outcome unpredictable and each
performance unique.
   ``You have to just let it wash over you,'' Liz Lee advised as she
was leaving after one hour. The 20-year-old biology major came over
from nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology to hear and
experience Cage. ``It's kind of interesting. The point I get out of
it is all words have their own connotations.''
   Less enthralled was her companion, Ray Parker, 24, a jazz
musician in this academic enclave across the Charles River from
Boston. ``I see this as more of an experiment. I'm not really a big
fan of this kind of stuff. Art without form is nothing.''
   Back, inside the auditorium, Cage was still intoning:
   ``The State Department said its anti-Pakistan policy would have
peace in sharing in Burma ...''
   ``Mistakenly a camera''
   Around the room in the darkening light of sunset some faces
intently watched Cage. Heads bobbed in agreement. Others stretched
out in helpless sleep that testified to the lecture's soporific
effects.
   Cage enunciated every word and placed emphasis on certain lines.
   ``My composing not to supply old laws ...''
   The lecture ended with tumultuous applause and a shy, happy grin
from Cage, who crept away out back.
   Gertrude Freedman was ecstatic. The 78-year-old anti-nuclear
activist considered the lecture right up her political alley: ``He
mentioned every single trouble spot and the nonsensical things our
government is doing all over the world. He purposely didn't make
sense.''
   ``It breaks down my usual way of interpreting the world,'' said
Peter Warren, a jazz musician.
   Cage's unconventional lecture, he said, ``opens you up to a lot
of possibilities. This is what I'm trying to do with my music. What
he's trying to convey is there's an underlying meaning underneath
the random processes.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: A Song Machine Extraordinaire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lamont Dozier wrote his first song when he was 11
years old, taking encouragement from a Detroit schoolteacher.
   He handed in a poem at school and the teacher put it on the
board. ``Usually the teacher would change the poem every month,'' he
recalled. ``My poem stayed on the board six months. That stimulated
me a lot to continue my writing. That lady did a lot for me. Later,
I managed to plunk out some melody on the piano to put with it.''
   Now 47, Dozier's supervising his 9-year-old son, Beau, in a Los
Angeles recording studio: ``He's a good little singer and a good
little songwriter.'' Dozier and singer-songwriter-drummer-actor Phil
Collins won a Grammy award and a Golden Globe for ``Two Hearts,'' a
song they composed for the movie ``Buster.''
   ``I was a nervous wreck on stage,'' Dozier said. ``I had blocked
it out of my mind. I hadn't entertained any ideas of winning it. My
heart just went boom boom. It was like I was going to pass out or
something.
   ``I was never nominated for anything. I've had gold and platinum
records over the years but no awards. The Golden Globe was the
first.''
   For 12 years, Dozier was part of a songwriting team known as
Holland-Dozier-Holland, which rose to fame at Motown Records. Dozier
and the Holland brothers, Eddie and Brian, were responsible for
``How Sweet It Is,'' ``You Can't Hurry Love'' and ``Stop in the Name
of Love,'' among others. Their biggest selling song was ``You Keep
Me Hanging On,'' a hit for the Supremes, Vanilla Fudge and Kim Wilde.
   But Dozier isn't bitter that he wasn't nominated for awards
before: ``Without sounding goody-goody or something, I'm a
songwriter. Just to hear my songs on the radio is reward enough _ as
corny as it may sound.
   ``I'm thrilled about all of this. The main thing is making the
product good. If it's not good, I don't want an award for it. First
and most important is the public and what they think of what I do.
That's who I'm writing it for.''
   Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown in 1968 and ended their
partnership in 1972 because Dozier wanted to pursue a singing
career. ``I'll take another serious stab at it this year. Toward the
end of the year, hopefully I'll have an album out. I have interest
from two or three labels.''
   He's also writing a musical, ``Angels,'' and hopes to launch it
on Broadway. ``I'm the creator of the book and about 14 pieces of
music for it. I've had meetings with Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really
Useful Theater Company. Warner Bros. has signed me to a major
publishing deal because of it.''
   Dozier has been approached to write an autobiography titled ``The
Man in the Middle,'' because of the Holland-Dozier-Holland billing,
but he turned that down. ``There are some pages I want to fill in
first. I'm just starting.''
   Collins is the biggest star with whom Dozier has collaborated. He
recounted their meeting: ``I went backstage at one of his shows
here, you know how you do. I didn't know if he'd know what I did; I
was a little bit reluctant to take up his time.
   ``When I went in, an Atlantic Records publicity guy said, `I have
Lamont Dozier here.' He swung around and literally came and grabbed
and hugged me. It just blew me away. Come to find out, he collects
Motown memorabilia and I was one of his favorite writers. He wanted
my autograph and grabbed a guy to take a picture. He was totally
uncool.
   ``Shortly afterwards he called me. Did I have material for an
Eric Clapton album, `August,' he was producing? I sent him one
thing. He called again. Did I have another one? I dropped off a tape
at the studio. I was driving in my driveway and my wife, Barbara,
said, `Phil's on the line.' I heard the music in the background.
They'd already started recording it before I got home.''
   He was able to instantly submit a song because he writes four or
five hours a day. ``I've written over 700 songs and have some 400 or
500 unpublished and unrecorded. I make demos in my home.''
   Simply Red's latest album has a few Dozier songs on it. Boy
George's debut solo album has four. Dozier is now working with Steve
Perry on his new solo LP, talking with Lionel Richie about his
upcoming album and is writing eight songs with Collins.
   A year after the Clapton project, Dozier says, Collins was in
California. ``He dropped by the house. He wanted to talk about a
film, `Buster,' he had decided to do. He said he didn't want to have
anything to do with the music. He wanted to make a serious attempt
at acting.
   ``I came up with three things. I put the tracks down to give him
a feeling of what I was going for. I had titles; I hummed the
melodies. All of a sudden he wanted to get involved. He decided to
write the lyrics; he wanted Buster's point of view.''
   He also wrote ``Loco in Acapulco'' for ``Buster.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: A Doctorow State of Mind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   E.L. Doctorow may be New York's ``State Writer''
but the author is thinking about spending some time away.
   Doctorow has been living for 20 years in the vintage 1906 New
Rochelle house that inspired the best-seller and film ``Ragtime.''
But with his three children all grown he and his wife, Helen, think
a change of scenery might be in order.
   ``New York does mean a lot to me but we've been talking about
living out West or in Europe,'' said Doctorow, who was recently
awarded the New York Writers Institute Edith Wharton Citation of
Merit.
   Wherever the writer may settle, his novels will be remembered for
their evocative look at New York in the first half of the 20th
century. Open up one of Doctorow's books and be prepared: Harry
Houdini may come to visit; Emma Goldman might offer advice on love;
and Admiral Peary may invite readers along on a trip to the North
Pole.
   Look up and see the mighty Hindenburg zeppelin float by. Grab a
piece of paper and enter a contest for ``The Typical American Boy.''
Hop on the subway and discover the Town of Tomorrow at the World's
Fair. Sneak on a train and discover America.
   But be careful, bad things are everywhere: ruthless business
tycoons; pale-faced thugs; anti-Semitic punks; and legendary
gangsters such as Dutch Schultz, who loomed large in the Bronx of
the 1930s, a world of sweet potato vendors, junk hustlers and
``capable boys'' like Billy Bathgate, the narrator and adventurer of
Doctorow's latest novel, ``Billy Bathgate.''
   ``I think Billy is a rhapsodist,'' the author said in an
interview. ``He has enormous zest and the ability to be thrilled.
Billy really takes the world in. He embraces it all. No matter how
ugly, hideous or bizarre.''
   Doctorow, a native of the Bronx himself, returns in ``Billy
Bathgate'' to his childhood setting, the backdrop for earlier works
including ``Loon Lake'' and ``World's Fair.'' Billy Bathgate, the
author's ``alter ego,'' lives with his unstable and lonely mother
and dreams of meeting Schultz, who makes a cameo appearance in
``World's Fair.''
   One day Schultz's Packard pulls up in front of a local warehouse
and Billy has his chance. He impresses the gangster with his
juggling act, a ``Galilean maneuver'' that involves two rubber
balls, a navel orange, an egg and a black stone. The performance is
greeted with applause and a crisp $10 bill from a laughing Schultz.
   The resourceful Bathgate eases himself into the gangster's
entourage, winning the confidence of Abbadabba Berman, the
syndicate's financial wizard, and having a wild affair with
Schultz's mistress.
   ``The myth of Schultz is what I deal with,'' Doctorow said, ``but
he does really get involved with him in not a casual way. He's so
attracted to the idea of Schultz. The reigning gangster hero of his
neighborhood.''
   But the gangster has clearly seen better days. With prohibition
repealed, bootlegging is no longer profitable. An aggressive young
district attorney named Thomas E. Dewey is hot on his trail and
Schultz has become careless, committing murder at the slightest
provocation. He is eventually gunned down at a New Jersey hideout.
   Names and places often repeat themselves in Doctorow's novels
with the author citing ``a sort of repertory company of souls who
make their appearance in each book.'' But the writing covers a
variety of styles.
   ``Ragtime'' is breezy and crisp, with short, snappy sentences
moving events along. ``Lives of the Poets,'' six short stories and a
novella, is an experiment in minimalism as Doctorow departs from the
rich language of his other novels to give a stark version of life in
the 1980s.
   ``Loon Lake'' and ``Billy Bathgate'' use a stream-of-consciouness
narrative that speeds up, slows down and races ahead like bumper
cars at an amusement park. In ``Billy Bathgate,'' Doctorow writes of
Billy's initiation with guns:
   ``And then what happens, if you don't make it yours you are dead,
you have created the circumstance, but it has its own free-standing
rage, available to anyone, and this is what you take into yourself,
like an anger that they've done this to you, the people who are
staring at your gun, that it's their intolerable crime to be the
people you are waving this gun at.''
   Billy Bathgate adds to Doctorow's gallery of young heros from
``Loon Lake'' and ``World's Fair.'' The boys all behave very
differently but some common themes emerge.
   ``The stories are sentimental educations about young people
learning the ways of the world and their own emotions,'' Doctorow
said.
   Edgar Lawrence Doctorow was born in 1931, the son of David R.
Doctorow, who sold records and music equipment, and Rose Doctorow, a
pianist. While attending the Bronx High School of Science, he worked
on the literary magazine, ``Dynamo,'' and went to major in
philosophy at Kenyon College in Ohio.
   In the late '50s he read screenplays at Columbia Pictures and was
later hired as an editor with the New American Library. His first
two novels, the Western ``Welcome to Hard Times,'' and ``Big as
Life,'' a science-fiction story, were written in his spare time, as
Doctorow often put in 20-hour work days.
   In 1969, he began writing full time, and two years later came out
with ``The Book of Daniel,'' a critically acclaimed story inspired
by the lives of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, members of the Communist
Party who were executed in 1953 for selling atomic secrets to the
Soviets.
   ``Ragtime,'' a critical and commercial success, came out in 1975.
It was a montage of life in New York at the turn of the century.
Doctorow received the National Book Critics Circle Award and an Arts
and Letters Award from the American Academy and National Institute
for Arts. In 1986, he received the National Book Award for ``World's
Fair.''
   ``I don't believe in literature as an elitist taste,'' Doctorow
said. ``My great ideal of this sort of thing is Dickens, who was
read avidly by people who read newspapers and monthly magazines.
That's my idea of the way society and writers should relate.''
   ``Billy Bathgate'' has given the author the will to leave his
beloved Bronx for good. ``It is history, that pig, biting into the
heart's secrets,'' Doctorow wrote in ``The Book of Daniel,''
lamenting the transformation of his native Bronx from peaceful
getaway to crowded borough.
   Doctorow sees his next book as ``something huge.''
   ``I see it as something that will be some way of saying
everything that has to be said. I have a compulsion to find a form
for so many disparate things. Books leave me rather exhausted and
completed.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Former PTL Host Reflects As `Fence Walker'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There were times when gospel music
veteran Gary McSpadden would show up on the set of the PTL Show only
to be bumped off the guest list because the religious program had
filled its hour.
   Then, when PTL host Jim Bakker left the program as the result of
a sex scandal, the show asked the once-spurned McSpadden was asked
to save the show by becoming the new host. He became ``the new Jim
Bakker,'' the most visible celebrity on the troubled show in Fort
Mill, S.C., for about six months in 1987.
   Known as ``the gentleman of gospel music,'' the 46-year-old
McSpadden still reflects these days about his experiences on the
show at a time when national attention was focused on religious
programs and fund-raising and the troubles of Jim and Tammy Bakker.
   ``I was a fence walker,'' he said. ``I had the privilege of just
opening my heart and interviewing people. The joy for me was
creating some stability in all that chaos.
   ``The difficult part for me was knowing not what to say. I was
concerned I might make a big gaffe and contribute to some of the
problems. That was the touchy part for me.''
   McSpadden, who joined the show as part of the rescue effort by
the Rev. Jerry Falwell, said he harbors no animosity toward Bakker.
   ``I pray for him. I hope they (he and his wife) find themselves
at a point where they can minister the gospel out of the hurts that
they have felt.
   ``I hope that out of all this there comes a sense that the church
is very much alive and well,'' he said. ``I see a vibrancy. Maybe we
had gotten a little slothful of the discipline of our personal
lives. The church is only as strong as you and me.''
   McSpadden, aligned with Falwell in trying to keep the show alive,
left the program when Falwell dropped his association with it. The
revamped program is now known as ``Heritage Today.''
   ``I watch it on the satellite dish,'' said McSpadden, a gospel
music singer, writer, producer and publisher who has been a member
of the Oak Ridge Quartet (later country music's Oak Ridge Boys), the
Statesmen, the Imperials and the Bill Gaither Trio.
   A former $95-a-week singer who spent part of his honeymoon riding
a bus to make a gospel appearance, McSpadden said his stint as host
was good, but he felt uncomfortable raising money.
   ``There seems to be a black hole in Christian TV where the money
goes,'' he said. ``I don't know what that is. Maybe the guys at CBS,
NBC and ABC know where the money goes. It is expensive to do TV and
money that comes in seems to disappear.
   ``I never felt like I had the desire to create the huge
conglomerate it takes to make Christian TV go on. It was interesting
to me that I could provide some stability.''
   McSpadden, who interrupted his singing career to help his father
in ministering a non-denominational church for 10 years in Fort
Worth, Texas, said he hopes the scandals involving TV evangelists
are over.
   ``I pray for Jimmy Swaggart, too. When this all began, I started
praying for them. My wife and I asked God to sort all this out. I
hate to see anything happen to the church. It has been my life,'' he
said.
   ``I'd like to put a period at the end of all these things that
have happened these past few years. And just say it's over, these
men have asked forgiveness, they are sorry, let's go on. That's what
ought to happen.''
   He said gospel music has suffered a sales slowdown in the past
few years but he doesn't know if church scandals have contributed to
it.
   ``I think there comes with that a certain amount of distrust,''
McSpadden said. ``Maybe rightly so. We can all look back and see the
Elmer Gantry movie. We can all probably see from our childhood where
some pastor has failed.
   ``For me, it's made me look at my own accountability.''

<HEAD>ERs Now Seeing Effects Of Changing Type Of Coke Addiction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's 8 o'clock on a holiday evening and about a
dozen people wait in the lobby of Boston City Hospital's emergency
room, some slumped in the vinyl-covered chairs, some pacing
fretfully.
   Behind the swinging doors, emergency chief Dr. Peter Moyer is
called to the puzzling case of a car accident victim who has only
slight injuries but slips so deeply into unconsciousness he can
barely be roused by two physicians.
   ``Have you taken any drugs?'' doctors ask. ``Cocaine, heroin,
marijuana?''
   It's a question that has become more and more commonplace in
emergency rooms already burdened by increased patient loads.
   ``There is an emergency in the emergency room right now in not
only New York and Boston but around the country and for a variety of
reasons,'' said Ken Raske, president of the Greater New York
Hospital Association.
   Drugs, and their side effects of AIDS, violence and psychiatric
disorders, play a role in the problems plaguing big-city emergency
rooms, Raske said.
   From 1986 to 1987, according to the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, cocaine-related cases in emergency rooms increased 122
percent in the District of Columbia; 86 percent in both Boston and
Atlanta; 80 percent in Detroit; 73 percent in Chicago; 53 percent in
Minneapolis; 50 percent in Texas, and 39 percent in New York City.
   Heroin-related cases also increased in many cities but not as
dramatically.
   ``The principal reason is the change in the typical cocaine user
and the changes that have occurred within the cocaine epidemic,''
said Dr. Mark Gold, director of research at Fair Oaks Hospital in
Summit, N.J.
   The typical cocaine user in 1983 was a college-educated man in
his 30s who earned more than $25,000 a year and snorted the drug,
Gold said. By 1987, only 16 percent were college-educated, most took
the drug by the more potent methods of sniffing vapors or injection,
and most were unemployed and under 30.
   In New York, from 1985 to 1987, hospital stays increased 15
percent for substance abuse patients, according to a study by the
United Hospital Fund and the Bigel Insitute for Health Policy at
Brandeis University.
   Counting the number of overdoses is only half the picture. There
are also accidents caused by clouded senses and violence associated
with soured drug deals, Gold said. ``Some of the coroners report
cocaine-related deaths and include a person who has cocaine in his
blood and a bullet in his head.''
   At Boston City, most of the cocaine abuse is intravenous, Moyer
said. The emergency department also treats a high percentage of
violent trauma, largely due to its inner-city location, about half
of it believed to be drug-related.
   About 40 percent of the intravenous drug users seen at Boston
City's ER have tested positive for the AIDS virus, Moyer said.
   Efforts to stem the rising tide of drug abuse comes at a time
when emergency rooms already face increased patient loads, partly
because of the reduced role of the traditional family doctor and
partly because there are more people who can't afford a private
doctor.
   ``It's really providing a major backlog in the emergency
department system,'' said Diane Howard, director of the American
Hospital Association's division of ambulatory care and health
promotion.
   Emergency departments are caught between a growing number of
patients and a shrinking number of hospital beds due to pressures to
lower hospital stays and decrease insurance costs, said Dr.
Charlotte Yeh, a member of the board of directors of the American
College of Emergency Physicians.
   ``We in the emergency department ... basically, we never say
`No.' We're caught in the position where we will always see patients
and even though we can do the initial care, the initial
stabilization, we don't always have a place where we can turn that
patient over to. There's a growing bulge in the system,'' said Yeh,
chief of the emergency department of Newton-Wellesley Hospital in
the Boston suburb of Newton.
   ``The bottom line is that emergency care is being squeezed,''
Raske said. ``The real loser here is the patient.''

<HEAD>Researchers Looking At Hispanics To Find Diabetes Cause</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inside a small motor home, Joanne
Pierluissi raised her sleeve as nurse Mary Perez inserted a needle
into the vein above her forearm, drawing blood into a tube for a
diabetes test.
   As her daughters watched, Pierluissi, 24, said it was for them,
as much as for herself, that she agreed to be tested for the deadly
killer of Hispanics.
   Twelve million Americans have some form of diabetes, but it most
prevalent among minorities, especially Native Americans, blacks and
Hispanics. Hispanics are three times as likely to develop diabetes
as the general population, and 40 percent of the 700,000 victims in
Texas are Mexican-American.
   More than 150,000 Americans die from diabetes each year; another
150,000 deaths are diabetes-related, according to the American
Diabetes Association.
   No one really knows what sparks it, but researchers believe
Hispanics could hold the key. San Antonio, the nation's ninth
largest city, with a population that is 50 percent Hispanic, is
becoming the base for diabetes studies.
   San Antonio's Hispanic makeup led Dr. Ralph DeFronzo to abandon
his prestigious position as a Yale University diabetes researcher
and persuade his four-member team to relocate to the University of
Texas Health Science Center.
   Epidemiologist Dr. Michael Stern has devoted 10 years to studying
Hispanic diabetes and led the grassroots study of the most common
form, which develops mostly in obese adults over 40 who may have a
family history of the disease.
   Stern said family studies of diabetic patients are brining him
closer to finding the gene that triggers the disease, and to a
screening test.
   Researchers believe that poor Hispanics' diets of cheap,
processed foods, lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention _
either due to poverty or a cultural bias against doctors _ increases
their risk of acquiring diabetes.
   Educating elementary-school-age children about healthy diets
would help reduce the number of diabetes cases, DeFronzo said. ``If
you have a 65-year-old mother who weighs 220 pounds and you tell her
to go out and jog five miles Monday, Wednesday and Friday, she is
going to laugh at you.''

<HEAD>Researcher Developing Machinery To Braid Ceramic Fibers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aly El-Shiekh envisions astronauts on a
three-year trip to Mars ``knitting'' themselves a space station
using ceramic fibers that can be braided into panels, beams, boxes
and practically any other shape.
   ``We believe if they can take the ceramic fibers they need and
the machinery we're developing they would be able to literally make
the space stations they will need as they go,'' said El-Shiekh, a
mechanical engineer at working in North Carolina State University's
textiles school.
   El-Shiekh and his students are developing machinery to braid long
strands of ceramic fibers. Such fibers, bonded with epoxy, also will
form heat shields and many of the parts in the vessel that carries
people to Mars. The parts will withstand speeds of 50,000 mph and
temperatures of at least 4,000 degrees.
   While much of his work relates to the Mars Mission Research
Center here, El-Shiekh sees a big future for composite materials
like ceramic fibers.
   ``The day may very well come when you are driving around with car
engine parts of ceramic fiber,'' he said, adding that the
vibration-damping properties of the materials also would make them
good for torsion bars in cars.
   ``We also are working on the idea of putting this braided fabric
in concrete as reinforcing material instead of metal rods,'' he
said. ``It is stronger than steel, does not rust and would not wear
away _ the road would not deteriorate.''
   The fibers, including Kevlar now used to make bulletproof vests,
also could be used to make some body parts, and El-Shiekh is working
with Duke University researchers on ceramic ``stents,'' collapsible
braces for arteries.
   ``The possibilities are limitless.'' said El-Shiekh, who can
produce shapes ranging from hollow cubes to panels that have
openings for wiring and conduits already braided into them. ``The
big problem is cost and that's why we're working on this automated
machinery.''

<HEAD>Instrucciones de Condon Estan Demasiado Difficiles Para Comprender</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Condom instructions written in Spanish are too
complex to be understood by many Hispanics in the United States, a
researcher says.
   ``The use of condoms has assumed a prominent role in the national
strategy for prevention of AIDS, particularly in high-risk Hispanic
communities in the Northeast,'' said Robert O. Valdez, an assistant
professor of public health at the University of California, Los
Angeles.
   ``Yet a number of Hispanics are not literate in English or
Spanish. The result is a public health dilemma because many Hispanic
people are unable to read information such as condom instructions,''
he said.
   Only 13 of 25 condom brands purchased in Los Angeles included
instructions in Spanish, and all of those ``required reading ability
at the ninth- to 11th-grade level, which is well above the average
for most Hispanics in the United States,'' said Valdez said.
   The study by Valdez and other researchers was published recently
in the Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences. They cited a 1976
National Chicano Survey, which found that one-third of U.S.
Hispanics between age 15 and 45 said they were illiterate in English
and nearly 40 percent in Spanish.
   An earlier UCLA study found college-level reading ability is
required to understand most condom instructions written in English.

<HEAD>Beer Bottles Are Temporary Homes In Pygmy Octopus Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pygmy octopuses usually live in shells
abandoned by other sea creatures, but a ecologist Janet Voight was
able to study the small animals by luring them into empty beer
bottles.
   ``They decided the beer bottles are just as good as shells,''
said Janet Voight, a University of Arizona doctoral student.
   Unlike the giant Pacific octopus, which weighs about 50 pounds,
the Pacific pygmy octopus weighs between three-quarters of an ounce
and 1{ ounces. It lives throughout the Gulf of California,
particularly in shell-rich northern gulf areas of Cholla Bay near
Sonora, Mexico.
   Using brown beer bottles, Voight was able to trap and study 800
octopuses during a year. She removed each animal from its bottle,
anesthetized, weighed, and measured it, and checked its reproductive
status. The octopuses then were revived and released.
   The study helped Voight determine that pygmy octopuses have a
lifespan of 5{ to eight months, increasing their weight a
thousandfold, from .00141 ounces when hatched to adult weight
averaging 1.41 ounces.
   Since they grow so rapidly, researchers are investigating using
pygmy octopuses for food, Voight said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An operation that can treat tubal pregnancy on
an outpatient basis is less painful and costly, and just as safe and
effective as major abdominal surgery usually used for the problem, a
study concludes.
   About 2 percent of all pregnancies in the United States are tubal
pregnancies, in which a fertilized egg attaches to the wall of a
Fallopian tube instead of making its way to the uterus. The fetus
will die within three months of conception but must be removed
earlier to protect the mother's health, said Dr. Michael Vermesh, an
assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University
of Southern California.
   Both surgical methods involve removing the doomed fetus through
an incision in the Fallopian tube under general anesthesia.
   In the standard surgical method, laparotomy, access to the tube
is gained through a sizable incision in the abdomen. In a
laparoscopy, a tubular viewing device called a laparoscope is
inserted through a small incision in the navel, while the surgery is
performed with instruments inserted through another tube, inserted
through a second incision just below the public hair line.
   In the USC study, 60 patients were randomly assigned to received
either laparotomy or laparoscopy. Laparotomy patients required a
three-day hospital stay and spent four weeks disabled at home;
laparoscopy patients could go home the day of surgery or a day
later, and resumed normal activities in a few days.
   ``Pain and discomfort are greatly reduced with laparoscopy,'' and
savings from shorter hospital stays averaged $1,500 per patient,
Vermesh said.
   Length of surgery, degree of complications and preservation of
fertility were about the same for both groups.
   Laparoscopy is suitable only for pregnancies in which the
Fallopian tube hasn't ruptured and the fetus is small enough _ no
more than about 1{ inches across _ to be removed through the
surgical tube, Vermesh said.
   Only a handful of medical centers offer laparoscopy for tubal
pregnancy, although the laparoscope is widely used for diagnosing
such pregnancies and other pelvic abnormalities.

   Computer-aided design techniques will let
dentists take 3-D pictures of cavities and teeth and turn out
fillings in a matter of minutes without the cost of laboratory work,
researchers say.
   ``You can do a restoration in about 45 minutes to an hour,
compared with two appointments of considerably greater length using
current methods,'' said Dr. Harald Heymann, acting chairman of
operative dentistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. ``It certainly will enable a large part of the aesthetic
restoration being done today to be done right there chairside.''
   Instead of taking a physical mold of the tooth and giving a
patient a temporary filling while waiting for laboratory work, a
dentist will aim a small video camera at the cavity, snap a picture,
and wait.The digitized image is fed into a milling machine that
makes a filling in minutes.
   The process is expected to be approved by the Food and Drug
Administration within a year, Heymann said. ``This procedure offers
primarily an advantage in that it's aesthetic. And for the dentist,
there wouldn't be a lab bill involved. It would be very cost
effective.''
   The software and hardware are being constantly improved, he said.
``Five, 10 years from now we're probably going to look back on this
model the way we look at a Model T after looking at today's
modern-day Ford.''
   Heymann's experiments are focusing primarily on improving the fit
of the computer-generated ceramics and following up on people who
receive them.
   `It's not an experimental thing at all, in terms of dentistry,''
he said. ``You're interested in the performance of whatever
restoration or material you're replacing over time.''

   Eastern Airlines will ask a bankruptcy court
judge this week to approve the sale of its Northeast shuttle to New
York developer Donald Trump for $365 million, the first of an
expected series of asset sales by the troubled airline, an Eastern
attorney said.
   Representatives of the airline's pilots and mechanics unions said
Monday they would challenge the deal, which they expect to be
further slowed by weeks in bankruptcy court because of procedural
matters.
   Meanwhile, observers said the airline, after attracting throngs
of bargain-hunting fliers with a $12 Northeast shuttle fare over the
weekend, could be ready to expand its cut-rate strategy in an
attempt to keep cash coming into its strike-crippled operations.

   White House and Treasury Department officials
are reviewing a plan to protect fragile regional economies from the
quick sale of billions of dollars of real estate repossessed from
failed savings and loans.
   The plan was developed by former Deputy Treasury Secretary R.T.
McNamar, who presented it to Bush administration officials last week.
   According to an outline prepared by McNamar and obtained by The
Associated Press, it would create state or local trusts that would
issue bonds, backed partly by the federal government and partly by
state or local governments, and use the money to buy distressed
S&amp;Ls' real estate from the federal government.

   The United Mine Workers union's top
official is no longer willing to debate issues in a contract dispute
with the Pittston Co., a radio station reported Monday.
   UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran said Monday that union President
Richard Trumka decided to call off the debate when he learned that
Pittston Chairman Paul W. Douglas wouldn't attend, Bluefield radio
station WVVA reported.
   Corcoran and Trumka were in Charleston on business Monday, but
they declined to discuss the nature of their visit, the radio
station reported.
   The Greenwich, Conn., Fellowship of Clergy suggested the public
forum after a demonstration by coal miners outside Pittston
headquarters in Greenwich last month, and invited Douglas and Trumka
to participate.
   In separate letters Friday to the Rev. C. Edward Deyton, pastor
of Diamond Hill United Methodist Church in Greenwich and fellowship
chairman, Trumka accepted the offer and Douglas designated Gene
Matthis, chairman of the Pittston Coal Group in Lebanon, Va., as the
company's representative at the debate.
   Members of the United Mine Workers have been working for more
than a year without a contract in Virginia, Kentucky and West
Virginia.
   Pittson has about 1,700 workers in 20 mines and has laid off
about 4,000 miners in recent years.
   Miners threatened to strike Feb. 1, one year after agreeing to
work without a contract while negotiations continued, but accepted a
30- to 60-day cooling off period requested by the governors of the
three states.

<HEAD>Gerstner Departure Leaves American Express Without Its Key Strategist</HEAD>

   American Express Co. will lose a key strategist
and likely future chairman when Louis V. Gerstner Jr., its president
and head of its ``crown jewels'' credit-card and travel subsidiary,
takes charge of RJR Nabisco Inc. next month, analysts say.
   As chairman and chief executive officer of the Travel Related
Services Co. division, Gerstner was behind the expansion of American
Express' lucrative credit-card market share through new products
like the Platinum and Optima cards and oversaw the successful
``membership has its privileges'' promotion.
   His unit, which also is responsible for travelers checks and
travel service offices, consistently has been the most profitable
for American Express and in the entire financial-services industry.
   In last year's fourth quarter, the subsidiary's earnings rose 18
percent to a quarterly record $183.5 million.
   Gerstner's departure, announced Monday, after 11 years at
American Express will mean Chairman James D. Robinson III will have
to shoulder a larger portion of the daily activities now handled by
Gerstner, and leaves in doubt the choice of successor to Robinson,
analysts said.
   Robinson said he will assume the title of president of the parent
company, while Aldo Papone, president and chief operating officer of
Travel Related Services, will become chief executive officer of the
subsidiary.
   ``In all indication he (Gerstner) would have become chairman when
Mr. Robinson moved into retirement,'' said Perrin Long, analyst with
Lipper Analytical Services Corp.
   ``He (Gerstner) gets to run his own show now faster than he would
have had he stayed at American Express ... since there's only a five
or six year difference between he and Mr. Robinson.''
   Gerstner, 47, and Robinson, 53, had formed a highly effective
management team, analysts said, with Robinson establishing broad
corporate goals and Gerstner carrying them out and setting
market-share guidelines.
   Analysts said it was unlikely that Gerstner's departure would
have a major impact on American Express over the next few years,
since the company's long-range plans already are in place.
   But ``looking down the road, it will later depend on who emerges
in the next generation of leadership,'' said Adam L. Starr, an
analyst with First Manhattan Corp.
   Starr noted that Gerstner lately had been pushing for American
Express to focus more on the ``crown jewels'' travel related
services and less on high-risk businesses, including the Shearson
Lehman Hutton brokerage unit.
   Shearson's earnings have been hurt since the October 1987 stock
market crash. In the last two years American Express has cut its
stake in Shearson from 100 percent to 62 percent.
   Gerstner joined American Express in 1978 as president of the
American Express Card Division, and the next year was named
president of the Travel Related Services Group, responsible for
American Express cards, travelers checks and travel service offices.
   When Travel Related Services became a subsidiary in 1982,
Gerstner became its chairman and chief executive officer. He became
president of the parent company in 1985.
   During Gerstner's career at American Express, the company's card
membership rose from 8.6 million to 30.7 million as the card became
accepted in more retail stores worldwide.
   Gerstner's move came as somewhat of a surprise to analysts
because of his lack of experience in the food and tobacco
industries, RJR's core businesses.
   But those with whom he is closely associated said Gerstner
possessed the skills needed to run a company such as RJR, which
remains in a state of transition following its record $25 billion
acquisition by buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
earlier this year.
   ``A good manager can work in any industry,'' said Starr. ``He's
known as a real stickler for quality of service and products.''
   Gerstner will succeed F. Ross Johnson, who resigned Feb. 9 as
RJR's chief executive after leading an unsuccessful takeover bid for
the Atlanta-based company. He will assume his new post April 3.
   Analysts said Gerstner faces several challenges at RJR, including
deciding quickly what changes, if any, should be made due to the
buyout.
   RJR has indicated it will sell some lines of business to deal
with antitrust concerns raised by the federal government, but the
extent of any further restructuring _ such as other divestitures or
cutbacks _ is unknown.
   Gerstner also must develop strategies to address RJR's loss in
tobacco market share, said Marc Cohen, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein in New York.
   Among RJR Nabisco's operating companies are R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco, Nabisco Brands, Del Monte Foods and Planters LifeSavers.

   Speculation is rife that strike-torn Eastern
Airlines will introduce fares as low as $49 one way between New York
and Florida in time for Easter and students' spring break to lure
back passengers.
   But before you grab your sunglasses and beach towel, consider
this: Fares that cheap usually carry risks, and these could have
plenty.
   The experience over the weekend with Eastern's special $12
Northeast shuttle fare, which drew throngs of bargain-hunting fliers
and stranded hundreds in three airports, could be a good example.
   Even if the cheap seats to Florida are reserved, there may not be
enough pilots to fly the planes, and it might not be possible to
book through a travel agent, industry observers said Monday.
   Most Eastern pilots and flight attendants have honored the strike
by the airline's Machinists union, which entered its 11th day today.
Miami-based Eastern filed for federal bankruptcy court protection
from creditors Thursday, citing a cash crisis stemming from the
labor walkout.
   In an attempt to shore up its crumbling market share, analysts
believe Eastern may expand its cut-rate strategy from the shuttle to
its primary market, Florida, as travelers begin flocking south for
spring holidays. Industry speculation points to a $49 one-way ticket
between New York and Florida, which would be about half the
prevailing discount fare.
   But experts cautioned that any fare-cutting probably would be
short-lived and unlikely to be matched by Eastern's competitors,
whose Florida flights are nearly fully booked.
   Furthermore, some travel agents may refuse to sell the cheap
Eastern tickets, fearing the risk to passengers of flying on a
strike-bound carrier and a potential deluge of refund requests if
flights are cancelled.
   ``I can't afford to have clients come back to me with
complaints,'' said David Perelman, president of DMS Travel in
Manhattan. ``It's a great deal _ if you can get on a plane.''
   Suzanne Jensen, a spokeswoman for Uniglobe Travel (International)
Inc. in Vancouver, British Columbia, said some of the company's
franchised travel agents would sell the cut-rate tickets if
customers insisted _ but would not provide refunds.
   Eastern wouldn't say Monday whether it was considering launching
the fares and officials declined to comment on how the airline would
provide enough planes to meet demand if such a promotion was staged.
   Hundreds of passengers were stranded in New York, Washington and
Boston airports Sunday night when Eastern could not get enough
planes in the air to accommodate the throngs that bought $12 shuttle
tickets.
   ``We will approach each market on an individual basis; we have
not indicated what our fare plans are,'' said company spokesman
Robin Matell in Miami.
   Eastern would not need approval from the bankruptcy court to cut
fares, Matell said.

<HEAD>Eastern To Ask OK For Shuttle Sale To Trump; Unions Will Fight Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines pilots and mechanics unions say
they will mount a challenge in bankruptcy court to the proposed $365
million sale of the airline's Northeast shuttle to developer Donald
Trump.
   At attorney for strike-bound Eastern said the airline will ask
U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton Lifland this week to approve the
shuttle deal, the first of an expected series of asset sales by the
troubled airline.
   Farrell Kupersmith, a financial adviser to Eastern's 3,600
pilots, about 95 percent of whom are honoring an 11-day strike by
the Machinists union, said the pilots would oppose the shuttle sale
in court.
   Kupersmith, a partner with the consulting firm Touche Ross &amp; Co.,
also said a committee representing the interests of Eastern
creditors in the proceedings would want time to review the deal,
further delaying the sale.
   ``Every creditor knows that the only consistently profitable part
of Eastern is the shuttle,'' he said. ``You do not reorganize
companies by selling the best part.''
   A Machinists official also said Monday the union was working on
its own bankruptcy reorganization plan for Eastern, which could
include a buyout of the airline.
   The request to sell the shuttle would be the first step in what
is expected to be a long and bitter battle to reorganize Eastern,
which filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court last week.
   Eastern has 180 days to file a full reorganization plan, which
lawyers said would include the sale of some of Eastern's $4.5
billion in assets in addition to the shuttle. After the 180 days,
other parties in the case can file restructuring proposals.
   Under federal law, Eastern must persuade Lifland that the sale of
any asset is absolutely necessary to continue operations.
   The shuttle linking New York, Boston and Washington has been
operating since the Machinists went on strike March 4. The strike
sparked sympathy walkouts by pilots and flight attendants that
nearly shut the carrier down.
   The airline last weekend discounted shuttle fares to $12 and
reduced them to $49 during this week to lure passengers.
   Eastern lawyer Bruce Zirinsky said a request to close the shuttle
deal, announced in October, would be made by week's end. Repayment
of associated debt and a required pension fund payment would leave
Eastern with about $210 million in cash from the sale.
   ``If you don't sell it there's a significant risk that it will
deteriorate in value and Mr. Trump may walk away,'' Zirinsky said.
``We don't think it's prudent for Eastern and its creditors to bear
that risk.''
   U.S. Trustee Harold Jones, who will supervise administration of
Eastern's Chapter 11 case, said Monday that a meeting to appoint a
committee of about 20 creditors was set for March 22.
   The Machinists also will seek to block any Eastern-proposed
reorganization and keep the airline's assets from being sold, said
John Peterpaul, vice president of the International Association of
Machinists.
   Peterpaul said the union had a framework in place for a
reorganization that would include a joint buyout with outside
parties, but declined to elaborate. Trans World Airlines Chairman
Carl C. Icahn has been mentioned as a possible buyer.
   Union officials contend that Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's
parent Texas Air Corp., intends to strip Eastern's assets, attempt
to impose lower wages and break unions as part of a restructuring.
Lorenzo has pledged to keep the airline aloft by preserving its core
operations.
   The shape of Eastern's reorganization plan largely depends on
whether Lorenzo can replace pilots and increase the number of routes
being flown.
   Industry sources said Eastern is expected to begin advertising
this week for pilots because far fewer have returned to work than
the airline had hoped.
   Despite reports of a pilot shortage, sources said other airlines
were ``hiring like crazy'' and that the Air Line Pilots Association
planned to dissuade pilots from joining Eastern. The Trump sale also
could siphon some needed pilots from the airline.
   An industry official with knowledge of ALPA's plans said the
union this week is expected to approve loans, strike benefits and
payment of back salary to Eastern pilots. ALPA also plans to seek
commitments from other airline pilots unions not to fly planes on
routes purchased from Eastern unless the airline hires Eastern
pilots.

   The California branch of the nation's largest
solid waste disposal company agreed Monday to pay $1 million in
criminal fines to settle one of the largest criminal antitrust cases
in state history.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner said the company, Waste Management
of California Inc., entered a plea of no contest to one count of
conspiracy against trade and agreed to pay the maximum fine of $1
million. Two of its officials also entered no contest pleas to
settle the 2-year-old case.
   Waste Management of California is a branch of Waste Management
Inc. of Oak Brook, Ill.
   Waste Management, Western Waste Industries, Angelus-Hudson Inc.
and five of their employees were charged with conspiring to
eliminate competition and control prices in California's
multimillion-dollar commercial trash hauling industry.
   The prosecution has resulted in $2.2 million in fines so far.
   Prosecutors said the companies agreed not to take away each
other's customers and used below-cost sales ``blitzes'' to lure away
customers from businesses that refused to go along with the
agreement to divide up the state's trash hauling industry.
   Codefendant Western Waste pleaded no contest Feb. 3 and agreed to
pay a $900,000 fine as well as a $100,000 fine for an unrelated
toxic waste violation. Western Waste sales manager Ishkan ``Ara''
Grodian, 44, earlier agreed to a 45-day sentence in return for a
no-contest plea.
   Municipal Court Judge Richard A. Paez accepted pleas Monday from
Waste Management officials Wiley A. Scott Jr., 33, and Clifford R.
Chamblee, 65. Scott faces a possible maximum sentence of 60 days in
jail and Chamblee faces a possible maximum of 250 hours of community
service under the plea agreement.
   Another defendant, John Marderosian, 56, pleaded no contest and
faces a possible maximum of 60 days in jail. Marderosian's former
employer, System Disposal Service Inc., a Los Angeles subsidiary of
a Canadian firm, paid $236,500 in civil penalties and costs in 1987
to settle its liability in the case.
   Angelus-Hudson, the smallest trash hauling firm charged, pleaded
no contest Feb. 27 and agreed to pay a fine of $75,000.

   Channel One, an advertiser-supported TV news
service for schools, produced commercial-free live coverage of the
space shuttle launch, but one critic says the service still doesn't
belong in the classroom.
   Peggy Charren, head of the Massachusetts-based advocacy group
Action for Children's Television, said she expected the architects
of Channel One would be on ``their best behavior'' during the
current five-week test of the service.
   ``Trojan horses have some benefits. That's why people let them

   If the project moves beyond the test stage and is installed in
schools across the country, Mrs. Charren said she would not be
surprised to see an expansion of the time allowed for commercials.
   During the test in six schools, paid ads are limited to no more
than two minutes during Channel One's 12-minute daily news show.
   ``The problem isn't the two minutes of ads. The problem is we are
selling children to adverstisers. They think they are going to get
enough kids buying enough products to make the investment
worthwhile,'' she said.
   The special coverage of the shuttle Discovery's launch Monday was
billed by Channel One's producers, Whittle Communications LP of
Knoxville, Tenn., as a chance to demonstrate the vitality and
versatility of the news service that it hopes to make available to
8,000 schools next year.
   The 15-minute program included live shots of the blastoff and
commentary from ex-astronaut Don Lind and the two young news anchors
who appear on the regular Channel One show.
   It was left to each of the six test schools to use the program as
they saw fit, broadcasting it live in selected classrooms or taping
it for later use.
   At Mumford High School in Detroit, Principal Robin Oden said he
let teachers decide whether the show would be appropriate. He said
about three-fourths of the teachers showed it live.
   ``It was very, very exciting,'' Oden said. ``These are the kinds
of things that we can do with this system.''
   Stan Jasinskas, principal at Eisenhower Middle School in Kansas
City, Kan., said he had planned to record the show for later use,
but gave teachers the option of running it live after the launch was
delayed about two hours.
   Jasinskas said commercial-free specials ``certainly can't hurt''
Whittle's campaign to win support for the Channel One project.
   Channel One is in the second week of 25-show test at the six
schools. Whittle Communications gave each school $50,000 in video
hardware and a satellite dish. The news program, produced in Los
Angeles, is sent by satellite each morning to the test schools,
where it is recorded automatically for replay during school hours.
   The daily news show has included pitches for Levi's jeans,
Snickers candy bars, Wrigley's chewing gum and Head &amp; Shoulders
shampoo.
   Groups such as the National Parent-Teachers Association and the
National Association of Secondary School Principals have opposed the
idea of including paid ads in programs that are shown in school.
   But Whittle argues that the ads are a reasonable price for
schools to pay for the hardware and programming that none of them
have been able to afford otherwise. He also says the schools are
free to use the television equipment for other school purposes.
   Mumford's Oden, for instance, said teachers at his school plan to
make a videotape of tips on how to prepare for a required aptitude
test. He said the tape probably will be shown during the two-week
spring break hiatus that Channel One is allowing starting next week.
   Whittle also has agreed with a group of Western public broadcast
stations to make the Channel One distribution system available to
carry selected public service programs that schools could tape for
later use.

   The U.S.-Canada free trade agreement is going
so well that the countries will likely accelerate tariff reductions,
top trade officials say.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and Canadian Trade Minister
John Crosbie said they planned to begin reviewing requests to speed
up work toward eventual removal of tariffs on certain products.
   Mrs. Hills said that there was ``tremendous interest'' on the
part of U.S. firms to lower tariff barriers early. The historic free
trade agreement, which took effect Jan. 1, calls for the gradual
phase-out of all tariff barriers and most non-tariff barriers
between the two countries over the next 10 years.
   While the trade pact spelled out the cuts to be made each year in
tariffs on particular products, it provided for an acceleration if
both countries agreed.
   Crosbie predicted that faster tariff reductions could take effect
starting next Jan. 1 if negotiations are successful.
   Mrs. Hills said that her office already had received 200 requests
for accelerated tariff reductions on 2,000 items.
   Peter Murphy, the senior American negotiator on the free trade
agreement, said steel, textiles, chemicals, ``anything you can think
of,'' could be included.
   Mrs. Hills and Crosbie spoke to reporters Monday after the first
meeting of the U.S.-Canada Trade Commission. They are the only
members of the commission, which was created to resolve disputes
arising out of implementation of the accord.
   She termed the first session ``very, very productive,'' referring
in particular to the progress made in setting up a review procedure
for reductions in tariffs.
   About 70 percent of the $155 billion in trade between the United
States and Canada is already duty-free. The new agreement, which won
approval in Congress and the Canadian Parliament last year, is
expected to reduce the cost of doing business in both countries,
helping to spur productivity.
   Mrs. Hills and Crosbie discussed some areas of disagreement
between the two nations including disputes over trade in autos,
lumber, fish and wine.
   Crosbie predicted a complaint by American lumber companies that
Canada was unfairly blocking shipments of U.S. plywood into Canada
would likely be the first issue referred to a settlement board.
   Meanwhile, at a congressional hearing Monday, experts on trade
clashed over the question of whether the United States should have
more free trade accords like the one with Canada. Supporters said
America should explore similar agreements with Mexico and countries
in the Far East.
   ``Not only do free trade agreements provide tangible benefits,
they also demonstrate to a skeptical world ... the benefits provided
by increased trade liberalization,'' said Doral S. Cooper, the chief
negotiator of a U.S.-Israel free trade agreement.
   Mrs. Cooper, a former assistant U.S. trade representative who now
heads an international business consulting firm, said several
countries on the rim of the Pacific Ocean are interested in such
agreements.
   But C. Fred Bergsten, director of the private Institute for
International Economics, told the Senate Finance subcommittee on
international trade that he opposed separate free trade pacts.
   ``The United States cannot possibly achieve the liberalization of
foreign trade barriers it needs from even the most extensive
possible series of bilateral and regional deals,'' he said.

   Share prices were higher in moderately active
trading at midday Tuesday, defying expectations of a quiet, drifting
market ahead of the introduction of the British government's fiscal
1990 budget in the afternoon.
   Wall Street's strong finish Monday led the London market higher
in the opening hours of trading. But as trading approached midday,
the market came off its best levels and volume slackened.
   ``It's all gone dead,'' one trader said. ``We won't see anything
now until after the budget speech.''
   At 3:30 p.m. in London, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
was expected to announce a fiscally tight budget for the year
beginning April 1. Such a budget would help deflate the market's
fears of continued high British inflation and that ``great hope''
buoyed early trading, said one trader.
   At about noon, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 15.3 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,118.3, though down from the
high of 2,122.7 reached at about 10:15 a.m. (1015 GMT).
   Volume came to 373.9 million shares at midday compared with 270.3
million shares at the same time Monday.
   The 24.11-point rise Monday in the Dow Jones industrial average
to 2,306.25 boosted an already confident London market, dealers said.
   ``We closed Monday when the Dow was already up 16 to 17 points
and it was good to see it finished better than that,'' one London
trader said.

<HEAD>Boeing Seeks Dismissal of Suit over Electromagnatic Pulse Radiation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. is seeking dismissal of a suit
filed by an employee who said he contracted potentially fatal
leukemia from exposure to electromagnetic pulse radiation on the job
without his knowledge.
   In a motion filed late last week in King County Superior Court,
Boeing attorneys led by V.L. Woolston said the case brought by
Robert Strom, 49, of Kent, a 27-year employee of the aerospace
giant, was ruled out by the same law that established Washington
state's workers compensation system.
   Michael Withey, Strom's attorney, said Monday the case qualified
for an exception under the law.
   ``There are certain well-stated exceptions to the workers'
compensation system,'' he said. ``There's no question in our mind
that Boeing intended to subject Bob Strom to this radiation without
his knowledge.''
   On Friday, Strom's attorneys moved to expand the suit to a class
action covering about 350 employees of Boeing and other companies
who were exposed to the radiation, known as EMP.
   ``Given its broadest possible reading,'' the latest Boeing
document says, the suit claimed the company knowingly subjected
Strom ``to a dangerous form of radiation exposure, deliberately
departed from proper safety procedures and failed to warn him
regarding risks associated with radiation exposure.''
   ``Boeing flatly denies the truth of these scandalous
allegations,'' the document states.
   Withey and the Boeing attorneys have asked Judge Mary Wicks
Brucker to hear their motions April 10.
   Strom, an electronics technician, learned in June 1985 that he
had chronic myelogenous leukemia and filed for workers compensation
benefits the next year. He said he conducted EMP experiments in the
MX missile program.
   His claim was rejected by the state Department of Labor and
Industries, which held that the fatal disease was not the result of
exposure to the radiation. The Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals
upheld that finding twice.
   Last November an industrial insurance appeals judge ruled that
evidence failed to establish that EMP exposure caused the leukemia.
   Strom appealed that ruling to the King County Superior Court, an
action separate from the lawsuit, and Boeing attorneys argued that
the appeal is his proper legal course of action.

<HEAD>Japanese Firm Decision To Buy Shaklee Corp. Sends Stock Soaring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision by a Japanese pharmaceutical firm
to acquire Shaklee Corp. for $395 million sent the giant direct
sales company's stock soaring.
   Following announcement of the $28 per share, all-cash bid by
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Shaklee's stock jumped 9\ to close at
47] on the New York Stock Exchange Monday.
   The stock price set a 52-week high for Shaklee, a San
Francisco-based direct seller of vitamins, household and
personal-care products.
   ``I feel it's a very fair price for shareholders,'' said O. Lee
Tawes III, an analyst with New York-based Oppenheimer &amp; Co. He said
the combination of the bid and special dividend will work out to
about 24 times earnings.
   The bid by the Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturer foiled an
unsolicited offer from a Minneapolis group headed by corporate
raider Irwin Jacobs.
   On Monday, Jacobs said he will not make a new offer for Shaklee.
   Yamanouchi, which last month bought Shaklee's Japanese
subsidiary, will pay cash for Shaklee's estimated 14 million
outstanding shares and intends to retain current management.
   ``I am very pleased that we have joined with Yamanouchi in an
historical accomplishment _ a major acquisition accomplished through
the joint efforts of American management and a major Japanese
company providing substantial benefits to public shareholders,''
said Shaklee President David Chamberlain in a statement.
   Chamberlain, reached later by phone, said the Japanese firm
bought the company because they ``were very excited about the
management'' and liked the company's current direction.
   The $28 per share bid is in addition to a special dividend
recently announced that will provide another $20 per share to
Shaklee stockholders, payable next Monday.
   Yamanouchi, which had net income of $173 million and sales of
$1.42 billion last year, beat out a $40 per share, $528 million cash
offer by Jacobs' group on March 3.
   However, the Jacobs group, which included Minnesota Twins owner
Carl Pohlad, said its offer would be reduced to $20 per share if the
$20 special dividend was paid.
   Under the merger agreement, Shaklee agreed to pay $16 million to
Yamanouchi if Shaklee is purchased by another company.
   Jacobs, reached at his Minneapolis office, said his group had
purchased some two million shares of Shaklee stock at $25-26 per
share and stands to make up to $44 million in profit from the
Yamanouchi deal.
   ``We're disappointed we didn't get the company, but I'd be a fool
if I said I was disappointed financially,'' said Jacobs, a
49-year-old investor who had hoped to mesh Shaklee with Watkins Co.,
a direct seller of household products he bought 10 years ago.
   Jacobs insisted his intention was to buy Shaklee and that his
group was merely outspent by the Japanese company.
   ``We will not be competing on it,'' Jacobs said. ``They have a
chance to do very well. We wish them a lot of success.''
   The merger agreement also provides Yamanouchi the option to buy
15 percent of Shaklee's shares at the tender offer price under
certain circumstances.
   Shaklee had earnings last year of $27.2 million, or $2.05 per
share, on sales of $627 million. Almost half its earnings last year
and more than a quarter of its sales came from the Japanese unit it
sold to Yamanouchi for $350 million.
   Shaklee's board of directors unanimously approved the merger
agreement following a review and recommendation from a special
committee comprised of independent members of Shaklee's board.

<HEAD>New York Investment Group Takes 8.8 Percent Stake In CNW</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York investment group has bought an 8.8
percent stake in CNW Corp. and may attempt a takeover of the
railroad company.
   Japonica Partners, a limited partnership formed in 1988 by two
former executives of the New York investment firm Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co., told the Securities and Exchange Commission it wants to replace
current CNW directors with its own slate.
   Paul Kazarian, one of the partners, said Monday that Japonica is
``pursuing discussions with financial institutions'' aimed at
financing the takeover.
   CNW Chairman Robert Schmiege said the company will ``carefully
review'' the filing, but added that the Chicago-based railroad
company intends to remain independent.
   CNW is the holding company for the Chicago and North Western
Transportation Co., a leading freight hauler.
   Japonica told the SEC in a filing that it plans to wage a proxy
fight at CNW's annual meeting May 16 in an attempt to elect its own
slate of directors.
   It said that if it is ``successful in obtaining an active role in
the management and@or control of the company,'' it will consider
several possible actions, including taking CNW private,
restructuring the firm and selling certain assets.
   In a letter March 13 to Schmiege, Kazarian accused CNW of
refusing to ``sponsor adequate plans or programs to substantially
enhance stockholder value by closing the value gap between the
company's potential value and its prerumor stock price.''
   Schmiege saw it differently.
   ``Our board of directors and our management has made it very
clear that the interests of all of its constituencies are best
served by CNW remaining an independent company and pursuing its
recently adopted business plan,'' said Schmiege.
   Rumors of a possible takeover have driven CNW stock sharply
higher in recent weeks, gaining almost $8 a share since March 1.
   However, CNW stock fell 87 cents to $38.25 Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange after announcement of the filing.
   Anthony Hatch, an analyst with PaineWebber Group Inc. in New
York, said investors may have been disappointed that the takeover
attempt wasn't being mounted by someone with greater financial clout.
   In partnership with Kazarian, 33, is Michael G. Ledermann, 36, an
attorney with experience in railroad legal matters.
   Kazarian said he headed the team that advised Santa Fe Southern
Pacific on its restructuring but left Goldman before the effort was
completed.
   While at Goldman, Kazarian also worked on Conrail's public
offering and on the spinoff of the Illinois Central Railroad from
Whitman Corp.
   In 1988, CNW posted a 195 percent increase in net income, to $81
million, or $4.34 a share, on revenues of $995.4 million.

   The central bank Tuesday cut the
interest rate on three-month treasury bills, Belgium's key lending
rate, to 8.4 from 8.3 percent and the one and two-month rates by
0.05 point each, to 8 and 8.2 percent respectively.
   It was the first time since last December that Belgium has
reduced its short-term interest rates.
   The move reflected a recent stabilization in international
interest rates following a steady rise since the beginning of 1989,
analysts said.
   However, the key three-month rate is still almost one point above
its level of December 1988 when it stood at 7.5 percent.
   The bank did not comment on the rate cuts. It left the interest
rate on four-month certificates unchanged at 8.4 percent but raised
that of the six-month paper to 8.4 from 8 percent.

<HEAD>EEC Tentatively Okays TV Broadcast Standards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nearly 12 hours of negotiations,
Common Market countries on Tuesday tentatively adopted EEC-wide
television broadcast rules designed to stem the flood of U.S. shows
and encourage European productions.
   At a European Economic Community trade ministers meeting,
Belgium, Denmark and West Germany voted against the legislation but
could not block it under EEC voting rules.
   The EEC law stipulates an unspecified ``majority'' of televison
programs, excluding news and sports casts, must be of European
origin to be shown throughout the 12-nation Community.
   This applies to both EEC and non-EEC broadcasters. The EEC law
also sets out minimum standards of morality and regulates the
frequency and duration of commercial breaks.
   Jean Dondelinger, the EEC Commissioner for audio-visual affairs,
welcomed the accord. ``We now have, across the Community, the same
legislation on television broadcasting,'' he said.
   His draft law included a minimum 60 percent European content
clause.
   This was rejected in talks among the EEC states that revealed a
rift between northern and southern states as to how far the
Community must discriminate in favor of European content. The EEC's
southern nations favored stricter European-content rules in
television.
   Officials said the law is designed to limit the number of
relatively cheap American television productions from West European
television screens and to encourage more European programming.
   It is estimated that 70 percent of television programs shown in
Europe are of non-EEC origin, the overwhelming majority of them
American.
   Tuesday's agreement will be completed April 13, they said.
   The EEC law also aims to encourage local production of programs
in EEC nations with a weak production capacity or which have
language restraints. It also forces broadcasters to fix a minimum 10
percent of broadcast time for European programs by independent
producers.
   Belgium voted against the plan saying it lacked adequate
protection for its Dutch and French-speaking broadcast industries.
   Denmark's opposition arose from a belief the EEC Commission lacks
the ability to monitor compliance with the legislation.
   In voting against the legislation, West Germany argued the 11
West German states _ not the Bonn government _ are responsible for
broadcasting.
   Also, officials said, Bonn wanted the EEC legislation to consider
East bloc television productions as ``European'' which is not the
case under the EEC law.
   The EEC plan is in line with a draft broadcasting convention of
the 22-nation Council of Europe, a cultural and political
organization based in Strasbourg, France. The Council of Europe,
which is a separate body from the EEC, is to finalize its convention
later this week.

<HEAD>Farley Tender Offer For West Point-Pepperell Is Extended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST POINT, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farley Inc. has extended its $1.73 billion
tender offer for West Point-Pepperell Inc. by 10 days, to midnight
March 27, apparently to provide time to arrange financing for the
textile company acquisition.
   The $58-per-share offer had been scheduled to expire at midnight
Friday. The merger agreement also expires March 27.
   Farley, based in Chicago, did not give a reason for the
extension. The Atlanta Constitution today quoted an official close
to Farley as saying more time was needed to make arrangements to
complete the deal.
   ``It takes a bit of time,'' said the official, who was not
identified. ``He (Chairman William Farley) has to go out and raise
the money. It takes a few days to do that.''
   Farley is putting about $230 million of its own money into the
acquisition. Farley has said it will sell off some of Pepperell's
assets in an attempt to retire between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion
of the debt associated with the merger within two years.
   Farley won a four-h
anniversary of the death of Charles I. She is to be interred in the
Hapsburg vaults of Vienna's Capuchin Church.
   Zita had lived at Johannes-Stift the past three decades. Two
plainly furnished rooms were the home of the woman who once held
court at the Versailles-sized castle of Schoenbrunn in Vienna.
   Her husband ruled over a multilingual empire of 50 million people
stretching from what is now Poland to the Mediterranean. After the
Allied victory in World War I, he agreed to ``temporarily
relinquish'' his imperial rights. He never officially abdicated.
   Zita, a mother of eight and a Roman Catholic, wore mourning black
from the time Charles died in exile on the island of Madeira in 1922.
   Tragedy surrounded the ascent of her husband.
   He was crowned emperor of Austria and King of Hungary after the
death in 1916 of his uncle, Francis Joseph, who reigned 68 years.
   Francis Joseph's wife, Elisabeth, was fatally stabbed by an
Italian anarchist in Geneva in 1897. Their son, Crown Prince Rudolf,
killed himself in a suicide pact with his mistress in 1889. Their
nephew, Francis Ferdinand, the heir presumptive, was shot by a
Serbian assassin in 1914, triggering World War I.
   Charles I initiated moves in 1916 to negotiate a peace he hoped
would save the Austrian monarchy. Zita helped arrange secret
contacts with the Allies.
   The go-between was her brother, Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma,
then serving in the Belgian army, who was in touch with French
President Raymond Poincare. In turn, Poincare notified King George V
of Britain.
   The Austrian efforts were revealed in 1918, causing an uproar and
rocking the Austrian-German alliance. Zita became known as the ``spy
of the Bourbons.''
   The 1918 exodus from Schoenbrunn Castle was the beginning of a
long odyssey.
   Charles took exile in a Lake Geneva chateau at Prangins,
Switzerland. But after launching from there an abortive combeack
attempt, he was banished to Madeira, where he died a year later at
34.
   A widow at 29, Zita turned down invitations from royal relatives
and instead chose to bring up her children in modest environments,
first in a Spanish fishing village and then in the Belgian
countryside where she raised chicken and sheep.
   Hitler's Blitzkrieg sent the family fleeing to Canada and the
United States where they lived at Tuxedo Park, N.Y. After the war,
Zita toured American cities to promote humanitarian aid for Europe.
   In the early 1950s, she returned to Europe and settled at Zizers,
a few hours drive from the postwar home of her oldest son, Otto von
Hapsburg. She curtsied before him when Otto, at age 18, became the
new titular head of the Hapsburg dynasty.
   Although the Austrian border is only 18 miles from Zizers, she
did not visit the country for 63 years. An Austrian law, enacted
after the revolution in 1919, allowed entry only to those members of
the Hapsburg family who pledged allegiance to the Austrian republic.
   All but Zita signed the pledge. ``My mother felt that abdication
would have amounted to a betrayal of my father,'' Otto explained.
   In 1982, Austria relaxed the ban following a personal request by
Spain's King Juan Carlos, a relative of Zita. Thousands cheered when
Zita appeared at St. Stephen's Cathedral.

Co. is out to destroy it.
   In a lawsuit filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, ICG
accused Andersen of intimidating prospective ICG employees and
clients, and of using its dominant market position to prevent
competition in the consulting field, violating Illinois' antitrust
laws.
   ``... Andersen has waged a campaign of false statements, coercion
and unfair trade practices against ICG,'' said Gresham T. Brebach
Jr., chief executive officer of New York-based ICG, a consulting
firm formed last year by six ex-Andersen partners.
   ``ICG is entitled to transact business without being intimidated
or otherwise inhibited in its ability to compete,'' Brebach said.
   Andersen said the lawsuit was a desperate attempt by ICG to
survive in a competitive field.
   In addition to the $300 million damages claim, ICG's lawsuit
requests an injunction barring Andersen from further interfering
with ICG's recruitment and business development efforts.
   The legal battle between the two firms began last year, when six
former Arthur Andersen employees, including Brebach, left the agency
to start their own competing firm with the assistance of
London-based Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC.
   Andersen, the nation's largest accounting and consulting firm,
has sued Saatchi and ICG, accusing them of trying to force Andersen
to sell at least part of its consulting business.
   Andersen has since restructured its operations by elevating the
internal status of its consulting partners in an apparent attempt to
end defections of the sort that led to the creation of ICG.
   ICG's lawsuit claims Andersen threatened partners and employees
who were considering leaving the company for ICG, and offered others
extra pay and better jobs if they would stay.
   In a lawsuit filed in October in the New York Supreme Court,
Chicago-based Andersen accused Saatchi and ICG of raiding Andersen
personnel, interfering with Andersen clients and misappropriating
Andersen's confidential and proprietary technology and trade secrets.
   Last week, Andersen amended its lawsuit to include 14 additional
defendants, including Maurice Saatchi, chairman of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, the world's largest advertising holding company.
   The amended complaints allege that Maurice Saatchi and former
Andersen personnel now with ICG are participating in various
improper activities to injure Andersen's consulting practice.
   In a lawsuit filed in December, seven former employees of
Andersen, including the six at ICG, charged that Andersen owes them
income, retirement benefits and their capital contributions to
Andersen. The group is seeking a court-supervised accounting to
establish the exact amounts owed them.

<HEAD>Toronto Company Says It Wants To Block Imperial's Texaco-Canada Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small Toronto company says it wants to block the
multibillion-dollar takeover of Texaco Canada Inc. and make a bid
itself for Canada's fourth-largest oil company.
   The president of Barron Hunter Hargrave Strategic Resources Ltd.,
a penny-stock company that trades on the Alberta Stock Exchange,
made the statement Monday after the exchange forced the company to
clarify a news release issued last week.
   Texaco Inc., based in White Plains, N.Y., announced Jan. 20 that
it was selling its 78 percent stake in Texaco Canada to Imperial Oil
Ltd. of Canada for $3.24 billion. Imperial is 69 percent owned by
Exxon Corp., the largest U.S. oil company.
   While analysts dismissed the new 11th-hour bid, John Hargrave
said his firm has backers that will finance an offer for Texaco
Canada if the federal Competition Tribunal blocks the megamerger.
   Last week, the company issued a cryptic statement saying it had
``entered into an agreement'' with Texaco Inc. last September
``regarding the acquisition of Texaco Canada.''
   But the Alberta exchange ordered the company, which has small
mining and oil interests, to issue a clarification Monday.
   The new release made it clear the ``agreement'' with Texaco was
only a confidentiality agreement, which was signed by several
companies that wanted to review the U.S. oil giant's information on
its Canadian subsidiary.
   Hargrave also said he had ``confidential information'' that
Imperial was planning to sell gas stations to Petro-Canada.
   Imperial spokesman Dennis Baxter said Monday he hadn't heard of
the company's involvement, while a Texaco spokesman said several
companies had signed the confidentiality agreements.
   News of the company's involvement was apparently leaked prior to
last week's statement as the share price jumped to 7 cents from 4
cents in active trading.
   On Monday, the share price rose another penny to 8 cents on a
volume of 168,000 shares.
   But Hargrave said he is not simply trying to boost the stock
price.
   ``If we wanted a stock play, we could have done it for Christmas,
but we didn't,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   ``If the tribunal dissolved the deal, we are prepared to make a
bid.''
   Hargrave wouldn't reveal the names of his backers, saying only
that one was a ``big bank'' and the other a ``big brokerage.''
   Imperial closed the deal earlier this month, but it is awaiting
approval from the Bureau of Competition Policy, the Canadian agency
that investigates monopolies.
   The bureau has indicated that Imperial must sell some of its
assets before the deal can be approved.
   Hargrave said Imperial Oil was able to bid ``higher than market
price because it is getting a near monopoly in gasoline sales in
Ontario.''
   He said Barron Hunter Hargrave would intervene at the tribunal
hearing and seek the dissolution of the deal, adding that it was the
``height of arrogance'' for Imperial to close the transaction before
the tribunal ruled on it.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Dipped to $135 Billion Last Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
trade narrowed to $135.3 billion last year for the best showing
since 1985, despite a steep deterioration in the balance on
investment earnings, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the deficit in the current account,
also known as the balance of payments, shrank 12.1 percent from the
record imbalance of $153.96 billion set in 1987.
   The current account is the most important trade statistic because
it measures not only trade in merchandise but also transactions in
investments and other services.
   The big improvement last year came entirely from merchandise
trade, where the deficit shrank by 21.1 percent to $126.5 billion.
This reflected a 28 percent surge in American export sales, which
was enough to offset a 9 percent rise in merchandise imports.
   However, in an ominous sign for the future, the nation's surplus
in the investment category shrank by 76 percent last year to a
slight $4.78 billion, down from $19.76 billion in 1987.
   This decline reflected the fact that foreign holdings in the
United States have increased to such an extent that foreign
investment earnings now rival and, economists say, will soon surpass
American investment earnings overseas.
   As recently as 1981, the United States ran surpluses in its
current account because the nation's cushion in overseas investment
earnings was enough to offset perennial deficits the country ran in
merchandise trade.
   However, in this decade, Americans have handed over billions of
dollars to foreigners in exchange for imported goods. This
development has transformed the United States from the world's
largest creditor nation, a position now held by Japan, to the
world's largest debtor country.
   Simply put, that means that foreigners now own more in U.S.
investments than Americans hold in overseas investments.
   With today's report, U.S. net debt probably climbed above $500
billion at the end of 1988, up from from $368.2 billion at the end
of 1987. The exact accounting of the U.S. net debtor position will
not be released by the Commerce Department for several more months.
   While former President Reagan maintained that the big rise in
foreign investment was simply a sign that the United States offered
excellent opportunities, many private economists contend that
Americans' standard of living will be reduced as the country is
forced to transfer more assets abroad to service the debt to
foreigners.
   Today's report showed that the current account deficit for the
October-December quarter declined by 2.1 percent to $31.9 billion,
compared with a revised $32.6 billion deficit in the third quarter.
   The quarterly improvement came from a rebound in the services
category to a surplus of $4.5 billion, after two consecutive
quarterly deficits. Those deficits in services, which primarily
reflect investment earnings, were the first in that category in 30
years.
   But despite the rebound in the fourth quarter, economists say the
trend is clearly in the wrong direction and they predict 1989 will
likely be the year that the services category dips into deficit for
the foreseeable future.
   That will mean that for the country's overall balance of payments
to improve, the United States will have to start running surpluses
in merchandise trade, something it last managed to do only once in
the last 15 years.
   For the year as a whole, the $135.3 billion current account
deficit was the smallest since a $115.1 billion imbalance in 1985.
The current account last showed a surplus in 1981, when the country
took in $6.88 billion more from foreigners than it purchased from
them.
   While merchandise trade showed a dramatic improvement in 1988,
many economists believe that improvement has now stalled out.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc., said the
United States would not see any further improvement in its trade
performance this year, in part because the value of the dollar has
not fallen enough to spur further gains in U.S. export sales. A
weaker dollar makes U.S. goods more competitive on overseas markets.
   ``We will have a lot of volatility from month to month, but we
are not looking for any improvement for the year as a whole,'' Ms.
Latta said.
   The country's continuing need to finance its trade deficits with
foreign investment is one of the biggest economic problems facing
the new Bush administration.
   The dollar fell sharply immediately following Bush's election as
foreign investors feared that Bush's no-tax pledge and the larger
Democratic majorities in Congress insured further deadlock on
resolving the federal budget deficit, which must be financed in part
with foreign borrowing.
   Bush moved quickly to reassure jittery financial markets by
pledging at every opportunity that he viewed tackling the federal
budget deficit as his top economic priority.
   While the dollar did stabilize, the administration remains
concerned that foreign investors could grow disenchanted if they
believe the current budget negotiations between the administration
and Congress are likely to end in stalemate.

   Pilots from all the nation's air carriers are
considering ways to support fellow pilots in the strike against
Eastern Airlines, including refusal to fly Eastern planes or routes
sold by the airline.
   The Air Line Pilots Association board met all day Monday in a
closed-door session to plan strategy for the Eastern Machinists
union walkout, which is in its 11th day today.
   John Mazor, pilots spokesman, said 46 pilot union leaders from
various airlines discussed the level of strike benefits to be paid
3,600 pilots who have been honoring the Machinists walkout.
   The group also is setting up interest-free loans for paychecks
which members should have received from Eastern for their last week
of work before the strike, Mazor said. Eastern filed for protection
under bankruptcy laws last Thursday, which was payday, and the
unions have appealed to the bankruptcy judge to release their pay.
   The pilots discussed plans to refuse flying Eastern planes or
routes purchased by their airlines, unless enough Eastern pilots are
also hired to fly them, Mazor said. To cover all shifts, that could
include from six to 12 crew members for each plane, he said.
   Eastern is running only a small fraction of its more than 1,000
daily flights, and officials have said they plan to scale down the
airline, possibly selling off assets to other carriers.
   A $365 million sale of the airline's Northeast shuttle operations
to New York developer Donald Trump was pending before the strike. It
awaits approval of the Federal Aviation Administration, which must
determine whether Trump can operate the airline safely, and of the
bankruptcy court in New York.
   Mazor said Eastern has been able to slightly expand operations in
recent days because it finally has been able to deploy more of its
management pilots, not because of union defections. He said that
although a few union pilots have crossed the lines, more from the
other side have joined the walkout, resulting in a net loss of
pilots available to the airline.
   Mazor acknowledged that a directive last week for union pilots of
all the nation's airlines to follow the most time-consuming safe
flying procedures did not result in significant delays at airports.
   He said about 60 percent of pilots were following the procedures
and he expected many to continue. But Mazor said there were no plans
to either repeat or rescind the notice which had been intended as a
show of support for Eastern pilots.
   The Air Transport Association, representing the nation's major
airlines, had urged the pilots not to follow the directive which it
characterized as a ``slowdown order.''

   The stock market pulled back in mid-morning
trading today after a good opening, as institutional investors took
to the sidelines to await Wednesday's merchandise trade deficit
report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 0.89 point at
2,305.36 at 11 a.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was up 3.39 points
an hour earlier.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by around 7 to 6 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 606 issues down, 521 up and 594 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 51.83 million shares.
   Analysts said the bond market reacted favorably to a government
report released this morning showing retail sales declined 0.4
percent in February. The bond market's enthusiasm pulled stock
prices higher.
   The lower retail numbers indicated the Federal Reserve's efforts
to slow the economy by tightening credit and raising interest rates
are working.
   ``The retail sales figures leads one to believe that inflation is
not running away,'' said John Burnett, senior vice president,
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   But stock trading was light at the opening and slackened off even
more by mid-morning as institutional investors turned skittish ahead
of the economic statistics to be released later this week. The first
will be January's merchandise trade deficit report scheduled for
release on Wednesday. Other reports on housing starts and wholesale
prices will be released later in the week.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

   Masco Corp., moving to expand its home
furnishings business, will acquire Universal Furniture Ltd. in a
deal approaching $500 million, the companies say.
   Masco and the High Point, N.C.-based furniture manufacturer
announced Monday that both sides had agreed to the merger.
   Masco, which reported $2.4 billion in 1988 sales of furniture,
home furnishings and home improvement products, will give Universal
shareholders 0.95 of a Masco share for each Universal share held,
the companies said.
   Based on Monday's closing price of Masco's stock, the transaction
would have a total value of $484.5 million.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, Masco shares
closed at $25.50, off 25 cents. Universal closed at $22.75, up
$2.25, in national over-the-counter trading.
   The companies said the agreement had been approved by their
boards and they expected to complete the transaction in three to
four months, subject to approval by regulatory agencies and
Universal shareholders.
   Masco entered the U.S. furniture business three years ago when it
acquired Henredon and Drexel Heritage. Since then, the company has
bought other furniture and home accessory makers and the acquisition
of Universal is its largest home furnishings purchase to date.
   Universal, a leading manufacturer of popular priced furniture and
the largest supplier of dining room furniture in the United States,
has 12,500 employees and reported sales of $472 million in 1988.

   Soybean futures prices opened slightly higher, but
wheat and corn mostly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Most of the activity was in the wheat pit, where a round of
profit-taking followed several sessions of rising prices and
life-of-contract highs prompted by the unusually dry weather
recently in the Plains.
   But the profit-taking, coupled with the chance for rain this
weekend, put wheat under pressure at the opening bell. And traders
warned if it continued lower, a spillover effect may bring the beans
and corn down as well.
   ``Even though you've got a bullish (weather) forecast, the market
takes a break once in a while to recover profits,'' said one trader.
``That's what we might be looking at today.''
   At the opening, wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.34{ a bushel; corn was \ cent

   The Air Line Pilots Association said today its
members would refuse to fly Eastern Airlines planes or routes that
are sold to other airlines unless strike-supporting Eastern pilots
are hired with them.
   The association also announced a $9-million benefits package for
Eastern pilots honoring a machinists union walkout.
   Eastern is running only a small fraction of its more than 1,000
daily flights, and officials have said they plan to scale down the
airline, possibly selling off such assets as planes and routes to
other carriers.
   A $365 million sale of the airline's Northeast shuttle operations
to New York developer Donald Trump was pending before the strike. It
awaits approval of the Federal Aviation Administration, which must
determine whether Trump can operate the airline safely, and of the
bankruptcy court in New York.
   Eastern filed for protection under bankruptcy laws last Thursday,
which was payday, and the unions have appealed to the bankruptcy
judge to release their pay.
   Henry Duffy, pilots association president, said member pilots
from 47 airlines would be assessed an average of $300 a month to
support the Eastern pilots and the union would draw from its
$37-million strike fund as the money is collected.
   ``All 41,000 pilots will reach deep into their pockets to help
the Eastern pilots who are reaching deep within themselves to cope
with the personal and professional risks of their action,'' Duffy
said at a news conference as the strike entered its 11th day.
   He said the union's executive board also approved during a
day-long meeting Monday interest-free loans for Eastern crews,
including $2,000 for captains, $1,500 for first officers and $1,200
for second officers, to replace March 15 paychecks which the company
will not issue because it has filed for protection under bankrupty
laws.
   The pilots were also appealing to the bankruptcy court to appoint
a trustee other than Texas Air Corp. head Frank Lorenzo to oversee
Eastern Airlines business during bankruptcy proceedings.
   John Bavis, chairman of the striking Eastern pilot group, said
the union's monthly payments would amount to less than half of
airline pilots' regular salaries but would help them meet mortgage
payments and buy groceries.
   ``Despite management's claim, we haven't cracked, we haven't
given in,'' Bavis said. He said less than 2 percent of Eastern's
3,600 union pilots had crossed picket lines. He estimated that
management was operating with fewer than 200 pilots, many of whom he
said have already worked the maximum 100 hours a month allowed by
the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Bavis said Eastern pilots are continuing talks with management in
hopes of resolving their own contract.
   John Mazor, union spokesman, said the union has given financial
support to pilots in previous strikes but has never put together
such an extensive package of payments, loans and other action.
   Mazor said Eastern has been able to expand operations slightly in
recent days because it finally has been able to deploy more of its
management pilots, not because of union defections. He said that
although a few union pilots have crossed the lines, more from the
other side have joined the walkout, resulting in a net loss of

   The stock market gave back earlier gains and
moved mostly lower at midday as investors took to the sidelines to
await Wednesday's merchandise trade deficit report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 2.32 points at

shortly after the opening bell but slid 0.89 point lower an hour ago.

   Analysts said softer-than-expected retail sales figures for
February gave a lift to the bond market early in the day and stocks
followed. But the rally was short-lived and the stock market
reversed course as the dollar moved lower in response to the
surprisingly low retail sales numbers.
   The government reported retail sales declined 0.4 percent last
month.
   Volume, which was light at the opening, slackened off even more
by midday as institutional investors turned cautious ahead of
Wednesday's merchandise trade deficit numbers.
   ``Institutional investors are sitting on the sidelines to watch
for tomorrow's trade figures,'' said Philip Puccio, senior vice
president at Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
   Although many economists expect the U.S. trade deficit for
January to narrow from $10.23 billion in December, the market
remains skittish.
   ``They're waiting for a lot more statistics on the economy,''
said Emmanuel Geronimous, senior vice president of Shearson Lehman

   Profits of U.S banks soared to an all-time high
of $25.2 billion last year, even as more commercial banks failed
than in any year since the Depression, the government reported today.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., said bank profits for the three months ending Dec. 31 hit a
record $6.5 billion, $600 million higher than the previous record of
$5.9 billion set in the third quarter of 1988.
   In previewing the report in a speech on Monday, Seidman had said
profits were $6.7 billion in the fourth quarter and $25.3 billion
for all of 1988. However, that number did not include a single large
bank that reported losses of $205 million for the quarter and $125
million for the year.
   The $25.2 billion for all of 1988, up from $2.8 billion in 1987,
tops the previous high of $18.1 billion, set in 1985.
   The U.S. economy, as measured by the gross national product, last
year expanded at the fastest pace in four years and the business of
most of the nation's 13,114 commercial banks expanded along with it.
Also, Third World loan problems, which forced banks to take big
losses in 1987, improved somewhat.
   ``By far the most important factor has been the economy, which
has been strong and has been reflected in banking results. Inflation
is basically under control,'' Seidman said at a news conference
today.
   However, he noted that deposits grew only 4 percent in the year,
about half the rate needed to keep up with inflation and economic
growth, indicating banks were suffering competitively against mutual
funds and other alternative investments.
   Commercial banks as a whole were earning the profits while a
severe recession in oil-producing states pushed bank failures to a
post-Depression high of 221.
   Seidman predicted that bank failures would fall by about 20
percent this year. Thirty banks have failed so far in 1989, compared
with 44 during the same period last year.
   Seidman chided banks for passing on $13 billion of last year's
profits to stockholders and cautioned that the earnings figures were
inflated by ``many unusual, non-recurring events.''
   ``That amount (of dividends) represents 52 percent of the year's
earnings. A more conservative approach would have provided a greater
capital base to improve 1989 earnings,'' he said.
   He said the nation's largest banks in the fourth quarter began
recording interest income on loans to Brazil, which resumed paying
interest on its $110 billion debt.
   In addition, the $2.3 billion loss posted by First RepublicBank
Corp. of Dallas was excluded from the industry's year-end results
because it was closed by regulators and reopened under a new owner.
Those two factors alone pumped up 1988 earnings by more than $5
billion.
   The high rate of failures in 1988 caused the FDIC to register a
loss for the first time since it was established in 1934. The
insurance fund shrank from $18.3 billion at the end of 1987 to near
$14 billion at the end of 1988.
   President Bush is proposing to replenish the FDIC fund by
increasing banks' deposit insurance premium from 83 cents per $100
of deposits to $1.50.
   Seidman said the higher insurance rate, if adopted, will cut into
profits this year, but industry performance will be determined
largely by the state of inflation and the economy. Private
economists expect inflation to edge up this year and they predict
economic growth will slow in the second half.
   ``I think it's safe to say that commercial bank profits will look
good next to thrift profits (in 1989), but they will be nothing to
brag about,'' said Paul Getman, an analyst with The Wefa Group, a
consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   The nation's 2,950 savings and loans likely will show record
losses this year topping $10 billion. The Federal Home Loan Bank
Board reports later this month on that industry's performance for
1988.
   The bank board this afternoon is due to report on deposit
withdrawals in January. Bank board chairman M. Danny Wall, in
congressional testimony earlier this month, said a preliminary
estimate showed net withdrawals at a near-record $7 billion.
   He said most of that was caused by higher returns offered by
alternate investments such as money market funds, but private
analysts blamed some of the outflow on depositor worries triggered
by news accounts of S&amp;L problems.
   Getman said steadily rising interest rates will squeeze both S&amp;L
and bank earnings this year, but slower economic growth won't hurt
greatly until next year. Most bank loans have adjustable interest
rates and as rates rise, delinquencies increase, he said.
   Also, Getman said, the nation's biggest banks, under Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady's initiative announced last week, will come
under more pressure to write off Third World debt. In addition,
once-stellar large regional banks are having real estate problems in
New Jersey, Boston and Atlanta, he said.

   A federal judge today asked for clarification of
an unprecedented settlement prosecutors say will wrest the Teamsters
union from the Mafia.
   Under the settlement, which is subject to approval by U.S.
District Judte David N. Edelstein, the nation's biggest union will
institute the secret ballot, and three court-appointed watchdogs
will oversee the Teamsters for three years.
   However, Edelstein recessed a morning hearing until the
afternoon, citing ``apparent ambiguities on matters of serious
importance.'' The judge asked both sides to ``provide this court
with the clarification essential.''
   The accord was announced Monday hours before the start of a trial
on a racketeering lawsuit to oust the union's allegedly
mob-influenced executive board.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh detailed the terms of the
agreement in Washington, saying it will give the government ``the
tools to clean up this union and return control to rank and file
union members.''
   Rudolph W. Giuliani, who filed the lawsuit in June when he was
U.S. attorney, said the agreement ``achieved all the major
objectives that the government wanted.
   ``It should be considered a breakthrough,'' he said.
   Beginning in 1991, the union's highest leaders for the first time
in Teamsters' history will be elected directly by the members in
secret ballot votes.
   Currently, delegates to the national convention pick the
executive board members by roll-call vote.
   Also under the settlement, the judge will appoint three overseers
for three years, with the joint approval of both sides. One would
investigate and prosecute alleged union corruption, one would
administer disciplinary action and the third would oversee elections.
   ``All Teamsters international union officials will be directly
elected by the membership in secret ballot. That's never happened
before,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Mastro, the lead
prosecutor.
   In exchange, prosecutors dropped their bid to seize control of
the 1.6 million member union through a court-appointed trustee. The
settlement also allows all 11 Teamsters who remained as defendants,
including international President William J. McCarthy, plus three
other officials who settled last week to remain on the board.
   The pact between the current union leadership and the Justice
Department gives neither side complete control, although both sides
tried to put the best face on the compromise agreement.
   ``The members are assured there is a mechanism in place to remove
those persons alleged to be conducting improper activities,'' said
James T. Grady, Teamsters' general counsel. ``The goals of a clean
and democratic union are consistent with the goals of the current
leadership.''
   Thornburgh said the settlement ``culminates 30 years of efforts''
by the Justice Department ``to remove the influence of organized
crime within the Teamsters union.''
   Using federal racketeering laws, prosecutors sought a
court-appointed trustee or committee to run the Teamsters and impose
a series of reforms. It was the first time the government had tried
to seize control of an entire union.
   Thornburgh said the settlement contained ``roughly the same kind
of remedy that was sought'' in the lawsuit.
   But Grady noted that none of the union's ruling executive board
members would have to resign and there will be no all-powerful
trustee running the union on a day-to-day basis.
   The lawsuit claimed the Teamsters' leadership had been dominated
by organized crime, which ``deprived union members of their rights
through a pattern of racketeering'' and a ``campaign of fear'' that
included 20 murders, dozens of bombings, beatings, bribes, extortion
and theft.
   Most of the 26 reputed mobsters originally named defendants were
dismissed when they either agreed, or were ordered, to drop any
involvement with the Teamsters. Five, including convicted Colombo
crime family boss Carmine ``Junior'' Persico, have been severed from
the case and will be tried later.
   When he filed the lawsuit, Giuliani said the action was an
attempt to break the ``devil's pact'' the Teamsters' leadership had
made with the Mafia.
   The government's move was roundly criticized by congressmen and
labor leaders. The AFL-CIO, which allowed the Teamsters to rejoin in
1987 after a 30-year rift over corruption, called the lawsuit ```a
clear abuse of the government's prosecutorial power.''
   Prosecutors noted in court papers that four Teamsters presidents
since the 1950s have faced federal felony charges and three were
convicted: David Beck for embezzlement, James ``Jimmy'' Hoffa for
obstructing justice and mail fraud, and Roy Williams for trying to
bribe a U.S. senator.
   The fourth, Jackie Presser, the union's president at the time the
lawsuit was brought, died while under indictment on embezzlement
charges.

   Grocers nationwide stripped grapes and other
fresh fruits imported from Chile from store shelves today as
authorities tried to determine the source and extent of an apparent
cyanide poisoning attempt.
   Frank Young, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration,
urged Americans to be ``safe rather than sorry'' and discard all
fruit in their refrigerator unless they know for sure it isn't from
Chile.
   The FDA, in one of the largest actions of its kind, on Monday
warned consumers not to eat any fruit imported from Chile after
traces of the poison were found in seedless red grapes shipped from
the South American country to Philadelphia.
   The cyanide was confirmed in testing ordered after an anonymous
threat to poison Chilean fruit was telephoned to the U.S. Embassy in
the Chilean capital of Santiago.
   Young, speaking with reporters after a White House meeting, said
that washing fruit alone would not decontaminate it if the fruit has
been injected with the poison.
   ``At this time, you cannot tell in your refrigerator whether the
fruit is from Chile. If you want to be safe, rather than sorry,
discard anything that you can't tell is from Chile,'' he said.
   Young said he wanted to get the warning out to the American
people because ``I couldn't let it on my conscience.''
   ``We have to develop an entire strategy on this,'' he said.
``We'll be meeting with representatives of the Chilean fruit
growers, also the government of Chile, the FDA, FBI, and we'll get a
joint strategy. We hope to do that soon.''
   Earlier, Young made rounds of morning television news shows to
spread the warning.
   ``This may be an isolated incident, but we can hardly take that
chance,'' he said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   He said his agency acted because ``we felt compelled to honestly
warn the American people. We do not know at this time how widespread
the cyanide-tainting is, but we felt that it was better to be safe
than sorry.''
   ``The Chilean government and fruit packers have been incredibly
cooperative,'' Young said. ``We don't want to cause a public panic,
yet we only felt that it was fair that people should know.''
   The FDA urged that all fruit imported from Chile be removed from
U.S. markets and Chilean fruit not yet distributed be held while
tests continue.
   Supermarkets across the country began clearing their shelves of
the produce soon after the announcement Monday evening, said Karen
Brown, a spokeswoman for the Food Marketing Institute.
   Virtually all the fresh grapes sold in the United States at this
time of year come from Chile, FDA officials said, adding that grapes
make up about two-thirds of the Chilean fruit currently being
shipped to the United States.
   Other Chilean fruit being sold here at this time of year include
peaches, blueberries, blackberries, seedless watermelons,
cantaloupes, Juan Canary and honeydew melons, raspberries,
nectarines, quince, Granny Smith green apples, cactus pears, pears
and plums.
   The amount of cyanide found in the grapes was less than would be
needed to make a small child sick, but is more than would be found
naturally, the FDA said. Canadian officials, who followed the U.S.
lead and asked stores in Canada to remove all Chilean produce, said
a young child would have to eat at least 2,000 grapes to ingest a
lethal dose.
   News reports in Tokyo said Japan also will halt imports of fruit
from Chile because of a threat of cyanide contamination telephoned
to the Japanese embassy in Santiago last week.
   The American Produce Association, which represents 65 companies
importing Chilean fruits and vegetables, said it also recommended
that its members recall all Chilean fruit now in food stores and
warehouses.
   Neither FDA officials nor the Food Marketing Institute
spokeswoman knew the total amount of fruit that was being taken off
the shelves.
   However, Chile's fruit exports have boomed in recent years. The
nation's Central Bank says that in 1988 those exports reached $584.1
million _ more than 25 percent of country's trade surplus for last
year.
   Chilean Interior Minister Carlos Caceres went on national radio
and television Monday night and called the contamination an incident
of ``terrorism.''
   He declared that Chile is determined to remain ``a dependable
supplier'' to the international fruit market and said security has
been reinforced throughout the fruit-exporting process, ``from the
crop to the port of destiny.''
   The FDA began inspecting produce after the March 2 telephone
threat. Four days later, the FDA advised that the call was ``almost
certainly a hoax,'' but as a precaution, the agency said it had
detained Chilean fruit and would continue to examine samples.
   A second call was received by the embassy March 8 and the FDA
said it intensified its inspections.
   On Sunday, tests on fruit samples at the port in Philadelphia
found low levels of cyanide in two grapes, and FDA officials worked
through the night testing more samples but found no other tainted
grapes, said Fred Shank, acting deputy director of the FDA's Center
for Food Safety.
   ``We are confident we are out there in sufficient time to warn
the American consumer not to eat fruit derived from Chile,'' he
said. ``No fruit from Chile is being released for distribution in
the food supply. We are putting all the efforts that we reasonably
can to ... ensure its safety.''
   The FDA said consumers should not be worried about fruit consumed
in the past because cyanide is fast-acting.
   The two grapes in which the cyanide was confirmed had been
punctured and were discolored, with a ring of crystalline material
around the puncture area, the FDA said. A third grape located near
the other two was ``slashed'' but no cyanide was detected.
   Some cyanide occurs naturally in acidic fruit. Potassium or
sodium cyanide converts to hydrogen cyanide in such produce and then
can dissipate. Scientists could not determine how much of the poison
in the contaminated fruit had been introduced and how much might
have occurred naturally, the FDA said.
   In the March 2 threat, a Spanish-speaking man claimed that fruit
being exported from Chile would be poisoned. The call was
investigated by Chilean security officials and the U.S. State
Department, the FDA said.
   The grapes in which cyanide was found were shipped from Chile
three days before that threat, the FDA said.

   Mexico has banned imports of U.S. hogs because
they have not been vaccinated for hog cholera, a disease eradicated
in the United States for more than a decade, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, said today.
   Bentsen said trucks loaded with U.S. hogs are either on their way
or at the U.S.-Mexico border because the ban was imposed with little
or no prior warning. His office said hog trucks have been stopped at
the border since Friday, but it wasn't immediately clear whether
truckloads of hogs were waiting for entry to Mexico or turning back
to other markets.
   Bentsen said he had asked U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter to intervene and negotiate
an end to the trade barrier.
   Pat El-Hinnaway, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said the agency ``just
received official notification from Mexico'' about the ban. ``We are
in the process of translating it (from Spanish) and analyzing it,''
she said.
   Bentsen said hog cholera has been eradicated from the United
States for over a decade.
   ``In fact, it is illegal under U.S. law to vaccinate hogs against
hog cholera, and since the hogs in question are market hogs destined
for slaughter, such a vaccination would be moot in any case,'' he
said.
   He said the Mexican ban, ``which has no basis in scientific
fact,'' may be based on ``mistaken information.''
   The senator said he hoped an ``exchange of information'' would
resolve the ban. ``But if not, we should consider the remedies
available to us under our law and the international agreements to
which both Mexico and the United States are signatories,'' he said.
   The Agriculture Department said Mexico imported $11.5 million in
live market and breeder hogs in 1988, with most of the imports
occuring in the last seven months of the year. Before last June,
Mexico had a ``prohibitive'' 10 percent tariff on hog imports,
Bentsen's office said.
   In 1987, under the 10 percent tariff, Mexico imported only
$650,000 in U.S. hogs. This year's imports were expected to exceed
$11.5 million if they had continued at the current rate, the office
said.
   It quoted figures from the National Pork Producers Council
showing Mexico imported $9.5 million in live hogs from the United
States last year, excluding breeders.

   Supermarket chains and small grocers alike pulled grapes and
other fruit from Chile off the shelves after receiving a warning
from the Food and Drug Administration.
   The FDA, in one of the largest actions of its kind, issued the
warning against eating the fruit on Monday after traces of cyanide
were found in seedless red grapes shipped from the South American
country to Philadelphia.
   The cyanide was confirmed in testing ordered after an anonymous
threat to poison Chilean fruit was telephoned to the U.S. Embassy in
the Chilean capital of Santiago.
   Almost immediately, grocers began began destroying their Chilean
produce or putting it into cold storage until the FDA decides it is
safe to eat.
   The North Carolina-based Food Lion Stores Inc. chain is removing
fruit from Chile from its 581 stores in eight states, said
spokeswoman Dana Clark.
   ``All fruits from Chile will be pulled today and we will follow
the recommendation from the FDA on restocking,'' said Mike Mozingo,
a spokesman for the chain, which has stores in Florida, Georgia,
Tennessee, Maryland, South Carolina, Virginia and Delaware in
addition to North Carolina.
   Larry Rockafield, night manager at Larry's Market north of
Seattle, said 600 pounds of grapes and peaches had been removed to a
cooler for storage with 1,000 pounds of other Chilean fruit that is
being kept off the shelves for now.
   Virtually all the fresh grapes sold in the United States at this
time of year come from Chile, and grapes amount to about two-thirds
of the Chilean fruit sold in the United States, FDA officials said
in Washington.
   Other Chilean fruit sold in the United States at this time of
year includes peaches, blueberries, blackberries, seedless
watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew melons, raspberries, nectarines,
quince, Granny Smith green apples, cactus pears, pears and plums,
said Sue Hutchcroft, an FDA spokeswoman in Seattle.
   ``We haven't heard from the FDA, but we will be removing all
grapes from display and making refunds for those that were
purchased,'' said John Rhodes, a spokesman for Iowa-based Hy-Vee
Food Stores Inc., which operates 150 stores in seven Midwest states.
Rhodes said the Food Marketing Institute in Washington notified the
company Monday night.
   Ron Morgan, assistant manager at a Des Moines Super Valu store,
said employees removed all grapes regardless of origin. ``I think
ours come from California,'' Morgan said. ``But we're pulling them
off until we're sure.''
   In New York City, health inspectors would not be checking with
stores to make sure the fruit had been removed unless requested to
do so by the FDA, said Marvin Bogner, a spokesman for the city
Department of Health.
   The Hunts Point Market in the Bronx, a major produce distribution
point for area grocers, has imposed ``an airtight quarantine'' on
all produce from Chile, said Tom Kovacevich, chairman of the New
York Produce Trade Association.
   He said the organization had asked the FDA to clarify the problem
and identify what produce from Chile was affected.
   In Birmingham, Ala., Bruno's spokeswoman Beth Dunnaway says that
chain with over 200 stores in the Southeast also is complying. ``We
removed peaches, plums, necatrines, raspberries, and three varieties
of grapes _ red, white and blue,'' she said.
   Steve Sirles, director of produce sales for Richmond, Va.-based
Ukrop's Super Markets, said the Chilean grapes, peaches, plums,
nectarines and pears pulled Monday night from its 17 stores ``leaves
us with nothing. There's no alternative sources.''
   ``You hate to play in the hands of these people (possible
hoaxers), but you have to alert the public,'' said Bill Schroter,
spokesman for Publix supermarkets, Florida's second-largest chain.

<HEAD>California Schools Join in Lunchroom Ban of Apple Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apples and apple products remained in cold
storage at schools statewide today, as more districts joined in a
lunchroom ban triggered by concerns over a chemical used to control
the ripening of the fruit.
   Officials with the San Francisco Unified School District on
Monday joined a number of smaller California school districts in
banning apple sales in school cafeterias. The Los Angeles Unified
School District, the nation's second largest, prohibited lunchroom
sales of apples a day earlier.
   Many of the school districts also stopped serving apple products,
including applesauce and apple juice. Educators said they would
withhold sales pending tests by state health authorities.
   The bans are in response to a report by the non-profit Natural
Resources Defense Council that states the chemical daminozide, sold
under brand names including Alar, could increase the rate of cancer
in children.
   The Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing use of the
chemical. The manufacturer, Uniroyal Chemical Co. of Middlebury,
Conn., estimates use has dropped to about 5 percent of the U.S.
apple crop because of health concerns raised in recent years.
   The schools' decisions followed announcement last week that the
New York City School District, the nation's largest, had temporarily
quit selling apples.
   Apples, along with products such as applesauce and apple juice,
have been left in school pantries, awaiting results of further tests
on the chemical, used to slow ripening of apples, maintain firmness,
and improve their appearance at the supermarket.
   Also announcing Monday that apple sales had been banned were two
suburban Los Angeles area districts, the Compton Unified School
District and the Charter Oak School District, and the Huntington
Beach Union High School District in Orange County. Similar bans were
imposed by schools in Burbank, Las Virgenes and the Antelope Valley.
   The Visalia Unified School District in Northern California and
the San Juan, Sacramento City and Folsom Cordova school districts in
the Sacramento area also banned the fruit.

<HEAD>Pilots Ask That Trustee Run Eastern In Lorenzo's Place</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Line Pilots Association today asked a bankruptcy judge to
appoint a trustee to run Eastern Airlines in place of Frank Lorenzo,
charging that the chairman of parent Texas Air Corp. is trying to
strip the airline's assets.
   In other developments in the 11-day-old Machinists strike:
   _ALPA announced in Washington today a $9 million benefits package
for Eastern pilots whose refusal to cross Machinists' picket lines
brought the nation's seventh-largest airline to its knees.
   _The pilots union said members would refuse to fly Eastern planes
or routes that are sold to other airlines unless strike-supporting
Eastern pilots are hired with them.
   _The 8,500-member Machinists union late Monday asked U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland to order Eastern to free strikers'
paychecks from the week before the walkout. The union contends
Eastern is withholding about $9 million in pay and $1 million in
medical claims. A March 23 hearing was scheduled.
   _A federal judge in New York said he would issue an injunction
barring metropolitan-area commuter railroad workers from honoring
Eastern picket lines. U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr.,
who signed the order Monday, had issued a temporary restraining
order March 5 against such sympathy strikes.
   _Workers at other airlines were free to honor picket lines by
Eastern strikers as a temporary injunction expired today, but a
spokesman for the Machinists union said he knew of no plans to do
so. Four airlines _ United, USAir, Piedmont and TWA _ had sought an
extension of the injunction against picketing.
   In New York today, the pilots charged that Lorenzo has stripped
Eastern of its assets to support Texas Air and Eastern's sister
carrier, Continental Airlines, and should be barred from running
Eastern during bankruptcy proceedings.
   ``Lorenzo's stripping of Eastern's valuable assets constitutes at
a minimum gross mismanagement and incompetence,'' the union said.
``Either a sophisticated asset stripping is under way or management
is incompetent.
   ``In either event, entrusting Texas Air-controlled management
with reorganizing under Chapter 11 would harm the estate, its
creditors, preferred shareholders and employees.''
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent said a trustee would be unnecessary
because Eastern already has asked the judge to appoint an examiner
to review all transactions between Eastern and the affiliated
airlines during bankruptcy proceedings.
   ``With that protection for debtors and creditors, there doesn't
seem to be a need for a trustee,'' he said.
   Eastern, meanwhile, has boosted its strike-depleted daily
schedule to more than 100 flights and imposed wage cuts more severe
than its proposals that prompted the Machinists strike.
   The Miami-based carrier was scheduled to unveil plans today to
assist travelers who purchased tickets before last week's bankruptcy
filing. The compensation may include vouchers for future Eastern
travel or tickets on other airlines, Eastern said.
   An attorney for the airline also said Eastern would seek court
approval this week for the $365 million sale of its Northeast
shuttle to developer Donald Trump.
   Representatives of Eastern's pilots and Machinists unions said
they would challenge the deal. A Machinists official also said the
union was working on its own bankruptcy reorganization plan, which
could include a buyout of Eastern.
   With service restored between Miami and New York, Montreal and
San Juan, Puerto Rico, Eastern reported 104 domestic and Latin
American flights Monday.
   Eastern has said it hopes to build its schedule to 140 flights
before the weekend, a fraction of its pre-strike level of 1,040
flights a day. The airline has said about 200 of its 3,600 pilots
are crossing picket lines.
   The pilots union ridiculed the company's service plans. ``We
believe they will be significantly hampered in ever reaching these
stated goals because they don't have the pilots,'' Eastern pilots
spokesman Ron Cole said in Miami.
   Henry Duffy, pilots union president, said member pilots from 47
airlines would be assessed an average of $300 a month to support the
Eastern pilots and the union would draw from its $37 million strike
fund as the money is collected.
   ``All 41,000 pilots will reach deep into their pockets to help
the Eastern pilots who are reaching deep within themselves to cope
with the personal and professional risks of their action,'' Duffy
said.
   The wage cuts Eastern imposed Monday will reduce the wages of any
Machinists who cross picket lines and provide still lower pay to any
workers hired to replace strikers, officials said.
   ``This package would make Eastern the lowest-paid in the industry
(compared with major carriers),'' said Wally Haber, a general

<TEXT>
   The California subsidiary of the nation's
largest solid waste disposal company has agreed to pay $1 million in
criminal fines to settle one of the largest criminal antitrust cases
in state history.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner said the company, Waste Management
of California Inc., entered a plea Monday of no contest to one count
of conspiracy against trade and agreed to pay the maximum fine of $1
million. Two of its officials also entered no contest pleas.
   Waste Management, Western Waste Industries, Angelus-Hudson Inc.
and five of their employees were charged with conspiring to
eliminate competition and control prices in California's
multimillion-dollar commercial trash hauling industry.
   The prosecution has resulted in $2.2 million in fines so far.
   Prosecutors said the companies agreed not to take away each
other's customers and used below-cost sales ``blitzes'' to lure away
customers from businesses that refused to go along with the
agreement to divide up the state's trash hauling industry.
   Codefendant Western Waste pleaded no contest on Feb. 3 and agreed
to pay a $900,000 fine in the case as well as a $100,000 fine for an
unrelated toxic waste violation. Western Waste sales manager Ishkan
``Ara'' Grodian, 44, earlier agreed to a 45-day sentence in return
for a no contest plea.
   Municipal Court Judge Richard A. Paez accepted pleas from Waste
Management officials Wiley A. Scott Jr., 33, and Clifford R.
Chamblee, 65. Scott faces a possible maximum sentence of 60 days in
jail and Chamblee faces a possible maximum of 250 hours of community
service.
   Another defendant, John Marderosian, 56, pleaded no contest and
faced a possible maximum of 60 days in jail. Marderosian's former
employer, System Disposal Service Inc., a Los Angeles subsidiary of
a Canadian firm, paid $236,500 in civil penalties and costs in 1987
to settle its liability in the case.
   Charges against George Osepian, 70, a vice president of Western
Waste, are to be dismissed Friday ``in the interest of justice,''
according to a statement by Reiner's office.
   Angelus-Hudson, the smallest trash hauling firm charged, pleaded
no contest on Feb. 27 and agreed to pay a fine of $75,000.
   Waste Management of California is a branch of Waste Management
Inc. of Oak Brook, Ill.

   Car and light truck sales by the nation's Big
Three automakers slumped again in early March, dropping 15.7 percent
from the same time last year, the companies said Tuesday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said they
sold cars and light trucks at a combined rate of 29,281 per day
during the March 1-10 period this year, vs. 34,750 per day during
the same time last year.
   Overall, car sales were off 20.1 percent and truck sales were
down 8.1 percent. There were nine selling days in both periods.
Chrysler's car sales were off nearly 36 percent.
   Vehicle sales during early 1988 were particularly strong because
of company incentives. The Big Three offered enticements during the
period this year, but they lacked the draw they had during early
March last year.
   Automakers have seen their year-to-year sales figures drop below
last year's since the beginning of 1989. Typically, March and April
are strong selling periods and companies are keeping a careful eye
on buyer interest and their production schedules.
   For the year, car and light truck sales by the Big Three were off
8.7 percent compared with the Jan. 1-March 10 period last year. The
Big Three's car sales dropped 12 percent and truck sales were down
2.9 percent.
   Cars made by Chrysler sold at a rate of 2,471 per day in early
March this year, down 35.9 percent from the 3,852 daily rate during
the same period last year. Chrysler's car sales were down 20.9
percent on a year-to-year comparison.
   Chrysler's light trucks sold at a daily rate of 2,570 during the
period this year, down 8.5 percent from the 2,810 rate in early
March last year. Truck sales by Chrysler were up 3.5 percent for the
year.
   Ford said its car sales during early March were 21.4 percent
lower than the same period last year, going to a daily rate of 6,012
in 1989 from a 7,651 rate during the period last year. For the year,
Ford's car sales were 3.3 percent lower than last year's rate.
   On the truck side, Ford said its sales were down 20.6 percent in
early March, to a daily rate of 4,065 during the period this year
compared with a rate of 5,119 during the same time last year. Ford's
truck sales for the year were down 3.5 percent.
   GM said its early March car sales dropped to a daily rate of
9,175 during the March 1-10 period this year, down 13.4 percent from
the 10,597 daily sales rate in early March last year. GM's car sales
for the year ran 14.4 percent behind last year's pace.
   Light truck sales by GM were up 5.6 percent during the early part
of the month, rising to a daily rate of 4,987 this year, from a rate
of 4,721 during the same time last year. For the year, GM's trucks
are selling at a rate 5.8 percent behind last year's.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stocks rose sharply Tuesday, strengthened by what
market investors welcomed as an inflation-fighting budget plan from
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
   The market had been expecting Lawson to present a budget
comprised of relatively modest tax cuts. His plan was more fiscally
cautious than economists had forecast.
   Dealers noted that Lawson had left unchanged at 25 percent the
standard rate of tax, indicating restraint on the part of the
chancellor from further boosting consumer spending. The market had
widely expected a drop in the rate to 24 percent.
   Total taxes announced by Lawson will reduce revenue in fiscal
1990 by less than 2 billion pounds, the chancellor said. This
compares with expectations of a total cost of between 2 billion and
3 billion pounds.
   At the close the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 22.4 points, or 1.05 percent, at 2,125.4.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up 21.7 points at
1,761.1.
   The Financial Times 500-share index closed at 1,211.20, up 10.15.
   Volume totaled 587.1 million shares, up from 496.0 million shares
Monday.

   United Parcel Service has ordered 10 more Boeing
757-200PF jet freighters at a cost of about $500 million, the
jetliner maker said Tuesday.
   In 1985, UPS ordered 20 757-200PFs _ for ``package freighters'' _
and took options on another 15. Today's order converts 10 of those
options into firm sales.
   Fifteen planes from the original order have been delivered, with
the first going into service in September 1987. The newly ordered
planes will be delivered between August 1991 through 1992, Boeing
said.
   The 757-200PF is a windowless, twin-engine jet designed to
accomodate 15 cargo containers or pallets on its main deck. The
mid-sized plane has a large cargo door on its left forward fuselage
and can fly extended routes, making it suitable for either domestic
or international operations.
   Boeing has now received 422 orders for 757s, including 33
freighters.
   UPS, based in Greenwich, Conn., has its domestic airfreight hub
in Louisville, Ky., and international hubs in Hong Kong, Singapore
and West Germany. The latest order will expand its jet fleet to 114
aircraft.

   Cray Research Inc. has expanded its latest
line of supercomputers to include 19 machines priced from $5 million
to $23.7 million each, the company announced Tuesday.
   The most powerful version of the Cray Y-MP computers will be able
to perform up to 2.7 billion calculations per second. The Cray 3,
which is still on the drawing boards and is based on unproven chip
technology, could reach speeds of 16 billion calculations per second.
   Cray is the world's biggest maker of supercomputers, which are
used for high-powered scientific and engineering work. Its rivals
include Control Data Corp. and Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd.
   The first Cray Y-MP model was introduced in February 1988, an
improvement over the Cray X-MP line. The largest Y-MP model, with
eight processors, will be about three times more powerful than the
largest X-MP and about 30 times more powerful than the Cray-1 system
introduced in 1976, said Marcelo Gumucio, president and chief
operating officer of Cray Research.
   He said the new product line will provide Cray customers with the
potential for convenient upgrades. Some are already available, but
the versions with the maximum memory won't be available until the
second quarter of 1990, the company said.

   The stock market rebounded in featureless trading
today, as investors awaited Wednesday's merchandise trade deficit
report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 5.71 points at
2,311.96 at 2 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator had risen 3.39
points an hour after the opening bell but slid throughout the
morning.
   Advancing issues barely outpaced decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 673 issues up, 657 down and 568 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 99.8 million shares.
   Stocks got an early boost as they tracked a rally in the bond
market following release of February retail sales figures.
   The government reported that retail sales last month declined 0.4
percent from January. That signaled good news for the bond market
because it suggested an easing of consumer spending and reduced
worries about inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income
securities such as notes and bonds.
   By mid-morning, the enthusiasm fizzled and the stock market
drifted lower in the face of a weakening dollar and as institutional
investors turned their attention to Wednesday's government report on
the merchandise trade deficit for January.
   ``Institutional investors are sitting on the sidelines to watch
for tomorrow's trade figures,'' said Philip Puccio, senior vice
president at Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
   Volume, which was light at the opening, remained lackluster as
the trading day progressed.
   ``Volume is light because of the number of economic figures due
out this week,'' said John Burnett, senior vice president of
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ``The market is acting like the
numbers are going to be good but it's a skittish market.''
   Some economists have predicted that the U.S. trade deficit for
January will narrow from $10.23 billion in December to about $9.7
billion.
   But investors also are awaiting other information on the
economy's health following last Friday's report showing unemployment
fell to a 15-year low in February. That report sent inflationary
shivers through the market as investors reasoned that strains on the
capacity of the labor force might stir inflation and result in
higher interest rates.
   Reports on housing sales, industrial production and wholesale
prices are due out later in the week.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.08 at 166.08.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index advanced
0.03 to 330.57.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top European agriculture official
Tuesday rebuked the United States for pressing Europeans to make
sharp changes in their farm policies while failing to do likewise at
home.
   Ray MacSharry, agriculture chief for the 12-nation European
Economic Community, urged the United States to recognize in trade
negotiations the measures adopted by the trading bloc to curb
production and farm subsidies.
   ``Reductions were not achieved without considerable effort on our
part and sacrifice by the farming community...'' he said in a speech
to the International Chamber of Commerce in Brussels. ``Others
should follow our lead instead of stepping in to profit from our
efforts.''
   He also said, ``We should ensure that the sacrifices of one
negotiating party are not stripped of their value by the opportunism
of another.''
   MacSharry appeared to be trying to put the United States on the
defensive in a dispute between the two sides over an American demand
for sharp cuts in European farm subsidies. The fight has stalled the
latest round of international trade negotiations.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills met over the weekend with MacSharry and
Frans Andriessen, the EEC's top trade official, to try to resolve
the issue.
   The international trade talks, sponsored by the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, resume April 5 in Geneva.
   MacSharry said he told Yeutter and Mrs. Hills: ``We must get
credit for our reductions in support.''
   Last year European leaders limited the maxium annual amount spent
on price guarantees over five years. U.S. officials contend the
measures were not enough to fix a fundamentally flawed system and
want more long-term changes.
   MacSharry reiterated the EEC's position that it ``cannot
subscribe to revolutionary changes of its policy.''
   ``We...are asked not only to freeze but also to reduce
agricultural support,'' he said. ``My reaction to this is that the
reductions we have achieved already in some of our suprlus products
have been, to put it mildly, impressive.''
   He said quotas imposed in 1984 have cut milk production by 11
million metric tons and meant the reduction of 3.6 million head of
dairy cattle in 1986-88.
   As a result, he said the EEC has contributed to stabilizing a
sector marked by overproduction and low world prices.
   ``It is, therefore, to say the least, unfortunate that, in 1988,
increased production in the United States, Canada and Australia
alone has offset reductions achieved in the community,'' he said.
   The EEC provides costly subsidies to farmers through guaranteed
prices for many crops. It also gives exporters help so more
expensive European farm prdoucts can compete with lower prices on
the world market.
   The United States complains the export subsidies have helped the
community increase its share of the world market. It has fought back
with its own Export Enhancement Program.

<HEAD>Record Withdrawals From Thrifts in January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Depositors withdrew a record $10.7 billion from
the nation's savings and loan institutions in January, in one month
surpassing withdrawals for all of 1988, the government said today.
   James Barth, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
said four of every five of the nation's 2,945 S&amp;Ls had deposit
outflows in January.
   Barth said a preliminary estimate shows withdrawals declining
only slightly in February to between $8 billion and $9 billion. Net
withdrawals for all of 1988 were $8.6 billion.
   Barth attributed the bulk of the withdrawals this year to the
fact that competitors, such as money market mutual funds, have more
promptly increased interest rates than thrifts have on savings
accounts. In January, money market funds, on average, offered rates
1.25 percentage points higher than S&amp;Ls, he said.
   Another portion of the withdrawals occurred as part of a
deliberate strategy by regulators to shrink ailing institutions, he
said.
   However, Barth acknowledged that some of the withdrawals were
caused by confidence problems amid growing publicity about the
condition of the industry.
   President Bush announced his plan for restoring S&amp;Ls to health on
Feb. 6. In the weeks immediately preceding that, the administration
floated a proposal, since abandoned, to charge bank and S&amp;L
depositors a fee to help rescue the S&amp;L insurance fund.
   ``That sort of talk undoubtedly induced some people to believe,
`Why keep your deposits at thrifts,''' Barth said.
   February would mark the fourth consecutive month of heavy
outflows from S&amp;Ls. Outflows totaled $8.3 billion in December and
$7.0 billion in November. From May through October, outflows totaled
$9.4 billion.
   In the first four months of 1988 there were deposit inflows of
$16.2 billion as investors pulled their money out of the volatile
stock market and put it into federally insured institutions.
   Net deposit flows do not include interest credited to savings
accounts. Including the interest, S&amp;L deposits grew 4.2 percent in
1988, the slowest pace since the recession year of 1981.

<TEXT>
   A member of British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government attacked part of the new U.S. trade law on
Tuesday as protectionism ``masquerading as a tool to open up other
markets.''
   Trade Secretary Lord Young attacked a provision known as
``super-301,'' signed into law by former President Reagan in August.
It threatens retaliation against countries which run persistent
trade surpluses with the United States through what are judged to be
unfair means.
   ``I do not believe that problems in world trade can be a matter
for forced settlements, negotiated according to a timetable set by
one party's legislature with a threat of unilateral trade action
hanging over the other party's head,'' Young said in a speech at the
National Press Club.
   Young said he criticized the provision in visits with U.S.
officials. On Tuesday he saw Carla Hills, the U.S. trade
representative. He has also seen Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.
   Later Tuesday, in a speech in New York, Young said Americans need
not worry that they will be excluded as the European Economic
Community moves toward creating a single, borderless market by the
end of 1992.
   ``It simply is not in our own interest to adopt protectionism,''
he told the United States Council for International Business. ``If
we cannot compete, we will not survive.''
   With its emphasis on deregulation, Young said, ``1992 is in many
ways about the Thatcherization of Europe.''
   In Washington, Young was critical of a bill that did not become
law, which would have required registration of foreign investment in
U.S. firms. He said it would have put extra conditions on foreign
investment.
   Britain is the largest foreign investor in the United States and
vice versa, he noted.

   The stock market drifted in dull afternoon
trading after seesawing through much of the session as skittish
investors awaited Wednesday's merchandise trade deficit report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.32 points at
2,308.57 at 3 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was up 5.71 points
an hour earlier.
   Declining issues barely outpaced advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 704 issues down, 638 up and 580 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 119.6 million shares.
   The stock market tracked an early rally in the bond market
following an unexpected 0.4 percent drop in retail sales last month.
   ``The consensus was looking for flat to up 0.4 percent and that
helped relieve concern that the economy is overheating,'' said
Alfred E. Goldman, vice president for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
   By mid-morning, the enthusiasm fizzled and the stock market
drifted lower in the face of a weakening dollar. Investors fear a
lower dollar will lead to inflation, credit-tightening by the
Federal Reserve and surging interest rates.
   After staging a brief rally around midday, the market began
drifting with little apparent direction.
   Volume remained light with institutional investors taking to the
sidelines to await the U.S. merchandise trade deficit report for
January, analysts said. The report is scheduled to be released on
Wednesday.
   Some economists have predicted that the U.S. trade deficit for
January will narrow from $10.23 billion in December to about $9.7
billion.
   In addition, investors are awaiting reports later in the week on
housing sales, industrial production and wholesale prices to
determine whether the Federal Reserve's tight credit policy is
working.
   Last Friday's data showing unemployment fell to a 15-year low in
February sent inflationary shivers through the market as investors
reasoned that strains on the capacity of the labor force might stir
inflation and result in higher interest rates. The market bounced
back from a brief sell-off but volume has remained light.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Volume was light and the absence of fresh news left most of the
markets trading in narrow ranges. An early bout of profit-taking
pressured wheat and it never rebounded very far, despite several
recent sessions of rising prices prompted by the unusually dry
weather.
   Although the 30-day forecast from the National Weather Service
called for drier-than-normal conditions in winter wheat regions,
some predictions of rain this weekend dampened most traders' buying
moods.
   On the close, wheat was 2 cents lower to 1} cents higher, with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.36{ a bushel; corn was 1\

<TEXT>
   The snow and ice storm earlier this month
caused as much as $100 million in losses in three states and
probably will force up chicken prices this year across the country,
officials said Tuesday.
   The storm, which officials have called one of the worst blows to
the poultry industry on record, destroyed nearly 600 chicken houses
in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri, said Bill Roenigk of the
National Broiler Council in Washington.
   Roenigk said one estimate put total damage in the three states at
$100 million.
   A report from Bart Brorsen, executive director of the Oklahoma
Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service, said the storm
caused $21.8 million in damage to equipment and buildings in the
state's poultry industry, mostly in 10 eastern counties.
   The report did not put a price on the 3.9 million chickens or
1,201 head of livestock reported lost.
   Gov. Henry Bellmon has asked Secretary of Agriculture Clayton
Yeutter to designate 16 counties as disaster areas.
   Roenigk, in a telephone interview, said the damage to poultry
will cause the national retail price of whole broiler chickens to
increase 2 to 4 cents a pound. The average price for whole broilers
in 1988 was 85 cents, he said.
   Roenigk said many poultry farmers were insured for wind and fire
damage, but not snow and ice.

   U.S. fruit growers and distributors tried to reassure consumers
Tuesday that their products were safe as grocers nationwide stopped
selling Chilean grapes and other produce from that country because
of an apparent cyanide poisoning attempt.
   Meanwhile, industry spokesmen said retailers and wholesalers
hoped to disassociate their products from those imported from Chile
by putting up ``Produced in the U.S.A.'' signs.
   ``We want to make it clear that this Chilean thing is a radical
act that has nothing to do with growers in California and it's not a
pesticide-related incident,'' said Marilyn Watkins, spokeswoman for
Sacramento, Calif.-based Blue Anchor Inc., one of the nation's
largest fruit distributors.
   The Food and Drug Administration urged Tuesday that all fruit
from Chile be removed from U.S. markets after traces of cyanide were
found in seedless red grapes shipped to Philadelphia from the South
American country. It also asked Americans to discard all fruit
unless they know it isn't from Chile.
   The cyanide poison was confirmed in testing ordered after an
anonymous threat to poison Chilean fruit was telephoned to th apples, cactus
pears, pears
and plums.
   However, industry experts say most of the winter pears on the
stands are from the Northwest.
   ``I hope this (scare) doesn't affect the remainder of our
product,'' said Maggie Andre, a spokeswoman for the Portland,
Ore.-based Oregon Washington California Pear Bureau.
   She said all anjou pears are domestically produced, while part of
the bosc variety of pears is grown in the United States and part in
Chile. None of the bartlett pears are grown domestically.
   Andre said retailers and wholesalers nationwide ``are indicating
they're going to put signs up on all of their produce as saying,
`Produced in the U.S.A.'''

   Stock prices were most lower in dull trading
today.
   About five minutes before the close, the Dow Jones Average of 30

   Stock prices were mostly unchanged in lackluster
trading today after a seesaw session in which investors were
reluctant to make commitments ahead of Wednesday's merchandise trade
deficit report.
   The market opened relatively strong on the heels of a bond market
rally following an unexpected 0.4 percent drop in retail sales last
month.
   ``The consensus was looking for flat to up 0.4 percent and that
helped relieve concern that the economy is overheating,'' said
Alfred E. Goldman, vice president for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
   The report stimulated speculation that consumer spending has
eased and that inflation is beginning to subside.
   But by mid-morning, the enthusiasm fizzled and the stock market
drifted lower in the face of a weakening dollar, which suggested the
possibility of higher inflation, further credit-tightening by the
Federal Reserve and higher interest rates.
   After staging a brief rally around midday, the market began
drifting with little apparent direction.
   Volume remained light with institutional investors taking to the
sidelines to await the U.S. merchandise trade deficit report for
January, analysts said. The report is scheduled to be released on
Wednesday.
   ``Basically, after some upward stimulation and feeling that maybe
the economy is slowing the market has gone back into hybernation to
await the trade figures,'' Goldman said.
   Some economists have forecast a narrowing of the U.S. merchandise
trade deficit in January to about $9.7 billion from $10.23 billion
in December.
   In addition, investors were awaiting reports later in the week on
housing sales, industrial production and wholesale prices to
determine whether the Federal Reserve's tight credit policy is
working.
   Last Friday's data showing unemployment fell to a 15-year low in
February sent inflationary shivers through the market as investors
reasoned that strains on the capacity of the labor force might stir
inflation and result in higher interest rates. The market bounced
back from a brief sell-off but volume has remained light.

   Eastern Airlines pilots asked a federal judge
Tuesday to appoint a trustee to run the carrier, alleging that Frank
Lorenzo, chairman of parent Texas Air Corp., was stripping Eastern's
assets to bolster affiliated carriers.
   The Air Line Pilots Association stated in papers filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court that Lorenzo systematically has funneled Eastern
assets to Texas Air and Continental Airlines in a plan dating to the
1986 acquisition of Eastern.
   In other deveopments in Eastern's Chapter 11 proceedings, U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland approved Eastern's plan to
compensate holders of unused tickets while striking Machinists asked
the judge to order payment of $10 million in back wages and medical
claims.
   Lifland set an April 7 hearing on the trustee motion.
   ``Lorenzo's stripping of Eastern's valuable assets constitutes at
a minimum gross mismanagement and incompetence,'' Farrell
Kupersmith, a financial adviser to the pilots, stated in court
documents. ``Either a sophisticated asset stripping is under way or
management is incompetent.
   ``In either event, entrusting Texas Air-controlled management
with reorganizing under Chapter 11 would harm the estate, its
creditors, preferred shareholders and employees.''
   Losing about $4 million a day during a walkout by mechanics,
pilots and flight attendants that began March 4, Eastern sought
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law
last Thursday. Any substantial corporate changes by Eastern now are
subject to approval by Lifland.
   Union officials and some industry analysts have maintained that
Lorenzo plans to sell off much of Eastern's $4.5 billion in assets.
Under one scenario, he would cut the airline down and merge it with
Continenal.
   Lorenzo has said he intends to run a scaled-down Eastern
separately and denies he is stripping Eastern's assets to funnel
money into Texas Air or Continental.
   But the court motion cites several examples of asset transfers
the union says weakened Eastern, including:
   _Transfer of a national computerized reservation system to Texas
Air for $100 million shortly after Texas Air bought the ailing
carrier. The motion says Eastern recently valued the system at $750
million.
   _A $40 million loan to Continental last spring at a time when
Eastern applied for a $105 million pension contribution waiver.
   _A $22 million payment to Continental for strike-related services
in December 1987 and another $19 million payment last fall for
similar services that have not been used.
   _Eastern's $11 million sale to Continental of 11 Newark
International Airport gates allegedly worth twice as much.
   _The pending sale of the Northeast shuttle to Donald Trump for
$365 million, which the pilots claim will result in a $30 million to
$40 million reduction in operating cash flow for Eastern.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent said a trustee would be unnecessary
because Eastern already has asked the judge to appoint an examiner
to review all transactions between Eastern and the affiliated
airlines during bankruptcy proceedings.
   ``With that protection for debtors and creditors, there doesn't
seem to be a need for a trustee,'' he said.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes said Eastern requested an examiner
to ``dispel the misconceptions being promoted by its unions that the
affiliated transactions are somehow not necessarily in the best
interest of Eastern.''
   Separately, Lifland approved Eastern's plan to reimburse
customers with unused tickets, which are worth an estimated $200
million.
   Under the plan, passengers would receive a replacement ticket
when Eastern begins flying the canceled route, plus a companion
ticket at a 50 percent discount. Alternatively, the airline would
allow passengers to transfer 25 percent of the value of the old
ticket on each of four new ones.
   Also Tuesday, Lifland set a March 23 hearing on a Machinists
request to order Eastern to release pre-strike paychecks. The motion
says Eastern is unfairly withholding about $9 million in pay and $1
million in medical claims, said Robert Clayman, an attorney for the
union.
   The back pay covers Feb. 27 to March 5. Clayman said paychecks
issued last Wednesday _ a day before Eastern sought bankruptcy
protection _ were not honored and no other checks were issued.
   ``In light of the fact that active employees have been paid for
work performed prior to the bankruptcy, the IAM employees should be
treated in the same manner,'' he said. ``Eastern received the
benefit of that labor and now they're not paying for it.''

<TEXT>
   An investor group that includes Coldwell Banker
Commercial Group management is nearing purchase of the unit from
parent Sears, Roebuck and Co. for about $300 million, a source close
to the negotiations said Tuesday.
   In announcing restructuring plans last Oct. 31, the retailing
giant said it intended to sell Coldwell Banker's commercial unit,
while retaining ownership of the residential unit.
   ``We can confirm Sears is in the process of selling the
commercial unit,'' company spokesman Doug Fairweather said Tuesday.
   ``It's been part of the plan all along to sell off some parts and
strengthen that part of our business that focuses on the consumer,''
he said, but declined to elaborate further.
   Sears announced Monday that it was reducing the number of
in-store Dean Witter Reynolds financial-services outlets from about
300 to about 150, and converting virtually all Coldwell Banker
outlets into marketing and referral booths.
   The investment banker in the Coldwell Banker deal is
Washington-based Carlyle Group, whose co-chairman is former
Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci. Carlucci also served previously
as chairman of Sears' exporting arm, Sears World Inc., from 1983 to
1986.
   The Hillman family of Pittsburgh also is to be involved in
ownership of the new unit, along with current top Coldwell Banker
Commercial staff led by the unit's president Gary Beban, said the
source close to the negotiations, who declined to be identified.
Beban is a former professional football player.
   Coldwell Banker Commercial group, which operates 99 offices
around the county and employs about 5,200 people, accounted for
revenues of $460 million last year.

   Americans import about 30 percent of the fruit
and vegetables they consume, chiefly such fresh items as grapes and
tomatoes, and the potential economic impact of the Chile cyanide
case is considerable, government and trade analysts said Tuesday.
   They said a growing American appetite for fruit and vegetables
has gradually boosted imports of apples, grapes, tomatoes and other
items.
   According to the Agriculture Department, grape imports from Chile
grew to about 260,000 tons in 1988 from 213,000 in 1987, 175,000 in
1986, 169,000 in 1985, 132,000 in 1984, and 108,000 in 1983. Just 10
years ago, in 1979, only 33,000 tons of Chilean grapes were
imported, the department said.
   Removal of Chilean grapes and other fruit from American food
stores following discovery of two grapes from Chile bearing traces
of cyanide is bound to be felt in the food industry but the extent
of damage is hard to determine, said John McClung of the United
Fruit and Vegetable Association, a trade group.
   ``We don't know how long this is going to go on,'' McClung said.
``It's too soon to tell the economic impact, but the potential is
considerable, both in Chile and the United States.''
   McClung said Americans annually import about 30 percent of the
fruit and vegetables they consume, most of it in the form of fresh
produce, such as grapes, apples and tomatoes.
   ``Chile is the big supplier of fruit,'' McClung said. ``In
vegetables, it's mainly Mexico.''
   The Agriculture Department says U.S. fresh fruit imports alone
reached almost 3.62 million metric tons in 1987, up about 2 percent
from 3.56 million tons in 1986. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds.
   Bananas made up 81 percent of the 1987 fresh fruit imports,
followed by grapes with 6.9 percent and apples with 3.7 percent.
   The bananas came mostly from Ecuador, Colombia and the so-called
Caribbean Basin Initiative countries of Honduras, Costa Rica,
Panama, Guatemala and the Bahamas. Grapes mostly were from Chile,
and apples from Canada, Chile and New Zealand.
   A 1983 law gave 27 countries in the Caribbean Basin duty free
access to U.S. markets for 12 years.
   Chile has passed South Africa, Australia and Argentina to become
the leading supplier of fresh fruit to North America and Europe
during the Northern Hemisphere's winter months.
   About 75 percent of Chile's grapes are shipped to the United
States, and a large percentage of its apples go to Europe. But some
apples also go to the United States where they compete with the
domestic crop. Pears are another major Chilean item for the U.S.
market, according to USDA analysts.
   ``Chile has a climate somewhat like ours,'' McClung said in an
interview. ``It's not a tropical climate, so they're able to produce
stone fruit like peaches, nectarines, plums, that kind of fruit. And
those are popular in this country.''
   McClung said the trade was stunned by what happened to the
Chilean grapes and was at a loss to speculate on what may happen
next.
   ``Honestly, I'm unaware of anything like this from any place,
ever,'' he said. ``But I suppose if someone is intent on a criminal
or terrorist act regarding the tainting of produce, it can probably
be accomplished.''
   At the USDA, analyst Ben W. Huang of the department's Economic
Research Service said it was ``too early to say'' what impact the
incident may have on U.S. food supplies.
   John J. VanSickle of the University of Florida said in a new
report just issued by the USDA agency that Florida vegetable growers
are concerned about competition from the Caribbean Initiative
countries.
   ``Florida and Mexico have long battled for supremacy in the
winter fresh vegetable industry,'' he said.
   VanSickle said Florida's share of the winter vegetable market has
grown only in tomatoes, rising to 51.9 percent of U.S. consumption
in 1986-87 from 42.4 percent in 1975-76.
   ``Florida's share of the eggplant market remained fairly stable,
while the share of all other commodities fell, with bell peppers,
cucumbers, beans and squash each falling between 10 percent and 19.8
percent,'' he said.
   Even so, Florida's actual production of these vegetables has
increased, with the exception of beans, VanSickle said. The decline
in the shares of the U.S. market shows the tremendous growth that
has taken place in consumption.

   The dollar ended weaker against most key
currencies in quiet trading Tuesday following the release of what
foreign exchange dealers called disappointing U.S. retail sales
figures.
   Gold prices strengthened. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid of $395.50 a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EST, up
$2.50 from Monday's late bid.
   Earl I. Johnson, a currency dealer at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in
Chicago, said the dollar was depressed by a Commerce Department
report showing February retail sales had fallen 0.4 percent.
   ``It was slightly disappointing,'' Johnson said. ``The market had
expected sales to go up 0.5 percent.''
   Johnson said the decline lessened the possibility of higher
interest rates, which often helps firm the dollar.
   Dealers said domestic trading was quiet in advance of Wednesday's
release of the January merchandise trade report.
   Overseas, traders said the British pound gained from the dollar's
weakness. Sterling also was buoyed by the national budget for the
1989-1990 fiscal year announced to the House of Commons by
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
   In London, one pound cost $1.7170, more expensive for buyers than
Monday's late $1.7125. Sterling fetched $1.7280 in New York, up from
$1.71295.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 129.92 Japanese yen from
129.57 late Monday. The dollar traded at 129.85 yen in London, and
at 129.79 yen in New York, down from 130.175.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
rates, included: 1.86075 West German marks, down from 1.8675; 1.5930
Swiss francs, down from 1.5970; 1.19385 Canadian dollars, down from
1.19815; 6.3065 French francs, down from 6.3252; and 1,365.75
Italian lire, down from 1,369.25.
   Late dollar rates in Europe included: 1.8630 West German marks,
down from 1.8669; 1.5935 Swiss francs, down from 1.5965; 6.3125
French francs, down from 6.3230; 2.1010 Dutch guilders, down from
2.1040; 1,366.12 Italian lire, down from 1,367.40; 1.1970 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1981.
   Traders said gold prices rose because of internal market
influences and firmer prices for oil. The gold market historically
has tracked energy prices because of their impact on inflation.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $396.20 a troy ounce, up from Monday's $394.40.
   Gold settled in London at a bid $395.75 an ounce, up from
$392.25. The closing price in Zurich was $395.25 an ounce, up from
$392.75.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $395.37 an ounce, up
from $394.85.
   Silver prices also gained ground. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $6.176 a troy ounce, up from
$6.078 Monday. Silver rose in London to $6.17 an ounce from $6.02.

<HEAD>Ford Joins in Plans for `Pony Ride' to Mark Mustang Anniversary</HEAD>

   It promises to be an unusual sight _ 37 vintage
Ford Mustangs, each with a European license plate, winding their way
through the country on a 7,000-mile, two-month tour.
   The ``American Pony Drive'' begins March 24 in Jacksonville,
Fla., and ends May 9 in Baltimore. It is being held in conjunction
with next month's 25th anniversary of the beginning of Mustang
production.
   The drive was the idea of John Manners, of Baar, Switzerland, who
said Ford Motor Co. initially wasn't interested in the project.
   ``We went ahead thinking if we could cause enough chaos, Ford
would have to come in,'' he told a news conference Tuesday.
   It worked.
   ``I think we felt it was a great idea, but we wondered if he
could pull this off,'' Ford spokesman Dave Krupp said. Manners'
enthusiasm for the project persuaded Ford to become part of it,
Krupp said.
   Ford will provide eight support vehicles, including a truck with
spare Mustang parts. It also has notified dealers along the route to
be on the lookout for a string of old Mustangs, some of which may
need a little service during the drive.
   The course will take the two-driver teams _ 32 from Switzerland,
four from England and one from Holland _ across the South to
California then loop back and head north through Tennessee and
Kentucky toward Michigan. Then they'll steer east through
Pennsylvania and into Maryland, where the cars will be loaded onto
ships and sent home.
   Manners said the cost for each team and vehicle taking part will
be about $12,000. Short-term insurance, which Manners said was the
biggest problem in arranging the trip, is being handled on a fleet
basis.
   ``Two people have taken mortgages on their houses to do it,'' he
said.
   Much of any needed service on the cars will be handled by the
teams or Mustang car clubs along the route, some of which also have
planned dinners and shows to welcome the Europeans.
   Ford's first Mustang rolled off the line at its Dearborn assembly
plant on April 17, 1964. The car has been the only product at the
factory since then, and the plant is the only one in the nation that
has built the Mustang.
   The base price for the 1964 Mustang was $2,368. A 1989 Mustang
carries a base price of $9,450.

   Federal regulators on Tuesday formally approved
the sale of a new type of security that allows investors to bet on
the direction of the stock market as a whole rather than purchasing
individual stocks.
   However, the decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission
was challenged immediately in court by the nation's two largest
futures exchanges, which could lose business from the new
competition from stock exchanges.
   The futures exchanges contended that the new investment
instrument, known as a stock-basket, was a thinly disguised stock
index future. Stock index futures also allow investors an
opportunity to bet on the overall direction of the stock market.
   The SEC voted unanimously to approve the stock-baskets proposed
by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and the
Chicago Board Options Exchange.
   In granting the requests, the SEC rejected arguments that the new
products should be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and not the SEC.
   The SEC action prompted a court challenge by the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. The two futures
exchanges filed suit in a U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago,
contending that the SEC had exceeded its jurisdiction.
   The stock baskets would be priced to reflect increases and
declines in broad market averages such as the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index.
   The Philadelphia exchange submitted its request to trade in a
product it designated as a Cash Index Participation in February
1988. Similar proposals were submitted by the American Stock
Exchange last April for sale of an Equity Index Partipation. The
Chicago Board Options Exchange named its product a Value Index
Participation in requesting SEC approval last May.
   All of the index participation products would be based on the
current value of various indexes of stocks. Investors would receive
quarterly cash payments equal to a proportionate share of any
regular cash dividend declared on the component stocks of the
underlying index.
   Officials of the Philadelphia and American stock exchanges had
hoped to offer their index products beginning next month but after
the suit was filed, officials said it would be up to the court to
decide whether to allow the products to go on sale while the legal
issues were being resolved.
   Nicholas A. Giordano, president of the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange, said that the court suit was ``yet another desperate
attempt by certain futures exchanges to avoid competition.'' He said
it would prevent ``the introduction of a product that could add
depth, liquidity and stability to the marketplace.''

<HEAD>Dishwasher Switch Can Cause Fire, Whirlpool Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whirlpool Corp. is making a third
attempt to reach owners of dishwashers with pushbutton selector
switches that can cause fires, the company said Monday.
   Whirlpool said 75,000 undercounter dishwashers sold nationwide
from 1986 until July 1988 were made with a switch that could arc
after exposure to moisture and start a fire.
   Forty fires have been reported. No one was seriously injured in
the blazes, but two people were treated for smoke inhalation,
Whirlpool spokeswoman Joy Schrage said.
   After two alerts in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission, in July and August 1988, the switches have been
replaced on 56,000 of the machines. Owners of the remaining 18,000
have not been heard from, Schrage said.
   The dishwasher model numbers are on the right front edge of the
tub. The affected models are DU7400XS-0, DU7600S-0, DU7800XS-0,
DU9000XR-0 and DU9000XR-1, the company said.
   Whirlpool said owners should not use the machine, should leave
the door unlatched and call 1-800-541-5746 to arrange for free
repair.

<HEAD>Rouge Steel To Sell Ore Carriers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rouge Steel Co. will sell its three Great Lakes
ore freighters, ending its 65-year involvement in the steamship
business, the Ford Motor Co. subsidiary said Monday.
   Rouge Steel said it had agreed to sell the William Clay Ford, the
Benson Ford and the out-of-service Henry Ford II for an undisclosed
price to Lakes Shipping Co. Inc., an affiliate of Interlake
Steamship Co. of Cleveland.
   The steel company will then negotiate a contract with Interlake
Steamship for transportation of ore, spokesman Bill Peacock said.
   Rouge Steel began producing steel in 1919, began operating its
own ore freighters in 1924 and had as many as five freighters in the
1950s, Peacock said. The company has 4,000 employees and sells about
40 percent of its steel to Ford Motor Co.
   Rouge Steel has experienced the same slackening of demand that
has hit the rest of the steel industry, and in the past two years it
sold the freighter Ernest R. Breech and mothballed the Henry Ford II.
   With two ships operating, the company was too vulnerable to any
problem with either one, and elected to contract for ore
transportation, Peacock said.

   Crude oil futures prices climbed further in light
trading Tuesday amid more signs that OPEC members are honoring
production quotas.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, rose 26 cents
to settle at $19.29 a barrel. On Monday, the April contract picked
up 53 cents, closing above $19 a barrel for the first time since
Jan. 19.
   Refined products traded on the exchange also advanced Tuesday.
The April contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.34 cent to settle at
53.50 cents a gallon, while heating oil edged up 0.05 cent to close
at 52.40 cents a gallon.
   Andrew Lebow, a senior broker with E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., partly attributed the gains to news that Saudi Arabia
was cutting back on crude shipments to Japan by 45,000 barrels a day.
   The report sparked buying on Far East oil markets, which in turn
influenced prices in Europe and New York, Lebow said.
   Traders interpreted the development as further evidence the
Saudis, the largest producers in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, were abiding by their 4.5 million-barrel daily
quota for crude output, Lebow said.
   OPEC members set an overall ceiling of 18.5 million barrels a day
late last year. Analysts have said the cartel appeared to be holding
to its quota.
   Lebow said some buying Tuesday came on momentum from gains a day
earlier, which were partly attributed to a fire that forced the
closing of seven Norwegian crude oil fields in the North Sea.
   The seven fields produce an average of 250,000 barrels a day of
crude oil and about 1 billion cubic feet of gas.

   The stock market turned in a dull performance
Tuesday with prices generally edging lower as investors awaited
release of new U.S. trade deficit figures.
   ``Essentially it was a dead market,'' said Emmanuel Geronimous,
senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``There were no
major sales and no major buys.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended the day unchanged
at 2,306.25.
   Declining issues barely outpaced advancers in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 722 issues down, 670
up and 554 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 139.97 million
shares, down from 140.40 million in the previous session. Analysts
attributed the light volume to a lack of participation by
institutional investors, who were awaiting a slew of economic
reports later this week.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 166.36 million shares.
   The market opened higher on the heels of a bond market rally that
followed the government's report of an unexpected 0.4 percent drop
in retail sales last month.
   ``The consensus was looking for flat to up 0.4 percent and that
helped relieve concern that the economy is overheating,'' said
Alfred E. Goldman, vice president for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
   The report stimulated speculation that consumer spending has
eased and that inflation is beginning to subside.
   But by mid-morning, the enthusiasm fizzled and the stock market
drifted lower in the face of a weakening dollar, which suggested the
possibility of higher inflation, further credit-tightening by the
Federal Reserve and higher interest rates.
   After rallying briefly around midday, the market drifted through
the rest of the session on light trading volume as big institutional
investors left the market to await the government trade report
scheduled for Wednesday in Washington.
   ``Basically, after some upward stimulation and feeling that maybe
the economy is slowing the market has gone back into hibernation to
await the trade figures,'' Goldman said.
   Some economists have forecast a narrowing of the U.S. merchandise
trade deficit in January to about $9.7 billion from $10.23 billion
in December.
   Investors also were awaiting reports later in the week on housing
sales, industrial production and wholesale prices to determine
whether the Federal Reserve's tight credit policy is working,
analysts said.
   Among blue chip issues, Philip Morris finished down ] at 118 ];
General Motors was down | at 84} and Union Carbide finished off | at
30{.
   Gainers included Coca Cola, up \ at 50\; Merck, up | at 66\; and

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market declined $2.07 billion, or 0.07
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.07 to 165.93.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index lost 0.26 to 340.95 and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index declined 0.18 at 295.14.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market was
off 0.55 to 406.01. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed down 0.01 at 330.53.

   The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee,
as an alternative to President Bush's proposal, suggested Tuesday
the government spend ``increments of $10 billion'' over the next few
months to close insolvent savings and loan institutions.
   Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich., asked congressional auditors to work up
numbers on the possible effects of putting the bulk of the
$100-billion-plus bailout of the S&amp;L industry on the fiscal 1989
budget instead of dragging it out over 30 years through the
elaborate off-budget financing scheme proposed by Bush.
   Riegle complained that the driving force behind Bush's proposal
was a desire to prevent the S&amp;L crisis from having an impact on the
annual deficit-reduction targets in the 1985 Gramm-Rudman law, which
requires a balanced federal budget by 1993.
   The Bush administration already has conceded that the government
will exceed the $136 billion target deficit for fiscal 1989, which
ends Sept. 30, by $35 billion.
   But the administration has been adamant in insisting that the
fiscal 1990 target defict of $100 billion be met, even if it's done
by stretching the taxpayer share of the S&amp;L bailout costs over 30
years at an estimated extra cost to them of $3 billion to $6 billion.
   ``This may be another way to work with the Gramm-Rudman
restraints and at the same time save the taxpayers an awfully lot of
money,'' Riegle said.
   It also would likely swell the projected fiscal 1989 deficit of
$170 billion _ which already is above the $155 billion deficit last
year _ back to the $200-billion-plus annual deficits of the mid
1980s as well as the total federal debt, which now exceeds $2.6
trillion.
   Riegle said his proposal, being pushed in the House by a member
of its banking committee, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., would
encourage the government to liquidate more insolvent S&amp;Ls
immediately rather than attempt to keep their doors open through
subsidized mergers.
   He described it as a ``cleaner'' and, in the long run, less
expensive, alternative. That view was expressed last week by William
S. Niskanean, a former economic adviser to then-President Reagan.
   ``Then we wouldn't be forced to make these mergers, which are
very expensive,'' Riegle said.
   That view was bolstered Tuesday by the congressional General
Accounting Office, which said it would have been cheaper in a third
of the government's 1988 spree of S&amp;L sales to have shut the
institutions and pay off depositors rather than sell the thrifts to
new owners.
   Last year government regulators spent about $37 billion closing,
selling or shoring up 222 insolvent thrifts _ $28.4 billion of it on
subisidies to the new owners of 179 of the them.
   Comptroller General and GAO chief Charles A. Bowsher told the
Senate Banking Committee that the the cash cost of those deals,
including some $7 billion to $8 billion in tax breaks, will total at
least $62 billion over the next few years and could go higher if
their condition worsens.
   ``Most of these (assistance) contracts are for up to 10 years,''
he said. ``That's what worries everyone.''
   In nine of 12 government-subsidized mergers that the GAO examined
in detail, the new owners will be able to use the guarantees against
losses and tax breaks to recoup the money they invested in an
average of three years, Bowsher said.
   While generally endorsing Bush's S&amp;L plan, Bowsher said it
represents the first time that the government would be making and
``open-ended'' commitment of funds with no cap on what eventually
might have to be spent. Some experts have put that amount in excess
of $200 billion over the next 10 years.
   Republicans defended the handling of last year's S&amp;L sales by the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board and its chairman, M. Danny Wall, who
would retain his post in the Bush plan.

<HEAD>Four Executives Offer To Buy Lincoln Savings and Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of American Continental Corp. executives,
including a former congressman from California, has offered to buy
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, one of the nation's largest
thrifts.
   Lincoln, a 29-branch, Irvine, Calif.-based thrift which lost
about $36 million in the first nine months of 1988, is the principal
subsidiary of American Continental.
   Under two purchase plans, the Phoenix developer would sell
Lincoln but buy back a resort and a hotel here, plus Lincoln's 20
percent interest in General Oriental Investments Ltd., a
London-based holding company.
   Former Rep. John Rousselot, R-Calif., hired last summer to find a
buyer for Lincoln, and three other American Continental executives
form the new group of would-be investors.
   Rousselot said he met Monday with the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board in Washington to discuss the offer of about $289 million, made
Friday.
   The Rousselot group's offer is the third made for the $6 billion
thrift in a year, leading to industry speculation that American
Continental was trying to buy time with federal regulators critical
of Lincoln's risky investments in high-yield bonds and undeveloped
property.
   ``If you can say to the regulators, `We're doing something or
trying to sell the institution,' that gives you a reason to stall
all regulatory action,'' said Bert Ely, a thrift analyst in
Alexandria, Va.
   Rousselot denied the allegation, saying Charles Keating, American
Continental's chairman, is ready to sell.
   ``He wants out of the savings and loan business, like today if we
could arrange it,'' Rousselot said.
   He said his group's offer was definitive and could close by the
end of the month.
   Other partners are American Continental lawyers Ronald Stoll and
David Thompson and Jack Atchison, former partner in an accounting
firm who joined the company last spring as a vice president.

<TEXT>
   Holly Farms Corp. will hold a shareholders'
meeting April 14 to consider ConAgra Inc.'s offer to buy the rival
poultry processor in a $1 billion stock swap.
   Approval of the ConAgra bid would block attempts by another
poultry company, Tyson Foods Inc., of Springdale, Ark., to take over
Holly Farms for $1.1 billion. Tyson has offered Holly Farms
shareholders $60 a share in cash and pledged to pay $63.50 a share
if Holly Farms management cooperates with a buyout.
   Holly Farms set its shareholders' meeting for 10 a.m. CST at the
Marriott Hotel here.
   However, Tyson has asked a state court in Delaware _ where Holly
Farms is incorporated _ to bar the meeting. Tyson also asked the
court to nullify the ConAgra-Holly Farms deal or to hold a hearing
on the appropriateness of the proposal, which provides for ConAgra
to buy certain Holly Farms assets even if their merger falls through.
   Jim Blair, a lawyer for Tyson, declined comment Tuesday on Holly
Farm's announcement.
   Tyson has been trying since last October to buy Holly Farms.
Doing so would allow Tyson to maintain its standing as the largest
poultry processor in the country.
   The proposed ConAgra-Holly Farms merger calls of a swap of 1.875
to 2 shares of ConAgra stock for each of Holly Farms' 18.1 million
outstanding shares.
   Based on expected market prices, the ConAgra bid amounts to about
$59 a share for Holly Farms stock, said Napoleon Overton, an analyst
with Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. of Memphis.
   ``It's still my opinion that Tyson will probably end up with
Holly Farms because they have an all-cash offer and they're willing
to pay more than ConAgra has so far offered,'' Overton said.
   Throughout Tyson's takeover attempt, ConAgra has declined to
discuss any increase in its bid, but Overton said an increase still
is possible.
   ``If they go to court and the judge determines that Holly Farms
is not bound by the terms of that merger agreement and the
asset-option lockup is invalid, then and only then would ConAgra
have any incentive to raise its current bid,'' he said.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Gain Again Amid Reports Saudis Cut Supplies to Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures gained for the second straight session Tuesday
after reports that one major oil producer, Saudi Arabia, cut
supplies to the Japanese by 30 percent, and another, Qatar, had
halted production of 150,000 barrels a day while performing
maintenance on its facilities.
   On other markets, silver rose strongly; cocoa prices climbed amid
concerns a labor stoppage in Brazil could affect supplies; and grain
and soybean prices were mixed.
   Crude oil futures settled 14 cents lower to 26 cents higher on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for delivery in
April at $19.29. Heationg oil was .01 cent to .34 cent higher, with
April at 52.40 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .10 cent to
.63 cent higher, with April at 53.50 cents a gallon.
   The 26-cent climb in the spot month followed a 53-cent jump
Monday that left crude oil prices at a 16-month high.
   ``The market was up on a confluence of factors,'' said Nauman
Barakat, vice president for energy investments at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., New York. ``But very important was the Saudis
cutting back the Japanese.
   ``The 30 percent was significantly larger than the Japanese
anticipated and about twice the cuts they absorbed in the first
quarter,'' he added.
   Barakat and other analysts pointed to indications that worldwide
supplies were tightening; confirmation Monday that non-OPEC
producers would go ahead with unilateral cuts of almost 300,000
barrels a day; better compliance with assigned quotas some OPEC
producers, notably the Saudis; and a temporary shutdown of some
facilities in Qatar.
   Additionally, a weekly estimate by the American Petroleum
Institute issued after the close of business Tuesday showed a
reduction in stocks from the previous weeks.
   ``We've got both fundamental and technical support for an
uptrend,'' said Barakat.
   Some traders viewed the rise in oil prices as another piece in
the inflationary puzzle, and the precious metals benefited from that
support as well as concerns that recent political rumblings in South
Africa may eventually affect supplies of platinum.
   Platinum climbed $6.90 to $7.10 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, with March at $549.30 a troy ounce. Gold was $1.50 to
$1.90 higher at the Comex, with March at $396.20 a troy ounce; and
silver was 9.5 cents to 12.4 cents higher, with March at $6.176 a
troy ounce.
   ``Silver's made the best bounce off the recent lows, but it's
still quite cheap relative to the other metals and it's drawing most
of the speculative interest,'' said Steve Chronowitz, director of
futures research for Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co., New York.
   But another analyst called the trend worrisome.
   ``If silver is taking the lead ... we could see trouble because
there are already considerable supplies,'' said Rich Levine, a
precious metals analyst at Elders Futures Inc., New York. ``Gold and
platinum already seem to be losing energy at these prices and if
silver breaks _ and my hunch is it will _ it could mean we've seen a
top for gold and platinum as well.''
   Cocoa prices rallied sharply as a widespread strike by Brazil's
labor unions affected shipments out of South America, as well as
news that sometimes-quarrelsome cocoa producers were making progress
in talks aimed at establishing supply levels.
   Volume was on light on the Chicago Board of Trade and the absence
of fresh news left the grain and soybean markets trading in very
narrow ranges.
   An early bout of profit-taking pressured wheat at the opening
bell and it never recovered, despite several recent sessions of
rising prices prompted by the unusually dry weather recently in the
Plains.
   Wheat was 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in March at $4.36{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 1\
cents higher, with March at $2.78\; oats were \ cent lower to { cent
higher, with March at $2.09{ a bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent
lower to 1{ cents higher, with March at $7.69.
   Livestock futures were mostly lower and prok future mixed at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent to .70 cent lower, with April at 77.42
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent lower to .05 cent higher,
with March at 81.15 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent lower to .13
cent higher, with April at 43.75 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .20 cent lower to .22 cent higher, with March at 38.25
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Narrows With Surge in Merchandise Exports</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs last graf to CORRECT foreign aid figure to $13.58 billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deficit in the broadest measure of American
trade improved dramatically last year, narrowing to $135.3 billion,
as a surge in merchandise exports was enough to offset a sharp
worsening in the U.S. investment balance sheet, the government said
Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said that the deficit in the current
account shrank 12.1 percent in 1988 after hitting an all-time high
of $153.96 billion in 1987.
   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only
trade in merchandise but also transactions in investments and other
services.
   For 1988, the improvement came entirely from a 21.1 percent
decline in the merchandise trade deficit, which fell to $126.5
billion as a 28 percent jump in U.S. exports sales outpaced a 9
percent rise in merchandise imports.
   But in what many private economists called an ominous
development, the nation's surplus in the investment category shrank
by 76 percent last year to a tiny $4.78 billion, down from $19.76
billion in 1987.
   Analysts said this reflected the growing ownership by foreigners
of U.S. government and corporate securities, bank deposits,
factories and land. As these holdings increase, the amount of money
foreigners earn on their U.S. investments grows as well.
   ``Interest on our foreign debt is rising dramatically and the
burden of financing this debt is increasing,'' said Lawrence
Chimerine, president of the WEFA Group, a private forecasting firm
in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   As recently as 1981, the United States ran surpluses in its
current account as the nation's cushion in overseas investment
earnings was enough to offset merchandise trade deficits.
   But in 1985, the United States became a net debtor for the first
time in 71 years as the value of American investments overseas were
surpassed by the value of foreign holdings in the United States.
   The latest current account report showed the United States
increased its hold on the title as the world's largest debtor nation
with the imbalance between U.S. holdings and foreign holdings in
America probably topping $500 billion, up from $368 billion at the
end of 1987. The government will not make its official accounting of
the U.S. net debtor position until June.
   The Bush administration, like the Reagan administration, has
maintained that the rise in foreign investment has been beneficial
to America, providing the country with needed capital to build new
factories and increase productivity.
   However, many private economists worry that the growing foreign
debt load will eventually lower America's standard of living as more
and more U.S. wealth is transferred into the hands of foreigners.
   ``We are continuing to borrow money from foreigners and we have
to pay them for that privilege,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senior
economist at Merrill Lynch of New York.
   The new report showed that the current account deficit for the
October-December quarter declined by 2.1 percent to $31.9 billion,
compared with a revised $32.6 billion deficit in the third quarter.
   While it was the third consecutive quarterly decline, analysts
said they believed improvements in the U.S. trade deficit had
essentially stalled out with the deficit still at a very high level.
   Many predicted the deficit for 1989 would show little if any
improvement as Americans continue to buy imports at record rates.
The Commerce Department will provide the first look at 1989 trade on
Wednesday when it releases its monthly merchandise trade report for
January.
   The Bush administration has been taking a get-tough stance,
hoping to pry open more foreign markets to U.S. goods. Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher told a congressional hearing on Tuesday
that the administration wants to get the trade deficit below a $100
billion annual rate in the next two years.
   For the year as a whole, the $135.3 billion current account
deficit was the smallest since a $115.1 billion imbalance in 1985.
The current account last showed a surplus in 1981, when the country
took in $6.88 billion more from foreigners than it purchased from
them.
   In addition to the $126.5 billion deficit in merchandise trade
and the $4.78 billion surplus in the services category, the $135.3
billion current account deficit also reflected payments of $13.58
billion in foreign aid and pensions to Americans living overseas.

   The Air Line Pilots Association, easing the way
for 3,600 pilots honoring Machinist union picket lines at Eastern
Airlines, said Tuesday it will give its members nearly $9 million a
month in strike benefits.
   The pilots union also said its 41,000 members would not fly
planes or routes sold to other airlines by Eastern, which declared
bankruptcy last week, unless a comparable number of Eastern pilots
were also hired, and at full seniority. An industry group said such
an action would be illegal.
   John Bavis, head of the Eastern pilots group, said the strike
benefit _ $2,400 a month _ was designed to remove the company's
``last enticement'' to pilots who have refused to work until the
Machinists settle. Only 2 percent of unionized Eastern pilots have
crossed picket lines, he said.
   ``Despite management's claim, we haven't cracked, we haven't
given in,'' he said, estimating that the company was operating with
fewer than 200 pilots, many of whom he said have already worked the
maximum 100 hours a month allowed by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   ``This is a critical time for all airline pilots,'' said Henry
Duffy, the president of the pilots union. ``All 41,000 pilots will
reach deep into their pockets,'' kicking in an average of $300 a
month, ``to help the Eastern pilots who are reaching deep within
themselves to cope with the personal and professional risks of their
action.''
   Duffy said the union would also draw on its $37 million strike
fund to begin paying the strike benefit, which will give members
less than half their regular salaries.
   The pilots will also get interest-free loans of up to $2,000 to
cover paychecks for work performed before the strike but which
Eastern refused to issue after filing for bankruptcy.
   John Mazor, a union spokesman, said the union has given financial
support to pilots in previous walkouts but has never put together
such an extensive package of payments, loans and other action.
   Late next week, if the strike that began March 4 is still on, the
8,500 striking machinists will get upwards of $100 in benefits from
their union, the International Association of Machinists, said union
spokesman Bob Kalaski.
   The pilots union, in a meeting Monday of members representing 47
airlines, unanimously agreed to refuse to fly Eastern routes or
planes that might be sold to other airlines unless Eastern pilots
were hired to go along with the assets.
   Duffy said the pilots agreed to make their position known to
airlines that might negotiate with Eastern to buy its assets. The
union accuses Frank Lorenzo, head of Texas Air Corp., which owns
Eastern, of planning to dismantle Eastern and cash in on its assets.
   Mazor said a refusal by pilots to fly planes or routes purchased
from Eastern would not violate the union contracts with the carriers.
   But the Air Transport Association, which represents airlines,
said such a refusal would be an illegal ``contained strike'' under
the Railway Labor Act which governs airline disputes. Spokeswoman
Leslie Rowland said if pilots object to flying planes from Eastern,
they should file a grievance and continue to work until it is
settled.
   Eastern is running only a small fraction of its more than 1,000
daily flights. Officials have said they plan to scale down the
airline, possibly selling off such assets as planes and routes to
other carriers.
   A $365 million sale of the airline's profitable Northeast shuttle
operations to New York developer Donald Trump is awaiting approval
from the FAA and the federal bankruptcy court in New York. The
Transportation Department gave its approval earlier.
   An $85 million sale of eight Eastern airport gates at
Philadelphia and two Philadelphia-Canada routes to USAir is also
pending. USAir spokesman David Shipley said he would not speculate
on what effect the pilots' position might have on the sale, which
also would not take effect until several levels of government
approval are secured, including that of the bankruptcy court.
   Mazor acknowledged that a union directive last week to all
airlines' member pilots telling them to follow the most
time-consuming safe-flying procedures did not result in significant
airport delays.
   He said about 60 percent of pilots were following the procedures.
   The Air Transport Association had urged the pilots not to follow
the directive, which it characterized as a ``slowdown order.''

   Car and light truck sales were down by 14.8
percent in early March from the same period last year as U.S.-based
automakers continued their slow 1989 sales start, the companies said
Tuesday.
   Automakers said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of
31,090 during the March 1-10 period this year, compared with a daily
rate of 36,493 a year earlier.
   Car sales were down by 18.5 percent during the early March period
compared with last year and truck sales were down 8 percent. Each of
the Big Three reported declines in domestic car sales rates, with
Chrysler Corp. sales dropping 35.9 percent, Ford Motor Co. falling
21.4 percent and General Motors Corp. declining 13.4 percent.
   Analysts speculated that sales were dampened by comparison with
strong results in the year-earlier period and by rising interest
rates that may finally be slowing consumer spending.
   ``That has to cut into the family's disposable income and maybe
they're thinking maybe let the old buggy do longer,'' said analyst
Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. of New York.
   Interest rates have been rising in recent months, partly because
of a credit squeeze engineered by the Federal Reserve to slow
economic activity and thus curb inflation. The prime lending rate _
the bank lending rate used as a benchmark for many types of consumer
loans _ is 11.5 percent, compared with 8.5 percent a year earlier.
   Analysts said automakers were waiting for traditionally good
early spring buying to start. March and April sales traditionally
have reduced automakers' inventories, which are hovering around the
80-day level.
   According to Ward's Automotive Reports, the combined inventory
among the U.S.-based automakers is at its highest level in 19 months.
   Each of the Big Three recently boosted incentive offers in an
effort to stimulate sales and GM temporarily has halted production
at two plants to reduce inventory.
   For the year through March 10, car and light truck sales by the
U.S.-based makers were down 6.9 percent from last year's pace,
falling to a daily rate of 33,838 vehicles from 36,330 last year.
Car sales were down 9.7 percent and truck sales were down by 1.7
percent.
   Chrysler sold cars at a daily rate of 2,471 in early March this
year, down from the 3,852 daily rate in the year-earlier period.
Chrysler's car sales were down 21.4 percent on a year-to-year
comparison.
   Chrysler's light trucks sales were 8.5 percent lower for the
period and up 3.5 percent for the year.
   Ford said its car sales during early March fell to a daily rate
of 6,012 in 1989 from a 7,651 rate during the period last year. For
the year, Ford's car sales were 3.3 percent lower than last year's
rate.
   Ford truck sales were down 20.6 percent in early March from the
same period last year and were off 3.5 percent for the year to date.
   GM said its car sales dropped to a daily rate of 9,175 during the
March 1-10 period this year from the 10,597 rate in early March last
year. GM's car sales for the year ran 14.4 percent behind last
year's pace.
   Light truck sales by GM were up 5.6 percent during early March
and for the year the pace was 5.8 percent behind last year's sales
rate.

   Times Mirror Co. said Tuesday it will cease
publishing Sports inc. The Sports Business Weekly, citing a lack of
advertising in the 15-month old magazine.
   The magazine debuted in January 1988 and had a controlled
circulation of 25,000. The last issue will be the March 20 issue.
   Edward E. Johnson, chairman of Times Mirror Magazines, said
Sports inc. had been widely praised by industry leaders, but he
added, ``Unfortunately, this readership enthusiasm was not matched
by advertising support.''
   Some information that has appeared in the magazine now will be
used regularly in The Sporting News, another Times Mirror
publication, the company said in a release.
   ``While we are of course disappointed with this outcome, it
certainly does not lessen our commitment to the magazine field, in
which we have grown significantly in recent years,'' the company
said.
   Times Mirror also publishes such sports-oriented magazines as
Field &amp; Stream, Outdoor Life, Golf Magazine and Ski Magazine.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the higher seniority levels, U.S. airline
pilots earn salaries that make them an elite among unionized
employees.
   The nation's 60,000 or so commercial pilots earn an average of
$82,500 a year plus benefits and have starting salaries averaging
around $21,600, according to Future Aviation Professionals of
America in Atlanta.
   Salaries are determined mainly by seniority and the size of
aircraft flown. Pilots typically start out as flight engineers,
regulating fuel levels and performing other functions in the cockpit
but not actually flying planes. They progress to become copilots of
smaller aircraft, then co-pilots of bigger planes, followed by
captains of smaller planes and finally captains of larger craft.
   Under this system, widely used smaller aircraft include Boeing
727s and 737s, as well as DC9s and MD80s made by McDonnell Douglas
Corp. Bigger commercial planes include Boeing 747s and 767s,
McDonnell Douglas DC10s and Lockheed Corp.'s L1011-Tristar.
   Senior captains earn an average $133,000 a year, with the maximum
pay for that category reaching $167,000 plus substantial benefits,
according to FAPA, an aviation career information service.
   The 10,000 to 12,000 pilots who fly corporate jets, by contrast,
start at around $24,000 and earn an average $44,000 a year.
   Many pilots still get their training in the military, but others
attend special flight schools or professional schools.
   Piloting remains a predominantly white male profession. Only
about 1 percent of U.S. airline pilots are women, while fewer than 1
percent are minorities.
   The average age of U.S. pilots is in the range of 33 to 36 years
and average seniority is 15 years of service, according to Future
Aviation Professionals of America.

<TEXT>
   The government tightened security on the
handling of fruit exports Tuesday and began a criminal investigation
into the cyanide-tainting of grapes exported to the United States.
   In a nationally broadcast address, Interior Minister Carlos
Caceres vowed that Chile would remain ``a dependable fruit supplier
to the world.''
   He called the contamination a case of communist sabotage.
Communist Party spokesmen denied any involvement.
   The agriculture minister, Jaime de la Sotta, said he would fly to
Washington to discuss the situation with U.S. officials.
   De la Sotta said investigators had identified the packing house
and vineyard that was the source of the tainted grapes. He refused
to identify them.
   But the president of the exporters, Enrique Bruzzone, said the
tainted grapes came from a vineyard and packing house owned by Julia
Saavedra in the Curacavi area, just northwest of Santiago. He said
Ms. Saavedra is an established grower and exporter.
   Bruzzone said members of the exporters association voluntarily
suspended all packing and shipping operations for 72 hours Tuesdat
night to check all the fruit they had in storage. Grape picking was
also reported idled at most fields.
   Earlier, de la Sotta said the government might temporarily stop
all fruit operations and exports.
   Authorities in the United States, Canada and Japan ordered all
Chilean fruit removed from supermarkets and urged consumers not to
eat any fruit they had already purchased.
   Dutch officials said they were testing Chilean grapes, and
Italian officials said they planned to do the same. In West Germany,
the Health Ministry said tighter controls were put on incoming
Chilean produce.
   Authorities in the port of Valparaiso, 75 miles northwest of
Santiago, said loading of U.S.-bound grapes in one Chilean ship was
halted Tuesday.
   But two other ships, of Japanese registry, were being loaded with
600,000 crates to be sent to Philadelphia and Tampa, Fla.,
authorities saied.
   Fruit exporters and growers said the United States may have
overreacted in removing fruit from stores, but they also announced
plans to redouble security in the exporting process. Chemical tests
were increased.
   The U.S decision ``seems logical from the point of view of the
concern over the population's health,'' the exporters and growers
said. They added, however, that it was exaggerated considering the
``huge social and economic impact it has on our country.''
   Nearly 65 percent of Chile's fruit exports _ grapes, melons,
apples and peaches _ go to the United States.
   Export earnings this year had been expected to exceed $850
million, representing more than 10 percent of all export earnings.
Last year's export earnings totaled $581 million.
   De la Sotta said the cyanide found in two clusters of grapes in
Philadelphia on March 2 amounted to 0.52 parts per million. U.S.
officials said a child would have to eat 2,000 grapes to ingest a
fatal dose.
   ``We have increased security in order to ensure that all fruits
leaving our country is totally safe,'' De la Sotta said.
   Caceres said that security was being reinforced ``from the fields
to the port of destination.''
   The U.S. and Japanese embassies in Santiago received anonymous
telephone calls earlier this month saying fruit exports would be
poisoned. An investigation turned up nothing, authorities said.
   A Bush administration source knowledgeable about the
investigation said ``the first message did suggest they were trying
to call attention to the poverty in Chile.'' The source spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   After confirming cyanide in the Philadelphia samples, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration on Monday urged that the fruit be
removed from stores. The FDA said Tuesday that it had stepped up
tests on Chilean fruit.
   Chile is at the height of the harvesting season and De la Sotta
said it expected to export 102 million to 103 million crates this
season.
   He said about 47 million crates had been shipped. Another 17
milliom are in warehouses awaiting shipment or en route to various
countries.
   Adm. Jose Merino, navy commander and head of the law-making
military junta, blamed the United States, as well as the communists,
for the incident.
   ``This is yet another roguish act of the United States,'' said
Merino, a frequent critic of the United States. ``Americans think
were are all banana republics. Chile is not a banana republic.''
   Merino said Chile should seek alternative markets for its fruit.
   Chile has been under right-wing military rule since September
1973, when the armed forces ousted the elected government of Marxist
President Salvador Allende. The coup was led by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, the current president.

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. will become one of
US Sprint's largest customers under an agreement in which Sprint
will provide long-distance connections between about 20,000 Sears
locations nationwide, Sprint said Tuesday.
   Specific terms of the contract were not disclosed, but Sprint
described it as a ``multimillion-dollar communications services''
agreement that ``significantly extends and enhances an agreement
previously reached between Sears and US Sprint in 1988 and makes
(Sears) one of US Sprint's largest users.''
   ``Most US Sprint products and services are covered under the
agreement,'' the company said.
   Selby Shaver, senior vice president of data center operations and
voice telecommunications for Sears Technology Services, said US
Sprint will carry most of Sears' long-distance traffic.
   US Sprint President William Esrey called the agreement ``a
significant milestone in US Sprint history.''
   ``We consider the Sears account to be a strong endorsement of our
company,'' Esrey said.
   US Sprint, based in Kansas City, Mo., provides long-distance
domestic and international voice, data and video-conferencing
services and products. Some of its major customers include General
Electric Co., Westinghouse Electric Corp. and Nynex Corp.
   Sprint's long-distance revenues in 1988 totaled $3.4 billion, up
27 percent from $2.67 billion in 1987. But it had an operating loss
of $409 million for the year, in part due to a $195 million charge
for a restructuring.
   Sprint is a joint venture between United Telecommunications Inc.
of Kansas City, Mo., and GTE Corp., with United Telecommunications
holding the controlling share.
   Sears Technology Services is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Chicago-based Sears, whose businesses include the Sears Merchandise
Group, Allstate Insurance Co., Coldwell Banker and the Dean Witter
Financial Services Group.

<TEXT>
   A stockbroker was convicted of fraud and perjury
charges Tuesday for a $250,000 scheme to buy Waldbaum Inc. stock
with inside information that A&amp;P was going to buy the supermarket
chain.
   Chestman, a stockbroker and first vice president of Gruntal &amp;
Co., was convicted on all counts by a federal court jury in its
second day of deliberations.
   He was charged with buying 11,000 shares of Waldbaum on Nov. 26,
1986, just before the public announcement of the sale to A&amp;P and
just after being told about the deal by one of his clients, a
relative by marriage of Waldbaum's president, Ira Waldbaum.
   Chestman also was charged with lying to the Securities and
Exchange Commission about receiving inside information from the
client, Keith Loeb.
   Loeb, who testified for the government in a plea bargain through
which he avoided criminal prosecution, paid about $50,000 in fines
and disgorged profits to settle an SEC civil action.
   Chestman, 41, of the Long Island community of Lawrence, faces a
maximum penalty of five years in prison on each of the 31 counts of
which he was convicted: 20 counts of securities fraud, 10 counts of
mail fraud and one count of perjury.
   He also faces a maximum fine of about $500,000 _ twice his
illegal profits _ when he is sentenced April 25 by U.S. District
Judge John M. Walker Jr.
   Chestman, who is on unpaid leave from Gruntal, remains free on
bail.

   Hertz Corp. agreed to pay $72,980 in civil
penalties and costs Tuesday to settle a lawsuit filed by the
district attorney's office after one of its prosecutors tried to
rent a car at a special rate and found it unavailable.
   Deputy District Attorney Steven Suzukawa launched the Consumer
Protection Division investigation after he telephoned Hertz in
October 1987 to inquire about low weekend rental rates he had seen
advertised in Sports Illustrated magazine, according to a summary of
the case issued by district attorney spokesman Al Albergate.
   Suzukawa was told that the special rates were not available in
California, although the ad failed to state that.
   Hertz revised its ad as soon as it was notified, Albergate said,
and cooperated in negotiating a settlement of the case. He said the
company also has been seeking ``clearer guidelines for advertising
pertaining to the car rental business.''
   The final settlement includes an injunction prohibiting Hertz
from advertising rates on cars when the rates are not generally
available and requiring Hertz to have a supply of advertised cars
sufficient to meet a reasonable demand.
