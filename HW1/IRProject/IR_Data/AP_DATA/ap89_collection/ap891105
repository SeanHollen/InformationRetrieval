<UNK>Reports Flight 103 Bomb Originated in Cyprus</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British newspaper claimed Sunday the bomb that
destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland began its deadly journey
in Cyprus in a suitcase loaded onto a Cyprus Air jet.
   The Sunday Correspondent, citing unidentified police sources,
reported investigators have largely discounted theories published
last week that the bomb was put on board an Air Malta flight on
Malta before being transferred to the Pan Am flight.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, taking on
passengers and luggage flown in from other areas on international
``feeder flights.''
   The passengers and bags were transferred at London's Heathrow
Airport to the New York-bound Boeing 747 that was ripped apart over
Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people on board
and 11 on the ground.
   The weekly said the bomb apparently was placed in one of several
suitcases that went aboard one of two feeder flights from Cyprus to
Frankfurt.
   It said at least four U.S. intelligence agents died on Flight
103 and they had boarded the feeder flights in Larnaca. Three of
the agents were reported to have been returning from an undercover
mission believed to be connected with the U.S. hostages in Lebanon,
it said.
   The Sunday Correspondent said investigators suspect that a
suitcase belonging to one of the agents was substituted at Larnaca
airport for the suitcase containing the bomb.
   Another British weekly, The Sunday Times, reported last week
that there was a Maltese connection in the bombing. It said the
baggage list showed one suitcase was transferred to Flight 103 by
an Air Malta plane that originated in Malta.
   The Sunday Times, quoting unidentified British sources, said the
bomb was placed in a suitcase that contained clothing made and
purchased in Malta.

   Police found the bodies of eight people in an
Andean village Saturday and blamed the slayings on leftist rebels.
Authorities said guerrillas also fatally shot a soccer player and a
teacher.
   Police reports said two high school girls were among the eight
victims whose bodies were found in a vacant lot near the main plaza
in the village of Pucara, 140 miles east of Lima. They said all of
the victims were shot several times in the head and the killings
were carried out by guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path group.
   In Huancayo, four miles from Pucara, rebels killed one soccer
club member and wounded two others after the players defied a rebel
strike call and played in a soccer match Friday, police reported.
   They said a group of guerrillas entered the team's dressing room
after the game and ordered the players to gather on the playing
field. The gunmen criticized the players for holding a game on the
day of an ``armed strike'' called by the Shining Path and shot the
three players when they tried to leave, according to police.
   An ``armed strike'' implies the threat of violence to anyone who
leaves their home.
   In Acobamba, 95 miles northeast of Lima, a teacher was killed
Friday by rebels after a brief ``people's trial'' in the village
square, police said. They said the killers seized the teacher who
was staying at the home of the town's mayor when they broke into
the house looking for the mayor.
   The Shining Path has called strikes and assassinated more than
120 mayors, candidates and local officials in a campaign to disrupt
municipal elections set for Nov. 12. Hundreds of candidates have
quit out of fear.
   On Friday, more than 10,000 people defied the Shining Path's
strike call and attended a peace march in Lima calling for an end
to the political violence.
   The Maoist guerrillas launched their insurgency in 1980. The
government says more than 15,000 people have been killed in
guerrilla-related violence.

   Thrill seekers lined up Saturday to
ride the Giant Dipper roller coaster for the first time since last
month's earthquake and declared it tame compared to what they
survived.
   ``At least you always know what's going to happen with the Giant
Dipper. You come back to where you started and you can get back on
if you want,'' said Diane Rossi. ``With an earthquake, you just
don't know.''
   Mrs. Rossi and her 8-year-old daughter, Teresa, were among about
1,000 people who visited the city's boardwalk amusement park for a
benefit for victims of the earthquake that struck the San Francisco
Bay area Oct. 17.
   The quake, centered north of this seaside community, measured
7.1 on the Richter scale, killed at least 66 people and did at
least $7 billion in property damage.
   The 1924-vintage roller coaster on white wooden trestles, which
is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was
untouched by the quake, as were most of the other rides along the
boardwalk, including a carousel built in 1911 that also is on the
register.
   Visitors paid $5 for unlimited rides on the amusement park's
first open day since the quake, and proceeds will go to earthquake
relief, said Ann Parker, spokeswoman for the Santa Cruz Seaside
Co., the owner of the park.
   ``A lot of people in this community are still putting their
lives together,'' Ms. Parker said. ``We're hoping that some of
those people come out here, even for a half hour, and have a little
fun.''
   Bob Hinde of neighboring Scotts Valley and his sons, Josh, 10,
and Jason, 15, ran from the exit to the entrance of the Giant
Dipper, riding it again and again. They said they wouldn't be
surprised if they managed at least 20 rides before the afternoon
was over.
   ``This was the first ride we went on when we got here,'' Hinde
said. ``I came up here after the quake and checked it to see if it
was all right. It looked like it was. Now I know it is.''

<HEAD>China Adds Restriction On Students Seeking To Go Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students wanting to study abroad who must first
take an English-language proficiency test will have to provide a
letter of permission from their department, Chinese sources said
Sunday.
   It is an additional government measure to tighten controls over
overseas study programs. Limitations were adopted after the army
crushed student-led pro-democracy demostrations last June.
   An official of the State Education Commission confirmed that a
rule demanding such a letter of authorization recently went into
effect. He did not elaborate.
   The sources said non-students must have a letter from their work
unit or, if unemployed, from their neighborhood committee if they
want to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).
   The sources said at least one Beijing student had his request
for a letter rejected by his department because he was on a
``problem list'' of students involved in some way in the spring
demonstrations.
   So many students want to take the TOEFL that some must hold
places in line for up to a week just to register.
   The test, required by most universities in the United States and
other English-speaking countries that accept foreign students, is
usually given three times a year in Beijing. Students are now
registering for a January examination.
   The government also requires a registration fee of $29, the
equivalent of a month's salary for most workers.
   Government officials have claimed there is no change in the
policy of sending students and academics abroad, but some spoke of
``necessary adjustments'' after the June crackdown.
   Most government scholarships now are going to older research
students and scholars applying for short-term programs. It is
virtually impossible for undergraduates to gain permission for
overseas studies.
   Premier Li Peng said in September that those being sent abroad
should be mainly visiting scholars and researchers because they are
older and more mature politically.
   The government is also said to be shifting foreign study
destinations away from the West and toward socialist countries.
   About half the 80,000 Chinese studying abroad now are in the
United States. Many in the West have been outspoken in criticizing
the government for the crackdown on dissent.
   The number of students refusing to return to China is expected
to increase.
   Last week the government moved to extend its monitoring of
self-supporting students abroad _ the least likely to return to
China _ by announcing that such students must register at the
Chinese Embassy or consulate within the next six months.

   Certifying exams for at least 2,000 emergency room doctors
across the country have been postponed because of threats to the
physicians and to those who were to give the test, authorities said.
   Doctors who were to travel to eight cities for the tests Sunday
and Monday were notified there would be no exam, the American Board
of Medical Specialties announced from its headquarters in East
Lansing, Mich. A date for a re-test hasn't been set.
   The organization, as well as participants and the FBI, said
threatening letters were mailed to participants.
   ``This decision was based on the possibility of harm to
individuals related to the examinations and concerns for security
at all examination sites,'' the board said in a news release Friday.
   The exams _ for doctors who have finished specialty training in
emergency medicine _ were scheduled in Arlington, Va.; Atlanta;
Chicago; Dallas; Dearborn, Mich.; Los Angeles; Philadelphia; and
San Francisco.
   The FBI has begun an investigation, said Joseph Valiquette, a
spokesman for the bureau's New York office.
   ``It's just weird that a threat would be made at this kind of
thing,'' said John Bogdan, of the FBI's New York office. ``It would
be synonymous with threatening to do something at an SAT exam.''
   One of those threatened, Rebecca Martin, a Waterloo, Iowa,
physician who had planned to take the test in Chicago, said she was
shocked by the letter and disappointed because she'd spent months
preparing for the exam.
   ``When I opened the letter I thought it was a hoax,'' Ms. Martin
said. ``Have I been studying for the test? That's probably the
understatement of the year.''
   This is the first time a medical specialty examination has had
to be canceled, said Dr. Don Langsley, director of the American
Board of Medical Specialties, which oversees the 23 specialty
boards in the United States.

   An armed escapee from a Massachusetts

after police got a tip inspired by a TV crime show.
   Christopher Rambert, 23, was arrested by police and FBI agents
at a motel in West Covina, about 20 miles east of downtown Los
Angeles, police said. A woman who was with him voluntarily was
released later.
   Police also recovered a semiautomatic pistol and a car reported
stolen in Georgia.
   A recent feature about Rambert on the Fox television show
``America's Most Wanted'' led to a tip that he was at the motel,
police said.
   Rambert was taken to a police station, where he agreed to put on
a T-shirt with the ``America's Most Wanted'' logo for his booking
photograph, police said. He was to be transferred to Los Angeles
County Jail to await extradition.
   Rambert escaped Oct. 1 from the center at a Bridgewater, Mass.,
prison, where he was serving a life sentence for multiple rapes and
other violent crimes, officers said.

   Dr. Howard A. Rusk, who pioneered rehabilitation
techniques for the physically disabled, died Saturday of a stroke.
He was 88.
   Rusk died in a nursing home where he had been for three months.
   Rusk developed rehabilitation techniques for airmen injured in
World War II and his methods became standard medical practice
throughout the world.
   He proposed some of the techniques in a weekly column he wrote
for The New York Times from 1946-1969.
   Rusk was born April 9, 1901, in Brookfield, Mo. He earned his
medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in just two
years instead of the usual four.
   From 1926 to 1942, he was an internal medicine specialist in St.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks between the Machinists union and the Boeing
Co. broke off Saturday with a union official calling the aerospace
giant's offer to end the month-old strike and restart production an
``insult.''
   Mediator Douglas Hammond said he decided to end the latest round
of talks Saturday afternoon, but he refused to say what had
happened. No further talks were scheduled after sixth straight days
of face-to-face meetings, he said.
   Hammond said both sides had worked hard to reach an agreement,
but ultimately they ``continued to agree to disagree.''
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said the company's latest offer
included bigger annual bonuses and reduced cost-of-living payments,
leaving the value of the overall package essentially the same as
the offer the union rejected overwhelmingly on Oct. 3.
   The latest offer also included a further cut in mandatory
overtime, a key issue in the strike, Binder said.
   Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751, blasted
the offer after emerging from the 2{-hour session.
   ``This seems to me to really be an insult to us to bring us down
here for six days, bringing the hopes of our membership up,'' he
said.
   Larry McKean, Boeing's chief negotiator, said the company had
made a ``great offer.''
   ``I believe the union leadership should act reasonably and take
the offer to their members for a vote,'' he said.
   But union spokesman Jack Daniels said leadership won't present
the offer for a vote.
   ``It's not an improvement on the offer of Oct. 3 _ and they
rejected that,'' Daniels said.
   Both sides agreed before the day's session began that the talks
had reached a critical stage. Baker said they had ``discussed the
issues about all we can. Now I think it's time for some action.''
   Hammond got the talks started after meeting separately with both
sides last Sunday.
   The strike began Oct. 4 after nearly 58,000 members of the
International Association of Machinists rejected a three-year offer
with pay raises of 4 percent in the first year and 3 percent in the
second and third years, as well as bonuses of 8 percent and 3
percent in the first two years.
   Boeing's offer also included cost-of-living increases to
virtually cover inflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime from
200 to 160 hours per quarter and higher benefits.
   Binder said the company's latest offer included unchanged wage
increases and bonuses of 10 percent the first year and 4 percent in
the second and third years. Mandatory overtime would be cut to 144
hours a quarter by the middle of 1990 and employees would not be
required to work more than two consecutive weekends, he said.
   The Machinists represent 43,300 Boeing workers in the Seattle
area, covered by District 751 lodge; 12,000 in Wichita, Kan.; 1,700
in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred at scattered sites in
California, Hawaii, Utah, Montana, Wyoming and other states.
   The second-largest union at Boeing also is in negotiations. The
contract for about 28,000 engineers and technical workers who
belong to the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association expires Dec. 1.
   Both sides say a strike is unlikely. That union's lawyer Dan
Mahoney said Friday that daily talks would begin Monday and he
hoped to have an offer ready for a membership vote by Nov. 15.

   An underwater and aerial search for 97
crewmen of a capsized U.S. oil-drilling ship resumed early Sunday
after divers worked late into the night but found no survivors,
company officials said.
   The boat overturned in the Gulf of Thailand during the country's
worst typhoon in more than three decades.
   ``We have no reports of survivors,'' said a press release Sunday
from the company, Unocal Thailand, a subsidiary of the Los
Angeles-based ship owner Unocal.
   A helicopter spotted the upside-down hull of the 351-foot
Seacrest on Saturday, but a search covering 600 square miles in the
Gulf of Thailand failed to find survivors, lifeboats or debris from
the vessel.
   The Seacrest, with members of 13 nationalities aboard _
including seven Americans _ overturned earlier Saturday as Typhoon
Gay blasted the gulf with 100 mph winds. At least a dozen fishing
boats and two cargo vessels capsized in the storm, local news
reports said.
   Unocal lost contact with the vessel about 12 hours after the
storm began whipping up Thursday.
   By Saturday afternoon, four Unocal rescue ships and a helicopter
had reached the area of the stricken vessel, said Carol Scott, a
company spokeswoman in Bangkok. Ships and aircraft of the Thai navy
and air force joined the search.
   The vessel was about three miles northwest of the Platong oil
processing platform. The Platong field is 270 miles south of
Bangkok.
   A helicopter dropped a two-man search and rescue team atop the
hull.
   ``They tapped on the part of the hull that is above water,
listening for a signal back, but got no response,'' Scott said.
   Initially, rescue workers had to battle six-foot waves and 20 to
35 mph wind, she said.
   Thai navy divers continued diving operations around the Seacrest
using lights and remotely operated underwater vehicles.
   Earlier, one of the Unocal search craft rescued six Thai
fishermen who were clinging to their upturned boat without
lifejackets after a separate accident, Scott said.
   A drilling rig reaching 60 feet or higher was mounted in the
center of the Seacrest and the vessel was stacked with drilling
equipment, said Barry Lane, a Unocal spokesman in Los Angeles.
There was concern the ship might have been too top-heavy to weather
the storm. Also, the crew had little time to prepare.
   ``This actually was a small storm, a squall, and it escalated
very quickly into a tropical storm, and then a typhoon,'' he said.
   The official Radio Thailand quoted meteorological officials as
saying the typhoon was the worst to hit Thailand in 35 years.
   The Seacrest is owned by a Unocal subsidiary and operated by
Great Eastern Drilling and Engineering Co., Lane said. Of the 97 on
board, there were 64 Thais, seven Americans, five Britons, four
Australians, three Filipinos, three Singaporeans, two Malaysians,
two Indonesians, two Canadians, two Danes, one West German, one New
Zealander and one Norwegian.

<HEAD>FBI Agrees to Purge Records of Central American Protest Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI says it will purge its files of
thousands of names of people and organizations collected during its
controversial investigation of Americans who protested U.S. policy
in Central America.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions disclosed the plan to transfer
records of the bureau's 1983-85 investigation of the Coalition in
Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES) to the National
Archives and Records Administration in letter to Congress released
last week.
   Sessions' decision was hailed as a victory for CISPES by the
Center for Constitutional Rights, which had represented the group
in a lawsuit that obtained documents disclosing the domestic spying
operation.
   In a separate case, The National Security Archive, a private
not-for-profit group, said Saturday that a new batch of FBI
documents it received last week showed the agency ran background
checks on people whose names surfaced during its ``Library
Awareness Program.''
   The FBI memo said the checks, conducted after the library
program was already under public attack, were ``to determine
whether a Soviet active measures campaign had been initiated to
discredit'' the controversial operation.
   The FBI ran background checks on the more than 250 U.S. citizens
who protested the surveillance program to learn whether the
protesters were backed by Soviet intelligence services, the Los
Angeles Times reported in its Sunday editions.
   Beginning in the 1960s, the FBI had asked librarians to watch
for ``suspicious'' users and report them for fear that Soviet bloc
agents were combing the stacks for valuable technical data, the
Times said, citing FBI documents released Saturday.
   In 1987, angry librarians and others protested, prompting the
FBI to run background checks ``to determine whether a Soviet
campaign had been initiated to discredit the Library Awareness
Program,'' according to one FBI memo.
   A memo said all but eight of the 266 checks ``were either
negative or of no significance to this study.'' The names of the
eight individuals who did not fit the ``negative or of no
significance'' category were blacked out in the once-secret memo
made public.
   The memo, showing that the agency was looking into the origin of
the criticism of its library program even while it was under media
attack, was among more than 1,200 pages of documents turned over to
the private archive group as part of a stipulation reached earlier
this year in a federal court proceeding. Two other large batches
had been turned over to the private group previously.
   In the case involving Central American protesters, Sessions
conceded last year that the FBI overstepped its bounds by
conducting domestic surveillance of political groups allied with
CISPES.
   Six supervisory-level agents were disciplined and the Senate
intelligence committee sharply criticized the investigation, which
took place under former FBI Director William Webster, now head of
the CIA.
   ``Clearly we see this as a major cave-in by the FBI and a real
important victory in the fight against surveillance,'' said Michael
Ratner, an attorney at the New York-based center.
   ``It's a big victory for the FBI to finally concede they have no
business snooping in these files, that they belong in the National
Archives under very secure protection,'' said Ratner.
   CISPES also sued the FBI to force it to remove the names of
innocent people from case files by transferring the records to the
Archives. The group is appealing a federal judge's dismissal of the
lawsuit.
   Sessions disclosed his decision in an Oct. 27 letter to Rep. Don
Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
civil and constitutional rights.
   ``Transferal of the records to the Archives will protect the
thousands of innocent individuals whose names appear in these files
even though they were not even suspected of anything illegal,''
Edwards, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and
constitutional rights, said in a statement Friday.
   ``This will ensure that the files will not damage someone in a
future background investigation,'' Edwards said.
   FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich said the bureau has not settled on
the terms of the records transfer.
   It will take place ``after we are satisfied that the
confidential relationships that the FBI had with citizens who chose
to assist us in those investigations will be preserved,'' he said.
   In his letter to Edwards, Sessions said any agreement negotiated
with the Archives would enable the FBI to continue to use the
CISPES files in pending litigation.
   Ratner said he would have no objection to that condition.
   ``That would be fine if it can only be used for litigation
purposes. That would be acceptable assuming they protect the whole
range of people who have been surveilled,'' Ratner said.
   The CISPES surveillance and infiltration that was conducted
between 1983 and 1985 was based on tips to the FBI that individuals
affiliated with the groups were linked with international terrorist
organizations.
   The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, in a sharply
critical report last summer, concluded that the investigation was
based on ``allegations that should not have been considered
credible.''
   Sessions' letter to Edwards indicated that his decision to
transfer the records to the National Archives was in part
influenced by recommendations from various congressional committees
that the FBI files be purged of the material.
   According to the Senate intelligence committee report, the
CISPES investigation resulted in the names of 2,375 individuals and
1,330 groups being placed in the FBI's central investigative index
for easy retrieval.
   The report found that the investigation had produced a total of
650 volumes of investigative files containing a total of 24,000
names of people and organizations, most of which were not indexed.
   In congressional testimony last year, Sessions admitted that the
investigation ``caused information on rank-and-file members who had
nothing to do with international terrorism to be included in FBI
case files.''
   The FBI had previously purged its case files of material from a
broad surveillance and infiltration of the Socialist Workers Party
from the late 1950s to the early 1970s.

Oct. 17 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area Sunday morning.
   Pat Jorgenson, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Geological Survey,
said the aftershock hit at 5:37 a.m. and measured 4.0 on the
Richter scale, according to a preliminary calculation. The
seismographic station at the University of California at Berkeley
estimated the strength at 4.2 on the scale.
   The quake occurred on the San Andreas fault and the epicenter
was in Loma Prieta, located about 8 miles northeast of Santa Cruz,
Ms. Jorgenson said.
   That is the same fault and epicenter of the Oct. 17 earthquake,
which measured 7.1 on the Richer scale, and claimed 66 lives and
billions of dollars in damage.
   There were no reports of damage or injuries. A 4.0 Richter quake
is capable of moderate damage near the center.

   Lebanese lawmakers elected Parliament
member Rene Mouawad as the country's president on Sunday and
approved a peace accord, defying a threat of attack by the leader
the nation's Christian forces.
   Mouawad, a 22-year veteran of Lebanese politics and a Maronite
Catholic, was elected president at a special Parliament session
that convened in Syrian-policed north Lebanon.
   The session got under way Sunday afternoon with 57 legislators
attending, eight more than the needed quorum of 49.
   The legislators re-elected house speaker Hussein Husseini, a
Shiite Moslem who has held the post since 1984, for a one-year
term. They also unanimously ratified a peace accord that was
brokered by the Arab League at a special Parliament meeting last
month in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   The accord is aimed at ending a 14-year civil war that has torn
apart this country.
   The lawmakers met outside the range of the guns of Christian
army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, who threatened to shell Parliament
when it initially planned to meet in Beirut on Saturday to ratify
the accord.
   The peace plan shifts political power to the Moslem majority
from the Christians, who were believed to be in the majority when
the existing political system was devised in the 1940s. Aoun
opposes the accord because it has no fixed schedule for a total
withdrawal of the estimated 40,000 Syrian troops backing Moslem
forces.
   Husseini flew into Kleiat from Paris with 29 mostly Christian
deputies who had been staying in the French capital to avoid Aoun's
wrath. They linked up with 26 mostly Moslem legislators who drove
Saturday from Beirut, 60 miles to the south, and a 27th who flew in
from Geneva Sunday.
   The country has not had a head of state since President Amin
Gemayel's 6-year term expired Sept. 22, 1988, because Parliament
could not agree on a successor.
   Aoun, who heads an interim military Cabinet vying for power with
a rival Syrian-backed Moslem government led by Salim Hoss, branded
the legislators approval of the peace accord last month in the
Saudi Arabian resort of Taif ``a breach of the constitution.''
   The general considers the Syrians, who control 70 percent of
Lebanon, an occupying army and fought them for six months until a
Sept. 22 cease-fire called by the Arab League took hold.
   By police count, 930 people were killed and 2,744 wounded, most
of them civilians, in fierce artillery battles.
   The Taif accord increased the size of Parliament from the
current 99 seats _54 Christian and 45 Moslem _ to 108, to be evenly
distributed between both sides, and stripped the president of the
authority to appoint and dismiss prime ministers.
   But the agreement left the presidency with the Maronites, the
dominant Christian sect, as it has been under an unwritten covenant
dating from independence from France in 1943.

   Pope John Paul II on Sunday urged decisive
action to combat the ``merchants of death'' who control the drug
trade.
   The pontiff called the fight against drugs ``one of the great
challenges which human kind is called upon to meet today.''
   ``It is necessary to respond to the challenge of drugs in a
decisive manner,'' he said. ``There is a need to identify and
dismantle the interests of the `merchants of death' who speculate
on the suffering of millions of people.
   ``Then there is a need to achieve a wide-ranging prevention that
centers on the promotion of responsibility, solidarity, respect,
teaching truth, good and justice,'' he said in his noon ``Angelus''
address from his window overlooking St. Peter's Square.
   The pope expressed his appreciation for the work of drug
rehabilitation clinics, saying they were committed ``not only to
the recovery of so many lives, but also to spreading a culture of
hope against death.''

<TEXT>
   The country's largest
newspaper said Sunday that the autobiography of jailed black leader
Nelson Mandela will be published early next year, possibly to
coincide with his expected release.
   The Sunday Times said the book was secretly written by the
African National Congress leader during his 27 years in prison and
the manuscript has been smuggled out.
   Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, is believed to be negotiating
with American and British publishers, and bidding for rights to the
book has reached $3 million, said The Sunday Times.
   Mandela, South Africa's best known black leader, has been
imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage
and plotting to overthrow the white-led government.
   Seven of Mandela's colleagues were freed from prison Oct. 15 in
what was widely seen as a trial run for his release.
   The government says it is considering freeing Mandela but has
refused to divulge details about the timing. Most of the
speculation in the South African press suggests he will be released
early next year.
   The Sunday Times quoted an unidentified publishing source in
London as saying Mandela's autobiography will appear in bookstores
when he is released.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of supporters of Ferdinand
Marcos gathered in a Manila park on Sunday to denounce a police
crackdown on an earlier rally and to protest the ``hatred, greed
and terror'' of the government.
   About 1,500 followers of the late president held an
``indignation rally'' at Bonifacio park after troops used water
cannons and tear gas to break up a march by hundreds of Marcos
loyalists the day before.
   The protesters had gathered at national police headquarters late
Friday for an all-night rally, and police moved in after they
refused to disperse early Saturday.
   The rallies came as President Corazon Aquino left on an official
visit Saturday to the United States and Canada to drum up foreign
investment and convince leaders her country is stable.
   The Marcos loyalists are urging that Mrs. Aquino allow the
former president's body to be buried in the Philippines.
   Marcos, who ruled the country for 20 years, died in exile in
Hawaii on Sept. 28 at age 72. Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow his
body to be brought to the Philippines for burial.
   Ilocos Norte Vice Governor Rolando Abadilla, leader of the
march, said in a statement Sunday ``there is a growing number of
concerned citizens who are angered by the reign of hatred, greed
and terror.''
   He said his group is seeking ``radical, sweeping reforms'' to
eliminate what he said was corruption in the government of Mrs.
Aquino, who was swept to power in a military-civilian revolt that
toppled Marcos in 1986.
   ``The objective of the next People's March for Justice, which is
ending a reign of hatred, greed and terror, is now in order and
shall be launched in due time on a national level,'' Abadilla said.
   ``The fight for true justice, peace, freedom and democracy shall
definitely continue,'' said Abadilla, former Philippine
Constabulary colonel who headed the Metropolitan Command
Intelligence and Security Group.
   In a related development, Marcos' son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr.,
issued a statement published in a local newspaper condemning the
dispersal of Saturday's protest.
   ``By choosing to violently disperse the peaceful march and vigil
of tens of thousands of justice-seeking Filipinos, she (Mrs.
Aquino) has chosen force as a way to arbitrate the divisions in our
country,'' Marcos said.
   Mrs. Aquino said the show of force by Marcos' followers did not
diminish her confidence in her government's stability.
   More than 25,000 people attended the rally. It was the largest
demonstration by Marcos supporters in the capital since shortly
after his ouster.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told thousands of
sailors Sunday that Japan needs to solidify its defenses as the
Soviets improve their forces and regional conflicts persist.
   Kaifu, who is also commander of the 270,000-member Japanese
Self-Defense Force, was among 6,600 people, including officials
from 46 countries, at a navy review on the force's 35th anniversary.
   In his speech, Kaifu acknowledged progress in disarmament talks
between the United States and the Soviet Union.
   However, he added, ``The international situation still remains
complicated and fluid as the Soviet Union continues to hold
enormous military power and is modernizing its war potential. Also,
regional conflicts in the world are far from fundamental
settlements.''
   In this situation, Kaifu said, Japan, as an important member of
the West, must contribute to safeguarding peace and security in the
world.
   However, he made no specific proposals.
   The United States, which has a defense treaty with Japan, has
urged the Japanese to do more for their own defense. However,
military spending is a controversial issue in Japan.
   The Japanese constitution, adopted in 1946 during the U.S.
occupation, renounces war and the use of force in settling
international disputes.

   Riot police broke up a protest by several dozen
Armenian nationalists Sunday who demonstrated near the Kremlin in
support of their exiled leader. Seven people were arrested.
   About 50 Armenian protesters, members of the Organization of
National Self-Determination, waved Armenian flags and held banners
supporting nationalist leader Paryur Ayrikyan.
   The group demonstrated without interference for about 30 minutes
on the steps of Lenin Library. But riot police stopped them from
marching to nearby Red Square and twice pushed them through the
doors and down the stairs of a subway station.
   Police ripped banners away and dragged away two protesters who
resisted. They detained five more who subsequently refused to
disperse.
   The nationalists said they had not requested permission from
authorities to hold the demonstration. ``We didn't ask anybody's
permission. We don't ask, we demand,'' said demonstrator Igor
Grigoryan of Moscow.
   Police were negotiating with a handful of demonstrators to
disperse them more than an hour after the protest began. They told
demonstrators they were willing to release those who had been
arrested if the group dispersed.
   One demonstrator, Lev Gambaryan, entered a bus where the
arrested protesters were being held and he said they did not want
to come out.
   Ayrikyan, a former political prisoner, was arrested in Moscow
earlier this spring and exiled to Ethiopia. He now lives in the
United States.
   Grigoryan said Ayrikyan founded the Organization of National
Self-Determination.
   Armenia is one of 15 Soviet republics, many of which are seeking
greater autonomy from Moscow.

   Police used steel-tipped batons to
break up a satirical street play held as part of an anti-government
strike Sunday, and at least 15 people were hurt, witnesses said.
   About 300 people were on a Dhaka street watching the play, a
satire about President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, when police moved
in and dispersed the crowd, witnesses said.
   The actors and audience fled in panic as police charged, and at
least 15 people suffered injuries, witnesses said.
   The dawn-to-dusk strike, the 61st this year, was called by the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its allies to demand an end to
Ershad's 7-year-old government and to press for free elections.
   No private vehicles were on the roads, but a small number of
rickshaws, the traditional form of transportation for most
commuters, and some state-owned buses plied the streets under
police escort.
   The strike affected major cities across Bangladesh, including
the southern port city of Chittagong and the country's
third-largest city, Khulna, said opposition sources.
   There were no reports of major violence, but police said
students at Dhaka University, a hotbed of political unrest, set
fire to about a dozen rickshaws and cars that defied the strike.
   In Dhaka, a city of 6 million people, the strike began
peacefully. But paramilitary units and thousands of armed police
patrolled the city's major streets in one of the biggest shows of
strength seen recently.
   The strike was backed by several opposition groups including the
seven-party alliance in which the Nationalist Party is a major
component. The party was toppled by Ershad in a bloodless military
coup in 1982.
   Ershad has dismised opposition demands for his resignation but
indicated he would be willing to hold elections if all major
political parties agreed to participate. Opposition parties,
however, have refused to take part in polling under the current
government.
   In 1986, four years after seizing power, Ershad was elected to a
five-year term as president in an election opposition parties
charge was fraudulent.
   As in the past, the government ured citizens to ignore Sunday's
strike, and several pro-government organizations distributed
leaflets and posters showing how strikes hurt the country's fragile
economy.
   The government has said each strike costs this impoverished
nation about $78 million.
   Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest countries, with its 110
million people earning an average annual income equivalent to about
$150.
   Another anti-government strike is planned by opposition parties
Friday.

<TEXT>
   The Promised Land has failed to attract most of
the new wave of Soviet Jewish immigrants, but officials have
created a $3 billion resettlement program in hopes of reversing the
trend.
   Israeli officials want to lure 100,000 Soviet immigrants over
the next three years, a forecast many feel is optimistic. This is
because the new brand of Soviet emigrants, unlike those of the
1970s, are more interested in lifestyle than ideology.
   ``(Israel's) message of `Jews, come home' does not work,'' Inna
Shapiro, who immigrated 14 years ago and recently revisited the
Soviet Union, said on Israel's state television.
   ``Nobody asks if it feels good to be a Jew in Israel. They just
want a better life,'' she said.
   Earlier Soviet immigrants, many ardent nationalists, mock the
materialism of what they call ``sausage emigrants'' _ those who
seek quality food and goods that are in short supply in Moscow.
   Mikhail Chlenov, chairman of the newly opened Jewish Cultural
Association in Moscow, agreed during a recent visit to Israel that
today's emigrants are different.
   ``They are more assimilated. Their reasons are not specifically
Jewish,'' he said. ``Mostly, they are worried over the government's
instability, the spread of anti-Semitism, economic crisis.''
   Perhaps the strongest deterrent to immigration here is the
experience of many of the 250,000 who have settled in Israel since
1967.
   Their tribulations in finding good jobs and houses, dealing with
the tensions of the Arab-Israeli conflict and finding a place in an
insular, native-born society have filtered back to the Soviet
Union, influencing some future immigrants to choose the United
States instead of Israel.
   ``Israel's media and society gave the immigrants of the 1970s a
hostile reception. Economic incentives granted to new immigrants,
especially housing mortgages, have constantly changed for the
worse,'' said Yitzhak Yuzefpolsky, an electrical engineer who came
here in 1974.
   The emigration of the 1970s, he said, included outstanding
scientists, engineers and artists who have since left Israel or who
went directly to the United States because ``Israel could not
create the minimal conditions necessary for their work.''
   In an effort to make the Jewish state more attractive, the
Cabinet announced Oct. 30 a detailed program to build 25,000 new
housing units, start vocational training programs, create new jobs
and open new classrooms.
   Amos Rubin, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's economic adviser,
said Israel will try to raise $1 billion in donations and loans
abroad, mostly from Jews in the United States, to go with the $2
billion it plans to provide in Israel.
   Barring an unexpected flood of immigrants, he said Israel would
not seek new U.S. government aid, now $3 billion a year. Israel
would, however, ask for U.S. guarantees to underwrite a bond issue
to raise $400 million for private housing.
   Where the immigrants will be settled is a major issue.
   One controversial plan by Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz
calls for channeling the flow to rundown development towns in
remote areas where factories are closing and unemployment is high.
   Another proposal put forward by Yitzhak David, Shamir's adviser
on Jewish affairs, recommends Soviet Jews be settled in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Liberal critics argue the plan would deter Soviet Jews who did
not want to be thrust into the midst of the Palestinian revolt and
would complicate relations with Washington. The U.S. administration
has announced it would reject any effort to help settle immigrants
in the occupied territories.
   So far, the effort to attract Soviets has been a stinging
failure. In the first 10 months of this year, 7,275 out of 51,080
Soviet Jewish emigrants came to Israel, according to Uri Gordon, a
senior official in the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency.
   He said 284,550 of the 2.5 million Soviet Jews have requested
sponsors abroad so far this year. He predicts half will come here.
   The United States, where 162,000 Soviet Jews have settled in the
past two decades, has become the main magnet for Soviet emigrants.
   ``Businessmen from the United States told me that Soviet Jews
have created many jobs there. And in Israel, they only say that we
take jobs from others,'' said Vladimir Lifschitz, who arrived two
years ago after a long battle with Soviet authorities to get an
exit visa.
   Some Israeli officials see hope for an increase in immigration
to Israel as a result of new U.S. immigration restrictions that
have put a ceiling of 50,000 Soviet refugees next year.
   But activists say an influx should not be taken for granted.
   ``They think the Jews ... will come here of their own, just
because of the economic instability and anti-Semitism there and the
closing doors in the United States,'' Natan Sharansky, an immigrant
rights activist, told the Jerusalem Post.
   Sharansky, a dissident freed in 1986 after nine years in Soviet
labor camps, said, ``I'm very much afraid that after the first
10,000 to 15,000 come ... there will be a catastrophe. (Apartment)
prices will rise, there will be fewer jobs, the old absorption
problems will surface anew.''
   Israel's Absorption Ministry is currently financing jobs for
some 350 immigrant scientists and engineers but officials say they
are unable to handle any more cases. In addition, 100 scientists
from the Soviet Union and Romania are here looking for work, and 50
others are in the Soviet Union awaiting word on job openings.
   One Soviet scientist who visited Israel recently as a tourist
said he abandoned emigration plans after consulting with Soviets
who had immigrated earlier.
   ``I found out I could practice psychiatry but would have to give
up decades of research in neurology,'' said the scientist, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I could continue my work in the
United States, but for that I would not emigrate.''

   A gold-plated clock in a darkened hall
of a government hospital quietly ticks. It isn't marking time, but
the number of Indian babies born.
   After a minute, the clock hits 50. Within an hour, 3,000. By
day's end, 72,000 babies are born, 70,000 of them survive. At the
year's end, 17 million.
   ``It's like adding another Australia,'' said Ashish Bose, a
population expert and outspoken critic of the Health and Family
Welfare Ministry, the godfather of India's birth control program.
   Ironically, India was the among the first to launch a
government-sponsored family planning program. Since 1951, when the
program was set up, the government has tried almost everything to
check population growth, from cafeteria-like clinics distributing
contraceptives to coercion during the 1975-77 state of emergency.
   More than $1.8 billion has been pumped into family planning
programs in the past decade, three times the amount of the previous
30 years. But India's population has still mushroomed to 880
million, and the rapidly multiplying numbers are the single biggest
factor inhibiting economic and social development.
   According to government demographers, Indian's average annual
population growth peaked in 1981 at 2.25 percent and has since
declined to 2.12 percent.
   But even at the current rate, the government's planning
commission predicted, India's population will hit 1 billion by the
turn of the century and rise to 1.7 billion by the year 2035,
probably surpassing China as the world's most populous country.
   Already India is twice as densely populated as China, which has
1.2 billion people. The pressure is intolerable on the environment,
cities and basic services like water and electricity.
   Earlier this year, the planning commission spelled out the
dangers of unchecked population growth, citing falling food
production, environmental damage, rising illiteracy and
unemployment and worsening social tensions.
   Such apocalyptic visions have little impact.
   ``Doomsday warnings don't go down in India because of their
philosophy of life and what they have gone through,'' said George
Walmsley of the United Nation's Population Fund.
   Family planning got a bad name in India during the mid-1970s
when allegations of forced sterilizations caused a scandal and a
backlash that still lingers.
   When Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi took the helm in 1984, his
government launched new programs with catchy slogans. Every year
800 million condoms are distributed in India and up to 5 million
men and women are sterilized. But after five years, there has been
no sign of dramatic change.
   Opposition politicians trying to oust Gandhi and his Congress
Party in this month's parliamentary elections have lofty proposals
but shy away from discussing them.
   ``Talking about family planning is like singing the requiem at a
wedding,'' said one opposition lawmaker, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``If people don't want to adopt family planning and I
force them, then I'm finished.''
   The problems go much deeper than the lack of public enthusiasm
and manpower to implement a comprehensive family program in
ethnically and linguistically diverse India.
   Religious customs, traditions and teachings in the
Hindu-dominated country reject the very concept of family planning.
Most people believe the birth of a child is a gift from God and
that to do anything against the natural course would displease God.
   Male superiority and the importance of a son also are factors.
   ``I need two sons. Otherwise, who will carry on the family name,
who will help me in the fields, who will look after me in my old
age and who will lift my funeral pyre?'' said Datta Mal Jain in his
village in Rajasthan state.
   Additional hands to work mean additional income for impoverished
people, who do not know how many of their children will survive.
One out of every 10 Indian babies dies within the first year of
tetanus, diarrhea, diphtheria or whooping cough.
   Improved health services and eradication of famines and major
epidemics have lowered the country's overall mortality rate. The
average Indian now lives to the age of 58, compared with 32 when
India became independent from Britain in 1947.
   But overall statistics disguise huge differences between regions.
   The southern state of Kerala, where literacy and women's status
are high, has the lowest growth rate in the country at 1.53
percent, while northern Haryana state is the highest at 2.56.
   Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan in the north and Madhya
Pradesh in central India also have exploding populations coupled
with some of the country's worst poverty and social conditions.
   India's social and religious traditions subordinating women are
strongest in these states. Infant mortality is high, female
literacy, employment and marriage age are low, and acceptance of
family planning is poor.
   Before the sterilization scandal, 80 percent of operations were
carried out on men. Today 80 percent are on women.
   Male vasectomies are quicker, safer and cheaper than female
sterilization but men have passed the buck, and sensitivities over
the past mean the issue is not forced, Bose said.
   ``We have to find a way to play God but do it soberly,'' he said.

   He wielded power like a monarch, the
prosecutors say, arrogantly ruling over his fiefdom in the
foothills of the Allegheny Mountains and threatening retribution
against all who crossed him.
   But on Monday, Judge Joseph O'Kicki will sit in an unaccustomed
position in a courtroom: at the defendant's table. The man who
personified the law in rural Cambria County is now charged with
violating it through bribery and extortion.
   O'Kicki's trial has been the talk of central Pennsylvania, a
fixture on the nightly television news and the local newspapers. At
times, it has verged on soap opera, with allegations that the judge
ordered secretaries to take dictation while he was in his
underpants or naked, and that he ordered court workers to chop his
wood and feed his dogs.
   Acting with O'Kicki's approval, his friends paid for a four-page
insert in a weekly shopper last week that portrays the judge as the
victim of a sensation-hungry news media and witch-hunting state
police.
   It took a week to pick the jury for the suspended Cambria County
judge, and he now insists he cannot get a fair trial even with
those selected.
   ``Most of the people who came in there had a fixed opinion,''
the gray-bearded, 59-year-old O'Kicki said last week while standing
outside a Central Cambria High School classroom used to interview
jurors.
   It's certainly true that feelings run high, although many in the
local legal community are afraid to discuss him.
   ``There was just a tremendous element of fear that pervaded the
courthouse,'' said one attorney who, like many of his colleagues,
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``You never knew from one day to
the next whether you were his enemy or friend.''
   ``If you go against the judge, he can make it miserable for
you,'' said attorney Edward Peduzzi, who is semi-retired. ``He can
make a good case a bad case.''
   Last March, less than a year after O'Kicki's swearing-in as
president judge of a five-member court, a state grand jury
recommended he be charged with 13 years' worth of violations,
including extortion, bribery, lewdness and coercion.
   According to the 80-page presentment, O'Kicki peddled his
influence so widely and frequently that he even had his secretaries
prepare letters outlining his extortion demands and sent out staff
members to solicit kickbacks.
   Such letters were ``indicative of Judge O'Kicki's apparent
belief that in his official capacity he was justified in granting
`favors' to those who came before him concerning official
matters,'' the grand jury wrote.
   Among the lesser charges are allegations that he used courthouse
employees to perform personal chores for him and his family.
   More serious charges accuse O'Kicki of writing to Laurel Bank,
which had a request pending before him on an estate case, demanding
that the bank lower the 14.5 percent interest rate on a personal
loan he had taken out.
   ``Perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with Laurel
Bank in the near future, I may be inclined to reconsider your
request,'' said the letter, composed on courthouse stationery.
   The bank cut the rate to 11 percent.
   O'Kicki claims he was merely informing bank officials that he
would have a hard time being unbiased while the bank remained his
personal adversary.
   The grand jury also accused O'Kicki of forcing his bailiff to
pay $500 for a promotion that never occurred and of accepting at
least $500 from attorney Richard Green, who told the grand jury he
feared retaliation from a judge who was known to be ``always in
need of money.''
   The judge also must defend himself on charges stemming from two
incidents in which he allegedly called his secretaries into his
chambers, once wearing nothing but bikini underwear and once
wearing nothing at all.
   In his newspaper insert, O'Kicki promised that ``other info
involving the secretaries will come out at trial.''
   Local attorneys say that, despite the preponderance of charges,
O'Kicki will be a formidable opponent for the state prosecutor.
   He graduated near the top of his class at the University of
Pittsburgh Law School and is known for a keen mind and a
photographic memory.
   He was elected to his first 10-year term as a judge in 1971 and
re-elected in 1981. In 1983 he was voted president of the
Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges by the state's 400
judges.
   Although the grand jury recommended 76 charges, most of those
have been dismissed, withdrawn or combined with other charges.
Twenty-seven remain, 11 of which involve public corruption and 16
of which involve more private charges.
   O'Kicki's trial on Monday concern only the first 11. He will be
tried on the others later.
   The judge insists he will return to the bench _ if he can get a
fair trial.
   ``This is the system I have practiced in, that I have been a
teacher and a judge in, and to which I've devoted my entire adult
life,'' he said.
   ``I feel in my heart and my mind that I shall be back, that I
shall be vindicated in a court of law.''

<HEAD>Fishermen Rescue Four Survivors; 91 Crewmen Still Missing</HEAD>

   Thai fishermen Sunday rescued four
crewmen from an American oil company ship that capsized in a
typhoon the day before with 97 people aboard, the company said.
   The bodies of two others were found inside the still-floating
Seacrest, but the fate of other 91 crewmen from 13 countries was
unknown after two days of intensive search efforts in the Gulf of
Thailand. Seven Americans were aboard.
   ``We have not given up hope by any means and the search effort
will continue through the night,'' said Unocal spokeswoman Carol
Scott in Bangkok.
   Two Thai fishing boats picked up three Thais and one Indonesian
from the overturned oil drilling vessel, said officials of Unocal
Thailand, a subsidiary of the Los Angeles-based company that owns
the Seacrest.
   They were identified as Nico Matatula of Indonesia; and Somchoke
Noosuwan, Long Amphairit and Chavalit Duangpakdee of Thailand.
   Earlier, the company had said divers and pilots searching for
survivors had failed to find any signs of life within the ship or
in the surrounding sea. Rescue workers searched 600 square miles of
the gulf.
   A remote-controlled underwater vehicle located the two bodies in
the ship's living quarters. Divers will try to recover the bodies,
Scott said.
   The Thai navy sent divers and the special undersea craft, which
took videotape within the vessel. A section or all of the living
quarters of the ship are submerged.
   The 351-foot vessel capsized early Saturday after being struck
by 100 mph wind and high seas spawned by Typhoon Gay, described by
Thai meteorologists as the country's worst typhoon in 35 years.
   The Seacrest capsized in the gulf's Platong field, one of
several being exploited for natural gas by Unocal. It is 270 miles
south of Bangkok.
   After hitting the gulf, Typhoon Gay swept inland across the
peninsula of southern Thailand, killing at least 26 people and
causing extensive damage in several southern provinces, Thai navy
officers said.
   About 30 fishing boats with an unknown number of crewmen aboard
were reported missing, said officers at the Navy Operation Center
who requested anonymity.
   Family members of the missing Thai crewmen of the Seacrest
gathered at this coastal town where Unocal maintains its operations
headquarters and from where the search is being mounted.
   ``Everyone is feeling sad. We worked together for over 10 years.
We know them and there families,'' said Bunlue Waiprib, base
manager of Aamarit Associates, which recruits Thai employes for
Unocal.
   Aboard were 64 Thais, seven Americans, five Britons, four
Australians, three Filipinos, three Singaporeans, two Malaysians,
two Indonesians, two Canadians, two Danes, one West German, one New
Zealander and one Norwegian.

<TEXT>
   Peasants in the fertile region
around this mountain town in Contra territory are unabashedly
anti-government.
   President Daniel Ortega's lifting of a 19-month cease-fire last
week with the Contra rebels apparently has not changed their minds.
   ``I don't know about what Mr. Ortega said,'' said one
60-year-old farmer, sitting in front of his two-room house with
some friends. ``But you remember what they called him in Costa
Rica: `This little man.'''
   The farmer and his friends broke out in smiles, amused at
President Bush's scornful description of Ortega at a summit of
Western Hemisphere leaders last month.
   The farmer's response showed a defiance typical of many peasants
in this part of central Matagalpa province. Pro-Contra peasants
feed the guerrillas and provide information about troop movements.
   But they aren't foolhardy. Asked for his name and permission to
take his picture, the farmer demurred. ``Better not. It's not
good,'' he said.
   This farmer has a few cattle and grows corn and beans, like most
people in this rich agricultural region known for its dairy
products.
   He's not happy with 10 years of government by the leftist
Sandinistas. The economy is in shambles, and the young men, needed
in the fields, are drafted for two years when they turn 16.
   The war that began in 1981 and went into a lull for 19 months is
now starting again. And fighting means trouble in the daily lives
of the peasants in this region, whatever their political
convictions.
   ``Now nobody buys from us; there's no money,'' he said, his
friends nodding in agreement. ``I've gone to the bank to cash a
check, and they tell me there's no money.
   ``Me, I was born here and here I stay. But my boy, they grabbed
him for military service, and he deserted. Now he's in Costa Rica.
I want him to stay there,'' the man said of his 20-year-old son.
   The man lives a few miles from Rio Blanco, in the middle of
Nicaragua and of a corridor the Contras use to slip across the
Honduran border and head south.
   Most rebels left for Honduras after signing the truce with the
Sandinista government in March 1988.
   The attitude of this farmer and others like him is what has
allowed other Contras to survive inside Nicaragua so long.
   About 2,500 rebels stayed behind, and over the past few weeks
about 4,000 more have come back into Nicaragua from their Honduran
jungle camps.
   Ortega said their return had been marked by bolder and more
numerous attacks.
   The Sandinista People's Army is faced with fighting an elusive
enemy in mountainous territory where many of the natives favor the
insurgents.
   They have deployed thousands of troops armed with Chinese-made
AK-47 rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and mortars. The
government also has sent special anti-insurgency units from the
Ministry of the Interior.
   ``They (Contras) have 20 months in which we haven't rammed them
with a strong offensive,'' said Capt. Daniel Jiron, military head
in this area. ``Maybe they've kidded themselves that we lack the
conditions to do so.''
   ``We have spent these 20 months preparing our forces,'' he said.
   For the peasants in this area, 140 miles from Managua, the war
never ended.
   ``We have a great problem,'' one peasant said. ``The
(Sandinista) troops sleep here, and the others (Contras) pass by
here. And I have my family here.''
   The Sandinistas may eventually win the battle with the Contras,
but after 10 years in power, they still haven't captured the hearts
of many peasants as the country prepares for Feb. 25 elections.
   ``Only I know what I'm going to put on my ballot,'' the
60-year-old farmer said.
   ``I didn't go to school and I don't know how to write. I use
this as my signature,'' he said, showing a calloused thumb. ``But I
wasn't born mute or blind. I can see very clearly what I want.''

   Two moderate aftershocks on Sunday
rumbled through an area struck by a strong quake last week, but
authorities reported no injuries or damage.
   The first struck at 12:40 p.m. and registered 4 on the Richter
scale, and it was followed by a temblor measure 3.5 about two
minutes later, the Algerian Center of Astronomy, Astrophysics and
Geophysics reported.
   Four other aftershocks, ranging from 3.5 to 4.2 on the scale,
were recorded by seismologists Saturday night.
   A quake registering 6 on the scale stuck the North African
country on Oct. 29 and was followed 12 minutes later by one
measuring 4.8. The quakes killed 26 people, injured at least 450,
and caused heavy damage to towns and villages along the
Mediterranean coast east of Algiers.

   As he sat in his emigre daughter's comfortable
apartment, Gen. Ivan D. Yershov recounted how people screamed
``occupiers'' at the Soviet troops he led into Czechoslovakia in
1968 to crush the effort to liberalize that nation's communist
regime.
   ``We were told that we were going in at the request of the
Czechoslovakian leadership, to protect socialism, because
counter-revolutionaries were preparing to take over. And it was not
excluded that the West would intervene,'' Yershov said.
   Yershov said he was shocked when his troops were not greeted as
heroes.
   ``I had doubts on the morning of Aug. 21, when I saw that the
Czech people were unhappy that we had come,'' said Yershov. ``They
screamed at us, `You are occupiers.'''
   Eleven years later the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
intensified those doubts.
   His faith in the communist system broke entirely when his
daughter went on a hunger strike in 1982 to win permission to join
her husband and daughter in the United States.
   That was a different time, before Mikhail Gorbachev, before
perestroika. Regimes at least as liberal as the one Yershov helped
remove in Prague are springing up all over Eastern Europe, indeed,
in Moscow itself.
   The retired general's son-in-law now travels freely between
Washington and Moscow where he is trying to establish an American
University.
   But only seven years ago, when Yershov won permission for his
daughter, Tatyana Lozansky, to leave the Soviet Union, the fight
cost him his privileged post as a three-star general.
   Now on his first visit to America, staying in Washington with
his daughter and son-in-law, Yershov told The Associated Press that
he believes more than ever that he was right to question the Soviet
regime.
   And he says many former colleagues in the Soviet Armed Forces
support Gorbachev's efforts to reform their country, even if it
means a smaller role for the military.
   Yershov's assessment _ while by no means conclusive _ was in
contrast to the dour view of human rights activist Andrei D.
Sakharov who has warned of a potential military coup.
   ``The Army supports Gorbachev. Most of the officers and men
support perestroika. The Army takes orders,'' as it did in
Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan, Yershov said. But the line of
command is changing.
   ``Now the army is taking orders from the Supreme Soviet,'' the
parliament that is assuming greater power.
   ``Before, the Army was taking orders from the Politburo,'' the
body of a dozen or so top communists that has run the Soviet Union
for most of its 72 years.
   ``The Afghan invasion was decided on the Politburo level, two or
three people. Such decisions will not be made again by a small
group,'' he said. ``Gorbachev was right to withdraw from
Afghanistan.''
   Yershov does not believe the Soviet military would object to
withdrawal from Eastern Europe or a diminished role for the Warsaw
Pact if U.S. forces also withdrew from Europe.
   ``The countries of Eastern Europe should decide whether Soviet
troops should be on their territory. They should decide whether to
be members of the Warsaw Pact,'' he said. ``I know that many
generals feel the same way.''
   If Yershov's life has taken some unusual turns, it was for many
years typical for his generation. He came out of World War II as a
lieutenant colonel in the Soviet Army.
   He rose to two-star general by 1968, and on Aug. 20 of that
year, was deputy commander of the Soviet forces that invaded
Czechoslovakia.
   While Yershov and others were surprised by the hostile
reception, they kept their feelings to themselves.
   ``Among ourselves, we said that it was the right-wing
extremists, the counter-revolutionaries, who had made this
necessary,'' said Yershov. ``We never expressed doubts among
ourselves.''
   When Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan 11 years later, the
doubts grew.
   ``I met with many of my comrades who said it was a big
mistake,'' said Yershov.
   Jeopardizing Soviet lives and prestige to support an unpopular
government was unwise, he said.
   ``Only a small part of the Afghan people supported the
revolution,'' he said.
   ``I wouldn't have said all this 10 years ago, because I had a
big family that I had to support and protect,'' he said.
   Family became politics for Yershov in 1982, when his daughter
Tatyana began a highly publicized hunger strike to join her husband
and daughter in the United States.
   Tatyana married Edward Lozansky, a physicist, in 1972. Lozansky,
a dissident, emigrated with their daughter, now 17.
   Yershov opposed Edward Lozansky's departure, and asked him not
to go. At first, he refused to sign papers to allow Tatyana to
follow.
   Then Tatyana began a hunger strike, and Yershov realized ``it
was her right to come here, to join her husband and child.''
   Yershov's view of the United States changed when he arrived to
visit his daughter, now a U.S. citizen, and his granddaughter, now
a freshman at Brown University.
   Among his impressions, said Yershov, ``the most important is the
sharp contrast in the lives of the people of the United States and
the U.S.S.R.''
   ``We have shortages of goods, long lines in stores, and poor
services,'' he said. ``Here, everything is the opposite. Everything
is done for the people. That is the most important difference.''

<HEAD>Thirty-Six Killed in Tamil Fighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Tamil guerrilla groups battled
with guns in eastern Sri Lanka on Sunday, and at least 36 were
killed and 15 seriously injured, officials said.
   The fighting in the villages of Tampiluvil and Tamputte, both
about 20 miles southeast of Ampara, was the first clash between
rival Tamil groups since Indian peacekeeping soldiers left the area
two weeks ago.
   Military officials said about 50 members of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest rebel group, raided two camps
run by rivals and killed 30 men. The two camps are about a
half-mile apart, they said.
   Six Tamil Tigers also were killed in the fighting, said the
officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   The camps aparently are run by a group known as the Tamil
National Army, a militia organized by former rebels to try to
maintain order in the violence-wracked area.
   The officials said the attackers abducted about 30 men of the
Tamil National Army.
   Residents in Ampara, 125 miles east of Colombo, said an
unofficial curfew was being enforced in the town and that all shops
were closed.
   A Tamil Tiger leader in Colombo confirmed the attack. ``Action
has been taken to dismantle the illegal Tamil National Army,'' he
said.
   The Sri Lankan Army commander, Lt. Gen. Hamilton Wanasinghe,
said troops were sent to the two villages. The soldiers will ``take
necessary action and see that there is no repetition'' of such
incidents, Wanasinghe said.
   India withdrew about 4,000 soldiers from the Ampara district
last month, heightening fears of renewed bloodshed between Tamil
groups.
   The latest fighting marked a new phase in the 6-year-old
struggle by the Tamil Tigers and other guerrilla groups for a
separate Tamil homeland in the north and east.
   Most groups gave up the armed struggle under an India-mediated
accord in July 1987. The Tamil Tigers briefly accepted the
agreement but then turned their guns on Indian soldiers, who had
been sent to Sri Lanka to supervise the accord.
   The Indians' numbers swelled from 2,000 to about 100,000 as the
Tamil Tigers began attacking them. The Indian force has been
periodically withdrawn in batches and the remaining 36,000 soldiers
are scheduled to leave by Dec. 31.
   As the deadline advances, concern has been mounting over who
will keep peace in the area. Sri Lanka's small army is tied down in
its own battle against Sinhalese radicals in the south.
   Tamil Tigers are currently engaged in peace talks with the
Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo.
   Their demand for a separate nation grew out of complaints of
discrimination by the majority Sinhalese in jobs and education.
Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population.

   The head of an 82-nation
conference on population growth said Sunday that fighting
illiteracy among women is key to slowing a birthrate that could
more than double the world's inhabitants in 100 years.
   The U.N. Population Fund, sponsoring the conference that begins
Monday, will seek agreement on eradicating illiteracy among women
by the year 2000 and improving the availability of contraceptives,
conference sources said.
   The gathering opens the same day the U.S. House of
Representatives debates a $15 million proposal to resume funding to
the U.N. agency. The money was cut off in 1985 over an
agency-supported Chinese birth control policy.
   Nafis Sadik, the U.N. agency's Pakistani executive director,
told reporters the aim of the four-day forum is to thrash out a
list of ``recommendations'' that governments can use as targets in
their own population control programs.
   Those would include figures on bringing down infant and maternal
mortality rates and improving women's education, seen as a key
factor in determining their willingness to accept family planning.
   ``Attitude changes seem to take place ... where education levels
are higher, particularly (among) women and girls,'' she said.
``Women don't want to have so many children (but) they do because
that's what's expected of them.'' Demographers say the world's
population is 5.2 billion and increases by 90 million a year. If
nothing is done to slow the rate, the globe could contain 14
billion people by the year 2090.
   Under the U.N. agency's goals, all school-age girls should be
enrolled in some form of education by the year 2000, said a
conference source speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The source added that the U.N. agency was pressing for agreement
on making contraceptives available to at least 56 percent of the
world's women by the year 2000. The figure today is 45 percent.
   On the U.S. funding issue, Ms. Sadik said ``the first priority
to us is to get the U.S. back in the consensus'' on family
planning, rather than arguing for a bigger sum.
   Washington withdrew its $36 million funding of the agency in
1985 because of allegtions that an agency program in China included
forced sterilizations and abortions.
   The Senate has already earmarked $15 million for the resumption
of the U.S. contribution, but President Bush has said he would use
his veto if the measure is approved by the House.
   ``They (the U.S. government) don't really have any viewpoint on
the Chinese population program,'' Ms. Sadik said. ``The U.S.
decision has somehow got linked to the abortion issue in the United
States.''

   Ben Nichols doesn't mind being labeled a
socialist.
   But the man who is likely to be Ithaca's next mayor is quick to
emphasize that he's a democratic socialist _ a member and former
chairman of the Democratic Socialists of America.
   ``The key word is democratic,'' Nichols said in a recent
interview.
   The retired engineering professor defeated three-term incumbent
John C. Gutenberger by a convincing 56-to-44 percent margin in the
Democratic primary in September. He will face Jean Cookingham, a
former attorney for the Federal Housing Administration, in
Tuesday's general election in this college town of 30,000.
   The man who was known as the only socialist mayor in the nation,
Bernard Sanders of Burlington, Vt., stepped down in March after
serving four terms. Sanders, however, ran on a third-party ticket
dubbed the Progressive Coalition while Nichols is running as a
Democrat.
   In Ithaca, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by
more than a 2-to-1 margin, Nichols appears to have the election
sewn up.
   Nichols says being a socialist won't directly affect his actions
as mayor. But the socialist label, he said, ``does indicate what my
priorities are.''
   Those priorities include strong support for labor, the homeless
and minorities. Nichols also thinks real estate developers should
help pay for low-cost housing, and wants new laws to protect
tenants.
   ``My interests are much more those of the working people than
the prerogatives of business,'' he said. He said he is not
anti-business, but doesn't think business needs his help in getting
its voice heard.
   Nichols, who is midway through his first term on the city's
Common Council, said he also hopes to establish better relations
with Cornell University, his alma mater and former employer _ and a
major force in Ithaca.
   Cornell, he said, should pay more to the city for the services
it receives. Even if the tax-exempt university just paid for fire
services, he said, it could trim the city's property taxes.
   Not that he would reduce those taxes, Nichols added _ he'd
probably use the money for something else. More government takes
more money, although he would rather not raise property taxes,
which he considers regressive.
   ``I think we have to do a very vigorous job finding sources of
revenue other than property tax,'' he said.
   Nichols' Republican opponent criticizes his proposal to create
new government commissions, saying she believes in less government,
not more.
   ``I don't think with a tight budget that should be a high
priority,'' Cookingham said. ``I do not regard government as a
quick fix for a problem. The solutions that I have do not show a
great deal of government involvement.''
   Nichols' socialist tag hasn't been much of an issue in the
mayoral campaign, and the candidate says he doesn't expect any mass
defection of Democrats.
   ``I think it's because they know me,'' he said. ``I've been
involved in city government, I'm a known quantity. I'm not going to
do anything wild or irrational.''

<HEAD>Ryzhkov Appeals for Reason, Minister Travels to Strike Area</HEAD>

   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov on Sunday appealed to
striking coal miners in the Soviet Arctic to end a walkout that he
said endangers winter fuel supplies.
   Strikers reported that the minister of the coal industry,
Mikhail I. Shchadov, arrived in the area and that they expected a
meeting with him Monday.
   ``The situation that has arisen at present in the coal industry,
especially on the eve of winter ... creates an inadmissible
situation in ensuring vital supplies for our people,'' Ryzhkov
said. His comments were carried by the officials Tass news agency.
   Workers in the largest mine of the Pechora Basin in the Komi
region went on strike Oct. 25 to protest what they said were
government delays in fulfilling promises it made to end nationwide
mining strikes in July.
   The Pechora workers were joined last week by miners at 10 other
mines, and only two mines in the region were operating over the
weekend. Miners say more than 15,000 of them are on strike, and the
official media say the strike already has cost millions of dollars
in lost production.
   The workers also have advanced political demands, including the
removal of language in the Soviet Constitution that makes the
Communist Party the leading force of society.
   Echoing the slogans of the Bolshevik revolution, which the
country will commemorate Tuesday, they demanded that power be
turned over to local governing councils, land to farmers and
factories to workers.
   A local court declared the strike illegal but did not try to
halt it.
   Ryzhkov said the strike could lead to ``extremely grave
results.'' He did not elaborate.
   ``Appealing to your reason and workers' honor, I ask you to show
reason and a sense of civic duty for the consequences which can
arise in the country, to stop strikes, to maintain the necessary
rhythm of work, to ensure a normal life for the Soviet people,'' he
said.
   He said the Council of Ministers, or Cabinet, is keeping tabs on
fulfillment of the promises of better living and working conditions
that the government made in July.
   Government officials will meet with miners Nov. 17 to review how
well the government has kept its promises, he said.
   Vladimir Deneka, a spokesman for the strike committee in the
Komi regional capital Vorkuta, said in a telephone interview that
miners knew about Ryzhkov's appeal only from Moscow reporters who
had called to ask their reaction.
   Shchadov arrived in Vorkuta but had not yet met with miners,
Deneka added. The coal minister was studying the workers' demands
and was in contact with Moscow about them, he said.

<HEAD>Politics May Keep Charles From Speaking Out On Hong Kong Skyline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The razing of colonial buildings to make way
for a glass-and-steel skyline may irritate Prince Charles, but
politics could keep the architectural critic in him quiet during
this week's royal visit.
   The royal couple are coming to the colony despite a flare-up of
anti-British sentiment over the summer, when London made clear it
will allow only a small percentage of Hong Kong residents to settle
in Britain after China takes over the territory in 1997.
   Prince Charles and Princess Diana arrive in the British colony
Tuesday.
   They will spend much of their four-day official stay cutting
ribbons and visiting social service organizations, no doubt keenly
aware they are not to upset the colony's delicate political
situation.
   Charles has accused modern architects, planners and developers
of causing more harm to London's skyline than the German air force
did during the World War II blitz. He is to officially open a
couple of new additions to the skyline here.
   In a recently published book, Charles says many modern buildings
are devoid of character and fail to meet the needs of the people
who live and work in them.
   The prince tends to like classical-style buildings with
porticoes, columns and decorations.
   David Russell, a senior lecturer in University of Hong Kong's
architecture department, believes the prince will find much to his
dislike in the colony's architecture.
   Hong Kong's skyline is crowded with box-like office towers that
``create a completely dull and depressing environment,'' Russell
said.
   Russell views some of the newer additions, including the yawning
waterfront Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center the prince is
to officially open, and the prismatic 70-story Bank of China, as
among the ``colossal monsters of glass and steel'' going up around
Hong Kong.
   ``The human being put next to them is totally dwarfed and
rendered quite insignificant,'' he said.
   But Kellogg Wong, associate partner in the New York-based I.M.
Pei architectural firm that designed the Bank of China building,
has described it as ``a thing of beauty, a sculpture in itself.''
   Charles also will open the Hong Kong Cultural Center, a
low-slung windowless building that has been described as a ``ski
jump'' and a ``huge skateboard ramp.''
   Conservationists find this highly ironic because the center lies
on the former site of a Victorian-style railroad station they had
tried to save from destruction in the mid-1970s by appealing to the
prince's mother, Queen Elizabeth II.
   William Meacham, a former member of the official Antiquities
Advisory Board, said the station was a prominent landmark
overlooking the colony's famous harbor before it was demolished in
1978. Only the clock tower was left standing.
   Many other landmarks have been razed during Hong Kong's rapid
growth since World War II, leaving only a few of the graceful
colonial-era buildings still standing.
   But Russell and Meacham says the prince is not likely to say
anything critical.
   ``I think he was instructed to keep the visit rather low-key
because the British government certainly is not in very good odor
in Hong Kong,'' he said. ``Diplomatically, he will probably keep
his mouth shut so he won't put his foot in it.''

   Thai fishermen Sunday rescued four
crewmen from an American oil company ship that capsized in a
typhoon the day before with 97 people aboard, the company said.
   The bodies of two others were found inside the still-floating
Seacrest, but the fate of other 91 crewmen from 13 countries was
unknown after two days of intensive search efforts in the Gulf of
Thailand. Seven Americans were aboard.
   ``We have not given up hope by any means and the search effort
will continue through the night,'' said Unocal spokeswoman Carol
Scott in Bangkok.
   Two Thai fishing boats picked up three Thais and one Indonesian
from the overturned oil drilling vessel, said officials of Unocal
Thailand, a subsidiary of the Los Angeles-based company that owns
the Seacrest.
   They were identified as Nico Matatula of Indonesia; and Somchoke
Noosuwan, Long Amphairit and Chavalit Duangpakdee of Thailand.
   Earlier, the company had said divers and pilots searching for
survivors had failed to find any signs of life within the ship or
in the surrounding sea. Rescue workers searched 600 square miles of
the gulf.
   A remote-controlled underwater vehicle located the two bodies in
the ship's living quarters. Divers will try to recover the bodies,
Scott said.
   The Thai navy sent divers and the special undersea craft, which
took videotape within the vessel. A section or all of the living
quarters of the ship are submerged.
   The 351-foot vessel capsized early Saturday after being struck
by 100 mph wind and high seas spawned by Typhoon Gay, described by
Thai meteorologists as the country's worst typhoon in 35 years.
   The Seacrest capsized in the gulf's Platong field, one of
several being exploited for natural gas by Unocal. It is 270 miles
south of Bangkok.
   After hitting the gulf, Typhoon Gay swept inland across the
peninsula of southern Thailand, killing at least 26 people and
causing extensive damage in several southern provinces, Thai navy
officers said.
   About 30 fishing boats with an unknown number of crewmen aboard
were reported missing, said officers at the Navy Operation Center
who requested anonymity.
   Family members of the missing Thai crewmen of the Seacrest
gathered at this coastal town where Unocal maintains its operations
headquarters and from where the search is being mounted.
   ``Everyone is feeling sad. We worked together for over 10 years.
We know them and there families,'' said Bunlue Waiprib, base
manager of Aamarit Associates, which recruits Thai employes for
Unocal.
   Aboard were 64 Thais, seven Americans, five Britons, four
Australians, three Filipinos, three Singaporeans, two Malaysians,
two Indonesians, two Canadians, two Danes, one West German, one New
Zealander and one Norwegian.

   Young East German families squeezed
into tiny sedans poured through this border town toward West
Germany early Sunday, abandoning a homeland in which they had lost
trust.
   East German Trabant cars arrived at the rate of 30 to 40 an hour
at the border crossing to northern Bavaria, almost all of them
packed with people in their 20s or early 30s, many with young
children.
   ``We heard the news at nine last night, and by 11 we were
gone,'' said a 26-year-old woman from Schwerin, in the north of
East Germany.
   She, her husband, their two sons and a friend drove all night to
Cheb. Here, they met several other families and young people, who
like them, had leapt into their cars once they heard they could
travel freely to West Germany for the first time in their lives.
   ``My friend woke me up at two in the morning,'' said a
21-year-old from Annaberg, close to the Czechosolovak border. ``He
were are,'' he said with a grin.
   All the people interviewed expressed no confidence in their
Communist leadership at home, even if it does introduce reforms.
   ``My wife and I are leaving because we lost any hope that the
GDR (East Germany) will meet our expectations in life,'' said an
earnest 32-year-old worker from Leipzig.
   He recounted how his last hopes vanished the night of Oct. 3-4,
when he saw police beat children as security forces battled
thousands of people trying to get into the Dresden railway station.
   They were trying to board a special train going west from Prague
through East Germany.
   ``I didn't intend to flee myself, I simply brought friends there
who wanted to leave,'' said the man, who like others interviewed
refused to give his full name. ``It was horrible.
   ``Before that, I thought there was some future in the GDR. I
earned well. But they always told us the GDR was a peaceful state,
and when you see your hopes disappointed like that, you have to
leave.''
   A few of the waiting young East Germans said they wanted to try
just to visit West Germany for a day.
   ``We decided in the bar last night,'' said one of three
well-dressed youths crammed into a stylish Soviet car fitted with
Western accouterments that spell money in the East bloc.
   ``We just want to have a cup of coffe and come back again,''
said one of his friends.
   ``We don't do badly in the GDR,'' he said, while expressing deep
skepticism about the chances of new East German leader Egon Krenz
introducing genuine change.
   ``Nobody believes him. Really, nobody,'' said the third of the
youths, who came from the town of Plauen, the site of several mass
demonstrations for democracy in recent weeks.
   But the youths were disappointed in their quest. An East German
car at the front of the 50-car line turned around at the border,
announcing that it was impossible just to visit West Germany.
   ``We lost our bet,'' one of the youths shrugged as they headed
back home.
   But most of those waiting were going to West Germany to stay.
   One 32-year-old father from Weimar took two of his children and
drove through the night, leaving his wife and two more children
behind to join the family later in West Germany.
   ``The thought (of leaving) was always there,'' he said. ``Now's
the chance. We have no trust in the whole thing (in East Germany).
As long as those people are in power, nobody has any confidence.''

<HEAD>Fear of Failure Adds to Anxiety When Pilots Make First Carrier Landing</HEAD>

   Pulse rates quicken during any aircraft
carrier landing, but the heart-pounding is most intense during a
flight student's first time, say fellow trainees of a pilot who
crashed into the USS Lexington.
   The accident killed the student pilot, Ensign Steven E. Pontell,
23, of Columbia, Md., and four people on the flight deck.
   Pontell, stationed at Meridian, Miss., Naval Air Station, was
making his first approach to a carrier when he crashed.
   A few hours before the accident on Oct. 29, Ensign William
``Ray'' Dyer of Cookville, Tenn., was in the same position, but
landed without incident six times.
   Dyer, a student pilot at Pensacola Naval Air Station, said he
was calm and preoccupied with flying the T-2 Buckeye training jet,
the same type Pontell flew, until he turned into final approach,
called ``the groove.''
   ``I rolled into the groove and it hit me,'' Dyer said. ``I felt
my heart beat. That's the first time in a plane I've ever felt
that. I was going, `Oh my God.' It's like everything the past year
went, `whoosh,' right in front of me.''
   Studies show landing on a carrier _ in which the plane is
stopped abruptly via a hook hanging from its tail that is snared by
a cable strung across the deck _ puts greater stress on a pilot
than flying into combat, said Lt. Scott Means of Key West, an
instructor pilot at Pensacola.
   Means said a fellow pilot had the best description: ``It's a
cross between a pleasurable sex experience and a car crash.''
   Dyer said he couldn't let the crash bother him.
   ``Accidents will happen,'' Dyer said. ``It's not an
accident-free environment we live in.''
   That realization was magnified last week. The Lexington crash
was only the first of five accidents, all unrelated, involving Navy
ships and planes around the world that took seven lives in a span
of four days.
   Of all the Navy's activities, landing jets on ships may be the
most hazardous, but student pilots say crashing is not their
greatest fear.
   ``I would say the fear of failure is about 80 percent of it,''
said Ensign Bill Hiscock of Fort Lauderdale, another
Pensacola-based student pilot who made his first carrier landing
Oct. 29.
   ``If they don't do this properly there's a chance they may not
get their wings,'' Means explained. ``That's where the apprehension
comes from.''
   The consequences may be dismissal from the Navy or getting a
non-flying assignment. Historically, a jet student has rarely been
allowed to shift to helicopters or propeller-driven planes,
although the Navy may have spent up to $1 million to train him.
   ``The attitude that's taken is that the other communities ...
don't want somebody else's trash, so to speak,'' Means said. He
added however that the Navy is loosening up a bit on this tradition.
   By the time a pilot attempts a carrier landing, he has about 250
hours of flying time. All must eventually make 10 landings or
``traps'' aboard a carrier to complete their training.
   Before that, though, they make 80 touch-and-go landings on
runways painted with the outline of a flight deck. They make two
touch-and-go landings on the carrier before their first trap, all
without instructors because flying solo builds confidence, Means
said.
   Seeing the carrier for the first time can be intimidating, as it
looks so tiny from the air.
   ``I wanted so much to look down at the ship to see what it
looked like, and I just said, `I can't do it''' Dyer recalled.
   The hook hanging from the plane's tail is supposed to catch one
of four cables strung across the deck, bringing the jet to a dead
stop from about 120 mph in two seconds.
   Even though their ultimate aim is to stop, pilots push their
throttles to full power as soon as the wheels touch _ so they can
fly off the other end of the angled deck if they miss the cables.
   ``The first trap was a surprise. I didn't think I'd stop,'' Dyer
said. ``I ... hit the deck and the next thing you know I'm stopping
and a guy's running out to me, (shouting) `Power back! Power back!'
I had froze on the controls. And then finally, I said, `OK, I'm
safe. I'm down. I'm stopped.' ''

<HEAD>Poor Turnout at U.S. Embassy Rally Seen as Setback for Radicals</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radicals' effort to turn the 10th
anniversary of the U.S. Embassy seizure into a show of strength
backfired badly, indicating widening support for President Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
   The 10,000 to 15,000 who turned up for a rally outside the
former embassy Saturday is an insignificant number in Iran, where
attendance at such protests is usually counted in the hundreds of
thousands.
   The failure of the rally to develop into a massive anti-U.S.
demonstration was all the more telling since it had been preceded
by a week of radical exhortations for people to mark the
anniversary ``more splendidly than ever.''
   Iranians had been urged to turn the event into ``a day of hatred
for world arrogance led by the United States'' to hail the Nov.4,
1979 storming of the embassy by militants.
   They held 52 diplomats and other embassy personnel hostage for
444 days in what Iranians viewed as a revolutionary triumph that
humiliated the United States.
   The rally was addressed by radical leader Ali Akbar Mohtashemi,
the former interior minister whom Rafsanjani dropped from his
Cabinet.
   The climax came at the end of a 50-minute anti-American diatribe
by Mohtashemi with the burning of 160 American flags.
   Diplomats and other observers cautioned that the relatively poor
turnout should not be interpreted as a lessening of still
widespread anti-American sentiment in Iran or of inflexible Islamic
doctrines.
   These were imposed by the late revolutionary leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini. His death June 3, and the July 28 election of
Rafsanjani, raised hopes that Iran's leadership would move the
country away to some extent from clerical domination.
   Nonetheless, the slogan-covered banners carried by hundreds of
students who marched from Tehran University across the city to the
former U.S. Embassy compound underlined that Khomeini's spirit
lives on.
   The most striking slogan proclaimed: ``Compromise with the
United States is religiously forbidden, as the Imam (Khomeini)
said,'' and ``the Imam's line is to fight the United States.''
   This rejectionist approach contrasted with Rafsanjani's
perceived policy of seeking rapprochement with the West to end
Iran's isolation and help fund reconstruction, badly needed after
the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   At a news conference last week, Rafsanjani indicated readiness
for better relations with Washington, anathema to the radicals.
   His approach appears to have the backing of many people
increasingly resentful of the continuing hardships they have to
endure, resulting as much from the war as from the strict Islamic
rules imposed by Khomeini.
   Many people believe that last year's cease-fire in the war
indicated a general improvement in Iran's relations with the rest
of the world, particularly the rich Western countries that could
help the postwar rebuilding.
   This improvement has accelerated since Rafsanjani's election, as
underlined by the flow of business and diplomatic contacts with
Western European governments eager for a share of lucrative
reconstruction projects.
   The gradual relaxation of Iran's international isolation
coincides with an easing inside the country of the Islamic dress
code for women, which requires them to appear in public in the
traditional chador, or head-to-toe veil.
   Some women appear in public wearing makeup, scarves that barely
cover their heads, and capes that end well above the calf. It has
already drawn the ire of radical clergymen.
   Recent editorials in the more radical Tehran newspapers have
criticized this lack of ``hejab,'' or Islamic dress code for women.
   The editorials demand stricter enforcement, which the Rafsanjani
government is apparently unwilling to impose.
   The simmering conflict is an inseparable part of the
confrontation between the radicals and the so-called pragmatists,
as Rafsanjani is known.
   In what appeared to be another divergence of opionion between
radicals and pragmatists, officials at the state-run Tehran
television station, which is run by Rafsanjani's brother, Mohammed,
censored scenes of of U.S. flags being burned at the rally Saturday.
   The footage of the demonstration was being relayed by satellite
to Western stations via the Tehran studios, which frequently
control what goes out.

<HEAD>Namibian Voters Prepare For Big Step Toward Independence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Namibians of all parties and races vote
together for the first time this week in elections that will lead
to independence for their war-scarred territory.
   The United Nations has mounted its most extensive and costly
operation to monitor the week of voting and ballot-counting in
Africa's last colony, most of it sparsely populated desert.
   The election for a constitution-writing assembly will be
administered by South Africa, which agreed last year to end its
74-year rule over Namibia. Officials from 25 countries will observe
the voting, along with monitors from the 7,650-member U.N. force
that has been deployed in the territory since April at the cost of
some $450 million.
   Voting is to take place Tuesday through Saturday, with results
expected early next week. The 701,483 registered voters will be
choosing among 10 parties and casting ballots at 350 polling
stations.
   With an illiteracy rate of 60 percent, confusing ballot symbols
for the parties, intricate voter identification procedures, and the
presence of up to 25 observers at each polling station, there is a
strong possibility of disputes or delays before the outcome is
known.
   The focus of the election is whether the South-West Africa
People's Organization, or SWAPO, which fought a 23-year guerrilla
war against South African rule, will win two-thirds of the 72
assembly seats, enough to write the constitution without
compromising with other parties.
   SWAPO's leaders are known as Marxists and once threatened to set
up ``re-education camps'' for policemen and politicians who served
the territorial government. But since returning from three decades
of exile, SWAPO leaders have preached reconciliation among the more
than 1.3 million people _ including 75,000 whites _ spread over
318,252 square miles.
   Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, the top-ranking U.N. official in
Namibia, is charged with declaring whether the elections meet the
U.N. requirement of being ``free and fair.''
   Many Namibians mistrust the United Nations because the world
body for years designated SWAPO as the sole representative of the
Namibian people. It lifted that designation early this year.
   U.N. Resolution 435, which outlines the independence process,
calls for the constitution to include a bill of rights, independent
judiciary, periodic elections, multiple parties and free speech.
SWAPO has accepted those principles as ``guidelines,'' but its
election manifesto is contradictory and unspecific on those and
other issues, such as a free press and land redistribution.
   The United Nations has never specified the exact procedure for
declaring independence and forming a new government.
   If all goes well, a new government will take power early next
year, ending South Africa's rule over the former German colony
which also is known as South-West Africa.
   But all has not gone well, so far.
   On April 1, the first day of the U.N.-supervised transition
period, hundreds of SWAPO guerrillas crossed the border from
Angola, violating agreements and triggering battles that reportedly
killed 340 men.
   The United Nations brought home more than 41,000 refugees,
mostly SWAPO supporters, from a dozen countries to take part in the
election.
   Some of the returnees said they had been tortured in SWAPO camps
and falsely accused of being South African spies. A U.N.
investigation revealed that 315 people alleged to have been
detained by SWAPO were missing and 100 were dead.
   The four-month election campaign has been marked by
intimidation, fighting at political rallies, the assassination of
SWAPO's only white executive member, and attacks on U.N. forces and
journalists.
   Five days before the election, South African Foreign Minister
Pik Botha threatened to delay the voting and call South African
forces from their bases to deal with another alleged incursion by
SWAPO from Angola. SWAPO and the United Nations said Botha's
charges were baseless.

<HEAD>Walls Come Tumbling Down As Planned At Indianapolis' Occidental Building</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It took about 7{ seconds for an eight-story,
75-year-old building to collapse Sunday to make way for a
multimillion-dollar mall.
   Some 361 charges were placed on six levels of the Occidental
Building to bring the structure down. The building collapsed from
south to north, as a brief chain of explosive charges went off, and
witnesses applauded and cheered.
   The Occidental Building was imploded to accommodate the $970
million Circle Centre Mall project. The office and retail building
was once the home of L. Strauss &amp; Co., the city's oldest retail
clothier, from 1945 to 1985.
   The implosion was conducted by Controlled Demolition Inc., which
has taken down some 6,000 buildings around the world since it was
founded in the 1940s.
   Keeping the curious at a safe distance was one of the biggest
concerns, said company President J. Mark Loizeaux.
   ``People started to sneak around,'' he said. ``There was a bona
fide hide-and-seek game.'' The efforts by crowds to get closer was
an aggravation for the police department and caused a slight delay,
Loizeaux said.
   In two nearby hotels, the Hyatt Regency and the Embassy Suites,
rooms facing the Occidental were sold out in anticipation of the
big bang. The Hyatt Regency itself stands on a site cleared by
Controlled Demolition in 1973.
   Once the crowd was pushed back its assigned distance, the
implosion occurred. The project carried $30 million worth of
insurance, Loizeaux said.
   The Occidental, built in 1914, was one of a series of
skyscrapers built in post-Victorian downtown Indianapolis.

   Anne Murray has sold 20 million albums
worldwide, but the folks back in Springhill, Nova Scotia, don't
seem impressed.
   ``It's funny, they see me on TV and all, but it doesn't click,''
she said. ``To them, it's just ads.''
   Murray, who now lives in Toronto, also recalled an acquaintance
from her old hometown, a small mining community, who expressed
surprise at hearing Murray's records on the radio during a trip to
faraway Florida.
   When the Anne Murray Centre opened last summer in Springhill,
hundreds of people went through the museum, Murray said during a
recent interview here.
   ``It was so funny because they see this center _ and I think
they underestimate the impact that I've had or the people that I've
reached,'' the singer said.
   Murray, whose music has spanned both popular and country music
charts, had her first hit nearly 20 years ago with ``Snowbird.''
Her current single, ``If I Ever Fall in Love Again,'' is a duet
with Kenny Rogers.
   Murray said hometown folks help keep her humble. She recalled
that at a taping for a special shortly after her first hit song,
she suddenly heard the voice of a classmate.
   ``Who does she think she is,'' the girl said. ``Elvis Presley?''

   Visiting the site of attempts to ban his book
``Being There,'' novelist Jerzy Kosinski said censorship threatens
students' ability to question the world.
   Last spring, a group of Crete parents objected to descriptions
of sexual acts in ``Being There'' and tried to keep the novel out
of an 11th-grade English class. The school board didn't ban the
book but adopted a policy calling for closer scrutiny of reading
lists.
   ``The First Amendment is not the issue here,'' Kosinski said
Saturday at Doane College. ``Instead, the key need is communication
between parents and teachers. None of us wants the student to
suffer from literary malnutrition, so that he ends up with a TV
dinner.''
   The author of nine novels, Kosinski said he doesn't want to
restrict parents' rights to express curriculum concerns, but wants
them more involved in teaching their children.
   ``I feel that the classroom is not just a place where literature
can be pondered. It is a place where life is pondered, where a
reader can question issues,'' Kosinski said.
   Kosinski's visit was sponsored by the Nebraska Civil Liberties
Union and the Academic Freedom Coalition of Nebraska.

   ``The Rifleman'' has been spending too
much time off the ranch and in the city, so TV star Chuck Connors
has put his 8{-acre spread up for sale for $730,000.
   Connors played ``The Rifleman'' Lucas McCain in the hit
1950s-60s TV show of the same name.
   ``I love the ranch and really don't like the idea of selling it,
but I'm away so much and I like to keep it spotless,'' the actor
said in a recent interview. ``I don't believe in a weed and there
are seven out here that I can see right now.''
   The Tehachapi Mountains ranch, about 100 miles north of Los
Angeles, includes a 3,000-square-foot house, a guest cottage, and a
barn with three stables, three paddocks, a stud corral and
garage-workshop.
   Connors' most recent project is the television movie ``High

   Mayor W. Wilson Goode's 14-hour work days
may be over.
   As doctors try to determine what has caused the mayor's
heartbeat periodically to race, sometimes at twice the normal rate,
the mayor's spokeswoman said Goode may start putting in shorter
days at City Hall.
   ``He said to me that it might not be too bad to come in around 9
and stay till, oh, say 6 o'clock,'' Karen Warrington said. The
mayor typically has left home before 7 a.m. and not returned until
9 p.m. or later, she said, and he often worked seven days a week.
   The 51-year-old mayor was discharged Saturday from the hospital,
where doctors ran a battery of tests. He was admitted Thursday
after a portable heart monitor picked up two brief spells of rapid
heartbeat. A third episode occurred that morning in the hospital.
   It was the mayor's second stay in the hospital in recent weeks.
He was hospitalized Oct. 20 for cardiac tests after complaining of
neck and head pain.
   He was released the next day after tests showed that the mayor
has a perfectly normal heart, according to doctors.
   The mayor has said nothing about a vacation. He has taken only
one since he took office in 1983.

<DATELINE>SCHIRNDING, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of young East German
refugees rolled into West Germany at the rate of more than 100 an
hour Sunday, causing a traffic jam that stretched several miles
back into Czechoslovakia.
   ``The people will keep fleeing as long as they can,'' said
Christian Schreiber, a 23-year-old East German who joined
countrymen taking advantage of the new freedom to escape their
Communist homeland through Czechoslovakia.
   Driving their sputtering Trabants and Wartburgs filled with
stereos, luggage and children, the refugees needed to travel only
15 miles from the East German border to reach Bavaria in West
Germany.
   At least 15,000 East Germans had arrived in West Germany via
Czechoslovakia by Sunday, West German border officials said. They
came by special trains from Prague or drove their own cars to the
border after learning of the new escape route. Schirnding was the
closest border crossing for those using the new route.
   The refugees ignored pleas by new Communist Party leader Egon
Krenz to remain in East Germany and scoffed at his promises of
reforms. So far this year, about 170,000 people have left seeking
freedom in the West.
   ``People just don't trust the government,'' said Schreiber, a
dental technician from Staaken outside East Berlin. He and his wife
and son had been waiting seven hours in the cold and had a long
wait still to go.
   ``How long will they keep coming? That you have to ask Mr.
Krenz!'' said Uwe Luethje, the federal border police duty chief
Sunday afternoon.
   ``You can see how patient these people have been,'' Luethje
added. ``They learn that from waiting in lines for so long outside
shops.''
   On Friday, Communist officials in East Berlin agreed to allow
neighboring Czechoslovakia to open its western frontier for East
Germans seeking to go West. East Germany on Wednesday lifted its
month-old ban on travel to Czechoslovakia, the only country East
Germans can visit freely.
   Those who have stayed behind have demanded that the East German
government make democratic reforms and allow freer travel. As many
as 1 million people demonstrated on Saturday in East Berlin urging
reform.
   In East Berlin, a sign prominently displayed outside the City
Hall during a debate between local officials and citizens on Sunday
said: ``The Communist Party is driving the citizens out of the
country.''
   Like most of the tens of thousands of East Germans who have fled
West since August, the majority of the latest round of newcomers
were young people, many of them with small children.
   ``The older people just can't pick up and start a new life
somewhere else,'' Schreiber said.
   ``Pretty soon there won't be anyone except old people'' in East
Germany, one West German woman said as she scanned the sea of young
faces.
   Many refugees milled around their cars, others dozed, while
parents bravely tried to keep their children amused as temperatures
dipped to 40 degrees. Like the Schreiber family, many had to wait
seven hours or more at the checkpoint.
   Red Cross workers in a tent poured hundreds of cups of steaming
hot coffee and tea, while mechanics from West Germany's ADAC
automobile club stood by with offers of assistance for those whose
cars had trouble.
   ``We have no West German marks and no gas in the car,'' said
Marion Stahl of Magdeburg as she waited at the Schirnding crossing.
   But the 26-year-old woman added grimly: ``I'd never go back.
Never.''
   Earlier in the day, the line of cars waiting to cross into
Bavaria had stretched back nearly six miles from the border.
   In addition to the Schirnding checkpoint, East Germans also were
pouring into Bavaria at the Waidhaus crossing, which is the second
closest to East Germany.
   About 70,000 other East Germans have fled West through Hungary,
Poland and Czechoslovakia since August, when the reform-minded
Hungarian government began dismantling its border barriers with the
West.
   Together with a record level of legal emigration from East
Germany, authorities predict more than 190,000 East Germans will
arrive this year in West Germany, which grants automatic
citizenship to East Germans.
   Karl Heinz Horndasch, a spokesman for the federal border police
in Munich, said the number of temporary shelters jumped from four
on Friday to 25 nationwide as of Sunday afternoon.
   ``We are considering now whether we will have to open more,''
Horndasch told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>Round of Federal Indictments Latest Blow to Powerful Chicago Gang</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto CX1</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The El Rukns dominated the streets like no other
gang in city history, controlling a thriving drug trade with
ruthless efficiency for nearly 25 years. But officials are hoping
their reign is finally ending.
   Law-enforcement authorities say their latest offensive _ two
sweeping federal indictments _ affected most of the gang's top
ranks. Scores of arrests followed the Oct. 27 indictments charging
65 gang members and associates with counts that include
racketeering, conspiracy and murder.
   The indictments charge that gang members committed 20 murders,
attempted others and intimidated witnesses to control drug
trafficking on the city's South and West sides with links to five
states _ traffic worth hundreds of thousands of dollars a week in
street sales.
   Gang members who killed on their leaders' orders will testify
for the prosecution when the case goes to trial, probably next
summer, authorities say.
   ``We have definitely put a nail in the coffin,'' said Chicago
Police Capt. Ron Jablon, who led the raid on the Fort, the El
Rukns' fortified headquarters.
   Several defendants have already pleaded guilty. And the gang's
roster of 250-300 hard-core members already was depleted by
convictions and criminal charges.
   But the death knell has sounded before and the El Rukn gang has
been able to endure for more than two decades, creating a street
legend of violence, drug traffic worth millions each year, and even
international intrigue including an attempt to help out Libya.
   ``These guys are unique,'' said a federal official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``They grew up from little gang-bangers to
a major organized criminal enterprise that lived by shootings and
murders.''
   Also, if the indictments cut into the upper echelons, others
could step in.
   ``You're never going to eliminate street gangs completely, and
the sort of mystique of the El Rukn organization is going to be
hard to kick in a community where it's flourished for 25 years,''
said the official.
   Attorney James Graham, representing defendant Michael Sardin,
complained that the government is picking on a bunch of middle-aged
men who might once have been involved in the gang, but are now
associates at most.
   ``They're trying to clean the streets up of anybody that could
go back and revitalize the El Rukns,'' Graham said.
   One of the gang associates indicted is Noah Robinson, half
brother of two-time Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson.
Robinson was charged with offering the El Rukns money to kill two
men _ one of whom was slain _ and with supplying narcotics to the
gang's drug operation.
   The gang began in the mid-1960s on the mostly black South Side.
First called the Blackstone Rangers, it evolved into the P Stone
Nation, an amalgamation of several gangs whose leaders ruled
together.
   During that period of black pride, activism and power, two
members attended then-President Nixon's 1969 inaugural, and the
gang received federal funds for job-training programs.
   But the use of those funds was called into question, and leader
Jeff Fort received a five-year sentence for fraud.
   Fort became a Moslem in prison, and formed the El Rukn gang upon
his release in 1976, naming it for the cornerstone of a shrine at
Mecca.
   Authorities say Islam did not slow gang activity, though El Rukn
inmates once filed a federal lawsuit seeking permission to hold
religious services in prison. A federal judge ruled in 1986 that it
would be too dangerous to allow them to assemble.
   In 1987, Fort and four other El Rukns were convicted of
conspiracy and weapons charges, accused of offering to commit
terrorist acts for Libya against the United States.
   Fort _ who oversaw the effort from a Texas prison in coded
telephone conversations _ was sentenced to 80 years in prison.
   At the time, a Cook County prosecutor declared the gang was
``crumbling'' and that all their leaders were in jail.
   In November 1988, Fort was sentenced to 75 years for involvement
in the 1981 slaying of a rival drug dealer.
   And still the El Rukn gang rumbled on.
   Authorities say the gang uses hit squads to systematically
eliminate drug-trade competitors, and that the latest spate of
arrests may help resolve as many as 50 murder cases dating to the
late 1960s.
   Some officials put the toll at more than 100.
   The El Rukn headquarters is sealed and targeted for razing. The
site may become a playground.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Reportedly Planned to Kidnap President's Daughter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said drug traffickers planned to
kidnap one of President Virgilio Barco's daughters and a leading
presidential candidate as part of a major offensive, Colombia's
biggest newspaper reported Sunday.
   The newspaper, El Tiempo, cited police and senior government
officials as the sources for the story. A national police
spokeswoman told the Associated Press by telephone that she could
not confirm the report.
   The plots by the Medellin cartel were intended to prevent the
government from launching extraditions of drug suspects to the
United States, El Tiempo said. The traffickers' assassination Aug.
18 of another leading presidential hopeful sparked a crackdown that
foiled the cartel's plans, El Tiempo reported. That crackdown also
began a series of extraditions to the United States.
   The paper, which has a reputation of gaining access to
high-level officials, said police learned of the plot from suspects
trying to gain immunity from prosecution in the Aug. 18
assassination of presidential candidate Sen. Luis Carlos Galan.
   The paper said the offensive planned by the Medellin drug cartel
began with the slaying of Galan, along with the killings of a
federal judge and a state police commander the week before.
   Traffickers initiated the plan after determining that the
government planned to begin extraditions, the paper said.
   ``The chiefs of the Medellin cartel planned the kidnapping of
President Barco's daughter and the presidential candidate Hernando
Duran Dussan,'' the newspaper said.
   Barco's three daughters, Carolina, Diana and Julia, have all
reportedly left Colombia. Carolina owns a house in Bogota's
colonial section. Despite reports of her absence, at least six
soldiers with automatic rifles guard the house constantly.
   Hernando Duran Dussan, a 70-year-old presidential candidate from
Barco's Liberal Party, leads the polls in the presidential race to
be decided in May of next year.
   A strong opponent of negotiations with drug traffickers, Duran
Dussan said recently that he has received several death threats. He
did not identify any specific group as being behind the threats.
   The paper said Duran Dussan was to be kidnapped during a
political rally.
   In addition to the kidnappings, the Medellin cartel planned to
have assassins kill the head of the country's investigative police,
Col. Oscar Pelaez Carmona; the chief of its secret police, Gen.
Miguel Maza Marquez; and the head of the Communist Party, Gilberto
Vieira, El Tiempo said.
   The cartel targeted Maza Marquez in a car bombing May 30 that
killed seven people on a main avenue in Bogota. The police chief,
uninjured in the attack, has since led Barco's law enforcement
assault on traffickers.
   President Barco has issued decrees allowing the extradition of
traffickers to the United States and the confiscation of their
property in Colombia.
   Police and army troops have raided hundreds of farms, houses and
apartments in the weeks after the government crackdown began,
driving traffickers underground and disrupting their operations.

   Iran executed four alleged U.S. spies
during celebrations marking the 10-year anniversary of the seizure
of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iranian news media reported Sunday.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the alleged CIA agents
were hanged Saturday in Tehran.
   The news agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the four men were
tried, convicted and sentenced to death by a ``special military
court.'' It did not elaborate.
   It identified them as Touraj Riyahi, Kyanoush Hakimi Bushehri,
Ardeshir Ashraf and Ibrahim Moshtaqi.
   It quoted an unnamed Information Ministry source as saying all
four had aided the United States during Iran's war with Iraq, which
ended with a tentative cease-fire last year.
   The source said the purported spies ``put valuable intelligence
information at the disposal of the Central Intelligence Agency
during the war to help Iraq and facilitate terrorist activities in
Iran.''
   He added that the defendants' testimony ``showed that the U.S.
is continuing its hostile activities and interventions against the
Islamic Republic of Iran.''
   The agency did not say when or where the four were arrested. It
also did not provide further details of their activities.
   In April, President Hashemi Rafsanjani, then Parliament speaker,
announced that a spy ring had been broken and its members arrested.
   He and other Iranian officials have refused to give the number
of those detained, saying such information may prove useful to the
CIA.
   More than 20 alleged spies have claimed they worked for the CIA
in televised confessions screened in Iran in the past few months.
They all said they were recruited by U.S. Embassy personnel while
working abroad or while seeking visas for the United States at
embassies in Europe and Asia.
   Some of the alleged defendants were identified as army and air
force officers. Others were civilians.
   On Saturday, authorities displayed seven reputed spies at the
former U.S. Embassy compound in downtown Tehran in an attempt to
whip up anti-American passion on the anniversary of the takeover of
the mission by radicals on Nov. 4, 1979.
   The militants held 52 American diplomats and embassy personnel
hostage inside the compound 444 days.

   President Bush warmly welcomed the election
Sunday of Rene Mouawad as president of Lebanon and urged all
Lebanese to back his efforts to end the 14-year civil war.
   The State Department also issued a congratulatory statement that
singled out for criticism Christian army commander Gen. Michel
Aoun, who had tried to block the session of the Lebanese parliament
that elected Mouawad.
   ``We call upon Gen. Aoun and the Armed Forces to respect the
results of parliament's action,'' said State Department spokeswoman
Nancy Beck, reading a written statement.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Bush ``welcomes the election of Rene Mouawad ... The president also
commends Lebanon's parliament for its ratification of the national
reconciliation charter.''
   The State Department said that ``we extend to President Mouawad
our sincere congratulations and best wishes ... We ask all parties
to refrain from violence and intimidation and aid President Mouawad
in reunifying Lebanon.''
   To elect Mouawad, parliament met beyond the range of Aoun's
artillery at Kleiat, in Syrian-policed north Lebanon. The
parliament also ratified a peace plan brokered by the Arab League
last month in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   The State Department statement said: ``General Aoun, with his
confrontational tactics and threats of partition, does a disservice
to the state and people he claims to defend.
   ``We believe that the overwhelming majority of Lebanese wish for
an end to 14 years of war and a restoration of Lebanon's unity,
independence and sovereignty.
   ``The election of President Mouawad and the ratification of the
Taif agreement are the first steps toward achieving those goals as
well as the withdrawal of all foreign forces.''
   Aoun had threatened to shell parliament when it initially
planned to meet in Beirut on Saturday to ratify the Taif accord.
   The peace plan shifts political power to the Moslem majority
from the Christians, who were believed to be in the majority when
the existing political system was devised in the 1940s. Aoun
opposes the accord because it has no fixed schedule for a total
withdrawal of the estimated 40,000 Syrian troops backing Moslem
forces.

<HEAD>Oregon Peyote Case Back at High Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Oregon squabble over whether the
constitutional right to religious freedom can stretch far enough to
allow illegal drug use will be back before the nation's highest
court Monday.
   The case that's making an unusual second trip to the U.S.
Supreme Court involves religious traditions substantially older
than the U.S. Constitution itself.
   The battle began after two members of the Native American Church
were fired as counselors at a Roseburg drug and alcohol treatment
center because they had used peyote, a hallucinogenic drug, in
religious ceremonies.
   Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer sees unsettling implications in
the idea of giving constitutional protection to drug use. Lawyers
on the other side say the existence of an ancient religion could be
at stake in the case.
   Peyote, also known as mescal, comes from a small cactus that
grows in Mexico and the southwestern United States. Indians have
used it ceremonially for centuries and attribute spiritual
qualities to the substance.
   The drug is generally illegal. But the court case is a civil and
not a criminal action because Alfred Smith and Galen Black were
denied unemployment compensation on grounds they were dismissed for
misconduct.
   The Oregon Supreme Court in 1986 ruled that refusing to pay the
jobless benefits violated the men's First Amendment rights to free
exercise of religion.
   The state appealed, and the U.S. Supreme Court last year
returned the case to Oregon's top court with directions to address
the criminal status of the drug under state law.
   The state court again held that religious use of peyote is
protected by the Constitution although the drug is illegal by state
law.
   Frohnmayer, who planned to personally argue the state's case
before the nation's highest tribunal, says the Oregon Supreme Court
and U.S. Supreme Court both overreached in injecting the criminal
drug law vs. religious freedom issue into the case.
   As a result, he said in a recent interview, he has little idea
about what to expect from the justices in Washington.
   ``What they have in mind is somewhat baffling to all of us,'' he
said.
   Frohnmayer said he's worried about the court setting a
cumbersome precedent. If an exception is made for peyote, he asks,
what about religions that claim they need to use marijuna or other
drugs?
   ``The concern the state has is the specter of engaging in a
religion-by-religion, drug-by-drug examination,'' Frohnmayer said.
``Putting the long arm of government into testing people's
sincerity is troubling.''
   And Frohnmayer said the Oregon Constitution ``commands absolute
neutrality on religions.''
   Smith, a Klamath Indian who lives in Eugene, says the use of
peyote is a sacrament and that the substance is viewed as medicine.
   The years-long court case is unfair, he said recently.
   ``It's racism and bigotry. I'm just tired of it all,'' said
Smith, who'll turn 70 the day the case is argued.
   More than 20 states and the federal government exempt religious
use of peyote from criminal sanctions. Oregon has no such
exemption, and Frohnmayer doubts if one for a particular religion
could survive the state constitution's language.
   Craig Dorsay, a Portland lawyer representing Smith and Black,
takes issue with Frohnmayer's reading of the constitution.
   The language permits differences ``and certainly allows for an
exception for the religious use of peyote,'' Dorsay said.
   He said an adverse decision could severely damage and maybe
destroy the Native American Church.
   ``It cannot exist without the ceremonial, traditional use of
peyote,'' he said. ``It's a central part of their main ceremony.''

<HEAD>Israel Approves U.S. Plan But Seeks Assurances on PLO Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel on Sunday agreed to a U.S. plan for
initial peace talks with Palestinians but sought American
assurances the PLO will have no role in the negotiations.
   Vice Premier Shimon Peres, leader of the center-left Labor
Party, said decision-making inner Cabinet voted 9-3 to accept
Secretary of State James A. Baker III's proposal but asked for
``side assurances.''
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of the right-wing Likud bloc said
the government was hopeful it would get what it wanted from Baker.
   ``The next step will be to get the guarantees from the United
States and then to start talking about the composition of the
Palestinian delegation,'' said Avi Pazner, a top aide to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir. He said of the assurances sought: ``Sum it
up in one item: no negotiations with the PLO.''
   Both Peres and Pazner said Israel wanted the guarantee in
writing.
   The talks could be a long time in coming. Baker's plan calls for
a Palestnian delegation ``acceptable'' to Israel, and choosing the
actual delegates will likely take time.
   Israel television reported the government's acceptance of the
U.S. plan was based on various assumptions.
   One was that Israel would only accept Palestinian delegates from
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Another was that Washington would support Israel's position if
Israel were forced to leave the talks because ground rules agreed
on with Baker had been violated.
   The decision comes two weeks before Shamir's scheduled visit to
the United States. He could have expected a chilly reception in
Washington had Israel rejected the American plan.
   Six months ago, Shamir proposed elections in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip to choose Palestinians to negotiate an
agreement on self-rule for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the
territories.
   Baker's plan calls for a preliminary meeting in Cairo with a
Palestinian delegation to discuss implementing the election plan.
   Sunday's decision ends the wrangling over the Baker plan between
Labor and the right-wing Likud bloc, partners in Israel's coalition
government.
   But it is certain to increase dissent in Shamir's Likud bloc,
whose hard-line members oppose the Baker proposal as a backdoor
entry to peace talks for the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Israel refuses to deal with the PLO, which it considers a terrorist
organization.
   Housing Minister David Levy, a leader of the party's
hard-liners, said the vote would put Israel in a ``very difficult
situation.''
   ``The PLO in Egypt is coordinating positions ... and everyone
here is acting like blind men who don't know what is happening,''
he told Israel radio.
   Science Minister Ezer Weizman, a Labor left-winger, agreed the
vote would open the way to PLO participation but complained that
Israel should openly say so.
   ``Anyhow, we have indirect negotiations with the PLO,'' he told
reporters after the nearly three-hour meeting. ``It is a bit
hypocritical to say we are not negotiating with the PLO. I think we
are still going in the right direction in the wrong way.''
   In Cairo, meanwhile, the PLO's executive committee wound up two
days of meetings Sunday to decide if it will accept Baker's plan.
   Committee member Abdallah El-Harani was quoted as saying the
15-member group ``crystallized a united position,'' but he would
not say what the position was.
   In the Gaza Strip, Palestinian leader Assad Saftawi, a longtime
associate of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, said he and several other
residents of the occupied territories were invited to Cairo next
week for meetings with Egyptian officials.
   Under Baker's plan, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will help
form the Palestinian delegation to the Cairo meeting. Last week,
Mubarak drew criticism from Israeli officials when he said that in
effect he was only acting as a middleman for the PLO.
   Once agreement is reached on holding talks in Cairo, the next
step in the U.S. plan is for Baker to meet with the Egyptian and
Israeli foreign ministers on the makeup of the Palestinian
delegation.

<HEAD>`Very Pleased' Quayle Says of Bush Newspaper Endorsement For Second
Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>EDS: To restore dropped matter, sub graf 2: ``There are ... said

   Vice President Dan Quayle pronounced himself
``very pleased'' Sunday with President Bush's stated intention of
keeping him on the Republican ticket in 1992, but said it is too
early to speak of his own presidential ambitions.
   ``There are things that can happen between now and '92. And 1993
and 1996 are a long, long time away,'' said Quayle.
   Bush stated his commitment in response to a question during an
interview with The Dallas Morning News, which published the account
this weekend.
   Quayle, appearing Sunday on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the
Press,'' said Bush had not informed him face-to-face of the
decision, but that ``I am very pleased that the president is
pleased with the job that I am doing.''
   Asked whether he had thought about running for president, Quayle
said, ``What has crossed my mind is just doing a good job right
now.''
   The chairmen of the Republican, and Democratic, parties also
pronounced themselves pleased Sunday with Bush's stated intention _
for predictably different reasons.
   ``I'm very glad to hear that,'' said Democratic National
Chairman Ron Brown. ``It certainly pleases me. The problem with
this administration: It's been an administration of symbols over
substance. Dan Quayle is a good symbol for the Democrats to take a
hard look at. I think what we need is some strong leadership, and
not a continuation of this weather vane presidency.
   Appearing with Brown on ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''
GOP Chairman Lee Atwater said he was ``delighted'' with the idea of
Quayle being with Bush on a 1992 ticket.
   ``I think he's done a good job,'' said Atwater. ``He's been
loyal to the president. He's a good man. And I think the more the
American people see him over the next few years, the more they're
going to like him.''
   On his TV appearance, Quayle proclaimed undying loyalty to the
president and echoed Bush's lingering distrust of the Soviet Union,
commitment to deploy Star Wars antimissile defenses, and opposition
to abortion.
   The vice president also blamed Moscow, in part, for prolonging
the strife in Central America by shipping arms to Nicaragua.
   ``The fact of the matter is, is that the Soviet Union continues
direct ... shipments to Nicaragua of military equipment,'' he said.
   The issue was raised by Secretary of State James A. Baker in his
meeting in September with the Soviet foreign minister and would be
raised again by Bush in his Dec. 2-3 summit with President
Gorbachev, said Quayle.
   At the summit, Gorbachev will not find a sympathetic ear if he
tells Bush the Kremlin is cracking down because of instability in
the Soviet Union, said Quayle.
   ``If ... the Soviet Union or any other country begins to abuse
human rights, moves in a regressive direction, they would not have
sympathy from this administration,'' said Quayle.
   Despite Gorbachev's reforms, Quayle said: ``The military
capability of the Soviet Union has not decreased. It has increased.
Furthermore, let us also realize that the military spending,
contrary to all these statements that are going on, in the Soviet
Union has increased. The United States has decreased its military
spending. Not the Soviet Union.''
   And he said that ``the Soviet should understand ... that
President Bush is committed to the development and deployment of a
strategic defense system,'' popularly known as Star Wars.
   Quayle endorsed Bush's decision to veto two bills passed by
Congress that, in one instance, would have allowed the use of
federal money to finance abortions for poor women who were the
victims of rape or incest and, in the other, allowed the District
of Columbia to use its own money to finance abortions for poor
women.
   ``Despite some of the public opinion polls that have been
published, I think that the majority of the people, when it comes
to public taxpayer financing of abortion, want to have a very
strict limitation on how the ... taxpayers' money is going to be
used for abortion,'' Quayle said.

   Seven members of a Palestinian terrorist group
will likely be named in a Scottish police report as being
responsible for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, The Sunday Times
of London said.
   The newspaper said the report will go to Lord Fraser, the Lord
Advocate, Scotland's senior law officer who is supervising the
police investigation into the Dec. 21 bombing over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
   Fraser issued a statement on Sunday calling on news media to
exercise restraint in their reports lest they ``seriously
jeopardize'' the international criminal investigation and any
future court proceedings.
   Authorities have not said when the report on the investigation
will be released.
   ``Our essential purpose is put at risk if premature disclosure
shuts off lines of inquiry or puts potenial witnesses under
threat,'' he said, adding, ``I have also noted considerable
ill-informed and inaccurate speculation in relation to the federal
German police ... and other international agencies.''
   Some details in The Sunday Times story have been reported
previously, but the newspaper, quoting unnamed Western intelligence
and security sources, now claims to trace the bomb from its
manufacture to its placement aboard the flight.
   It said Western intelligence agencies are convinced Iran paid
Ahmed Jibril, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, to bomb Flight 103 as revenge for the
shooting down of an Iranian airliner by an American warship last
year.
   The newspaper said Jibril ordered his top aide, Hafez Kassem
Dalkamoni, to set up the bombing team and that Dalkamoni recruited
Marwan Khreesat, a 44-year-old Jordanian, to make the bomb.
   The radical Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command often has been identified as the prime
suspect in the Flight 103 bombing. In a U.S. television interview
in April, Jibril denied his organization had a role in the attack
that killed all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
   The Sunday Times alleged Khreesat assembled the bomb in
Frankfurt and that it was then concealed in a radio-cassette player
and smuggled to the Mediterranean island of Malta by a Palestinian
named Ramzi Diab, also known as Salah Fiaz Kwieks.
   Khreesat and Diab were both arrested by West German police in
raids in October 1988, but released.
   Fraser said Sunday that the head of the British investigative
team, Chief Constable George Esson, could not substantiate reports
about unaccompanied luggage traveling from Malta to Frankfurt,
``let alone unaccompanied baggage with a bomb in it.''
   The Sunday Times said West German police suspected Khreesat of
being a terrorist bomb-maker but freed him for lack of evidence,
even though he was being sought for two bombings of civilian
aircraft in the early 1970s and police had found in his car a
barometric or altitude-sensitive bomb of the type used on Flight
103.
   In Malta, Diab gave the bomb to a Palestinian cell operating in
the resort town of Sliema, the newspaper said. It said Dalkamoni
and Abu Talb, another Palestinian, traveled to Malta and instructed
the cell to put the bomb on board an Air Malta flight to Frankfurt
where Flight 103 originated.
   The passengers and baggage transferred to a larger Boeing 747
during a stopover at London's Heathrow Airport to continue the New
York-bound flight.
   Talb is currently in custody in Uppsala, Sweden, awaiting
separate bomb charges. Dalkamoni is in custody in West Germany
pending charges of attacking American military targets.
   The Sunday Times also said investigators have questioned a
British couple, Geoffrey and Christine Middleton, who were
vacationing in Malta three weeks before the bombing.
   It said they saw a blonde woman and an Arab man ask Western
tourists in a cafe in Sliema to carry a suitcase ``full of fluffy
toys'' on a flight from Valletta, Malta's capital. These were
presumably the sixth and seventh people to be named in the report,
but the newspaper did not name them.
   The Sunday Correspondent, citing unidentified police sources,
said the bomb that destroyed Flight 103 began its journey in a
suitcase loaded onto a Cyprus Air jet at Larnaca airport.
   The newspaper said at least four U.S. intelligence agents who
died on board Flight 103 also began their journey in Larnaca. Three
agents were reported to have been returning from an undercover
mission believed to be connected with the U.S. hostages in Lebanon,
it said.
   One of their suitcases arrived at John F. Kennedy Airport in New
York three days after the bombing, leading investigators to suspect
it may have been substituted at Larnaca airport for the suitcase
containing the bomb, the newspaper said.

   When Masafumi Higashi saw the images
of toppled buildings and collapsed freeways on Japanese television
last month, he was compelled to help the victims of the Bay area
earthquake.
   ``My first reaction was to come here,'' said the 25-year-old
English major from Chuo University in Tokyo. ``I felt it was my
duty.''
   Higashi came, along with 32 other fellow students, each paying
about $750 of their own money for air fare.
   Japan Airlines offered the students that low-price round-trip
fare when it learned of their mission to help victims of the Oct.
17 earthquake, Higashi said. Toshiba donated two computers to the
cause.
   Also in the student group was Isao Suzuki, 64, who built fighter
airplanes for the Japanese air force during World War II. He said
he wanted to repay a debt to the American people.
   ``The younger generation today in Japan has forgotten the debt
that we owe to America,'' Suzuki said Friday through an
interpreter. ``A big part of the reason we've been able to develop
into the country we are today is that America helped us.''
   Seven students arrived in California on Oct. 26 and the rest
arrived Wednesday after obtaining necessary passports and funds.
   After talking to disaster officials in San Francisco, the first
wave of students learned the big city was saturated with
volunteers. Their help was most needed in hard-hit Santa Cruz
County to the south, particularly in the small farming town of
Watsonville.
   They eventually wound up at Watsonville's Salvation Army
headquarters, where workers last week were still distributing food
and other essentials daily to about 300 earthquake-devastated
families.
   ``As soon as they arrived here from the airport, they wanted to
start work right away,'' Salvation Army Capt. Kirk Suarez said of
the students, who at times have accounted for as much as half the
volunteer staff laboring at agency headquarters near downtown.
   ``I'm really fortunate to have them here,'' Suarez said.
``They've done a lot of work. I'm amazed at their energy.''
   Aid from Japan is coming in the form of money as well as people
Japanese companies so far have pledged nearly $9.3 million in
donations to the earthquake relief effort, according to officials
of the Consulate General of Japan.
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Sony Corp. each has
pledged $1 million, with other companies offering equipment or
relief donations from $75,000 to $500,000, said officials at the
Japan Information Center in San Francisco.
   The students said they have worked about eight hours a day,
seven days a week since their arrival.
   They have spent their nights at a Salvation Army shelter in
nearby Scotts Valley.
   Every morning, Suzuki wakes them up and leads them in an old
Japanese army cheer, which translates as ``let's do our best.''
   Their work of sorting donated clothing and packing boxes of food
has not left the students time to see California, but they said
they have observed and learned during their short time in
Watsonville.
   ``We came here to work, not for sightseeing,'' said Nao Koike, a
20-year-old political science major. ``I will go sightseeing the
next time I come back.''
   Working in Watsonville, which has a large Hispanic population,
has shattered a lot of stereotypes for Ms. Koike.
   She said she once thought ``America was like a movie, with all
white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.''
   ``But now I know America has many kinds of people: blacks,
Asians, Hispanics,'' she said.
   For Haru Sato, a 21-year-old law student, the experience has
been ``important, valuable, interesting.''
   ``One of my biggest suprises has been to see how many people are
working here,'' Sato said. Such voluntarism is unusual in Japan,
where tight-knit families take care of their own during crises, he
said.
   Also surprising has been the optimism of the American people in
the face of disaster, said Sato.
   ``The Japanese people tend to withdraw in such circumstances;
the American people are just glad to be alive,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scowcroft Says West Germany Can Cope With Refugee Influx</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House national security adviser
predicted Sunday that West Germany will be able to cope with the
thousands of East Germans refugees crossing its border, but called
the situation explosive.
   ``West Germany can handle it,'' Scowcroft said on the CBS-TV
program ``Face the Nation.'' Nevertheless, he said, ``We're making
plans for whatever might happen.
   ``It would be easy ... for something to happen, something
unexpected which could turn what is still, even despite a million
people, a relatively orderly process into chaos or an explosion,''
Scowcroft said.
   The separation of Germany into two parts since World War II has
been a recurrent source of East-West tension.
   The democratic reforms sweeping the Soviet bloc have rekindled
the ``German question'' because, said Scowcroft, ``there is no East
German nation. They distinguish themselves only by their political
and economic system so that to the extent that they reform, they
undercut their reason for existence.''
   Scowcroft predicted that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
in his planned Dec. 2-3 summit with President Bush, will not ask
the West for massive credits for Poland and Hungary as they move
out of the Soviet orbit.
   ``I don't think his intention is to throw Eastern Europe to the
West to bail out,'' said Scowcroft. ``I think he is using
developments in Poland and Hungary to bolster his own attempts at
reform.''
   Discussing administration preparations for the Gorbachev
meeting, Scowcroft said, ``We're anticipating anything he could
conceivably ask.''
   At the summit, Gorbachev would meet an angry reaction if he
informed Bush the Kremlin planned to crack down to restore
stability.
   ``What we would do is point out to him that one of the reasons
for the more favorable attitude of the administration, of the
American people, toward the Soviet Union, is the opening up ... the
tendency toward pluralism ... glasnost ... and perestroika. To the
extent that disappears, our feelings will disappear,'' said
Scowcroft.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, appearing on the NBC-TV program,
``Meet the Press,'' had the same message for Moscow.
   ``If ... the Soviet Union or any other country begins to abuse
human rights, moves in a regressive direction, they would not have
sympathy from this administration,'' said Quayle.

<HEAD>Pediatricians Update List of Safe Drugs for Breast-feeding Babies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mothers who breast-feed their babies while taking
tranquilizers or other drugs to combat the ``baby blues'' are
subjecting their infants to unknown health risks and should check
with their doctors, says a report issued Sunday.
   The report, a policy statement by the American Academy of
Pediatrics, says use of tranquilizers such as diazepam,
antidepressants such as imipramine, and 17 other similar
medications ``may be of concern'' to nursing mothers. Diazepam is
marketed as Valium and imipramine is marketed as Tofranil,
SK-Pramine and Imavate.
   The effect of such drugs on babies who ingest them through
breast milk is unknown, said the academy, an organization of 37,000
pediatricians which is based in suburban Elk Grove Village.
   ``It's a dilemma,'' said Dr. Cheston Berlin, a member of the AAP
Committee on Drugs and author of the report. ``For some of these
women, nursing's important to them. Taking their medication is also
going to be important.''
   The committee stopped short of advising women against using
anti-depressants, anti-anxiety drugs and anti-psychotics,
recommending rather that women consult their doctors.
   ``The emphasis should be that the nursing mother discuss it with
her physician, and the two of them decide what's best for both''
mother and child, said Berlin, who heads the general pediatrics
division at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pa.
   The report is an update of the academy's 1983 statement.
   It lists 130 drugs and divides them into groups: those that
should not be taken by nursing mothers; those known to be safe;
those that can be used with caution; those that can be used if the
mother temporarily halts breast-feeding; and those whose effects
are unknown, a newly compiled section.
   The committee said the vast majority of drugs a nursing woman is
likely to take are ``usually compatible with breast-feeding.''
   Physicians should always ask themselves whether the mother
really needs the drug in question and should choose the safest
drug, the committee said.
   For example, nursing women who need pain relievers should take a
non-aspirin medication rather than aspirin, which can affect an
infant's chemical balance, blood-clotting or can cause a rash.
   The committee also suggested physicians consider doing blood
tests on infants of nursing mothers taking drugs that may be of
concern. And the risk from a medication may be minimized by having
the mother take it after a feeding or before the infant is
scheduled for its longest sleep, the committee said.
   Jeanine Klaus, president of the International Lactation
Consultants Association, praised the academy's recommendation that
each woman consult her physician.
   ``It cushions the warnings on any particular drug, putting it
into an appropriate perspective,'' said Ms. Klaus, whose group is
comprised of 2,000 health care professionals.
   ``What they are saying is, `Maintain this breast-feeding
relationship _ use caution _ but try to maintain it,''' she said in
a telephone interview Saturday from Atlanta.
   Estimates on the number of women who suffer severe emotional
problems after giving birth range from 4 percent to 10 percent, but
up to 80 percent of new mothers may have milder cases of ``baby
blues,'' she said.
   Julie Stock, a spokeswoman for La Leche League International, a
Franklin Park, Ill.-based group that offers support and information
for nursing mothers, said many women may be incorrectly prescribed
drugs for post-partum emotional problems.
   ``Rather than counseling a woman ... it's easy to write a
prescription,'' she said.
   ``If women gave birth in a more supportive environment and came
home with the babies to a more supportive environment, I think
fewer women would be plunged into post-partum depression,'' Stock
said.

<HEAD>Former Christian Democrat Party Leader Dead at 77</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAVENNA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Benigno Zaccagnini, who headed
Italy's dominant Christian Democratic Party during its brief
``historic compromise'' with the Communists in the 1970s, died
Sunday. He was 77.
   Zaccagnini, whose political career spanned five decades and
peaked during one of the country's most volatile post-World War II
periods, died in a Ravenna hospital after suffering a heart attack.
   Born in Ravenna on April 7, 1912, Zaccagnini was elected to
Parliament for the first time in 1948. He was re-elected to the
Chamber of Deputies nine consecutive times and elected to the
Senate in 1983.
   He served as secretary of the Christian Democrats from 1975 to
1980, replacing Amintore Fanfani as party chief after the
Communists made strong gains in regional and municipal elections.
   In 1976, the Communists drew almost even with the Christian
Democrats in national elections, opening the way for the compromise
for power sharing by the two parties.
   Zaccagnini rejected a formal governing alliance with the
Communists but said they could play a constructive opposition role
to help Italy through its economic and monetary crisis.
   The compromise was partially realized in 1978 when Christian
Democrat Premier Aldo Moro worked out an arrangement giving the
Communists a voice in government policies but no Cabinet seats.
   Red Brigades terrorists kidnapped Moro the day the pact was
going into force in Parliament on March 6, 1978. Moro was killed
after 55 days in captivity and the pact collapsed after 10 months.
   Zaccagnini, known by many Italians as ``Zac,'' continued to be
an influential member of the Christian Democrats until his death,
leading a leftist faction of the party.
   Zaccagnini was a doctor, specializing in pediatrics. He served
as a medical officer on the Balkan front from 1941 to 1943 in World
War II.
   Christian Democrat Premier Giulio Andreotti sent a mesagge to
Zaccagnini's widow Anna, recalling ``so many moments of work with
your husband in circumstances that were among the most tragic of
our nation.''
   The current Christian Democrat secretary, Arnaldo Forlani,
described Zaccagnini as ``one of the most exemplary figures of the
Christian Democrats and a clear reference point of our political
life.''
   Communist Party leader Achille Occhetto said, ``His contribution
to our democracy was great.''

<HEAD>Mick Jagger Tours Watsonville Tent Shelter, Meets Quake Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rolling Stones leader Mick Jagger
made a suprise stop at this earthquake ravaged towny to offer
encouragement to its residents who are struggling to slowly rebuild
their lives.
   ``It's a bit hard to take in. It's such a small community,''
said Jagger, who flew in by helicopter Saturday along with rock
promoter Bill Graham two hours before the Stones concert at the
Oakland Coliseum.
   During the performance, Jagger spoke to the audience about the
Oct. 17 quake, saying: ``Our hearts go out to you who suffered from
that. I know that you Northern Californians have an incredible
spirit ... so I don't have to tell you it's a wonderful place to
live.''
   Earlier, as he made an hour-long tour of this agricultural town
of 30,000, the 46-year-old Jagger projected an image far from his
``bad boy'' pose when his band first came to prominence in the '60s.
   He was surrounded by children in tattered clothes and Red Cross
workers when he stepped off a small bus at the Ramsey Park
tent-city, and he nodded gravely while speaking to residents.
   But at one point, Graham picked up 3-year-old Miguel Velasquez,
and handed him to Jagger. Jagger handed the child back, saying,
``I'm not a politician.''
   ``With 1,400 people out of work in the downtown, it affects
everyone else. People don't know quite what they'll do,'' said
Jagger, whose band has pledged $500,000 to be divided between
victims of the earthquake and Hurricane Hugo.
   ``The future depends on how resilient the community is. It's not
a very rich community to start with. That's when it really hurts,''
he said.
   Hundreds of Watsonville residents, including many impoverished
farm workers, were left homeless by the 7.1-magnitude quake, which
killed at least 66 people in Northern California.
   Graham said they chose Watsonville because so much attention had
been focused on San Francisco. Jagger said he toured Managua,
Nicaragua, his former wife's homeland, after its devastating 1972
quake.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega made a
campaign swing Sunday through northern areas where the government
launched a major offensive against rebel forces.
   A day earlier, before thousands of people at Rio Blanco's main
plaza, Ortega presented women who claimed their family members were
killed or missing in Contra attacks. Ortega told the rebels to
``stop being an instrument of the war-like U.S. government policy.''
   Ortega also accused neighboring Honduras of standing in the way
of demobilizing the Contras, who receive non-lethal U.S. aid. The
Honduran government on Saturday offered temporary refuge to Contras
under siege.
   Ortega continued his tour of northern Nicaragua on Sunday.
   Thousands of Sandinista Army troops have searched northern and
southeastern Nicaragua for Contras since Wednesday, when Ortega
announced an end to the leftist government's 19-month cease-fire.
   The pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario reported that the
operation has resulted in 21 rebel deaths. Hospital officials have
reported four injuries among government troops.
   Ortega, in lifting the cease-fire, accused the Contras of
attacking voter registration facilities and innocent civilians in
recent weeks. The Contras denied it.
   The government says 2,000 Contras have infiltrated the country
from Honduras over the past two months.
   Ortega has been nominated for re-election by the ruling
Sandinistas. His main opponent for the Feb. 25, 1990 vote, Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro of the 14-party National Opposition Union, also
is expected to make a campaign stop in Rio Blanco.
   The Contras, who have been fighting to topple the government
since 1981, say the Sandinistas have betrayed the goals of the 1979
popular revolution that toppled President Anastasio Somoza.
   They were supplied with military equipment by the United States,
but the U.S. government now gives them only non-lethal aid.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet military was cut by 235,500 soldiers
this year, and more than 7,000 tanks and 700 airplanes were
withdrawn from Europe under a plan by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Sunday.
   ``The attack capability of Warsaw Pact forces in Central Europe
has diminished,'' reported Pravda.
   Gorbachev in December announced the Soviet Union would within
two years cut its military forces by 500,000 soldiers.
   He also has announced plans to cut Soviet forces in Europe to
move toward an agreement between the Warsaw Pact and North Atlantic
Treaty Organization on conventional weapons.
   But Western experts say the Soviets and their allies in Eastern
Europe still have an overwhelming superiority of many types of
weapons in Europe.
   With Gorbachev's planned troop cuts the Soviet army would still
have an estimated 3.7 million personnel, while the United States
has about 2.1 million in active duty.
   The cuts announced by Pravda included 65,000 officers and more
than 20,000 warrant officers. It did not specify where the cuts
were made.
   Soviet forces in Europe have been reduced by 7,120 tanks, 2,964
artillery pieces and 735 aircraft, the paper said.

<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops gathered in
this city where the first American bishop was named two centuries
ago to grapple with divisive issues of the modern age: AIDS,
abortion and the conflict in the Middle East.
   Leaders of the nation's largest religious denomination also will
elect a new president of the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops at the four-day meeting beginning Monday.
   Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, conference vice
president, is expected to be elevated to the presidency, while nine
other archbishops vie for the vice presidency.
   On Sunday, the bishops held a special bicentennial Mass in the
Basilica of the Assumption, the nation's oldest cathedral, marking
the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the Diocese of
Baltimore and the appointment of the Rev. John Carroll, on Nov. 6,
1789, as the first U.S. Catholic bishop.
   Two centuries later, the agenda before the leaders of the 53
million-member church is rife with the nation's hottest social
issues _ and it's also getting a great deal of attention from the
public as well.
   As the Mass began, about 75 protesters stood outside the church
with picket signs, some pressing for abortion rights, others
supporting the church's anti-abortion stance, and some arguing for
homosexual rights within the church.
   AIDS activists charge that a statement proposed by a bishops'
committee backing off from support of condom education in public
schools as a way of preventing AIDS and teaching chastity instead
may have deadly consequences.
   ``To deny these children this information is abandoning them to
death,'' said Jay Blotcher, a spokesman for the AIDS Coalition to
Unleash Power.
   The bishops' proposed statement attacks condom education as a
``quick-fix'' approach to the AIDS crisis.
   The revised stance came after an earlier document, approved by
the conference's Administrative Board, came under attack for giving
conditional approval to condom education in public schools as long
as sexual abstinence outside of marriage was presented as the only
``medically correct and morally sure way'' to prevent AIDS.
   Some bishops said the original statement would be misinterpreted
as condoning extramarital sex and artificial birth control.
   Another draft statement by the Ad Hoc Committee on the Middle
East has drawn criticism from several Jewish groups for its
proposal that Israel negotiate directly with Palestinians over
``territory and sovereignty.''
   ``It is our conviction that a truly open moment for peace exists
in the Middle East,'' said the committee's members, Archbishop
Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, Cardinal John O'Connor of New York and
Archbishop William Keeler of Baltimore.
   But some Jewish groups charge the bishops' statement offers
``premature'' support for a sovereign Palestinian homeland.
   ``Hope for progress rests on getting the parties together
without predetermined results,'' said the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith, which said the proposal in effect calls for a
Palestinian state.
   In another proposed resolution, the bishops call upon Catholics
to give ``urgent attention and priority'' to the abortion issue
following the recent Supreme Court decision allowing states to set
new limits on abortion.
   ``At this particular time, abortion has become the fundamental
human rights issue for all men and women of good will,'' the
resolution states.
   With church custom dictating that Pilarczyk will succeed
Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis as president of the bishop's
conference, interest has turned toward the vice-presidential
election.
   Candidates are Archbishop Anthony J. Bevilacqua of Philadelphia;
Keeler; Mahony; Archbishop Eugene A. Marino of Atlanta; Archbishop
Theodore E. McCarrick of Newark, N.J.; Archbishop J. Francis
Stafford of Denver; Archbishop Oscar H. Lipscomb of Mobile, Ala.;
Archbishop Daniel W. Kucera of Dubuque, Iowa; and Archbishop Thomas
C. Kelly of Louisville, Ky.
   Among other issues, the nation's approximately 300 bishops are
being asked to endorse the National Black Catholic Pastoral Plan,
which calls for broad-based participation in the church by the
nation's estimated 2 million black Catholics. A severe clergy
shortage also has prompted the Bishop's Committee on the Liturgy to
submit a proposed ``Order for Sunday Celebrations in the Absence of
a Priest.''
   In conjunction with the Baltimore bicentennial, the Vatican lent
the Walters Art Gallery here a collection of priceless religious
items given to or commissioned by medieval, Renaissance and Baroque
popes.
   Included in the exhibit, which opened Sunday, is a gold enameled
reliquary cross said to have held pieces of the cross on which
Christ died, several illuninated manuscripts and two tapestries
designed by the Renaissance painter Raphael.

   An East German Cabinet minister on Sunday called
for the resignation of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo.
Another minister announced that East Germans will be allowed to
travel in the West for 30 days a year under a new law.
   The state-run news agency ADN quoted Culture Minister
Hans-Joachim Hoffmann as saying: ``We need as quickly as possible a
new government.''
   He said the entire Politburo should jointly resign ``to give the
new general secretary a real chance,'' ADN reported.
   The general secretary is Egon Krenz, leader of the Communist
Party who took over Oct. 18 after Erich Honecker was ousted. Krenz
said Friday that five elderly members of the 21-member Politburo
will step down soon.
   Two Poliburo members already have been ousted, in the shake-up
that ended Honecker's rule. They were closely associated with the
former leader's strict 18-year rule.
   Hoffmann also called for the 42-member Cabinet to be
streamlined. He made his comments during a meeting with citizens in
the city of Leipzig, which has been the site of major pro-democracy
demonstrations in recent weeks.
   ADN said tens of thousands of citizens took part in similar
meetings around the country between officials and citizens.
   The talks were initiated last week by Krenz as part of his
effort to stop an exodus of East Germans to the West.
   Most of those leaving have cited dissatisfaction with the
hard-line government here and the lack of freedom to travel out of
the country.
   Interior Minister Friedrich Dickel, speaking on state-run
television news, said a new travel law will allow all East German
citizens to receive passports to travel to the West for up to 30
days a year.
   Dickel said he expected the law would be go into force by the
end of the year. He said the draft law would be published in the
media Monday.
   ``We want to give the possibility to all citizens to travel
wherever they want without any restrictions,'' Dickel said.
   He said passport applications would be handled in 30 days, with
urgent cases settled in three days or less.
   Dickel said applications for emigration would be processed
within three to six months and indicated that illegal stays in the
West would be decriminalized.
   East Germany now strictly regulates the number of people who can
visit the West and makes it extremely difficult for those without
relatives in the West to obtain permission.
   Despite the ouster of Honecker and signs that Krenz is open to
reform, thousands of East Germans continued to flee their country
Sunday, taking advantage of the opportunity to pass freely through
neighboring Czechoslovakia en route to West Germany, where they
receive automatic citizenship.
   West German border officials said at least 15,000 East Germans
had arrived in West Germany between Friday, when the route was
opened, and Sunday.
   In East Berlin, a sign prominently displayed outside City Hall
on Sunday said: ``The Communist Party is driving the citizens out
of the country.''
   Also Sunday, ADN reported that the Communist Party leader for
the region of Leipzig resigned for ``health reasons.''
   Roland Woetzel was elected to replace Horst Schumann, whom ADN
said headed the region's party leadership for 19 years.
   Leipzig's Communist mayor, Bernd Seidel, resigned Friday.
   Four of the country's 15 regional party chiefs have been
replaced since Thursday.

   Troops dispersed about 100
Americans who prayed with Arabs Sunday and had held a sit-in in a
West Bank town where residents refused to pay taxes in solidarity
with the Palestinian uprising.
   Elsewhere, Arab assailants stabbed two Israelis and seven
Palestinians were injured in clashes with security forces,
including a teen-ager shot by border police after a chase through
the market streets of Bethlehem.
   A 19-year-old Palestinian died of wounds suffered Friday.
   The death of Mufied Jamil Huzboon brought to 610 the number of
Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the
23-month-old uprising. Forty Israelis have also been killed in the
violence.
   The army said soldiers shot the youth in the West Bank town of
Jenin after he ignored orders to stop. It said Huzboon was wanted
for firebomb attacks and assaults on alleged Arab informants.
   In the West Bank town of Beit Sahour, about 6,000 Christian and
Moslem Arabs were joined by about 100 U.S. supporters for prayer
services in churches and mosques.
   The American group included activists from pro-Palestinian and
human rights organizations in 25 states, participants said.
   Last week, the army lifted a six-week blockade of Beit Sahour.
During the six months cars, television sets and other property were
seized in an effort to break a Palestinian tax boycott.
   Overseen by hundreds of Israeli paratroopers, protesters in Beit
Sahour also staged a roadside service and a march, waving outlawed
Palestinian flags and signs that read: ``No taxation under
occupation.''
   Israeli peace activists and journalists were kept out of the
town.
   Tom Martin, a protester from Washington, D.C., said 36 Americans
sat in front of army jeeps and several refused demands by troops to
leave.
   Dan Van Hoeven, a Protestant minister from Kalamazoo, Mich.,
said he was pushed and dragged by soldiers after refusing to move.
Brian Smith, a student from Chicago, said he was slapped by a
soldier.
   An army spokeswoman said troops intervened when the protesters
``staged a sit-in on the road after the prayers. Soldiers dispersed
them without force and arrests.''
   The American group later issued a statement protesting alleged
army violations of legal and human rights in Beit Sahour.
   In Jerusalem, two Palestinian youths stabbed New York-born
Avraham Feld, 35, with a screwdriver. Jerusalem Police Chief Arye
Bibi said several suspects were detained. Hadassah Hospital
spokeswoman Orna Cohen said Feld suffered a chest wound.
   Two Arabs stabbed a Druse Arab border policeman inside a
bathroom at a Tel Aviv bus station, slightly wounding him in the
arms, police spokeswoman Dalia Gilad said.
   In Bethlehem, four border policemen chased four youths after the
youths hurled stones at troops. A policeman chased one youth down a
side street and shot at him, witnesses reported. They said the
youth fell to the ground, bloodied and clutching his stomach.
   Police refused to let onlookers take the youth to a hospital and
dispersed the crowd by firing in the air. Officers took the wounded
youth away in a jeep.
   The military command said he was among a group of masked
Palestinians who were building a stone barricade and ignored orders
to stop. A spokeswoman said the youth was wounded in the buttocks.

   Seventeen people who received letters
telling them they had won a free dinner and lottery tickets were
arrested on outstanding warrants when they showed up to claim their
prize.
   ``They were shocked, they were stunned,'' said Michael Goodwin,

``They weren't believing it because this looked so real.''
   The 17 were among 575 people wanted on outstanding warrants. The
letters said the recipients had won a dinner for two at a fictional
restaurant and 50 lottery tickets.
   The ``winners'' were told to collect their prizes Saturday at
the Western Marketing Research office. When they arrived, they were
greeted by a secretary who said the letters had to be verified.
   ``When the warrant was verified I said, `Good, we're in
business. Come on back, we've got a couple of papers to sign and
we'll have you out of here in a couple of minutes,' which was the
truth,'' said police officer Terry Seal.
   Ten were arrested on outstanding felony warrants and the rest
were arrested on misdemeanor warrants.

<TEXT>
   This small town has gained a distinction it
would just as soon not hold: the thirstiest community in Kansas.
   Figures compiled by the state showed that in 1987 each of
Rolla's 423 residents used an average of 626 gallons of water a
day, compared with the per-person 139 gallons-a-day average
statewide.
   The 1988 estimates had Rolla residents using 599 gallons per
person, every day.
   ``There's no way we can be using that much water,'' said Rachael
Stewart, a nutritionist in the southwest Kansas city, which gets
only 16 or 17 inches of rain a year. ``When they told us that, I
didn't know whether to start rationing water, or go home and see if
I could actually use that much.''
   But since Rolla is one of about a dozen Kansas towns without
water meters, individual usage can't be measured. City Clerk
Dorothy Banker figures water bills based on lot size and number of
lines to a residence. Most folks pay $15.85 a month, regardless of
how much water they use.
   Places that don't meter water tend to use 50 percent to 70
percent more water a day than cities that charge according to use,
says the Kansas Water Office and the Division of Water Resources.
   ``This is the first year they sent my water report back, and
just flat said, `Justify this,''' said Banker.
   There is no penalty, just embarrassment, for topping the water
usage list.
   ``We do realize we have a problem, and we have taken steps to
alleviate it,'' said Kurt Waldo, Rolla's combined city manager,
chief of police and public works superintendent.
   A voluntary plan restricting lawn watering to every other day
was put in place in May and has shown some positive results, Waldo
said. ``We got people in the habit of turning the water off,
instead of just letting it run.''
   Average per capita consumption dropped from 793 gallons a day in
April to 399 gallons in June, thanks in part to some timely rains,
Waldo said.

   Students pitched in with 114,000 old phone
books at Directory Games, a competition to reach out and bring back
the used paper for recycling.
   Two weeks remain to reach Project ReDirectory's goal of 120,000
phone books, which will be recycled into tissue and other paper
products.
   Most of the old directories were collected since Southwestern
Bell began distributing new directories Oct. 23.
   Roosevelt Elementary School won first prize of $300 at the
Directory Games on Saturday, bringing in nearly 62 tons. Jane
Longan, a teacher at Roosevelt, said students located most of the
old directories at hospitals.
   ``There were books that had never been used,'' Ms. Longan said.
   She said the effort gave students a sense of ``togetherness,''
but the victory had its less-than-glamourous moments.
   ``The worst part was loading,'' she said. Teachers, parents,
students and secretaries spent nearly all day Friday heaving the
books onto a tractor-trailer.
   Southwestern Bell spokesman Wayne Campbell said 120,000 books
would be equivalent to one-fourth of the directories distributed
last year.
   If the Tulsa project is successful, Southwestern Bell will plan
to make the same effort in Oklahoma City next year when new
directories are distributed there, Campbell said.

over the weekend to remember shipmates who died 45 years apart.
   The Blue Ghost Association of former crew members originally
planned its reunion to coincide with the 45th anniversary Sunday of
the day a Japanese suicide plane hit the carrier and killed 47
shipmates.
   But the heartache and horror of the wartime losses were recalled
Oct. 29 when a T-2 Buckeye training jet crashed into the Lexington.
The crash killed the Navy pilot and four people on the flight deck.
   On Sunday, a Navy chaplain offered prayers during shipboard
services to console crew members.
   The ship, now used exclusively to train naval aviators, was
given the nickname Blue Ghost during the war because Japanese
propagandist Tokyo Rose reported it sunk several times, only to
have it reappear in its unusual, uncamouflaged blue-gray paint.
   During a day cruise Saturday that was part of the reunion plans,
sailors from two eras dropped a pair of wreaths in the Gulf of
Mexico about 10 miles from where the trainer crash occurred.
   ``It's ironic,'' said Roland King of Westfield, Mass., president
of the assocation, after he and the group's vice president, Charles
Ryberg of Waltham, Mass., dropped one of the wreaths into the sea.
   About 1,500 guests, including family members of the 1,400
present and former crew members, crowded onto the ship's flight
deck to watch demonstration flights by various Navy aircraft and a
fly-over by five T-2s. One of the training jets peeled off to leave
the other four in a missing-man formation.
   The wreaths then were dropped overboard by the former crew
members and the ship's present skipper, Capt. C. Flack Logan.
   Ryberg said his thoughts during the ceremony turned to three
buddies he lost in the kamikaze attack and to the Lexington's
skipper at the time, Capt. Ernest Wheeler Litch.
   ``When we were hit that day ... I had a chance to be up near the
bridge (and) then-Captain Litch,'' Ryberg said. ``He was looking up
and there were tears coming down (from) his eyes.''
   Ryberg said he knew Logan must have felt the same way after the
crash.
   ``They are the captains and they bleed inside,'' Ryberg said.
``This captain here (Logan) bled that day for those people.''

<HEAD>Worth Of Drugs Seized in NYC Raid Could Reach $1 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY NEUMEISTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The street value of the city's largest drug
seizure could reach nearly $1 billion by the time federal agents
finish digging cocaine from hundreds of drums in a warehouse, a
drug agent said Sunday.
   The work, which began with the raid of the two-story warehouse
late Friday, was suspended Sunday because of the New York Marathon,
which runs past the building's doors in the borough of Queens.
   Police officers and firefighters were to resume assisting agents
from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Customs Service on
Monday in recovering the cocaine, which was buried beneath a
caustic powder inside drums marked poison.
   Drug smugglers apparently hoped the powder, which can open
clogged drains and cause skin burns and lung damage, would keep
authorities from detecting the cocaine.
   ``It just shows us how innovative the drug traffickers are,''
DEA agent Mary Cooper said.
   Police had searched two-thirds of the 252 drums by late Saturday
and uncovered 8,800 pounds of cocaine worth about $700 million on
the street, Cooper said. Agents expect to find a total of up to
12,000 pounds _ 6 tons _ of cocaine worth up to $1 billion, she
said.
   ``At this time, the seizure appears to be in the top five
nationwide,'' Cooper said.
   It was the latest in a series of large seizures. On Sept. 29,
agents found 21.4 tons of cocaine in an unguarded warehouse in the
San Fernando Valley near Los Angeles. Six days later, authorities
discovered 9 tons of cocaine in a house in Harlingen, Texas, and
about 6 tons on a Panamanian ship in the Gulf of Mexico.
   No arrests had occurred by midday Sunday in connection with the
New York raid, which was prompted by an anonymous tip to the
Brooklyn district attorney's office.
   The drugs were believed to be the property of the Cali cartel,
one of Colombia's largest cocaine distributors.
   Newsweek magazine, in its Nov. 5 issue, said Cali and other
major cartels, content in the past to distribute drugs through U.S.
middlemen, now are distributing cocaine directly in this country to
boost their profits.
   The magazine also said the cartels' combined gross revenues are
estimated as high as $5 billion a year.
   Cooper said the seizure would not affect sales of cocaine on New
York streets for at least six months, if at all.

<HEAD>California Legislature Completes Work on Quake Relief Package</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators wrapped up work over the
weekend on an $800 million earthquake relief package, approving a
temporary quarter-cent sales tax increase which Gov. George
Deukmejian said he would sign Monday.
   The governor, meanwhile, announced the appointment of a panel of
earthquake and engineering experts to investigate why sections of
Interstate 880 and the Bay Bridge collapsed.
   ``We also need to know whether these failures were, or could
have been predicted,'' Deukmejian said in his weekend statewide
radio address.
   The Republican governor will sign the bills Monday during a
visit to San Francisco, said spokeswoman Susie Trowbridge.
   Several Northern California legislators predicted that a
13-month, quarter-cent increase in the sales tax won' t be enough.
The tax will raise an estimated $800 million. The governor's office
also plans to tap the state reserve for $200 million.
   Those lawmakers, while lacking numbers to support their
arguments, insisted the cost of the earthquake repairs will be much
higher than the total $4.25 billion in approved federal aid and
state funds.
   ``It's going to be closer to $10 billion, believe me,'' said
Sen. Nick Petris, who urged a half-cent sales tax increase. ``This
is no time to be pandering to the pockets of the people.''
   The tax hike, opposed by most Republicans in the Assembly,
passed the lower house Saturday with only two votes to spare. It
passed the Senate on a 34-2 vote.
   ``Why would anyone want to take advantage of this disaster to
raise taxes?'' asked Assemblyman Pat Nolan, one of a group of
conservative Republicans who tried to block the tax.
   But Deukmejian, who drafted the 12-point relief package with
legislative leaders, said the funds combined with federal aid
should ``provide the necessary resources in order to restore some
semblance of normalcy in the Bay area.''
   Lawmakers recessed their special earthquake session Saturday
evening, postponing action until January on more than 90 other
earthquake-related measures introduced this week.
   California's statewide sales tax is currently 6 percent,
although the tax is as high as 7 percent in parts of the state
where local voters have approved higher levies.
   The tax will aid rebuilding from the 7.1 magnitude quake, which
struck Northern California on Oct. 17, killing 66 people and
injuring more than 3,000. State authorities have estimated the
damages at more than $7 billion, including some $1.7 billion to
state and county roads.
   One quake-related bill in the governor's package approved
Saturday would supply $19.4 million in grants to quake victims.
Other bills would earmark money to strengthen roads and bridges,
give immediate aid to people displaced by the quake and provide tax
breaks for owners of quake-damaged property.
   A mild aftershock struck the San Francisco Bay area Sunday
morning.
   Pat Jorgenson, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Geological Survey,
said the aftershock hit at 5:37 a.m. and measured 4.0 on the
Richter scale, according to a preliminary calculation. The
seismographic station at the University of California at Berkeley
estimated the strength at 4.2 on the scale.
   The quake occurred on the San Andreas fault and the epicenter
was in the area of Loma Prieta mountain, located about 8 miles
northeast of Santa Cruz, Ms. Jorgenson said.
   There were no reports of damage or injuries. A 4.0 Richter quake
is capable of moderate damage near the center.
   Meanwhile, Hispanic leaders and U.S. Rep. Leon Panetta over the
weekend blasted federal officials, saying they have ignored the
needs of the many Spanish-speaking people left homeless by the
quake.
   ``There is a Spanish population here that needs special
attention: it demands some sensitivy,'' the Democratic
representative from Monterey said during a Saturday meeting in
Santa Cruz.
   The meeting brought together federal, state and local agencies
working on earthquake relief programs.
   FEMA official Bob Stevens told the task force that the agency
ran out of Spanish-language applications while serving disaster
victims in Puerto Rico.
   Mick Jagger, lead singer of the Rolling Stones, made a surprise
stop at Watsonville's ravaged downtown and a tent-city for quake
victims before flying by helicopter back to Oakland for his Steel
Wheels concert tour Saturday.
   ``It's a bit hard to take in. It's such a small community,''
said Jagger, who flew in along with rock promoter Bill Graham two
hours before the Stones concert at the Oakland Coliseum.
   ``With 1,400 people out of work in the downtown, it affects
everyone else. People don't know quite what they'll do,'' said
Jagger, whose band has pledged $500,000 to be divided between
victims of the quake and Hurricane Hugo.

<HEAD>Wife of Rebel Officer Says He and Others Killed by Military</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel officers who tried to oust Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega last month and surrendered after they failed
were killed, according to the wife of one of the leaders of the
attempted coup.
   The accusation was made in a clandestine television broadcast by
Adela de Giroldi, the wife of Maj. Moises Giroldi.
   The broadcast was transmitted for 25 minutes on channel 12, a
channel unused by any of the five television stations in Panama.
   Sunday morning various radio broadcasts were interrupted by
clandestine signals telling listeners to watch channel 12.
   Mrs. Giroldi fled to Miami as did some relatives of other rebels.
   ``I feel proud of my husband and that he died with honor,'' Mrs.
Giroldi said.
   ``They lined up my husband and the others to kill them in cold
blood because they surrendered, and without any thought they were
murdered. To those they don't like, death. To those they like,
death. And to those they don't understand, death.''
   ``Gen. Noriega is capable of any madness, of anything,'' she
said.
   Twenty-seven officers were arrested after the Oct. 3 revolt
against Noriega, who controls the government as the head of
Panama's Defense Forces. Eight rebel soldiers were killed when
Noriega loyalists crushed the attempted coup.
   The government has denied earlier reports that some of the
rebels officers were executed after surrendering.
   Mrs. Giroldi said of Noriega, ``He is not in a condition to run
the country or the Defense Forces. There are still good and honest
officers who could command the Defense Forces well.''
   She said Noriega is ``not fighting for nationalism, he's
fighting for his own territory, his survival.''
   Noriega has shuffled leadership posts in the Defense Forces.
Some officers close to him were involved in the uprising. Noriega
has accused the United States of trying to infiltrate the military,
encouraging young officers to overthrow the general.
   Washington has been putting pressure on Noriega to resign since
he was indicted on drug charges last year by two grand juries in
Florida. Noriega has said the accusations are false and were made
by the United States as an excuse to abrogate the Panama Canal
Treaties. The treaties turn control of the waterway over to Panama
before the end of the century.
   There was no indication where the signal on channel 12 came from
or who was responsibile. The government did not comment on the
broadcast.
   Kurt Frederick Muse, a 39-year-old U.S. citizen, was arrested in
April and accused of making clandestine broadcasts. Panama accused
the U.S. government of giving Muse the equipment necessary for the
operation.
   It was not known if Muse is still in custody.

<TEXT>
   Lebanese lawmakers elected a new
Christian president Sunday and approved a peace plan designed to
end 14 years of civil war, despite threats by a Christian general
to punish them for ``conspiracy.''
   The legislators elected Deputy Rene Mouawad, a 32-year veteran
of Lebanese politics and a 64-year-old Maronite Christian, to be
president. They first stripped the presidency of some power, giving
more authority to Moslems who would fill other top government posts.
   Fifty-eight of Parliament's 73 surviving lawmakers attended the
special session in this northern town, which is under Syrian
security. On the second ballot 52 voted for Mouawad and six
abstained.
   Lebanon has had no president since Sept. 22, 1988, when
President Amin Gemayel's six-year term expired with Parliament
unable to decide on a successor.
   The legislators also re-elected Parliament Speaker Hussein
Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, for a one-year term. He has held the
post since October 1984.
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun, whom Gemayel appointed to
head an interim Cabinet until a new president could be named,
rejected Mouawad's election.
   ``What happened in Kleiat is an unconstitutional act and is null
and void,'' Aoun said in a statement issued from his command bunker
at the presidential palace in Beirut's suburb of Baabda.
   ``We are determined to thwart the conspiracy which is being
hatched to eliminate what is left of Lebanon's sovereignty and
territorial integrity,'' he said.
   Aoun rejected the Arab League-brokered peace plan, first
approved by the lawmakers at a session last month in Saudi Arabia,
because it failed to guarantee a withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian
troops who control much of Lebanon.
   He considers the Syrians an occupying army and fought them for
six months until a Sept. 22 cease-fire called by the Arab League.
Police say 930 people were killed and 2,744 wounded, most of them
civilians, in fierce artillery battles.
   The general declared Saturday that he had dissolved Parliament.
Most legislators declared his move illegal, noting that under
Lebanon's constitution, only the president can dissolve Parliament.
   Aoun has called the legislators traitors and threatened to
punish them for approving the accord without his consent.
   Syria was the first foreign country to react to the election of
Mouawad, whose first priority is to form a national reconciliation
government to end the civil war.
   An official source in Damascus, Syria, quoted President Hafez
Assad as saying: ``I am most glad to address to you my hearty
congratulations. ... What was achieved today is a great
accomplishment on the way to end Lebanon's long ordeal.''
   In Washington, President Bush welcomed Mouawad's election and
urged Aoun and other Lebanese to back his efforts to end the civil
war. The State Department asked all parties ``to refrain from
violence and intimidation and aid President Mouawad in reunifying
Lebanon.''
   France praised the decision and urged the Lebanese to ``write a
new page in their history.'' In Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, King Fahd
expressed his ``extreme joy'' at the election and appealed to the
world community to help rebuild Lebanon.
   The new president, the ninth since Lebanon's independence from
France in 1943, was immediately sworn in, underscoring Parliament's
desire to start the process of reunifying the country as quickly as
possible.
   The unanimously approved peace plan stripped the Christian
president of some power to give the prime minister and Parliament
speaker, both Moslems, a wider share in decision making.
   The peace plan shifts political power to the Moslem majority
from the Christians, who were believed to be in the majority when
the existing political system was devised in the 1940s.
   The 58 parliamentarians were nine more than the quorum of 49
needed to elect a president.
   In a first ballot, Mouawad got 35 votes, short of the 49 he
needed. Two other parliamentarians running for the top post, George
Saadeh and Elias Hrawi, withdrew after the first round.
   Acting prime minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who headed a
Syrian-backed Cabinet that competed for legitimacy with Aoun for
the past 13 months, submitted his resignation to the new president
to facilitate appointment of a new premier.
   ``This election is a triumph for a unified Lebanon and a promise
of a better furture,'' Hoss said in a statement broadcast by Moslem
radio stations.
   ``From the eerie smell of cordite, we are watching a new Lebanon
rising from the ashes of the civil war,'' said an announcer over
Channel 7, the Moslem-run television station, as the session got
under way.

   Snow and gusty winds whipped the eastern slopes of the central
Rockies on Sunday and 7 inches of snow blanketed northern
Minnesota, but most of the nation enjoyed tranquil weather.
   Snow began falling on parts of northern Minnesota Saturday
evening and early Sunday morning. It was heaviest in northeast
Minnesota, with 7 inches reported at Baudette.
   A low pressure system was producing light showers early Sunday
afternoon from eastern South Dakota and northeastern Nebraska
across southern Minnesota and northern Iowa into west-central
Wisconsin.
   Light rain fell on parts of eastern Wisconsin and upper
Michigan. Parts of North Dakota also reported light snow and snow
showers.
   Strong and gusty winds continued to whip through some of the
higher elevations of Colorado and Wyoming. Winds at the summit of
Squaw Mountain, west of Denver, hit 55 mph at sunrise.
   Temperatures were in the 70s Sunday across much of the
southeastern quarter of the nation, with readings in the 80s across

   Fort Worth, Texas, tied its high temperature record Sunday with
a reading of 85 degrees. San Angelo, Texas, also tied its high with
a reading of 86 degrees.
   Temperatures were in the 70s in southern Arizona and southern
California. Readings were in the 30s across much of North Dakota,

   A generation after Medgar Evers and
Martin Luther King Jr. were killed, the nation's first memorial to
martyrs of the civil rights movement was dedicated Sunday as
relatives expressed hope that young people will carry on the spirit
of that turbulent era.
   Several people cried as they touched the cool water that flows
across a circular black granite slab engraved with important events
of the era, including the names of 40 people who died in the
struggle for racial equality.
   The memorial is of the same material and by the same architect
as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington.
   ``I hope this will vitalize the struggle, keep it fresh in the
minds ... for the youth,'' said Ollie Gordon, a Chicago
schoolteacher whose cousin, 14-year-old Emmett Till, was shot to
death in 1955 by whites angered that he had spoken to a white woman.
   ``I talk about Martin Luther King and ask why we celebrate his
birthday, and many children don't know,'' Ms. Gordon said.
   More than 400 law enforcement officers provided security for the
dedication ceremony, which was held without incident. A Ku Klux
Klansman from Georgia tried to get a police permit to lead a
demonstration, but he was blocked by the city and a federal judge.
   Speakers at the ceremony included Rosa Parks, whose refusal to
give up her seat to a white man sparked the Montgomery bus boycott
of 1955-56, and relatives of those honored on the monument,
including Martin Luther King III.
   ``The struggle is not over yet,'' the son of the civil rights
leader told a crowd estimated by police at between 5,000 and 6,000.
``Something is wrong in a nation that doesn't set its priorities to
take care of all its people.''
   Relatives viewed the monument before the dedication which ended
with thousands joining hands to sing ``We Shall Overcome.''
   ``It's a very moving experience,'' said Myrlie Evers of Los
Angeles, whose husband, Medgar, was the highest-ranking NAACP
officer in Mississippi when he was assassinated in 1963. ``It says
to me that there's hope.''
   Julian Bond, the first black state lawmaker in Georgia, said it
was important to remember others besides King and Evers who died in
the struggle.
   ``Without degradating Dr. King, this was a lot more than a
Martin Luther King movement,'' he said. ``Many were ordinary,
everyday people who rose above their ordinariness to make a
difference.''
   The $700,000 monument also honors James Chaney, Andrew Goodman
and Michael Schwerner, who were shot to death during the 1964
Freedom Summer and whose slayings inspired the recent movie
``Mississippi Burning.''
   ``Poetry in granite'' was how Goodman's mother, Carolyn Goodman
of New York City, described the memorial designed by Maya Lin.
   ``Nobody who sees it cannot feel that it's a moving, moving
piece of art,'' Ms. Goodman said. ``It brings that period so
vividly alive that you can almost relive it.''
   The monument is in front of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a
few blocks from the Alabama Capitol, where Jefferson Davis took the
oath of office as president of the Confederacy in 1861, and near
the Baptist church where King launched the Montgomery bus boycott
in 1955.
   The 9-foot-high granite wall is inscribed with words from the
Bible that King chose for his first speech during the bus boycott:
``Until justice rolls down like water and righteousness like a
mighty stream.''
   King, a county commissioner in Atlanta, said he thought his
father's words were ``very appropriate.''
   He said the memorial focuses attention on inequalities that
still exist and will serve as a hands-on history lesson for young
people.
   ``Perhaps they can get an understanding of why people lost their
lives,'' King said.
   Also at the ceremony was his father's top lieutenant, the Rev.
Ralph David Abernathy, who has been scorned by many black leaders
because of his recent book, which portrays the elder King as having
a weakness for women.
   The two shook hands and spoke briefly after the ceremony.
   ``He expressed the fact that he was hurt,'' said Abernathy. ``I
told him that I love him and he'll understand someday, hopefully.''
   Abernathy joined hands with others on the podium at the end of
the ceremony to sing ``We Shall Overcome.''
   Afterward, the law center criticized Abernathy's actions, saying
he was not asked to sit on the podium or make any remarks. ``His
ploy was simply a cheap effort to bring himself back into the fold
of the civil rights movement after selling out its most honored
hero,'' the statement said.
   The law center published a 104-page magazine that tells the
story of each person named on the monument, and copies were sent to
schools around the country.
   Mamie Till Mobley of Chicago, Emmett Till's mother, said she
hoped the memorial would be an ``awakening'' for youngsters too
young to remember when whites and blacks were forced to drink from
separate water fountains.
   ``It shows you that you don't have to be great, just be the best
you can be,'' she said. ``It doesn't take shakers and movers to
make changes. Everybody can do it.''

   Democrat David Dinkins clashed in campaign debate with New York
mayoral rival Rudolph Giuliani on Sunday while gubernatorial
contenders sought support in Virginia and New Jersey in the final
days of an off-year election season focusing on race and abortion.
   Weekend polls pointed to a possible Democratic sweep on Tuesday
in the three most closely watched races _ L. Douglas Wilder of
Virginia in his bid to become the nation's first elected black
governor, Dinkins in his drive to become his city's first black
mayor and Rep. James Florio in New Jersey.
   Democratic chairman Ron Brown hailed the surveys as evidence his
party was ``moving in a new direction'' after losing last year's
presidential campaign and is able to reach voters ``in the middle
of the political spectrum.''
   GOP chairman Lee Atwater said ``I'm not going to concede
anything'' that would suggest he anticipated defeat for Giuliani,
Rep. James Courter in New Jersey or J. Marshall Coleman in
Virginia. He noted that President Bush overcame unfavorable polls
to win a pivotal Republican primary election last year on his way
to the White House.
   Atwater said no matter the outcome, this year's campaign would
portend little for 1990, when 34 Senate seats, 36 governorships and
435 House seats are on the ballot.
   On the volatile abortion issue, Atwater said, ``We're trying to
be the majority party, and we're big enough party to have differing
viewpoints on all issues, and specifically, abortion.'' He and
Brown were interviewed on ABC's ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   The underdog Republicans in the big races in New York, Virginia
and New Jersey all have been thrown on the defensive by their
pro-choice opponents on the issue of abortion. The subject has
emerged as a potent issue in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling
last summer permitting tougher restrictions.
   In comments underscoring the importance of race, Brown said
Dinkins and Wilder would become leaders of ``national status'' if
they win. But he also said their fortunes would have little to do
with the future of Jesse Jackson, far and away the nation's best
known black politician.
   The off-year ballot was crowded with hundreds of city hall, city
council, and other local races as well as dozens of referendums
from Maine to California.
   Detroit's 71-year-old Mayor Coleman Young hoped to hold off an
unexpectedly strong challenge from 40-year-old rival Tom Barrow.
Cleveland City Council President George Forbes was running against
state Sen. Michael R. White in a particularly bruising fight to
pick that city's next mayor.
   In Seattle, Norm Rice is favored to become the city's first
black mayor, while state Sen. John Daniels is heavily favored to
become the first black mayor of New Haven, Conn., which is 70
percent white.
   In Texas, 11 candidates are on the ballot to fill the unexpired
term of the late Rep. Mickey Leland, killed in an airplane crash in
Ethiopia.
   But the national attention was focused on Virginia, New York and
New Jersey, where abortion, race, local issues and negative
campaign commercials proved to be a combustible mix.
   Wilder, buoyed by a Richmond Times-Dispatch poll reporting a
nine-point bulge, campaigned Sunday in the state's coal mining
region. He told voters of the region's crucial role in his upset
victory in the 1985 race for lieutenant governor.
   ``If my campaign had failed in southwest Virginia in '85, I
wouldn't be standing here as the gubernatorial nominee,'' Wilder
told a rally in Grundy. ``In '85, you gave me a start.''
   Coleman was in northwestern part of the state to conclude a
weekend in which he charged his rival with privately pledging to
coal miners he would ``sabotage'' the state's right-to-work law by
permitting unions to collect dues from nonunion workers covered by
union contracts. Wilder says he supports the right-to-work law.
   ``It's not in the bag,'' Coleman told supporters at a picnic in
Front Royal. ``We're coming around the corner. ... The undecided
are going our way overwhelmingly.''
   Race had largely been an unspoken issue in their campaign until
late week, when Coleman said Wilder was benefiting from a ``double
standard'' in press coverage.
   Wilder replied Saturday by appearing with housewife Marie Moran,
who said she had intended to vote for Coleman, but was switching
because of his comment about press coverage. ``It's time for
Virginia to have a black governor,'' she said.
   The Dinkins-Giuliani debate was their second in less than 24
hours, and came as a new public opinion poll reported a 54-38
advantage for the Democrat.
   ``I think the people of this town want a mayor who has nothing
to fear from a prosecutor,'' former U.S. attorney Giuliani said of
his rival, who concedes he failed to file income tax returns 20
years ago and has been dogged about questions of a stock transfer
to his son. Giuliani told reporters after the debate that Dinkins
``needs to be investigated.''
   But Dinkins accused his opponent of ``distortions and
complaints'' and said he had put the stock and tax questions to
rest. He noted that three of the city's four daily papers have
endorsed him and said of Giuliani, ``If he's the greatest thing
since sliced bread as he argues, why is it that they haven't turned
to him?''
   Florio, buoyed by a poll showing him with a lead of 24 points,
called for the election of Democratic candidates to the State
Assembly, where Republicans have a two-seat majority. ``Unless I
have people in the Assembly that are philosophically in line with
what I've been talking about, then I'm going to have a mission to
carry out with one hand tied behind my back,'' he said.
   Courter dismissed the Star Ledger-Eagleton poll as he made his
way around the state. In an appearance on the Brinkley program he
accused Florio of running a campaign of ``scurrilous ads'' designed
to obscure his views on possible tax increases and other issues.

   A crowd of people chanting ``Cory! Cory!''
greeted President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines on her way to
Mass Sunday, the second day of her eight-day visit to Canada and
the United States.
   Mrs. Aquino came to Toronto from Vancouver where she arrived
Saturday to begin the trip, aimed at spurring foreign investment
and commitments to help relieve the country's $28 billion foreign
debt.
   Mrs. Aquino waved to the crowd of 2,000 outside St. Michael's
Roman Catholic Cathedral.
   On Monday she will meet Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in Ottawa.
Mrs. Aquino's press secretary, Adolfo Azcuna, said among several
agreements expected to be signed is a $56 million Canadian aid
package for social and public works projects.
   Canadian two-way trade with the Philippines reached about $189
million last year, but total Canadian investment in the country is
only $36 million, Azcuna said.
   Larry Kent, a spokesman for the Canadian government, said
security was tightened for Mrs. Aquino's arrival. He did not
elaborate.
   Mrs. Aquino, 56, was swept to power in a 1986 military-civilian
uprising that ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.

   Sounding confident of a historic victory in
the governor's race, Democrat L. Douglas Wilder on Sunday worked
Virginia's coal territory seeking the same boost that gave him his
first statewide office four years ago.
   Republican J. Marshall Coleman campaigned in the northern
Shenandoah Valley and in Colonial Heights near Richmond, telling
supporters the election is ``not in the bag'' despite Wilder's
consistent lead in the polls.
   Wilder, who is trying to become the nation's first elected black
governor, led Coleman by 9 percentage points in a Richmond
Times-Dispatch poll published Sunday. Nineteen percent of those
surveyed were undecided.
   Recent polls have shown Wilder with a lead of 4 to 15 percentage
points.
   Continuing a weekend swing through the state's southwestern
mountains, Wilder said he relied on strong support in the
coal-mining region for his successful campaign for lieutenant
governor in 1985.
   ``The kinds of encouragement you gave made it possible for me to
carry it on from county to county and from city to city,'' Wilder
told supporters in the town of Ben Hur.
   In the town of Honaker, Wilder addressed a crowd that included a
few dozen United Mine Workers members who have been on strike
against Pittson Coal Group Inc. for seven months.
   ``No one wants to see that matter settled more than this
person,'' Wilder said.
   Miners have criticized outgoing Democratic Gov. Gerald L.
Baliles for sending state troopers to the coalfields to keep order.
Wilder has not promised to pull the troopers out, and he has said
he supports the state's right-to-work law, which bars compulsory
union membership.
   Still, the miners think Wilder would help them, said union
member Danny Wells of Honaker. ``I think he might do something
different,'' Wells said.
   Wilder told reporters he became confident he would win after a
July debate in which Coleman backed off his anti-abortion views.
Wilder subsequently promoted his support of legalized abortion in
television commercials, but he did not mention the issue this
weekend.
   At a political picnic near Front Royal, 70 miles west of
Washington, D.C., Coleman urged supporters to get out the vote.
   ``What I'm interested in talking about is inspiring the voters
that it's not in the bag,'' he said. ``We've got to work hard if
we're going to have a victory.''
   ``People have started realizing that my vision and my plan for
Virginia are one of optimism and hope. The undecideds are going our
way overwhelmingly.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush came back Sunday to his old
school, Phillips Academy, and lauded ``the rich values'' it taught
him in preparation for life in general and World War II in
particular.
   He referred to it as ``a special, even wondrous place,'' and
recalled a favorite history teacher, his own triumphs on the
athletic fields and even where he was when word came that the
Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor.
   ``It was right about here where that guy in the red coat is
standing that I heard our country was at war,'' said Bush, picking
out a figure in a stadium jacket on the fringe of the crowd. About
2,500 people gathered to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the day
another president, George Washington, visited the school. It is
formally called Phillips Academy but widely known as Andover
because of its location.
   ``Andover's mission _ excellence in education _ remains as true
in 1989 as it was'' when Washington visited, said the Class of '42
alumnus.
   Bush borrowed words from the constitution that founder Samuel
Phillips gave his academy to describe the years he spent at the
school.
   ``I loved those years. They did indeed teach `the great end and
real business of living,''' he said.
   If the view of the ivied campus from Andover Hill remained the
same, much was also different than in Bush's day. Andover, with an
endowment of $180 million, put on a display of its cultural and
racial diversity, with students from several dozen nations parading
their flags and youths from Russia, Africa and other lands joining
Bush in Bible readings.
   Bush, speaking at a reception after the convocation, said his
alma mater ``has much to be proud of. ... Its minority recruitment
and scholarship programs have brought a new vital diversity to the
student body.''
   Thirteen percent of the school's 1,217 students are black or
Hispanic, and 10 percent are Asian.
   Washington stopped at the then 11-year-old school to see his
friend Phillips, a patriot and politician who had furnished
gunpowder to the Revolutionary Army. Later, two Washington nephews
attended Andover on his recommendation. Tuition, room, board and
laundry were only $2 per week at the time.
   ``The costs have changed a little since then, but the quality
has not,'' Bush said. Boarding students now pay $13,500 a year, but
more than a third get financial aid.
   Andover, all male in Bush's day, is now almost half female
following a 1973 merger with its sister school, Abbott Academy.
   In another development, Bush said in an interview published
Sunday by The Dallas Morning News that Vice President Dan Quayle
``absolutely'' will remain on the ticket as his running mate in
1992.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, asked later Sunday at a
stop at Westchester County Airport in White Plains, N.Y., if that
meant Bush has definitely decided to run again, replied: ``I think
they've been thinking in terms of an eight-year team all along. I
hope that's not a surprise to anybody.''
   Sununu added with a laugh, ``I need the job.''
   Bush stopped there to visit with his 88-year-old mother, Dorothy
Walker Bush, for about an hour at her home in Greenwich, Conn.,
before flying back to Washington.
   Bush made the nostalgic visit to Andover without his wife,
Barbara, who returned to the White House directly from Camp David
because of a flu-like illness.
   David M. Underwood, a Houston stockbroker who is president of
Andover's trustees, hailed Bush as ``an embodiment of the spirit of
`non sibi,''' the school's Latin motto: Not For Myself.
   Bush said, ``It is in school, as it was for me here at Phillips
Academy, that we come to understand real values.''
   The president recalled that at his graduation in June 1942 _
just before he enlisted in the Navy to become a combat pilot _
Secretary of War Henry Stimson ``observed the American soldier
should be brave without being brutal; self-reliant without
boasting; becoming a part of inestimable might without losing faith
in individual liberty. I never forgot those words.''

   Dorothy Walker Bush, who at age 88 has
recovered this year from a minor stroke and pneumonia, was well
enough Sunday to pose for a picture with her son the president.
   ``I want you to see how well my ma looks,'' President Bush told
a pool of White House reporters he summoned to the front door of
her home here for a photo opportunity.
   Mrs. Bush, who was hospitalized for a week in September with
pneumonia, emerged in a kelly green dress and jacket, leaning on
the arms of George and his older brother, Prescott Jr.
   The president, who stopped here on his way back to the White
House after a visit to Andover, Mass., pointed to the reporters and
camera crews and said, ``These guys have to travel with us all over
the world. They seem rather good natured about it.''
   Bush, who had last seen his mother at the family's summer home
in Kennebunkport, Maine, two months ago, said, ``Well, we'd better
push on,'' kissed her on the cheek and took his leave, along with
his customary train of police, Secret Service agents and press vans.
   Bush grew up in this posh, rustic community just outside the New
York border, but not in the home where his widowed mother now lives
in.

   A 25-member White House advance team
arrived in Malta Sunday to assess the land facilities required for
the shipboard summit of President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, according to press reports.
   The summit is to be held off Malta on Dec. 2 and 3.
   Maltese newspapers said it was unlikely Bush and Gorbachev would
be on the island at the same time.
   Bush is expected to fly to Malta directly from the United States
on Dec. 1, while Gorbachev probably will arrive the next day after
a visit to Italy and the Vatican, the reports said.
   The Sunday Times said it was not known how far from land the
U.S. and Soviet warships would be but they probably would be
``within sight from shore.''
   News reports said Malta's Foreign Ministry has reserved 1,800
hotel rooms for American and Soviet staff members. Up to 2,000
journalists are expected to cover the meeting, operating from Malta.
   Officials said the White House and Kremlin both want separate
press centers for their journalists. The government is expected to
set up a press center at the Mediterranean Congress Center, which
is close to the mouth of Grand Harbour.
   Maltese newspapers are calling the Bush-Gorbachev meeting the
``post-Yalta summit.''
   U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt stopped in Malta in 1945 to
meet British Prime Minister Winston Churchill before the two
statesmen went to Yalta to map out details of the post-war
settlement with Soviet leader Josef Stalin.
   A cartoon in The Sunday Times showed Bush and Gorbachev shaking
hands with the Soviet president saying:
   ``We've come a long way George.''
   Bush replies: ``Yeah Mick ... from Yalta to Malta.''
   Malta still treasures the U.S. Army jeep thatr Roosevelt used
when he stopped in Malta before going to the Yalta conference. It
is exhibited at the island's war museum in Valletta, close to the
Mediterranean Congress Center.

   Troops dispersed about 100
Americans who prayed with Arabs Sunday and had held a sit-in in a
West Bank town where residents refused to pay taxes in solidarity
with the Palestinian uprising.
   Elsewhere, Arab assailants stabbed two Israelis and seven
Palestinians were injured in clashes with security forces,
including a teen-ager shot by border police after a chase through
the market streets of Bethlehem.
   A 19-year-old Palestinian died of wounds suffered Friday.
   The death of Mufied Jamil Huzboon brought to 610 the number of
Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the
23-month-old uprising. Forty Israelis have also been killed in the
violence.
   The army said soldiers shot the youth in the West Bank town of
Jenin after he ignored orders to stop. It said Huzboon was wanted
for firebomb attacks and assaults on alleged Arab informants.
   In the West Bank town of Beit Sahour, about 6,000 Christian and
Moslem Arabs were joined by about 100 U.S. supporters for prayer
services in churches and mosques.
   The American group included activists from pro-Palestinian and
human rights organizations in 25 states, participants said.
   Last week, the army lifted a six-week blockade of Beit Sahour.
During the six months cars, television sets and other property were
seized in an effort to break a Palestinian tax boycott.
   Overseen by hundreds of Israeli paratroopers, protesters in Beit
Sahour also staged a roadside service and a march, waving outlawed
Palestinian flags and signs that read: ``No taxation under
occupation.''
   Israeli peace activists and journalists were kept out of the
town.
   Tom Martin, a protester from Washington, D.C., said 36 Americans
sat in front of army jeeps and several refused demands by troops to
leave.
   Dan Van Hoeven, a Protestant minister from Kalamazoo, Mich.,
said he was pushed and dragged by soldiers after refusing to move.
Brian Smith, a student from Chicago, said he was slapped by a
soldier.
   An army spokeswoman said troops intervened when the protesters
``staged a sit-in on the road after the prayers. Soldiers dispersed
them without force and arrests.''
   The American group later issued a statement protesting alleged
army violations of legal and human rights in Beit Sahour.
   A Palestinian resident of Bir Zeit who had been convicted of
transferring $300,000 in Palestine Liberation Organization funds to
uprising activists was sentenced by a military court to two years
in prison.
   The court said Faed Hussein el-Haj, 29, received $200,000 from
Sari Nusseibeh, a Palestinian intellectual who Israel accuses of
acting as paymaster of the Palestinian uprising. Other pro-PLO
sources provided the rest of the money, the court said.
   Nusseibeh, a philosphy professor at the West Bank's Bir Zeit
Nusseibeh, has not been arrested but was named in May as an
unindicted co-conspirator in a case against four Arabs accused of
masterminding the uprising. Nusseibeh has denied the allegations.
   In Jerusalem, two Palestinian youths stabbed New York-born
Avraham Feld, 35, with a screwdriver. Jerusalem Police Chief Arye
Bibi said several suspects were detained. Hadassah Hospital
spokeswoman Orna Cohen said Feld suffered a chest wound.
   Two Arabs stabbed a Druse Arab border policeman inside a
bathroom at a Tel Aviv bus station, slightly wounding him in the
arms, police spokeswoman Dalia Gilad said.
   In Bethlehem, four border policemen chased four youths after the
youths hurled stones at troops. A policeman chased one youth down a
side street and shot at him, witnesses reported. They said the
youth fell to the ground, bloodied and clutching his stomach.
   Police refused to let onlookers take the youth to a hospital and
dispersed the crowd by firing in the air. Officers took the wounded
youth away in a jeep.
   The military command said he was among a group of masked
Palestinians who were building a stone barricade and ignored orders
to stop. A spokeswoman said the youth was wounded in the buttocks.

<TEXT>
   The conservative New Democracy Party led
in national elections Sunday but narrowly missed a parliamentary
majority, throwing Greece into its second period of political
uncertainty in five months.
   With 96.2 percent of the votes counted, New Democracy, led by
Constantine Mitsotakis, had 46.3 percent. It was followed by former
Premier Andreas Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement with
40.7 percent and the Coalition of the Left and Progress, headed by
Communist Harilaos Florakis, with 10.8 percent. The rest went to
small parties. Official returns were broadcast by state television.
   New Democracy needed 151 seats in the 300-seat single-chamber
Parliament to control the government after eight years of socialist
rule and a brief coalition administration.
   Government projections showed New Democracy with 148 seats, 128
seats going to the socialists and 21 to the leftist Coalition. The
other three seats would go to independents, including one
environmentalist.
   A tough period of bargaining was expected to begin shortly on
forming a new government. The leading parties are widely divided
over such major issues as economic policy and the presence of U.S.
military bases in Greece.
   Mitsotakis told a news conference his party would ``act in a way
that is best for the nation'' but did not spell out his plans for
working out a coalition. ``Without a doubt our political life is
entering a difficult phase,'' he said.
   Papandreou said, ``It gives us special satisfaction that after
the June elections we have had such a significant rise ... despite
the unbelievable barrage of attacks made against us and despite the
fact that we were out of the government.''
   Papandreou's party did not appear to be damaged by its leader's
indictment on corruption charges in September.
   Polls were open from sunrise to sunset, with voting compulsory
for the estimated 8 million citizens aged 18 and over. Final
results were unlikely before Monday afternoon.
   In Athens, motorists waving green socialist party banners or
blue-and-white New Democracy flags sped through the central
Syntagma Square, leaning on their horns.
   Although a national election June 18 produced no majority, the
Coalition of the Left and Progress agreed to team with its enemies,
the conservatives, in a short-term government dedicated only to
investigating scandals that dogged the final years of the 1981-89
socialist administration.
   The coalition government resigned last month after indicting
Papandreou on charges of involvement in a multimillion-dollar
banking scandal and of ordering wiretapping of the telephones of
friends and foes.
   Papandreou has said he is innocent and maintains the indictments
were politically motivated.
   The leader of the Communist-led coalition, Florakis, said: ``It
is an undisputed fact that the coalition will be at the center of
post-electoral developments in our country.''
   Florakis' group wants to evict U.S. bases from Greece and
opposes extraditing a Palestinian suspected of terrorism, Mohammed
Rashid, to the United States.
   Mitsotakis, 71, campaigned on promises to cut the government's
heavy role in the economy and strengthen ties with NATO and the
United States. He accused the former government of ruining the
economy, citing a $58 billion public debt.
   Papandreou, 70, promised to boost pensions and other benefits if
elected and to hold a public referendum before approving any new
base treaty with the United States.
   Greece's simple proportional system makes it difficult for
parties to gain an overall majority. In June, New Democracy won 145
seats; the socialists got 125 seats; the Coalition got 28 seats and
two went to independents.
   Many observers said before Sunday's elections that Greece could
face a period of political instability even if one party won a
majority.
   That is because Parliament must elect a new president in March.
While the president is largely a figurehead and has far fewer
powers than the prime minister, Greek law dictates that Parliament
must be dissolved and new elections held if no candidate can muster
three-fifths of the vote in Parliament.
   One voting irregularity was reported. The spokesman for the
caretaker government, Nikos Themelis, said authorities were
investigating a report that socialist supporters prevented an
unknown number of sailors on two ships from disembarking to vote on
the southeastern Aegean island of Kalimnos.

<HEAD>Newly Reformed Social Democrats Remain Split at End of Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newly reformed Social Democratic
Party ended a three-day congress Sunday unable to resolve
ideological differences that led one faction to split from the
party the day before.
   Party faithful expressed hope the split would end months of
wrangling that had paralyzed party efforts to prepare for the first
free elections since 1948.
   The roots of the party's ideological struggle go back to 1948,
when the Social Democratic Party bowed to pressure from the
Communists and far-left Social Democrats and was absorbed by the
Communist Party.
   The party was briefly revived during the 1956 anti-Stalinist
revolution but disappeared again after Soviet tanks invaded and
re-established communist domination. It reformed this year,
following the now-defunct Communist Party's decision to permit
opposition parties and prepare for multiparty elections next year.
   The Communist Party dissolved itself Oct. 7 and reconstituted
itself as the Hungarian Socialist Party. But many Social Democrats
mindful of the 1948 fusion remain mistrustful of the true political
beliefs both of the new party and of those they see as seeking to
cross over to the Social Democratic Party.
   The break occurred Saturday, when Gyoergy Ruttner, a Communist
Party member as recently as January, walked out, followed by about
40 delegates to an alternate conference site that was rented in
anticipation of the split.
   The breakway faction has announced that it is going to organize
the Independent Social Democratic Party, which will be to the left
of the main faction.
   The split followed heated debate on whether to represent classic
worker interests or be closer to Social Democratic positions found
in Western Europe.
   Party spokeswoman Anna Petrasovits told reporters that Social
Democratic aims included a ``liberal economy, strong unionism,
social security.''
   Like Warsaw Pact ally Poland, Hungary has made dizzying moves in
the past year to break with its socialist past by establishing
democratic, economic and social reforms and improve ties to the
West.
   The parliamentary elections are to be scheduled by June.

   Two small planes collided just after taking

killing all four people aboard the aircraft.
   A turboprop King Air and a Cessna collided shortly before noon
about 500 feet above the intersection of the two runways, Fire

the airport.
   No one on the ground was injured.

said.
   Robert Horton, 30, of Boaz, and Leo Dziados, 56, of Uniontown,
Ohio, were killed aboard the King Air, Bragg said. The plane was
leased by Brenlin Corp. of Akron, Ohio, parent company of the local
Gulf States Steel Corp., airport manager Fred Anderton said.
   Two officials from the National Transportation Safety Board
arrived in Gadsen to investigate the crash, said John Whiteside of
the Federal Aviation Administration's regional office in Atlanta.

<HEAD>Boeing Makes New Offer, But Machinists See No New Money</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs with company saying offer is final, union
comments; picks up 8th graf pvs, `Union members ...' Version moving on
financial wires.</HEAD>

   The Boeing Co. defended its new offer in the
month-old Machinists strike as ``an excellent package'' and said it
was final, but union negotiators said it actually took away from
the aerospace giant's offer made in October.
   ``Boeing will find that our members are angry and determined not
to be insulted and degraded by takeaways and phony number games,''
Tom Baker, president of Machinists union District Lodge 751, said
at a news conference.
   Boeing's chief negotiator, Larry McKean, said at a separate news
conference that the company has offered all it will and the union
should let members vote. Although the overall amount of money was
unchanged, McKean said the latest offer addressed employees' desire
for better lump sum payments and retirement benefits and less
overtime.
   ``They have our best proposal,'' McKean said. ``This is our
final offer.''
   The union has no intention of putting the ``insulting'' offer to
its members because reductions in cost-of-living increases made it
less attractive than last month's proposal, Baker said.
   ``Really, it's a takeaway,'' he said.
   Baker said he didn't expect any new talks this week. ``The
company knows what we want,'' he said. ``As soon as they want to
talk, we'll be here.''
   Talks broke off abruptly Saturday after almost a week of daily
negotiations. Federal mediator Douglas Hammond said no further
talks were scheduled.
   Machinists international vice president Justin Ostro accused the
company of raising employees' hopes by talking last week even
though it had no intention of putting more money on the table.
Boeing will pay with years of lower productivity if it loses the
faith of its workers, he said.
   ``This company is going to pay a very, very terrible price by
this strike,'' Ostro said.
   Union members picketing in Seattle appeared split on whether the
latest Boeing offer should be sent to the membership.
   ``That sounds like a good offer to me,'' said Barb McCallick,
65, of Des Moines, a Seattle suburb.
   ``They can afford more than that,'' said Beatrice Moreno, 26, of
Seattle. ``If we don't stand up now, we won't get anything.''
   Saturday was the sixth straight day of face-to-face
negotiations, after Hammond met separately with both sides last
Sunday. Hammond had said he hoped to keep both sides at the table
until an agreement could be reached.
   The strike began Oct. 4, the day after the union representing
57,800 Boeing workers voted down the three-year contract offer.
   That offer included annual pay raises of 4 percent, 3 percent
and 3 percent, and bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first
year and 3 percent in the second. There also were cost-of-living
increases to virtually cover inflation, a reduction in mandatory
overtime from 200 to 160 hours per quarter and higher benefits.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said the new offer contained the
same wage increases, but boosted the lump sum payments to 10
percent the first year, 4 percent the second year and 4 percent the
third year.
   However, Binder said that while there were changes, the overall
value of the offer was essentially the same as that of the offer
rejected Oct. 3.
   The union has said all along it wants more money.
   The Machinists represent 43,300 Boeing workers inthe local
District 751 lodge; 12,000 in Wichita, Kan.; 1,700 in Portland,
Ore.; and a few hundred at scattered sites in California, Hawaii,
Utah, Montana, Wyoming and other states.

<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas on Sunday claimed
their forces wounded three Afghan army generals in the southeastern
city of Kandahar and killed 29 government troopers in another
attack.
   In Moscow, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported Afghan
government soldiers cleared the vital supply link to the capital of
Kabul through the Salang mountain pass in fighting that killed 86
people.
   There was no independent confirmation of either report.
   MIDIA, a joint news agency of Afghan guerrillas based in
Pakistan, said guerrillas launched a rocket attack on the Kandahar
airport on Oct. 29, wounding two visiting army generals.
   They were identified as Ali Akbar, the area corps commander, and
Halim, military police chief of Kandahar province.
   It said the Kandahar chief of military intelligence, Gen.
Shamshuddin, was wounded by a rebel-planted mine.
   MIDIA also reported that 11 officers and 18 enlisted men were
killed when guerrillas attacked the Shindand airbase in western
Farah province.
   It did not say when the assault occurred or give further details.
   The Tass report said government forces drove back guerrillas who
had been blocking supply convoys on the Salang highway between
Kabul and the Soviet border.
   It quoted the Afghan military command as accusing the Pakistani
ecret service and guerrilla commanders Ahmad Shah Masud and Sufi
Payand of organizing the blockade of food supplies headed for Kabul.
   Tass said 86 people were killed and 12 were wounded in the
fighting, but it did not say if the casualties were soldiers or
guerrillas or give any further details.
   Columns of Soviet units traveled north up the main highway
through Salang to the Soviet Union in the final Soviet withdrawal
from Afghanistan in February.
   Soviet troops had entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help
the Marxist government fight the rebels.

   Singer-songwriter Barry Sadler, who
recorded the hit ``Ballad of the Green Berets'' in 1966, died
Sunday. He was 49.
   Sadler, who suffered brain damage from a shooting, died at the
Alvin C. York Medical Center, hospital spokesman Albert Archie
said. A cause of death was not given and an autopsy will be
performed, he said.
   Sadler had been hospitalized in Murfreesboro or Cleveland since
he was critically wounded in 1988 in Guatemala while training
Contra rebels.
   He became the center of a guardianship dispute between his
mother and a son over who would handle his affairs. A probate judge
in Cleveland in February said Sadler's family had agreed to the
appointment of an independent guardian.
   Sadler, as Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler, co-wrote and recorded
``Ballad of the Green Berets'' which was the No. 1 song in the
country for five weeks in 1966.
   The song, a narrative tribute to the Special Forces, sold 9
million singles and albums. Sadler had not been singing for at
least 10 years.
   He wrote more than 20 adventure books, featuring the mercenary
Casca.
   Sadler is survived by his wife, Lavona, and three children.

   Republican mayoral hopeful Rudolph Giuliani,
well behind in the polls with only two days to go, called Democrat
David Dinkins dishonest Sunday and promised to investigate his
financial dealings if elected.
   Dinkins bristled at what he called Giuliani's ``distortions and
complaints,'' and said he had put to rest questions about a stock
transfer to his son and his failure to file income taxes 20 years
ago.
   Dinkins, who is seeking to become the city's first black mayor,
also pointed out that three of New York's four daily newspapers
have endorsed him.
   ``Those editorial boards know me and know Mr. Giuliani and
selected Dinkins,'' he said in the opening minutes of a lively and
often contentious televised debate, the second and final one of the
campaign.
   ``If he's the greatest thing since sliced bread as he argues,
why is it that they haven't turned to him?'' Dinkins said.
   The latest poll, conducted for the Daily News and WABC-TV, shows
Dinkins leading Giuliani by 54 percent to 38 percent. The poll had
a margin of error of plus or minus 5{ percentage points.
   The winner of Tuesday's election will succeed Mayor Ed Koch, who
lost the Democratic primary to Dinkins.
   Seeking to make up ground, Giuliani opened Sunday's debate
aggressively, hitting hard at Dinkins' personal finances.
   The former U.S. attorney charged that Dinkins was involved in a
cover-up by failing to follow through on a promise to make public
more details of the stock transfer to his son. Giuliani has
questioned whether Dinkins significantly undervalued the stock in
the transfer.
   Referring to Dinkins' charge in their first debate Saturday
night that New Yorkers need ``a mayor, not a prosecutor,'' Giuliani
said, ``I think the people of this town want a mayor who has
nothing to fear from a prosecutor.''
   Talking to reporters afterward, Giuliani said he would launch a
city investigation into Dinkins' finances if elected.
   ``I think it is now quite clear that he does not have the
honesty and integrity that commends him to the voters,'' Giuliani
said.
   Told of Giuliani's pledge, Dinkins brushed it off, saying, ``I
suppose he just can't get the prosecutor out of himself. He seems
not to realize that he's running for mayor.''
   During the debate, Dinkins accused Giuliani of flip-flopping on
abortion by saying that although he personally opposed it, he would
continue city funding for abortions for poor women.
   Giuliani said his position was similar to that of other
Catholics like Gov. Mario Cuomo and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.

   Vladimir Horowitz, the Russian-born virtuoso who
brought ``controlled thunder'' to the piano in a glorious career
that spanned most of the century, died Sunday at his home. He was
85.
   His manager, Peter Gelb, said Horowitz died in the early
afternoon of a heart attack at his home in Manhattan.
   He said Horowitz had been in good health and as recently as last
week was recording, his living room transformed into a studio as
was his custom. Less than three weeks ago, hundreds of admirers
filled a record store for an album-signing session.
   Horowitz's last public performances were in the spring of 1987
in Berlin, Hamburg, West Germany, and Amsterdam, Netherlands, Gelb
said. The year before, he had returned to Moscow for the first time
in 61 years for an emotional, memorable concert shown on American
television.
   His final American performances were in the fall of 1986, Gelb
said, when he played at New York's Lincoln Center and the reopening
of the refurbished Carnegie Hall.
   He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Wanda, the daughter of
the famed conductor, Arturo Toscanini.
   In a letter of condolence to Mrs. Horowitz, composer and
conductor Leonard Bernstein called the temperamental pianist ``this
amazing man.''
   ``He was not only a super pianist, but a super musician with all
the mortal fallibilities such geniuses have,'' Bernstein wrote.
   Pianist Andre Watts said: ``It would be hard to come up with an
equivalent. There isn't another Horowitz. Thank God for
recordings.'' He likened him to ``a demon barely under control out
there on the stage.''
   Often hailed as one of the greatest concert pianists, Horowitz
left Russia in 1925 and came to the United States in 1928, playing
his first American concert seven days later.
   He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's
highest civilian award in 1986, the Legion of Honor from France and
Italy's Order of Merit. He also was the recipient of more than 20
Grammy awards.
   Horowitz was the model for a generation of pianists and the
highest-paid classical pianist in the world. By 1978, he was called
a ``national treasure'' by President Carter.
   Indeed, Horowitz three times played the White House _ first at
Herbert Hoover's request, second at Carter's, on the occasion of
the 50th anniversary of the pianist's arrival in the United States
in 1978, and the third in October 1986 for President Reagan.
   ``We are saddened at the loss of this world renowned musician,''
a White House statement said Sunday. ``We extend our sympathies to
his family. His musical legacy will continue to live on.''
   The honors were bestowed on the man one music critic described
as possessing ``all the color resource in the world and a sonority
that is unparalleled in the history of piano playing.''
   Horowitz, whose sartorial trademark was a sporty bow tie, was
known for his intense, electric performances, his technique and
skill, his rich interpretations, speed and a power described as
``controlled thunder.'' His style of playing and choice of
repertoire led him to be dubbed the last great Romantic pianist.
   He himself called playing the piano as ``the coordination of
mind, heart and finger,'' with emotion the key.
   ``The brain is the control of emotion; there has to be something
to be controlled. The heart is the guide, the brain is the control;
what comes out had to have both,'' he once said.
   The drama that ruled his performances also guided his career,
which he often interrupted for long periods _ the first time from
1936 to 1939, following an illness, and the second from 1953 to
1965, for reasons never explained.
   He continued to make records during the second retirement, happy
to be away from the wearying pace of the concert circuit. He also
served as mentor to five concert pianists who later told of the
complex relationship that evolved between them and their volatile
teacher.
   Horowitz forbade his students to say they were studying under
him. He would often cancel lessons and normally taught while
stretched on his living room couch. His students also said the
pianist was unable to transmit the secret of his techniques, and
called him a man of extremes, from his music to his moods.
   The ``demon inside me'' that urged him to do better, and a
desire to perform in public again, brought him back to the concert
stage when he was 61, with what critics said was a new maturity and
a wider range.
   When he returned to Carnegie Hall in 1965, music lovers demanded
four encores and refused to leave the concert hall even after the
lights were dimmed.
   The pace of his concerts continued to slow as he grew older, but
his reputation was undiminished. When he returned to the Soviet
Union in April 1986, determined fans rushed police and stormed his
Moscow concert and open rehearsal.

   The pianist was born Vladimir Gorowicz on Oct. 1, 1904, on
Kiev's Music Street. His father, Simeon, was a prosperous engineer
impoverished by the Russian Revolution. His mother, Sophie Bodik,
was a good amateur pianist who instilled such a love of music in
her three children that daughter Regina also became a concert
pianist and son, Georg, a violin teacher.
   Horowitz was given piano lessons when he was 6 and made moderate
progress until age 9, when he stunned his parents by learning all
the Rachmaninoff pieces in the family library and all the piano
scores of Wagner's operas. He attended the Kiev Conservatory, where
from age 12 to 16 he studied piano and composition under Felix
Blumenfeld.
   He made his concert debut at age 19, seeking a way to earn money
for his family.
   In 1925, when he was idolized in Petrograd _ now Leningrad _ and
even had a fan club known as ``the green girls'' for their
cardigans, Horowitz left the Soviet Union on a six-month visa to
study in the West. His stay away lasted 61 years.
   Horowitz won international fame in 1926 during a Berlin concert
series and continued to tour Europe, soloing under all the great
conductors. He made his American debut in January 1928, and was an
instant success.
   In 1933, he was chosen to solo for conductor Toscanini's last in
a series of Beethoven concerts. Toscanini also introduced Horowitz
to his daughter. At the end of the year they were married in Milan
and settled in a townhouse on Manhattan's upper East Side. He
became a U.S. citizen.
   Horowitz' only real rival for acclaim and popularity was Artur
Rubinstein, who died in 1982. Rubinstein conceded that Horowitz was
the better pianist, but not the better musician.
   The concerts in the Moscow and Leningrad were part of a renewed
U.S.-Soviet cultural exchange.
   Horowitz was a longtime critic of the Soviet system _ ``I don't
like the Russian approach to music, to art, to anything'' _ and
repeatedly said he would never return. His family property was
confiscated after his defection, and it was years before a few of
his recordings were released there.
   But when he decided to return, taking along his Steinway, it was
obvious his countrymen had not forgotten him. It was the most
talked-about musical event in the Soviet Union in years.
   Though the visit received sparse if positive coverage in the
official media, hundreds of students unable to get tickets charged
into the concert hall in Moscow and joined a VIP-laden audience in
giving him a thundering ovation. The concert was broadcast live in
the United States by CBS-TV, and later shown on Soviet television.
   In Leningrad, Horowitz got a seven-minute standing ovation. In
the audience was the last surviving ``green girl.''
   ``They are very sweet to me here,'' he said.
   Horowitz preferred to perform on Sunday afternoons, and rarely
practiced more than two hours a day.
   ``I have practiced enough in my life ...,'' he said. ``The most
important thing is the spirit.''
   He traveled with his favorite videocassettes, and occasionally
visited New York's trendy nightclubs, not for the disco music _
which he blocked with ear plugs _ but for the change.
   Neighbors became used to seeing him strolling near Central Park.
Those walks were once recommended by his idol and early discoverer,
Rachmaninoff. The Russian master, Horowitz said, once told him:
``If you don't walk, your fingers will not run.''

<HEAD>Brazil and Argentina Spearhead Drive Toward Latin American Common
Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD LEWAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil and Argentina, the ailing
giants of South America, are trying to salvage their crumbling
economies by starting a common market modeled after Europe and the
United States.
   The traditional rivals say cooperation is the only way for Latin
America to head off economic disaster.
   ``There aren't many options. Either we work out a joint strategy
in line with our development needs, or we will be the objects of
outside strategies,'' Argentine President Carlos Menem told
Brazil's Congress during a three-day visit in August.
   Burdened by stagnant growth, four-digit inflation and a combined
foreign debt of some $170 billion, Brazil and Argentina have
knocked down some trade barriers and recently agreed to boost trade
and cooperation to unprecedented levels.
   The idea is not new. In the last three decades, an array of
organizations _the Latin American Association of Free Commerce, the
Andean Pact, the Latin American Development Association and, most
recently, the Latin American Economic System _ were devised to
unite Latin American economies.
   All failed, mostly because of excessive protectionism,
nationalism and cultural antagonism.
   But this time around, Latin American leaders say they can lick
the problem by starting small.
   Tiny Uruguay, which borders the two giants, recently joined
Brazil and Argentina in the common market scheme. Now, these three
countries hope to attract other nations to the fold, or at least
set an example for other regional trade blocs.
   ``It's the only way for Latin America to create a common
market,'' said Helio Jaguaribe, director of research at Rio de
Janeiro's Institute of Political and Social Research. ``The
Brazil-Argentina accords have become a spotlight for other
countries to follow.''
   The renewed interest in a Latin common market was sparked by the
growth of trade alliances in Western Europe, between the United
States and Canada, and between Japan and its Asian neighbors,
analysts say.
   ``Integration is fundamental,'' Fernando Collor de Mello,
Brazil's leading presidential candidate, said recently. ``Latin
America cannot be left out of this new world order.''
   Increasingly, the region's leaders are dismantling or selling
off the powerful but often inefficient state-run enterprises and
turning to free market principles.
   The return of civilian regimes in much of Latin America also has
helped foster mutual trust and economic liberalism that was lacking
under military rule, when generals were more concerned with
``national security.''
   ``The old military governments hardly wanted to share their
secrets or strengths with their neighbors,'' said Paulo Rabello de
Castro, a private economic consultant in Rio and managing editor of
the respected financial monthly Conjutora Economica. He said that
mutual suspicion no longer exists.
   Indeed, Menem and Sarney recently signed agreements to swap
military, space and nuclear technology, and increase cultural
exchange programs.
   The growth of Latin American industry also will boost
integration, economists say.
   Nations such as Venezuela, Chile, Brazil and Argentina are no
longer as dependent on foreign technology as they were 30 years
ago. Today, they can trade a wide variety of products and resources
without foreign assistance.
   ``The integration gears are meshing,'' de Castro said. ``By
early next century a common market scheme could be in place
complete with a regional judiciary system.''
   But large hurdles remain.
   The current economic woes of Argentina and Brazil have left
those countries without the funds needed to support and finance a
continent-wide market, said economist Carlos Alberto Primo Braga, a
visiting professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies.
   ``It's hard to achieve integration when the region's economies
are in recession,'' said economist Celso Furtado, a former
Brazilian planning minister. ``The last thing fragile, internal
industries will want is competition from other countries.''
   Many analysts say economic growth needed to foster a common
market will only start when the continent's $440 billion foreign
debt becomes less of a burden.
   Argentina is virtually bankrupt and $4.5 billion behind in
payments on its $60 billion foreign debt.
   Even Brazil, which boasts the world's eighth biggest economy and
the third largest trade surplus, spends most of its export earnings
to pay interest on its $110 billion foreign debt, the Third World's
largest.
   To ease the burden, Latin leaders are considering proposals to
swap foreign debt to create a Latin American common market fund,
according to Aloizio Mercadante Oliva, professor of economics at
Sao Paulo's Catholic University.
   Another obstacle is the lack of a strong local currency. The
value of Brazil's new cruzado drops daily, and Argentina's austral
has plummeted more than 97 percent against the U.S. dollar in the
last five months.
   ``We'd have a tough time trading even shoe laces with our funny
money,'' said Rabello de Castro.
   To cope with the ``funny money'' problem, Brazil and Argentina
have a $500 million reciprocal credit agreement under which they
import and export each others' products without the use of currency.
   Large trade imbalances between nations and a reluctance to loan
cash and share technology continue to impede integration, analysts
say.
   Indeed, since South America's two largest trading partners
announced their common market plans in 1985, Brazil has run up a
$500 million trade surplus with Argentina.
   But that too may be changing. Brazil in August agreed to accept
up to $350 million worth of Argentine-financed projects for
transportation, hospital construction and hydroelectric equipment.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For all the stock market's seemingly manic
behavior lately, some analysts see a message behind its madness.
   Amid the controversies over program trading and corporate
takeovers, stock traders sometimes appear to have veered off on a
through-the-looking glass digression from what is taking place
elsewhere in the economy.
   But at the same time, close followers of the financial scene
say, the market has taken on an increasingly powerful role, not
just in reacting to economic trends and government policies, but
also in helping to determine them.
   Ever since the Crash of 1987, these analysts note, the Federal
Reserve has been forced to give a lot of weight to the state of the
stock market in setting its credit policies.
   Legislators, too, have effectively been put on notice that they
can't start changing rules _ for instance, on taxes, corporate
takeovers or foreign investment in this country _ without taking
into account how stock investors might react.
   The implicit penalty for a misstep on any of these matters is a
sudden drop in stock prices that threatens far-reaching trouble for
the domestic and world economies, not to mention for any
policymakers who wind up taking the blame.
   This ``vigilante'' effect first gained wide attention in the
bond market in the early 1980s.
   In the view of many analysts, the large, amorphous group of
people who invest in bonds became increasingly fearful that the
Federal Reserve wasn't doing enough to restrain inflation.
   So they collectively refused to bid for bonds until interest
rates reached levels that restrained the growth of credit.
   ``Their market actions encouraged, or some would say compelled,
central banks to tighten to slow economic growth and prevent any
inflation resurgence,'' said Robert Barbera, economist at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``Today, we contend, it is stock market reaction to too-tight
monetary policy that at times influences monetary policy and that
reduces somewhat the risk of global recession.
   ``Thus, in the second half of the 1980s, stock market vigilantes
have replaced the bond market vigilantes of the first half.''
   Analysts say this shift was clearly demonstrated in the
aftermath of Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987. The Fed, which had been
tightening credit before stocks crashed, abruptly began to supply
assurances of plentiful amounts of money.
   In addition, a bill that had been taking shape in Congress to
discourage some forms of takeover activity was shelved.
   Another severe selloff on Friday, Oct. 13, of this year once
again drew signals from the Fed that it would provide whatever
liquidity was necessary to stave off a market collapse.
   As time passes, ``the Fed continues to watch the stock market,''
said Darwin Beck, economist at First Boston Corp.
   All this naturally raises several issues: Who appointed bond and
stock traders to these positions of power? Can they be trusted to
use it wisely, or even responsibly? If they don't, to whom do they
have to account?
   The answer to any of those questions depends to a great extent
on the respondent's point of view.
   Defenders of the vigilantes say they are unlikely ever to engage
in any sort of conspiracy, given their sheer diversity and the fact
that they compete against each other for their livelihoods.
   Skeptics, on the other hand, can cite the history of the 1980s
as conclusive evidence of the susceptibility of unfettered markets
to abuse of many kinds.
   On one point, however, most observers agree. The modern
financial vigilante is a product of an era when many governments
around the world have promoted free markets as the best means of
making societies and economies work.
   The activities of the stock-market vigilantes now promise to be
studied in the future as a test of whether that premise is right.

<HEAD>College Savings Bond Program Provides Tax-Free Tuition Savings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Starting Jan. 1, parents can take advantage of a
savings bond program that will allow them to put away money for
their children's college education tax-free.
   The program involves the U.S. Treasury's Series EE savings
bonds, which have been around for years. The difference is that
federal tax on the bonds' interest will be forgiven if the proceeds
are used for tuition. Savings bonds always are exempt from state
and local taxes.
   The program is limited to residents at least 24 years old who
meet certain income requirements: married couples with adjusted
gross incomes of $60,000 a year and under, and single people with
incomes of $40,000 and under.
   For those with higher incomes, the tax-deductibility is reduced
according to a scale. Married couples with incomes of $90,000 and
over and singles with incomes of $55,000 or more cannot participate.
   The bonds may only be bought by parents for their children;
other relatives may not participate.
   Using savings bonds to put away money for college education has
long been popular, but the 1986 federal tax code revision made it
less advantageous.
   Before the tax law changes, parents typically would buy bonds in
their child's name and declare the interest as income on tax forms
filed for their children. This way, the child usually would pay no
tax since the interest income would be lower than the child's
minimum taxable income.
   However, the revised code taxes children under age 14 at their
parents' marginal tax rate instead of at the children's rate. That
eliminated some of the tax advantage.
   The new program should restore the popularity of savings bonds
for college tuition funding, said Stephen Meyerhardt, a spokesman
for the Treasury's savings bond program.
   He said the new program is simpler than the traditional way of
putting away college funds in bonds because there is no need to
file annual tax forms for the children.
   Instead, the bonds will be bought in the parents' names and
interest will only be declared when a bond is cashed in to pay for
tuition. He said the Internal Revenue Service is still working on
rules for how this interest will be excluded from taxation.
   Series EE Treasury bonds sell for half their face value. The
face value is paid at maturity. They can be bought for as little as
$25 and are sold at most banks and savings and loans.
   Meyerhardt said the Treasury has been deluged with inquiries
about the program. ``Obviously, the potential audience is huge,''
he said last week.
   While university officials generally praise the savings plan,
they say they wish it had been extended to grandparents and
students as well.
   Richard F. Rosser, president of the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities, agreed there should be great
demand for the program.
   ``It's simple and it's uncomplicated,'' he said. ``This may very
well become an important savings program for just taking it out of
your monthly wages. People have bought EE bonds for years through
payroll deductions.''
   This is not the first college bond program. Several states have
marketed some of their normal state revenue bonds as tuition
savings bonds.
   These bonds, like Treasury bonds, are zero-coupon bonds, meaning
there is no annual interest payment, or ``coupon.'' That's why
they're sold at a discount, with their face amount paid at maturity.
   In Washington state, a $50 million initial offering quickly sold
out last year, said Edward Palmer, a first vice president at
Security Pacific Bank Washington, the lead manager for the bonds.
   Though a $200 million issue this year was not a sellout, Palmer
said the state and the bank consider the program ``extremely
successful.''
   ``You really feel like you're doing something for people,''
Palmer said.
   Among other states that have issued college savings bonds are
Illinois and North Carolina.

   The publisher of Ladies Home Journal, Robert D.
Thomas, said Sunday he was stepping down after 12 years in the post
to ``pursue other business and publishing interests.''
   Thomas is being replaced by Donna Galotti, who had been
advertising director of the women's service magazine since joining
it in 1987.
   Thomas was said to be unavailable to discuss his plans or his
reasons for leaving the magazine, which is owned by Meredith Corp.
of Des Moines, Iowa.
   He joined the magazine's Chicago office in 1966 as an account
manager, and was western sales manager from 1971-77.
   Myrna Blyth, publishing director and editor-in-chief of the
magazine, said Galotti's selection as publisher comes after the
magazine posted a stellar advertising performance over the past 12
months.
   The November issue was the largest in the magazine's 106-year
history and brought its ad page total to 1,624 for the year, up 18
percent or 245 pages from 1988.
   ``Donna has done a tremedous job as advertising director and we
know she will be an even greater asset to the magazine as
publisher,'' Blyth said in a statement.
   Galotti said in the statement that her goal is to ``continue
breaking records in terms of ad pages and circulation.''
   She had previously been eastern manager at Woman's Day magazine.

<HEAD>Florida Firm Developing Nation's Fastest Train</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gritty freight trains that pass by
the office building help keep work in perspective for R. Redding
Stevenson Jr.
   The groaning engines and clatter of boxcars offer are a sharp
contrast to the sleek design and sophisticated features proposed
for what could be the nation's fastest train network. But they also
remind Stevenson of how little trains are used to carry passengers,
particularly in the car-clogged Sunbelt.
   ``There's a lot of people who've never even been on a train, let
alone use one to commute or go on trips,'' said Stevenson,
president of Florida High Speed Rail Corp., the only company left
seeking the $2.2 billion project to connect Miami, Orlando and
Tampa with a train capable of traveling at 150 mph.
   ``As our roads get more congested, as airport delays become more
routine, rail looks more and more like the option for the future.''
   The Boca Raton-based consortium of more than 30 firms _ from
rail designers to real estate planners _ appears virtually certain
of receiving the state contract for the high-speed project after
last week's withdrawal of its sole competitor, TGV of Florida Inc.,
a subsidiary of the French ``bullet train'' operators.
   The Florida High Speed Rail Commission has asked the company to
develop more detailed plans for the construction and operation of
the 300-mile system. The final contract should be awarded next year.
   ``We are truly seeing history in the making,'' said Commission
Chairman Malcolm Kirschenbaum in Orlando last week.
   Stevenson, a former real estate developer, was joined the
project in the initial stages as a consultant and ended up
conductor.
   In the early 1980s, Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. was among an
international group of companies with interest in the Florida
project. As an incentive to bidders, the state offered exclusive
real estate development rights along much of the rail line, and
Bombardier sought out AmeriFirst Development Corp., one of
Florida's largest home builders.
   When Bombardier dropped out, Stevenson, then an AmeriFirst
executive, approached Asea Brown Boveri, a multinational firm
heavily involved in high-speed rail technology. The corporation was
formed in 1986.
   The company's plans call for steel-wheel trains, rather than the
more experimental magnetic-levitation systems used in Japan that
can exceed 200 mph. But Stevenson said magnetic trains could be
used as feeders to some of the 13 proposed stations.
   To promote business travel, Stevenson envisions office-type cars
used on some European trains with computers, telephones, copiers
and facsimile machines.
   Stevenson also says the rail system will court the state's
estimated 50 million annual tourists, many heading for cruise ports
or Disney World, where a magnetic-levitation train connection to
Orlando International Airport is planned for the early 1990s.
   ``We have to make the trip enjoyable for everyone _ from
tourists to business travelers _ or else we won't have any
riders,'' he said. ``But that shouldn't be hard. It's no fun
driving in most places now. It's not that fun to fly, and I don't
think there are many people who like taking the bus. What's left?''
   The trains could be rolling as early as 1994 with fares from
Miami to Tampa between $30 to $69, Stevenson said.
   Meanwhile, he believes rail travel will become more attractive
as traffic snarls and gridlock worsen around Florida, one of the
nation's fastest growing states.
   ``There is no way we can build enough roads to keep pace with
traffic demands,'' said Stevenson. ``But what we do have is an
infrastructure of 200,000 miles of track around the country ready
to be used.''
   Worldwide, there are between 2,500 and 3,000 miles of high-speed
rail, including the 125 mph Amtrak link from Washington to New
York, said Raul Bravo, a rail consultant working on a proposed
European rail network that could add more than 15,000 miles to the
high-speed system by the year 2000.
   Amtrak last year reported a record 21.5 million passengers and
similar projections are being made for 1989, said spokesman
Clifford Black.
   ``We've ignored the train for about 40 years,'' said Stevenson.
``That's too long.''

   The modern consumer movement that ``Nader's
Raiders'' spawned 20 years ago in Washington is quietly thriving at
the grass-roots level and braced for the challenges of the next
decade, advocates say.
   The movement is more diverse and has a lower profile than when
Ralph Nader led 250 students from the country's top schools to
Washington to research what, if anything, government was doing for
consumers, advocates say. But they contend that the movement is
every bit as strong and influential.
   ``It's not as visible, it's not as much here but it's spread
into the hustings,'' said Robert Fellmeth, one of seven lawyers
dubbed ``Nader's Raiders'' in January 1969.
   They earned the tag after presenting a well-documented report of
inaction by the Federal Trade Commission, which then had primary
responsibility for consumer protection.
   The proliferation of consumer advocacy organizations since then
is a testament to the health of their movement, says veteran raider
Clarence Ditlow.
   ``We're almost as big and varied as the government,'' said
Ditlow, who heads the Center for Auto Safety, which has lead the
fight for standard safety features such as seat belts and air bags
in cars and whose annual car report has become a mainstay for
buyers.
   Nader's Raiders and their associates have founded or helped to
establish more than 35 different consumer advocacy groups,
according to a statement distributed at a recent 20th anniversary
conference.
   Fellmeth, a law professor at the University of San Diego, said
that in its infancy the movement focused on direct political and
legislative action at the federal level.
   The advocates acknowledge they made few advances after Ronald
Reagan was elected president in 1980, being forced instead to
protect the statutes and agencies they had helped create against
his anti-government philosophy.
   ``We could not have envisioned Reagan putting the 1980s on hold
while he built a government of the Exxon, by the GM, for the
Duponts,'' said Nader in a wry parody of the Constitution's
preamble.
   Consumer activists say legislation is needed to renew and
strengthen the mandate of the Consumer Product Safety Commission,
which has not been reauthorized by Congress since its 1972
inception.
   While calling for a stronger federal hand, groups have shifted
much of their emphasis to the state and local level.
   ``It's begun to have a grass-roots kind of entity and it's now
begun to spread into state capitals and it's become more of a
direct democracy,'' said Fellmeth at the recent Raider reunion.
   ``I think you're going to be seeing the consequences of that
groundwork in the 1990s,'' predicted Fellmeth.
   Some point to stricter state than federal laws against
pesticides on foods, state consumer utility boards, consumer
representation on public utility commissions and programs like
Florida's time dollar-service exchange as harbingers of the future
efforts.
   Health care, on the other hand, has the highest priority on the
national consumer agenda, the activists say. Issues to be resolved
are who delivers it, who makes treatment decisions, how to control
costs and how to provide long-term and catastrophic care.
   Nader and others say there also needs to be a greater push for
group buying associations and publicly-financed, possibly elected,
consumer representation before federal and state regulatory
agencies.
   Nader also points out that publicly-financed campaigns and an
end to honoraria for elected officials remain on the agenda.
   Still others, like Chuck Hill of the Consumer Law Center and
Mark Silberfeld of Consumers Union, say more emphasis will have to
be put on the concerns of low-income people.
   Meanwhile, traditional consumer organizations have allied
themselves with adversaries on specific issues.
   Consumer Federation of America and the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group recently joined with the Association of American
Trial Lawyers to warn the public about a potentially dangerous
drain cleaner. The American Insurers Association has joined with
several consumers groups and is bankrolling the newly-created
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.
   These ``shifting coalitions,'' as Silberfeld termed them, are a
part of a more sophisticated approach that consumer advocates are
likely to continue.

<HEAD>Government Cheats Itself Out of Millions, Says GAO Water Report</HEAD>

   The government has cheated itself out of
millions of dollars by misinterpreting legislation that specifies
who uses federally subsidized water, says a report released Monday
by the General Accounting Office.
   The congressman who wrote the law blames the Interior Department
and the GAO advises Congress to close loopholes that let Interior
interpret the law the way it does.
   The law was written for states where water is scarce _
essentially, the West. Farmers in California have been the greatest
beneficiaries of the loopholes.
   ``Wealthy farmers in California's Central Valley have subverted
the intent of federal water laws, and top Interior Department
officials aware of the abuse declined to take corrective action,''
said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.
   Miller said he rewrote the law in 1982 governing the cost of
federal water to Western farmers so that large farms would receive
a limited amount of cheap, federally subsidized water.
   Only farms of 960 acres or less would be eligible.
   But owners of large farms got around the law by reorganizing
into 960-acre tracts that qualified for the subsidies.
   ``Congressional expectations have not been met,'' said the GAO,
which is Congress' investigative arm.
   ``For all practical purposes, these smaller landholdings
continue to be operated collectively as single large farms, much as
they were before being reorganized,'' said the investigators'
report.
   The Interior Department, however, said it is following
congressional intent.
   ``We're carrying out the law,'' said Joe Hunter, spokesman for
the Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation. Hunter said he had
not seen the GAO report and did not want to comment on specifics in
it.
   However, the report itself tends to back up Hunter's contention
that the agency is meeting its legal requirement. ``Interior
cautioned that it is not convinced that the Congress expected to
apply the 960-acre limit to land being operated as one unit,'' the
report said.
   ``The GAO believes that by amending the act as GAO recommends,
the Congress will make clear its expectations,'' said the report.
   The Interior Department also told the GAO it did not see the
law's purpose as a method of enhancing government revenues.
   When GAO investigators looked into the books of farmers who had
subdivided to see how much money was being saved, they found four
cases in which the owners or lessees were able to pay a total of
about $1.3 million less in 1987 for the federal irrigation water
than they would have paid if their respective multiple landholdings
had been considered as large farms.
   ``This $1.3 million represents reduced revenues to which the
federal government would have been entitled, and these reduced
revenues likely will continue to occur annually unless the act is
amended,'' the GAO report said.

<TEXT>
   Savings and loan executives, gathering Sunday for
their 97th annual convention at the close of the industry's most
traumatic year since the Depression, are bracing for more tough
times ahead.
   Three months after Congress authorized $50 billion to close or
rescue an estimated 500 failed S&amp;Ls, the still-solvent survivors
face the prospect of shrinking balance sheets, takeover by
commercial banks and increasingly stiffer competition in what many
economists expect will be a sluggish home financing market.
   The legislation signed by President Bush on Aug. 9 provided one
immediate and substantial benefit to the industry: It closed failed
institutions or replaced their high-cost deposits with federal
money, relieving healthy S&amp;Ls of the burden of competing by
matching the high rates.
   But, the new law also imposes tough new capital requirements on
thrifts. That will protect taxpayers by forcing S&amp;L owners to back
their lending with more of their own money, but it has the industry
scrambling.
   According to James Barth, chief economist of the federal Office
of Thrift Supervision, nearly 1,000 of 2,600 solvent S&amp;Ls
nationwide, holding 60 percent of the industry's assets, are short
of capital. That does not include the nearly 300 already seized by
the government.
   Institutions can meet the new standards in three ways: by
retaining profits, by attracting outside investors or by shrinking.
So far, most capital-deficient thrifts are choosing the third
option.
   Few have profits to retain. The industry as a whole lost $7.2
billion in the first six months of this year, following a record
loss of $13.4 billion in all of 1988. In the absence of profits,
outside investors are difficult to find. The result: S&amp;Ls
anticipated the new capital standards by shedding $28 billion in
assets in June, July and August.
   ``For years, we're going to be seeing unprecedented, massive,
massive restructuring,'' Barth said. ``Then, if something happens,
like a recession, things will really get interesting.''
   The new law makes it easier for commercial banks to merge with
thrifts or buy their deposits and branches. That is causing the
``somewhat perverse result'' that some institutions are meeting the
higher capital requirement by selling deposits, branches and
subsidiaries they need to remain profitable over the long haul,
Barth said.
   S&amp;Ls, by July 1, 1991, also will have to devote themselves more
exclusively to home financing _ 70 percent of assets, up from 60
percent currently.
   That's taking effect as advancing technology is making it easier
for competitors to enter the mortgage market and on the eve of a
decade expected to see the housing sector weaken in response to the
aging of the Baby Boom generation.
   ``However you varnish it ... weak aggregate demand for housing
... is going to be part of the picture of the 1990s,'' James W.
Christian, chief economist of the major S&amp;L trade group, wrote
recently.
   He estimated that new households in the 1990s will require 12
million to 13 million new housing units, down from 15 million units
in the 1980s and 17.5 million units in the 1970s.
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,
said S&amp;Ls, because of developments in mortgage financing, will have
to compete harder for a piece of the shrinking pie.
   The home financing business has been divided into three parts
because an increasing proportion of mortgages are securitized, he
said. Large congressionally chartered companies like Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac buy mortgage loans and then sell securities backed by
the mortgages.
   That means the investor buying the security, such as an
insurance company or pension fund, actually supplies the money for
the mortgage, reducing thrifts' share of the funding part of the
business.
   That leaves two other areas of business:
   _mortgage servicing, or collecting monthly payments from
homeowners.
   _mortgage origination, signing up the homeowner in the first
place.
   But since anyone can sell a mortgage to Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, S&amp;Ls no longer have a lock on mortgage origination, Ely said.
And, because most thrifts are too small to compete effectively
against large, computerized mortgage-servicing operations, they are
losing that part of the business as well, he said.
   In June, for the first time since the government began keeping
track 19 years ago, commercial banks originated more mortgages than
S&amp;Ls. Banks had 38 percent of the market, followed by 35 percent
for S&amp;Ls and 19 percent for mortgage companies.
   All this is causing problems for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, the savings industry's largest trade association. Its
membership is down _ 2,758 institutions in August compared to 2,990
at the beginning of the year. Attendance is down at this year's
convention: 3,595 versus 5,500 in Honolulu last year.
   The league has cut its staff by 50 positions to 430. Its budget
shrank by 11 percent this year and will shrink another 11 percent,
to $27 million, next year.
   Frederick L. Webber, president of the league, says the group
isn't threatened by the changes. If banks buy S&amp;Ls, ``our programs,
our seminars ... are there to help them open up new markets,'' he
said.
   Meantime, the association's immediate goal is to change what it
considers the most objectionable provisions of the S&amp;L law, he said.
   Even though the league justified asking taxpayers to pay for the
bailout by portraying S&amp;Ls as providers of the American dream of
home ownership, it would like to keep the mortgage test at 60
percent of assets.
   The group also would like to reduce the industry's contribution
to the bailout. The 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks, which are
industry owned and provide low-cost loans to member S&amp;Ls, are being
tapped for $2.6 billion in retained earnings through 1991. And,
they're supposed to contribute $300 million a year to help pay the
interest on government borrowing for the bailout.
   `We're not trying to weasel out of it, we're trying to remain
viable,'' Webber said. ``We are confident ... there will be a
successful thrift industry provided we can correct some of the more
onerous parts of'' the S&amp;L bill.

   When M. Danny Wall took over as the nation's
top savings and loan regulator on July 1, 1987, he swiftly ordered
the heavy glass door leading to his office propped open.
   A trim, balding man with a neatly trimmed beard and a fondness
for three-piece suits, Wall intended his move to be a symbolic
change from the way his predecessor, Edwin Gray, conducted affairs
at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   But the gesture instead has become a symbol of the turbulence
Wall has encountered during his tenure at what is now the Office of
Thrift Supervision. Three times in 16 months the man who walked
through the door was Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire Charles H. Keating
Jr., head of a California-based savings and loan that collapsed at
an expected cost to the taxpayers of $1.5 billion to $2 billion.
   ``My method of operation ... is if somebody wants to talk to me,
I'm going to listen to them,'' Wall said, defending his handling of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. ``... You can't close your
door to your constituents,'' added the 50-year-old regulator, who
came to Washington as an aide to GOP Sen. Jake Garn of Utah.
   But even leaving the Lincoln case aside, Wall has absorbed his
share of criticism, first for refusing to admit the need for a
multibillion dollar bailout until after George Bush had won the
1988 presidential election.
   Second, critics fault the S&amp;L rescue deals Wall put together in
a headlong rush at the end of last year, committing the government
to spending some $40 billion Congress had not yet appropriated.
   But it is his handling of the Lincoln case, the nation's largest
thrift failure, that has generated the fiercest attacks, including
a call to resign from House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas. Wall says he won't quit, and is expected to
testify later this month before the House panel.
   In three hearings this fall, the committee has compiled reams of
testimony focusing on Wall's decision to ignore a 1987
recommendation by his agency's San Francisco office to take control
of Lincoln _ a decision that ultimately delayed the seizure until
April of this year.
   Wall, in a recent interview, said he realizes now that Lincoln
executives were engaged in an intentional effort to hide their
allegedly fraudulent activities. But he said his decision to meet
with the politically influential Keating _ a heavy contributor to
the election campaigns of five senators, four Democrats and one
Republican _ was proper.
   M. Danny Wall, the M stands for Melvin, arrived in Washington in
1975 as the top aide to the newly elected Garn. His fortunes rose
with Garn, and when Republicans took control of the Senate in 1980,
Garn became chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and Wall
became staff director.
   In the Senate, Wall acquired a reputation as energetic, bright,
accessible and straightforward, willing to meet with the financial
industry interest groups, even when he and his boss were pushing
legislation they opposed.
   ``You could always go out with Danny and have a drink with
Danny. ... He did a good job,'' recalled Kenneth A. Guenther,
executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of
America.
   After Republicans lost control of the Senate in 1986, Wall began
to look for a command of his own. With Gray's term ending, the
White House was looking for someone with the political skills
necessary to deal with Congress and the S&amp;L industry in the rough
period ahead.
   Wall was confirmed with bipartisan support, but it didn't take
long for the honeymoon to deteriorate. He became known for his
ever-escalating estimate of the scope of the savings and loan
debacle and his credibility in Congress suffered.
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va., a
persistent _ and ultimately accurate _ critic of Wall's assessment
of the industry's condition, said Wall is unsuited by temperament
and professional background for the ``tough cop'' role of top
regulator.
   ``You have to really be a tough person and you have to be
willing to sit down with a guy eyeball-to-eyeball and say, `I'm
going to take your business away from you,''' Ely said. ``I don't
think Danny had that in him.''
   Indeed, according to Barton Naylor, a former Democratic aide on
the banking committee, Democratic staffers discovered when Wall
left that the first number on his telephone speed dial was to a
lobbyist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
   Gonzalez's committee plans at least three more hearings on
Lincoln, and has scheduled an appearance from Wall on Nov. 21.
Despite the steady drumbeat of negative publicity, Wall has no
plans to resign and said he will be vindicated by the public when
he gets a chance to tell his side of the story.
   ``I'm not saying we're lily white in the situation, not at
all,'' Wall said. ``... But fair play clearly has not been evident,
much less due process.''
   Ely predicted Wall will hang on as long as he has Garn's support.
   ``Jake is very loyal to people who have been loyal to him,'' he
said. ``I don't think the administration is going to lean on Danny
to resign because they don't want to offend the ranking minority
member on the Senate Banking Committee. They need him too much.''
   Garn, in a telephone interview, said House Democrats, who bowed
to lobbyists by refusing to force the S&amp;L industry to pay for its
own bailout in 1986, are looking for a scapegoat.
   ``In all the years I've been in Washington, I've never known
anybody who's been more honest than Dan Wall. It's too bad some of
his detractors don't show equal devotion to the truth,'' he said.

<HEAD>Airline Smoking Ban Succeeds, but Other Proposed Restrictions Stall</HEAD>

   Like two armies nervously peering at each
other across a no-man's land, tobacco state members of Congress and
their anti-smoking colleagues are not resting easily these days.
   With the Senate poised to send President Bush a bill forbidding
smoking on virtually all domestic airline flights _ probably on
Tuesday _ cigarette opponents say they are ready to move on to
other restrictions. Yet in the same breath, they warn that the
well-heeled tobacco lobby can't be counted out yet.
   ``They've got lots of money and there are members from tobacco
states with important positions to keep legislation from reaching
the floor,'' says Rep. Michael Andrews, D-Texas, who has introduced
legislation to boost the federal levy on cigarettes.
   Tobacco industry supporters insist that approval of the airline
smoking ban does not translate into retreats on other issues, where
they say they are stronger. But they caution that the other side is
motivated and gradually gaining steam.
   ``The success of the ban was certainly a psychological blow but
not a significant economic blow, because there just aren't that
many cigarettes smoked on airplanes,'' says Rep. H. Martin
Lancaster, D-N.C., whose district is one of the nation's leading
tobacco growers. ``But support here for the tobacco industry is
steadily eroding. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure
that out.''
   The nation's $36-billion-a-year cigarette industry loses few
fights on Capitol Hill. Congress enacted a ban on smoking on short
airline flights in 1987, required a series of warning labels on
cigarette packs in 1984, and in 1982 doubled the excise tax to its
current 16 cents per pack.
   The question now becomes whether the industry _ whose lobby is
one of the best-financed in the capital _ stands to lose more
battles.
   The hoppers in the House and Senate are overflowing with bills
aimed at smoking and the industry that profits from it.
   Some would limit cigarette print advertising to words, with no
models, scenery or color permitted. Radio and television
advertising is already banned. Others would boost the excise tax,
in one case using some of the extra money for public service
announcements on the evils of tobacco.
   Still other bills would limit the placement of cigarette vending
machines, ban smoking by students in federally supported schools,
halt government efforts to improve tobacco exports, and give the
Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate the substance.
   ``This is the only legal product in America that when used
according to the manufacturer's directions will kill you,'' Rep.
Richard Durbin, D-Ill., sponsor of the airline smoking ban bills,
says to explain why tobacco products have become such a legislative
target.
   Durbin and his allies say their other measures are likely to get
a boost from the success of the airline smoking legislation. A
public that is gradually purchasing fewer cigarettes is also making
such efforts more acceptable in Congress.
   ``There's a changing political atmosphere on the tobacco
issue,'' Andrews says.
   The range of bills is wide, but few if any of them appear likely
to move out of congressional committees in the near future.
   Tobacco state lawmakers _ including Chairman Ernest Hollings,
D-S.C., of the Senate Commerce Committee and Chairman Charles Rose,
D-N.C., of the House Agriculture tobacco subcommittee _ have
strategic positions that let them stifle anti-cigarette measures.
   Congressional leaders are also loath to move too strongly
against tobacco interests, knowing they need the votes of lawmakers
from those states on other issues. House Democratic Whip William H.
Gray III, D-Pa., made a crucial speech when House-Senate
negotiators were working on the new airline smoking ban that helped
preserve smoking on a handful of flights.
   Another obstacle confronting cigarette foes is the broader range
of enemies they face in their more ambitious efforts. On the
airline smoking issue, ban supporters had just one opponent: the
tobacco industry.
   But any effort to raise excise taxes runs into opposition from
the alcohol, fuel, telephone and other industries that face similar
levies. Advertising restrictions are opposed by publishers,
advertisers and civil libertarians who say the move would violate
constitutional free speech protections.
   ``I don't see anything coming at us with the speed or intensity
that airline issue represented,'' says spokesman Walker Merryman of
the Tobacco Institute, the cigarette industry's trade group.
   Yet neither does anyone expect the tobacco opponents to stop
trying.
   ``You've got enough zealous people in the two houses of Congress
who see great political gain in this,'' says Sen. Terry Sanford,
D-N.C. ``We have to continue to resist this, but there's no
question they're motivated.''

   Public television stations, those
non-commercial bastions of civility and good taste, are taking off
the white gloves in an uncivil war over, ahem, money.
   With half the nation's viewers now able to tune in two or more
public TV channels, public TV executives increasingly are tripping
over one another as they go hat-in-hand to viewers and private
backers.
   Nearly one in five viewers can choose among four or more public
TV stations. And many of those stations are trying to raise money
by showing the same programs to the same persnickety audiences.
   ``It can strike terror in your heart when the main source of
your revenue is local fund raising (and) over-the-air pledging,''
says Peter Downey, a senior vice president at the Public
Broadcasting Service.
   The overcrowding problem has gotten bad enough that executives
from some 50 public TV stations that compete in the same cities met
in Dallas in September under the auspices of PBS to talk about
their grievances.
   Downey said the meeting, the first of its kind, was designed to
cool tensions that have been simmering over new stations in a
number of cities.
   ``The situation seems to have been getting worse in the last
four or five years,'' Downey said in a recent interview. ``The pot
just seemed to boil over a bit.''
   Downey said much of the problem stems from the Public
Telecommunications Facilities Program, which makes federal matching
funds available to help build non-profit communications projects
such as public TV stations. The fund is administered by the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a
Commerce Department agency.
   The fund was designed to encourage broadcasters to build public
stations in areas previously unserved. Downey said two to four
stations per year are being created, but mostly in larger
population centers.
   ``Over the years there's been a lot of talk about birth control,
to change NTIA's policies to discourage establishment of more
stations, particularly in markets already served,'' Downey said.
   There are about 40 cities in which two or more public TV
stations compete. And although there aren't any hard statistics
available on what kinds of bites these stations are taking out of
one another's audiences and donations, they all feel the pressure,
public TV executives say.
   ``We end up on the air asking the same people for donations,''
said Fred Esplin, general manager of KUED, a Salt Lake City, Utah,
public station that competes with KBYU-TV in nearby Provo. ``A few
people give to both of us, but most people give to one or the
other.''
   ``It's something that we think about all the time,'' said Joyce
Campbell, senior vice president and station manager of WETA in
Washington, where viewer donations comprise 66 percent of the
station's budget.
   At the Dallas meeting, station executives discussed pooling
facilities and staffs. PBS officials also urged them to
differentiate their programming so everyone doesn't show the same
PBS workhorses such as ``Masterpiece Theater'' and ``Nova.''
   For example, it was pointed out that WHMM in Washington, which
shares the greater Washington-Baltimore market with WETA and
Maryland Public Television, shows many programs aimed at
Washington's predominantly black audience.
   In Utah, KBYU-TV, which is owned by the Morman Church, has tried
to distance itself from the mainline PBS programming shown by KUED.
   ``We really have a children's niche and a family niche in this
market,'' station manager Mel Rogers said. ``Lassie'' and
``Flipper'' might be found on KBYU, and Rogers said the station's
Lawrence Welk show is the most popular public TV program in Utah.
``KUED aims more for the yuppie market.''
   KYBU and KUED have agreed to hold regular ``summit meetings'' to
discuss differences and, sometimes, divvy up programs.
   One sore point that competing public stations haven't resolved
is program costs. Stations buy programs from PBS based upon their
ability to pay, which means newer stations usually pay less for the
same programs than their more entrenched competitors.
   Don Johnson, president of KRMA-TV in Denver, estimated that his
station pays ``three to four times as much per program'' for the
same programs as Denver's smaller public station, KBDI-TV. There is
nearly 50 percent duplication of programming between the two
stations, Johnson said.
   He said PBS was working on a new payment formula for programs.
   As for local fund-raising, the presence of two stations ``makes
it very difficult to go out into the business community to attempt
to get underwriting,'' Johnson said.
   Corporation for Public Broadcasting figures show that viewer
donations to public TV stations nationwide grew from about $75
million in 1980 to more than $220 million in 1987, not counting
inflation.
   The number of subscribers grew from about 2.3 million to 4.5
million in the same period.
   Total public TV income grew from a little under $600 million in
1980 to over $1 billion in 1987, unadjusted for inflation.

   A $305 billion defense bill that takes a chunk
out of President Bush's request for Star Wars but leaves other big
programs mostly intact comes under congressional scrutiny this week
amid some grousing over the compromise package.
   A handful of Republicans and Democrats have expressed opposition
to the military blueprint for fiscal 1990. Some complain that the
legislation is a ``jobs bill,'' while others say two types of
land-based nuclear missile is too many.
   ``On nuclear weapons, we produced a strategic mush that decides
absolutely nothing,'' Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., a member of the
House Armed Services Committee, said Friday. ``We need a strategic
diet that cancels some nuclear weapons to end duplication.''
   All the same, indications are that the defense bill for the
fiscal year that began Oct. 1 will win approval in the House and
Senate, and receive the president's signature. The House may take
up the legislation this week.
   Also this week, Democrats and Republicans will continue their
efforts to nail down an agreement that would allow congressional
passage of a debt-limit extension and a deficit-reduction bill.
   The government has reached its borrowing limit of $2.8 trillion,
and default will occur unless the ceiling is extended early in the
week.
   Agreement also could allow Congress to try to roll back the
$16.1 billion in cuts in most federal programs imposed under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law on Oct. 1.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said Thursday that the defense bill
``reflects support for the president, particularly in those areas
where he felt it essential at the bargaining table in the arms
control arena,''
   The bill, adopted by House and Senate conferees after nearly two
months of wrangling, slashes $1.1 billion from Bush's request of
$4.9 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known
as Star Wars.
   The cut represents a 7 percent drop from the amount spent on the
program in fiscal 1989 and marks the first year that SDI has
suffered a decrease in spending.
   On the other strategic programs _ the MX nuclear missile, the
Midgetman missile and the B-2 stealth bomber _ the administration
experienced limited cuts. The defense bill trimmed $150 million
from the approximately $1.2 billion Bush sought for the two
land-based missiles and provided money for two B-2 bombers _ one
less than the administration sought in fiscal 1990.
   The most contentious issues were Bush's proposal to cancel 10
programs, including the Navy's F-14D Tomcat jet fighter and the
Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey.
   The congressional negotiators decided to continue two programs _
the F-14D and the AHIP helicopter _ for one more year before
killing the program, and postponed a decision on the V-22 Osprey
and the Phoenix missile. The conferees accepted the
administration's plan to kill six other programs, including the
SSN-688 submarine, the F-15 aircraft and the M-88 tank recovery
vehicle.
   Conservative organizations, including the Center for Peace and
Freedom, have called on Bush to veto the bill because of the cut in
Star Wars spending. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he ``would
have preferred a higher level of funding for SDI.''
   But lawmakers have contended all along that support for the
program is diminishing, and defense analysts said the
administration was clearly concerned about other issues.
   ``It's significant that the administration did better on B-2, MX
and Midgetman than it did on SDI,'' John Isaacs, head of the
liberal group, Council for a Livable World, said Friday. ``The
priority for this administration is other issues, not SDI.''
   Among the other provisions of the defense bill is the barring of
any money for the F-16 aircraft _ one of the Air Force's top
programs _ ``until it shapes up and takes close air support
seriously,'' said the House Armed Services Committee in its report
on the legislation. The administration had sought $3.4 billion for
the program.
   The bill trims about $500 million from the troubled Trident II
missile, provides only about $900 million of the $1.1 billion the
administration requested for the Advanced Tactical Fighter and adds
$848 million for the National Guard and Reserves.
   The bill also eliminates 14,500 positions in Europe associated
with the intermediate-range nuclear missiles, banned under the
U.S.-Soviet treaty signed in December 1987, and includes
Senate-passed burden sharing provisions.
   ``We're saying to our NATO allies, the percentage of U.S. forces
in Europe is not going to increase. If you reduce your forces, ours
are going to be reduced too unless some other country makes up for
it,'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said Thursday.
   The bill also eliminates a Senate-approved provision that would
have given federal agents the authority to shoot down a plane
suspected of transporting illegal narcotics into the United States.

   Casino gambling supporters, fresh from a
victory in a citywide referendum, plan to emphasize economic
development and local control when they ask a skeptical Gov. Evan
Bayh and the Indiana General Assembly to approve gambling
legislation.
   Voters in this economically depressed steel town endorsed casino
gambling by a 60 percent to 40 percent margin on Saturday, setting
the stage for a legislative battle in the 1990 General Assembly
over the proposal to allow casino-hotels to be built on the Lake
Michigan shore.
   ``An opportunity for jobs and economic revitalization _ that's
going to be the pitch,'' said Rep. Earline S. Rogers, a Democrat
from Gary. ``In the absence of the state coming up with a way to
solve our problems, we've come up with something ourselves.''
   Bayh said he believed the referendum result is important but not
compelling, given a voter turnout of just 32.3 percent.
   ``I'm opposed to casino gambling, but I'm willing to sit down
and look at all the arguments for and against, and I have yet to do
that,'' said Bayh. ``You never say never.''
   ``When you're in public office you have to hear people out and
see if they have a compelling argument that hasn't been
considered,'' the governor said.
   Mayor Thomas V. Barnes and other Gary casino advocates,
including representatives of the gambling industry, believe the
city could support five lakefront casino-hotels, which would
produce 25,000 casino-related jobs and an additional 10,000 jobs
for construction workers.
   Those figures, coupled with the support shown in the non-binding
referendum, make a strong case, casino advocates believe.
   The decline of the steel industry in the early '80s caused the
loss of thousands of jobs. Once the state's second-largest city,
Gary dropped to fourth as its population declined from 190,000 to
135,000.
   ``The more we tell our story, the more people look at the
numbers, the more inclined they are to look at the opportunity
favorably,'' said Robert Spolyar, a lobbyist for Resorts
International, a casino operator.
   Rogers said she also plans to appeal to the traditional Hoosier
belief in self-help and self-determination.
   ``This is a state that believes in local determination, that
believes in home rule, and we're going to make the legislators
prove that that's what they believe in,'' she said.
   But the casino advocates know the battle won't be easy. Like
Bayh, several legislative leaders say they're not convinced casino
gambling is best for Gary and for the state.
   Asked what she would say to the governor, who carried the
heavily Democratic Gary area by wide margins last year, Rogers
said, ``One word: Count. Count the supporters of this issue. Count
the jobs. Count the revenue.
   ``I'm certain wen he balances that with his personal
reservations, that will outweigh his personal beliefs,'' she said.
   Other legislators predicted the governor's position will
determine what the Legislature does.
   ``I don't think you're going to see a lot of people both in his
party and in the Republican Party feel there's any necessity to
send a bill down there that's going to be vetoed,'' said House
Republican Speaker Paul S. Mannweiler of Indianapolis. The house,
evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, has a speaker
from each party.
   That decision could involve questions about the morality of
gambling more than arguments over jobs and local control, said
Mannweiler. Because of the morality issue, he argued, the casino
issue is different from past economic development appeals made by
legislators other parts of the state.
   ``Even though Gary says this is a local-option issue, that we
ought to help Gary help themselves, casino gambling is not somthing
I look very favorably on seeing in the state of Indiana anywhere,''
said Mannweiler.
   ``If we (in Indianapolis) would have asked for legalized
prostitution, I would certainly see why somebody someplace else in
the state would want to vote against it,'' he said.
   But other lawmakers contend Gary's problems are so urgent that
some people who would normally oppose casinos ``might be persuaded
to give it a try,'' said Senate Assistant Minority Leader Louis J.
Mahern, a Democrat from Indianapolis.
   ``I believe that anybody in the Legislature who rejects the idea
because of the moral issue of gambling almost has a burden on them
to come up with their solution to Gary's problems,'' said Mahern.

   The savings and loan industry's largest trade
group Sunday announced the formation of a foundation designed to
get thrift institutions more involved in housing loans to people of
modest means.
   The Housing Opportunities Foundation, established with $500,000
as an affiliate of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, will
provide ``how-to'' information to savings institutions and track
trends and issues related to home ownership.
   But its main focus will be advising the 12 regional Federal Home
Loan Banks on how to administer a new affordable housing program
established by S&amp;L legislation enacted in August.
   The regional banks, created by Congress but owned by S&amp;Ls, are
required to provide $50 million a year from 1990 through 1993, $75
million in 1994 and $100 million a year thereafter.
   Robert B. O'Brien Jr., a New Jersey savings and loan executive
who will be chairman of the foundation, says he believes the money
should be used to provide discounted mortgages for people who would
not otherwise be able to own their homes.
   Next year, the $50 million subsidy should be able to provide a
discount on $2.5 billion worth of mortgages to 500,000 homebuyers,
he said.

<TEXT>
   Oil-producing Gulf countries are linking
up with refineries and retailers around the world in an effort to
ensure secure outlets for their crude, said a study released Sunday.
   The trend could make the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries ``less relevant, at least in its ability to fix
crude oil prices,'' said the study, conducted by Gulf International
Bank.
   The study contended that integrated producers will focus more on
the prices of refined products rather than crude.
   ``As the countries with large excess capacity make more inroads
into global ... integration, they will find their interests
diverging from the rest of OPEC and more in common with the major
oil companies,'' said the study by the Bahrain-based bank.
   For example, last year Saudi Arabia signed a 50 percent
partnership deal with U.S. oil giant Texaco Inc. that covers three
refineries and 11,450 retail stations in 23 states. The venture
guarantees an outlet for an estimated 615,000 barrels per day of
Saudi crude, the study said.
   Kuwait, a pioneer in spreading out to downstream ventures, is
guaranteed some 250,000 barrels per day through refineries and
retail stations it purchased outright in the United States and
Northern Europe.
   The study also said that Abu Dhabi has embarked on a similar
path with its acquisition of a 10 percent stake in Spain's largest
private oil refiner, Cia Espanola de Petroleos (CEPSA), and a 10
percent stake in the French company Total.
   Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are members of
the 6-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, along with Bahrain, Qatar
and Oman. The study predicted the latter three would follow a
different pattern by linking up with local oil producers.
   The study cited reports that these countries were pushing for
more involvement _ either through joint ventures or direct
purchases _ in America, Europe and Asia.
   Gulf oil and refining strategies will be discussed at a GCC oil
ministers meeting scheduled for Nov. 19 in Abu Dhabi. The following
day, the ministers will be joined by the rest of the members of the
11-nation Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
has long sought to integrate Arab oil operations.
