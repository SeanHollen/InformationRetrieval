<TEXT>
   The State Commission on Judicial Conduct
said Monday it has instituted formal proceedings against a Dallas
judge who said he gave a murderer a lighter sentence partly because
the two victims were ``queers.''
   The commission said a master appointed by the Texas Supreme Court
would hold a hearing on complaints against Judge Morris Jackson
Hampton, then report to the commission.
   Jackson said in December that he sentenced 18-year-old Richard
Bednarski to 30 years in prison instead of a maximum life sentence
because the two men he killed were homosexuals.
   Bednarski was convicted of the execution-style slayings of Tommy
Trimble, 34, and John Griffin, 27, who were found shot to death in a
Dallas park.
   ``I don't care much for queers cruising the streets picking up
teen-age boys. I've got a teen-age boy,'' Hampton said at the time.
   His remarks triggered protests from homosexual and civil
liberties groups, who staged a series of demonstrations and news
conferences in December to call for his removal from the bench.
   The commission said in a brief statement Monday that it had had a
``large number of complaints in this matter.''

   A British journalist says she and a colleague were
arrested four times for clandestinely filming rural areas of Romania
wrecked by President Nicolae Ceausescu's agricultural modernization
scheme.
   Sue Lloyd-Roberts said she managed to save her videocassettes
from confiscation by hiding them in her underwear whenever she was
arrested and handing authorities footage of home movies the two had
brought along.
   She and colleague Vivian Roberts overcame stringent restrictions
on foreign news coverage by entering the East bloc country posing as
tourists, she said.
   Her footage, broadcast on Independent Television News, showed
empty, brick-strewn fields where three villages had stood until last
fall, and a signpost with its place name replaced.
   These villages appeared on older maps which were already
unobtainable in Romania, Ms. Lloyd-Roberts said.
   An unidentified peasant woman was shown describing what had
happened: ``We worked all our lives. They destroyed everyone's home.
My house was knocked to the ground. They've made us live in new
blocks. Everything is wretched and miserable. What can be done?''
   The report said people spoke of villagers being killed resisting
militiamen who evicted them from their homes on 24 hours notice.
   The demolitions are part of Ceausescu's plan to raze up to 7,000
of Romania's 13,000 villages and resettle the population in
so-called agro-industrial centers.
   ``Ceausescu wants to create his `Communist Man,' and he has to
destroy the Romanian village because that's where the opposition to
communism is total,'' Ion Rativ, a Romanian emigre leader in London,
told ITN.
   In Bucharest, the capital, Ms. Lloyd-Roberts also filmed areas
demolished to make way for a vast palace Ceausescu is building for
himself.

<HEAD>Primeval Forest Is Last Refuge For Lowland Gorilla</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAYANGA, Central African Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is as remote a
place as you can get in Africa. The large-scale map of the Bayanga
region shows only primeval forest crossed by rivers with not a
single paved road.
   In this heart of darkness, hundreds of miles from the nearest
village, man's closest relative in the animal kingdom, the lowland
gorilla, has found his last refuge, a sanctuary of sorts from Pygmy
tribes and others who hunt him for his flesh and his hide.
   The gorilla is an endangered species and theoretically under
tough protection in the Central African Republic. But the government
has neither the money nor the personnel to enforce the protective
laws.
   There are two main groups of gorillas in Africa: the mountain
gorilla in Rwanda and eastern Zaire _ whose habitat and life style
have been fully explored _ and the lowland gorilla who remains
largely a mystery.
   The mountain gorilla can be seen from peak to peak and gradually
allows himself to be approached as he becomes familiar with human
beings.
   The lowland gorilla is supremely shy and elusive, explains
Richard W. Carroll of the Yale University School of Forestry and
Environmental Studies in New Haven, Conn.
   Carroll, who has made the gorilla his life's work, rarely gets
close enough to strike up an acquaintance. In more than five years'
work almost exclusively concentrated on the lowland gorilla, Carroll
has yet to get one accustomed to the human presence in the forest.
   He estimates that a desolate area of 40,000 square miles of
forest where the Central African Republic, Cameroon and the Congo
meet may still have at least 90,000 gorillas permanently settled
there. With the exception of rare logging camps along the rivers,
there is no human activity in this area, and the gorillas have until
recently remained undisturbed.
   In recent years, the logging camps have developed, and there has
been ``heavy illegal poaching'' for meat and the ivory of elephants
who are the other main inhabitants of the region.
   In the central market in Bangui, the Central African capital 220
miles to the east, stands are piled high smoked monkey meat, a local
delicacy.
   ``Gorillas taste like monkeys, only better,'' said Pierre Somse,
who is Carroll's Pygmy guide. ``And there is more of them.''
   Carroll, who lives in Bayembe with his wife and 3-year-old
daughter, has been trying to teach the Pygmies why the gorillas are
best left alone. It's an almost hopeless task.
   The Pygmies go after the gorillas with bows and arrows. But
larger Africans, those brought in to work the logging camps, use
rifles and even machine guns, Carroll said.
   ``They bribe the Pygmies to help them by giving them clothes and
liquor. In some areas, we find snares made of cables stolen from the
logging companies every few yards along trails used by the
gorrillas.''
   The gorillas eat the fleshy leaves of the ever-present
ginger-like Aframomum shrub, the fruit of tropical trees and the
eggs of termites.
   ``It's quite common to see a 400-pound silverback gorilla climb
more than 100 feet up into the trees to get at the fruit,'' Carroll
said. ``They love that more than anything.
   ``They will even build a nest up in the trees and sleep there.''
   In some areas on the ground, gorilla nests are visible every five
or six yards. But the gorillas scamper away when they sense a human
being approach.
   Carroll has been trying to persuade the Central African
government to set up a wildlife reserve in the remote southwestern
tip of the country. But in reality, the effort is useless unless the
other two governments in the area, the Congo and Cameroon, cooperate.
   Meanwhile, the poaching goes on. Even poorly paid wildlife guards
sometimes find it more worth their while to hunt gorillas and
elephants. And the dense forest paradoxically helps to protect the
poachers from the guards.
   ``It would help to be able to get a radio tag on the animals,''
Carroll said. ``We have to crawl on our hands and feet to get close
to them, and even then we don't see them 'til we are a foot or two
away. With a radio, we could find a place ahead of them and watch
them coming.''
   He said the gorillas share 90 percent of human genetic materials,
and, as such, are by far the closest animals to man.
   But he deplored the ineffectiveness of the present system of
control and the inability of local governments and European and
American organizations to stop the poaching.
   ``Recently we were in a camp on the Sangha River, where it forms
the border with the Congo. A Congolese gunboat came up the river and
ordered us to get out of there. We were clearly in the C.A.R.
(Central African Republic). But quite obviously, we were interfering
with their poaching.''

<HEAD>Former Police Chief's Son Charged in Art Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of a former city police chief has been
charged in a federal investigation of an alleged $3 million
art-theft ring centered in Cincinnati, federal authorities said
Monday.
   Jacob W. Schott Jr., 48, of the Cincinnati suburb of Wyoming was
arraigned Monday before U.S. Magistrate Robert Steinberg on a charge
of interstate transportation of stolen property.
   Schott, the third person to be charged in the case, filed notice
he would plead guilty to the charge in a plea bargain with federal
prosecutors.
   Schott agreed to cooperate with federal authorities and testify
against Teddy R. Rudder, an alleged member of the art-theft ring
already charged in the case, said Assistant U.S. Attorney John
DiPuccio.
   In exchange, federal authorities agreed not to file additional
charges against Schott, who was released on his own recognizance,
DiPuccio said.
   Schott is the son of the late Jacob W. Schott, who was Cincinnati
police chief from 1967 to 1970.
   He is accused of transporting an $80,000 painting stolen from a
Cincinnati house in February 1988 to Indianapolis, where is it was
sold to an art dealer, FBI agent Edward Boldt said.
   The oil painting by Edward Potthast, ``Women on Beach-Women in
Water,'' was later sold to a Santa Fe, N.M., art dealer. The Santa
Fe dealer saw the work listed in a bulletin on stolen art, and
reported it to the FBI, Boldt said.
   The charge against Schott carries a maximum sentence of 10 years
in prisona and $250,00 fine on conviction.
   The ring is accused of stealing items with an estimated worth of
$3 million from Cincinnati area homes, DiPuccio said.
   The FBI estimates it has recovered more than $500,000 worth of
items, most of them art objects.
   Rudder, 42, of Columbus, was arrested Feb. 7 and is jailed
without bond while his case is pending before a federal grand jury,
DiPuccio said.
   Rudder is charged with conspiracy to transport stolen property
interstate, and is charged with interstate travel to commit an arson
in an unrelated case, DiPuccio said.
   Federal authorities also have arrested Jerry Mulholland of
Cincinnati in the art-theft case.
   Mulholland, who is out on bond, is charged with an unrelated
count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, DiPuccio said.
   Federal authorities said they anticipate more arrests.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Ministry has refused to
extend the visas of eight Chinese businessmen who have been trying
to gain a foothold for their operations in South Korea, press
reports say.
   The eight include Hong Cheong Tak, vice chairman of China
Liaoning Ltd., a Hong Kong-based trade arm of China's Liaoning
province, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported Sunday.
   The agency said the ministry ordered the businessmen, who arrived
in December seeking to open company branches in Seoul, to leave by
March 2.
   Yonhap said the move indicates South Korea does not want Chinese
companies to open branches in the country on a long-term basis,
given that Seoul and Beijing have no formal diplomatic relations.
   South Korean businessmen are not allowed to stay in Beijing more
than three months, and China prevents South Korean firms from
opening branches there.
   China has promoted economic exchanges with South Korea in recent
years but has been reluctant to upgrade such relations, apparently
due to its ties with communist North Korea.

   Militant Sikh separatists shot and killed

in Punjab state, police and news reports said today.
   Five gunmen raided the home of Banta Singh in Gagubhua village in
Amritsar district late Sunday and fatally shot Singh and his sons at
point-blank range after separating them from the women in the
family, said area police chief Sanjeev Gupta.
   Sikhs militants who are campaigning for an independent homeland

   Moderate Sikhs want greater political autonomny for their rich
farming state but refuse to endorse the radicals' demand for
secession.
   United News of India said two policemen were shot and killed late
Sunday night by Sikh militants in the village of Deffarwal in
Hoshiarpur district.
   The latest slayings brought the total number of deaths blamed on
Sikh militants in Punjab to at least 325 this year.
   Last year, at least 2,440 deaths were blamed on the extremists.
   Sikhs, who make up about two percent of India's 880 million
people, say they are discriminated by Hindus, the country's
religious majority accounting for about 82 percent of its people.
   Sikhs comprise a slight majority in Punjab state.

   A train derailment caused an explosion and
fire involving four tanker cars, forcing the evacuation of thousands
of people from a residential and industrial area near downtown
Sunday night, authorities said.
   No injuries were immediately reported.
   The burning cars were among 17 that derailed from a CSX
Transportation train at the B.F. Goodrich Chemical plant, said Akron
Fire Chief George Romanoski.
   Nine of the cars carried highly flammable butane, CSX spokesman
Lloyd Lewis said by telephone from Jacksonville, Fla. The eight
other cars carried non-hazardous materials including vegetable oil,
clay and sand, he said.
   Allan Franks, a spokesman for the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency said one of the cars contained butadiene, which may produce
hazardous smoke when burned, but Lewis said the petroleum derivative
was not in any of the derailed cars.
   Romanoski said fires in three of the cars and been put out and
one car was still burning late Sunday night. Firefighters had
planned to allow the fourth car to burn itself out. The accident
occurred about 7:30 p.m., authorities said.
   Firefighters ran hoses up to the train to spread water on
adjoining cars to cool them and diminish the possibility they would
explode, he said.
   ``The area was evacuated because of the danger of explosion in
the surrounding tank cars,'' Romanoski said.
   At least 1,500 homes in an area within one-half mile of the plant
were evacuated, but the number of evacuees was not immediately
available, Mayor Don Plusquilic said.
   The evacuees were taken by bus to a high school and to the
University of Akron's Memorial Hall, said Scott Swearengin, the
county emergency management coordinator.
   Romanoski said people would not be allowed to return to their
homes until the fire was extinguished. He said he did not know when
that would be, ``but just as a yardstick, we're saying `plan on
being there overnight at least,''' he said.
   The train was not making a stop at the Goodrich plant, but was
using its tracks to pass through the area, said Mike Fletcher, plant
manager.
   The train, which had a total of 45 cars, was en route from
Willard, Ohio, to Akron and back to Willard, Lewis said. He did not
know where the train's next stop was scheduled. He said the train
carried a crew of three or four, and that no crew members were
injured.
   Lewis said investigators from CSX would arrive in Akron early
Monday morning. No cause for the accident had been determined Sunday
night, he said.
   Witnesses said flames from the burning tankers could be seen for
miles.
   Akron-area hospitals reported no injuries four hours after the
explosion, but some area residents reported feeling nauseated.

<HEAD>Publicized Drug Seizures Having Little Effect on Supply, Officials
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The large drug seizures announced with fanfare
by law enforcement authorities are having little effect on supplies
on the street, with dealers simply absorbing them as a cost of doing
business, federal officials say.
   ``Historically, a manager of drug couriers gives up one courier
who is body carrying (drugs) to take your attention away from four
more,'' said Bill Norsworthy, a Drug Enforcement Administration
agent at the El Paso Intelligence Center.
   ``People walk away from a brand new aircraft after one load and
consider that an expense of the trip,'' he said. ``The same goes for
boats, automobiles, campers. They expect to pay a price.''
   A better way to assess how the United States is doing in the war
on drugs is to ignore the ballyhoo about drug busts and concentrate
on the price and purity level of drugs on the street, says Sen.
Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.
   ``For too long, when we've asked whether or not our drug strategy
is working, the administration has cited record arrest and seizure
data,'' said Biden, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   A check of price and purity of drugs on the streets, Biden said,
reveals that ``cocaine and heroin on the streets are much cheaper
and more potent than they were five years ago.''
   In 1982, cocaine sold at the retail level at a nationwide range
of $2,000 to $3,000 per ounce and was 50 percent to 60 percent pure,
said DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty.
   In 1988, the street price of cocaine had dropped to $500 to
$2,000 per ounce and it was 80 percent pure, said Dougherty, who
said the information came from drug seizures, undercover drug buys,
intelligence gathered and records seized.
   The amount of drugs seized ``is not a dent'' in comparison with
what is coming into the country and being produced domestically,
said DEA spokesman Maurice Hill.
   Given the uncertainty over exactly how large the nation's illegal
drug market is, there are very few solid numbers about anything,
which gives drug busts and amounts seized a certain cachet.
   There is not even a clear total of the amount of seizures around
the country, the one number in the maze of drug statistics that
could be expected to be solid. One problem is that many different
agencies may take credit for the same bust.
   ``It's a quagmire,'' says Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson. ``If
you add them up, you'll find the government (claiming it) got 10
times what it actually seized. ... Everyone's trying to make
themselves look good.''
   Simpson outlined a hypothetical case in which the DEA provides
the intelligence on an incoming shipment, Air Force radar locates
the ship, a Navy jet spots the ship, the Coast Guard tracks it and
the final seizure is conducted by a local sheriff in Florida.
   ``Even if everyone was trying to do the right thing and no one
was trying to cheat, it would still be a nightmare'' to sort out the
various claims for responsibility, even though the agencies attempt
to note when they have assisted and when they have made a seizure
alone, he said.
   This problem was noted in 1983 by the General Accounting Office,
the investigative branch of Congress, and some efforts have been
made to correct it.
   ``We've tried to get all the federal agencies to call into the El
Paso Intelligence Center where they give each seizure an
identification number in case other police agencies claim it as
well,'' said Hill, who still acknowledged ``there's no real way'' to
tell how much the federal government seized last year.
   Norsworthy, who is special assistant to the special agent in
charge of EPIC, said that this program of giving each seizure a
Federal Drug Identification Number ``does avoid duplication.''
   However, Norsworthy said EPIC has not been providing annual
totals for federal drug seizures and the information it started
collecting only recently is limited because seizures must meet a
threshold _ such as a minimum of 1 pound of cocaine _ before they
are given identification numbers.
   In addition, ``absolutely no one'' is compiling figures of local
police seizures unless they choose to call in, he said.
   ``I don't believe that you will find a good, true figure (of the
total amount of drugs seized),'' said Norsworthy.
   Robert S. Weiner, a spokesman for the House Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control, said he's not concerned about some
duplication of seizure numbers, even if it's being done so agencies
will look better and possibly get more government money for their
efforts.
   ``Those guys need all the help they can get,'' Weiner said.
Committee Chairman Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., ``doesn't think you can
overplay the danger and hard work the front lines in law enforcement
have.''
   Disregarding the likelihood of duplication, the federal agencies
don't make it easy even to add up what they each claim to have
seized by maintaining different methods of calculation. Some compile
figures by calendar years, others by fiscal years that start Oct. 1;
some report on the number of pounds of drugs seized, others on
kilograms.
   Law enforcement agencies also repeatedly seize millions of
dollars in drug profits that go unclaimed, because anyone claiming
the money would have to prove it was his and say where it came from,
Hill said.
   ``I recall a little old lady way back in the early 70s who handed
me a shoe box full of $20 bills and said she was being paid to carry
it to a woman in Colombia,'' Norsworthy said. The woman, who
disclaimed any knowledge of the contents or the rightful owner, was
allowed to continue her trip and the government got the money since
no one claimed it.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Win or Lose, Tower Nomination Changes Assumptions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a conservative activist told the Senate
Armed Services Committee he had seen former Sen. John Tower drunk in
public, he set off a chain of events shattering the assumption that
the Senate will protect its own no matter what.
   Ill-founded or not, the assumption was that the nomination of the
feisty Texas Republican had relatively clear sailing in his quest to
be confirmed as President Bush's secretary of defense and that only
minimal attention would be paid to decades of rumors that he had a
serious drinking problem and a fondness for women to whom he was not
married.
   The testimony of conservative Paul Weyrich, who opposes some
Tower positions on defense issues, inspired a rush of similar
allegations. An ongoing FBI investigation was broadened.
   The result: Senators were forced to take the concerns about Tower
seriously. The nomination of the man who until three years ago was
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee was suddenly in deep
trouble in that committee and in the Senate itself.
   The dispute over Tower threatens the spirit of bipartisanship
which the president sought to build in his inaugural address little
more than a month ago.
   All 11 Democratic members of the Armed Services Committee voted
``no'' on Tower. All nine Republicans voted ``yes.''
   A similarly partisan split is possible when the full Senate
votes. In an attempt to prevent that and salvage his nomination,
Tower made an extraordinary promise on Sunday, vowing not to take a
single drink if he is confirmed.
   But the struggle over Tower and his alleged problems already has
brought a large degree of unaccustomed pain in a legislative
institution where progress is marked by the free flow of flattery,
in which all senators are invariably addressed as ``distinguished''
and ``honorable.''
   ``I can recall few equivalent instances on major issues in my
Senate career where my colleagues were so genuinely torn by the
evidence and undecided in their position until the time came to
vote,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the current Armed Services
chairman. Nunn voted ``no'' on Tower.
   Seventy-one members of the 101st Senate served when Tower was a
member.
   None has come forward with a personal account of ever seeing him
intoxicated or obviously out of control.
   Several senators, all Republicans, have insisted the opposite is
true, that they have observed Tower in periods of stress, during
late-night sessions of the Senate, during extensive overseas travel
and on numerous social occasions and never saw him intoxicated or
exercising poor judgment.
   But others, mostly Democrats, say they are deeply troubled by the
allegations assembled during the FBI investigation.
   These include Nunn, who, when he marked Tower's retirement from
the Senate in 1984, suggested the Texas senator might one day be
deservedly selected as secretary of defense and praised him for
``the background and knowledge that are indispensable in the defense
arena.''
   Senators voicing concern over Tower's alleged drinking problem
insist that his status as a former senator and as a principal arms
control negotiator in Geneva cannot outweigh concerns that a
secretary of defense must be alert and ready to respond to crisis 24
hours a day.
   ``We must not overlook a nominee's problems and subject him to
less rigid standards just because he once served in this body,''
said Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the Senate's president pro tem.
   In an interview, Byrd asserted that nothing has changed in the
way the Senate judges Cabinet-level nominees but added that ``a new
set of circumstances has come to center stage.''
   ``If the same nominee had come to center stage 100 years ago he
would have been rejected by his colleagues,'' Byrd contended.
   But others saw two centuries of Senate traditions under assault.
   ``It seems to me we are on the verge ... of tearing this place
apart,'' said Senate Republican Leader Robert C. Dole of Kansas, who
said unfounded allegations are ``coming out of the woodwork, over
the transom, under the door.''
   ``We have to have some fairness,'' Dole said. ``There could be
some hypocrisy around here.''
   Some senators say Tower's conduct in the past is being unfairly
judged by the changed standards of the present.
   ``This is a different era,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who
says he never saw Tower take a drink during working hours and never
saw him ``where he was not in complete control of his brain.''
   ``The whole country is drinking less, and that includes members
of the Senate _ everybody is more health-conscious,'' Stevens says.
   ``We did drink more in the 60's and 70's,'' he said. ``We had
more private time then. ... And if there is any place that will
bring up a drinking problem it is right here in the United States
Senate.''
   Stevens predicts that the Tower controversy will lead to a closer
examination of the private habits of all politicians.
   ``Yes, this has opened a can of worms,'' he said. ``But there
will be even more of a can of worms before this is over.
   ``People will ask all politicians, `Do you have a drinking
problem?'''

<HEAD>Farmers Face Higher Seed Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seed prices are higher as farmers head into the
spring planting season, largely because of last year's drought but
also because of huge additions to the government's conservation
program, according to Agriculture Department analysts.
   A survey of companies by the American Seed Trade Association last
August indicated that 45 percent of the planned seed corn production
was wiped out by the drought, the department's Economic Research
Service said.
   To make up the losses, many of the companies planned off-season
seed corn production in southern areas of the United States and in
South America.
   ``According to industry sources, the off-season production and
carryover stock should provide adequate seed corn supplies for
domestic use in 1989, if planted acreage doesn't exceed 78 million
acres,'' the agency said in a report. ``However, some popular
hybrids may be in short supply, requiring farmers to choose other
varieties.''
   Results of a survey among farmers to determine planting
intentions this spring will be issued by USDA on March 31.
   Corn plantings totaled 67.6 million acres last year, 65.7 million
in 1987 and 76.7 million in 1986.
   Two factors add up to planting costs: acreage and prices. And in
most cases, farmers are planting more acres this year, and prices
are higher. Overall, the USDA's ``prices paid'' index for all seeds
is expected to rise 10 percent to 15 percent from year-earlier
levels.
   ``Several seed corn firms have announced average increases of 10
percent to 15 percent in the spring price,'' the report said.
``Soybean, wheat, oat and barley seed prices tend to follow
commercial crop prices, which have climbed substantially since the
beginning of 1988. Cotton prices, however, have fallen over the last
year.''
   The Conservation Reserve Program, which has a goal of taking 40
million to 45 million acres of highly erodible land from crop
production by the end of 1990, has helped boost grass seed prices.
Under CRP contracts, farmers agree to plant the idled land with
grass or trees as protective cover.
   As of now, more than 28 million acres have been signed into the
CRP, with 90 percent of it to be planted to grass.
   The report said that if yields of grass seed are normal this
season, the supply of new seed should increase. But if CRP and
foreign demand for grass seed don't ease, higher prices can be
expected in 1989.
   ``Between 1985 and 1988, grass seed prices for timothy and annual
ryegrass increased 124 percent and 28 percent, respectively,'' the
report said.
   Meanwhile the reduced seed output because of last year's drought
has affected exports, mainly corn and soybeans.
   ``Exports are likely to be down in 1989, while imports are
expected to rise,'' the report said. ``However, neither exports nor
imports of corn and soybean seed typically constitute a large share
of total U.S. seed consumption.''
   However, seed exports are valuable, totaling a record of $374
million in the 1987 calendar year, up 1 percent from 1986, the
report said. The increase was primarily due to larger shipments of
soybean and vegetable seeds.
   The decline in corn seed exports in 1988 is likely to mostly be
felt by Italy, Mexico, Canada, France, Turkey, Greece and Japan, the
report said. Major soybean seed buyers are Italy, Mexico, Canada,
Turkey and Japan.
   ``While the full effects of the drought on seed corn exports will
not be known until later in 1989, the two major seed corn export
markets, France and Italy, showed declines of 18 percent and 51
percent respectively, during the first nine months of 1988,'' the
report said.
   But those sharp declines probably were due to tighter sanitary
restrictions imposed on imports by the European Economic Community,
the report added.
   Imports of corn seed, up sharply last year, have traditionally
been mostly from Canada and lesser amounts from Chile. But in the
first nine months of 1988, Chile provided 45 percent of the imported
corn seed, up from only 2 percent in the same period of 1987.
Increases also were reported from Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia.

   Hot lights rather than boiling water may
have killed a 1\-pound lobster that gained attention when the woman
who bought it for a Valentine's Day feast decided to spare it from
the pot.
   Suzanne Brown said the $14 Maine lobster she dubbed Oscar died
this weekend.
   Gary Gerontis, a seafood merchant who had offered to fly the
lobster back to New England so that it could be tossed back into the
ocean, told Mrs. Brown on Friday that Oscar was terminally ill.
   She said she gave him permission to put the lobster to sleep by
placing it in the freezer.
   Mrs. Brown, tearful over the whole incident, said she feared the
media attention she stirred up to save Oscar might have caused its
demise.
   She said she told her story to the news media in hopes of finding
a tank for Oscar. The story of the woman who fell for the lobster
became an instant hit, and Oscar spent ensuing days under hot
television lights, a pen shoved in one claw to sign autographs.
   ``Everybody thought it was a wonderful story and it did make a
lot of people happy,'' she said.
   Mrs. Brown said she planned to bury the crustacean at Point
Penrose State Park.
   Her husband, Dave, planned to help bury the lobster that was
intended for his dinner plate. While he supported her efforts, he
offered a final observation: ``I never did get my dinner.''

<HEAD>Democrats Trying to Avoid Being Outmaneuvered By Bush on Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats are split over their
budget strategy, two weeks after President Bush put them on the spot
with a $1.16 trillion spending proposal that leaves many of the
difficult questions unanswered.
   Some leading Democrats lean toward cooperation with the
administration _ perhaps culminating in full-fledged, high-level
negotiations _ as the best way to forge a spending plan and to cut
the deficit to $100 billion, as required under the Gramm-Rudman
balanced budget law.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., and
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, are among those
advocating a cooperative approach.
   ``My sense is that as long as the administration wants to discuss
issues and look at options together, we're prepared to do that,''
Panetta said in an interview.
   Others, including House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, are less
disposed to collaborate beyond the consultations already under way
among White House and congressional budget writers, at least for now.
   Some of these lawmakers argue that Democrats can gain politically
by continuing to attack Bush's budget, and say there is no hurry to
work out a bargain on the spending plan just yet.
   ``It's the administration that feels an urgency to get things
going,'' says Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.
   Others, including many liberals, are even more militant, arguing
that domestic programs would fare better if the
Democratic-controlled Congress wrote its own budget. An agreement
with the administration risks having Democrats share blame with Bush
for harsh cuts in popular programs, these legislators say.
   ``The Bush budget has the rhetoric of a kinder, gentler America,
but it has the fiscal numbers of an austere, harsh America,'' says
Rep. William H. Gray III, a member of the House Democratic
leadership and the former chairman of the House budget panel. ``The
Democrats have to come up with their own budget.''
   When Bush presented his spending proposal to the
Democratic-controlled Congress on Feb. 9, he simultaneously asked
the lawmakers to negotiate with him over its final shape.
   Congressional Democrats complain that the president's blueprint
is woefully lacking in details, especially on the cuts that would be
needed to meet overall spending limits envisioned in the plan. They
say that before they agree to work out a budget jointly with Bush,
they need specific figures indicating exactly how much the
administration proposes spending on the hundreds of separate
programs covered by the budget.
   Some observers, however, believe Bush has won the first round of
the public relations war.
   ``Do you really think Joe Sixpack thinks it's unreasonable for
the president to say he wants to sit down with Congress and work it
out?'' asked Carol Cox, president of the bipartisan Committee for a
Responsible Federal Budget, which monitors budget activity.
   ``At the moment, we're boxed in,'' says Rep. Richard Durbin,
D-Ill., a budget committee member. ``The American people are looking
at Congress to make a move.''
   Says Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking GOP member on the
House budget panel, ``It's been a pleasure to watch them writhe this
week.''
   Some Democrats say accusing Bush of producing a budget that
leaves about $10 billion worth of cuts for later bargaining _ and
that makes only tiny increases in priority domestic areas _ will
eventually pay off with the public.
   Gray and some other liberals say that rather than enacting Bush's
plan, they prefer writing a Democratic budget that gets half of its
savings from domestic spending and half from defense.
   That is the same formula under which the Gramm-Rudman law
automatically slashes spending if the deficit target is missed, and
they argue that domestic spending would fare better this way.
   Some Democrats fear that even if they negotiate a budget
settlement with Bush, Republicans will campaign against them in the
next elections by blaming them for the cuts anyway.
   If there are negotiations between the administration and
Congress, a two-year budget _ rather than the usual one-year plan _
could well emerge. This would get messy decisions for fiscal 1991
out of the way before next year's campaigns, and free lawmakers to
concentrate on policy issues instead of spending woes.

<HEAD>Conservation Groups Urge Bush Administration to Buy Park Land</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservation groups want President Bush to
reverse the record of his predecessor and revive a program to
protect land around national preserves.
   ``You can defer buying a car, but a desirable piece of land is
likely to turn into a shopping mall or become too expensive. Special
areas bought today will pay enormous dividends for future
generations,'' says George T. Frampton, president of the Wilderness
Society.
   A coalition led by the Wilderness Society urged the Bush
administration Sunday to spend $781 million next year to buy land
that might otherwise be lost to developers in and around national
preserves in 46 states.
   ``You can't keep putting off these investments,'' Frampton said.
   The money would come from the Land and Water Conservation Fund,
created by Congress in 1965 to protect natural resources.
   Congress may appropriate $900 million a year from the fund, which
gets 80 percent of its money from oil-drilling on the federally
owned outer continental shelf. But purchases of land under the fund
fell sharply under President Reagan, from $509 million in 1980 to
$206 million this year.
   Bush has recommended keeping investments at $206 million for the
fiscal year beginning next October.
   As an example of land lost to development because of delays,
Frampton cited a 700-acre tract in Devil's Canyon in Colorado, which
conservationists urged the government to buy for three years. The
land has since been subdivided.
   Most of the recommended tracts lie within national parks or
forests and would not expand the boundaries of federal lands, the
statement said.
   The recommended purchases include land at Chincoteague National
Wildlife Refuge in Virginia, Olympic National Park in Washington and
Acadia National Park in Maine, the Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area in California, and along the Appalachian Trail,
which runs from Georgia to Maine.
   The only states in which purchases were not recommended were
Delaware, Kansas, Connecticut and Iowa.
   In addition to spending $781 million from the Land and Water
Conservation Fund, the coalition urged appropriation of $200 million
in matching funds for recreation projects by state and local
governments.
   Among the sites at which the report recommended purchases were:
   _Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, $30 million for
a total of 5,000 acres in Zuma, Trancas and Corral Canyons and
elsewhere.
   _Appalachian Trail, $23 million to buy land along the 2,100-mile
corridor, which is administered by the National Forest Service.
   _Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie Forest, Wash., $10 million to buy 620 acres
near Noisy Creek. Some of that land contains trees up to 10 feet in
diameter.
   _Alpine Lakes Management Area, Wash., $9.6 million to buy 7,750
acres in the Teanaway, Tumwater, Icicle Creek, Skykomish Valley and
Annette Lake areas.
   _Columbia River Gorge Scenic Area, $9.3 million to buy almost
5,200 acres on both sides of the Columbia River.
   _Olympic National Park, $4 million for 350 acres in the Lake
Crescent, Lake Quinault and coastal sections of the park.
   _Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge, on the eastern shore of
the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, $3.5 million to buy 4,350 acres,
including the barrier islands Morris, Cedar, Metomkin and Assawoman.
   _Acadia National Park, $2 million to buy 500 acres in a boundary
expansion area. Acadia is the nation's second most visited national
park, after Great Smoky Mountains park in North Carolina.
   _Goose Prairie, Wash., $700,000 to buy 25 acres, including the
summer cabin of the late Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas.
   In addition to the Wilderness Society, the coalition includes the
Izaak Walton League, the National Wildlife Federation, Friends of
the Earth, the American Hiking Association, the Sierra Club, the
National Audubon Society and the Natural Resources Defense Council.

<HEAD>Tornado Deaths Below Average in '88</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of nature's most vicious spectacles, the
tornado, is poised to renew its annual assault on America, as
changeable spring weather breeds the storms that spawn twisters.
   Last year was one of fewer than normal tornado deaths, but even
so, more than 700 of the violent funnel clouds struck the nation.
   In 1988 the nation recorded 32 tornado deaths, down from the 59
killed a year earlier and well below the long-term average of 99
fatalities annually, the National Weather Service reported on Sunday.
   But while that's good news, it isn't an indication that the
danger has lessened.
   ``There is no way of knowing what this tornado season will bring,
but the way to survive is through preparedness,'' said Ed Ferguson,
deputy director of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center in
Kansas City.
   Meteorologists have attributed the decline in tornado deaths in
recent years to increased public awareness of the storms, which are
most common in May and June but can occur in any month of the year.
   Unusually warm and wet weather last November helped trigger a
record number of tornadoes for that month, at 121 across the
country. The average for November is only 23 tornadoes, and the
record had been 81, set in 1973.
   Last year also recorded the largest tornado outbreak in 14 years.
That took place on Mother's Day when 57 twisters tore through parts
of Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin. That outbreak didn't
cause any deaths, although 10 injuries were reported.
   Arkansas and Tennessee recorded the most fatalities last year
with six deaths apiece, followed by Florida with five. Four people
were killed in North Carolina and two each in Mississippi and
Nebraska. States with a single fatality apiece were Kentucky,
Michigan, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas.
   The transition from winter to spring, spurring unsettled weather
and frequent thunderstorms, helps create tornadoes, violently
twisting winds that reach down from thunderclouds.
   After a low point in the winter they begin to increase sharply in
March and peak in May with a national average of 166 twisters in
that month, according to records kept at the National Climatic Data
Center.
   June ranks second, averaging 150 tornadoes, followed by April
with 109 in a typical year. Other months averaging more than a
twister-a-day somewhere in the nation are July, 82; August, 57;
March, 50 and September, 38.
   Hot weather stirring the air helps form thunderstorms and their
tornadoes, with 60 percent of all twisters occurring between noon
and sunset, according to the National Center for Atmospheric
Research. Tornadoes are least likely during the early morning just
before sunrise.
   The typical tornado is only about 50 yards wide and travels about
two miles on the ground _ 87 percent of the time heading toward the
northeast, NCAR researchers report.
   But while an individual twister can cover only a small area, they
often come in groups and in the affected area destruction can be
total.
   The familiar funnel cloud is the most common sign of a tornado
although adjacent winds can also cause severe damage.
   When twisters are in an area, common sense and knowing a few
simple rules can save lives, the National Weather Service says.
   If tornadoes threaten, turn on radio or television to keep
current on the danger, the agency says. The weather service even has
its own radio network which can provide continual updates. If a
twister is reported, safety rules include:
   _At home, seek shelter immediately in a basement or interior
hallway. Stay away from windows and outside walls.
   _At school, move to hallways and lie flat on the floor with head
covered.
   _In a mobile home or trailer, leave immediately. Head for a
secure shelter or lie flat on the ground. Be wary of areas with poor
drainage, however, because of the possibility of flooding from the
thunderstorm.
   _At work or in public buildings, head for interior hallways on
the lowest floor, or designated shelter areas.
   _In an automobile, leave immediately. Do not try to outrun a
tornado.

   In Dallas, six men were face down on the floor of an abandoned,
smoke-filled apartment as a handful of officers stood over them with
guns drawn.
   Fragments of a copper mesh pad were found during a search, but
the suspect denied knowing the pads often are used to strain crack.
   ``Some drug addict put that there,'' the man told police.
   ``This is a day-in, day-out battle,'' said Lt. Don Richie, who
heads the evening crew at Dallas Police Department's central

   If a crack addict has a $20,000 a year habit, he must steal about
$200,000 worth of goods to support it, according to Capt. E.R. Walt
of the Narcotics Division.
   ``Most crack addicts don't work and couldn't afford it if they
did,'' Walt said. ``So there's a lot of stuff stolen.''

as police seized $1,500 in cash and $4,700 in drugs.
   Police saw him selling drugs the day before but couldn't find his

   In Seattle, sheets of rain fell most of the day and city's two
bicycle-mounted drug teams were off duty Wednesday. Only seven
incidents involved the arrest of people in possession of drugs.
   Normally, an eight-hour shift in the city's downtown precinct
will yield five to eight drug arrests. A targeted operation, usually
held two or three times a week, might net 10 to 25 people at a time.

   The young businesswoman looked tense
and worried when the morning papers brought the news of the
cordoba's fifth devaluation this year.
   The government's latest devaluation of the national currency
meant only one thing: higher prices for food and transport; higher
costs for doing business; yet another round of belt-tightening.
   ``If we ate meat three times a week, now we'll eat it once a week
and so on until we become vegetarians,'' the woman said, toying with
a pencil at her desk. ``But even vegetables are expensive _ when you
can find them.''
   The woman and her husband are urban professionals in their early
30s with a small business. They are expecting their third child.
   In private conversations, the two spoke of the hardships the
middle class is enduring as a result of Nicaragua's economic crisis
and the thought that crosses so many people's minds: pack up and
leave for the United States, where many have relatives and friends.
   The devaluation of the cordoba is part of the government's
efforts to halt hyperinflation.
   ``You keep cutting back and cutting back (on the household
budget), but now I'm wondering what else I can eliminate,'' the
woman added.
   ``And if that's us and people like us,'' she said, leaning
forward to emphasize her point, ``can you imagine what poor people
are going through?''
   Poor and middle-class people are leaving the country in droves,
undeterred even by a get-tough U.S. immigration policy that took
effect last Tuesday.
   Despite a tripling of the price for a new passport, Nicaraguans
still flock to immigration offices.
   A senior Western diplomat said figures compiled from various
sources indicate that from 1979 _ when the leftist Sandinistas came
to power _ through 1987, Nicaragua lost about 8,500 professionals.
   The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about
2,000 professional and business people left the country in 1988
alone _ despite the signing of a preliminary peace accord in March
after seven years of war with the Contra rebels. Nicaragua's
population is about 3 million.
   ``That's people in education, business, engineering, medicine,''
the diplomat said. ``We're not talking about ideology; these are
people seeking better horizons.''
   With Thursday's latest currency devaluation, the official rate of
exchange became 3,800 cordobas per dollar, up from 3,200.
   At the new rate, a typical monthly salary of 200,000 cordobas is
worth $52. Many professionals earn up to 500,000 cordobas a month,
which translates to only $131. A new passport costs 150,000 cordobas.
   With the lastest devaluation, the price of a gallon of gasoline
rose to $2.07, up from $1.76 a gallon. Higher fuel costs mean higher
prices for food, which is trucked into the city from the countryside.
   ``She's been pressuring me for us to get out of here and go to
Miami,'' the woman's husband confided when his wife was out of
earshot. ``But I can't abandon my business now and lose all I've put
into it.''
   He said that even if he wanted to sell, he'd be hard pressed to
find a buyer.
   To control runaway inflation that reached 20,000 in 1988 and 97
percent in January alone, the government is firing more than 30,000
workers, slashing public spending, and tightly restricting credit.
   President Daniel Ortega has summed up his government's attitude
toward the exodus by saying that whoever doesn't like it here can
``leave for Miami to look for democracy and ways to enrich
themselves.''
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has summed up its
new policy, aimed at Central Americans who usually come in illegally
through Texas, by saying that anyone who can't prove political
persecution will be denied asylum and immediately jailed and
deported.
   That policy led to only a small decrease last week in the number
of people wanting to leave, said Sergio Domingo Prado, who owns a
travel agency specializing in trips to Guatemala, Mexico and the
United States.
   He said he used to organize trips to Guatemala buy bus but
stopped because every increase in fuel costs increased the price of
his bus tickets.
   ``People didn't understand. Now I just deal in plane tickets.
They're more stable,'' he said.
   His customers often make their way from Mexico and Guatemala into
the United States.
   On a recent evening, people began assembling on a sidewalk in a
lower-class neighborhood of Managua to wait for a bus to Guatemala.
   Sitting on the curb in front of a travel agency were small knots
of travelers and their relatives. Some were silent; others cried.
   Lourdes Maria Rayo Vargas, 23, was leaving with her 15-year-old
sister and their mother. They were the last in the family to leave.
Their father and three brothers had left for Guatemala four months
ago.
   ``I was the only one in the family working,'' said Ms. Rayo. ``I
worked in a supermarket, then I sold shoes. Now I've been out of
work for seven months.''
   She said she gave up trying to find a job.

   Oscar-winning actor Timothy Hutton, who sued
MGM for allegedly deceiving him in 1983 about the demise of the
motion picture ``Roadshow,'' has been awarded $9.75 million in
damages from the studio.
   A jury found Friday that the studio committed fraud and breach of
contract.
   Hutton, who won an Academy Award for his role in the film
``Ordinary People,'' said studio executives told him the picture,
about a modern-day cattle drive, was being called off because
director Richard Brooks had suffered a heart attack. Actually, MGM
lost interest in the movie after a change of management, the actor
said.
   The monthlong trial included testimony from other ``Roadshow''
actors, including Jack Nicholson. Nicholson resolved matters with
MGM several years ago, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
   MGM is now owned by Turner Broadcasting.
   ``Turner is very surprised and disappointed in the verdict and
will seek a further review,'' a company attorney said.

<TEXT>
   After three frustrating years, Swedes
hope the mystery behind the assassination of Prime Minister Olof
Palme is finally solved and that his accused killer will soon be
tried.
   Prosecutors are reported to be worried, however, that their case
may not hold up against the man arrested 10 weeks ago on suspicion
of gunning down Palme on a Stockholm street on Feb. 28, 1986.
   They acknowledge that crucial pieces of evidence are missing. If
they have found a motive, they aren't saying. Legal experts say the
case will rest on whether a chain of circumstantial evidence can be
established.
   ``The prosecution is in bad shape if they don't find the murder
weapon or present other very strong forensic evidence,'' said Lena
Holmqvist, a lecturer in criminal law at Uppsala University.
   Since the shooting, police have dedicated nearly one million
man-hours and hundreds of millions of dollars chasing international
conspiracy theories centering on Iran or on Kurdish terrorists.
   In the end, the suspect they arrested was a Swede, a loner with a
previous manslaughter conviction and a history of drug addiction,
alcohol abuse and psychiatric treatment.
   The arrest Dec. 14 of Christer Pettersson, 41, came as such an
anticlimax that one legal commentator wrote in the Dagens Nyheter
daily that ``the borderline between reality and fiction is being
erased.''
   Pettersson's lawyer says his client has denied any connection
with the slaying, which occurred as Palme was walking home from a
movie with his wife Lisbet, who was grazed by a second bullet and
survived.
   Prosecutors have released virtually no information about their
case, and Pettersson's name cannot even be published here under
Swedish press regulations.
   But they have made enough headway to persuade a judge five times
to extend the two-week detention order against him.
   ``There has been progress ... but we cannot make any estimate of
how long the investigation will go on,'' chief prosecutor Jorgen
Almblad said two weeks ago.
   Published reports say the prosecution's case was built on
witnesses who placed the suspect at the scene. Mrs. Palme has
identified Pettersson as the gunman, but without absolute certainty,
the reports say.
   If the case against Pettersson falls apart, the testimony of the
few eyewitnesses would be useless against anyone else, virtually
destroying any chance of sending Palme's killer to prison.
   Pettersson, who was questioned briefly and released shortly after
the murder, came under suspicion again after police received a tip
that his alibi was phony.
   He has a long criminal record, which includes the fatal bayonet
stabbing of a man in a street brawl in 1970.
   ``I think most people were pleased that we finally have found
someone and are relieved that it's a Swede,'' said Ms. Holmqvist.
``If it's an ordinary maniac, we can leave the whole story behind
us.''
   Under Swedish law, the case would be heard by the Stockholm
district court before a panel of one judge and five laymen, each of
whom have equal say on whether to convict. A 4-2 vote is enough for
conviction, but a tie means acquittal.
   The slaying of Palme, a four-term prime minister who championed
international disarmament, jolted Swedes from the idea that they
were safe from the viciousness and terrorism that afflict other
countries.
   But the national trauma is fading. Last year, people stopped
putting fresh flowers on the improvised sidewalk monument where
Palme fell.
   Palme's governing Social Democratic party said it planned no
ceremony to mark the anniversary this year.
   The three-year manhunt exposed some weaknesses in the Swedish
criminal system. Many Swedes were astonished that a man with
Pettersson's violent past was free on the street.
   Several parliamentary committees criticized the police for
bungling the investigation. For years, police and prosecutors
squabbled over who was in charge of the case since the law is not
specific.
   Frustration over the failure to make an arrest also encouraged
overzealous authorities to approve a private investigation that
overstepped legal limits.
   The resulting scandal forced the resignation of Justice Minister
Anna-Greta Leijon in June, and a parliamentiary commitee is now
trying to find out how much unauthorized eavesdropping and other
illegal activity was going on.

   A surge in violence has raised fears
of a leftist revolt and renewed repression by rightist death squads
in Honduras, which is squeezed between a civil war in El Salvador
and a dying insurgency in Nicaragua.
   Since Jan. 7, bombings have injured 10 people, three U.S.
soldiers have been wounded in attacks on American troops, and three
people have been assassinated.
   Honduran officials, however, are quick to point out that the
level of violence remains low by Central American standards.
   ``We are not in the middle of a communal war,'' said President
Jose Azcona Hoyo in an interview with The Associated Press. ``Health
and education are more serious problems than violence.''
   But four bombings since Feb. 18 prompted the chief of the armed
forces, Gen. Humberto Regalado, to announce Thursday increased
internal security and vigilance at public buildings.
   Americans are ``briefed to keep a reasonable profile and be
cautious in their daily lives,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles
Barclay. He said the instructions had not changed since shots were
fired at a military convoy on Feb. 1 and a bomb was tossed at a bus
Feb. 18.
   About 1,200 U.S. troops are stationed at Palmerola's Enrique
Sotocano Air Base, and National Guard troops take part in frequent
exercises. Honduras received about $1.15 billion in U.S. civil and
military aid from 1981 to 1988.
   Set like a keystone between Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala,
Honduras has frequently been involved in border problems and
regional disputes, most recently by helping U.S.-supported Contra
rebels trying to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government of
Nicaragua.
   ``Honduras has been the big loser in Central America,'' said
Efrain Diaz Arrivillaga, presidential candidate of the small
Christian Democratic party in elections set for Nov. 26.
   Some of the violence can be pinned on leftist groups like the
Cinchonero guerrillas, but internal political disputes, drug
trafficking and Machiavellian revenge theories also circulate,
creating an atmosphere of uncertainty.
   No group has claimed responsibility for the most recent bombings.
   Carlos Montoya, president of the Honduran Congress, said they
``are related to conflicts of an internal order.''
   He claimed the bombings are linked to drug trafficking and a
recent police takeover at the Central Penitentiary, where guards
were accused of taking payoffs. He refused to elaborate.
   The most significant killing, that of Gen. Gustavo Alvarez
Martinez on Jan. 25, was thoroughly professional. He was blasted by
six gunmen who knew his routine, and the Cinchoneros promptly
claimed responsibility.
   Alvarez, head of the military from 1982 to 1984, played godfather
to the Contras. He was dumped by fellow officers and made an
apparently genuine conversion to evangelical Christianity, carrying
a Bible and refusing armed guards.
   ``He was an extremist. Maybe he went to another extreme,'' said
Diaz.
   Many Hondurans fear right-wing repression more than a revived
guerrilla force. In 1980-1984, when the Cinchonero Popular
Liberation Movement was most active, more than 130 death squad
killings and disappearances were reported.
   That is far fewer than the tens of thousands who have died in El
Salvador and Guatemala. But the specter of death squads caused an
almost panicked reaction when the Alliance for Anticommunist Action
_ Triple A _ distributed leaflets in late January threatening human
rights and labor and political leaders.
   ``We hope that the response (to violence) is not repression,''
said Felix Molina, an official of the Center for Human Rights.
Molina claims Triple A is made up of army troops, but the military
denies involvement.
   ``There's no evidence the Triple A exists. They haven't actually
done anything. The leaflets could be produced by anyone,'' said
Ruben Zepeda, the nation's attorney general.
   Honduras was once the prototypical banana republic, with bananas
its leading export and revolving door governments _ it suffered 17
coups or coup attempts in four years.
   The nation of about 5 million is the poorest in Central America.
Illiteracy is estimated at 46 percent, unemployment 25 percent,
inflation 30 percent.
   Border problems are historic.
   When the Sandinistas were trying to topple Nicaraguan dictator
Anastasio Somoza, overthrown in 1979, many of their leaders lived in
Honduras. In turn, the United States used Honduras to arm and train
the Contras against the triumphant Sandinistas.
   The Contras, operating from bases on the eastern border, provided
a buffer with Nicaragua. But now that U.S. military aid to the
rebels has ended, Honduras finds itself playing host to an
unemployed army of 11,000 and providing homes for an estimated
140,000 refugees from the guerilla wars.
   There also is trouble on the western border, where the leftist
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front is fighting the Salvadoran
government. Angry Honduran officials say Salvadoran refugee camps
are simply guerrilla training bases.
   Street life in Tegucigalpa appears unaffected by the scattered
violence. Young men and women stroll the city center into the
evening.
   There are classic signs of rural immigration and underemployment.
Pregnant women sell food on the streets, young men sell trinkets,
and beggars ask car owners to let them spend the night in their
automobiles.
   Murders increased 15 percent, to 177 last year, and Zepeda said
automatic rifles, sold by penniless Contras for $300 to $400, are
showing up in the hands of ordinary criminals.
   ``The people are scared, and with good reason,'' said the daily
El Tiempo in an editorial. ``The assassinations are an unequivocal
sign that we are in the shadow of what could quickly develop into
major bloodshed, as happened in Guatemala and El Salvador.''

   The winner of the $16 million Lotto America
prize says the money should be enough to allow him to retire from
the military _ ``if they let me.''
   Lee Nelson, an Army sergeant stationed at the Pentagon, claimed
the jackpot Sunday after sitting quietly for a week with the winning
ticket.
   Nelson, 29, of Alexandria, Va., will get $640,000 annually after
taxes from the Des Moines-based lottery, which announced the winning
combination of numbers Feb. 18. Nelson bought his ticket at a
convenience food store in southeast Washington, D.C.
   A native of South Carolina, the married father of two children
works as an accountant for the Pentagon. He said he picked the
winning numbers _ nine, 17, 20, 28, 46 and 50 _ at random.
   Nelson's routine hardly changed in the days after he and his
wife, Mary, finally convinced themselves that the numbers they had
chosen were indeed the winning combination.
   ``I got up, went to work, spent my lunch hour at the gym, came
home and had dinner. I put in a leave request on Tuesday so that I
could have Friday off,'' he said.
   Asked whether he would leave his job, Nelson said, ``if they let
me. I don't know now.'' His Army enlistment is up on June 5.
   The new multimillionaire was uncomfortable in the spotlight,
telling reporters at a news conference, ``We don't want no
publicity.'' He said his greatest fear was ``the public.''
   Lotto America also will award $25,000 to the man who sold Nelson
the winning ticket, Mohammed Emamhoussein, an employee of the South
Capitol Mini Mart in southeast Washington.
   In addition to the District of Columbia, the states taking part
in Lotto America are Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Oregon, Rhode Island
and West Virginia.
   In a drawing Saturday night at Lotto America headquarters in Des
Moines, Iowa, officials announced another large jackpot of $2
million. The winning ticket was sold at a National Supermarkets
store in St. Louis, but the identity of the winner was not known
late Sunday.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government seems
to have hit a rough patch as its capitalist crusade begins to bite
into the heart of British society.
   With the socialist and centrist opposition divided, the
Conservatives continue to look unassailable.
   But some analysts say the government's prestige is threatened by
rising inflation and interest rates, coupled with contentious
reforms of fundamental institutions including the health service,
education and the legal profession.
   They see a warning light in the result of Thursday's by-election
to fill the vacant parliamentary seat of Richmond, in northern
England.
   The Tories won, but their thumping 19,576-vote majority in the
June 1987 general election was slashed to 2,634 against a stunning
resurgence of the centrist Democrats and Social Democrats.
   It was the biggest anti-Tory swing in any constituency since Mrs.
Thatcher came to office in May 1979.
   United, the centrists could have taken the seat easily. But they
are deeply divided.
   Labor, the main opposition party, limped in with fewer than 3,000
votes, a predictable result in a wealthy rural constituency like
Richmond.
   But in another by-election Thursday, in Wales, Labor saw its
majority slip by about 6,500 votes against a much strengthened
showing by Plaid Cymru, the separatist Welsh nationalist party.
   Tory analysts say the Richmond result is not surprising for a
government nearing midterm, when by-elections often become
instruments for registering protest votes.
   The conservative Daily Telegraph dismissed the result as ``a mild
bout of midterm unpopularity.''
   But the liberal Observer, while agreeing that midterm setbacks do
not diminish the government's underlying strength, also looked at
the opinion polls and said: ``Perhaps the tide is turning at last.''
   A Gallup poll in The Sunday Telegraph put Labor and the Tories at
35 percent each in terms of public preference, while a Harris poll
for the Observer put Labor one point ahead of the Tories, at 42
percent.
   The Observer said its poll of 1,027 respondents put Labor ahead
for the first time since October 1986, and was Labor's best showing
since 1983.
   The Telegraph did not say how many people were questioned and
neither paper reported a margin of error.
   In the June 1987 general election the Conservatives took 42.3
percent of the vote to Labor's 30.8 percent and won a 102-seat
parliamentary majority in the 650-seat House of Commons. The next
general election must be held by mid-1992, but will likely be held
sooner.
   ``The Conservative Party is now losing a very large number of
votes,'' said Professor Ivor Crewe, an Essex University analyst.
   ``But these votes are being dissipated across more than one
party. In other words, they're losing votes but they can still
expect to go on gaining seats on a minority vote just as they did in
Richmond,'' he told British Broadcasting Corp. television.
   In seeking to revamp the health service, legal professions and
schools and inject them with a measure of private competition, the
government is signaling that far from losing stamina after a decade
in office, its reforming zeal is stronger than ever.
   The Tories say they want to broaden consumer choice and break
down entrenched bureaucracies.
   But another Sunday Telegraph Gallup poll, published last week,
found a large majority of teachers, doctors and lawyers opposing the
reforms _ and a 7 percent swing in their voting intentions from the
Tories to Labor.
   The government's prestige is suffering from an annual inflation
rate above 7 percent and a prime lending rate of 14 percent.
   Also, its bold plans to sell off the water supply in England and
Wales as part of its privatization drive is proving unpopular.
Consumers fear a sharp rise in water prices if the industry is to be
profitable on the open market.
   The Richmond result, said the middle-of-the-road Independent
newspaper, ``is certainly not an indication of irreversible decline.
   ``In this case, an energetic administration is busily forcing a
great deal of highly contentious legislation through Parliament,
much of it disturbing to middle-class voters.''
   Even the usually pro-government Times of London warned that the
loss of popularity stemmed not just from midterm doldrums, but from
public suspicion of water privatization, health service
restructuring and inflation.
   ``The government faces a period of highly sensitive public
relations,'' it said, ``and must justify its policies convincingly.''

   Richard V. Secord, one of four men facing
criminal charges in the Iran-Contra affair, was arrested on
suspicion of drunken driving, police said.
   Secord, a retired Air Force major general, was arrested early
Sunday morning after officers saw his car weaving on a highway of
this Washington, D.C., suburb, according to Fairfax County Police
communications supervisor Pete Kirby.
   Secord was charged with driving while intoxicated and taken to an
adult detention center, where he appeared before a magistrate, Kirby
said.
   A court official at the magistrate's office said he did not
whether a court date had been set.
   Secord has a nonpublished telephone number and was not available
for comment.
   Secord was charged in the Iran-Contra affair in March 1988 along
with former National Security Council aide Oliver North, former
national security adviser John M. Poindexter and Secord's
ex-business partner, Albert Hakim.
   Secord, an arms dealer who helped North sell weapons to Iran and
divert the proceeds to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, was charged
with conspiracy, theft, wire fraud and conspiring to pay North
illegal gratuities.
   North is the first of the defendants to go on trial, and his
trial was scheduled to resume today in U.S. District Court in
Washington.

<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
on Sunday called for a cease-fire and peace talks with leftist
rebels, who have offered to take part in national elections set for
March if the vote is postponed.
   Duarte said on nationwide television and radio that if the talks
prove inconclusive on the postponement issue, he favors resolving it
with a referendum.
   The president proposed that the U.S.-backed government and the
rebel Farabundo Marti Liberation Front ``unilaterally cease
hostilities between Feb. 28 and June 1'' and begin peace talks
Tuesday in Guatemala.
   The rebels offered on Jan. 24 to take part in elections _ and
recognize the results _ if the vote were postponed from March 19
until September, and if their security is guaranteed and electoral
changes are made to ensure a fair vote.
   In an unprecedented meeting in Mexico last week, they told
Salvadoran political leaders that they would lay down their arms if
the election were postponed at least four months, the armed forces
sharply reduced and the police reorganized. They also proposed
direct talks with Duarte.
   There was no immediate rebel reaction to Duarte's comments Sunday.
   In his speech, Duarte suggested that the guerrillas be
incorporated into Salvadoran society and politics and that the
Salvadorn armed forces be recognized as the only army in the country.
   He did not refer directly to the guerrilla proposal, but he said
he would propose that the presidential balloting be postponed until
April 30. He did not specify when a plebiscite might take place.
   Duarte said the delegation to peace talks would include
representatives from the legislature, which is dominated by the
right-wing National Republican Alliance, and the 13 political
parties.
   He did not say whether he would participate in the talks or name
a representative.
   He also did not explain why he suddenly changed his position of
strongly opposing any delay in the elections.
   Proposing the referendum, Duarte said sovereignty rests with the
Salvadoran people and for this reason a ``solution is possible
through consulting the people.''
   He said another way to postpone elections legally would be for
the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the government
to all agree on a legal mechanism to bring about a postponement.
   He implied the presidential polling could not be postponed beyond
April 30.
   Duarte and the armed forces have been saying that a delay in the
vote would be unconstitutional and military leaders have suggested
publicly they may take over if the vote did not go on as scheduled.
   El Salvador's constitution specifies that a new president is to
take office on June 1.
   Duarte initially said he would let the political parties decide
on the matter. Last Monday and Tuesday, a delegation of Salvadoran
political leaders met in Mexico with rebel leaders.
   The meetings were cordial but ended without any agreement.
   The guerrillas contend that the politicial parties are hiding
behind the constitution to avoid substantive talks.
   More than 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have died in
9-year-old war between the government and the leftist rebels.
   The guerrillas have steadfastly rejected the five national
elections this decade as part of a U.S.-backed counterinsurgency
campaign.
   Duarte said in his speech Sunday it was necessary to initiate ``a
new search to put an end to the armed conflict that is covering our
country with blood.''
   He also said he had no personal ambitions in the matter: ``I beg
of God that he lets our people find peace.''

   President Bush, after giving human rights apparent
back-burner treatment in talks with Chinese leaders, told the vice
premier today he thought it was wrong for authorities to bar a
leading dissident from attending a dinner he hosted.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush also
directed U.S. Ambassador Winston Lord to seek a meeting with the
Chinese Foreign Ministry to learn why Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist
and prominent human rights activist, was intercepted as he tried to
go into the dinner.
   Fitzwater said Bush learned of incident today, the day after it
happened, and that he ``expressed regret'' to Vice Premier Wu
Xueqian just before boarding Air Force One for Seoul, South Korea.
   Police used the pretext of a traffic violation to stop a car
carrying the 53-year-old Fang to the banquet Sunday night, halted a
taxi that he transferred to and ordered a public bus not to pick him
up. They insisted he was not on the guest list although the official
U.S. list bore his name.
   Police then tailed him, his wife and an American couple, Perry
Link, a professor of Chinese literature and his wife, for an hour
and a half as they walked to Lord's residence to seek help.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Sheridan W. Bell said that Lord was ``in
the process'' of requesting a meeting with the Foreign Ministry to
discuss the incident, which shocked and dismayed other outspoken
Chinese intellectuals.
   He refused to disclose what message Lord would give the ministry
or to characterize the degree of seriousness with which the incident
was being treated.
   Fitzwater said that Bush felt the Chinese trip had gone well,
generally, and said the president takes the view that such problems
as human rights should be dealt with in a low-key and private manner.
   Contradicting a statement he made a day earlier, Fitzwater also
said that Bush did raise the issue of human rights problems
``privately'' in China. But the president also heard Communist Party
leader Zhao Ziyang lecture him about how dissidents were undermining
economic reform in his country.
   In a telephone interview late Sunday, Fang said the police action
was ``foolish'' and showed the government was weak and afraid of the
growing vocalism of a small but growing community of disaffected
intellectuals.
   ``'It's a normal thing to attend a banquet but the authorities
here are afraid of even that,'' Fang said.
   Fang, an internationally known astrophysicist frequently referred
to as the Andrei Sakharov of China, was one of several government
critics whom the White House invited to the banquet at a local hotel
in an apparent gesture of support.
   The others _ including leading Marxist theorist Su Shaozhi and
playwright Wu Zuguang _ attended without interference. But none is
as well-known outside China as Fang, who stepped into the political
limelight in 1986 with eloquent speeches to college students,
calling for democracy and human rights.
   Copies and tapes of Fang's speeches rapidly spread unofficially
from campus to campus, and the government blamed him for a later
nationwide wave of student demonstrations in the winter of 1986-87.
He was expelled from the ruling Communist Party and fired as vice
president of a leading scientific university.
   China's official media did not report the police action against
Fang on Monday and the Foreign Ministry and Public Security Ministry
refused to comment immediately.
   The official Xinhua News Agency issued a commentary describing
Bush's visit as ``an unusual diplomatic initiative'' because it came
so early in his presidency, and said he was given a ``warm and
friendly reception.''
   However, it added, ``As the Chinese leaders pointed out during
the meetings ... some Americans are prone to impose their
unreasonable views on matters concerning China's internal affairs.''
   Zhao told Bush in unusually blunt langage that any U.S. support
for Chinese dissidents would be ``detrimental ... to Chinese-U.S.
friendship,'' according to Xinhua.
   Fang now works at the Beijing Observatory. On a trip to Australia
last summer, he alluded to widespread unofficial reports that
Chinese leaders and their children maintain foreign bank accounts.
In apparent retaliation, the government withdrew permission for him
to travel to the United States to take part in an academic seminar
and to teach.
   Fang recently sent an open letter to senior Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping calling for amnesty for political prisoners, and the call
was taken up by several other leading writers and thinkers who sent
a follow-up letter.

<TEXT>
   Nearly a decade after the Three Mile Island
accident, half those polled believe another serious nuclear power
accident is likely, and eight in 10 people favor stricter safety
standards.
   An Associated Press-Media General survey found support for
continued use of nuclear plants now operating. But most opposed
building new plants or starting up completed plants that are not yet
in operation.
   Overall, 55 percent said they supported use of nuclear power to
generate electricity.
   But 56 percent of the 1,162 adults polled said it is impossible
to store radioactive waste from nuclear plants safely. And while
most said the plants are safer now than a decade ago, 50 percent
called an accident likely.
   The national poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
   The survey was conducted Jan. 4-12 in anticipation of the 10th
anniversary of the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident. The
Three Mile Island accident, which began March 28, 1979, destroyed a
reactor at the Middletown, Pa., plant.
   Considerably tighter federal regulation of the commercial nuclear
power industry followed the accident, and a solid 63 percent in the
poll said they believed U.S. nuclear plants are safer than they were
10 years ago.
   Nonetheless, an overwhelming 79 percent said the federal
government should be even tougher when it comes to enforcing nuclear
safety rules. And 62 percent said governors should be empowered to
shut down nuclear plants in their states.
   Backing for nuclear power was markedly higher among men and
Republicans. Two-thirds of those groups supported nuclear power
generally, compared with half the Democrats and independents and
just 45 percent of the women polled.
   When asked to rate the chance of a serious accident at a U.S.
nuclear plant, 11 percent overall chose ``highly likely'' and 39
percent said an accident was likely, for a total of 50 percent.
Thirty percent said ``unlikely'' and 14 percent said ``highly
unlikely,'' for a total of 44 percent. The rest had no opinion.
   Six in 10 women and as many Democrats called an accident likely,
compared with four in 10 of the men and the Republicans. Among
respondents with postgraduate schooling, just 37 percent called an
accident likely; that swelled to 58 percent of those who has not
gone beyond high school.
   Overall, only a third said more nuclear plants should be built in
the United States. Of those who favored more plants, three-quarters
said they would accept one within 10 miles of their home. The
government has not issued any new permits to build nuclear power
plants since 1979.
   Just two in 10 said nuclear plants that have been completed but
not yet licensed should be allowed to open. Such plants in Seabrook,
N.H., and Shoreham, N.Y., have been stalled in part by opposition
from Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and, in Seabrook's case, Gov.
Michael Dukakis of neighboring Massachusetts.
   A governor is not empowered to close a plant outright. In the
poll, however, six in 10 said a governor should have the authority
to prevent a nuclear power plant from opening in his or her state,
and as many said a governor should be empowered to shut down an
operating plant.
   Just 9 percent said the nation's 108 fully operating commercial
nuclear power plants should be closed down immediately; 48 percent
said they should continue to operate and 35 percent said they should
be phased out gradually. Eight percent had no opinion.
   Of those who wanted the plants phased out, a third wanted it done
within five years, about a third within 10 years and the rest would
allow longer.

   After rising during the morning session, share
prices fell back in afternoon trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Monday, while the dollar finished lower against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 126.00 yen, down 0.29 yen from its
126.29-yen finish on Thursday. After opening at 125.90 yen, the U.S.
currency ranged between 125.75 and 126.02 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which hit a new
high by gaining 56.70 points in the morning session, ended the day
down 166.72 points, or 0.51 percent, at 32,285.77. The index had
gained 140.56 points for a record 32,452.49-point closing on
Thursday.
   Japanese financial markets were closed Friday because of the
state funeral of Emperor Hirohito.
   Dealers said the Nikkei index fell because of profit taking.
   In currency dealings, the dollar's low opening followed its
weakness in Friday's New York trading, despite the Federal Reserve
action to raise its discount rate, dealers said.
   The Fed's rate hike dissappointed New York financial markets
because American market players had hoped it would go further than a
half-percentage-point hike, said foreign exchange traders. The move
was also seen as coming too late.
   Tokyo foreign exchange dealers were unimpressed as well. Traders
said that a rate hike had been expected, and was fully discounted.
   Higher U.S. interest rates tend to make the dollar more
attractive to foreign investors, but Friday's U.S. interest rate
hike did not lead Japanese market players to the dollar-buying, said
one dealer with a commercial bank in Tokyo.
   Meanwhile, Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama indicated
Monday that there is no need for Japan to follow the U.S. discount
rate hike with a rate hike of its own, Kyodo News Service reported.

<TEXT>
   A woman who was caught driving David
Letterman's sports car and once broke into his house has been
arrested again, this time while wandering in the comedian's foyer,
police said.
   Margaret Ray, 36, was arrested Friday night and charged with one
felony count of trespassing and one misdemeanor count each of
possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, police
said Sunday.
   She was being held on $5,000 bond, and was to be arraigned today.
   Police Capt. Michael Angelastro said he could not say how she got
inside the house. He declined additional comment.
   Ray was arrested last May as she was driving Letterman's $80,000
Porsche. She had come under suspicion because she didn't have $3 to
pay a toll.
   Police said Ray identified herself as Letterman's wife and
introduced her 3-year-old son who was in the car as David Letterman
Jr.
   Letterman refused to press charges.
   A few days later, police arrested Ray at Letterman's
three-bedroom house in New Canaan. She apparently had moved into the
house with her son and lived there for a couple of days while the
star of NBC-TV's ``Late Night With David Letterman'' was out of
town, police said.
   In September, a judge ordered her to give up contact with
Letterman except through the mail and to remain at Fairfield Hills
Hospital, where she had been undergoing psychiatric treatment.
   She also was ordered to return to her hometown of Crawford,
Colo., upon release from the hospital.

<HEAD>Duarte Agrees To Direct Negotiations With Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
has accepted leftist rebels' proposal to hold direct peace talks,
calling for them to begin Tuesday in Guatemala with a three-month
cease-fire in place.
   In a nationwide television and radio address Sunday night, Duarte
also addressed the guerrillas' offer to participate in and accept
the results of the presidential election if it is postponed for at
least four months.
   He advocated postponing the vote, which is scheduled for March
19, until April 30 and proposed that a referendum be held on the
issue if the government and rebels cannot resolve it in talks.
   Duarte did not say when such a plebiscite might take place.
   A meeting in Guatemala would be the first direct negotiations
since October 1987 between the U.S.-backed government and the
insurgents it has been fighting for nine years. The last talks ended
in stalemate.
   Duarte, 63, said he was proposing ``a new search to put an end to
the armed conflict that is covering our country with blood,''
proposing that a cease-fire begin Tuesday and run at least through
June 1.
   The civil war has killed an estimated 70,000 people, most of them
civilians.
   There was no immediate comment from the rebels on Duarte's
proposal.
   The Faribundo Marti National Liberation Front, a revolutionary
army of about 7,000 combatants, proposed last month that the
presidential vote be put off until September.
   The offer was a dramatic turnabout and the Bush administration
said it was ``worthy of serious and substantive consideration.''
   The rebels have boycotted and condemned all five previous
national elections this decade, contending they have not been free
and fair and were part of a U.S.-imposed plan to put a civilian
facade on a military-dominated government.
   The insurgents, during talks with representatives of political
parties in Mexico last week, indicated they would be willing to
accept an election as early as July. They said they needed at least
four months to shift from a military to an electoral campaign.
   The rebels also offered to lay down their arms if the country's
armed forces were significantly cut and the police force reorganized.
   Duarte, a Christian Democrat, said Sunday that the legislature
should name three representatives to take part in the Guatemala
talks. He said the 13 parties should name one person to participate.
   He did not say if he would head the government delegation, nor
how many members of the executive branch would take part.
   The legislature is controlled by the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, which is favored to win the
presidential election.
   Arena has adamantly refused to accept any postponment of the vote.
   The army, the country's most powerful institution, also has said
postponement of the election would be unconstitutional and
threatened to take power if voting is postponed.
   When the guerrillas made their original proposal Jan. 24, Duarte
said postponement of the elections beyond March 31 would be
unconstitutional. The constitution says the vote must take place at
least two months before the end of the incumbent's term, which is
June 1.
   Duarte did not provide any explanation as to why April 30 would
be any more constitutional than a later date. He reiterated that he
would step down June 1.
   The legislature is empowered to name an interim president if
there is no president-elect to take power June 1.
   The president, who suffers from terminal liver cancer, said the
Guatemala talks would intend to end the war, incorporate the rebels
into the political sphere and achieve the recognition by the
guerrillas of the government armed forces as the country's only
legitimate military organization.
   The rebels said in Mexico that they would recognize the armed
forces if it were reduced from its current strength of 56,000 to the
1980 level of 12,000.
   The insurgents also called for a restructuring and consolidation
of the three separate police forces, and trial and punishment for
officers responsible for gross violations of human rights.
   The army has staunchly protected its members from prosecution for
human rights abuses.

   A failed lock may have caused a United Airlines
jumbo jet's cargo door to pop open at 22,000 feet, ripping a huge
hole up the side of the plane and sending nine passengers to their
deaths, federal investigators say.
   Damage to the plane is consistent with the cargo door popping
open under pressurization of the cabin as the jet gained altitude
and atmospheric pressure outside the aircraft declined,
investigators said late Saturday.
   ``We are focusing on and looking at the latching mechanism,''
said Lee Dickinson, a National Transportation Safety Board
investigator.
   One cargo door latch attached to the fuselage was removed Sunday
and will be compared to latches on other Boeing 747s, he said. The
10-by-10-foot cargo door has 10 latches, eight on the bottom and two
on the sides, as well as two hook pins on each side.
   ``We're also trying to get a better handle on these latch pin
supports and comparing them to others,'' Dickinson said.
   Asked whether it would be possible to determine the cause of the
accident without the door, he said ``Obviously if we had the door it
would be very helpful to us ... but there is other information that
is helpful, '' he said.
   More than 70 investigators, including 16 from the NTSB, worked
Sunday on finding the cause of the accident. But the Coast Guard
suspended a sea and air search 100 miles south of Honolulu after
finding more debris from the plane.
   Coast Guard Lt. Brad Nelson said the search was hampered by high
seas. ``There's probably not a lot more that can be picked up,'' he
said.
   United Flight 811, carrying 354 people, had taken off Friday for
New Zealand and was about 100 miles from Honolulu when the fuselage
ripped open over the Pacific Ocean. Nine passengers were sucked out
and are presumed dead.
   The pilot lost power in one of the four engines and shut down
another when a fire indicator light went on, but the plane returned
safely to Honolulu.
   United announced Sunday that it had begun a series of special
maintenance checks on its aircraft. United Chairman Stephen M. Wolf
said the maintenance checks are ``over and above (United's) existing
procedures and those required by the Federal Aviation
Administration.''
   He also said an FAA-licensed mechanic will inspect each 747 cargo
door after a landing and will oversee the closing of each 747 cargo
door before departures. The closings have been handled by ramp
personnel, his statement said.
   Two cutters returned to port Sunday morning with items recovered
by then, including part of an overhead compartment, a section of
fuselage and two seats.
   Also found were safety instruction cards and personal items
including shoes and a teddy bear, said Lt. Cmdr. Paul Ellner, a
Coast Guard spokesman.
   No bodies have been found, officials said.
   Michael Marx, the NTSB's senior metallurgist, said there was no
evidence that metal fatigue _ weakness caused gradually by long-term
use _ caused the hole in the 18-year-old jet, United's oldest Boeing
747.
   Marx said the hole's edge indicated that ``overstress'' _ a
stress greater than the plane could stand _ had been placed on the
aircraft, but he did not say what it might have been.
   ``If a door opened in flight, it could possibly cause
overstress,'' Dickinson said in response to a question. Dickinson
added that the condition could be caused by other factors he
declined to explain.
   ``It's typical of an overload,'' Marx said.
   The hole follows the dimensions of the cargo door and flares
farther up the aircraft, Dickinson said.
   The Federal Aviation Adminstration in July ordered airlines to
improve cargo door lock systems on older Boeing 747s after a door in
one plane partly opened in flight. The deadline for the work was the
end of 1989.
   United had inspected all 25 of its jets covered by the order but
had completed the required modifications on just six by last week,
spokesman Russell Mack said in Chicago. The plane in last week's
accident was not one of the six, he said.
   Dickinson said the pilot and co-pilot told investigators Saturday
there was no indication of trouble closing the cargo doors.
Dickinson said a warning light in the cockpit would have indicated
if the doors were not closed properly.
   The cargo door warning system worked when tested Sunday, but
Dickinson said he did not know whether the pilot noticed the warning
light when the cargo door ripped off.
   FBI agents searched the cargo area with dogs and found no
evidence of explosives, Dickinson said. FBI explosive experts were
sent home, he said Sunday.
   ``Nothing yet gives us any indication of a bomb in the cargo
area, but we are not drawing any conclusions yet,'' he said.
   The missing passengers are: Susan Craig and Harry Craig of
Morristown, N.J.; Rose Harley of Hackensack, N.J.; Anthony Fallon
and Barbara Fallon of Long Beach, Calif.; Mary T. Handley of Bay
City, Mich.; Lee Campbell of Wellington, New Zealand, and Dr. John
Michael Crawford and John Swann, both of Sydney, Australia.
   Honolulu hospitals reported treating 27 people, mostly for minor
injuries caused by flying debris.
   Three people remained hospitalized Sunday _ a 48-year-old flight
attendant in fair condition with broken bones in her neck and upper
back and abdominal injuries; a flight attendant in fair condition
with a fractured arm; and a 73-year-old New Zealand man in stable
condition with heart problems.

<HEAD>Dismissal Recommended For Marine Captain Who Associated With Lesbians</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note contents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 12-year Marine Corps veteran should
be dismissed because her association with lesbians made the corps
look bad, a board of inquiry has ruled.
   Capt. Judy Meade's friendships with lesbian women gave the
impression ``that you yourself were a lesbian, (and) therefore
brings discredit to yourself and the Marine Corps,'' Col. J.J.
Carroll told Meade on Sunday.
   Ms. Meade, 36, testified last week that she is not a lesbian.
   The five-member board recommended that Ms. Meade be dismissed
with an ``other than honorable'' discharge, which would mean the
loss of normal discharge and retirement benefits.
   Ms. Meade declined to comment, but her civilian attorney, Vaughn
Taylor, called the hearing process unfair.
   A board of inquiry hearing differs from a court martial, which is
similar to a civilian trial, in that five Marine colonels hear the
presentation of the government against the accused and then make a
decision. The board has a legal adviser available.
   The opinion is automatically reviewed by the commanding general,
and then the Board of Review in Washington.
   ``We wish they had court-martialed Judy Meade,'' Taylor said.
``... The evidence the government presented would have never been
admitted in court. It would have not been been allowed under the
rules of evidence.''
   Most of the allegations against Meade stemmed from a February
1988 visit she made to the home of a Beaufort, S.C., woman.
   Government witnesses said they had seen Meade and the woman in
bed together.
   Both Meade and the woman testified they had never had sexual
contact.
   Prosecutor Capt. Christopher E. Dougherty argued the incident was
enough to constitute conduct unbecoming an officer because some
enlisted women also visiting the house saw the women in bed together.
   ``The board's responsibility is not to make a moral judgment on
Capt. Judy Meade's life,'' he said. ``It's to ask you to uphold the
standards of the U.S. Marine Corps. The Marine Corps is a way of
life. She hasn't adopted it.''
   The board said Ms. Meade had failed to report suspected lesbian
activity, and had misled her superior officers by withholding
information that the other woman was a lesbian.
   Eighteen women at Parris Island, S.C., the only Marine boot camp
where women go for basic training, have been discharged for
homosexual behavior and court-martialed under charges of sodomy and
indecent acts.

   In a boxy little house on a trim suburban
street, police believe mild-mannered engineer Richard Daniel
Starrett, perhaps under the influence of porn-fueled fantasies,
assaulted young women while his wife was away.
   He has admitted, police say, to kidnapping and assaulting three
girls, killing one of them, and assaulting four others in Georgia
and South Carolina.
   Police in five other states want to talk to him.
   When police earlier this month searched Starrett's rented storage
unit, a mile from his house, they found 935 pornographic books and
magazines depicting sexual bondage, horror scenes and nudity. They
also found criminology textbooks and books about serial killer Ted
Bundy, who preyed on attractive young women.
   And police said they found about 100 videotapes, some of which
were of Starrett's sexual assaults.
   ``He was, to his neighbors, a quiet, reserved, working
businessman, a family man,'' says Columbia County Sheriff Otis
Hensley. ``And there were no suspicions by any (fellow) employees,
or not even suspicion by his family.''
   Starrett, 29, a design engineer, came to authorities' attention
Feb. 10, when a 17-year-old girl, who vanished four days earlier
from her Lexington County, S.C., home, ran to a house on Starrett's
street.
   She told the occupants she had been imprisoned in Starrett's home
for four days _ often in handcuffs _ and that she had been sexually
assaulted.
   Three days later, police near Houston found Starrett asleep
behind the wheel of his flashy red Camaro.
   Now, he's charged with kidnapping the 17-year-old, a 12-year-old
and 15-year-old Jean Taylor McCrea, all of whom vanished from
Lexington County, about 50 miles north of Martinez on Interstate 20.
   The 17-year-old and the 12-year-old survived; the youngest girl
was returned to her home shortly after she disappeared last June.
Starrett faces false imprisonment, sodomy and child molestation
charges in those cases.
   Miss McCrea, who disappeared in December, was shot to death.
Police say Starrett led them to her body, and they plan to charge
him with murder.
   Starrett also has admitted attacks on two women near Atlanta, one
near Columbia, S.C., and one near Charleston, S.C., Hensley said.
   Charges against him are pending in all three locations.
   Police say they still don't know why he did it, why he's decided
to talk about it or what other crimes he might have committed.
   ``This was just one of those situations where law enforcement did
not have the clairvoyance to know something that even his own family
members were unaware of,'' Hensley said.
   Police say Starrett, who worked at the Savannah River nuclear
power plant just across the border in South Carolina, was careful to
keep his two lives separate, with his dark side hidden from his
wife, Michelle. The crimes apparently occurred while she was making
regular visits to California, police said.
   Soon after the 17-year-old's escape, a bizarre picture began to
emerge.
   Hensley says Starrett apparently chose at least some of his
victims by going to the homes of people who had placed classified
ads in newspapers, trying to sell merchandise. He abducted girls he
found home alone, police said. The 17-year-old's family, for
example, was trying to sell a water bed.
   The want-ad connection ``is pretty much similar in all the cases
we looked at,'' says Hensley.
   Within days, police in North Carolina, California, Texas, Alabama
and Tennessee were considering Starrett as a possible suspect in
unsolved abductions or sexual assaults in their states.
   One of the managers at the storage warehouse complex where
Starrett rented a unit said she was surprised by Starrett's arrest
and that it seemed uncharacteristic.
   ``He was more or less quiet. He never said too much when he came
in,'' said Paula Snellings, co-manager of the Van Guard warehouse.
   ``I never would have imagined he would do something like that,''
she said. ``He was just too straight acting. He dressed neat, he
drove a pretty car.''

<HEAD>Vegetable Damage Bad In Central Florida</HEAD>

   Temperatures were climbing back toward the
70s and the price of produce also was expected to go up because of
damage from a record-breaking cold snap.
   ``I had a fellow with 500 acres of cucumbers and peppers in south
Hillsborough (County) call me this morning to tell me that they're
completely gone,'' said Tom Burgin, a produce broker in Plant City.
   At the wholesale level, Burgin said, a bushel of peppers that
cost $7 to $8 last week probably will cost him $25 to $30 and will
come from Mexico or the West.
   Florida's produce industry is estimated at more than $1.1 billion
annually, compared with the $1.3 billion-a-year citrus industry that
appeared to have suffered only minimal damage from the cold wave
that arrived Thursday.
   Unseasonably warm weather earlier this winter contributed to
losses because it induced farmers to plant early, said Reggie Brown,
spokesman for Orlando-based Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association.
   ``From talking with several growers yesterday, we did experience
quite a bit of damage on the real cold-sensitive crops _ cucumbers,
watermelons and squash _ and some damage on peppers and tomato
crops,'' he said Sunday.
   He said he expected the crop loss would be up to 30 percent of
potential yield.
   ``What I see is a disaster,'' Roger Harloff, a Palmetto tomato
grower and packer, said Saturday as he stood in a 1,000-acre tract
of young plants. About three-quarters of the plants were dead and
blackening in the bright sunlight. They had been exposed to
26-degree temperatures for more than four hours that morning.
   ``We're all about in the same boat down here,'' Harloff said.
   Tomatoes are the state's largest produce crop, valued at almost
$490 million in 1987, the latest figures available.
   Bill Butler said the damage was the worst in the 10 years he's
worked at Ruskin Vegetable Corp., which ships fresh produce to some
of the largest grocery store chains and terminal markets in North
America.
   ``Our main suit is tomatoes,'' said Butler, general manager of
the Hillsborough company.
   ``The damage to the tomato crop was considerable. I've seen a lot
of kill today. I've seen total loss in some fields, and just a
little bit in a few fields because they were close to the (warming)
water, but I've seen at least some damage in every field, up to
total destruction.''

   A governor says forcible repatriation may be
necessary to stem a tide of job-seekers who have been left stranded
and homeless by the thousands in his southern China province, an
official report said today.
   Governor Ye Xuanping of Guangdong province described the
situation as a ``labor wave washing in from surrounding provinces,''
the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   He has told all cities and counties in the province to form teams
to try to persuade new arrivals to go home, the report said.
   China's migrant workers, estimated as high as 20 million, are a
by-product of the nation's easing of travel restrictions and its
market-oriented reforms, which have encouraged labor mobility.
   Guangdong, located next to Hong Kong and one of China's most
prosperous provinces, is the main Chinese mecca for urban
job-seekers.
   However, Shanghai also is reported to have a ``floating
population'' of 2 million, and more than 1 million non-residents are
temporarily staying in Beijing.
   Today's report said more than 2.5 million people have poured into
Guangdong looking for work since the Lunar New Year holiday ended
two weeks ago.
   Governor Ye was quoted as saying forced repatriation might be
necessary. He ordered all government and private enterprises to
immediately stop hiring new arrivals from other provinces.
   The agency said thousands of people are sleeping at railway
stations, wharves or on the street, mainly in the provincial capital
of Canton.
   Hundreds of thousands more are arriving every day or waiting at
train stations in other provinces for passage to Guangdong, the
report said.
   Transport and hygiene have been strained to the limit, crime is
up, and begging is expected to rise, the report said.
   Some of the jobless new arrivals are trying to make a living by
picking up trash in the streets, the agency said.

<HEAD>Town Asked To Shut Down UMass Anthrax Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Quaker group wants the town to challenge
U.S. Defense Department-funded anthrax research at the University of
Massachusetts, maintaining it could be used in germ warfare.
   ``We are committed to eradicating the research from the campus,''
said John Bonifaz, who heads the effort by the local chapter of the
American Friends Service Committee.
   Anthrax is an infectious disease contracted by wild and
domesticated animals, especially cattle and sheep. It is caused by a
bacterium and can be transmitted to people.
   The town Health Board has scheduled a public hearing Thursday on
the group's claim that the 23-year-old research project poses a
health threat not only to Amherst, but the nation as a whole,
because of its possible military uses, said Town Health Director
Bettye Anderson Frederic.
   The chief scientist on the research project, Curtis B. Thorne,
has maintained his work on the basic structure of the bacterium is
aimed at finding a vaccine for the disease.
   For the past nine years, his work has been financed by grants,
totaling about $1 million from the Defense Department, under its
Biological Defense Research project, according to James Langley,
assistant vice chancellor for university relations and development.
Prior to that it was funded by the National Institute of Health, he
said.
   Diana Stein, a member of the town Health Board who has questioned
the board's involvement in the dispute, said that because the
un-classified research is being openly published it could help all
countries find an anthrax vaccine, eventually rendering useless any
biological weapons using the bacteria.
   The university, which has been pressured by the Quaker group to
dump the research, had not commented on the issue until late last
week when Chancellor Joseph Duffey strongly defended Thorne's work.
   ``As a public institution we will respond to responsible
questions or concerns, but we do not intend to modify policies in
response to threats or demands,'' Duffey said. ``As long as the
scope, methods and results of research are fully and freely
disseminated, we will protect the right of our faculty to conduct
research of their own choosing.''
   ``Unfortunately, two very distinct issues have been presented as
one concern by the AFSC,'' Duffey said. ``The first _ the issue of
public safety _ can be dealt with simply and straightforwardly. The
anthrax research conducted at the university poses no danger to the
health or safety of the researcher, the university or the local
community. Professor Thorne has conducted this research for 23 years
without a single incident or safety violation.''
   Duffey said the second issue of whether the university should
conduct research supported by the Defense Department ``should be
discussed on its own merits and not in the context of an effort to
frighten people with unfounded allegations about threats to public
health and without imputing false motives to the university or
Professor Thorne.''
   He said a variety of research including some ``very basic
scientific investigation'' is currently being funded by the Defense
Department.
   ``Our policies in this area are guided by action taken by the
Faculty Senate and the university's Board of Trustees,'' he said.
``Those policies do not prohibit members from the faculty from
undertaking research so long as the scope, methods and results can
be fully and freely disclosed. We intend to abide by and defend this
policy.''

   Jailed black nationalist leader
Nelson Mandela has told his wife to make no further public
statements on the scandal over her bodyguards that has seriously
tarnished her image, her lawyer says.
   The imprisoned African National Congress leader gave Winnie
Mandela the instructions at a meeting Sunday of more than three
hours at Victor Verster Prison outside Cape Town, said her lawyer,
Essa Moosa.
   She did not speak to waiting journalists when she left the
prison, and Moosa declined to comment on other details Sunday.
   The controversy has prompted major anti-apartheid groups to
denounce Mrs. Mandela, herself a prominent activist.
   Anti-apartheid groups say the bodyguards, known as the Mandela
United soccer club, waged a ``reign of terror'' in Soweto, the black
township outside Johannesburg, and have renounced Mrs. Mandela for
ignoring their appeals that she disband the group.
   Four people with links to Mrs. Mandela and her bodyguards have
been killed in the past two months and two bodyguards have been
charged with murdering one of them, 14-year-old activist Stompie
Seipei.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied any wrongdoing and claims the scandal
stems from a plot to discredit her.
   She has given brief interviews to a few journalists but has not
held a news conference or issued statements to explain her role in
the controversy.
   Mrs. Mandela visited her husband Feb. 15 and decided to act on
his instruction to disband the soccer club and remove team members
from her house.
   Anti-apartheid groups have emphasized they still support Mandela,
the country's most revered black nationalist leader. Mandela has
been in jail since 1962, sentenced to life on sabotage and sedition
charges.
   Mrs. Mandela, a trained social worker, formed Mandela United in
1986, saying she wanted to organize activities for youths
congregating on streets near her house.
   But the group, numbering as many as 30, grew into an unofficial
force of bodyguards who seldom played soccer and have often
antagonized members of the community.
   The controversy came to a head last month when three young men
told a Soweto community meeting the bodyguards abducted them from a
church residence, took them to Mrs. Mandela's home and beat them.
   A fourth person, Seipei, received a more severe beating, said the
men, who contended Mrs. Mandela ``was involved in the events.''
   Seipei's decomposed body was found, throat slit, on Jan. 7 in a
Soweto field. The teen-ager was a well-known activist, despite his
youth, and was eulogized at his funeral Saturday as a hero of the
anti-apartheid movement.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   A bomb blast killed a guard outside a
British cultural center, and a police officer linked the attack to
Moslem protests over British author Salman Rushdie's novel ``The
Satanic Verses.''
   The two-pound bomb exploded Sunday night while the city's
British-run library was closed, police said on condition of
anonymity.
   It killed 65-year-old guard Mohammad Shafi, demolished the
building's guard room and damaged the outside wall.
   Police had earlier said the building housed the British
Consulate, but British diplomats said those offices are elsewhere.
   Asked whether the blast was connected to the furor over Rushdie's
novel, one officer said, ``It appears that way.''
   Many Moslems are outraged by Rushdie's novel, which they say
blasphemes their religion, and Moslem countries including Pakistan
have banned it.
   Six people died and scores more were injured when a mob attacked
an American cultural center Feb. 12 in the capital, Islamabad, to
demand that the United States ban the book.
   Two days later, Iran's fundamentalist leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini called on Moslems to seek out and kill Rushdie and his
publishers. Iranian clerics have posted a bounty of $5.2 million for
Rushdie's head.
   The author, who was born to a Moslem family in India, is in
hiding.

   A United Airlines Flight 811 passenger says he
cheated death by switching seats in the jumbo jet shortly before a
huge chunk of the fuselage tore off in flight, sweeping nine people
to their deaths.
   ``That really saved my life. I think I ended up with the safest
seat on the whole plane,'' said William Van Rij, 70, of
Christchurch, New Zealand.
   Van Rij, a dairy industry consultant, said he usually travels
business class, and likes to sit in the upper deck.
   He said he could not get an upper deck seat on the United
Airlines flight from Los Angeles, but was told to check in early at
Honolulu International Airport before Friday's flight to New Zealand
to switch from the main deck.
   Van Rij said he was given a window seat on the left side of the
upper deck of the Boeing 747-400.
   About 45 minutes into the flight, he said, ``we heard this loud
bang and then it was like a huge storm. The noise was really
tremendous. ...
   ``Pieces of the cabin were flying around. It's very hard to
describe. I'm sure I wold have died in that other seat.''
   Van Rij said he didn't realize until the plane returned safely to
Honolulu about 15 minutes later that a huge hole had been ripped in
the right side, and that the nine people sucked out of the plane had
been sitting in business class on the main deck.
   As the plane descended toward Honolulu, Van Rij said he thought
of the hundreds who died aboard the Titanic, then prayed and
remembered the words to the hymn ``Nearer My God To Thee.''
   ``We all thought that was the finish. You don't handle those
things yourself. You rely on God,'' he said.
   Twenty-seven others were hospitalized, although all but Van Rij
and two others, were released by Sunday.
   Van Rij, who said he underwent heart bypass surgery several years
ago, was hospitalized at the Queen's Medical Center for observation
after suffering chest pain.
   Van Rij's wife, Adrian, 69, flew to Honolulu on Saturday. He said
their six children have been checking on him by telephone.
   Although he marveled at his luck, another man who tried to get a
seat on the upper deck was not so lucky, Van Rij said.
   Two people claimed to have a boarding pass for the same seat, and
after an argument, one went downstairs to the main deck, Van Rij
said.
   Without knowing the passenger's name, United Airlines said it
could not confirm his fate.
   Van Rij said he is not afraid to fly again, even though this is
his second near miss.
   In 1948, he was supposed to fly to Atlantic City, N.J., for a
dairy products exhibition but became ill and could not travel.
   The flight he had booked crashed, killing everyone aboard, he
said.

<HEAD>A Brilliant Cavalcade of Broadway Dances in `Jerome Robbins' Broadway'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS three grafs with other New York reviews. No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Twenty-five years ago when dancing rather than
complicated, computerized scenery was the stuff that made musicals
move, Jerome Robbins was the king of Broadway.
   Now the king has come back to reclaim his throne with ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway,'' a dazzling retrospective of dances and other
numbers from the musicals he helped bring to life from 1944 to 1964.
That list includes such classics as ``West Side Story,'' ``Gypsy,''
``Fiddler on the Roof,'' ``The King and I,'' ``Peter Pan'' and ``On
the Town.''
   The production, which opened Sunday at Broadway's Imperial
Theater, is not a revival. It's a brilliant distillation of the
past, reconstructed and rethought with the utmost precision and care
by Robbins and a team of assistants that includes such veteran
Broadway dancers as Grover Dale, Cynthia Onrubia and Jerry Mitchell.
   Robbins and his cast of 62 dancers demonstrate why the musical,
particularly the American musical, was, and still can be,
exhilarating. There's nothing else quite like it _ Peter Pan soaring
over the rooftops of London, the swagger and shock of the Sharks and
Jets crossing switchblades, Tevye expounding on the importance of
``Tradition'' or a dizzy Charleston that has flappers falling to the
floor and still continuing to dance.
   All are part of ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' but the evening
opens sentimentally with a trio of numbers from ``On the Town,''
Robbins' first show.
   ``On the Town'' tells the story of three sailors out on a 24-hour
spree in World War II New York. But it's a story told not only
through dialogue and song but through dance, too. It combines
elements of ballet with the brash, brassy and confident style of
popular dance.
   It's a technique that Robbins perfected more than a decade later
in ``West Side Story.'' For ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' he has put
together a 30-minute suite of dances from this Leonard
Bernstein-Stephen Sondheim musical, and it is the emotional and
physical heart of the show.
   Comprised of sections from ``The Prologue,'' ``The Rumble,''
``Cool,'' ``America,'' ``The Dance Hall'' and ``Somewhere,'' the
suite compresses the entire modern-day story of Romeo and Juliet
into quite simply the best choreography now on Broadway. And the
dancers attack it with a ferocity that is astounding. There is an
unnerving, on-the-edge menace to their work. When the rival Sharks
and Jets square off, the feeling is electric. The audience gasps
when Bernardo knifes Riff, and the hero Tony inevitably gets drawn
into the tragedy.
   The ``West Side Story'' suite features ensemble dancing at its
very best, but special praise must go to Scott Wise as the cocky
Riff, Nicholas Garr who is a murderous Bernardo and Robert La Fosse
as a poignant, even poetic Tony.
   Another side to Robbins also is revealed in this show. The man
can be funny, not above using a pratfall, a bawdy joke or just plain
corn to get a laugh. All of those elements come together in ``Comedy
Tonight,'' the opening number of the 1962 musical ``A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the Forum.''
   Robbins devised it when ``Forum'' was in trouble out of town. The
song's humor set the tone for the entire musical and helped make it
a hit in New York. The number gets just as many laughs now with
Jason Alexander playing the Zero Mostel role.
   Alexander, a pudgy-faced performer, serves as narrator for
``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' as well as an occasional participant in
the proceedings. Whether soft-shoeing his way through ``I Still Get
Jealous,'' a beguiling Jule Styne melody from ``High Button Shoes,''
or playing Tevye in ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' Alexander has all the
right moves.
   Robbins has constructed the show so it starts slowly, building to
the powerful ``West Side Story'' segment at the end of the first
act. But the pace doesn't let up in Act 2.
   Robbins begins the second act with ``The Small House of Uncle
Thomas,'' the charming ballet retelling of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin''
from ``The King and I.'' East meets West, and Robbins is the
interpreter, blending Oriental dance technique with Broadway
razzle-dazzle. The original setting, designed by Jo Mielziner, and
the striking and colorful Siamese costumes by Irene Sharaff, turn it
into the most visually stunning of the production numbers.
   What makes Robbins so special is the scope of his inventiveness.
He can go from the king of Siam to the queen of burlesque without
missing a beat. He follows ``Uncle Thomas'' with ``You Gotta Have a
Gimmick,'' the hilarious advice given by three strippers to Baby
Louise, the young performer who eventually peels down to become
Gypsy Rose Lee.
   Then he stops everything with ``On a Sunday by the Sea'' from
``High Button Shoes.'' It's a dizzy, raucous ballet involving a bag
of stolen money, a chorus line of bathing beauties, Keystone Kops,
two sets of identical twins and even a gorilla. The action never
stops and neither does the laughter.
   There's a double edge to the joy of ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway.''
If the musical celebrates the past, it also shows up the paucity of
the present.
   Choreography has disappeared on Broadway today. Can anybody
remember the dancing in ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Les
Miserables,'' ``The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' and ``Big River,'' the
last four Tony award-winning musicals?
   With the deaths of Michael Bennett, Bob Fosse and Gower Champion,
Robbins is the last of the great Broadway choreographers. The best
news about his latest show is that the man may be working on a new
theatrical work. Judging from the riches to be found in ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway,'' let's hope the rumor is true.
   In other New York reviews: Frank Rich writes in The New York
Times: ``While `Jerome Robbins's Broadway' may celebrate a vanished
musical theater, it does so with such youthful exuberance that
nostalgia finally gives way to a giddy, perhaps not even foolish,
dream that a new generation of Broadway babies may yet be born.''
   Howard Kissel writes in the Daily News: ``The evening pays
tribute to an ego that is apparently as huge as the talent behind it
... From the tone of the show you would never know musical theater
was about collaboration.'' But, he adds, ``Robbins' Broadway is
inseparable from the Broadway, the New York I imagined growing up in
Milwaukee. I want this show to run and run and run to remind me that
the greatness I imagined back then was indeed a reality.''
   Clive Barnes in the New York Post also notes that ``those same
musicals were among Broadway's finest, not solely on the basis of
the Robbins choreography and direction.'' But, he says, the show
``is magnificent _ a musical of musicals that is all dancing, all
music, and all feeling, revealing Robbins again as Broadway's once
and future king.''

<HEAD>Prime Minister Acknowledges Japanese Aggression in World War II</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a reversal of his earlier remark on Japan's role
in World War II, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said Monday there
was no denying Japan was an aggressor in the conflict.
   ``It is regrettable that my unsatisfactory remark invited
criticism'' from other Asian countries, Takeshita said during a
parliamentary budget committee session. China had been especially
indignant.
   Parliament resumed business after a week's recess for the funeral
of Emperor Hirohito, whose death has renewed debate and national
soul-searching over Japan's role in World War II.
   Takeshita said today that Japan caused grave damage to
neighboring countries through the war. ``There is no denying our
country's aggressive actions during the war,'' he said.
   In a Feb. 18 parliamentary committee session, Takeshita said the
question of whether Japan was an aggressor in World War II would
have to be decided by future historians.
   The remark touched off sharp criticism from countries that
suffered brutal invasions by Japan before and during the war.
   China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who attended the emperor's
funeral, urged the Japanese government to cease promulgating what he
said he viewed as distortions of Japan's militaristic past.
   Qian met Friday with both Takeshita and Foreign Minister Sousuke
Uno.
   Italian and Soviet newspapers have also accused Takeshita of
evading the issue of Japan's wartime aggression and failing to draw
lessons from history.
   The question of war responsibility is sensitive in Japan because
of debate over the personal role of the late emperor. Many
historians say the monarch was a figurehead during World War II,
powerless against the military Cabinet.
   Two Cabinet ministers were forced to step down in 1986 and 1988
after they said Japan's wartime actions were justifiable and did not
constitute aggression.

   Radical students yelling ``Bush go
home'' battled riot police with firebombs and rocks in at least six
cities today to protest the president's visit to Seoul and demand
the withdrawal of U.S. forces.
   About 700 radical students battled riot police around Dongguk
University when they were blocked from marching to the downtown U.S.
Embassy by hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues and
visored helmets.
   ``Yankees go home'' and ``Down with military dictatorship,''
students armed with steel pipes and clubs screamed as they hurled
showers of firebombs and rocks at lines of police blocking the
street.
   No serious injuries or arrests were reported during the 45-minute
clash.
   Bush, in Seoul for a five-hour visit on his way home from China
and Japan, moved around the capital by helicopter and was nowhere
near the violence. The government had mobilized 20,000 riot police
in central Seoul to block protests during his visit.
   Radical students protesting Bush's visit clashed with police in
at least five provincial cities, including the southern city of
Kwangju, where about 3,000 police engaged hundreds of students in
street battles.
   Riot police drove off students who tried to protest outside the
U.S. Air Force base at Kunsan south of Seoul, and clashes were also
reported in Taegu, Pusan and Chongju.
   Outside Dungguk University, riot police fired tear-gas bombs with
rifles into groups of students or pelted them at close range with
tear-gas grenades.
   Several officers were set on fire after being hit by firebombs,
but the flames were quickly extinguished.
   Students burned effigies of Bush and President Roh Tae-woo at a
rally on the school grounds before marching out toward the U.S.
Embassy about three miles away. Marchers beating drums led the
procession.
   During the rally, radical leaders denounced Bush and the United
States, charging that Washington keeps troops in South Korea to
enforce its rule.
   Earlier in the day, riot police broke up an attempt by dissident
leaders to march to the U.S. Embassy to deliver a letter addressed
to Bush demanding withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops based in
South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   About 15 prominent dissidents shouting slogans and carrying
pictures of Bush with red crosses drawn through them were seized and
hauled away after trying to assemble about a block from the embassy.
   ``No Bush visit,'' the small band shouted before they were
overwhelmed by charging police, who kicked and punched some of the
protesters.
   Dissident groups claimed 32 people were arrested today protesting
the visit. Police said there had been arrests, but gave no figures.
   Bush's helicopter passed overhead minutes after a protest on its
way to the nearby presidential mansion, the Blue House, where Bush
met Roh.
   Hundreds of riot police ringed the embassy and other U.S.
facilites because of radicals' threats to hold nationwide
anti-American protests.
   Riot police were also posted at U.S. army bases to prevent
attacks.
   The letter to Bush, released earlier by the nation's main
dissident alliance, denounced the United States as the main source
of division and strife in South Korea. It called for withdrawal of
all U.S. forces from South Korea and charged that Washington rules
the country like a colony.
   ``U.S.A. is the source of all suppression and sorrow to Korean
people since the division of the Korean peninsula,'' the letter said.
   The letter accused Washington of dividing the Korean peninsula
and keeping troops in the South to prevent reunification with
communist North Korea.
   It also denounced Washington for seeking greater access for U.S.
imports to South Korea.
   The letter also said the Bush visit helps Roh, who they want to
oust. Radicals claim Roh's government is a military dictatorship
controlled by the United States.
   Radical students have little public support because of their
violence and extremism, but can assemble thousands of activists and
often clash with riot police in Seoul and other cities.

<HEAD>Chinese Form Environmental Group to Fight Dam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of journalists and engineers are fighting
a huge dam project on the Yangtze River, marking the first time
Chinese intellectuals have united for an environmental cause.
   The group, which is to hold its first news conference Tuesday,
has published a book criticizing the Three Gorges Hydroelectric
Project, a 15,000-megawatt facility that would be the largest water
power project in the world.
   The book represents the first time Chinese journalists have
worked together ``based on their conscience, not on what the
state-run press has told them to do,'' said Dai Qing, editor of the
book prepared by journalists from the People's Daily, Xinhua News
Agency and other leading publications.
   Ms. Dai, an editor at the prestigious Guangming Daily, said she
organized opposition because huge industrial projects ``need to be
discussed by all of society, not just by a few men in a ministry
somewhere.''
   She said all the journalists and engineers participating in the
group are worried about China's environment, which has deteriorated
rapidly during the past 10 years of swift economic growth.
   Her comments also come as an increasing number of Chinese
intellectuals are challenging the government's monopoly on
decision-making power.
   ``Since the 1949 revolution, my country has undertaken thousands
of mistaken projects,'' she said. ``But you would think that in a
planned economy, things would be carried out scientifically. That's
not the case in China.''
   In the 1950s and 1960s, she said, industrial projects were pushed
on their political merits. Indeed, opponents of the Three Gorges
project were branded as ``rightists'' in political campaigns in
those days.
   Now, government ministries compete for scarce resources for their
projects, paying little heed to the interests of the nation as a
whole, she said.
   ``It may be less political, but the behavior is just as harmful
to the country,'' she said.
   Ms. Dai said she realized she was risking her job and possibly
her future by openly voicing her opinion.
   ``But that doesn't bother me,'' she said. ``I cannot keep
silent.''
   Since the Communist revolution, Chinese politicians have been
considering a plan to build a 610-foot dam on the Yangtze River near
the border of Sichuan and Hubei provinces in central China.
   The dam would block the famous Three Gorges, covering forever the
vistas celebrated on Chinese scroll paintings for centuries.
   The project would tame the perennial floods of the mighty
Yangtze, the third longest river in the world after the Nile and the
Amazon. It also would provide energy to nearby cities like Chunking,
China's biggest urban center with 16 million people.
   Factories in Chunking are idle at least 20 percent of the time
because they lack power.
   In January, it looked like the project would be delayed five
years, when Vice-Premier Yao Yilin said economic difficulties would
hold up the plan. But last week, backers of the project held a news
conference and said Yao was only expressing his personal opinion.
   The project would have to tackle massive problems.
   About 1 million people will have to be moved to make room for a
huge reservoir containing 5.19 trillion gallons of water, according
to a Chinese scientist who has worked on the project for several
decades.
   The dam is planned for an area prone to earthquakes.
   ``One jolt and Wuhan (a major industrial center east of the
planned dam), will be wiped out,'' said the scientist, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Finally, much of the land around the dam has been deforested by
peasants seeking wood for their homes and for energy.
   ``We fear the dam will turn the center of China into a big mud
puddle,'' he said. ``The damage to the environment could be
catastrophic.''
   In the face of the problems, China has asked for foreign advice.
   In 1980, an American team of engineers said the project was so
dangerous it ``would be like putting an atomic bomb on China's
head,'' according to Chinese documents obtained here.
   The engineers' report says China should concentrate on tapping
the sparsely populated upper reaches of the Yangtze River for power.
   It also raises concerns about the destruction of the Three
Gorges, the Chinese equivalent of North America's Grand Canyon.

   An officer charged in the death of a
Marine corporal who was abandoned in the desert has been convicted
of disobeying an order, sentenced to four months in the brig and
dismissed from the Corps.
   First Lt. Allen Lawson, 25, was sentenced Saturday in the death
last year of Lance Cpl. Jason Rother, 19, of Minneapolis, who was
left in the Mojave desert when maneuvers ended. Rother was not
reported missing for nearly two days.
   Search teams found only his equipment and an arrow made of stones
at his post, and his remains were discovered Dec. 4.
   A military jury of eight officers found Lawson disobeyed an order
to post road guides in pairs and to submit a list of the guides to
the officer charged with picking up the Marines.
   He was found innocent of the more serious charge of willfully
disobeying the order.
   Several officers in Rother's battalion were reassigned after a
Marine investigation of the incident, and two sergeants who were
Rother's immediate superiors were convicted by a court-martial and
reduced in rank.
   No further charges were expected.
   The conviction will be reviewed by Major Gen. O.K. Steele, the
commanding general of the 2nd Marine Division who convened the
court-martial.

   The 80-pound babies were born two months ago but their gender

<HEAD>Jazz Great Roy Eldridge Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roy Eldridge, one of the great innovators of the
jazz trumpet who gained prominence with Gene Krupa's band and later
toured with Benny Goodman, has died at age 78.
   Eldridge died Sunday at Franklin General Hospital in Valley
Stream. No cause of death was given. His wife, Viola, died three
weeks ago. They had been married 53 years.
   Fellow jazz trumpeter Jon Faddis said Eldridge was ``one of the
most exciting'' jazz trumpeters.
   ``One mistake that experts make is to say that he was the `link'
between Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie, but he was much more.
He was a giant in his own right,'' Faddis said.
   A native of Pittsburgh, Eldridge came to New York City in 1930
and played in Cecil Scott's band and later with Teddy Hill and
Connie's Hot Chocolates.
   He gained national attention when he was the featured trumpeter
and singer with Krupa's band from 1941 to 1943, becoming one of the
first black jazz musicians to be a permanent member of the brass
section of a white band.
   After leaving Krupa's band, he joined Norman Granz's Jazz at the
New York Philharmonic.
   When he left the Artie Shaw band in 1945, Eldridge complained
angrily about the many racial incidents he endured while playing
with the band. He vowed he would never play with a white band again,
although he did later.
   He gained star status in Europe, especially France, when in 1950
he toured with Goodman's sextet.
   He returned to the United States in 1951 and often appeared with
groups that featured such luminaries as Ella Fitzgerald, Johnny
Hodges and Coleman Hawkins.
   Eldridge is survived by a daughter.

   Billy Tipton kept to himself as his jazz
trio toured the West.
   He never went swimming in the motel pools. Waiting for a call
from the group's manager, he'd say, or didn't want to burn his fair
skin. He stayed in a separate room, and didn't talk much about
childhood or family life. When he did talk, he'd say he came from a
broken home and was sent to live with an aunt.
   Drummer Dick O'Neill considered Tipton to be his best friend, but
even he was shocked at what the saxophone and piano player had been
hiding.
   ``Billy Tipton was a biological female,'' pathologist George
Lindholm said after an autopsy on Tipton, who died Jan. 21 from a
bleeding ulcer.
   Interviews with family, friends, colleagues and jazz aficionados
shed little light on Tipton's early years; even her age is
uncertain. Kitty Oakes, who lived as Tipton's wife after 1960 until
they separated about 10 years ago, told a funeral home Tipton was
born Dec. 29, 1914, in Oklahoma City and was raised in Kansas City,
Mo. But no birth certificate has been found.
   What is known is that Tipton, a saxophone and piano player who
liked to write vocal arrangements, performed with the Jack
Teagarden, Russ Carlyle and Scott Cameron bands before forming the
Billy Tipton Trio in the 1950s.
   ``He gave up everything,'' Oakes, who adopted three sons with
Tipton, told The Spokesman-Review newspaper. ``There were certain
rules and regulations in those days if you were going to be a
musician.''
   But jazz experts, including several women who played in bands in
the 1930s, said that while there was discrimination, they doubted
that a talented musician would have had to pose as a man to make it
in the industry. They point to Mary Lou Williams and others who
became famous as jazz musicians and composers.
   ``When I first started, I was skipped over unless they couldn't
get anybody else,'' said pianist Norma Teagarden, sister of Jack
Teagarden. ``At that time, it was hard to break in with a band,
especially if you played saxophone.
   ``There was a lot of resistance. There were not many women in
that business anyway. You've got to be on the road so much, you
can't very well be married, unless your husband was one of the
group.''
   ``I was a piano player and didn't have any problems'' joining a
jazz band, she said. Having three brothers who were established
musicians probably helped, said Ms. Teagarden, who performs in San
Francisco two nights a week.
   Marion McPartland, a jazz pianist who hosts a National Public
Radio jazz show, said, ``It's such a strange story, I don't feel it
any part of my own career. I can't identify with somebody doing
something like that.
   ``There were many women jazz players around, in lots of bands...
I can only say that I've been fortunate in that I've never even had
the feeling of hopelessness she had to do a thing like that,''
McPartland said.
   ``The bands were mostly men and I would think in the 1930s, where
they were on the road doing one-nighters a lot, having a woman on
the bus ... had a sort of inhibiting effect on the language used,
and so on,'' said Stanley Dance, who has written eight books on jazz
musicians. ``From that point of view, a lot of males would not
welcome the woman.
   ``Still, it seems a little bit extraordinary to have done that.''
   ``It certainly was unusual to find a white woman playing piano in
jazz bands,'' said George Simon, a jazz critic. ``I don't think that
society was really well prepared for (women jazz players). Even
jazz, which was as liberal a society as you could find, there wasn't
that much integration.''
   O'Neill said the clamor over the role reversal overshadows the
fact that Tipton was a fine musician with a keen sense of humor.
Tipton's baby face and high voice prompted some cracks in
nightclubs, but the drummer said, ``I would almost fight anybody''
who said Tipton looked too feminine to be a man.
   ``I came from a small town and was a mill worker. He had feminine
features and at first, I thought he was kind of queer. But after I
went to work for him I had no reason to think that,'' O'Neill said.
``He was a straight guy and there was no hanky-panky.''
   Tipton ``was the type of person who would give you the shirt off
his back. He made gobs of money for other people and ended up with
nothing,'' he said.
   Tipton stayed for several months in a rooming house run by the
Teagardens' mother in Oklahoma City, Ms. Teagarden remembers. Tipton
was in her late teens and lived with an older woman. Even then,
Tipton dressed in men's clothing.
   ``Billy was trying to get started. She had a few jobs around
town, but I never heard her play,'' said Ms. Teagarden. Tipton told
members of her trio she had learned to play piano from Norma
Teagarden, who also doubts that Tipton played with her famous
brother Jack.
   ``A lot of people claim those kinds of things. If they did play
with my brother's band, it was usually someone drafted for one night
to replace one of the regulars who got sick,'' she said. ``There's
something very sad about it, to have to live all your life like
that, under false pretenses.''

<HEAD>Attorney Asks U.S. Supreme Court To Dismiss Appointment</HEAD>

   A small-town lawyer ordered by federal
courts to represent convicts says the U.S. Supreme Court should let
him off the case because he would not be able to provide competent
courtroom representation.
   ``I consider myself a business lawyer,'' said John A. Mallard,
34, whose case was scheduled to go before the high court Tuesday.
   ``I consider myself very competent to read the law, construe the
law and argue the law, but not to take on some of these courtroom
responsibilities,'' he said.
   Mallard, a partner in a law firm in this southeastern Iowa town
of 9,500 people, was picked to represent three inmates in June 1987
from a list of more than 100 attorneys compiled by the Volunteer
Lawyers Project, a joint venture of the Legal Services Corp. of Iowa
and the Iowa State Bar Association.
   The inmates at the Iowa State Penitentiary at Fort Madison filed
a civil rights lawsuit alleging that guards and officials mistreated
them, endangered their lives by revealing they were informants and
filed false disciplinary reports against them. One inmate is out on
parole.
   Courts routinely assign lawyers to represent indigent defendants
in criminal cases and the lawyers are paid at taxpayer expense,
which is generally a fraction of what they normally could receive.
In civil rights lawsuits, lawyers are paid expenses and may be paid
a part of any damages won by their clients.
   Mallard's request to be taken off the case was denied by a U.S.
magistrate, a federal district judge and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
   He contends those decisions misinterpreted an 1892 federal
statute that says the court may request rather than order an
attorney to represent an indigent defendant.
   The Iowa attorney general's office, which will argue the case
against Mallard, says he is shirking his obligations.
   ``When a judge asks you to help him or her out in the
administration of justice, it's your duty and obligation to say
`Yes' and to do your best job,'' Deputy Attorney General Gordon
Allen said earlier this month. ``But in Mr. Mallard's case, he
simply didn't say that. He said `I don't want to play, I don't want
to come to your party.'
   ``Mr. Mallard is not incompetent,'' Allen said. ``He's carrying
this all the way to the Supreme Court and doing an admirable job.
Incompetency by itself is not a reason for exclusion of your
responsibility.
   ``Unfortunately for the inmates, their case has just done
nothing, it's gone nowhere while we have litigated Mr. Mallard's
responsibility to represent them.''
   The case is being closely watched by lawyers, said Jack Londen,
chairman of the California Bar Association's legal services section.
   ``We're very troubled by saddling a client with a lawyer who's
unwilling to represent the client, said Londen, who filed a
friend-of-the-court brief on Mallard's behalf. ``It's not fair to
the client.''
   But Iowa Legal Services Corp. Deputy Director Martin Ozga, who
filed a brief to support the state attorney general, said the high
court should compel Mallard to take the case.
   ``If you're talking trial lawyers and that's all they do, you're
talking about a fairly small amount of people,'' Ozga said. ``You'd
never be able to get enough attorneys to represent people.''

<HEAD>Parks Chief Advises Against Feeding Starving Yellowstone Elk, Bison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KUGLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elk and bison in fire
ravaged Yellowstone would be better helped by long-term solutions
rather than by donations of hay, says the National Park Service
director.
   A severe winter and loss of natural foods because of last
summer's drought and huge fires have driven hundreds of elk and
bison over the park boundary into southern Montana.
   In the small Montana town of Gardiner, north of the park,
starving elk are eating ornamental hedges, trees, and hay donated by
sympathetic people. Small herds of elk and buffalo have congregated
in town.
   ``They are skinny and weak,'' said Trudi Taylor, who helped raise
money to feed the animals after one elk died in her yard. She said
she hopes to save younger cows that will soon calve.
   ``In this town, most of the people make their money off these
animals. At least they could give a little back,'' she said,
referring to the area's popularity with hunters and tourists.
   But feeding hay to elk is expensive and can spread disease when
elk gather at feeding stations, Park Service Director William Penn
Mott told a news conference at park headquarters.
   Once rangers start providing hay to elk in Yellowstone, the
expensive practice could continue indefinitely, like at the national
elk refuge in Jackson, said Mott, who was sent on a fact-finding
trip Saturday by new Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.
   Almost 500 of Yellowstone's 2,700 bison have been shot in Montana
in a state-sanctioned hunt, and 250 additional permits have been
issued. More than 2,350 elk from Yellowstone's northern herd of
19,000 were shot by Montana hunters this winter. Inside Yellowstone,
rangers have counted more than 300 elk carcasses.
   Mott said one option he could support was to have the federal
government acquire more winter game range in Montana north of the
park. The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation of Missoula, Mont.,
announced Friday that it will start a special fund toward expanding
winter range for Yellowstone's northern elk herd.
   Mott also said he will ask the Park Service, other federal and
state agencies and conservation groups to help draft a report to
look at Yellowstone's total wildlife management program, which he
called fragmented.
   ``This is needed so that everybody knows what is going to be done
for long-term management of Yellowstone Park and preservation of the
area,'' he said.
   Mott said he hoped a wildlife report would be completed within
six months.
   ``We will look at the total ecosystem and how to best manage
wildlife. If land is being overgrazed, we should look at this.''
   Mott repeated his support for reintroduction of wolves into
Yellowstone, saying they could help keep big-game populations in
balance and are part of the West's ``biological diversity.''
   Elk and bison populations in Yellowstone are near all-time highs
because of recent mild winters.
   The big-game herds are in no danger of extinction, but in some
areas visitors may see fewer animals this year, he said.
   ``Even if winter kill (of northern herd elk) is 50 percent, there
would still be a core that would rapidly reproduce,'' he said.
   Mary Meagher, a Yellowstone biologist, said ``bison have the
biological capacity of recovering from low numbers.'' She recalled
that the park's hundreds of bison started with a remnant population
of 22 animals.
   Montana officials authorized a bison hunt because about half of
Yellowstone's bison carry the disease brucellosis, which some
scientists say could be transmitted to cattle.
   But Meagher said her best information from the Montana state
veterinarian was that no cases of brucellosis in that state had been
traced to Yellowstone Park animals. She pointed out that ranchers
vaccinate their calves against the disease.
   Last year, only 39 bison were shot in Montana's hunt, and this
year's hunt has been denounced as a slaughter by activists such as
Cleveland Amory, president of the Fund for Animals.

   A bomb exploded today at a demonstration
in a northern city protesting ``The Satanic Verses,'' killing one
person and injuring seven, a news report said.
   The demonstrators in Srinagar, Jammu-Kashmir state, were trying
to enforce a general strike to protest Friday's police gunfire
during rioting over the novel, which many Moslems consider
blasphemous, according to the Press Trust of India news agency.
   Nine people were shot and killed Friday.
   The Srinagar bomb was intended for police officers trying stop
demonstrators from closing Srinagar shops, Press Trust said, but
killed a Moslem civilian instead.
   One police officer and two news photographers were among the
injured, the agency added.
   There have been several protests against Salman Rushdie's novel
in India, especially in Jammu-Kashmir, the only state with a Moslem
majority.
   One person was killed there by police during a demonstration on
Feb. 13, a day after police in neighboring Pakistan shot and killed
six people during similar protests.
   Rushdie, who was born into a Moslem family in Bombay, India, is
now a British citizen.

   Inmates at three city jails may have been served
unsanitary food, the city Health Department said after finding more
than 100 health-code violations including signs of mice, roaches and
flies, according to a report published today.
   Inspections last month found unsanitary conditions in a jail on
Rikers Island and two facilities in Brooklyn, the Daily News said,
citing Health Department reports. The three jails house more than
4,500 inmates.
   Of the violations, 24 were deemed hazardous. Health Department
spokesman Barry Adkins said the most serious involved serving food
at the wrong temperature, which could lead to salmonella poisoning.
   The reports cited evidence of mice, flies and roaches in
food-storage areas and in one case, what may have been human
excrement, the News said. They also cited inoperative toilets and
dishwashers, and possible asbestos-containing material.
   The Correction Department has been working with the Health
Department to remedy problems, said Julian Prager, an assistant
correction commissioner, adding that conditions were not that bad.
   ``They could write up anybody's house worse than this,'' he said.

<HEAD>Doctors Blast Washington For Delays in Health Appointments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medicare reform and other health programs are
suffering because the new Bush administration still has many
vacancies in key government jobs, executives of the American Medical
Association charged.
   ``Almost four months after the elections, we are still wondering
who will be named to the post of presidential science adviser,'' Dr.
James H. Sammons said Sunday in a speech closing the AMA's 1989
National Leadership Conference.
   ``There's nobody in charge at the Department of Health and Human
Services,'' Sammons, the association's executive vice president,
added later. ``And we don't have an assistant secretary of defense
for health at the Pentagon.''
   The lack of people in top health positions delays progress on
health programs and puts the executive branch at a disadvantage in
dealing with Congress on upcoming legislation, said Dr. James C.
Todd, the AMA's deputy vice president.
   ``We are terribly concerned about it,'' he said.
   The Senate on Tuesday is likely to confirm Dr. Louis Sullivan for
the Cabinet post at the health department, the largest federal
agency. The 114,000-employee department administers a third of
federal spending.
   Sullivan's confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance
Committee was delayed for three weeks because an FBI background
investigation was incomplete and there were questions about his
finances.
   President Bush acknowledged last week that many positions remain
unfilled in federal agencies. But he said he's not concerned about
the vacancies because the employees remaining from the Reagan
administration share Bush's goals.
   Sammons said the delay on appointments is just one problem, and
that the administration and Congress have shown ``neglect'' on
health issues since the election.
   ``During the campaign for a kinder and gentler America,
President-elect Bush and just about every congressman and senator
you can name talked about taking care of the elderly and the
needy,'' Sammons said. ``Today, while 37 million Americans have no
health insurance at all, and another 17 million have only partial
coverage, the only thing I hear coming out of Washington is taking
$5 billion more out of the Medicare budget.''
   Bush proposed a $5 billion cut to Medicare when he announced his
revisions of President Reagan's 1990 budget proposal, which already
called for reducing spending on the program.
   Sammons called on participants in the conference to influence
government policy to help Americans with inadequate health insurance
and to ensure long-term care for the elderly.

   Federal investigators focused on a jumbo jet's
cargo door locks as the cause of an accident that killed nine
passengers, and United Airlines inspected the baggage compartment
hatches of all its Boeing 747s.
   The Coast Guard, meanwhile, ended a sea and air search of the
Pacific 100 miles southwest of Honolulu after recovering 57 pieces
of debris from the United flight.
   Flight 811 took off Friday for New Zealand with 354 people and
was about 100 miles from Honolulu when the fuselage ripped open as
the plane flew at 22,000 feet. Nine passengers were sucked out of
the 18-year-old jetliner and are presumed dead.
   The pilot, Capt. David M. Cronin, lost power in one of the four
engines and shut down another when a fire indicator light went on,
but the plane returned safely to Honolulu International Airport.
   Among the items recovered were seat cushions, an overhead
compartment, a section of fuselage, safety instruction cards and
personal items including baby shoes and a teddy bear, authorities
said.
   Neither human remains nor the cargo door was recovered Sunday,
said Lee Dickinson, a National Transportation Safety Board
investigator.
   ``Obviously, if we had the door it would be very helpful to us,''
he said Sunday night, but added that other information could
pinpoint the cause.
   ``We are focusing on and looking at the latching mechanism,''
said Dickinson. ``We're also trying to get a better handle on these
latch pin supports and comparing them to others.''
   Investigators have determined that the right, forward cargo bay
door had been closed electronically, with eight latching mechanisms
along the bottom, attached to the plane's frame, as well as a
latching mechanism and a hook pin on each side, said Dickinson.
   A warning system that would have alerted the cockpit if the door
were not closed properly worked during a test Sunday, Dickinson
said. He said he did not know if a warning light went off when the
cargo door tore off the plane.
   Dickinson said there was no evidence that metal fatigue _
weakness caused gradually by long-term use _ or sabotage had caused
the accident, and that FBI explosives experts had been sent home.
   In Washington, U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
agreed today that sabotage or a bomb was not a cause.
   ``It appears now from all the evidence that there was no
explosion of any type,'' he said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
``And so I think we can pretty well rule that out.''
   But he cautioned that the investigators were still working. ``The
preliminary indications, of course, are that the door opened or at
least the skins peeled around the door.
   ``But let's wait till the board reports,'' he said. ``Then we'll
know finally what went on. Premature speculation is very dangerous.''
   United's special checks of the latches, seals, fittings and other
parts of the door mechanisms of its 30 other Boeing 747s were to be
completed by early today, said airline spokesman Rob Doughty.
   ``Nobody told us we had to do this,'' he said. ``It's a
precautionary decision based on the area that was impacted in this
incident.''
   Besides the new inspections, United President Stephen Wolf said
mechanics licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration would
inspect each 747 cargo door upon arrival and would oversee the
closing of each 747 cargo door before takeoff. The closings have
been handled by ramp personnel, his statement said.
   Wolf said the 747 involved in the accident was in compliance with
all FAA airworthiness directives and maintenance requirements
pertaining to cargo doors and that the door worked properly before
the accident.
   However, the cargo door locks had not yet been modified under a
July order that was issued by the FAA after a door in one 747 partly
opened in flight.
   The deadline for that work is the end of this year. Doughty said
he did not know whether United would now rush the modifications.
   United had inspected all 25 of its older 747s covered by the
order but had completed the required reinforcements on just six by
last week, said Doughty.
   Three of the 27 people injured remained hospitalized. Two were
listed in fair condition, including the most seriously injured _ a
48-year-old flight attendant who suffered broken bones in her neck
and upper back and abdominal injuries.
   Passenger William Van Rij, 70, of New Zealand, remained under
observation in stable condition because of a heart condition.
   Van Rij said his life was spared because a changed seating
assignment moved him from the area of the plane where the seats were
sucked out.
   ``That really saved my life,'' he said. ``I think I ended up with
the safest seat on the whole plane.''

   Some 250 spectators cheered as a space
shuttle main engine roared to life and sent smoke across the
Marshall Space Flight Center during a successful 45-second test
firing.
   ``Anything that goes the full duration looks and sounds like a
good test to me,'' center director J.R. Thompson said after
Saturday's test at the northern Alabama base.
   Thompson said the benefits of the test firings should be seen by
the mid-1990s when NASA plans to begin sending pieces of its space
station into orbit aboard the space shuttle.
   NASA engineers fired the engine as part of a series of tests to
make the main engines for the space shuttle more effective.
   John McCarty, head of the propulsion laboratory at Marshall, said
the tests will help reduce internal engine stress, making the
shuttle's main engines last longer.
   ``We're validating changes in the engine _ the first real ones
since it was designed in 1972,'' McCarty said.
   Saturday's 45-second test firing will be followed in three to
four weeks by a longer 100-second firing.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze said today his visit to Tehran signals expanded ties
with Iran, whose revolutionary leader says he wants Moscow to help
combat the ``devilish'' West.
   ``In our opinion, Iran enjoys high international prestige,''
Iran's official news agency quoted Shevardnadze as saying. ``We have
come to the conclusion that it is a must to acknowledge others'
beliefs and respect them.''
   Shevardnadze made his remarks at a meeting with President Ali
Khamenei. On Sunday, he met with Iran's revolutionary leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, for 90 minutes.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said Shevardnadze was quoted as
saying his visit held the promise of closer ties between Iran and
the Soviets despite ``ideological differences.'' IRNA did not quote
Shevardnadze as enumerating the differences, but Iran _ an Islamic
republic _ previously has criticized the Soviet Union's official
atheism.
   Shevardnadze was quoted as saying the two sides agreed that
military confrontations must be reduced and chemical weapons
annihilated worldwide, according to IRNA. He also said Moscow would
push for progress in the Iran-Iraq peace talks, stalled since the
Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war.
   Khamenei told Shevardnadze, ``Iraq must be pressured, and we
think your government can exert this pressure more than anyone
else,'' IRNA said. The Soviet Union was Iraq's major weapons
supplier during the war and is believed to be one of its biggest
creditors.
   IRNA said Shevardnadze repeated his call for the withdrawal of
foreign forces from the gulf, saying ``We have explicitly announced
to the American president that we condemn the U.S. military presence
in the Persian Gulf, and will continue this policy until the
Americans withdraw their troops from the region.''
   The United States has 23 warships in and around the gulf, the
biggest fleet in the strategic waterway where the Soviet Union keeps
seven to nine ships. The Soviet envoy has said Moscow is willing to
withdraw its ships.
   On Sunday, parliamentiary deputies moved to put severing ties
with Britain to a floor vote on Tuesday.
   Last week, Britain recalled its diplomats from Tehran to protest
Khomeini's death decree for British author Salman Rushdie. IRNA said
editorials in Tehran newspapers today supported breaking ties.
   It said Shevardnadze did not ask Khomeini to withdraw his order
for Moslem zealots to assassinate Rushdie, whose novel ``The Satanic
Verses'' is considered blasphemous by many Moslems.
   Britain reportedly had asked Shevardnadze to press Khomeini to
reprieve Rushdie, but IRNA said, `There was no mention of the
(Rushdie) affair in Shevardnadze's speech.''
   Shevardnadze, the highest ranking Soviet official to visit Iran
since the 1979 Islamic revolution, met Khomeini two days after the
Iranian spiritual leader declared Iran does not need relations with
the West.
   Khomeini has been widely condemned in the West for issuing the
death decree.
   At their meeting, Khomeini stressed to Shevardnadze the
importance of ``the expansion of strong ties in various dimensions
in confronting the devilish acts of the West,'' Tehran Radio
reported.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, broadcast a recording of
excerpts from the dialogue and Tehran Television showed Khomeini,
wearing a skullcap and robes with a blanket over his knees, talking
to Shevardnadze.
   Afterward, Shevardnadze met Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and
delivered an invitation for him to visit Moscow, according to IRNA.
Tehran Radio said the two agreed to set up mechanisms for
``regulating political contacts'' between Moscow and Tehran.
   Rushdie, who was born into a Moslem family in India, has been in
hiding since Khomeini issued his execution order Feb. 14. Iranian
clerics have put a bounty of $5.2 million on his head.
   All 12 European Common Market countries as well as Norway, Sweden
and Canada have recalled their top diplomats from Iran to protest
the death decree.
   Shevardnadze was to return to Moscow today after his 10-day
Middle East trip.

   A bomb killed a Moslem civilian today in India during a
demonstration over ``The Satanic Verses'', and police linked a fatal
blast in Pakistan to Moslem protests over the novel.
   The publisher, meanwhile, is considering labeling unsold copies
of Salman Rushdie's book with an apology in an effort to defuse the
protests, a London newspaper reported today.
   Thousands of Shiite Moslems demonstrated in Lebanon and Iran on
Sunday in support of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order Feb. 14
that Moslems seek out and kill the British author and his publishers.
   The Press Trust of India news agency reported that today's
bombing in Jammu-Kashmir state was aimed at police who were trying
to prevent demonstrators from closing shops in Srinagar. However, a
Moslem civilian was killed instead and seven people were injured,
including a police officer and two news photographers, Press Trust
said.
   The news agency said the demonstrators were trying to enforce a
general strike to protest Friday's police gunfire during rioting
over the novel in Bombay. Nine people were shot and killed.
   At least 18 people have been killed since Feb. 12 in India and
Pakistan in violence related to ``The Satanic Verses.''
   On Sunday, a bomb blast killed a guard outside a British cultural
center in Karachi, Pakistan, police said.
   Police identified the victim as Mohammad Shafi, 65, and said the
explosion destroyed the building's guard room.
   Asked whether the blast was connected to the furor over Rushdie's
novel, one officer said, ``It appears that way.'' He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In London, a senior Viking Penguin editor attending an emergency
meeting of the Writers' Guild of Great Britain said hardback copies
of the novel were selling so well that a paperback edition, due out
in August, might be delayed for ``crude commercial'' reasons.
   But the editor denied reports that Viking Penguin was considering
canceling the paperback edition to appease Moslems who consider the
book blasphemous.
   ``We are continuing to make the book available,'' he was quoted
as telling The Guardian, a London newspaper. ``It's simply not
possible to keep up with demand.''
   ``If there is a way to keep the book in print and prevent further
loss of life, and if the way to do that is print some form of
apology, then maybe we should do that,'' he was quoted as saying. He
asked not to be identified because of the death threats.
   Viking Penguin refused to comment today on its plans for the book.
   Thousands of American Moslems protested the novel over the
weekend in Boston and New York.
   About 5,000 pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems burned effigies of Rushdie
during a march in Beirut, Lebanon, on Sunday.
   Tehran television reported thousands of Moslems also demonstrated
in the holy city of Qom, chanting ``We are at your service
Khomeini'' and ``Death to America!''
   Rushdie, 41, was born to a Moslem family in India. He has been in
hiding since Khomeini ordered Moslems to kill him and Iranian
clerics put a bounty on his head of up to $5.2 million.
   Rushdie has apologized for any distress his novel caused, but
Khomeini rejected the overture.
   The 12 European Community countries as well as Norway, Sweden,
and Canada have recalled their ambassadors from Iran in protest, and
Iran has retaliated by withdrawing its top envoys from those
countries.
   Iran's parliament is to vote Tuesday on whether to sever
relations with Britain because of the furor over ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   The nation's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported today
that newspapers believed such a move would be a ``practical step''
and would reflect Khomeini's position that relations with the West
are unnecessary.
   Moslems say the book insults Islam by portraying the wives of the
prophet Mohammed as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran,
the Moslem holy book, rather than receiving it from Allah.
   The book has been banned in Iran, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Jordan,
Egypt, South Africa, India, Pakistan and Brunei.

   Fire touched off by a train derailment spread
to another railroad tanker car early today, forcing thousands of
people to keep out of their homes and schools, authorities said.
   Only one of the four cars of highly flammable butane that caught
fire Sunday night was burning shortly before dawn, but then fire
started at another car, said Lt. Richard Summerlot of the Akron Fire
Department. Firefighters stood by, waiting for the fire to go out.
   The burning cars were among 17 that derailed from a CSX
Transportation train on the grounds of the B.F. Goodrich Chemical
Plant, Fire Chief George Romanoski said.
   ``I was watching TV and I heard something and saw the whole sky
light up,'' said Minnie Herrington, 40, who was brought to a shelter
with her four children, ages 4 to 11.
   ``It sounded like a gunshot.''
   Thirteen people were treated at Akron General Hospital, most
suffering from inhalation of smoke and fumes. One man was admitted,
in fair condition.
   About 1,500 homes within a half mile of Sunday evening's accident
were evacuated, police said. They estimated the number of evacuees
at 2,000.
   Shelters were set up at Kenmore High School and the University of
Akron for those who could not stay with friends or relatives.
   Schools in this city of 250,000 were closed and metropolitan bus
service was canceled today because the city bus garage is near the
derailment site, Summerlot said. Businesses in the area also were
closed today, he said.
   The 45-car train was en route from Willard to Akron and back to
Willard when the derailment occurred, CSX spokesman Lloyd Lewis said.
   The cause was under investigation.
   Nine cars carried highly flammable butane, Lewis said. The eight
other cars that derailed carried non-hazardous materials such as
vegetable oil, clay and sand, he said.
   Another car on the train contained butadiene, which may produce
hazardous smoke when burned, but it was too far from the burning
cars, Mayor Don Plusquellic said.
   There was some concern, however, that the fire could spread to
the Goodrich plant, which also housed butadiene, he said.
   Butane is non-toxic when burned and is used as a fuel and an
aerosol propellant. Butadiene is a petroleum derivative used to make
synthetic rubbers and resins.
   ``The area was evacuated because of the danger of explosion in
the surrounding tank cars,'' said Romanoski.
   He said evacuees would not be allowed to return to home until the
fire was extinguished.
   More than 80 people were evacuated to the University of Akron,
which would be closed at least until noon, said spokesman Phil
Zimmer.
   About 550 people were taken to Kenmore, but many had left the
school to stay with relatives or friends. About 300 people remained
at midnight.
   The mood of the evacuees ran from ``resignation to almost ...
festive,'' said Brian Williams, assistant school superintendent.
Children were given access to the cafeteria and the gymnasium, where
several were playing basketball.
   ``The kids are all in a good mood,'' Williams said. ``We've had
people bring their rabbits, guinea pigs and dogs. I've been in this
business 25 years. A woman comes up to me with a dirty diaper and
says `Where do I put this?' I've never been asked that before.''

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani has
pledged a ``clean sweep'' of appointed officials in city government,
referring to his as-yet-unannounced mayoral campaign as if it were
under way.
   Appearing Sunday on WNBC-TV's ``News Forum,'' Giuliani took Mayor
Edward I. Koch and the Democratic Party to task for allowing
inefficiency and corruption to fester.
   When appointments are dictated by political party bosses,
``You're just going right down the primrose path to inefficient
government, ineffective government, and then sometimes just corrupt
government,'' Giuliani said.
   Giuliani, a Republican, gave some of his strongest indications to
date that he would enter the mayoral race. ``I'm going to make it
very clear from the very beginning that anyone that donates money to
my campaign should do it because they want reform, nonpartisan
government in New York,'' he said.
   The only announced Republican candidate, cosmetics heir Ronald
Lauder, already has spent around $750,000 in his quest for the
nomination, according to the New York Post.
   City primary elections will be held in September, and the general
election is set for November.
   Giuliani stepped down last month after 5{ years as U.S. attorney
in Manhattan, where he gained fame with prominent prosecutions of
corrupt political figures, Wall Street executives, mobsters and
others.
   He has said he is exploring a mayoral candidacy and has
authorized fund-raising in his behalf, but has not declared his
intention to run.
   Key issues are crime, drugs, education, housing, homelessness and
jobs, Giuliani said. He urged a city law to confiscate property from
drug dealers, favored a bill curtailing the warehousing of vacant
apartments and was noncommittal on commercial rent control.
   ``The city is in very, very bad shape, and the mayor is
responsible for it,'' Giuliani said.

   Thousands of mourners went to the hillside
tomb of Emperor Hirohito to pray today, the first day the imperial
cemetery was opened to the public since his burial.
   Under blue skies and against a backdrop of pine and cedar trees,
about 7,000 people visited the cemetery, bowing their heads and
clapping twice before Hirohito's tomb in the traditional gestures of
worship at shrines of Japan's Shinto religion.
   Hirohito died of cancer on Jan. 7 at age 87. Posthumously known
as Emperor Showa, he was commemorated Friday in a state funeral in
Tokyo attended by representatives of 164 countries, including
President Bush. Later the same day, he was entombed in the Musashi
Imperial Cemetery, a wooded enclave in these foothills about 30
miles west of Tokyo.
   Only palace officials and members of the imperial family took
part in the entombment ceremony, deeply steeped in ancient Shinto
rites and carried out to the strains of classical court music from
wind instruments and gongs.
   Today, about 40 mourners, including 15 members of a group
described by guards as rightists loyal to the emperor, were the
first to enter the site of Hirohito's tomb with their heads bowed
and coats removed.
   One young rightist wore a headband with a red rising sun in the
style of World War II kamikaze pilots who flew suicide missions in
the name of the emperor.
   Another mourner, 63-year-old Masae Yamamoto, said he came from
Tokyo with mixed feelings.
   ``I spent the last two years of the (past) war at the front and
... I have some reservations about the emperor's responsibility for
the war.''
   He added, however, ``After the difficult years of rebuilding the
country, I also feel I share a common experience with the emperor
and find myself feeling nostalgic after his passing.''
   The cemetery will close again at the end of March to allow
completion of the emperor's mausoleum. It will be covered in stone
and landscaped over the next year.
   Many visitors took photographs of the tomb and surrounding hills.
They then strolled over to the mausoleums of Hirohito's parents,
Emperor Taisho and Empress Teimei, to pay their respects there as
well.

   An anonymous caller claimed today that a
Palestinian group abducted a missing 21-year-old Israeli paratrooper
and is holding him captive.
   The caller told Agence-France Presse he represented the
Palestinian Arab Army, a previously unknown group.
   Army officials said they did not know if the claim was legitimate
or whether the soldier was kidnapped.
   ``He told us they had kidnapped the soldier and that there will
be a videotape released in the next few days'' to authenticate the
claim, said Jean-Luc Porte, a journalist at the French news agency
in Jerusalem.
   The caller said that demands for the release of the soldier would
be made ``in the next few days.''
   Porte said the man spoke Arabic and did not identify himself by
name.
   The caller was asked if the Palestinian Arab Army was affiliated
with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and he denied any
connection, Porte said.
   An army spokesman said he had not heard about the claim of
responsibility or that the soldier had been kidnapped. The army was
checking the claim, said the spokesman, who cannot be identified by
name under military regulations.
   The missing paratrooper, Avi Sassportas, 21, disappeared Feb. 16
after he left his base in southern Israel to return to his home in
Ashdod.
   He last was seen waiting at a junction near the Mediterranean
city of Ashkelon. He was armed with an M-16 assault rifle, Israel
radio reported.
   Thousands of police, soldiers and civilian volunteers have
searched for the soldier.

   EL-BIREH, Occupied West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian stabbed an
Israeli border police soldier in the shoulder today and then was
shot and captured after a chase, Arab reports and the military said.
   The attack in El-Bireh followed two killings of Israeli soldiers
and the disappearance of another. The violence comes despite
Palestine Liberation Organization pledges to refrain from deadly
attacks and could undermine tentative efforts to arrange a peace
dialogue.
   Also today, in the occupied Gaza Strip, troops shot and wounded
at least eight Palestinians in clashes in the refugee camps of Shati
and Jabaliya.
   In the attack in El-Bireh, the border police soldier was stabbed
twice in the shoulder, shouted ``I'm wounded,'' and then pursued his
assailant with other soldiers, the army commander for El-Bireh said.
   The commander, identified only as Colonel Chai, said the border
police soldier was part of a patrol walking on the edge of the
market in El-Bireh, about 10 miles north of Jerusalem.
   The assailant, identified as a teen-ager from Ramallah, was shot
in the head and back, Chai said. He said troops were searching for
the knife.
   The condition of the assailant was not immediately known.
   After the attack, the army ordered stores in the market area
closed to prevent further violence, said an army spokesman, who is
not identified under military regulations.
   Soldiers rounded up about 200 Palestinians, said an Arab
reporter, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. One suspect was
beaten by soldiers and hospitalized, Arab reports and hospital
officials said.
   The wounded soldier, a member of the Druse Arab minority, was in
stable condition, Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem reported.
   On Friday, a 24-year-old reserve paratrooper died in the West
Bank city of Nablus when a concrete block was dropped on his head.
Nablus has been under curfew since then, and the search continues
for the killer.
   An unarmed, out-of-uniform soldier was stabbed to death Feb. 18
in Jerusalem's Old City. Two days earlier, another soldier was
reported missing just north of the Gaza Strip.
   An anonymous caller today told the news agency Agence-France
Presse that the Palestinian Arab Army kidnapped the soldier Feb. 16
and was holding him captive. The army said it did not know if the
claim was legitimate.
   Seventeen Israelis, including six soldiers, have been killed
during the Palestinian uprising. At least 386 Palestinians have been
killed since the revolt began Dec. 8, 1987, most shot by soldiers
during violent protests by Palestinians.
   The uprising is aimed at ending Israeli occupation in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel seized the areas in the 1967 Middle East
war.

<TEXT>
   Bernard Goetz, who in 1984 shot four young men
he said were going to rob him on a New York City subway, today lost
a Supreme Court challenge to his conviction for illegally possessing
a gun.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that Goetz was
denied a fair trial.
   Goetz, who was sentenced to a year in jail and fined $5,000,
began serving his term at the Rikers Island prison in New York City
last month. He is eligible for, but not assured of, parole after 51
days.
   His case won worldwide attention, prompting debates on
self-defense and racism. Some called Goetz, a 41-year-old
electronics engineer, a hero. Others called him a cold-hearted
vigilante and racist.
   Goetz is white. The four teen-agers he shot are black.
   The subway shooting occurred Dec. 22, 1984 after one of the
youths approached Goetz and asked him for $5. Goetz later said he
feared he was going to be mugged and robbed.
   Goetz fled from the subway car and left New York City. Nine days
later he surrendered to police in Concord, N.H.
   After a 1987 trial, Goetz was acquitted of attempted murder,
assault and other charges. He was convicted only on the
gun-possession charge.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Goetz argued that he
was denied a fair trial by the judge's instructions to jurors.
   The appeal said the judge violated Goetz's rights by telling
jurors they ``must'' _ rather than ``may'' _ convict him if they
found that all elements of the illegal possession charge had been
proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
   The jurors also were told they ``must'' acquit Goetz if they
found that the proof was insufficient to sustain any element of the
illegal possession charge.
   After his trial, jurors told reporters that Goetz was justified
in shooting the men he thought were going to attack him. But they
said they had no choice but to find him guilty of illegally
possessing a gun.
   Lawyers for Goetz told the justices, ``The jury, by such
compulsive language, was even potentially precluded from considering
all factors, beyond the mere statutory elements, toward its
determination of (Goetz's) ultimate guilt.''
   The appeal noted that Goetz had been mugged several times
previously, and that he had unsuccessfully sought a permit to carry
a gun.
   Prosecutors urged the justices to reject the appeal. ``There is
not now _ and never has been _ the slightest conflict of opinion
among federal and state appeals courts about the constitutionality
of the kind of instruction delivered to (Goetz's) jury,'' they said.
   Goetz's initial sentence was overturned by a state appeals court,
and he was resentenced last Jan. 13.
   The case is Goetz vs. New York, 88-1122.

   Former Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and former
Brooklyn, N.Y., Democratic boss Meade Esposito today lost Supreme
Court appeals aimed at overturning their convictions for exchanging
illegal gratuities.
   The court, without comment, cleared the way for Biaggi's
imprisonment on a 2{-year term. Esposito was sentenced to two years
probation and 500 hours of community service.
   Each man also was fined $500,000.
   Biaggi, who served 10 terms in Congress, was forced to resign
from the House of Representatives last Aug. 5 following his
conviction on racketeering charges in another case.
   He has been sentenced to eight years in prison in that case,
which involves the Wedtech Corp. and charges that the ex-congressman
illegally took $1.8 million in stocks and cash from the Bronx, N.Y.,
business.
   The case acted on today involved charges that Biaggi accepted
free vacations from Esposito in exchange for helping a financially
troubled ship-repair company in Brooklyn.
   Biaggi was convicted in November 1987 of accepting gratuities for
official acts and obstruction of justice, and Esposito was convicted
of giving the gratutities.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the convictions last
August after rejecting arguments that prosecutors violated the
defendants' rights by excluding some Italian-Americans from the jury.
   The appeals court said the prospective jurors were excluded for
legitimate reasons other than their Italian descent, and noted that
at least two Italian-Americans served on the jury that convicted
Biaggi and Esposito.
   The case is Biaggi vs. U.S., 88-828.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Georgia City Collect Flood Control Legal Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let
Brunswick, Ga., collect a $324,000 reimbursement it won, and then
lost, from the federal government for legal costs incurred in a
fight over flood control.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that the coastal city does not qualify for the reimbursement.
   The dispute dates back to Brunswick's request in the early 1980s
to participate in the federally subsidized National Flood Insurance
Program for communities that carefully control development of land
likely to be flooded.
   In 1985, Brunswick sued the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
which runs the program, and others over alleged errors in
calculating Brunswick's eligibility.
   The lawsuit ended in a settlement prior to any trial, and a
federal trial judge ordered the government to pay Brunswick $324,000
for lawyer fees and other costs the city had incurred.
   The award was made under the Equal Access to Justice Act. Under
that law, a local government that engages the federal government in
legal battle is eligible for reimbursement if its net worth is less
than $7 million and the federal government's position in the dispute
was not ``substantially justified.''
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last July 11 threw out the
$324,000 award on two grounds. It said Brunswick's net worth exceeds
$7 million and the federal government's position in the flood
control dispute was substantially justified.
   On the net-worth issue, Justice Department lawyers relied on the
city's annual financial report showing ``total municipal equity'' to
be just over $22 million when the lawsuit was filed. They said that
figure reflected the city's net worth.
   But city lawyers said the ``net worth'' term used in the Equal
Access to Justice Act should not include those assets generally not
available to pay off debts.
   The city's water and sewer system wrongly was counted as an asset
because its worth is not available for debt payment, the city's
lawyers argued.
   The 11th Circuit court said net worth is determined by
subtracting ``total liabilities'' from ``total assets'' _ including
the city's water and sewer system.
   The appeals court also ruled that U.S. District Judge Anthony
Alaimo abused his discretion in deciding that the federal
government's legal position in the underlying dispute had not been
substantially justified.
   The case is Brunswick vs. U.S., 88-948.

   The Supreme Court today rejected ``reverse
discrimination'' arguments by a white Vallejo, Calif., firefighter
denied a promotion that went to a black man with a slightly lower
test score.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that upheld the
black man's promotion to help achieve better racial balance within
the city fire department.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the promotion
was lawful.
   Vallejo's ``plan concerning the promotion of qualified minority
employees is a minimally intrusive means to achieve racial balance
and is thus a narrowly tailored remedy'' for past discrimination,
the appeals court said.
   ``The city's plan provides for consideration of race only insofar
as the merit principle can be preserved, making it a moderate and
gradual remedy,'' the 9th Circuit court added.
   The city in 1983 denied a promotion to the job of
firefighter-engineer to Patrick Higgins, who is white. The job
instead went to Errol Cooley, who is black.
   Higgins achieved the top score, 94.17, on a competitive
examination for the job. Cooley's score was 93.09. Both men were
beginning-level firefighters in Vallejo.
   City officials stressed the need for better racial balance in the
department. Vallejo has a minority population of 40 percent,
including 18.75 percent black.
   Only three of the city's 80 firefighters, 3.8 percent, were black
when Cooley was promoted.
   The 9th Circuit court, in upholding the promotion, relied heavily
on a 1987 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the promotion of a woman
who scored slightly lower than a male candidate for a county
transportation job in California.
   The appeals court said Cooley's promotion ``satisfies even the
most rigorous equal protection requirements'' of the Constitution.
   The case is Higgins vs. Vallejo, 87-1283.

   Egypt's foreign minister today praised Israel
for surrendering a disputed border enclave to Egypt, saying he hopes
the action can help advance efforts in the Middle East.
   Esmat Abdel-Meguid spoke to reporters 12 hours after Egyptian,
Israeli and American officials signed accords to end by mid-March
Israel's 22-year occupation of Taba, a 250-acre beach resort on the
northern tip of the Red Sea.
   ``Egypt's resumption of sovereignty over Taba is a victory for
peace and supports the possibilities of the peace process,''
Abdel-Meguid said. ``It is proof that if serious determination and
good will are available, disputes can be resolved by peaceful ways.''
   One agreement signed at Taba's Sonesta hotel stipulates that the
Egyptians pay the hotel's Israeli owner $37 million. Another set a
price of $1.15 million for a nearby holiday village of beach cabanas
and a cafeteria.
   The agreements give all tourists, including Israelis, 14 days'
access without visas from Israel to Taba and southern Sinai.
   They also put the border between Egypt and Israel back to its
position prior to the 1967 Middle East war, when the Jewish state
occupied the Sinai peninsula.
   Taba became an irritant in Egyptian-Israeli relations in 1982
when Israel withdrew from the Sinai under the U.S.-brokered Camp
David agreement, but refused to give up the tiny patch of beach.
After years of fruitless negotiation, the two former Middle East
foes decided in 1986 to let international arbitrators decide Taba's
fate.
   On Sept. 29, the arbitration committee ruled that Taba be
returned to Egypt but left open the fate of the beachfront. Except
for the tourist facilities, the enclave includes virtually nothing
but barren rock and sand hills.
   After obtaining easy access for its tourists, Israel finally
signed Sunday's series of agreements that will put Taba back in
Egyptian hands by noon March 15.
   The United States signed the agreement because it helped
negotiate the pact.
   ``Egypt hopes that completion of the Israeli withdrawal becomes
the start of a new stage during which we can expand the peace
process in the area,'' Abdel-Meguid said.
   At the 40-minute signing ceremony, Egyptian, Israeli and American
delegates expressed similar hopes that future disputes between
Israel and its Arab neighbors be solved through negotiations.
   Egyptian Tourism Minister Fuad Sultan, who signed parts of the
agreement package for Egypt, said his government plans further
tourist development of Taba's bay, bordered by sandy beachs dotted
by palm trees.
   In the past, most occupants of the hotel, built in the early
1980s, have been Israelis, but Egyptian officials have said they
plan campaigns to lure Egyptian tourists as well.
   Because of the sensitivity of what it considered Egyptian land
under foreign occupation, the government made Taba off-limits to
Egyptians during much of the seven-year squabble over the area.

   Fang Lizhi, the dissident Chinese police prevented
from attending a banquet given by President Bush, said today the
president's statement of regret was ``a beginning'' but he hoped for
more.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush learned
today that Fang and his wife were barred the banquet Sunday night,
and that he ``expressed regret'' to Vice Premier Wu Xueqian before
flying to Seoul, South Korea.
   Fitzwater said it is the president's view that such problems as
human rights should be dealt with in a low-key and private manner.
   The 53-year-old Fang, China's most famous dissident, is also an
internationally respected astrophysicist. He maintains that Marxism
is a failure in China and that a multiparty system is needed to
guarantee basic human rights.
   The U.S. Embassy said Ambassador Winston Lord met today with
Foreign Ministry officials to discuss the incident. Details of the
meeting were not immediately available.
   Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, were traveling with an American
couple to the banquet when police stopped their car a few blocks
from the hotel where the banquet was held and accused the driver of
speeding. Police prevented them from walking to the hotel, then
halted a taxi to which they had transferred and ordered a bus not to
pick them up.
   They insisted Fang and Li were not on the guest list, although
the official U.S. list bore their names. Police then tailed the four
for 90 minutes as they walked to Lord's residence to seek help.
   Fang told about two dozen reporters jammed into his tiny
apartment today that he was ``a little bit afraid'' Sunday night
because of the many police.
   But he added, ``I can't change my views because of fear. We need
freedom and human rights.''
   ``I was very angry,'' said his wife. ``I'm not particularly
afraid. It was crazy, stupid.''
   Bush did not raise human rights issues during his two days of
meetings with Chinese leaders. However, senior leader Deng Xiaoping
and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang both stressed that
domestic stability is more important now than democratic reform.
Zhao warned in unusually strong language that any American support
for China's dissidents would harm the bilateral relationship.
   Fang was careful not to criticize Bush, saying, ``It's too early
for me to evaluate him.''
   But he said, ``I hope they (the Americans) say something more in
the next few days.
   ``Regarding the United States, I have a principled criticism: I
want it to adopt a single standard toward human rights and not a
double standard,'' he said. ``I think there are indeed some double
standards'' in the United States' open criticism of the Soviet
Union's human rights record but not China's.
   But he added, ``Of course, we Chinese must win our own human
rights for ourselves.''
   Fang, who is popular among Chinese students, said he did not want
the police action against him to trigger student demonstrations. But
he said he also does not expect the police action to silence
government critics.
   ``I have received many phone calls from friends. They assured me
they support me and they were very angry with the government,'' Fang
said. ``One friend said a couple of days ago that we should be
quiet, not speak so much. Today he called and said we should speak
more.''
   Several other government critics attended the Bush banquet
without interference. But none is as well-known outside China as
Fang, who stepped into the political limelight in 1986 with eloquent
speeches to college students calling for democracy and human rights.
   Authorities blamed him for a nationwide wave of student
demonstrations in the winter of 1986-87 and expelled him from the
ruling Communist Party. Recently, they refused him permission to go
to the United States to attend a scientific conference and teach.
   Fang recently sent an open letter to senior leader Deng calling
for an amnesty for political prisoners, and the call was taken up by
several dozen other leading writers and thinkers who sent a second
letter.

<HEAD>Poll: Daley Holds Slight Lead Over Sawyer</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs on end with background on other mayoral elections,
including 1987 loss of black incumbent mayor in Charlotte, N.C.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the mayoral primary in its final day, a poll
showed Mayor Eugene Sawyer narrowing the gap against Richard M.
Daley, who hopes to win the job his father held for two decades.
   The poll, taken Wednesday through Friday for WBBM-TV and the
Daily Southtown Economist, showed Daley's lead over Sawyer had
narrowed to 7 percentage points, 47-40 percent.
   A substantial 11 percent of the 885 registered voters polled were
undecided, and the poll's margin of error was 4 points.
   Two weeks earlier, the same poll showed Daley held a 10 point
lead _ 43 to 33 percent.
   ``The mayor is poised in a very good position now to overtake
Daley,'' said Sawyer's campaign spokesman Larry Horist. ``This race
is virtually tied up.''
   Daley had no immediate comment about the poll.
   Whether it's too late for Sawyer to avoid becoming the first
black mayor of a major city to be defeated by a white remains the
question.
   With the Democratic primary set for Tuesday, both candidates
campaigned vigorously during the weekend, each invoking the name of
the late Mayor Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor, and
citing the need to heal the city's racial divisions.
   ``Harold Washington was a strong mayor who loved the city,''
Daley, the Cook County state's attorney, told an all-black
congregation, one of three he visited Sunday.
   ``My father was a strong mayor who loved the city,'' added Daley,
the son of the late Richard J. Daley, who was Chicago's mayor for 21
years.
   Sawyer campaigned at 10 black churches. At the Antioch Baptist
Church, the mayor received a standing ovation for his solo rendition
of the hymn ``How Great Thou Art.''
   Jesse Jackson campaigned with Sawyer, leading supporters in
chants of ``maintain the gains,'' saying he wants to keep the
multi-racial city government that Sawyer has helped build.
   Sawyer has gained steadily in polls during recent months, while
Daley, despite his lead, remains below 50 percent.
   The latest Southtown Economist-WBBM poll indicated that the
electorate remained divided along racial lines.
   Sawyer received the support of 73 percent of registered black
voters surveyed to Daley's 8 percent. Whites split 79-14 percent for
Daley. Hispanics favored Daley by 2-1.
   The poll also found that 80 percent of blacks questioned said
they definitely will vote Tuesday, versus 73 percent of whites.
   Chicago's population is about 40 percent black, 40 percent white
and nearly 20 percent Hispanic.
   Whoever wins the primary faces the Republican challenger and the
third-party candidacy of black alderman Timothy Evans in April 4's
general election.
   However the Democratic race turns out, the GOP candidate in April
will be white _ and could be former Democratic power Edward
Vrdolyak, who has launched an 11th-hour Republican primary write-in
campaign.
   Vrdolyak, who joined the Republican ranks after losing to
Washington in 1987, is challenging the officially endorsed GOP
candidate, Dr. Herbert Sohn, a physician and lawyer.
   If Sawyer wins the Democratic primary, the black vote could split
between Sawyer and Evans in the general election, bringing a white
back into the mayor's office.
   If Daley and Vrdolyak win, Evans would gain from the split in the
white vote.
   The winner will fill out the remaining two years in Washington's
term.
   The era of big-city black mayors in the United States began in
1967, when Carl Stokes was elected in Cleveland. Cleveland now has a
white mayor, but that happened after Stokes decided not to seek
re-election.
   Amongthe nation's very largest cities, no black incumbent has
ever lost to a white. But in Charlotte, N.C., the nation's 44th
largest city, incumbent Mayor Harvey Gantt, a black, lost to a white
challeger in 1987.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Lawyer Loses Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A civil rights lawyer who says the government
violated his rights by eavesdropping on his conversations with
clients lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, refused to revive Arthur Kinoy's
lawsuit for monetary damages.
   Kinoy's suit stems from FBI wiretapping from 1949 through 1970 of
various people he represented. His clients have included Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg, executed for giving atomic bomb secrets to the
Soviet Union, and members of the so-called Chicago Seven, who were
accused of conspiring to incite a riot at the Democratic National
Convention in 1968.
   Government officials said the wiretaps, installed without court
warrants, were designed to protect national security. The government
said the eavesdropping was not aimed at Kinoy, who teaches law at
Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J.
   Kinoy's suit was filed in 1970, and eight years of pre-trial
maneuvering ensued. The case was dormant from 1979 until 1985 when
Kinoy sought to revive it, claiming the government violated the
confidentiality of the lawyer-client relationship.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last July threw out the
suit.
   ``Kinoy, as an attorney, possessed no constitutional right,
independent of his clients' rights, to communicate with his clients
without government intrusion when national security interests were
at stake,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court noted that Kinoy previously won a court order
barring the government from any future surveillance that would
violate his privacy rights.
   But the 2nd Circuit court said there is no ground for Kinoy to
collect damages from the government or from FBI officials who
authorized or conducted the eavesdropping.
   The case is Kinoy vs. Tolson, 88-892.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Bank Robbery Ruling in California Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling that
someone who plans a bank robbery but is arrested before actually
moving toward the bank may not be convicted of violating a federal
law prohibiting attempted bank robbery.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, rejected a Justice
Department appeal that sought reinstatement of an attempted bank
robbery conviction in a California case.
   Justices Byron R. White and Harry A. Blackmun voted to hear
arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such review.
   The case stems from the arrest of Reginald Dean Still on Aug. 7,
1985, in Roseville, Calif.
   Responding to a tip from a passerby, police found Still sitting
in a van parked some 200 feet from the Security Pacific Bank.
   The van's motor was running when police arrived and Still put it
in reverse and drove off. Police caught up with him and arrested him.
   Police said he told them, ``You did a good job. You caught me
five minutes before I was going to rob a bank.''
   He said he confessed because of incriminating evidence inside the
van _ including a blond wig, a phony bomb and a note demanding money
that Still said he intended to present to a teller at a drive-up
window.
   Police said Still told them his confession was merely ``frosting
on the cake'' because of the other evidence.
   He was convicted in federal court of attempted bank robbery and
interstate transporation of a stolen vehicle _ the van he said he
intended to use in the robbery. Still was sentenced to 15 years in
prison.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the stolen van
conviction but threw out the conviction for attempted bank robbery.
   ``Still's intent to rob the Security Pacific National Bank was
clearly established,'' the appeals court said.
   But the ``facts do not establish either actual movement toward
the bank or actions that are analytically similar to such
movement,'' the appeals court said. Without that, there can be no
conviction for attempted bank robbery, it added.
   Justice Department lawyers said the appeals court ruling
establishes a dangerous precedent.
   ``Attempts are punished as a crime because of the great need to
stop offenses from occurring,'' department lawyers said.
   ``A robbery may be only moments away even though the robber has
not yet begun to assault the bank,'' they continued. ``Society
should be free to intervene in order not only to stop a crime from
coming to pass, but also to punish the defendant for putting
innocent parties at risk of the loss of their property, serious
injury or death.''
   The government's appeal said the 9th Circuit court ruling, which
is binding law in Arizona, Alaska, California, Hawaii, Idaho,
Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state, is in conflict with
other federal courts.
   FBI statistics show that in 1987 nearly half of all robberies of
federally insured financial institutions occurred in states within
the 9th Circuit, the government said.
   The case is U.S. vs. Still, 88-581.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Kemp's Talk Doesn't Match Bush's Budget</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 10 grafs new; pickup at pvs 4th graf, Bush's budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis told new Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp
today there is a ``yawning gap'' between his optimistic talk about
solving urban problems and President Bush's federal budget proposal.
   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, injected a reminder of
the 1988 presidential campaign with his remarks to Kemp during the
annual winter meeting of the National Governors' Association.
   The HUD secretary, who himself sought the Republican presidential
nomination last year, described his hopes for using tax incentives
and private enterprise to reinvigorate cities to a committee of the
association.
   When Kemp took questions from the governors, Dukakis said ``I
applaud'' Kemp's efforts and noted many of his proposals have
already been put to work by states and cities.
   But Dukakis then asked him to reconcile his enthusiastic talk
about solving problems of poverty, homelessness and housing with
Bush's budget, which would provide no new spending for subsidized
housing and would cut some federal money to states and cities.
   ``On the other hand, as I look over the president's budget, there
is a yawning gap between what you're saying and what's in there,''
Dukakis said.
   He pointed to Bush's proposal to further cut back the Community
Development Block Grant program, which Dukakis said governments use
as public capital to attract additional private investment in
housing and other development projects.
   ``The budget does need some reworking,'' Dukakis said.
   Kemp responded, ``I think the president, despite criticism to the
contrary, has evidenced a good faith effort to work with the
Congress.'' He said ``it's obligatory upon the Congress'' to work in
cooperation with the president on the budget.
   Kemp cited the restraints on the federal budget but pledged, ``I
can assure you that I am going to do everything I can to make sure
that there is adequate funding for those programs that work.''
   Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, declined an invitation to
meet with the governors. But they heard a frank assessment Sunday
from the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Sen. James Sasser,
who warned, ``We're fresh out of cash here in Washington.''
   An Associated Press survey of governors before their arrival
found that most state executives respect Bush's ``no new taxes''
pledge and are holding off on calls for raising revenue to reduce
the federal deficit.
   Governors in both parties said that Bush's promise of a ``kinder,
gentler America'' suggested his administration will be more
receptive to state needs than was President Reagan, whose
administration dramatically reduced federal aid flowing to states.
   ``I think he's already shown himself more receptive to domestic
problems,'' said Republican Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, who
cited housing as the top domestic need.
   Michigan's Democratic Gov. James Blanchard said Bush ``has the
potential of being, from Michigan's point of view, a better
president than Ronald Reagan. Not necessarily more popular, but more
compassionate.''
   At the same time, however, governors voiced concern that Bush's
proposed federal budget for fiscal 1990 will bring another round of
domestic spending cuts that will require increased spending by the
states.
   ``We won't become a `kinder and gentler' nation until we address
our domestic needs, such as children at risk, the homeless and the
mentally ill,'' said Washington state's Democratic Gov. Booth
Gardner.
   Bush's 1988 Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, said he'd wait to see whether Bush follows through on
domestic needs.
   ``I hope so, but I'm very concerned about his budget, which is
looking for cuts of over $5 billion in Medicare and a number of
other areas which will have a devastating effect on health care and
important human needs,'' Dukakis said.
   Wyoming's Democratic Gov. Mike Sullivan gave Bush ``generally
good marks for at least establishing a kinder and gentler theme, a
desire to work cooperatively with the states.''
   The governors received a grim budget assessment from Sasser,
however, who said Bush's budget is based on overly optimistic
economic assumptions and leaves the tough decisions about where to
cut domestic spending up to Congress.
   ``The sad reality of our fiscal circumstances is that there's
substantial pain to be portioned out to the American people and I'm
sorry to say that the portion of that pain likely to fall to state
and local government is, once again, very substantial,'' said Sasser.
   He said that while Bush has asked for a line-item veto power over
the budget, a tool many governors have, ``he refuses to offer the
Congress this year a line-item budget.'' Bush's budget proposal
calls for spending limits without specifying many of the cuts that
will be needed to accomplish the goals.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, voiced concern that
Bush's budget proposal has no money for the $800 million job
training program that was part of the welfare reform pushed by the
governors and enacted by Congress.
   Blanchard said the states are hard-pressed to deal with new
obligations mandated by the federal government, such as for expanded
Medicaid coverage, without money to pay for them.
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger spoke to the governors
and cautioned against high expectations of expanded trade with the
Soviet Union.
   To Iowa's Gov. Terry Branstad, who asked about the prospects of
increased trade with the Soviets, Kissinger said, ``I don't think
it's going to stimulate the economy of your state during your term
of office.''
   The governors' association executive committee approved
resolutions putting the governors on record in support of
self-determination for Puerto Rico, uniform poll closing times
across the country, and easier voter registration.
   But a deficit-reduction plan that could have called for higher
taxes under certain circumstances was withheld from a vote when what
appeared to be a bipartisan consensus fell apart.
   The co-chairmen of the governors' task force that worked on the
plan, Democrat Mario Cuomo of New York and Republican Carroll
Campbell of South Carolina, backed off late last week after Cuomo
said it would incorporate a federal tax increase. Campbell said
through spokesman Tucker Eskew that he wanted to strike language
calling for higher taxes even ``in a doomsday scenario.''

<HEAD>Court Will Use Virgin Islands Case to Decide Evidence Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to use a case
from the U.S. Virgin Islands to decide whether federal juries may be
told about a defendant's alleged prior criminal conduct if a
previous trial on those charges ended in acquittal.
   The justices said they will review the bank robbery conviction
and 70-year prison sentence of Reuben Dowling.
   Federal prosecutors said Dowling used a ski mask and a pistol to
rob $7,000 from the First Pennsylvania Bank in Frederiksted, St.
Croix, on July 8, 1985.
   At his trial, prosecutors introduced evidence of Dowling's
alleged robbery of a private home weeks after the bank robbery
occurred. Dowling previously had been tried and acquitted of charges
stemming from the residential robbery.
   A federal trial judge allowed prosecutors to introduce such
evidence, and the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling.
   The appeals court said the evidence should not have been admitted
but its use was ``harmless'' _ meaning that Dowling would have been
convicted even if it had not been used.
   In the appeal acted on today, Dowling argued that telling jurors
about a crime for which he was acquitted violated his constitutional
rights and should not have been ruled harmless error.
   Justice Department lawyers argued that the evidence should not
have been ruled inadmissible. They said that although six federal
appeals courts have barred such evidence, three federal appeals
courts have allowed it.
   The case is Dowling vs. U.S., 88-6025.

<TEXT>
   The ice patrol ship Endurance today rescued 65
scientists and sailors from a Peruvian ocean research vessel that
ran aground in an Antarctic storm, the Defense Ministry said.
   The 1,980-ton Humboldt was taking on water after hitting rocks
Sunday night off King George Island, about 500 miles south of the
tip of South America, the ministry said.
   Endurance, which recently underwent emergency repairs after an
iceberg knocked a hole in its hull, went to the rescue, the ministry
said.
   Seamen from the Endurance and the repair ship Stena Seaspread
were put aboard the stricken vessel, but the Humboldt's crew was
evacuated as conditions rapidly worsened.
   The Endurance was taking the Peruvians to Marsh Base, a Chilean
station in Antarctica, the ministry said.
   The Stena Seaspread would stand by the Humboldt for two or three
days to monitor pollution and assist in any salvage work, the
ministry said.
   The Chilean navy said in a communique that its search and rescue
center was put on alert and that no oil spill has occurred. The
1,980-ton Humboldt is listing slightly and was in no immediate
danger of sinking, the Chilean communique said.
   The site is about 300 miles from the area where the Argentine
ship Bahia Paraiso ran aground and sank Jan. 28, spilling fuel oil.
The spill was cleaned up by ships from the United States, Chile and
Argentina. Damage to the environment is being evaluated by experts.

<HEAD>US, State of Washington Reach Accord on Nuclear Reservation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington state and the federal government
have reached an agreement over cleaning up the Hanford nuclear
reservation, which has become the most contaminated of the nation's
nuclear weapons production facilities.
   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner and officials of the Department of
Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency were signing the
accord in a ceremony at the Capitol today.
   According to a draft summary of the 300-page ``Hanford Action
Cleanup Action Plan'' circulated on Capitol Hill:
   _$2.8 billion will needed over the next five years to begin the
cleanup effort. That is roughly twice what would be available under
current budget guidelines that limit funding growth to 3 percent.
   _Specific milestones will be included for actually cleaning up
the reservation, including an accelerated schedule for removing
pumpable liquids from 149 aging, single-shell underground tanks and
constructing a vitrification plant to turn the wastes into a
glass-like substance.
   _The Justice Department has decided that the agreement will be
enforceable, an issue that had been a key sticking point in
negotiations.
   In addition, the federal government has agreed to provide
Washington $2.9 million over the next three years to fund the
state's oversight role.
   If the needed congressional funding is provided and the agreement
is carried forward, the clean-up effort could add 2,000 people to
the Hanford payroll by 1994.
   The agreement was reached after more than a year of negotiations
and amid threats that the state would seek a ``consent decree'' in
court if negotiations failed.
   Besides being the most contaminated of the Energy Department's 16
weapons-productions sites, the 570-square mile reservation in
south-central Washington is expected to be the most costly and
longest to clean up.
   The Energy Department estimated in January that it could cost up
to $57 billion to manage and clean up the radioactive and toxic
wastes at the reservation and even then Hanford wouldn't be returned
to a ``pristine'' condition.
   Stored at Hanford is more than 60 percent of the nation's
high-level radioactive waste generated by weapons programs dating
back to World War II.
   According to some estimates, more than 200 billion gallons of
liquid radioactive waste have been dumped directly into the soil at
Hanford and roughly 1,200 sites are seriously contaminated.
   There have also been concerns that the contaminated liquids may
be seeping into the groundwater deep beneath the reservation and
could eventually reach the nearby Columbia River.
   Scientists at the reservation worked on the atomic bomb that was
dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, at the end of World War II. Hanford was
one of the largest weapon's production complexes in the 1950s.
   At present, only one commercial nuclear power plant is operating
at the reservation and the Energy Department has announced plans to
phase out all weapons production activities at the site.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Jury-Makeup Issue in Illinois Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether the rights of white criminal defendants may be violated when
blacks are excluded from serving as jurors in their trials.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Daniel Holland, a
Chicago-area white man sentenced to 85 years in prison for rape,
kidnaping and armed robbery.
   The high court in 1986 ruled that prosecutors never may
disqualify potential jurors based on their race. The ruling
dramatically curtailed the traditonally broad power of prosecutors
to eliminate prospective jurors from trials by using peremptory, or
automatic, challenges.
   But that case involved a black defendant and jurors of his race.
The justices have not decided whether exclusion of black jurors in
this manner can violate the rights of a white defendant.
   In Holland's case, two blacks among the more than 30 prospective
jurors were excluded by the prosecution from serving on the panel
that eventually convicted him.
   Prosecutors said they were not motivated by racial considerations
when they used their peremptory challenges to exclude the two
blacks, a man and a woman, from the jury.
   The Illinois Supreme Court said that as a white person Holland
lacked legal standing to raise the issue of whether race played a
part in the exclusion of the two blacks.
   ``We decline to address this issue because we find that the
defendant, a Caucasian, does not have standing to assert (such a
constitutional) violation,'' the state court said.
   The state court also rejected Holland's argument that he was
denied his constitutional right to be tried by a fair cross-section
of the community.
   Holland was convicted in the rape and kidnaping of a Des Plaines,
Ill., teen-age girl on May 4, 1980.
   Prosecutors said Holland gave a ride to the girl and her
boyfriend. They said he forced the boyfriend to leave the car and
raped the girl at knifepoint.
   Holland was arrested hours after the assault when a police
stopped his car because it had no rear license plate.
   The case is Holland vs. Illinois, 88-5050.

<HEAD>Court Will Look at Limits on Sexually Oriented Businesses in Dallas
Case</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today agreed to take a fresh
look at how far cities may go to limit sexually oriented businesses.
   The court will study a Dallas zoning and licensing ordinance
challenged by owners of adult bookstores, motion picture theaters,
nightclubs, motels and nude-model studios.
   The challengers say the law violates their freedom of expression.
   Last week, the high court ruled in an Indiana case that states
may use anti-racketeering laws to crack down on pornography. But in
that case the court also ruled that businesses dealing with sexually
explicit materials may not be shut down before a judicial
determination that at least some of the materials are obscene.
   The 1986 Dallas ordinance requires that sexually oriented
businesses be at least 1,000 feet apart and at least 1,000 feet from
any church, school, residential area or park.
   Any existing business in violation of the regulation has three
years to move or shut down.
   The businesses also are required to obtain a license issued by
the chief of police, and must permit inspection of their premises
during operating hours.
   Also, the ordinance bars anyone convicted of a variety of crimes,
such as promotion of prostitution, from operating a sexually
oriented business. And it requires that viewing rooms in adult
theaters be open to permit surveillance by management.
   The regulations also bar motel owners from renting rooms for less
than 10 hours, a provision designed to discourage prostitution.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last February that
the ordinance is a legitimate attack on crime, urban blight and
declining property values.
   The appeals court noted that the Supreme Court in 1986 upheld a
somewhat similar ordinance in Renton, Wash., restricting the
location of adult theaters.
   Operators of adult entertainment outlets in Dallas said the
regulations in the Texas city are much stricter. They said dozens of
businesses will be forced to shut down because at least 106
establishments must relocate and there are only 50 available
locations.
   But the 5th Circuit court said the Dallas ordinance does not
violate free speech or other rights protected by the Constitution.
   The city council's ``consideration of the criminal effects of
concentrated sexually oriented businesses was thorough, as was its
review of the effects such concentrations have on property values,''
the appeals court said. ``In short, Dallas has demonstrated that the
ordinance furthers a substantial government interest.''
   The appeals court also said the city demonstrated ``a compelling
justification'' for its licensing requirements even though a
less-strict standard would be adequate to uphold the regulations.
   For example, ``The city need only show that (a criminal)
conviction and the evil to be regulated bear a substantial
relationship,'' the appeals court said.
   It added that the discretion given the police chief under the
ordinance to issue, suspend and revoke licenses is not impermissibly
broad.
   The appeals court also rejected arguments that the city ordinance
violates privacy rights by insisting that establishments offering
sexually oriented entertainment be open to inspection by authorities
without search warrants.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Agreed to decide whether the rights of white criminal
defendants may be violated when blacks are excluded from serving as
jurors in their trials.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Daniel Holland, a
Chicago-area white man sentenced to 85 years in prison for rape,
kidnaping and armed robbery.
   _ Turned down a challenge to his conviction by Bernhard Goetz,
who in 1984 shot four young men he said were going to rob him on a
New York City subway.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that Goetz weas
denied a fair trial. Goetz, who was sentenced to a year in jail and
fined $5,000, began his imprisonment at the Rikers Island jail in
New York City last month. He is eligible for, but not assured of,
parole after 51 days.
   _ Refused to revive an affirmative action program in South Bend,
Ind., that called for hiring more blacks and Hispanics as
firefighters and police officers.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck down
the plan after it was challenged by a white man denied a job as a
firefighter.
   _ Rejected ``reverse discrimination'' arguments by a white
Vallejo, Calif., firefighter denied a promotion that went to a black
man with a slightly lower test score.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that upheld the
black man's promotion to help achieve better racial balance within
the fire department.
   _ Let stand a ruling that someone who plans a bank robbery but is
arrested before actually moving toward the bank may not be convicted
of violating a federal law prohibiting attempted bank robbery.
   The court, over two dissenting votes, rejected a Justice
Department appeal that sought reinstatement of an attempted bank
robbery conviction in a California case.
   _ Turned down appeals by former Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and
former Brooklyn, N.Y., Democratic boss Meade Esposito aimed at
overturning their convictions for exchanging illegal gratuities.
   The court, without comment, cleared the way for Biaggi's
imprisonment on a 2{-year term. Esposito was sentenced to two years
probation and 500 hours of community service.
   The cases involving sexually oriented businesses are FW@PBS Inc.
vs. Dallas, 87-2012; MJR Inc. vs. Dallas, 87-2051; and Berry vs.
Dallas, 88-49.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today pledged continued
troop support for South Korea and called for lower trade barriers as
he wrapped up a five-day Asian trip and headed home to a fierce
political battle over John Tower's nomination to head the Pentagon.
   ``I have come here today as the leader of a faithful friend and a
dependable ally,'' Bush said in a speech to the South Korean
National Assembly that highlighted his quick stopover in Seoul. The
president boarded Air Force One at 5:24 p.m. local time (3:24 a.m.
EST) for the nearly 15-hour return trip to Washington. He made a
brief stop in Alaska for refueling just before noon EST.
   The president's audience applauded when he pledged to keep the
42,000 U.S. troops on duty as protection against North Korea, but
sat quietly when he talked of trade.
   ``I want you to have this direct from me: if we are to keep our
bilateral relationships growing even stronger, much more needs to be
done'' to ease trading relations, said the president.
   Although Bush's South Korean visit was limited to five hours, a
security force of 120,000 police, agents and commandos was put on
top alert to protect him against threats ranging from radical
students to North Korean infiltrators.
   About 700 radical students shouting ``Bush go home!'' battled
riot police with firebombs and rocks during a 45-minute clash around
Dongguk University in an abortive attempt to march on the U.S.
Embassy about three miles away.
   Earlier, police arrested about 15 prominent dissidents shouting
``no Bush visit'' who had tried to assemble about a block from the
embassy in downtown Seoul.
   Minutes after they were hauled away, Bush's helicopter flew
overhead on its way to the Blue House, the nearby presidential
mansion, after his arrival from China at a secure military base
outside Seoul. Police also clashed with demonstrators in five other
cities, including the site of a U.S. air base south of Seoul.
   From Seoul, Bush was flying back to Washington and the sternest
political test so far of his young administration, the storm over
the Tower nomination. The appointment is in danger of rejection in
the Democratic-controlled Senate, and the president has pledged to
mount a personal lobbying campaign to salvage it.
   Bush's brief visit in Seoul included a luncheon for which the
participants took off shoes and donned slippers. Guests sat on a
heated floor on cushions with hard backs. But the 6-foot-2 Bush had
trouble stretching his legs, asking his hosts, ``Do you put your
legs straight our or do you fold them up?''
   The president made his rounds of Seoul by helicopter as he met
with President Roh Tae-woo _ a democratically elected leader who
replaced the country's unpopular military dictatorship _ addressed
the South Korean National Assembly and greeted U.S. Embassy
employees.
   In the Blue House meeting, Bush and Roh held a 15-minute meeting
that included discussions on the trade issue. ``Korea has benefitted
from the United State's open market,'' Bush said in remarks to
reporters after the session.
   Roh voiced support for free markets throughout the world. He said
that both he and Bush had agreed to work to resolve ``various
problems resulting from the rapid expansion of economic relations
between our two countries.''
   Roh said he had briefed Bush on ``all our efforts for the
reduction of tension and consolidation of peace on the Korean
peninsula,'' including what he called ``a forward-looking policy
toward North Korea.''
   Bush traveled to South Korea from Beijing, and his final hours in
China were marred when authorities prevented the nation's top
dissident, Fang Lizhi, from attending a Sunday night banquet given
by the visiting president.
   The White House said Bush did not know of the incident at the
time, but on his departure today from Beijing, expressed regret to
Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian, according to White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Contradicting a statement he made a day earlier, Fitzwater also
said Bush did raise the issue of human rights problems ``privately''
in China.
   The president's visit in Seoul was intended to reaffirm the U.S.
commitment to Korean security while at the same time register
concern about barriers to American exports to Seoul, which has a
nearly $9 billion trade surplus with the United States.
   ``I know that there must be times when this body, just like the
United States Congress, is full of noise, contention and emotion,''
Bush said in his speech to the Assembly.
   ``But that is the sound of democracy at work and we wouldn't have
it any other way,'' he said.
   North Korea greeted Bush's trip to the South with a signed
commentary in Rodong Sinmun, the organ of the Central Committee of
the ruling Korean Workers' (Communist) Party, declaring that the vow
to keep U.S. troops in South Korea was ``a revelation of the U.S.
imperialists' unsatiated ambition for permanent occupation of South
Korea.'' The commentary was reported in a broadcast of the official
Korean Central News Agency that was monitored in Tokyo.
   Bush's trip came at a period of more public criticism of U.S.
policies than at any time in four decades. Radical students and
dissidents complain that the presence of 42,000 troops hinders
unification talks with the north.
   Farmers and businessmen charge that Washington is exerting undue
pressure to liberalize Korean import rules.
   Pledging not to cut back on U.S. forces, Bush said they will
remain ``as long as they are needed and as long as we believe it is
in the interest of peace to keep them there.''
   He praised South Korea as ``a world-class economic power'' and
said ``your commitment to democracy is demonstrated daily in this
chamber.''
   Bush called the Korean economy an inspiration to developing
countries.
   Yet, he said, ``we also cannot overlook that your economic
success has created concerns'' in U.S.-Korean relations.
   ``For the American people and for the Korean people as well,
reducing our bilateral trade imbalance will be both a challenge and
an opportunity,'' the president said.
   ``The challenge will be to resist calls for protectionism; the
opportunity will be to expand the prosperity of both our countries.''
   Bush said the American people ``share your goal of peaceful
unification'' with the north ``on terms acceptable to the Korean
people. It is for that reason that we actively support the peaceful
initiatives of President Roh to build bridges to the north.''
   On the eve of the visit in Seoul, Bush's national security
adviser, Brent Scowcroft, acknowledged that, ``There's been a lot of
unrest'' in Korea.
   ``There's been an anti-American tone to some of it. One of the
reasons the president's going there is to reassure the South Koreans
of our support for their moves toward democracy and of the firmness
of our strategic relationship.
   Asked if Seoul was moving fast enough on human rights
improvements, Scowcroft said, ``I think they're moving _ you know,
fast enough? That's a very value judgment. I think they're moving.
Koreans have gone a long way from where they were a short time ago.
I think we need to be patient as they feel their way through toward
a mature democratic system.''

   Rescue workers today found bodies of
three more victims of storms that churned up 80 mph winds and killed
23 people across Europe's western seaboard and Mediterranean coast,
officials said.
   Sunday's storms from Britain to Spain sank or disabled eight
ships with waves as high as 30 feet. Rescue workers said 26 people
remain missing and presumed dead today. At least 80 people were
rescued.
   Calmer weather returned to Portugal today, but storms continued
to lash northern Spain, western France and Britain.
   Antonio Loureiro, an official of the National Meteorological
Institute in Lisbon, said winds had died down to as little as 6 mph.
   The Spanish Meteorological office issued storm warnings for
extensive areas of the Mediterranean and North Atlantic coasts.
Winds could gust up to 50 mph in northwestern Cape Finisterre, said
the institute.
   Mediterranean waves washed over dikes along the French Riviera on
Sunday, inundating seaside restaurants at Cannes and washing over
the Promenade des Anglais at Nice.
   French police reported a 62-year-old man was killed when a big
wave knocked him against a wall, a nurse was caught by a 25-foot
wave and drowned and another woman's body was recovered from the
sea. There was a fourth death in France, on Saturday, when a young
man was carried away by high waves and drowned.
   Storms killed 12 people Saturday and Sunday in Spain, where
strong winds knocked over billboards and blew off parts of roofs.
They included, five deaths in the eastern city of Valencia, three
died in central Valladolid and Chinchilla towns, and another person
in eastern Aguilas, Spanish National Radio reported. A man drowned
when his canoe overturned in northern Spain. The last two victims,
whose bodies have not been recovered, are a crewmen missing from a
Spanish fishing trawler and a Swedish tourist reported missing
Saturday from the beach on Balearic Island of Majorca, where she was
swimming.
   In the most serious incident, a Nigerian cargo ship with 46
people aboard developed engine trouble two miles off Cape Espichel,
a rocky promontory of Portugal. Gale-force winds and 16-foot waves
drove the 3,000-ton River Gurara onto the rocks and broke the ship
in two, a spokesman for the Portuguese navy said.
   A Portuguese frigate picked up 27 people from lifeboats, he said.
   The navy said three more bodies were found today, bringing to
seven the number of bodies recovered.
   ``It is almost impossible there are any more survivors,'' said
Cmdr. Carlos Fidalgo.
   Off Bordeaux, France, a Singapore-registered freighter issued a
distress call and sank Saturday, and rescue workers searched
fruitlessly Sunday for 14 sailors who were aboard.
   A Bulgarian cargo ship also caught fire off Lisbon, and four
people were injured, officials said.

   Yugoslavia's presidency imposed
``special measures'' in the southern province of Kosovo today as
military vehicles moved toward a mine where 1,300 workers remained
underground on strike.
   Meanwhile, one of the miners' primary demands was met when the
province's Communist Party leader, Rahman Morina, resigned, the
Yugolsav news agency Tanjug reported.
   There was no immediate response from the strikers, who had been
holed up for eight days in the Trepca lead and zinc mines in Titova
Mitrovica.
   Military planes twice flew over Pristina, Kosovo's capital, and
armed vehicles were seen heading toward Titova Mitrovica.
   Tanjug said ``the presidency of Yugoslavia today ordered that
special measures be introduced in Kosovo for protecting the
constitutional order.''
   ``The implementation of these measures was effective immediately.
The public has not yet been informed of the precise measures
involved.''
   The agency did not give further details on the ``special
measures.''
   The announcement came after Tanjug reported the miners said they
were cutting off outside contacts, except for medical assistance,
until Morina stepped down.
   He later resigned and Radio Belgrade quoted him as saying, ``I am
deeply shaken that you consider me responsible for your lives and
health. It is only for this purpose that I am submitting the
resignation.''
   But 800 miners from the Slav minority in Kosovo descended into
another lead and zinc mine today and said they would remain
underground if Morina stepped down.
   Like the majority of miners, Morina is an ethnic Albanian. But
the miners believe he is too supportive of Serbia, one of
Yugoslavia's six republics.
   Kosovo is part of Serbia but is actually an autonomous province.
The miners fear that proposals to change Yugoslavia's constitution
would increase Serbia's control of the province.
   Serbian leaders claim tighter control is necessary to protect the
Slav minority, which claims persecution by the ethnic Albanians.
   The ethnic Albanian miners also have demanded the resignations of
Husamedin Azemi, the Communist Party leader in Pristina, and Ali
Sukrija, a representative of Kosovo in the national party leadership.
   Azemi also resigned today, citing ``moral considerations and ...
blackmail.'' Sukrija can only submit his resignation to the federal
leadership in Belgrade.
   Earlier today, the Communist leadership of Yugoslavia appealed to
the miners to ``stop imperiling your health and lives'' and come out
of the mine, Tanjug reported.
   At least 550 exhausted miners have requested medical assistance,
the news agency said.
   On Saturday, the presidency _ a nine-man collective body that
commands Yugoslavia's armed forces _ ordered greater internal
security in Kosovo and extra police units were brought in.
   More police than usual patrolled Pristina streets today, and
soldiers guarded key buildings and army barracks. Police roadblocks
were seen on some roads leading into Kosovo, travelers reported.
   Riza Muslimi, a spokesman for the strikers, said Saturday that
they had stashed two tons of explosives underground. He refused to
say if they planned to blow up the mining complex if their demands,
which include management changes at the mine, weren't met.
   Yugoslavia's economy has deteriorated since 1980 and the nation's
standard of living has been in steep decline.
   The jobless rate last year was 15 percent, and citizens staged
huged demonstrations calling for changes in the nation's leadership.

   Federal prosecutors were preparing to tell a
bloody tale of restaurant rubouts, a ``contract'' to assassinate
reputed mob boss John Gotti and Mafia control of construction as the
trial of six alleged organized crime figures opened today.
   Jury selection began today, and opening arguments were scheduled
to start next week. U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry granted
the government's request for an anonymous jury _ a first for a
federal trial in New Jersey _ because of the nature of the case.
   The trial is expected to shed light on organized crime violence
in the New York metropolitan area, and may help solve a string of
mob-related murders dating back 12 years.
   It also will mark the courtroom debut of Vincent ``Fish'' Cafaro
as a prosecution witness.
   Cafaro is a former associate of jailed and aging former Genovese
boss Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Salerno. He testified last year before
Congress about life in the mob and its activities.
   Ms. Barry said the case ``makes no pretense of being other than
an organized crime case in which the inner workings of the Mafia
will be hammered home.''
   The main defendants, indicted in June, are reputed Genovese
``consigliere,'' or No. 3 leader, Louis A. ``Bobby'' Manna, 59; his
deputy, restaurant owner Martin ``Motts'' Casella, 71; and Richard
``Bocci'' DeSciscio, 42, termed an enforcer for the group. The three
are being held without bail.
   They and the other defendants _ Rocco J. Napoli, 42, John
Derrico, 27, and Frank ``Dipsy'' Daniello, 67, _ are charged with
racketeering.
   The racketeering charge includes allegations of controlling labor
unions, extorting construction industry figures, trafficking in
stolen goods, loan sharking, illegal gambling, murder and murder
conspiracy. All deny the charges and organized crime ties.
   Much of the government's case rests on 2,500 hours of taped
conversations recorded in a back room of a Hoboken restaurant from
June 1987 to March 1988.
   Prosecutors said they will present evidence about a plot to kill
Gotti, the flamboyant reputed boss of the Gambino crime family in
New York City. Authorities have said the Genovese family was angry
about Gambino incursions in northern New Jersey territory.

   Five Kurdish guerrillas and a Turkish
policeman died in a shoot-out in this southeastern township Monday,
the Anatolia News Agency reported.
   It occurred when security forces called on the rebels to
surrender and they instead opened fire, the agency said.
   The guerrillas are thought to belong to the outlawed Kurdish
Labor Party, which wants to set up a Marxist state for ethnic Kurds
in parts of eastern and southeastern Turkey.
   An estimated 800 civilians and security personnel and an equal
number of insurgents have been killed since the rebels started
hit-and-run attacks in 1984, official reports say.
   About a fifth of Turkey's 55 million people are Kurds.

<HEAD>Red Cross to Reopen Artificial Limb Center in Kabul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said
Monday it is sending experts back to Kabul this week to reopen an
artificial limb center in the capital of Afghanistan.
   The center was closed at the start of February when the committee
recalled half its 40 delegates because of tension as Soviet troops
completed their withdrawal, said spokesman Juerg Bischoff.
   Two orthopedic experts, both envoys of the all-Swiss
organization, are to return to Kabul this week to reopen a center
that provides artificial limbs to mine victims. About 20,000
survivors of mine explosions in Afghanistan need artificial limbs,
the committee estimated.
   More of the delegates may return if they are needed, Bischoff
said.
   ``The tension has subsided,'' he said. ``Around Feb. 15 (the
deadline for the Soviet withdrawal), nobody knew what would happen.
In the event, not so much happened.''
   Twenty Red Cross delegates have remained in Kabul, running a
hospital, Bischoff said.

   Information exchanged by 20 law enforcement
officers familiar with serial killer Ted Bundy will be analyzed
further to see if other crimes can be linked to him, the FBI said
today.
   ``Information exchanged at the conference will be used to build a
model of homicides typically committed by Ted Bundy,'' the FBI said
in a statement after a weeklong meeting of Bundy investigators
ended. ``This model will be compared against crimes that are
unsolved in which he remains a suspect.
   Bundy was executed Jan. 24 in Florida for the 1978 murder of
Kimberly Diane Leach of Lake City, Fla.
   In the days before his death, Bundy confessed to 23 killings
across the West, although he did not provide 23 names, and also gave
information that authorities said might linke him to other cases. He
had been convicted of three killings in Florida.
   Some investigators believe the onetime law student who became
America's most notorious serial killer have slain more than 100
women as far back as two decades ago.
   The FBI said the goal of the conference was to determine the
scope of Bundy's activities.
   ``A chronological listing of his travels and activities will be
charted by the FBI Visual Investigative Analysis Unit,'' the FBI
statement said. ``This process will consist of a detailed
examination of police records from around the country.''
   FBI Special Agent William Hagmaier, who was present with Bundy at
all of his interviews with investigators and was the last law
enforcement official to speak with the serial killer, said he
believed conference participants came away with some useful
information.
   ``Some people were brought in who had not had an opportunity to
take confessions but were familiar with his crime scenes,'' Hagmaier
said. ``We're discussing his methods of operation and his
whereabouts in various cases to determine the practicality of
considering him a suspect.''

<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said Monday
three of his aides had bought bargain shares in the company at the
center of a stock-profiteering scandal, but he denied any personal
involvement in the affair.
   ``I regret my aides' purchase of shares occurred because of my
poor supervision,'' Nakasone said in a nationally televised news
conference. ``But I am innocent and played no role in the scandal.''
   The largest opposition party, the Socialists, expressed
dissatisfaction with Nakasone's remarks, and repeated demands the
government summon him to testify before Parliament concerning the
scandal.
   ``If we can't get a satisfactory response from the government, we
are ready to boycott the remaining Parliament session. I believe
other opposition parties are ready to follow our line, too,'' said
Osamu Yatabe, a Socialist member of Parliament.
   The scandal involves sales to 150 influential politicians and
businessmen of bargain-priced shares in Recruit-Cosmos Co. before
the stock was listed for public sale. When public trading began, the
share prices shot up and the bargain buyers profited handsomely.
   The scandal has shaken the government, and prosecutors have
arrested eight people on charges of bribery or violating securities
laws.
   Nakasone, who was prime minister in 1982-87, denied his
involvement in the scandal for the first time in an interview last
week with CBS News.
   Monday's news conference marked his first public comments to the
Japanese on the affair. It also was the first time Nakasone publicly
acknowledged that his aides bought shares in Recruit-Cosmos, a
subsidiary of the information service conglomerate Recruit Co.
   He said the aides bought a total of 29,000 shares in September
1986 and sold them the following month. He did not say how much
profit they made.
   Asked Monday if he would appear before Parliament, Nakasone said:
``I don't believe it is necessary now that I have made everything
clear today, but I would follow the government's decision.''
   He said he was to travel to the United States on Tuesday to give
lectures at several universities.
   Yatabe said the Socialist Party would press the government to
summon Nakasone, along with Hisashi Shinto, former chairman of
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., and Ihei Aoki, former secretary
to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   Opposition parties say they suspect Nakasone directed the giant
telephone utility to buy two supercomputers from a U.S. manufacturer
and sell them to Recruit Co. The tranaction reportedly benefited
Recruit significantly.
   Two former Nippon Telegraph vice presidents are among those who
have been arrested in the scandal.
   More than 20 prominent people, including former Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa and two other Cabinet ministers, have resigned
because of links to the affair.

   A moderate earthquake rattled south-central
Utah today, and seismologists said the temblor was an unusual late
aftershock of a larger quake that struck the same area a month
earlier.
   The University of Utah Seismograph Stations reported the quake
measured 4.2 on the Richter scale and was centered 16 miles
southeast of Salina in a remote, mountainous area of the Sevier
Plateau.
   It caused no apparent damages or injuries, but was felt by
residents in Sevier, Emery and Sanpete counties, said senior staff
seismologist Sue Nava.
   A quake of magnitude 5.4 that struck Jan. 29 was located in the
same precise spot, Nava said. Today's temblor was an aftershock of
the larger quake, which caused minor damage and was reported felt
throughout Utah and parts of Wyoming, Colorado and Arizona.
   ``It is somewhat unusual, but certainly possible'' for an
aftershock to occur a month later, Nava said. The latest quake also
occurred deeper than most, rumbling about 15 miles underground, she
added.
   Since the January quake there have been about 50 aftershocks
along the Sevier Plateau, but most were too small to be felt, she
said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate damage
in the local area.

   John Tower's pledge to swear off alcohol if
approved as defense secretary left two undecided Senate Democrats
unmoved today and pledging they will go over all evidence on the
nominee's character before deciding how to vote.
   A third Democratic senator considered by some a swing vote, Bob
Graham of Florida, said he is leaning against the nomination despite
Tower's pledge.
   ``I think it (the pledge) helps, but it's not just the drinking
which is a problem to me,'' Graham said in Miami.
   ``It's a pattern of bad judgment _ bad judgment in the 1970s in
drinking, bad judgment by placing himself in compromising positions
as the U.S. arms negotiator in Geneva in the mid-80s, bad judgment
in accepting large sums from the defense industry in the late
1980s.''
   Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama, one of several Southern Democrats
still considered open to the White House lobbying effort for Tower,
said on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' that he has ``to review all
the evidence. I'm trying to be open-minded, judicial and fair about
it.''
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said on the ABC program that he would
vote against Tower if the vote were today despite the embattled
nominee's extraordinary pledge on Sunday.
   ``I think that if we have a serious doubt, if any senator has a
serious doubt about the competence of a candidate, that he should
err on the side of safety,'' said Breaux. ``In that case, it
indicates voting negatively.''
   Asked whether Tower's promise to refrain from drinking had swayed
him, Heflin said he plans to read the classified FBI report on Tower
today and ``will review the evidence of the drinking problem.''
   Heflin said he will consider ``does he have a drinking problem
that might be a detriment to the United States national security''
and ``does he have a temptation propensity that might return to
drink.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said on CBS ``This Morning,''
meanwhile, that Tower's vow should put the drinking questions to
rest ``because John Tower is a man of his word. ... So I think that
particular issue ought to be gone.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, held a
late-morning meeting on the Tower nomination with Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan. Neither would comment afterward.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said he would have no comment on Tower's
pledge. The senator said he would be ``meeting with colleagues off
and on during the day.''
   Warner planned to meet with President Bush on Tuesday to discuss
the nomination.
   Tower made his pledge against the alcohol in televised interviews
Sunday, saying he would be ``obliged to resign'' if he broke the vow.
   At the same time, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said he might reconvene
Armed Services Committee confirmation hearings to hear testimony in
public about the former Texas senator's drinking habits.
   The committee chairman coupled his statement with a complaint
that the White House was leaking information from the FBI's
background report on Tower in a bid to rescue the nomination.
   Nunn also expressed concern about Tower's ties to defense
consultants and the appearance of conflict of interest. Over a
two-year period, Tower received more than $1 million in consulting
fees from such industry giants as Rockwell and Martin Marietta.
   The Georgia senator, in the NBC interview, noted that Tower
served as a U.S. arms control negotiator in Geneva and then advised
defense companies on arms control efforts on the weapons they build.
   ``It's a tough line to draw,'' Nunn said. ``But I do believe that
John Tower crossed that line.''
   Nunn's Democratic-controlled committee voted 11-9 along party
lines last Thursday to recommend that the full Senate reject Tower's
nomination, with the chairman citing allegations of excessive
drinking by the nominee.
   The comments today and Sunday were a prelude to an intense week
of political maneuvering over the nomination, which the full Senate
is expected to debate beginning at midweek.
   President Bush intends to take personal charge of the lobbying
campaign for Tower, and has invited several Democrats to the White
House to discuss the issue later in the week.
   But Tower wasn't waiting for Bush to return home from his Asian
trip.
   ``Noting the principal concern of Senator Nunn and other members
of the Senate relative to my confirmation as secretary of defense,
namely the extent to which I may engage in excessive use of beverage
alcohol, let me state that I have never been an alcoholic nor
dependent on alcohol,'' Tower said in a statement he read on
ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley'' and Cable News Network's
``Newsmaker Sunday.''
   ``I hearby swear and undertake that if confirmed, during the
course of my tenure as secretary of defense, I will not consume
beverage alcohol of any type or form, including wine, beer or
spirits of any kind,'' he said.
   Tower also vowed that if he broke his pledge not to drink, he
would step down. ``I think I'd be obliged to resign if I broke the
pledge. I've never broken a pledge in my life,'' said the former
senator.
   Dole called Tower's pledge ``very, very significant'' and urged
Democrats and Republicans to reassess the nomination.
   ``My view is it ought to be a new ball game. We ought to sit down
and try to work it out and spare any hard feelings,'' Dole said.
   Mitchell said Tower's pledge ``is another factor to be
considered.''
   Nunn had no comment on Tower's pledge, according to Arnold
Punaro, a member of the Armed Services Committee staff.
   President Bush begins courting undecided Democrats on Tuesday in
hopes of capturing enough votes for Tower to win confirmation.
Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, meaning Bush must
pick up at least five Democrats to assure Tower's confirmation.
   Tower, in the interviews, also read from a letter from his doctor
saying tests last month found that he had normal liver functions and
there was no evidence of alcohol impairment or alcoholism.
   In the interview with CNN, Tower acknowledged that he was a heavy
drinker during the 1970s but denied that he had a drinking problem.
``Drank to excess. I wouldn't say that I had a problem. That is to
say, I wasn't hooked on it; I wasn't dependent on it. I did drink
too much,'' he said.
   On the ABC program, the onetime chairman of the Armed Services
Committee and former U.S. arms control negotiator conceded that
there was a point in his life when he changed his drinking habits.
   ``Twelve years ago, I gave up spirits. I used to be a pretty good
scotch drinker. I haven't tasted scotch in 12 years. After that I
had only wine, and perhaps an occasional martini, occasionally a
little vodka with smoked salmon, caviar, something like that. That
was just occasionally.
   ``I really essentially (have) been a wine drinker. Now my only
consumption is wine at meals.''
   Tower has been dogged by allegations of both excessive drinking
and womanizing.
   Pressed by interviewer Sam Donaldson about whether he would
pledge not to see women, the former senator asked the ABC newsman to
define womanizer in what became a heated exchange.
   ``Now, when allegations are raised that you're a womanizer,
should you take a pledge not to go out with women?'' Donaldson asked.
   ``I'm a single man. I do date women,'' said the twice-divorced
Tower.

<HEAD>Death Toll Triples Average in 1988 Earthquakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Earthquake deaths last year nearly tripled the
world's annual average, largely as a result of the tragic Armenian
tremor, the U.S. Geological Survey reported Monday.
   The year's loss of life in earth tremors was the worst in more
than a decade and occurred despite a decline in the total number of
significant earthquales reported during the year, Survey officials
reported.
   The exact number of deaths remains unknown, but is likely nearly
triple the average annual toll of about 10,000 fatalities worldwide.
   A year earlier, in 1987, only 1,100 lives had been lost in
earthquakes.
   The 1988 toll is the most since 1976 when at least 250,000 people
were killed in an earthquake in China.
   The Geological Survey said it is using a low estimate of 25,000
deaths in the Dec. 7 tremor in Armenia. That figure is the Soviet
government estimate. Some other reports have been much higher.
   The Armenian quake, with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale,
also injured 13,000 people and left more than a half-million
homeless.
   The main shock was followed within minutes by a second tremor,
measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale, which estimates the energy
released by a tremor. A quake of 5.0 can cause considerable damage,
and the strength rises by 10 times for each whole number on the
scale.
   Collapsing buildings were blamed for many of the deaths in
Armenia as the quake rattled concrete structures until they fell to
the ground, according to subsequent analyses.
   Another quake in the Soviet Union, claiming about 1,000 lives,
later struck in Soviet central Asia. That tremor occurred in
January, however, and so does not count in the 1988 toll.
   The second most deadly quake of 1988 came on Aug. 20, when about
1,000 people died as a result of a tremor on the Nepal-India border.
That quake measured 6.6 on the Richter scale. It destroyed thousands
of homes and injured many.
   On Nov. 6, a quake measuring 7.3 on the scale claimed 730 lives
and injured about 4,000 people on the border between Burma and
China, the Geological Survey reported.
   And on the India-Burma border three deaths were reported in an
Aug. 6 quake that caused landslides.
   The Survey said it recorded 61 significant quakes last year, 15
fewer than the year before. A quake is considered significant if it
has a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale. Tremors of lesser
magnitude are included if they cause casualties or considerable
damage.
   Three significant quakes were recorded in the United States last
year including the strongest shock of the year. That tremor,
measured at 7.6, occurred March 6 in the Gulf of Alaska and resulted
in only minor damage.
   The only U.S. earthquake death last year was a heart attack
following a quake measured at 4.8 in Whittier, Calif., in February.
The other significant U.S. quake occurred Dec. 3 in Pasadena, Calif.
It was measured at 4.6 on the scale but caused some injuries and
property damage.
   A quake centered in eastern Canada on Nov. 25 was felt widely
across that country and in the northeastern United States as far
south as Washington, the survey reported. It had a magnitude of 5.7.
Quakes in the eastern part of North America tend to be felt over
larger areas than tremors of similar strength in the West.
   Europe recorded three earthquake deaths last year when a tremor
rated at 3.0 killed a group of miners in Czechoslovakia on Sept. 2.
   In addition a tremor rated at 5.8 caused several injuries in
Albania on Jan. 9.
   Injuries were also reported from two offshore quakes, one in the
Ionian Sea near Greece Oct. 16 and another near the Azores Islands
Nov. 21.
   In Africa, eight persons working in a gold mine in South Africa
died Jan. 5 in an earthquake rated at 5.2.
   And Japan, usually very seismically active, recorded only one
significant quake last year, the Survey reported. That tremor
measured 5.4 and resulted in 10 injuries and minor damage in the
Tokyo area.

<HEAD>American Psychiatrists to Examine Soviet Mental Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of American psychiatrists is embarking on a
two-week review of Soviet psychiatry including interviews with two
dozen patients Western human rights activists suspect are being held
for political reasons.
   The Soviet Union says it has ended abuses and is interested in
rejoining the World Psychiatry Association, from which it withdrew
in 1983 under pressure from Western countries that accused it of
using psychiatry for political purposes.
   ``The purpose of our visit will be to assess, insofar as possible
and in a limited period of time, changes in Soviet policies, laws
and treatment practices in the field of forensic psychiatry,'' said
Robert W. Farrand, a U.S. State Department official leading the
20-member team.
   He described the visit, which ends March 12, as unprecedented.
   Soviet human rights activists said recently that 20-30 mentally
healthy people still are held in mental hospitals for political
reasons.
   Loren H. Roth, head of the Law and Psychiatry program at the
University of Pittsburgh and the medical leader, said the group
expects to interview 25-30 Soviets whose cases have been raised by
Western human rights campaigners.
   ``These are the patients whose cases are perhaps best known,'' he
said.
   Farrand told reporters Monday the Soviets are giving the group
access to all the patients whose cases they asked to review, but
delegation officials added there was no way they could ensure other
people unknown to human rights activists are not being held for
political reasons.
   Delegation members said they have been given medical records for
most of the patients, and expect to receive more before they begin
examinations.
   Patients will be given a choice of speaking only to the American
group, or to have a Soviet psychiatrist present as well, they said.
   The American group includes five psychiatrists who are former
Soviet citizens. They will conduct the interviews in Russian and
screen out any cultural bias in the examinations, the group said.
   Patients will be tested for any drugs that are being
administered, and the delegation has asked Soviet psychiatrists to
present the patients as they normally live.
   The group eventually will issue a report on its findings, but
won't identify the patients to protect their privacy.
   One official said the group planned to avoid publicity while in
the Soviet Union because ``the chemistry of this is very delicate.''
   It also will visit two psychiatric hospitals that human rights
activists say once held political prisoners and two that never have
been so identified.
   Delegation officials said the visits to the latter would allow
them to assess the general state of Soviet psychiatric care.
   Abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union has been a contentious
issue between the superpowers for decades.
   As part of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, some psychiatric
hospitals were transferred from police control to control by the
Health Ministry. A new law made it a crime to commit a sane person
to a mental hospital.
   Last month, Georgy Morozov, head of the Soviet psychiatric
society, said there were no more people held in psychiatric
hospitals for political reasons.
   Officials of the U.S. delegation said their investigation was not
directly aimed at Moscow's effort to be readmitted to the world
association, but that the issue was likely to come up when the
organization meets in October.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Confronts Ukrainian Old Guard, Inspires Reformers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
confrontation with the last Brezhnev man on the Politburo has
ignited rising local opposition to stubborn old guard of the Ukraine.
   ``For a long time, people's mouths were sewn shut,'' said Ivan
Drach, a writer who heads the Narodni Rykh, or People's Movement.
``Now people in many situations are seeking to speak out.''
   In a four-day campaign through the Soviet Union's second most
populous republic last week, Gorbachev ordered Ukrainian Communist
Party boss Vladimir Shcherbitsky and his political machine to start
backing perestroika.
   The Ukrainian government responded with a crackdown on
protesters, arresting human rights activists within hours of
Gorbachev's departure. On Sunday, paramilitary police shoved 6,000
people from a downtown square when speeches at a cultural rally
turned to politics.
   The Gorbachev showdown coincided with a Ukrainian reform movement
that in the last three months has shaken off 17 years of repression
under Shcherbitsky. The Narodni Rykh, formed in November but not
permitted to publish its program until 10 days ago, is one of
several new organizations in Kiev calling for change.
   The new Ukrainian Language Society on Jan. 27 persuaded the
republic's parliament to begin work on a law making Ukrainian the
official language, a society seeking to reveal the crimes of
dictator Josef Stalin is getting organized, and a Committee for
Democratic Elections is protesting the removal of certain candidates
from balloting for the new parliament.
   As Gorbachev's calls for modernization in the Ukraine dominated
Soviet TV news last week, Shcherbitsky was shown standing
stone-faced behind the Kremlin leader.
   ``We always had these ideas,'' said Boris Oliinyk, a reformer on
the Ukrainian Communist Party Central Committee. ``We just couldn't
work on them earlier.''
   Gorbachev called reform leaders into a meeting of Communist Party
officials and sided with the reformers. Shcherbitsky sat and
listened, two elated reformers said afterward.
   The Kremlin leader also ordered Ukrainian Communist Party leaders
to pay more attention to democratization, elected bodies and
rank-and-file party members. He told workers on the streets of Kiev
they should oust bosses who don't perform well.
   Reversing local authorities, Gorbachev also promised that a
controversial nuclear power plant wouldn't begin operations unless
declared safe by American experts.
   In setting Ukrainian activists free to push for change, Gorbachev
risks igniting nationalism. But his attempt to overhaul the nation's
economy cannot succeed without reform in the Ukraine _ the
industrial and agricultural heart of the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev himself brought up the danger of Ukrainian nationalism,
warning miners in Donetsk that the country could not afford ethnic
disturbances in a republic of 50 million people when strife in the
smaller republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan was so damaging.
   Drach said Gorbachev has allowed Shcherbitsky to remain in power
this long because of this ``fear of stirring up the Ukraine to the
boiling point.''
   As a result, the Ukraine has seen virtually no glasnost,
activists said. Crimes of Stalin being examined by a Politburo
commission and the national press are out of bounds for Ukrainian
newspapers. Demonstrations that have met little or no resistance in
Moscow and the Baltics have been broken up in the Ukraine, said Oles
Shevchenko, head of the local Helsinki Watch group.
   Economic innovations such as private cooperatives and leasing
have been rare, said writer Yuri Shcherbak. Environmental concerns
about radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion
have been ignored.
   Demonstrators in Kiev last week called for Shcherbitsky's defeat
in the upcoming election, although he is running unopposed.
   At the conclusion of Sunday's rally on the preservation of
ancient Kiev, paramilitary police stormed the square after human
rights activists announced their demonstrations had been canceled
since Gorbachev's departure because of the arrest of protest
organizers. Some in the crowd responded to the strong-armed tactics
of the police with anger, screaming, ``Nazis!''
   Shcherbak said the burgeoning populist movements have their roots
in public anger over the Chernobyl disaster. Government secrecy
about the resulting radiation sparked an environmental movement that
won permission to hold a meeting in November that drew an estimated
20,000 people.
   The meeting ended with calls to form the People's Movement,
modeled on the Popular Fronts in the Baltic states.
   ``Everyone wants to live better, to breathe more freely, to feel
himself a person, not a slave,'' Drach said.
   Where Ukrainians once were afraid to mention Shcherbitsky's name,
there now are open calls for his ouster.
   ``People lack faith in the old leaders, particularly
Shcherbitsky,'' Drach said.
   ``He is old, sick and he must go,'' said Shcherbak. ``I think he
will go soon. In the Ukraine, we very much need a leader.''
   The first signal of a potentially important change in the
Ukrainian Communist Party leadership since the 1982 death of Leonid
Brezhnev came in December when a Gorbachev man, Vladimir Ivashko,
was named Shcherbitsky's deputy.
   In the Baltics, Communists have joined the reform groups. But in
Kiev, the deputy director of the Helsinki Watch group, Anatoly
Nahirnyak, was expelled from the party last week, Shevchenko said.
   ``There are progressive people in the party,'' Shcherbak said,
``but they can't do anything yet.''
   Now, however, the reformers believe they have Gorbachev on their
side.
   ``Gorbachev himself said he needs people who won't run away from
difficult problems,'' Shcherbak said. Gorbachev made it clear, he
added, that if such people are found in the outside reform
organizations, they should be brought into the mainstream fight for
change.

<HEAD>Head of New Veterans Department Sees No Additional Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cabinet status for the Veterans Administration
does not automatically mean more money, the man designated to head
the new department told the nation's largest veterans group Monday.
   ``We realize that with the budget problems facing this
administration, we're not going to be the priority group,'' Edward
J. Derwinski told an American Legion meeting. ``We don't want any
false expectations, any false hopes in the field.''
   After his speech, Derwinski told reporters he does not believe he
will be able to win extra money for the new department in the
current fiscal year. It was his first such admission, though he
earlier had said he had not won over the Office of Management and
Budget to his view that the Veterans Administration needs more funds.
   A Legion spokesman said supplemental funds were essential this
year.
   The VA on March 15 becomes the Department of Veterans Affairs,
the government's newest and second-largest Cabinet department.
   Derwinski is scheduled to go before the Senate Veterans Affairs
Committee on Tuesday for a closed hearing that is expected to delve
into his admitted tipping off of the South Korean embassy in 1975
that a member of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency was about to
defect.
   On Monday, Derwinski began his speech with the warning, ``The
first thing we have to appreciate, and it isn't easy to accept, is
that there isn't an automatic pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
merely by being called a department,'' He returned to that theme
several times.
   Though Congress intended to enhance the influence of the agency
both inside and outside the administration through elevation to
Cabinet status, he said, ``it isn't something that is going to
happen overnight. It's going to take time, it's going to take
salesmanship, it's going to take special effort.''
   Speaking with reporters afterward, Derwinski said he was seeking
an extra $520 million for the 1990 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1,
almost all of it for medical care.
   ``If there is an '89 supplemental, which I doubt, we'll have a
shot there,'' he said.
   Veterans Administration officials have said since fall the $10.8
billion budgeted for medical care this year is $600 million to $1
billion short, and the veterans committees of both houses have urged
the administration to seek additional funds.
   Last week, the House Veterans Affairs Committee recommended to
the House Budget Committee additional spending this year of $520
million, 83 percent of it for medical care, and $1.3 billion more
for next year, 85 percent of it for medical care.
   Total spending by the Veterans Administration is budgeted at
$29.77 billion in the current year. President Bush proposed $29.96
billion for 1990, of which $10.99 billion would be for medical care.
   Jim Hanson, a spokesman for the American Legion, said when told
that Derwinski did not expect a supplemental appropriation in the
current fiscal year, ``I think we'd be terribly disappointed. It's
essential.''
   ``It's a terrifying thought that they'd start closing more beds''
in the 130 VA hospitals, Hanson said.
   Sparky Gierke of Bismarck, N.D., national commander of the
American Legion, exhorted Derwinski after the speech to be ``the
strong voice of the veterans, and carry the water of the American
veteran and not that of the Office of Management and Budget.''

   Federal agents apprehended 79 suspected illegal
aliens today as an Eastern Airlines flight from Los Angeles made a
stopover here.
   ``We believe this is one of the largest operations we've
conducted that involves illegal aliens on board commercial aircraft
here in the U.S.,'' said Thomas P. Fischer, district director of the
Atlanta office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``This may be part of a massive alien smuggling operation,'' he
said, adding that the INS would continue to target such flights.
   INS agents, acting on tips from confidential sources at
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport and from undercover
operations around Los Angeles, boarded the plane shortly after its
arrival, said INS spokesman Tom Thomas. The plane was bound for New
York.
   ``We had about 25 immigration agents on the case,'' Thomas said.
   Thomas said the INS' sources indicated it had been ``a regular
occurrence'' for the past 30 days for illegal aliens to use the same
flight, and he estimated that thousands of illegal aliens had been
smuggled across the country on Eastern airliners.
   ``It appears at this point from our sources that it's almost a
daily occurrence,'' he said. He said he didn't know how the aliens
had gotten into the country.
   Thomas said Eastern had been very cooperative in the
investigation, adding, ``We don't in any way connect Eastern and
don't want to intimate that they were even remotely involved at this
point.''
   In Miami today, Eastern Airlines spokeswoman Virginia Sanchez
said, ``All I know is that the INS had told us they'd be monitoring
a flight this week and, of course, we cooperated with them.''
   Thirty-nine of the suspected aliens were from Mexico, 22 from
Guatemala, 13 from the Dominican Republic, three from El Salvador
and one each from Honduras and Ecuador. They were to be transferred
to INS processing centers in Florida and Texas for deportations, he
said.
   They were among 179 passengers who boarded in Los Angeles.
   ``We suspect that a smuggler assists them in boarding the
aircraft in Los Angeles,'' Thomas said, adding that the aliens
likely are greeted in New York by relatives and another smuggler.

<HEAD>Prince Charles Back Skiing a Year After Fatal Avalanche</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KLOSTERS, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles began a Swiss skiing
vacation Monday and passed the site of an avalanche that killed one
of his close friends and seriously injured another a year ago.
   Shortly after arrival in this alpine resort, the prince's group
rode a cable car up the same mountain where the snowslide struck
March 10, 1988. He hardly appeared to look when the cabin passed
near the spot.
   The party skied down the Gotschna mountain south of the accident
site.
   Authorities listed a moderate avalanche danger for the region.
   The heir to the British throne was accompanied by Charles
Palmer-Tomkinson, who was skiing with the prince when the avalanche
struck and whose wife, Patricia, suffered broken legs.
   Also along for the run Monday were Charles' ski teacher Bruno
Sprecher and a Swiss policeman.
   Charles, 40, is expected to spend the week at the royal family's
traditional winter holiday resort. Princess Diana was not among the
party.
   Charles narrowly escaped injury in last year's avalanche, which
roared down on a group of skiers he was leading on a steep run off
marked trails.
   His friend Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34, was killed. Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson suffered multiple fractures of both legs and was
hospitalized for weeks.
   Diana and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, were in a chalet
at the time of the tragedy.
   Charles had returned to Klosters after the avalanche to visit
Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson.
   Swiss authorities ruled that Charles' six-member group caused the
avalanche but nobody could be held personally responsible.

   Few from the West get to see North Korea, the
hermit of Asia. But Associated Press correspondent Cinty Li, who is
based in Hong Kong, recently was allowed to travel to Pyongyang for
a rare look at what's going on in a country that has largely sealed
itself off for four decades.

   Along the wide and immaculately
clean streets of Pyongyang, women with their heads wrapped in white
scarfs and men bundled up against the winter morning cold trudge off
to work.
   Most walk alone, their faces stern, their steps steady. Many wear
a tiny enamel picture pin of President Kim Il Sung, the omnipotent
dictator who has ruled the Communist nation throughout its four
decades of existence.
   Pyongyang is the capital of one of the world's most insular and
repressive countries, which is frequently accused of terrorist
activity and basic human rights violations.
   But this hermit of the world has begun to show stirrings of more
contact with the outside world, particularly with its two main foes,
the United States and South Korea.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into a communist North and
capitalist South after World War II. Although the two sides have yet
to sign a peace treaty after their 1950-1953 war, they are engaged
in cautious attempts to ease tension by talking about topics ranging
from a non-agression pact to trade.
   Meanwhile, North Korean and U.S. diplomats recently met in
Beijing, China's capital, in a rare display of direct contact.
   In July, Pyongyang will play host to the 13th World Festival of
Youth and Students, a gathering of communist and socialist youth
groups that North Korea expects will attract about 20,000 delegates
from more than 100 nations. The city also is under consideration as
site for the 1989 World Student Games.
   North Korea eagerly awaits the 13th World Festival and hopes it
will enhance the country's international stature, particularly after
the humiliation of watching Seoul, the South Korean capital,
successfully stage the Summer Olympics last year.
   ``With the opening day of the festival approaching, our hearts
are rushing to its venue,'' Kim Dong Yong, head of a train passenger
car workshop, wrote in a typically worded article in the official
magazine, Korea Today.
   Colorful posters announcing the coming festival ``for
anti-imperialist solidarity, peace and friendship,'' dot the
otherwise drab landscape of Pyongyang.
   Tourists who come to the capital are shown the facilities under
construction for the event, including the 150,000-seat Rungnado
Stadium on an island in the River Tae Dong and a 105-story building
said to be the world's tallest hotel.
   What festival-goers will see when they visit Pyongyang is perhaps
the world's ultimate Communist capital, unfettered by grand
reminders of a non-communist past. While Moscow has the Kremlin and
Beijing has the imperial Forbidden City, modern Pyongyang was built
from rubble after the Korean War.
   Today it is a city of 2 million residents, blocks of tall and
uninspired apartments, and six-lane streets uncluttered by vehicles,
leaving traffic police plenty of rest as they mechanically direct
the occasional bus, truck, East European car or sleek Mercedes.
   Commuters descend into chandeliered stations to take the subway
or patiently line up at bus stops. Pedestrians at major
intersections use underpasses beneath the broad streets despite the
dearth of traffic.
   Men in green military overcoats are visible on nearly every
street, although some carry briefcases and appear heading to work.
One carefully eyed a foreigner who bought a newspaper at a kiosk in
the capital while another blocked a tourist from taking a picture of
a dirty child at the border town of Sinuiju.
   The streets of Pyongyang are deserted at night, with only a dim
glow coming from street lamps and apartments. All revolutionary
monuments and statues, however, are bathed in lights.
   Socialist realism is the art style. Prime examples include a
heroic statue of a table tennis player and an indoor mural of
victorious communist forces, bloodied but not vanquished, smashing
the U.S. Army, which is reviled because it came to the aid of South
Korea in the Korean War and since.
   A two-hour acrobatic performance viewed by a group of tourists
included a skit about the downfall of a U.S. military policeman, who
was a caricature with blond hair, crooked nose and slightly hunched
back.
   A North Korean farmer got the best of the U.S. soldier by
tricking him into pulling a snake from a straw basket. The snake bit
the soldier until he fell unconcious. Placed on the fallen GI's back
was the slogan: ``American soldiers go home.''

<HEAD>Officials Say Record Seizures Don't Mean Agents Winning War Against
Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law enforcement agencies trumpet their seizure
of more than 800 pounds of heroin, calling it the largest drug
confiscation ever in the United States, but officials say that and
other similar seizures don't mean they're winning the war against
drugs.
   Every year, the government set records in the amount of drugs
confiscated, but seizures make ``just a dent'' in what's coming into
the country or being produced here, says Drug Enforcement
Administration spokesman Maurice Hill.
   ``There's more of it now'' than there was three years ago, no
matter how much is being seized, says Cornelius Dougherty, another
DEA spokesman.
   They say drugs lost to government raids are seen by drug dealers
as a mere cost of doing business.
   ``Historically, a manager of drug couriers gives up one courier
who is body carrying (drugs) to take your attention away from four
more,'' said Bill Norsworthy, a DEA agent at the El Paso
Intelligence Center in Texas.
   ``People walk away from a brand new aircraft after one load and
consider that an expense of the trip,'' he said. ``The same goes for
boats, automobiles, campers. They expect to pay a price.''
   Law enforcement agencies repeatedly seize millions of dollars in
drug profits that go unclaimed because to claim it would mean
proving ownership and thus where the money came from, Hill says.
   A better way to assess how the United States is doing in the war
on drugs is to concentrate on the price and purity level of the
drugs on the street, says Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.
   ``For too long, when we've asked whether or not our drug strategy
is working, the administration has cited record arrest and seizure
data,'' said Biden, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman.
   A check of price and purity of drugs on the streets, Biden said,
shows ``cocaine and heroin on the streets are much cheaper and more
potent than they were five years ago.''
   In 1982, cocaine sold at the retail level at a range, nationwide,
of $2,000 to $3,000 per ounce and was 50 percent to 60 percent pure,
Dougherty said.
   In 1988, the street price of cocaine had dropped to $500 to
$2,000 per ounce and it was 80 percent pure, said Dougherty, citing
information from drug seizures, undercover drug buys, intelligence,
and records seized.
   In 1985, a gram of heroin at 5.3 percent purity could be bought
on the street for a minimum of $115, he said. By 1988, the cost of a
gram at 6 percent to 8 percent purity was as low as $90.
   Drug busts gain a certain public popularity in part because there
are very few solid numbers about anything involving the war on
drugs, such as the level of illegal drugs in America.
   ``It's a quagmire,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson of
attempts to calculate the total amount of drugs confiscated. ``If
you add them up, you'll find the government got 10 times what it
actually seized. ... Everyone's trying to make themselves look
good.''
   Simpson invented a scenario in which the DEA provides the
intelligence, an Air Force radar locates the ship, a Navy jet spots
the ship, the Coast Guard tracks it and the final seizure is
conducted by a local sheriff in Florida.
   ``Even if everyone was trying to do the right thing and no one
was trying to cheat, it would still be a nightmare'' to sort out
various claims over the seizure, even though the agencies attempt to
note when they have assisted and when they have made a seizure
alone, he said.

   Cunanan is believed to have taken part in the Oct. 28, 1987,
slayings of three Americans and a Filipino of U.S. ancestry by a
communist assassination squad outside Clark Air Base, Espino said.
The base is in Angeles, a town 50 miles north of Manila.
   Espino said Cunanan is a member of the urban guerrilla Mariano
Garcia Brigade and also is suspected in the August 1987
assassination of police Capt. Francisco Timbol, who was gunned down
near Angeles city hall.
   The guerrillas want to establish a Marxist state.

<HEAD>Decade After TMI, Half In Poll See Another Accident As Likely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half the Americans in a national poll believe a
serious accident is likely at a U.S. nuclear power plant, despite
safeguards put in place since the Three Mile Island accident a
decade ago.
   Fifty-five percent of the respondents in the Media
General-Associated Press survey supported the use of nuclear power
to generate electricity. But eight in 10 favored tougher federal
safety regulations, and most opposed building new plants.
   Most also opposed starting up completed nuclear power plants that
are not yet running. And while 48 percent said currently operating
plants should stay open, 44 percent said they should be either
phased out or shut down at once.
   The national survey of 1,162 adults had a margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percent. It was conducted Jan. 4-12 in advance of the
10th anniversary of the accident March 28, 1979, at the Three Mile
Island plant in Middletown, Pa.
   Tighter federal regulation of the nuclear power industry resulted
from the TMI accident, which destroyed one of the plant's two
reactors.
   In the survey, 63 percent said they believed nuclear power plants
are safer now.
   However, when asked to rate the chance of a serious accident at a
nuclear power plant in the United States, 11 percent chose ``highly
likely'' and 39 percent said likely, for a total of 50 percent.
Thirty percent said a serious accident was unlikely and 14 percent
said ``highly unlikely,'' for a total of 44 percent. The remaining 6
percent had no opinion.
   An overwhelming 79 percent said the federal government should be
tougher in enforcing safety rules. And 62 percent said governors
should have the power to shut down nuclear power plants in their
states.
   Regulation aside, 56 percent said they believe it is impossible
to safely store long-term radioactive waste from nuclear power
plants. Just 27 percent called safe storage possible and 18 percent
weren't sure.
   Support for nuclear power was markedly higher among men and
Republicans. Two-thirds of those groups supported nuclear power
generally, compared with half the Democrats and independents and
just 45 percent of the women polled.
   Six in 10 women and as many Democrats said an accident was
likely, compared with four in 10 of the men and the Republicans.
While 58 percent of the respondents with high school educations
feared an accident, that fell to 37 percent of those with
postgraduate schooling.
   Only a third overall said more nuclear power plants should be
built in the United States; of those who favored more plants,
three-quarters said they would accept one within 10 miles of their
home. No new nuclear power plant construction permits have been
issued since 1979.
   Just two in 10 said nuclear power plants that have been completed
but not yet licensed should be allowed to open. Such plants in
Seabrook, N.H., and Shoreham, N.Y., have been stalled in part by
opposition from the governor in New York and, in Seabrook's case,
the governor of neighboring Massachusetts.
   Six in 10 said governors should have the authority to prevent a
nuclear plant from opening in their states, and as many said
governors should be able to shut down operating plants. Governors do
not have such power now.
   Forty-eight percent said the nation's 108 fully operating
commercial nuclear power plants should continue to operate, 35
percent said they should be phased out gradually, 9 percent said
they should be closed immediately and 8 percent had no opinion.
   Of those who wanted the plants phased out, a third wanted it done
within five years, about a third within 10 years and the rest would
allow longer.

<HEAD>Poll Of 1,162 Adults On Nuclear Power</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poll-Nuclear Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Jan. 4-12 with 1,162 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult in the household called who
had the most recent birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points, meaning
that if every adult American were asked the same questions, the
results theoretically would be within three points of the poll's
results, 19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for
subgroups _ four points, for example, for men.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. Do you support or oppose using nuclear power to generate
electricity? Support: 55 percent. Oppose: 34 percent. Don't know or
no answer: 11.
   2a. (Of those who do not oppose nuclear power) Do you think more
nuclear power plants should be built in the United States, or not?
Yes: 50. No: 37. DK-NA: 13.
   b. (If yes) Would you support or oppose the construction of a
nuclear power plant within 10 miles of your home? Support: 73.
Oppose: 25. DK-NA: 2.
   3. (Of those who do not oppose nuclear power) Do you think
nuclear power plants that have been completed but not licensed to
generate electricity should be allowed to operate, or not? Yes: 32.
No: 60. DK-NA: 8.
   4a. Should currently operating nuclear power plants continue
operating, should they be phased out gradually, or should they be
closed down immediately? Operate: 48. Phase out: 35. Close down: 9.
DK-NA: 8.
   b. (If phase out) Would you want all nuclear power plants shut
down within five years, 10 years, 15 years or 20 or more years?
Five: 33. Ten: 36. Fifteen: 11. 20 or more: 15. DK-NA: 6.
   5. Do you think nuclear power plants in the United States are
safer now than they were 10 years ago, or not? Yes: 63. No: 25.
DK-NA: 12.
   6. Do you think it's possible to safely store long-term
radioactive waste from nuclear power plants, or not? Yes: 27. No:
56. DK-NA: 18.
   7. How would you rate the likelihood of a serious accident at a
nuclear power plant in the United States _ highly likely, likely,
unlikely or highly unlikely? Highly likely: 11. Likely: 39.
Unlikely: 30. Highly unlikely: 14. DK-NA: 6.
   8. Should the federal government be tougher when it comes to
enforcing safety rules at nuclear power plants, or is it tough
enough now, or is it too tough? Tougher: 79. Tough enough: 14. Too
tough: 1. DK-NA: 7.
   9. Should a governor have the authority to keep a nuclear power
plant from opening in his or her state? Yes: 58. No: 35. DK-NA: 8.
   10. Should a governor have the authority to shut down an
operating nuclear power plant in his or her state? Yes: 62. No: 31.
DK-NA: 7.

   If there were a national police blotter, the
daily killings and robberies would chronicle a bloody struggle in
every city with the potent enemy called drugs. To chart one day's
crime in America, Associated Press reporters in nine cities rode in
squad cars, shadowed undercover officers and pored through police
reports on Feb. 22. Here are their findings.

   Eric Williams, 19, sat in the fading heat of an 86-degree Los
Angeles day when a car full of menacing young men cruised down Van
Ness Avenue at 7:30 p.m.
   Shotgun blasts exploded from the car, and Williams fell dead in a
crime known as a drive-by shooting. Williams was not known to be a
member of a gang. He may have just been in the way of shots aimed at
someone else, police said, or he may have been wearing the colors of
a rival outfit.
   ``A wrong look or wearing the wrong color in a certain
neighborhood can get you killed,'' said Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Capt. Raymond Gott.
   Of the 55 slayings in Williams' neighborhood this year, 15 are
believed related to gangs wiping out competitors and protecting
their turf.
   At least four gangs grossed $1 million a week each last year in
cocaine sales, according to Police Commander Lorne Kramer.
   ``These urban terrorists are destroying hopes for a normal
life,'' said Kramer.

   Similar battles are played out daily in every major U.S. city
where police fight drugs and crime, which often go hand in hand. On
a given day, an average of 2,568 arrests are made for possessing,
selling and making drugs, according to the FBI.
   Half to three-fourths of the people arrested for serious crimes
tested positive for illicit drug use, according to a 1988 U.S.
Justice Department study. Drugs can lead to murder, assault,
prostitution, theft, robbery and burglary.
   ``Crime and drugs are umbilically connected,'' said Peter
Bensinger, former director of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration and now a drug consultant in Chicago. ``The impact is
devastating our cities and our streets.''

   New York fights the street-by-street war with a Tactical
Narcotics Team, or TNT, a sort of special forces unit whose uniforms
are filthy jeans and shabby sweat shirts rather than green berets.
   Steady rain didn't stop them from donning bulletproof vests and
earphones connected to hidden walkie-talkies.
   ``A junkie doesn't know rain, a junkie doesn't know sleet or
cold, a junkie just wants to get off,'' said Lt. Joseph Murphy.
   Among the busts this day, an undercover officer got past a
lookout and into a drug den, the basement of an abandoned building
that reeked of urine and rotting garbage in the South Bronx.
   The officer bought heroin, and others waiting in an unmarked car
moved in for the bust. Three arrests netted a fistful of heroin
packets worth $100. A search of the dealer's office showed 170 of
400 heroin packets were sold before the raid.
   In one week, police arrested 125 people and seized 16 cars, two
guns, $8,633 in cash and a cache of cocaine, crack, heroin and pot.

   With the temperature at 36 degrees, a 20-mph wind whipped through
southeast Atlanta, a tough neighborhood known by the cops as ``The
Zoo.''
   ``They should put a cage around the whole zone,'' said patrolman
Scott Bennett.
   The cold slowed the drug trade to about one-third its usual pace.
But Ricky Davis was arrested for alleged possession after a chase.
Police found a leather pouch containing nine plastic bags, each
holding a pea-sized fragment of crack cocaine.
   At one point, a reporter was advised to duck behind a trash bin
if gunfire erupted.

   In Miami, an undercover narcotics team made 14 arrests in
assembly line fashion. One was a 16-year-old selling crack outside
his apartment.
   Across the city that day, about 200 of an estimated 1,000 armed
robberies, auto thefts and burglaries were believed to have been
drug-related, said police spokesman Ray Lang.

   In Dallas, six men were face down on the floor of an abandoned,
smoke-filled apartment while a few officers stood over them with
guns drawn.
   ``This is a day-in, day-out battle,'' said Lt. Don Richie, who
heads the evening crew at Dallas Police Department's central
division.
   If a crack addict has a $20,000-a-year habit, he must steal about
$200,000 worth of goods to support it, according to Capt. E.R. Walt
of the Narcotics Division.
   ``Most crack addicts don't work and couldn't afford it if they
did,'' Walt said. ``So there's a lot of stuff stolen.''

   A 17-year-old St. Louis man was busted on his birthday Wednesday
when police seized $1,500 in cash and $4,700 in drugs.
   Police saw him selling drugs the day before but couldn't find his
stash. ``Yeah, man, I'll be 17,'' he taunted officers.
   ``So they paid a visit to his house on his birthday,'' said Sgt.
Leman Dobbins. ``If he's going to play in the grown folks' world,
we're going to treat him like one.''
   Police said six of the 14 crimes reported Wednesday were
drug-related.
   ``We've run across some dope dealers (with) a Mercedes Benz
that's paid for in cash. But when you got to arrest him, he doesn't
even know how to spell his middle name,'' Dobbins said. ``Whoever
said crime does not pay is a fool.''

   The 52 drug arrests in Baltimore on Wednesday included a federal
fugitive wanted for allegedly helping a notorious drug kingpin
arrange a multimillion-dollar heroin deal from his jail cell. Three
other arrests followed a raid that netted $500,000 worth of cocaine
and heroin.
   Roland Hines, 26, of Baltimore was arrested at 8 p.m. He was one
of five people indicted by a federal grand jury in November on
charges of conspiring in the sale of 5 kilograms, or 11 pounds, of
heroin to an informant in Boston.

   In Pittsburgh, 24 of 75 arrests Wednesday were drug-related,
police said.
   Three came at a townhouse where police found dozens of bags of
marijuana, cocaine, crack, $2,800 in cash, drug paraphernalia and a
police radio scanner. Also in the house were a homemade apple pie in
the oven and a wall papered with high school attendance awards and
varsity football certificates.
   Shawn Poindexter, 18, his stepfather, Bryant K. Sneed, 30, and
his mother, Beverly Sneed, 39, were arrested.

five to eight drug arrests.

<HEAD>Top Industrialist Says Country `Stinks' Because of Apartheid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the country's leading
industrialists said Monday that apartheid ``has made South Africa
stink'' and urged the government to draft a long-term plan for
reform.
   Harry Oppenheimer, 80-year-old former chairman of the Anglo
American Corp, mining conglomerate, said in a speech the government
must abandon its cautious, piecemeal approach to reform and stop
trying to appease right-wing whites.
   He said foreign countries would respond favorably to ``a bold
commitment to consistent, long-range reform.''
   ``Disagreeable though it may be, we must admit that the racial
policy which has been pursued here over the last 40 years has made
South Africa stink in the nostrils of decent, humane people around
the world,'' he said.
   Oppenheimer said South Africa's disenfranchised black majority
will reject the free enterprise system ``unless they are enabled to
share to the full in the great benefits it can bring. That is
certainly not the case today.''
   ``The immediate need therefore is to open the economy in a fair
and equal way to all South Africans,'' he said. ``That calls,
amongst other things, for the repeal of the Group Areas Act,'' which
mandates racial segregation of residential areas.
   In other developments Monday:
   _ Lawyers and civil rights workers said about 80 detainees have
been released in the 10 days since Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok held negotiations to resolve a widespread hunger strike. Vlok
told anti-apartheid clergymen that a ``substantial number'' of the
estimated 1,000 detainees held without charge would be freed within
two weeks.
   Four hunger strikers who had been admitted to Johannesburg
Hospital were released Monday, but they told reporters they had been
placed under restrictions barring them from political activity and
requiring them to be in their homes at night.
   Most of the more than 300 hunger strikers suspended their fast
pending an assessment of the government's response. But lawyers say
some detainees in Natal Province are continuing the strike,
demanding to be freed or charged.
   _ Blacks living around the mining town of Carletonville began a
boycott of white-owned shops to protest a resegregation campaign by
the town council.
   Councilors of the extreme-right Conservative Party, which took
power in a local election in October, have reinstated
``whites-only'' status at local parks and plan to build a fence to
keep blacks off the town hall's lawn.
   White businessmen in Carletonville, worried about the effects of
a boycott, met Monday to discuss ways of reversing the council's
action. Conservative Party officials said they will not bow to
pressure.
   _ In Parliament, Conservative Party members moved to condemn the
government for creating ``a continued state of lawlessness'' by
failing to evict non-whites living illegally in inner-city areas
that officially are ``whites only.''

<HEAD>Shamir Bills Municipal Vote as Referendum on PLO Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir billed Tuesday's
nationwide municipal elections as a referendum on the Arab-Israeli
conflict, saying gains for his right-wing Likud bloc would show the
world Israel will never talk to the PLO.
   ``Every vote for Likud means that Israel wants no truck with the
murderers of our sons who want to destroy Israel,'' Shamir was
quoted as saying Monday by the Jerusalem Post.
   But leaders of the left-leaning Labor Party rejected Shamir's
claim, saying local, not national, issues are at stake, and that the
personalities of the candidates take precedent over ideology.
   ``It's completely off the subject. We will focus on the issues
that count, day-to-day municipal issues,'' said Daniel Eldar,
Labor's campaign manager.
   Two issues that played a role in the November general elections
probably will spill over into the municipal voting: the
religious-secular conflict and the nearly 15-month-old Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Pro-Palestine Liberation Organization underground leaders of the
uprising have urged the about 70,000 Arab voters in east Jerusalem
to boycott the elections, and called a general strike for Tuesday to
enforce the order.
   At the same time, the army ordered the occupied lands sealed from
midnight Monday to 10 p.m. Tuesday, barring West Bank and Gaza
residents from entering Israel.
   Political analysts, meanwhile, predicted gains for the religious
parties similar to those in the November elections. In that vote,
relivious parties increased their representation from 14 to 18 seats
in the 120-member Parliament, alarming many secular Israelis.
   About 2.7 million Israelis, of them 400,000 Arabs, are eligible
to vote in 147 municipalities, choosing mayors and 1,341 council
members. There are 99 municipalities in the Jewish sector, and 48 in
the Arab sector.
   In the 1983 elections, 55 percent of the voters cast ballots, and
election officials expect a similar turnout this year. In the last
general elections, turnout was nearly 80 percent.
   In 1983, Labor won in 54 municipalities, compared with 26 towns
ruled by Likud. The remainder of the towns are run by local
political groups or religious parties.
   Each voter casts two ballots, one for mayor and one for a party
slate. Parties are awarded seats in the City Council according to
the number of votes won.
   Key contests are in the three largest cities: Jerusalem, Tel Aviv
and Haifa.
   In Jerusalem, Mayor Teddy Kollek is assured re-election to a
sixth term, but his Labor-affiliated ``One Jerusalem'' list might
lose control of the 31-member City Council because of the Arab
boycott and the growing strength of the religious parties.
   Working with a hostile council might force Kollek to make
concessions to right-wing and religious parties, thus further
escalating the Arab-Israeli and religious-secular conflicts dividing
the city.
   In Tel Aviv, the only major city run by Likud, popular Mayor
Shlomo Lahat is likely to win a fourth term. Lahat says he has
turned Tel Aviv into an international metropolis and promised
secular voters to keep the city free from religious coercion.
   The religious parties insist on closing entertainment spots,
including restaurants and movie theaters, on the Jewish Sabbath, the
biblically mandated day of rest that lasts from sundown Friday to
sundown Saturday.
   Haifa, a stronghold of the left for decades, has become a major
battleground for the two big parties.
   ``We have red flags all over the country, and we would like to
paint some of them blue (the color of Likud),'' said Likud's
campaign organizer, Nimrod Granit.
   ``Taking Haifa would be like taking Stalingrad,'' Granit said,
referring to the Soviet city in which the Red Army successfully
withstood a German offensive during World War II.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi said Monday he
will resign in a week unless the army promises not to overthrow him
and leaders of trade and professional unions pledge not to strike.
   Price riots and general strikes nearly four years ago prompted
the army to oust President Gaafar Nimeiri, who had ruled Sudan for
16 years. Mahdi's civilian government was elected a year later.
   Mahdi's comments were made in a speech to Parliament on Monday _
the deadline the military gave him a week ago for choosing a new
Cabinet and trying to end the 6-year-old civil war in southern Sudan.
   Army officials did not say what they would do if Mahdi did not
meet their conditions and had no immediate reaction to his speech,
but sources in the military said privately the high command was
assessing it.
   On their clandestine radio station, the rebels claimed to have
captured Torit, a strategic garrison town in Equatoria province that
had been under siege for months.
   Mahdi told Parliament the army ultimatum did not threaten a coup,
then demanded assurances there would not be one. After the ultimatum
was issued Feb. 20, a military spokesman said he would not describe
it as a coup threat.
   The army made its demands after Defense Minister Abdel-Meguid
Khalil resigned.
   Khalil quit in protest of the government's refusal to endorse a
peace agreement proposed in November by the Democratic Unionist
Party, which was part of the government coalition at the time, and
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   After Mahdi refused to submit the plan to the Cabinet or
Parliament, the Unionists left the government.
   Four gunmen opened fire Monday on the house of Syd Ahmed Ali
Mirghani, whose brother, Mohammed Osman, is the Democratic Unionist
Party leader, and fled when guards returned the fire. No injuries
were reported.
   Syd Ahmed Ali Mirghani heads the Sudanese Council of State, a
collective presidency, and is a member of Khatmiya, one of Sudan's
two principal Moslem sects. Mahdi leads the other sect, Ansar.
   Three people were arrested later Monday and the van was found,
the official Sudan News Agency reported.
   A similar attack was made on Mohammed Osman Mirghani's home in
November, also with no injuries.
   Mahdi said Monday he would ``make efforts'' to form a broad-based
government to create political unity and end the war.
   Rebels led by John Garang, a former army colonel, seek more
economic advantages for the south, most of whose people are black
Christians or animists, and autonomy from the the overwhelmingly
Arab and Moslem north.
   In its broadcast, the rebel radio said Torit, 750 miles south of
Khartoum, was captured on Sunday. It said two senior army officers,
a brigadier and a colonel, and the provincial commissioner were
taken prisoner.
   There was no confirmation from the government. Independent
verification of such claims is impossible because travel in the
south is not permitted.
   If the report is true, Torit would be the eighth major town to
fall to rebels in Equatoria and Upper Nile provinces.
   Rebels occupied Liria, 45 miles southeast of the provincial
capital Juba, 10 days ago, cutting Torit off from government supply
lines. Juba is one of the main rebel targets.
   The prime minister said Sudan would be receiving aircraft, tanks,
rocket launchers, long-range artillery, an air-defense system,
gunboats and other weapons, but did not say who would supply them.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Soviets Sent $515 Million in Weapons to Sandinistas in
1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union exported about $515 million
worth of military equipment to Nicaragua last year, the second
highest total since the Kremlin began weapons deliveries in 1980,
according to a new U.S. government report.
   The report says last year's delivery of 19,000 tons of equipment
came during 68 ship visits to Nicaraguan ports, an average of about
one every six days.
   The unclassified analysis, compiled by intelligence agencies,
said the peak year for Soviet arms shipments was 1986 when the
Sandinistas received $550 million worth of equipment.
   That was the last year Congress approved military aid for the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   A year ago, Congress suspended military aid to the Contras, and
as the months passed, Reagan administration officials expressed deep
disappointment that the Soviets did not reciprocate by cutting back
on weapons shipments to the Sandinistas.
   The aid suspension was quickly followed by an interim cease-fire
between the Sandinistas and the Contras in late March. Subsequently,
about 11,000 Contras fled to camps in Honduras along the border
where the rebels are sustained by a U.S. humanitarian aid program.
   The Sandinistas have contended that continued Soviet arms
shipments were needed in the event the United States decided to
resume military aid to the Contras.
   The Kremlin has said that it would suspend arms deliveries to the
Sandinistas as part of an overall ban on outside arms shipments to
Central America, but the United States has shown no interest in that
proposal.
   The $515 million listed for 1988 is described in the report as a
preliminary estimate which is subject to revision as new data become
available. U.S. officials have estimated Soviet economic aid to
Nicaragua at about $500 million annually.
   A U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said estimates
of military aid were somewhat easier to make last year because a
lack of storage space forced the Sandinistas to leave much of the
equipment out in the open where it could be photographed by U.S.
intelligence agencies.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have shown an ability to
work together on several regional conflicts, including Afghanistan,
Angola-Namibia and the Iran-Iraq war.
   But the superpowers remain deeply divided over Nicaragua. The
United States looks on the continuing Soviet arms deliveries as the
most troubling aspect of Soviet involvement in that area.
   Former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said last
month before leaving office that economic decline in Nicaragua has
left the Sandinista government somewhat weaker but that the weapons
deliveries have made it stronger militarily.
   The report said that the Sandinista army, including ``active duty
and mobilized militia-reserves,'' totaled 80,000 at the start of
1989, the same figure as a year earlier.
   The Sandinista inventory also included 150 tanks, 250 other
armored vehicles, 32 fixed-wing aircraft, 50 helicopters and six
airfields, the report said.
   The type of equipment received by the Sandinistas in 1988 was not
specified in the report.

<TEXT>
   For a time Monday the most pressing
question for some of the highest officials of the U.S. government
was: Which ones are my shoes?
   The top poohbahs of the Bush White House had to leave their shoes
at the door when they lunched in the pleasant wooden surroundings of
the Ever Spring House on the grounds of the Blue House, the
fortified residence of Korean presidents.
   That's Korean tradition. No problem.
   But when lunch was over there they were, in a neat row, the nine
pairs of nearly identical black slip-on shoes that clearly are
favored by the upper crust of the Bush team.
   Which were Secretary of State James Baker's and which were Chief
of Staff John Sununu's? Which belonged to Brent Scowcroft, the
temporarily shoeless national security adviser, and which to Gaston
Sigur, the assistant secretary of state?
   With all the dignity they could command, they stood on the porch
of the Ever Spring House, long-handled shoehorns in hand, figuring
out which shoes belonged to which feet.
   They did it, and were shod in time for the formal ceremony ending
Bush's talk and lunch with President Roh Tae-Woo, the former
four-star general who is Bush's Korean counterpart.
   Bush had no problem with his shoes. The presidential shoes were
the only ones of the American party that were laced, traditional
black wingtips.
   It didn't even matter, hoever, since a Korean aide whisked Bush's
shoes inside at the last minute, sparing the president the need to
put them on in public.
   If shoes were a problem, so were legs, at lunch. The Ever Spring
House is a handsome Korean building of 52 red pine pillars, and the
meal served inside was equally traditional, including the sitting
arrangements.
   Sitting was on seats that lack legs. The president, who stands
6-feet-2, did not know quite where to put his feet that lacked shoes.
   So he asked his host, Roh, ``Do you put your legs straight out or
do you fold them up?'' The president of Korea showed the president
of the United States how to fit his long legs under the low table.
   Bush was in Korea for a friendship stop on the way home from his
trip to the funeral of Emperor Hirohito of Japan and his visit to
China.
   He talked and lunched with Roh _ pumpkin porridge, three kinds of
fish, sliced marinated beef, dumpling soup, rice cakes and
milky-white Korean rice wine. But mostly he posed for pictures duing
his Korean visit of less than five hours.
   He posed at the airport, where Koreans waving paper flags held up
signs reading: ``Great Regard for George Bush.''
   He posed with Roh upon arriving at the Blue House, and with Roh's
wife, and when he signed the guest book. He posed during the talks,
photographers being allowed in in relays, assembly line fashion.
   He posed before lunch in the Ever Spring House, with his shoes
off. (The photographers were equally unshod.)
   He posed after lunch with Roh after both declared their talks a
great success in remarks written before the session started.
   At the National Assembly, Bush posed with the assembly speaker
and the speaker's wife. Just a few more pictures at the airport with
members of the American community and Bush was ready to head home.
   Bush went by helicopter everywhere he traveled in Seoul. Parts of
the city, including near the U.S. Embassy and the university, saw
ugly police-demonstrator clashes, but the airborne Bush never laid
eyes on an angry Korean.

   The governors of Michigan, Iowa, Ohio,
Missouri, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Indiana agreed Monday to share
the cost of a low-level nuclear waste site, said Gov. James
Blanchard of Michigan.
   In January, Blanchard had halted site selection in Michigan until
the other states in the Midwest Interstate Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Compact met demands designed to ensure Michigan bore only its
fair share of the financial burden.
   He ordered the site-selection process to resume after the states
agreed to his terms.
   ``No one wants to be left holding the bag with the low-level
waste issue,'' Blanchard said in announcing the agreement.
   Blanchard and the governors of Iowa, Ohio, Missouri, Minnesota,
Wisconsin and Indiana reached agreement on the waste site Monday
after two days of conferences during the National Governors'
Association winter meeting.
   ``We support the party states sharing reponsibility and liability
for those expenses not paid for by insurance or the funds
established in Michigan statute, and that share be based on a
prorated amount according to the amount of waste generated in each
state,'' the governors said in a joint letter to Blanchard.
   The governors also agreed that each state would continue to pay
its share of the disposal site's operation even if the state
withdraws from the Midwest compact.
   The disposal plant would cost an estimated $300 million over its
20-year life, said J.D. Snyder, Blanchard's aide dealing with
environmental issues.
   With the agrement, Michigan's share could be less than one-third
of that amount, Snyder said.
   Had the other states failed to agree to Blanchard's terms,
Michigan would have had to pay the full cost of building and
operating the plant.
   The state legislatures would need to approve spending on the
site, Blanchard said, adding he foresaw no difficulty in obtaining
the funding.
   Michigan was selected as the site for the nuclear waste dump
because it generates the most radioactive waste in the region.
   Michigan generated about 27,000 cubic feet of low-level
radioactive waste last year from nuclear plants, research
institutions and hospitals.
   Michigan's nuclear waste now goes to sites in South Carolina and
Washington, whose governors threatened to refuse to accept Michigan
waste unless Blanchard rescinded his order halting site selection.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador Says Swedish Texts Misrepresent America</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedish students are getting a distorted
view of the United States in their schoolbooks, U.S. Ambassador
Gregory Newell said Monday.
   Newell, who is leaving Stockholm in June after three years as
ambassador, said the American view of Sweden as a permissive and
socialistic country also was inaccurate, and the two countries
should get to know each other better.
   Newell's complaint was based on a study of about 50 history books
and other texts for the Swedish equivalent of high school and junior
high. The results of the review were reported to Washington, U.S.
officials said.
   Many of the books were outdated and written in a period when
Sweden was outspokenly critical of the U.S. involvement in the
Vietnam War.
   In one book, the few sentences about Vietnam included the fact
that U.S. planes dropped more bombs there than fell in World War II,
said an embassy official who spoke on condition he was not
identified.
   Newer books also gave too much stress to racial problems, poverty
and homelessness, the official said.
   Newell, speaking on Swedish Radio, cited a series of texts he saw
three years ago titled ``Reagan's America.''
   ``The picture and the facts were accurate but they weren't full.
They talked about poverty levels, they talked about compassion
lacking and the underprivileged of Reagan's America,'' he said.
   They made no mention of the creation of new jobs and the
reduction of inflation, he said. ``Those sorts of things we don't
see treated in a balanced way. That is our concern,'' Newell added.

<HEAD>Baker to Meet with Shevardnadze, NATO Ministers in Vienna</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet overtures to Israel and Iran will be on
the agenda when Secretary of State James A. Baker III meets next
week in Vienna with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Baker also will hold separate talks with the foreign ministers of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and participate in ceremonies
marking the opening of new East-West arms control negotiations, the
State Department announced Monday.
   The negotiations concern concentrations of NATO and Warsaw Pact
ground forces and tanks in Europe. The goal is to reduce them as a
means of easing East-West tensions.
   Spokesman Charles E. Redman said Baker would leave Washington for
the Austrian capital on Saturday and return on March 7. The
negotiations will open March 9 under a broad agreement between the
United States and the Soviet Union reached last year to supersede 15
years of futile discussions.
   The talks that failed dealt with Central Europe. The new
negotiations will cover the vast expanse of the continent _ from the
Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union to the Atlantic Ocean.
   Baker's meeting with Shevardnadze was described by Redman as a
``get-acquainted'' session. The Soviet foreign minister has just
completed a trip to the Middle East in which he offered a resumption
of relations to Israel if it would negotiate with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, and has been to Tehran.
   Shevardnadze spoke to the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the
spiritual leader of Iran, who proposed closer ties to the Soviet
Union to counter what the fundamentalist cleric called ``devilish
acts of the West.''
   Redman confirmed the Middle East and Iran were on Baker's agenda
for the Shevardnadze meeting.
   The Bush administration is in the midst of reviewing U.S. policy
toward the Soviet Union and the Middle East. President Bush said
last week he foresaw only a limited role for the Soviets in the
region and that he would not be ``stampeded'' into taking decisions
as a result of the Soviet initiative.
   Baker is due to report to the NATO foreign ministers, meanwhile,
on how he views prospects for Arab-Israeli diplomacy. Several of
them urged him during a trip to Western Europe earlier this month to
take advantage of what they considered to be Palestinian moderation.
   Baker remarked at the time that ``one has to till the ground
carefully; one has to proceed cautiously and understand that if you
push the level of discussion too high, too soon, and create too much
international attention you might pre-empt opportunities.''

<HEAD>Recalled Mayor Announces New Bid For Top City Job</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 4th graf, `Among Boyle's...', to add dates
of elections.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Mayor Mike Boyle, ousted in a 1987
recall election, announced today that he will run again for the
city's top job.
   In announcing his candidacy, Boyle said he decided to run because
he loves politics and public service and because a surprisingly
large number of people urged him to enter the race.
   ``I believe I have learned much from the mistakes that I made
when I was mayor, that I have grown from those experiences and that
I could provide seasoned and thoughtful leadership for the people of
Omaha,'' Boyle said.
   Among Boyle's opponents in the non-partisan primary is city
Councilman Jim Cleary, who gained prominence as leader of the Boyle
recall movement in 1987 and later was elected to the city council.
   The primary is set for April 4, the general election for May 9.
   Boyle, 45, was elected mayor in 1981 and re-elected in 1985. But
opponents began gathering petition signatures shortly after his
second term started.
   They accused Boyle of abusing his power, meddling in police
affairs, being soft on drunken driving and being disrespectful,
citing an incident in which he allegedly threw pats of butter during
a dinner-table argument.
   On Jan. 13, 1987, Boyle became the first mayor in Omaha's history
to be recalled with 56 percent of voters supporting the recall and
44 percent in favor or retaining Boyle.
   Boyle returned to a private law practice after the recall.
   Both Boyle and Cleary said the recall will not be an issue in the
mayoral race.
   ``It's been over two years. I don't think people want the recall
revisited,'' Boyle said Sunday, before officially announcing his
candidacy.
   Also in the mayoral race are Mayor Walter Calinger, City Council
President Fred Conley, former Douglas County Commissioner Steve
McCollister and real estate manager P.J. Morgan.

<HEAD>Editor of Reagan's Pending Memoirs Has Similar Background</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a likely combination for a book of memoirs.
The editor, one of the most powerful in U.S. publishing, also writes
potboilers and has Hollywood connections. The author, former
President Ronald Reagan, is a powerbroker with a ``B'' movie past.
   Michael Korda, son of film art director Vincent Korda, certainly
knows about power. He is editor-in-chief at Simon &amp; Schuster, has
written best-selling tomes including ``Queenie'' and the how-to
``Power!'' and has been editor for presidents and novelists.
   As Korda, 55, prepares to work on Reagan's memoirs, his own
easy-to-digest novel ``The Fortune,'' about the shenanigans of a
powerful and rich family, is appearing in bookstores.
   ``It can be argued I like to write about subjects that are flashy
and glamorous. ... So does Jackie Collins,'' Korda said during a
recent stop here on a promotional tour.
   ``I guess I'm interested in the penalties that come with having
too much,'' says Korda.
   Korda has worked with a varied group of authors that includes
Graham Greene, Harold Robbins, Anthony Burgess, Edward Koch, Charles
DeGaulle, Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, Jimmy Carter, Tennessee
Williams and the Collins sisters, Jackie and Joan.
   He has always moved easily in conservative circles although he is
a Democrat.
   ``I'm a Kennedy Democrat _ an old Kennedy, not the new one,'' he
said, distinguishing between the late president and his brother,
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
   It's too early to talk about what the Reagan book will be like,
Korda said. No publication date has been set.
   ``I can't tell you what's going to be in the book.'' he said.
``But there are millions and millions of Americans who voted for him
twice, who regard him as a great American hero. Forget whether you
agree with him or not.''
   Korda said he knows little of Reagan's writing plans, even
whether the book will be composed on legal pad or computer terminal.
He quotes Reagan's public statement that he won't employ a
ghostwriter.
   Korda refuses to disclose the size of the deal with Reagan,
saying that's the author's prerogative. Before the contract was
announced Jan. 25, a literary agent guessed the book would bring
more than $5 million.
   However Reagan delivers his version of his life, Korda says any
book by the best-selling president is sure to be a best-seller, too.
   Reagan is no stranger to Simon &amp; Schuster. The publisher wanted a
book by Reagan even before he ran for governor of California, Korda
said. The subject then was to be Reagan's account of his time
heading the Screen Actor's Guild during the 1950s era of McCarthyism.
   Korda's editing technique is discreet and sideways. He won't tell
the memoirist what to include, but he might nudge a little.
   Then there are Korda's own ventures as an author, the novel
``Queenie'' based on the life of his actress aunt, the late Merle
Oberon, and a memoir, ``Charmed Lives.''
   He's also written how-tos, including ``Male Chauvinism! How It
Works'' and ``Power! How to Get It, How to Use It.''
   Those books responded to a time when people were most interested
in taking and using power, he said. They preceded the excesses of
the Nixon administration, larger numbers of women in the workforce
and the polarized wealth that resulted in more millionaires and more
have-nots, he said.
   ``Today people are much more interested in money, domestic life,
in happiness, in having a fulfilled and complete life,'' Korda said.
   Thus, his new book, ``The Fortune,'' concerns a family of
billionaires fighting over sex and money.
   ``For eight years we've had relative prosperity, at least for
middle-class white people. ... You've got a country on the whole
that's not interested in civil rights. Even Jesse Jackson doesn't
refer to the civil rights movement anymore. We've written off the
poor as a matter of interest.''

<HEAD>Business Economists See Recession by End of Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy will slow substantially in 1989
with rising inflation and higher interest rates likely to topple the
country into a recession before the end of next year, the nation's
top business economists predicted Monday.
   The National Association of Business Economists said a survey of
its members found them slightly more optimistic about growth
prospects for this year than they were three months ago.
   But by lopsided numbers, the economists were still predicting
that the most likely date for the start of the next recession was
1990.
   Three out of four of the economists surveyed expected a new
recession sometime in the next two years. However, the number
predicting a downturn in 1989 dropped from 40 percent to 19 percent
in the latest survey.
   Jay Woodworth, president of the association, said that economists
were more optimistic about 1989 in part because of signs that auto
sales, retail spending and housing construction were holding up even
with the increase in interest rates.
   ``The business economists feel that this expansion is not at the
end of its string yet. We probably have another year or so to go,''
Woodworth, senior domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co. of New
York, said at a news briefing.
   The new survey was taken before the latest round of
credit-tightening on the part of the Federal Reserve Board. Last
Friday, the Fed boosted its discount rate, the interest it charges
to make loans to financial institions, to 7 percent. A hike in the
discount rate is the most dramatic signal the central bank can send
of its intentions to push interest rates higher to dampen an
overheated economy.
   The business economists expressed strong support for the Fed's
inflation-fighting battle, with 70 percent expecting the board to
boost interest rates further in the next six months.
   Woodward said the inflationary pressures, if they do not start
receding, would likely take their toll on the expansion, which has
already lasted a peacetime record of six years.
   ``Inflation rates of 5 percent to 5.25 percent are too high to be
consistent with long-term growth and over time they would send the
economy into a recession,'' he said.
   The median forecast for growth this year, as measured by the
gross national product, was 2.7 percent, up slightly from a 2.5
percent estimate made by the business economists three months ago.
The economy grew at a four-year high of 3.8 percent last year.
   The Bush administration has based its first budget on an estimate
that the economy will slow only modestly in 1989 to a growth rate of
3.2 percent, but this estimate is about one-half percentage point
higher than most private forecasters.
   The administration is counting on faster growth to bring in more
revenues and help it lower the budget deficit without resorting to
higher taxes.
   On the question of interest rates, the business economists see
short-term rates hitting a peak of 8.5 percent this year and then
beginning to decline to 7.8 percent by the end of 1989.
   The administration is forecasting substantially lower rates for
this year, a projection that also makes the deficit look smaller on
paper because it lowers government borrowing costs.
   On other topics, the business economists said:
   _Unemployment will show little change this year because of the
generally sluggish outlook for growth. The jobless rate should
average 5.5 percent for the whole year, up slightly from the 5.4
percent unemployment rate recorded in January.
   _Inflation will worsen this year with consumer prices climbing by
4.8 percent, compared to increases of 4.4 percent in both 1987 and
1988.
   _The merchandise trade deficit, whicllion last year, will continue
improving but at a slower rate
in 1989, falling by 12 percent to $120 billion.
   The business economists generally supported Bush's stand that the
budget deficit should be reduced primarily by cutting government
spending. Only 15 percent of those surveyed said they believed tax
increases should be emphasized over spending cuts although a larger
group said they would be willing to accept a package of tax
increases and spending cuts.
   A large majority of economists, 72 percent, singled out
reductions in farm subsidies as the most fruitful place to look for
savings, followed by cuts in military spending, favored by 55
percent, and reductions in cost-of-living increases fosupported by 47 percent
of those surveyed.
   On the tax side, 71 percent of economists said they would favor
an increase in the gasoline tax followed by 51 percent who said
government user fees should be raised.
   The economic projections were based on a survey of 69 economists
who make up the association's economic forecasting panel. The
assessments of budgetary and monetary policy came from a broader
survey of nearly 300 of the association's members.

   Organizers hope an exhibition opening
Wednesday of 26 centuries of Chinese art will propel this central
Ohio city into the cultural major leagues.
   ``It's a major statement, showing that Columbus can back its
cultural exhibitions,'' said Dorothy Brownley, who helped raise more
than $3.3 million for the exhibit titled ``Son of Heaven: Imperial
Arts of China.''
   The display of 225 pieces of Chinese art and artifacts dating to
the 4th century B.C. runs through Sept. 4.
   Some say the fanfare surrounding the show could generate support
for other, large-scale art exhibitions.
   ``This city is entering into a larger arena for the arts,'' said
Merribell Parsons, the exhibit's director and head of the Columbus
Museum of Art.
   The show features objects from the palaces of 2,600 years of
Chinese emperors and kings. They were lent mostly by museums in
Beijing and eight Chinese provinces.
   Included are life-sized terra-cotta horses and warrior sculptures
from the tomb of China's first emperor; 2,500-year-old cooking
vessels and temple bells; delicate scroll paintings from the 15th
century; and a 2nd-century jade burial suit.
   Some of the items were found in recent archeological digs in
China, Ms. Parsons said.
   ``Son of Heaven'' was China's term for its emperors, believed to
be the human link to Heaven.
   ``It's a very, very important record of Chinese cultural history
and its art,'' Washington University art professor Robert Thorp said
recently. Thorp helped lead the collaboration of the Chinese
government and a U.S. organizing committee that created the exhibit.
   The importance of ``Son of Heaven'' hasn't been lost on Columbus.
   More than a week before the opening, about 85,000 tickets had
been sold at $4.50 to $12.50, said exhibit spokeswoman Pat Cramer.
   Columbus schoolchildren were learning ancient Chinese history to
prepare for field trips, and Ohio State University added a series of
``Son of Heaven'' lectures to its continuing education curriculum.
   A downtown department store since last fall has devoted a section
of its first floor to ``Son of Heaven'' sweatshirts, T-shirts and
mugs.
   An empty downtown school was loaned by the city and converted for
the show into a five-gallery, 40,000-square-foot exhibition hall. It
even contains a cafeteria for visitors and a hospitality suite for
donors.
   Not that the arts generally go ignored in Columbus, a city of
slightly more than half a million that supports a professional
orchestra, ballet company, opera company and theater troupe.
   But this exhibition has been compared to the ``Treasures of
Tutankhamun,'' the ancient Egyptian collection that drew millions of
vistors during a U.S. tour that included Chicago more than a decade
ago.
   The success of ``Tut'' may have helped generate support for
later, major exhibits in Chicago, including a display of Pompeiian
art at the Art Institute and another Egyptian show that opened at
the Field Museum of Chicago last November, said that museum's
Egyptian consultant, Frank Yurco.
   The Field Museum sold 47,000 new memberships during ``Tut's''
four-month stay there in 1977, said spokewoman Barbara Scott.
   Organizers in Columbus hope to capitalize on a similar wave of
public interest to draw at least 500,000 visitors to ``Son of
Heaven.'' Proceeds must meet an estimated $6.35 million in expenses,
they say.
   About 500,000 people saw ``Son of Heaven'' last year in Seattle _
the show's only other stop in the United States.
   As for future projects in Columbus, who knows?
   The Columbus Museum of Art is toying with the idea of trying to
raise $60 million to $80 million for an expansion by the year 2000.
   ``It's possible,'' Ms. Parsons said. ``After this (exhibit), I
really think it's possible.''

   Tom Seaver is back in the rotation. It won't be
on the mound, though. It'll be in the TV booth.
   NBC, the lame duck network of baseball's ``Game of the Week,''
announced Monday that the former New York Mets pitching star will be
its top color commentator this year, joining play-by-play man Vin
Scully.
   ``I used to practice on the days I didn't pitch,'' Seaver said of
his broadcasting. ``Some days I wished that I did do it on the days
I was pitching, too.''
   Seaver has been out of baseball since the end of the 1986 season.
In the summer of 1987 he tried a comeback with the Mets, but decided
he didn't have enough left in his right arm.
   After this season, the ``Game of the Week'' is no more. CBS,
which takes over baseball in 1990, will show only 12 games during
the season.
   In addition to doing color for NBC, he'll be joining the New York
Yankees broadcast crew this year. Matt Merola, Seaver's agent, said
that deal probably will be wrapped up Tuesday.

   Former U.S. Senator and Gov. A.B. ``Happy''
Chandler claims he only backed winners during his political career.
   ``When I was for 'em and they won, it was because they were
attractive and irresistible, and when they got beat, I beat 'em,''
Chandler said Sunday while promoting his autobiography, ``Heroes,
Plain Folks, and Skunks _ The Life and Times of Happy Chandler,'' at

   ``I never intended to write a book,'' said the 90-year-old
Chandler, who is confined to a wheelchair.
   It was Vance Trimble, former editor of The Kentucky Post, who
convinced the former legislator and major league baseball
commissioner to tell his story.
   ``This is Chandler's own story,'' said Trimble, who wrote the
book with Chandler. ``He just reeled it off and I think I was able
to get his cadence and his personality down.''

   The State Department said Monday the peace plan
offered by Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte represents
``the most significant opportunity ever'' for a settlement to that
country's nine-year-old conflict.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman spoke after Duarte accepted
on Sunday a proposal by the FMLN rebel group for direct talks and
said negotiations should begin Tuesday accompanied by a three-month
cease-fire.
   ``In our judgment, this is potentially the most significant
opportunity ever for peace in El Salvador, particularly the
commitment of the government of El Salvador to undertake a cessation
of hostilities if the FMLN agrees within 48 hours,'' Redman said.
   He called on the FMLN to follow the government's example and
``immediately stop the killing so that the political process can
move forward.
   ``The time has come for the FMLN to choose between terrorist
violence and democratic balloting,'' he said.
   Redman added that U.S. officials had consulted with Salvadoran
officials about the proposal but that the plan was not imposed on
the Salvadorans.
   In a nationwide television and radio speech Sunday night, Duarte
also addressed the guerrillas' offer to participate in and accept
the results of the presidential election if it is postponed for at
least four months.
   He advocated postponing the vote, which is scheduled for March
19, until April 30 and proposed that a referendum be held on the
issue if the government and rebels cannot resolve it in talks.
   There have been no direct talks between the government and the
guerrillas since October 1987. Duarte proposed that the talks be
held in Guatemala.

   The judge in Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra
trial abruptly adjourned the proceedings today during a dispute over
the use of classified information during cross examination of
witness Robert W. Owen.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell sent the jury home for the
rest of the day and cleared the courtroom to hold a closed hearing
on the classified information at issue.
   The adjournment came after a heated bench conference during which
the judge was overheard telling prosecutors, ``my ruling is the name
must come in,'' indicating the dispute involved disclosing the name
of a secret source.
   The dispute arose as Owen, who was North's courier to Central
America, was being questioned about a 1985 trip he took to Costa
Rica to view the site of an airfield for rebel resupply operations.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' a clearly angry Gesell told jurors, ``I
am going to excuse you for the day and try to get this roadblock
straightened out.''
   The dispute arose before the noon lunch break when defense
attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. proposed introducing a document
into evidence as part of his cross-examination of Owen.
   The judge asked to see the document over the lunch hour. When the
trial reconvened, Gesell apparently ruled during a bench conference
that the information was relevant to the case, prompting a half-hour
recess while prosecutors consulted with government security experts.
   Another bench conference ensued when court reconvened after the
recess. Gesell spoke to prosecutor John W. Keker so angrily that his
voice could be heard at times in the rear of the courtroom.
   ``I have offered you an opportunity to withdraw the witness,''
the judge was overheard telling Keker.
   Later he told Keker: ``I am willing to try to help you get a
stipulation'' to facts that would be brought out in defense
cross-examination.
   Earlier in the day, Owen said that as Congress was cutting off
aid to the Contras, North called himself the Reagan administration's
``point man'' for helping the Nicaraguan rebels and its ``fall guy''
if things went awry.
   North said ``he was to be, in essence, the point man,'' said
Robert W. Owen, who ferried intelligence reports, tacital advice and
money from the White House aide to the Contras.
   The conversation occurred in the spring of 1984 when Congress
banned military aid to the Contras, Owen said.
   ``He was to be the one responsible for keeping the Nicaraguan
Resistance alive,'' Owen told jurors as the second week of testimony
in North's trial got under way in U.S. District Court.
   North told him ``he was going to be the one to take
responsibility, in essence, to protect those who were higher than he
in the government,'' Owen said under questioning by defense attorney
Brendan V. Sullivan Jr.
   Owen quoted North as saying ```the scenario had been arranged and
OK'd through my superiors in the government' and I believe he said
Bill Casey'' _ the late CIA director.
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and former National
Security Council aide, faces 12 felony charges stemming from his
involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The charges, which carry a maximum penalty of 60 years'
imprisonment upon conviction, include allegations that North lied to
Congress about his covert support of the rebels when such aid was
banned by the so-called Boland Amendments, first enacted in 1984.
   To blunt charges that North's conduct was illegal, the defense is
trying to show that he acted at all times with the express authority
of top administration officials, including President Reagan.
   Owen said that throughout their two-year association, North would
often consult with Casey. He said that during visits to the Old
Executive Office Building he would, on occasion, see Casey emerge
from North's office as he was going in.
   North would talk on the telephone with Casey and other CIA
officials while he was in the office, Owen said.
   ``My name was never mentioned, but there were discussions about
what he was doing,'' Owen said. These discussions with CIA officials
included obtaining intelligence maps and the possible reassignment
of someone involved in the resistance movement, he added.
   Owen said the maps he carried to the Contra rebels came from
``across the river'' _ the euphemism used by Washington officials
for the CIA.
   Owen said he made an agreement with independent counsel Lawrence
E. Walsh to cooperate with the investigation and receive immunity
from prosecution even though he didn't think he had broken any laws
helping the Contras.
   ``I wouldn't suggest I intended to be a witness in this case but
I certainly signed the agreement,'' Owen said, expressing his
support for North.

<HEAD>Hungary Denounces Human Rights Violations in Romania, Backs Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Hungary accused its Warsaw pact ally Romania of
grave human rights violations and said Monday it will join Western
countries calling for the United Nations to investigate the
situation.
   It is believed to be the first time a communist country urges the
world body to investigate alleged abuses in another East bloc state.
   ``We are concerned that human rights and fundamental freedoms
are, in our judgment, gravely violated in Romania and this judgment
is shared by many other countries,'' Hungarian Deputy Foreign
Minister Gyula Horn told the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
   ``We are convinced that meeting the requirement of respect for
human rights is irrespective of a country's belonging to a system of
alliance and its social system,'' he told the 43-nation commission.
   Hungary's proposals to deal with the problem bilaterally with
Romania had brought no results, so the country is ready to
co-sponsor a resolution initiated by Sweden that urges the United
Nations to appoint a special investigator into Romania's human
rights situation, Horn said.
   He cited alleged violations ranging from the demolition of
villages and destruction of cultural and historic values to forced
assimilation of minorities and curbs on religious freedom.
   At a news conference after his address, Horn said Hungary did not
consult the Soviet Union or its other communist allies before making
its decision.
   In December, Hungary became the first communist country to ratify
a key human rights protocol allowing citizens to address individual
complaints of alleged rights violations to a U.N. panel.
   Hungary also was the first communist state to decide Friday to
ratify a 1951 convention defining rights of refugees.
   According to Hungarian statistics, about 15,000 Romanians have
sought asylum in neighboring Hungary, most of them illegally
crossing the border.
   Horn said 85 percent of refugees are ethnic Hungarians, although
arrivals include members of German and other minorities, as well as
Romanians.
   Some stretches of the 186-mile border are virtually unguarded,
while guards are posted every 100 yards at other areas, he said.
   Horn was asked about the fate of refugees who are caught.
   ``There are some who never reappear,'' he said. ``They are those
who are heavily beaten. There are all kinds of punishments.'' But he
added he was not aware of any shooting.
   In London, British journalist Sue Lloyd-Roberts said she and
colleague Vivian Roberts were arrested four times for clandestinely
photographing areas of Romania allegedly wrecked by President
Nicolae Ceausescu's modernization plans.
   She smuggled out her footage, broadcast Monday in Britain, by
hiding it in her underwear. The footage showed empty, brick-strewn
fields where three villages had stood until last fall.
   ``Ceausescu wants to create his `Communist Man,' and he has to
destroy the Romanian village because that's where the opposition to
communism is total,'' said Romanian emigre leader Ion Rativ. The
report said people spoke of villagers being killed resisting
eviction.
   The demolitions are part of Ceausescu's plan to raze 7,000 of
Romania's 13,000 villages and resettle people in so-called
agro-industrial centers.
   An unidentified woman was shown describing what happened: ``They
destroyed everyone's home. My house was knocked to the ground.
They've made us live in new blocks. Everything is wretched and
miserable. What can be done?''

   Phyllis McGrady, former executive producer of
``The Barbara Walters Specials,'' has been named executive producer
of the ``Sam and Diane Show,'' a new ABC News prime-time program to
be co-anchored by Diane Sawyer and Sam Donaldson.
   ABC News also announced Monday that Dorrance Smith, who had been
in charge of weekend news and helped create ``This Week with David
Brinkley'' has been promoted to executive in charge of long form
programming, a title that had belonged to ABC News Vice President Av
Westin.
   Westin's contract is up at the end of March. ABC News spokeswoman
Elise Adde said negotiations are continuing, and ``we are hopeful he
will maintain a relationship with us in the future.'' Westin
continues producing ABC's ``Burning Questions'' documentary series.
The former ``20-20'' executive producer got into hot water two years
ago when he wrote a report criticizing the management of the news
division under Roone Arledge.
   Westin remains vice president for program development, but Smith
will participate in the development of the as-yet-untitled,
prime-time program, nicknamed the ``Sam and Diane Show,'' which is
slated to go on the air sometime this summer, probably in August.
   Sawyer was recently hired away from CBS where she had been a
correspondent on ``60 Minutes.'' ABC also recently hired
correspondent Chris Wallace away from NBC to be the new program's
chief correspondent.
   Ms. McGrady joined the news division in September 1988 after two
years as executive producer of ``The Barbara Walters Specials,'' and
prior to that, two years as executive producer of ``Good Morning
America.''
   Smith has been with ABC News for 12 years, the last nine as
executive producer of weekend news programming.

<TEXT>
   Israel Dvorine, an optometrist who was the first
American to develop a test for colorblindness, has died. He was 89.
   Dvorine, who practiced optometry in the Baltimore area for more
than 40 years, died Friday.
   He never graduated from high school, but after working in an
optical lab he attended the Pennsylvania College of Optometry where
he earned a doctor of optometry degree in the late 1920s.
   Dvorine was most noted for the design and publication of a set of
``pseudo-isochromatic plates,'' charts with a series of colored dots
used to test for colorblindness.
   His test, which involved 11 years of research, was the first by
an American and remains in use.
   Dvorine also did early research on strabismus, or crossed eyes,
which led to development of stereoscopic charts used to train
children in proper eye movement.
   In 1983, he was named the national optometrist of the year by the
American Optometric Association.
   He also was a sculptor and was commissioned by the American
Jewish Historical Society to sculpt more than 40 American Jewish
Nobel Prize recipients.
   He is survived by two sons, a sister and four grandchildren.
   A private funeral was scheduled Tuesday, with burial in Ohr
Knesseth Israel Anshe Sfard Congregation Cemetery.

   Student radicals with firebombs battled
riot police Monday in Seoul and five other cities to protest
President Bush's visit to South Korea.
   No serious injuries were reported, but dissidents said about 70
people were detained.
   A major clash broke out in Seoul when about 700 radical students
and dissidents, throwing rocks and firebombs, battled riot police
around Dongguk University.
   ``Bush go home!'' and ``Down with military dictatorship!''
protesters shouted, as they began a march to the U.S. Embassy, three
miles away.
   The protesters, carrying red and blue flags, tried to march into
the streets after a rally on campus, where they burned effigies of
Bush and South Korean President Roh Tae-woo. Marchers beating drums
led the procession.
   ``Drive out the imperialist Yankees and their military regime!''
a radical leader screamed. Protesters applauded and took up the
chant.
   Other radical leaders denounced Bush and the United States,
charging that Washington keeps troops in South Korea to enforce a
colonial-style rule. About 42,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South
Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   Dozens of protesters surged from the pack and hurled firebombs at
riot police, touching off vicious fighting that lasted 45 minutes.
Several officers were set afire after being hit by firebombs, but
the flames were extinguished quickly.
   Bush, in Seoul for a brief visit on his way home from China and
Japan, moved around the capital by helicopter and was not near the
violence. The government mobilized 20,000 riot police in central
Seoul to block protests.
   Anti-Americanism was a casual subject in the conversation between
Bush and Roh before they started formal talks, and Bush asked why
even a small number of Korean students staged violent protests,
officials said.
   Roh replied there is a small group of radicals who subscribe to
communist ideology and class struggle, the officials said. There
also is a group of people who believe South Korea is subservient to
the United States, they said.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, hundreds of radicals fought with
riot police firing tear gas. Clashes also were reported in Kunsan,
Taegu, Pusan and Chongju.
   Police broke up an attempt by prominent dissident leaders to
march to the U.S. Embassy to deliver a letter addressed to Bush
demanding an end to the U.S. military presence in South Korea.
   About 15 dissident leaders shouting slogans and carrying pictures
of Bush with red crosses drawn through them were hauled away after
trying to assemble about a block from the embassy in downtown Seoul.
   ``No Bush visit!'' the small band shouted before they were
overwhelmed by charging police, who kicked and punched some of the
protesters.
   Minutes after the protest, Bush's helicopter passed overhead on
its way to the presidential mansion, the Blue House, to meet Roh.
   Hundreds of riot police ringed the U.S. Embassy and other U.S.
facilities because of radicals' threats to hold anti-American
protests. Police stepped up street checks on pedestrians downtown.
   The letter to Bush, released by the nation's main dissident
alliance, called for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from South
Korea and charged that Washington ruled the nation like a colony.
   ``U.S.A. is the source of all suppression and sorrow to Korean
people since the division of the Korean peninsula,'' the letter said.
   The letter accused the United States of dividing the Korean
peninsula and keeping troops in South Korea to prevent its
reunification with North Korea. It also denounced Washington for
seeking greater access for U.S. imports to South Korea.
   Radicals say Roh's government is a military dictatorship
controlled by the United States.
   Radical students have little public support because of their
violent and extreme views, but they can assemble thousands of
activists and often clash with riot police.

<HEAD>Priest Offers $100 Bounty For Handguns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE WHEELAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A priest who announced at Mass that he would pay
$100 for every handgun turned in at his church said Monday that
calls are pouring in and he has four guns in hand already.
   Three of the four people who acted on Sunday's offer have turned
down the $100, the Rev. Marshall Gourley added.
   This is Gourley's second effort to rid his flock of firearms.
Last year, he urged his parishioners at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church
in north Denver to turn in their handguns, and had 12 takers from
the parish of 1,800 people.
   This time, he thought a financial incentive might make the
program more successful.
   ``One of the things people mentioned a year ago is that people
had made a financial investment in their guns and asking them to
simply give them up might be asking too much,'' Gourley said.
   So he set aside more than $2,000 donated to the church recently
by a parishioner who had told him to use the money for something
other than church repairs or the church budget.
   ``It seemed maybe we could turn the money given to us for use as
fertilizer and maybe have the tree produce more fruit,'' he said.
   Gourley said his Roman Catholic parish has held about one funeral
a month for gunshot victims over the past year, but it was two
recent funerals _ for a shooting victim and a suicide _ that
prompted him to offer money for guns.
   Over the years, Gourley's parish also has sheltered Central
American refugees, the homeless and victims of abuse.
   ``Anything that strikes at human dignity is something we try to
address,'' he said. ``Guns certainly meet that criterion. The
suffering they inflict on people certainly strikes at human dignity
and the very value of life itself.''
   Gourley made his pitch at four Masses on Sunday, saying the Holy
Spirit had moved him to offer money for guns.
   ``Some people were a little surprised,'' he said. ``Not everyone
was in agreement with our reaction to the whole menace of guns in
our society. But there are a great many people who are supportive,
too.''
   Four handguns were turned in Sunday, with only one person
accepting the $100. ``And from telephone calls in the last half
hour, three or four more are on the way,'' Gourley said.
   Gourley said the handguns will be turned over to police to be
destroyed.
   ``We have enough money now to buy 20 or 25 guns,'' he said.
``When we get to the point where we don't have any money, we'll see
if we can find money, or go down to the mall and sing and dance and
take up a collection.''
   ``I will ask for donations from gun shops and funeral homes. They
have been making a lot of money lately.''
   One parishioner asked Gourley if people might not ``go out and
dig up guns just to get the $100.
   ``I said, `Fine, take advantage of me. That's one less gun. Is a
human life worth $100? Are the bitter tears of a mother worth
$100?'''

   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz's last hope of
cutting short his jail term ended Monday when the Supreme Court
upheld his gun possession conviction in the shooting of four
teen-agers on a subway.
   ``It looks like this is the end of the line,'' said Mark Baker,
Goetz's co-counsel. ``Hopefully, he'll get early parole and that'll
be the end of the criminal matter.''
   Goetz, 41, becomes eligible for parole Sunday after serving 51
days of a one-year sentence stemming from the Dec. 22, 1984,
shootings, said Ruby Ryles of the Correction Department.
   The Supreme Court, without comment, rejected arguments that Goetz
was denied a fair trial because a judge told jurors they ``must'' _
rather than ``may'' _ convict him if they found that the illegal
possession charge had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
   Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Manhattan District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau, said the prosecutor would not comment.
   Baker said he had spoken with Goetz last week, and Goetz had
anticipated the ruling would go against him.
   Goetz, who also was fined $5,000, began serving his sentence at
Rikers Island on Jan. 13 and also spent time in prison upon his
arrest.
   Supporters portrayed Goetz as a hero while detractors labeled him
a vigilante and a racist. Goetz is white. The four teen-agers he
shot are black.
   Goetz was acquitted of attempted murder, assault and reckless
endangerment in 1987, and convicted on just a single weapons
possession count.

   The ``gumbo'' clay of central Louisiana is
wearing out the brakes on the new $25,000 all-terrain vehicles the
Army is buying to replace the venerable jeep.
   Army posts around the world are using the new High Mobility
Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle, but the brake problem appears unique
to those used at Fort Polk, said post spokesman Orina Fulton.
   About 10 percent of the post's 700 HMMWVs are showing premature
wear on the brake pads, Fulton said. The vehicles were delivered in
July and brake trouble showed up in December, he said.
   He blamed the thick gumbo clay _ so called because of its soft,
sticky consistency _ that is common in Louisiana.
   ``If you're familiar with Fort Polk and the surrounding areas, it
looks like sand on top, but underneath you've got soft, red clay,''
Fulton said. ``The soil gets onto the brake pads and is staying
there.''
   Jeeps had no trouble with the clay because they had enclosed drum
brakes. The new vehicle, described as a larger, wider version of the
jeep, has exposed disc brakes, Fulton said.
   The vehicle, nicknamed the Hummer, is manufactured in Mishawaka,
Ind., by AM General Corp., a division of the LTV Missiles &amp;
Electronics Group.
   AM General is testing a new system that would alleviate the
problem, he said.

<HEAD>State Department Criticizes PLO Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Monday that the
Palestine Liberation Organization ``cannot escape responsibility''
for an attack by three guerrillas on Israeli soldiers and Christian
militiamen in southern Lebanon.
   Spokesman Charles E. Redman said the U.S. administration would
``convey this message'' at its next meeting with PLO representatives
in Tunisia.
   The guerrillas were from the Democratic Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, which claimed three Israeli soldiers and two Christian
militiamen were killed. Israeli authorities said the guerrillas'
mission was a raid on Israel and that there were no fatalities
before they were gunned down.
   The group is considered a radical faction, but Redman stressed it
is part of the PLO, which would be held accountable by the U.S.
government.
   ``The PLO cannot escape responsibility for the actions of its
constituent elements,'' the spokesman said.
   Redman added: ``We have made it clear to the PLO that these kinds
of operations have a negative impact on the U.S.-PLO dialogue and on
the atmosphere necessary for a positive Palestinian-Israeli
dialogue. We do not condone this type of activity.''
   The State Department spokesman and then Secretary of State James
A. Baker III were also harshly critical of the PLO for an earlier
clash involving two other PLO factions in southern Lebanon. But
there is no indication the Bush administration will break off talks
with Chairman Yasser Arafat's organization.
   Begun last December by the Reagan administration, the talks were
based on a pledge by Arafat to renounce terrorism and accepting
Israel's right to exist.
   Several U.S. officials, including Richard W. Murphy, then the
assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs, said the
dialogue would be suspended if the PLO engaged in terrorism.
   But Baker said on Feb. 11, after the first incident, ``we are not
prepared at this time to say this constitutes action by the PLO to
cause us to break off the dialogue.''
   At the same time, he said Robert Pelletreau, the U.S. ambassador
to Tunisia, had informed PLO officials that ``actions such as this _
directed against civilian or military targets, inside or outside of
Israel _ were something that gave us trouble.''
   Pelletreau has had four meetings with PLO representatives since
the Reagan administration ended a 13-year ban on dealing with the
Arafat organization.
   ``There is going to be a meeting on that subject, but as for
timing, I really don't have anything yet,'' Redman said, referring
to the incident last Thursday about a mile north of the Israeli
border.
   Meanwhile, William B. Quandt, a former National Security Council
analyst who is now a scholar with the Brookings Institution, said
the talks with the PLO had fallen short of PLO expectations and U.S.
promises.
   Quandt, who met recently with Arafat and other PLO officials in
Tunis, said they were ``a bit frustrated and disappointed with the
virtual non-existence of the U.S.-PLO dialogue.''
   He said at a news conference: ``They had been promised at the
time the dialogue began there would be substantive talks. There have
been virtually none.''
   Asked about Quandt's account, Redman said he ``couldn't speak to
someone else's expectations.''
   The spokesman said the decision to talk to the PLO ``was made at
the end of the previous administration, and we're now in the early
stages of a new administration. But beyond that, I don't really have
any way to interpret somebody else's expectations.''
   On another subject, Redman offered the State Department's
``warmest congratulations'' to Egypt and Israel on the signing
Sunday of agreements on Taba, a tiny beach enclave on the Red Sea.
   Israel had taken control of Taba when it defeated Egypt in the
1967 Six-Day War and captured the Sinai Peninsula. All of the
territory except for the 750-yard-long resort had been returned as
part of the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries.
   Redman, reading from a statement, said the agreements udner which
Israel is yielding Taba and a hotel it built there were ``a tribute
to the serious and statesmanlike approach adopted by the two
parties.''
   He said the agreements also proved that negotiations worked
between parties of good will.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi's appeal of a 1987
illegal gratuities conviction was rejected Monday by the U.S.
Supreme Court, clearing the way for his imprisonment on a 2{-year
term.
   No surrender date was scheduled. Prosecutors said that after they
received official notification of the ruling, they would send Biaggi
a letter ordering his surrender in two to three weeks.
   Biaggi, 70, who was one of the most decorated police officers in
the city before entering politics, is still appealing a conviction
in another case in which he was sentenced to eight years.
   The Supreme Court, without comment, let stand a lower court
ruling that upheld the September 1987 conviction of Biaggi and
former Brooklyn Democratic boss Meade Esposito.
   In the case, Esposito paid for a Florida vacation for Biaggi and
a companion and arranged to pay for a second one in exchange for the
congressman's efforts on behalf of a Brooklyn ship-repair company
that was a major client of Esposito's insurance firm.
   Biaggi, who for 10 terms represented the Bronx and part of
Westchester County, was forced to resign from office last Aug. 5
following another conviction on racketeering charges in the Wedtech
case.
   He was sentenced to eight years in prison in that case, which
involved charges that he illegally took $1.8 million in stocks and
cash from Wedtech Corp., a now-defunct defense contractor in the
Bronx.
   Biaggi is appealing the Wedtech conviction.
   ``We are very disappointed,'' said a Biaggi attorney, John
Pollok, of the Supreme Court ruling. ``We would have preferred the
court to consider some of the issues which we considered very
important.''
   Biaggi was convicted of accepting gratuities for official acts
and obstruction of justice, and Esposito was convicted of giving the
gratuities.
   Esposito was sentenced to two years probation and 500 hours of
community service. Each man also was fined $500,000.

<HEAD>USDA Says China Authorized to Buy U.S. Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has been authorized to buy an additional
2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg said the wheat will be
available to China under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to
36.7 bushels of wheat.
   Under EEP arrangement, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The subsidies have ranged from less than $20 to more than $40 per
ton of wheat, or in the range of 54 cents to $1.09 per bushel.
   Under previous EEP authorizations, China has bought more than 7.4
million tons of wheat for delivery in 1988-89. Only 10,000 tons
remained in the previous authorization issued on Dec. 30.
   China is the biggest foreign customer of American wheat farmers
this year, and also expected to be the world's largest single
importer of wheat in 1988-89.
   According to USDA projections, China may import about 15 million
tons of wheat from all foreign sources, while the Soviet Union is
expected to import 13 million tons.
   The Soviets, as of Feb. 23, had bought about 3 million tons of
wheat from the United States, compared with the 7.4 million tons by
China. All of the 1988-89 U.S. wheat sales to the Soviet Union and
China have been subsidized.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities shot up in Monday's auction with the rate on three-month
bills rising to the highest level in more than four years.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 8.73 percent, up from 8.51 percent last
week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 8.77 percent, up from 8.5 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 8.82
percent on Nov. 5, 1984, and six-month bills averaged 8.86 percent
on March 3, 1985.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 9.05 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,779.30 and 9.3 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,556.60.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 9.41
percent last week, up from 9.27 percent the previous week.

   The government said Monday it resented the United
States having invited a leading dissident to a banquet given by
President Bush, and regretted that a fuss was made when police
barred him from attending.
   Chinese intellectuals, meanwhile, said the action against Fang
Lizhi was ``stupid,'' ``neolithic'' and ``unacceptable.''
   Fang, an internationally respected astrophysicist who has
criticized Marxism and called for democratic reform in China, was
invited to the banquet along with his wife, Li Shuxian.
   But dozens of police converged to block his car and bar him from
entering the hotel where the Texas-style barbecue was held Sunday.
Police then refused to allow him to ride in a taxi and made a bus
driver pass a stop where he was waiting.
   ``All the arrangements concerning President Bush's stay in China
had been agreed upon by both sides beforehand,'' the official Xinhua
News Agency said, quoting an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman.
   ``The U.S. side, without consulting the Chinese side, invited
Fang to attend the dinner, which was especially in honor of Chinese
leaders. Therefore, the Chinese side resented this,'' the spokesman
said.
   Visiting world leaders generally hold banquets for their Chinese
hosts, but it would be highly unusual for them to submit the guest
list for Chinese approval
   ``Some people'' are trying to ``make an issue'' of Fang's
absence, said the Foreign Ministry spokesman.
   ``We feel sorry that such a thing should happen,'' Xinhua quoted
the spokesman as saying.
   Bush told Vice Premier Wu Xueqian at the airport he regretted the
actions that kept Fang away.
   At Bush's direction, U.S. Ambassador Winston Lord met with Vice
Foreign Minister Zhu Qizhen later and ``reiterated the regret that
the president had expressed,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman McKinney
Russell.
   Russell said Lord also asked for ``clarification of what the
circumstances were.''
   Fang told reporters Monday that Bush's statement of regret was
``a beginning'' but added: ``I hope they (the Americans) say
something more in the next few days.''
   ``Regarding the United States I have a principled criticism: I
want it to adopt a single standard toward human rights and not a
double standard,'' he said. ``I think there are indeed some double
standards'' in the United States' open criticism of the Soviet
Union's human rights record but not China's.
   But Fang added, ``Of course, we Chinese must win our own human
rights for ourselves.''
   Bush did not raise human rights issues during his two days of
meetings with Chinese leaders. However, senior leader Deng Xiaoping
and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang stressed that
domestic stability is more important now than democratic reform.
   Zhao said dissident demands for ``multiparty and parliamentarian
politics'' in China are unrealistic under current conditions and
will only undermine efforts to reform the nation's central planning
economic system.
   However, Fang said, ``Only after democracy is achieved can the
reforms be carried out. People must independently supervise the
government.''
   ``I can't change my views because of fear,'' he said, pledging to
continue speaking out. He said many fellow intellectuals telephoned
him Monday to express support.
   Bei Dao, a poet, said he was worried that the incident could be
the prelude to a political crackdown after a period of relative
cultural freedom.
   ``I was all ready to go back to my work and forget about
politics,'' he said. ``But if this is how they are openly
interfering in human rights, then I must fight back.''
   Bei is the author of a recent open letter signed by 100 others
who called for the release of political prisoners. The letter echoed
an earlier one, written by Fang in January.
   Dai Qing, a leading journalist who attended the banquet, said she
was shocked by the news.
   ``Their methods are neolithic,'' she said. ``Our government has
changed so much for the better, it was pitiful for them to do this
now.''
   Fang gained fame in 1986 with eloquent speeches to college
students in which he called for democracy and human rights.
   Authorities blamed him for a nationwide wave of student
demonstrations in the winter of 1986-87 and expelled him from the
Communist Party. They barred him this year from traveling to the
United States to attend a scientific conference and teach.

<HEAD>Army Says Warrant Officer to Face Court-Martial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Army warrant officer accused of spying for
the Warsaw Pact has waived his right to a grand jury-type proceeding
and will face an immediate court-martial starting next week, the
service said Monday.
   The case has been referred to trial as a ``non-capital case,''
however, meaning if convicted the maximum punishment would be life
in prison, the Army added.
   Warrant Officer James W. Hall, 30, of New York City, was arrested
Dec. 21 near Savannah, Ga., after allegedly admitting to an FBI
undercover agent that he had been passing classified intelligence
information to the Soviets and East Germans for the past six years.
   On Jan. 4, Hall was formally charged with 10 counts of espionage,
attempted espionage and failing to obey regulations.
   The Army has asserted that Hall, an intelligence analyst with a
top secret security clearance, delivered exposed film and documents
dealing with ``communications intelligence, a means of defense or
retaliation against large-scale attack, war plans and military
satellites.''
   At the time of his arrest, Hall was assigned to the 24th Infantry
Division and worked as an intelligence analyst in the Army's G-2
intelligence section. He joined the Army in September 1976 and spent
most of his career working in Europe as an analyst of intercepted
radio and telephone traffic and coded messages.
   Legally, Hall could have insisted the Army conduct a so-called
Article 32 hearing _ a proceeding that resembles a civilian grand
jury hearing to determine if a court-martial is warranted.
   The soldier decided to waive that hearing, however, ``and the
court-martial of Warrant Officer Hall will convene on March 6, 1989,
at Fort McNair, Washington, D.C.,'' the Army added.
   ``It is anticipated that Hall, as is his right, will request to
be tried by judge alone. He will be tried by Military Judge Col.
Howard C. Eggers, the chief of the United States Army Trial
Judiciary.''
   It was not immediately clear why the case against Hall was being
referred to trial as a non-capital case.
   Under a revision to the Uniform Code of Military Justice approved
by Congress several years ago, the most serious espionage cases can
be tried as capital cases with the death penalty as maximum
punishment.
   The Army said Monday that much of the proceeding involving Hall
would be closed to the media and public because of the classified
nature of the evidence.

   Robert Owen, who shuttled from Washington to
Central America with help for the Contra fighters, said in a 1986
memo that rebel leader Adolfo Calero surrounded himself with
second-rate people who ``are liars and greed and power motivated.''
   The six-page memo from Owen to Oliver North was introduced into
evidence Friday at North's trial and released by the court on
Monday. It was from ``TC'' to ``BG'' _ pseudonyms Owen used for
himself, ``The Courier,'' and North, ``Blood and Guts.''
   ``Perhaps Adolfo Calero is the man to lead Nicaragua back to
democracy,'' Owen wrote North on March 17, 1986, when North was a
National Security Council aide. ``He is a creation of the USG (U.S.
government) and so he is the horse we chose to ride. Have no problem
with this, as long as we know and understand his shortcomings.''
   The best way to do that, Owen said, was to look at the people
Calero trusted.
   ``Unfortunately, they are not first rate people; in fact they are
liars and greed and power motivated. They are not the people to
rebuild a new Nicaragua.''
   Owen said the Democratic National Front, headed by Calero ``has
done a good job of keeping competent people out of the
organization.''
   Calero testified in the trial last week, praising North's efforts
on behalf of the Contras.
   Later in his memo, Owen told North that a coalition of Contra
groups called United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO) ``is a name only''
and ``there is no substance.''
   ``I care and believe in the boys and girls, men and women who are
fighting, bleeding, dying,'' Owen said, contending that few of the
leaders of the movement did.
   ``This war has become a business to many of them; there is still
a belief the Marines are going to have to invade, so let's get set
so we will automatically be the ones put in power,'' he wrote.
   At the end of the memo, Owen said he would like to ``move on''
and get involved in counterterrorism.
   ``I will continue in whatever position you recommend,'' he
concluded. ``You have been my Godfather through this.''

<UNK>Anti-Apartheid Groups Meet ANC to Discuss Winnie Mandela</UNK>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of South Africa's biggest
anti-apartheid groups began talks Monday with African National
Congress leaders on differences over Winnie Mandela, wife of
imprisoned ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
   Thabo Mbeki, information chief of the ANC guerrilla movement,
refused to comment on the talks. He said officials will make a
statement at the end of discussions with the United Democratic Front
and the Congress of South African Trade Unions.
   Jay Naidoo, the union's secretary-general, and Murphy Morobe,
publicity secretary of the front, said they want the guerrilla
movement to clarify its views on the activities of Mrs. Mandela and
the so-called Mandela United soccer team, a group of youths who have
acted as her bodyguards in Johannesburg's black township of Soweto.
   Anti-government groups in South Africa have renounced Mrs.
Mandela and accused her bodyguards of abductions and assaults. Two
Mandela United members have been charged with the killing of a
14-year-old black activist, Stompie Seipei. Mrs. Mandela says it is
a plot to discredit her.
   Internal groups campaigning for an end to South Africa's system
of legal race discrimination, called apartheid, say they want to
isolate Mrs. Mandela.
   The ANC, the main guerrilla organization fighting in South
Africa, urged Mrs. Mandela to disband her bodyguard but said she
should not be shunned. Mrs. Mandela, who has ignored previous
requests to get rid of the guards, last week said she would act on
her husband's instructions and disband them.
   ANC officials have appealed for unity among South Africa's black
majority of 26 million, who have no vote in national affairs.

<TEXT>
   Timothy Haggerty lost to city hall,
lost in state court and on Monday lost in the highest court in the
land, but he vowed he'll continue his $50,000 fight _ over the size
of his mailbox.
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand, without comment, a
lower court ruling that Haggerty's mailbox _ or at least the
15-foot-high structure it was part of _ had to go.
   Haggerty, a towing service mechanic, said from his home the
decision was expected.
   ``Let no one wonder why respect for the legal system is
collapsing,'' he said. ``But it's not over until I give up, and I
haven't given up yet.''
   He said he would consult his attorneys about further action.
   At the city attorney's office, Sharon Delegal, the latest in a
string of lawyers who handled the case, said she hoped the decision
ends the matter.
   ``We're pleased, to say the least,'' Ms. Delegal said. ``The
bottom line was that the structure, which was much bigger than a
mail box, was on public property. The city just felt very
uncomfortable with it.''
   The structure was built in front of his house in the spring of
1982, and within a few months had aroused the wrath of local
officials.
   Anchored by two subterranean truck engine blocks, two water pipes
rose 15 feet in the air. The mail receptacle was attached to a
horizontal bar about three feet above the ground. A second
horizontal bar several feet above the receptacle served as the base
of a flagpole.
   The structure, about six feet wide at its widest point, contained
an old bed frame, part of a golf cart and was topped off by a model
airplane with an ``air mail'' designation.
   About nine months after Haggerty completed it, city officials
told him the mail box violated a city ordinance barring obstructions
in the public right-of-way portion of his property.
   Haggerty said he was initially accused of blocking traffic _
despite the fact that he lives at the end of a dead-end street.
   Haggerty lost a first round in court, and the city removed the
structure. He won on appeal, and built another one _ this time 22
feet tall _ to take its place.
   The city won round three, and Haggerty was forced to remove the
second structure.
   He then sought help from the nation's highest court. His appeal
contended, among other things, that the city ordinance is violating
his freedom of expression.
   Lawyers for the city urged the justices to reject Haggerty's
appeal, arguing that he is free to express himself somewhere else on
his property, off the public right-of-way.

<HEAD>Sheriff's Deputy Charged With Slaying Three Prostitutes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sheriff's deputy was charged with three
counts of murder Monday in the slayings of three prostitutes, and
officials said special circumstance allegations could mean the death
penalty if he is convicted.
   Rickey Ross, 40, a Los Angeles County deputy, was arrested
Thursday for investigation of murder in the slayings in the
gang-infested south-central area of the city.
   Andy Reynolds, a spokesman for the prosecutor, said the
special-circumstance allegations were for multiple murder. Under
California law, a convicted murderer also found guilty of special
circumstance allegations can be put to death rather than sentenced
to life imprisonment.
   Ross, a narcotics investigator with the department for 18 years,
was arrested for investigation of three killings, but published and
broadcast reports have said police are investigating as many as 12
deaths of the south-central district's ``strawberries,'' the street
name for prostitutes who sell sex for drugs.
   Attorney Jay Jaffe, who spoke to Ross on Sunday, said he hoped
police had not rushed to arrest Ross in reaction to criticism of the
department's tactics in investigating the series of prostitute
deaths.
   ``I hope that he is not the scapegoat for what appeared to be
public pressure brought on the police department to come up with a
suspect,'' Jaffe said.
   Some sheriff's department officials had said Sunday that a gun
found in Ross' car, reportedly a 9mm semiautomatic pistol, was so
badly rusted that ballistics experts were having problems positively
linking the weapon to the one used to kill the prostitutes.
   ``This case is going to be made or broken on the ballistics, and
from what we hear, the ballistics are pretty shaky,'' one law
enforcement officer told the Los Angeles Times.
   But the Times quoted another unidentified police investigator who
said a ``positive comparison'' had been made of bullets fired from
the gun taken from the car trunk and those recovered from the bodies
of the three prostitutes.
   ``We wouldn't put an active-duty sheriff's deputy in jail for
homicide on an `iffy' make,'' he said.
   Ross was stopped in the south-central district while driving in a
department car, sitting with an alleged prostitute at his side,
authorities said Friday. The woman told police she and Ross had been
smoking rock cocaine.

<TEXT>
   The attorney for ``Night Stalker'' murder
defendant Richard Ramirez is suffering from trial-related nervous
exhaustion, the judge said Monday, and the prosecutor said they
might have to start the trial over.
   ``Probably the chances of a mistrial are good,'' Deputy District
Attorney P. Philip Halpin said. ``We can't keep this jury hanging
around indefinitely.''
   A mistrial would mean a new jury would need to be selected in the
3{-year-old case.
   Ramirez, 28, is charged with 13 murders and 30 related felonies
in a series of grisly nighttime attacks that terrified Southern
California in the summer of 1985.
   Testimony began Jan. 30 after six months of jury selection.
   A doctor's report submitted to the judge said attorney Daniel
Hernandez is suffering from stress-related nervous exhaustion
resulting from his participation in the long-delayed trial. The
doctor recommended psychological counseling and said recovery could
take six weeks.
   ``The doctor feels he is not presently able to function
effectively as trial counsel,'' said Superior Court Judge Michael
Tynan, who declined to disclose the doctor's name.
   Jurors had been excused since Hernandez called in sick Tuesday.
   ``This is a novel experience for the court,'' said Tynan, adding
that he would hold hearings before he decides on a remedy for the
situation.
   He ordered Hernandez and his former co-counsel, Arturo Hernandez,
no relation, to be in court Wednesday for an inquiry on the state of
Hernandez' health and the trial's future.
   Arturo Hernandez disappeared from the case without public
explanation during jury selection. He remains a counsel of record in
the case, but Halpin said it was unlikely that he would be ordered
to take over for his ailing colleague.
   During the 1985 crime spree, an intruder entered homes at night
through unlocked windows or doors, then raped women, killed men and
women with gunshots to the head, and stole jewelry and other
valuables. One victim's eyes were gouged out, and the killer often
left behind drawings of pentagrams, inverted five-pointed stars
associated with devil worship.
   The press dubbed the killer the ``Night Stalker,'' and people in
the Los Angeles area shut their windows at night despite a heat
wave. Terror spread through the state as related crimes were
reported in San Francisco and Orange County, where charges against
Ramirez are pending.
   Ramirez was arrested after he was chased and beaten by an angry
mob in East Los Angeles during the 1985 Labor Day weekend, when his
picture first appeared in newspapers as the prime suspect in the
crime wave.
   During his 1985 arraignment, Ramirez yelled ``Hail Satan!'' and
flashed a picture of a pentagram drawn on his palm. Several women
testified at his 1986 preliminary hearing that after their husbands
were murdered, they were raped and ordered to ``Swear to Satan.''

<HEAD>Retired Admiral Reimburses Navy for Moving Expenses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A retired four-star Navy admiral has reimbursed
the government $3,400 for using military personnel to help him move
files and other possessions from Honolulu to begin his retirement,
the Navy said Monday.
   The service, in a brief statement, said retired Adm. James A.
``Ace'' Lyons Jr. ``was requested to reimburse the excess costs
incurred by the government'' and has ``voluntarily paid'' $3,420.94
to the Navy.
   The Navy said Lyons made the payment after Navy Secretary William
L. Ball III ``determined that some of the benefits received by Adm.
Lyons upon his retirement exceeded entitlements.''
   Lyons, the former head of the Navy's Pacific Fleet in Honolulu,
Hawaii, left his job on Oct. 1, 1987 on short notice not long after
John F. Lehman resigned as Navy secretary. Lyons' departure also
came soon after he publicly complained about the manner in which the
Navy was overseeing operation of warships assigned to the Persian
Gulf.
   According to the Navy, an anonymous complaint shortly after the
admiral stepped down from active duty alleged that Lyons had
improperly shipped personal property on a military plane.
   The Navy said that Lyons had shipped some personal property on a
Navy plane when he left Honolulu, but that those aircraft flights
had not been ordered just for Lyons' benefit and the ``additional
costs were minimal.''
   He was asked to reimburse the $3,400, however, because the
investigation also found that Lyons had asked ``four military
personnel'' to help him in traveling from Honolulu to Washington to
start his retirement.
   Lyons has said he had only a week's notice to prepare for
retirement and that he did, in fact, ask four servicemen to help him
move his files and other possessions from Hawaii.

<HEAD>North Trial Held Up Over Disclosure of Name</HEAD>

   The judge in Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial
adjourned court abruptly Monday to clear up a ``roadblock'' created
by an apparent defense attempt to reveal a name the government wants
to keep secret.
   It was the first serious disruption of the trial on national
security grounds since the jury was sworn last Tuesday.
   The dispute arose over introduction of a document during
cross-examination of Robert W. Owen, who had acted as North's
courier shuttling maps, money and tactical advice to the rebels
fighting the Sandinista government at a time official U.S. aid was
banned.
   Arguments over use of classified information put the start of the
trial in doubt for weeks, and some or all of the charges could still
be dropped if the Bush administration declares there must be no
disclosure of information that the judge says is needed for North to
have a fair trial.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell did not call the jury into
court after the lunch break, but instead held a 15-minute conference
with lawyers at the bench. He then adjourned court for a half hour,
held another bench conference and declared the trial ready to
proceed. But then prosecution lawyer John Keker objected again.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to excuse you today; I'm going
to get this roadblock straightened out,'' the judge told the jury,
obviously angry.
   Afterward, he met behind closed doors with lawyers in the case
for more than an hour. A spokesman for the court said Owen would be
back on the witness stand when court opens at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday.
   During one bench conference the judge was overheard telling
prosecutors: ``My ruling is the name must come in'' _ indicating the
dispute involved disclosing the name of a source the government
wants to keep secret. He offered the prosecution a chance to avoid
disclosure, saying Owen could be withdrawn as a witness. That would
mean Gesell would have to instruct jurors to ignore Owen's testimony
all day Friday and Monday morning.
   The dispute started before the noon break. Owen was being
questioned about a 1985 trip he took to Costa Rica to view the site
of an airfield for rebel resupply operations. North lawyer Brendan
Sullivan attempted to introduce a document and question him about
it. A private bench conference followed and the judge sent the jury
to lunch early.
   When the trial reconvened, Gesell apparently ruled at a second
bench conference that the defense was entitled to use the
information. The ruling triggered a recess while prosecutors
consulted with administration security experts.
   In the post-recess bench conference, Gesell's agitated voice
could be heard at times in the rear of the courtroom.
   ``I have offered you an opportunity to withdraw the witness,''
the judge told Keker.
   Later he said: ``I am willing to try to help you get a
stipulation.'' A stipulation is an agreement by both sides to a fact
or set of facts, without having to introduce particulars.
   Earlier Monday, Owen testified that North declared in 1984 he
would be the Reagan administration's ``point man'' helping the
Nicaraguan rebels after legal U.S. aid was cut off.
   ``He was going to be the one to take responsibility and in
essence protect those who were higher than he in the government,''
said Owen.
   ``He said, in essence, this scenario had been arranged and OK'd
through my (North's) superiors. And I believe he said Bill Casey
knew about this,'' Owen said, referring to the late CIA director.
   ``He said he would be the point man to keep the Nicaraguans alive
and if things became public, when they went wrong, he would be the
fall guy _ he used those words _ for the administration,'' Owen said.
   Owen, testifying under immunity from prosecution, said he was in
North's office in the White House complex several times when Casey
either came in or was leaving.
   North's defense to many of the 12 criminal charges against him is
that his actions in supplying aid and advice to the Contras _ after
Congress forbade aid by U.S. intelligence agencies and the military
_ were with the knowledge and approval of higher ups, including
then-President Reagan.
   On Monday, Gesell and the lawyers tiptoed around references to
the names of U.S. and foreign officials whose identities could not
be disclosed for national security reasons.
   ``He was a senior official,'' Owen said of one man from CIA
headquarters he met in San Jose, Costa Rica.
   ``Your honor,'' said Sullivan, ``I don't believe the name is
classified. Could I give him the first letter of the last name to
see if it's the same person we are talking about.''
   The judge told Owen to write the name on a piece of paper. He
summoned lawyers to the bench to look at it and after five minutes
told Owen: ``Just refer to this name as `CIA One.'''
   That was joined later by ``Costa Rica No. 1'' and his deputy,
``Costa Rica No. 2.''
   Owen said that he and the CIA station chief in Costa Rica toured
a site for a rebel resupply airfield and that their trip was known
to the U.S. ambassador there.
   That testimony, elicited by Sullivan under cross-examination, was
an example of the defense's attempt to distribute knowledge of
North's dealings among higher officials at a time when U.S. aid was
banned.
   CIA station chief Joseph Fernandez, known as Tomas Castillo, was
indicted on charges he illegally helped North set up the airfield in
Costa Rica and lied to his superiors. That indictment was dismissed
on procedural grounds, but independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has
indicated he will bring the case anew.

   Snow driven by wind blasts of more than
110 mph shut down a pumping station on the trans-Alaska oil pipeline
and halted the flow of oil in the line for several hours during the
weekend, an official said.
   ``It cost some people a lot of sleep,'' said Tom Brennan,
spokesman for the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.
   The wind was part of a huge storm that pounded the Arctic Ocean
coast during the weekend, ripping aluminum roofing from homes in
Barrow and knocking at least one residence off its pilings.
   Brennan said the wind gusted to more than 110 mph at the Prudhoe
Bay oil field.
   One of three pumps at Pump Station One failed Saturday when snow
got into its ventilation system, melted and caused an electrical
short, he said. The station's other two pumps failed that night when
air intakes froze shut on their booster pumps, he said.

   Good things come in threes at Rocky
Haven Farm, where triplet brothers Donald, Robert and John Smith
acted like proud papas after their 1,300-pound Holstein named Candy
gave birth to triplet calves.
   ``I don't know if it's any big thing or not, but it seems kind of
rare,'' said Donald Smith, 35, the eldest of the human siblings by
five minutes.
   David Burrows, the brothers' veterinarian, said cows give birth
to triplets about one in every 50,000 births. Burrows said he
usually sees at least one set of triplet cows a year _ none owned by
triplet farmers.
   The brothers, who live about 10 miles west of Hagerstown in
western Maryland, usually sell bull calves a few days after birth,
but hope they can find a university or feed company to buy the
calves for research, such as testing how triplets grow and respond
to feeding patterns.
   The calves, which were born last week, haven't been named or
tagged, but the Smiths can tell them apart. All are black and white,
but one has a larger black spot on its rump and the youngest of the
trio is the smallest.

   Forget about a roof over your head and three
square meals. America's wealthy these days say they simply can't
survive without their microwave ovens, VCRs and answering machines,
a study shows.
   ``What just a few years ago were clearly novelties or luxuries
have today become necessities of speed and convenience,'' said
William S. Doyle, president of the company that initiated the study
of households with annual incomes above $100,000.
   According to the figures compiled for the Doyle Graf Raj
advertising agency by The Roper Organization:
   _57 percent said they couldn't live without a microwave oven.
   _49 percent called their answering machines a necessity.
   _42 percent absolutely needed their home computers.
   _36 percent considered their videotape recorders indispensable.
   Those four items ranked above such important but apparently
dispensible matters as sending children to an elite college (30
percent) or a private school (25 percent).
   The survey of 600 adults represented 100 households apiece in New
York, Chicago, Washington, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   The study asked the participants to choose between luxuries _
``things they could live without'' _ and necessities _ ``things that
have become so important they are thought to be necessities.''

<HEAD>Canadian Insurer Pays Death Benefits To Terminally Ill Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An insurance executive doing volunteer
work in an AIDS hospice in Toronto last year asked a dying man what
he could do to help, and the patient said he could help him ``die
with a little more dignity.''
   The volunteer, Ron Barbaro, president of the Canadian branch of
Prudential Insurance Co. of America, soon found a way for his
company to pay death benefits to the dying, a program being hailed
by AIDS support groups.
   ``Here was a situation where this young man's parents were in
Europe, and he was alone,'' Barbaro recalled during a recent
telephone interview with the San Jose Mercury News. ``When he died
there would be a fair amount of money _ $20,000 or $25,000 _ and yet
he had nothing right now.''
   Barbaro could do little to help the young man before he died. But
Barbaro, 56, ``vowed that I would find a way to give some living
benefits from our industry'' to other terminally ill patients.
   Working with company lawyers, actuaries and underwriters, he came
up with the first policy to give terminally ill patients _ whether
dying of AIDS or other causes _ part of their benefits before they
die.
   ``We have been looking for a long time to see some leadership
from the insurance industry (in the AIDS crisis), and I think this
is very creative and a tremendous step forward,'' said Leonard
Graff, legal director of National Gay Rights Advocates in San
Francisco. He said he thought ``it's a very generous and caring
thing for them to do.''
   In the past year, hundreds of thousands of dollars have been paid
out, with benefits ranging from 40 percent to 70 percent of the
total benefit depending on the circumstances. The remainder of the
benefits are paid to the beneficiary when the patient dies.
   Gerald Haims, an insurance analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities
in Los Angeles, said the move was not only a humanitarian gesture,
but it ``makes good dollars and cents, too.''
   ``This is something Prudential can really capitalize on,'' said
Haims. ``Can you imagine the appeal in terms of advertising? Not
only would you have an immediate following among gay and lesbian
communities, but every humanitarian out there will be impressed by
it. I'm impressed by it.''
   Barbaro said he has received many inquiries from other insurance
officials in Canada and the United States.
   ``They're looking very seriously at it, because there's no
downside,'' said Barbaro, noting that insurance companies don't lose
money by making payments in advance.
   ``Conventional wisdom has always been that you don't pay a claim
until somebody has died,'' he said. ``But my question was, why not,
if the numbers work out?''
   Joseph V. Vecchione, Prudential's vice president for public
relations in the United States, said the payments are not being made
to policyholders in the U.S. because ``there are many legal
difficulties in this country which would have to be resolved.''
   ``Canadian laws are different and our attorneys there feel we can
proceed,'' he said. ``We will take a close look at what ensues in
Canada.''
   Ben Schatz, director of the group's AIDS Civil Rights Project and
a member of the AIDS advisory committee of the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners, called Prudential's policy ``unique in
the insurance industry'' and said it shows ``profits and compassion
do not necessarily have to conflict.''
   ``We have seen depressingly few creative health approaches coming
out of the insurance industry,'' said Schatz. ``It's nice to see an
exception.''

   The Pentagon is inching closer to several
deadlines for important policy decisions as John Tower's nomination
to become defense secretary founders on Capitol Hill.
   Foremost among those decisions are several involving the 1990
budget.
   While the four military services have prepared recommendations to
achieve the spending cuts promised by Bush, officials would normally
be receiving guidance from a defense secretary by now.
   ``If this drags on much longer, I don't know when we're going to
get a budget,'' observed one official who works in the financial
arena and who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
   Tower's nomination comes before the full Senate Wednesday. The
Armed Services Committee recommended by an 11-9 vote last week that
he not be confirmed.
   ``Is the department functioning? Sure,'' observed one source who
insisted upon anonymity. ``We are awarding contracts every day and
training people to fight every day.
   ``But, without a secretary of defense, we don't have any kind of
new team in the top bureaucratic positions. And that means months of
delays down the road in having people geared up to deal with budget
and policy matters.''
   Beyond the budget problems, the Bush administration is facing
deadlines for policy decisions and debates have begun without the
Pentagon really being represented, said several sources, all of whom
spoke on the condition they not be named.
   For example, Bush is scheduled to report Wednesday his view of a
proposal to develop a limited Star Wars defense system known as the
Accident Launch Protection System. On March 15, the president is to
provide a study of how a new nuclear arms treaty with the Soviets
would affect the structure of U.S. nuclear forces.
   By early May, Bush has promised completion of a special 90-day
national security policy review. And at some point soon, he must
advise Congress whether he wants to develop the single-warhead
Midgetman missile or a rail-car version of the huge MX missile.
   Finally, the administration has pledged to oversee reform of the
Pentagon's weapons-buying process in the wake of the continuing
federal fraud investigation.
   ``We need somebody in the job,'' said one official. ``You can't
muddle through forever.''

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte's
proposal to postpone the presidential election as demanded by
leftist rebels was rejected Monday by the opposition-controlled
legislature.
   In a nationwide television address Sunday, Duarte proposed a
cease-fire and direct negotiations with the insurgents on Tuesday in
Guatemala. He also called for postponing the March 19 election to
April 30 _ a date the rebels have rejected as too early.
   The unicameral Legislative Assembly is controlled by the rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena. The rightists are favored
to win the presidency from Duarte's Christian Democrats, and
adamantly have rejected any postponement of the vote.
   Ricardo Alvarenga, president of the Assembly and an Arena leader,
said at a news conference that ``the election date is set, and it
must be fulfilled. It is not by altering the constitutional order
that problems are resolved.''
   Rebel leader Salvador Samayoa said in an interview that Duarte's
``proposal has problems and evident loopholes, but we will put out a
constructive response, not a negative one.''
   His group, the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front, had originally
called for elections in September, but then said it would accept a
vote in July.
   Duarte's term expires June 1. The 63-year-old Duarte, who is
suffering from terminal liver cancer, is expected to survive until
then.
   The United States had hailed Duarte's proposal.
   ``In our judgment, this is potentially the most significant
opportunity ever for peace in El Salvador, particularly the
commitment of the government of El Salvador to undertake a cessation
of hostilities if the FMLN agrees within 48 hours,'' State
Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington.
   Duarte acknowledged Sunday there would be constitutional problems
with delaying the election, but suggested they could be resolved
either through an accord involving the three branches of government,
or by a plebiscite.
   The FMLN said in January if the election were postponed a
significant time period, it would take part and respect the outcome.
That was seen as a major turnabout by the Marxist-led rebels, who
have boycotted and condemned the five previous national elections
this decade.
   Duarte originally rejected the guerrilla proposal as insincere.
He also had said postponement of the election past March 31 would be
unconstitutional.
   He did not explain Sunday why April 30 could be considered a
legal date. The constitution says elections must be held at least
two months before the end of the incumbent's term.
   Alvarenga opposed the plebiscite proposal.
   ``Why have a plebiscite? The presidential election is a
plebiscite, a consultation of the popular will, and it must be
carried out as scheduled,'' he said.
   He said the legislature must analyze Duarte's proposal.
   Leaders of the Democratic Convergence, a leftist alliance the
guerrillas would support if they took part in the vote, said
Duarte's proposal had good and bad points.
   Convergence leader Ruben Zamora said at a news conference that
direct talks could be productive, but that an April 30 election date
``is not acceptable and does not contribute to peace.''
   The 7,000-member guerrilla army has been fighting the
government's armed force of 56,000 for nine years. The civil war has
ravaged the country and an estimated 70,000 people, most of them
civilians, have been killed.

   EL-BIREH, Occupied West Bank (AP) _ A Palestinian teen-ager
stabbed an Israeli soldier Monday and then was shot in the head and
wounded as troops chased him through a crowded market, the army said.
   Radio reports said the assailant was injured with rubber bullets.
   Also Monday, a previously unknown Arab group claimed it was
holding a paratrooper missing for 12 days.
   In clashes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, soldiers
shot and wounded 10 Palestinians, according to Arab reports and
hospital officials.
   The military commander of the West Bank town of El-Bireh, about
10 miles north of Jerusalem, said a Palestinian youth twice stabbed
an Israeli soldier who was the last man in a routine patrol passing
through a crowded market.
   The commander, a paratrooper colonel indentified only as Chai,
said the soldier shouted ``I'm wounded!'' and ran with other troops
after the 18-year-old attacker.
   As the assailant ran into the market, two soldiers fired and hit
him once in the head and in the neck, Chai said.
   A border police soldier, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the wounded soldier tried to hit his attacker as the two lay
side by side on stretchers, but soldiers separated them.
   The army identified the soldier as Ratib Subakh, a member of
Israel's Arab Druse minority. He was stabbed in the shoulder and was
reported to have suffered minor to moderate wounds.
   His assailant was identified only as being only from Ramallah.
His condition was not reported.
   The attack came three days after a paratrooper was killed in the
West Bank city of Nablus when a large concrete block was dropped on
his head.
   Seventeen Israelis, including six soldiers, have been killed in
violence since December 1987 when Palestinians began their uprising
against the Israeli occupation. At least 386 Palestinians have been
killed.
   The kidnap claim came in an anonymous call to the French news
agency Agence France-Presse.
   A man who spoke Arabic said the Palestinian Arab Army had
kidnapped Sgt. Avi Sassportas, 21, and would detail its demands and
release a videotape of the paratrooper later. The caller said his
group was not affiliated with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Sassportas disappeared Feb. 16, after leaving his base in
southern Israel to return to his home city of Ashdod.
   Army officials disclosed that a similar claim was made five days
ago by the radical Marxist PLO faction Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.
   In clashes in the occupied lands Monday, nine people were wounded
in the crowded Gaza Strip refugee camps of Shati and Jabaliya. One
man was reported shot when troops opened fire to disperse a protest
in the West Bank town of Halhoul.
   In nearby Bethlehem, Palestinian youths went house to house
warning residents to heed a strike ordered by the United Leadership
of the Uprising and boycott Israel's municipal elections Tuesday,
Arab reporters said.
   A warning written on a Bethlehem wall said: ``The strike forces
will be watching for all those who will not observe the strike.''
   The army announced the occupied lands will be closed off during
the elections and that Palestinians will not be permitted to enter
Israel, Israel radio said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has called on Israelis to vote for
his right-wing Likud bloc in the local elections as a sign that
Israel rejects any dialogue with the PLO.
   Israeli newspapers reported the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine issued a statement in Damascus, Syria,
saying it would not abide by PLO chief Yasser Arafat's pledge to end
attacks on Israeli targets on the Lebanese border.
   The Front will continue its ``just struggle against Israeli
occupation,'' the newspapers quoted the PLO faction as saying.
   Israeli officials already charge that the PLO's renunciation of
terrorism is an empty promise.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Illegal Aliens Believed Shuttled On Eastern Airliners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBRA HALE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of illegal aliens may have been shuttled
across the country on a daily Eastern Airlines flight from Los
Angeles to New York, an official said Monday after 79 people were
apprehended.
   Agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service apprehended
the suspected illegal aliens shortly after Eastern Flight 80's
arrival for a stopover at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.
   ``We believe this is one of the largest operations we've
conducted that involves illegal aliens on board commercial aircraft
here in the U.S.,'' said Thomas P. Fischer, district director of the
Atlanta INS office.
   ``This may be part of a massive alien smuggling operation,'' he
said, adding that the INS would continue to investigate.
   Investigators believe illegal aliens had been aboard the same
Eastern flight nearly every day for the past 30 days, said Tom
Thomas, an INS spokesman in Atlanta. ``It appears at this point from
our sources that it's almost a daily occurrence,'' he said.
   He estimated that thousands had been moved across the country on
Eastern airliners. He said authorities did not know how they entered
the country.
   Thomas said Eastern had cooperated fully in the investigation.
   ``We don't in any way connect Eastern and don't want to intimate
that they were even remotely involved at this point,'' Thomas said.
   In Miami, Eastern Airlines spokeswoman Virginia Sanchez said:
``All I know is that the INS had told us they'd be monitoring a
flight this week and, of course, we cooperated with them.''
   The suspected aliens taken off Monday's flight included 39 from
Mexico, 22 from Guatemala, 13 from the Dominican Republic, three
from El Salvador and one each from Honduras and Ecuador. They were
to be transferred to INS processing centers in Florida and Texas for
deportations, Thomas said.
   Thomas said some of the aliens paid smugglers up to $4,000 for a
package deal, although authorities don't know what that deal
included other than air fare from California to New York.
   ``We don't know if that was out of the country to get into the
country ... to get set up in New York,'' he said, adding that the
package could have included living arrangements, phony documents and
a job.
   One-way coach tickets on the plane Monday cost from $433 to $577,
including taxes, according to a travel agent.
   One alien was Juan De La Cruz-Rodriguez, 34, who said he wanted
to make money to send to his wife and three young sons in the
Dominican Republic. He told The Atlanta Journal that a smuggler in
Mexico helped him and about a dozen others cross the border, then
arranged to have them transported by flatbed truck to Los Angeles.
   He said he sold his truck to raise part of the money and gave the
smuggler almost $1,000. He held up a quarter and said: ``That's all
I have left.''
   ``I always had the image of America having a lot of money and a
lot of wealth, and that I could find work without any problem,'' he
said, adding that he will do whatever he can to stay here ``because
if I go back, they'll put me in prison. They'll kill me if I don't
pay what I owe.''
   Special INS agents working the case acted on tips from
confidential sources at the Atlanta airport, airline employees,
undercover operations in the Los Angeles area, and even a commuter,
Thomas said.
   ``There's a commuter who regularly flies from Los Angeles to
Atlanta who called our office. ... and said, `Hey, it seems there's
an awful lot of Hispanic people who fly this flight. You might want
to check into it,''' he said.
   Thomas speculated that Eastern's Flight 80 might have been
popular because no transfers were involved and rates might have been
cheaper.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Kemp Square Off Over Bush Budget</HEAD>

   Echoes of the 1988 presidential campaign
reverberated at a meeting of the nation's governors Monday when
former Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis challenged the Bush
administration's commitment to dealing with urban problems.
   Jack Kemp, President Bush's new secretary of housing and urban
development, gave the governors an enthusiastic presentation of his
plans to attack poverty and homelessness and to help reinvigorate
the nation's cities.
   When the former New York congressman finished, the Massachusetts
governor who was the 1988 Democratic presidential nominee said ``I
applaud'' Kemp's goals.
   ``On the other hand,'' he went on, ``as I look over the
president's budget there is a yawning gap between what you're saying
and what's in there.''
   Kemp, who was one of Bush's rivals for the GOP presidential
nomination, cited federal budget problems but also pledged, ``I can
assure you that I am going to do everything I can to make sure that
there is adequate funding for those programs that work.''
   The housing secretary also said, ``I'm going to be tenacious and,
indeed, audacious in looking for programs that are not working as
well, and where we can save some money.''
   ``The budget does need some reworking,'' said Dukakis, who
carried only 10 states in the November election. He cited the
administration's proposal to cut back the Community Development
Block Grant program, which he said local governments use to attract
private investment in housing and other development projects.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and William Bennett, Bush's
choice to lead the government's anti-drug efforts, also appeared
before the governors, telling them the administration is committed
to dealing with the drug problem.
   ``To achieve what President Bush has expressed as a goal of a
kinder and gentler America, we're going to have to get rougher and
tougher with some Americans,'' said Thornburgh. ``Those who are
engaged in drug trafficking and drug-related violence are going to
have to be focused on if we are going to have safer streets and
safer communities.''
   Bennett, the former secretary of education, said, ``In some
places the problem is nothing short of ferocious.''
   But, he went on, ``we have seen a remarkable shift in public
attitudes.'' That shift has shown that the public ``is very serious
about this issue'' and prepared to accept strong measures to combat
drugs, said Bennett.
   William K. Reilly, the new director of the Environmental
Protection Agency, told the governors that enforcement of
environmental laws and regulations ``is at the heart of the EPA
mission. It gives vigor, effectiveness and vitality and reality to
all else that we do. It will have our highest priority.''
   On a matter of particular concern to governors who have nuclear
weapons facilities in their states, Reilly said his agency would
direct enforcement at governmental facilities as well as at private
industry.
   He also told the governors that dealing with pollution ``is going
to require changes, in habits, in lifestyle choices, from all
households in the country eventually, I think.''
   He cited programs under way in some communities that require
people to separate waste to help in recycling.
   At a discussion on caring for children, the governors heard from
a panel of teen-agers from Arkansas.
   When Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas asked their views on how to
reduce teen-age pregancies, two of the young people recommended more
education while rejecting proposals for distributing birth control
materials.
   Then Jerrold Culp from Lee Senior High School in Marianna drew
laughter from the governors when he said, ``In my area I think we
just need something else to do.''
   On the problem of school dropouts, Courtney Robinson of Sheridan
High School in Sheridan told the governors that ``schools need to be
more personalized.''
   ``Some students feel isolated; some students feel detached,'' she
said. ``Students' lives have to be touched.''

<HEAD>Female Marine Captain Says She Wanted to Face Accusers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Marine Corps captain facing possible
dismissal for associating with lesbians said Monday she wanted a
court-martial instead of the board of inquiry that ruled against her.
   ``I wanted to see my accusers,'' Capt. Judy Meade said in a
telephone interview. ``Instead (the prosecutor) put in statements.
(The witnesses) made many statements but (prosecutors) just took
what they wanted to put in.''
   A board of five colonels recommended Sunday that Ms. Meade
receive an ``other than honorable'' discharge after concluding that
her association with lesbians constituted conduct unbecoming an
officer.
   Ms. Meade's attorney, Vaughn Taylor, criticized the proceedings
during the five-day hearing last week, saying it did not allow for
the defense to cross-examine witnesses.
   The board of inquiry differs from a court-martial in that five
Marine officers hear the government's presentation and then rule.
The board has a legal adviser available to them.
   Ms. Meade said she was not allowed to subpoena witnesses.
   Maj. Stuart Wagner, a Camp Lejeune spokesman, said there wasn't
enough evidence to have a court-martial for a criminal charge.
   ``It isn't a crime (to associate with a lesbian) and this was not
a criminal procedure,'' Wagner said. ``This was an administrative
procedure ... akin to an employer deciding if an employee had
further service. ... I think what was in question was her judgment
and the effect that that judgment had with her personal relations
and her Marine Corps relations.''
   Professor Barry Nakell of the University of North Carolina School
of Law, a civil rights specialist, said he thought Ms. Meade's
choice of friends should be constitutionally protected by the right
of freedom of association.
   ``My position would be that as long as there is nothing about the
... friendships that would compromise security and there is nothing
to show what her sexual preference is, it should be constitutionally
protected,'' he said.
   But Wagner said a question of leadership was involved.
   ``I don't think the question at any time was whether Capt. Meade
was a homosexual,'' Wagner said. ``The question was whether her
relationship and the consequences of that relationship affected her
ability to be an effective Marine officer and remain in the Marine
Corps. The Marine Corps is a way of life.''
   Ms. Meade said she hopes for an honorable discharge for her 12
years of service. The final decision will be made by the secretary
of the Navy.
   Ms. Meade, 36, a military police officer, said she is angry over
the treatment she has received, but also said she would not
criticize the corps.
   ``The Marine Corps is a good organization. I'm never going to put
the Marine Corps down. It's not the organization, it's just some
individuals in it,'' she said.
   Most of the allegations against Ms. Meade stemmed from a February
1988 visit she made to the home of Paula Berry of Beaufort, S.C.
   Government witnesses said they saw Ms. Meade in Ms. Berry's bed
with her then.
   Both Ms. Berry and Ms. Meade acknowledged during the hearing that
Ms. Berry is a lesbian, but denied that the two ever had sexual
contact. Ms. Berry said they slept in the same bed once when Ms.
Meade fell asleep watching television.
   The board also said Ms. Meade had failed to report suspected
lesbian activity, and had misled her superior officers by
withholding information that Ms. Berry was a lesbian. It also said
Ms. Meade frequented a bar which was ``known by her to have a
questionable reputation.''
   Ms. Meade said she plans to pursue a career in security or law
enforcement.

<TEXT>
   Fire officials said Monday they don't
suspect arson in a blaze that destroyed a house on a ranch embroiled
in a labor dispute with migrant workers.
   The fire caused at least $110,000 damage to a single-story home
at Webb Ranch early Sunday when its residents, Gary Webb and his
family, were away. No one was injured. The ranch is operated by
Gary's father, Stanley Webb, on land owned by Stanford University.
   California Department of Forestry fire investigator Mike Martin
said nothing indicates arson, ``but I'm not ruling it out because of
all the attention the media has given the ranch lately.''
   Workers at the ranch have sued the Webbs and the university,
charging that they have been intimidated and threatened with loss of
jobs. A hearing is set for March 20.
   They claim harassment began after United Stanford Workers told
reporters Webb workers are subjected to unfair employment practices
and inadequate housing. The Webbs have denied the charges.

<HEAD>Woman Arraigned After Arrest At David Letterman's Home ... Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who was arrested after she was
found wandering around the home of television talk show host David
Letterman was released Monday.
   Margaret Ray, 36, was released on her own recognizance at an
arraignment hearing in Superior Court.
   But Judge Edward Levitt also suggested that Ray re-enroll in the
psychiatric program at Fairfield Hills Hospital. She had been
released from the state hospital last fall.
   Ray, who was caught driving Letterman's car and breaking into his
house last year, was arrested again Friday night when she was found
wandering around the foyer of his home in southwestern Connecticut,
police said.
   She was charged with one felony count of first-degree trespass
and one misdemeanor count each of possession of marijuana and
possession of drug paraphernalia, police said.
   Ray was scheduled for another court appearance Friday to enter a
plea, according to her attorney, Anita Cason.
   On May 22, 1988, Ray was arrested on the New Jersey side of the
Lincoln Tunnel as she was driving into New York in Letterman's 1988
Porsche with her 3-year-old son. The toll collector thought it was
suspicious that a woman driving an $80,000 automobile did not have
the $3 toll.
   Police said Ray identified herself as Letterman's wife and
introduced her son as David Letterman Jr.
   After the incident, New Canaan police discovered that someone had
broken a living room window to enter Letterman's three-bedroom home.
Police said Ray apparently had moved into the house with her son and
lived there for a couple of days while Letterman was out of town.
   Although Letterman refused to press charges against Ray for the
first incident, Ray was arrested by New Canaan police three days
later after she took a taxi to Letterman's house.
   In September, Levitt ordered Ray to give up contact with
Letterman except through the mail and to remain at Fairfield Hills,
where she had been undergoing psychiatric treatment since August
1988.

<HEAD>Marcos-Linked Condo Sold For $3.7 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philippine government on Monday sold for $3.7
million a Manhattan condominium said to have been purchased by
then-President Ferdinand Marcos with money looted from his nation's
treasury.
   It was the second piece of Marcos-linked real estate in the
United States sold by the Philippine Commission on Good Government.
The first, a house in Princeton, N.J., was sold in 1987 for $1
million.
   Teresa Roxas, a commission official, said the seven-bedroom
apartment on the 43rd floor of the Olympic Towers, a glass tower
next to St. Patricks Cathedral on Fifth Avenue, was purchased for
$3.675 million as a home for a buyer who asked not to be identified.
   The apartment was surrendered to the Philippine government in
1986 by a Marcos associate, Antonio Floirendo, as part of a deal to
avoid prosecution. It was among several properties allegedly owned
by Marcos through fronts.
   Roxas said two other such residences are on the market _
Lindenmere, an estate on Long Island, with an asking price of $4.5
million, and a home in Honolulu, for $2.5 million.
   The commission is fighting in court to gain title to four
commercial buildings in Manhattan that are worth an estimated $400
million.
   The New York holdings allegedly were purchased with some of the
$10 billion that the Philippine government alleges Marcos and his
associates embezzled before he was ousted and fled to Hawaii in 1986.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, has pleaded innocent in New York to federal
racketeering charges and is free on $5 million bail. Lawyers have
argued that Marcos, 71, is too ill to appear in court, and he is
currently hospitalized in Honolulu.
   In Manila, Nievelena Rosete, a commission member, said profits
from the condominium sale will help finance the government's land
reform program.

<HEAD>Guidelines Issued by FDA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Monday
issued standards for expectorants in nonprescription cough-cold
medicines that allow only one proven active ingredient to remain on
the market.
   Guaifenesin was the only ingredient found by the FDA to be safe
and effective in increasing sputum or phlegm volume and making it
easier to cough up.
   It is the most wiely used active ingredient used in expectorants
and is contained in the major brands of cough-cold medicines, the
FDA said.
   About 20 other expectorant ingredients were found not to be
useful and products using these ingredients will have to be
reformulated or taken off the market within one year. The FDA said
eight products listed in the Handbook of Nonprescription Drugs would
fall into this category.
   Among the 20 ingredients are ammonium chloride, a plant extract
called horehound, pine tar, spirits of turpentine and squill, the
dried inner scales of a flowering plant.
   The FDA standards were developed as part of a review of all
nonprescription drugs that began in 1972.
   The standards will let expectorant products using guaifenesin
claim on their labels that they ``help loosen phlegm (sputum) and
thin bronchial secretions to rid the bronchial passageways of
bothersome mucus, drain bronchial tubes and make coughs more
productive.''
   However, the FDA said these products will not be able to claim
that they ``relieve irritated membranes in the respiratory
passageways by preventing dryness through increased mucus flow.''
This claim was not supported by studies, the agency said.
   Labels for expectorant products must contain two warnings, the
FDA said.
   _Do not take this product for persistent or chronic cough such as
occurs with smoking, asthma, chronic bronchitis or emphysema, or
where cough is accompanied by excessive phlegm unless directed by a
doctor.
   _A persistent cough may be a sign of a serious condition. If
cough persists for more than one week, tends to recur, or is
accompanied by fever, rash or persistent headache, consult a
doctor.''

   Clara Hale, an 83-year-old New York City
woman who cares for drug-addicted babies, has been named the 1989
winner of the Truman Award for Public Service.
   Her choice was announced Monday by a selection commission
including Barbara Potts, mayor of Independence, the Kansas City
suburb that was the home to the late President Harry Truman.
   Mrs. Hale is founder of Hale House, a refuge for infants and
toddlers born chemically dependent. She and her daughter, Lorraine
Hale, will attend an award ceremony May 6 at the Truman Library and
Museum.
   Clara Hale raised more than 40 children as a foster parent in
Harlem from 1941 to 1968. The following year her daughter met a
woman and her addicted baby and referred them to her mother for
care. Since then ``Mother Hale'' has provided a home for more than
600 babies born to addicted mothers.
   In most cases, the children are reunited with their mothers after
the mothers have undergone drug rehabilitation.

<TEXT>
   Dr. Louis Sullivan, apparently heading for
confirmation as health and human services secretary, repeated his
opposition to abortion and fielded a broad range of questions on
other topics from a Senate committee Monday.
   The abortion issue, which has dogged the Atlanta doctor since his
nomination was announced, got only brief mention at the hearing
before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, as it did
before the Senate Finance Committee last week.
   In his opening statement, Sullivan said that ``abortion is wrong
and that it is inconsistent with the best of family values.''
   He said that, like President Bush, he opposes abortion except in
cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of a mother, and is
against federal funding of abortions except to save a mother's life.
   Later, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asked Sullivan to restate his
views on abortion, which the doctor did, adding that he has never
performed the procedure.
   In response to subsequent questions from Hatch, Sullivan also
said he would welcome a Supreme Court decision overturning its 1973
ruling that legalized abortion. He said he supported the Health and
Human Services Department's position that family planning funds
should not be used for abortions.
   Sullivan, however, again sidestepped the question of whether the
federal government should pay for research that uses tissue from
aborted fetuses. He said he would not state a position on the issue
until he had read the recommendations of an advisory committee.
   Hatch, a fervent opponent of abortion, said he was satisfied with
Sullivan's views and fully supported his nomination.
   The Finance Committee last week recommended full Senate approval
of Sullivan's nomination on a 19-0 vote, and Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., chairman of the labor committee, predicted a unanimous
Senate vote for Sullivan on Tuesday.
   Both committees have jurisdiction over department programs, but
the Finance Committee is the panel that recommends action on the
nomination to the full Senate. Kennedy's committee will not vote
separately on the nomination.
   His committee covered much of the same ground that the Finance
Committee did, devoting little time to abortion, the issue that has
caused Sullivan the most problems. Last week, he apologized to Sen.
Bob Packwood, R-Ore., saying he ``misspoke'' in private remarks on
the subject. He was quoted earlier in an interview with The Atlanta
Journal Constitution as supporting a woman's right to abortion.
   On Monday, senators focused more attention on President Bush's
fiscal 1990 budget proposal that would trim anticipated Medicare
spending by $5 billion and the effects of soaring medical costs on
the federal budget.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Clarifies Statement On Minimum Wage, Admits It Was `Terrible'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BLOOD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   State Rep. Paul Clymer admitted Monday he
reached ``the wrong conclusions'' when he suggested Pennsylvania's
minimum wage was adequate because minorities, slow learners and
students take home the paychecks.
   But some black legislators labeled Clymer's remarks ``racist''
and rooted in ``a slave mentality.''
   ``It's sad, really sad,'' said Sen. Hardy Williams, a black
Democrat from Philadelphia. ``His reasoning has no place in our
society. What he's saying is that he wants to underpay a whole class
of society.''
   Clymer, a five-term Republican from a largely rural,
predominantly white district in Bucks County, made the statements
about lower-wage earners in a survey of state lawmakers by The
Associated Press. Answering a question about the state's $3.70
hourly minimum wage, which was boosted 35 cents in February, he
responded:
   ``The 35-cent increase is adequate. Remember, the people earning
minimum wage are minorities, slow learners, students and part-time
employees.''
   Clymer went on to say that the federal government should be
setting the minimum wage, and that any further increases at the
state level would send a negative signal to business.
   In an interview Monday, Clymer admitted his statements appeared
``terrible,'' but he denied that any malice was involved.
   ``I just didn't put it right,'' he said. ``I thought it through,
but the conclusions I wanted to draw were not there. They were the
wrong conclusions. It's unfortunate I did not take more time; what I
should have done is take more time.''
   Clymer said he had been trying to explain that the minimum wage
sometimes provides the only employment opportunities for workers in
areas with high unemployment or where jobs are scarce.
   The minimum wage ``would give them a chance. This doesn't mean
that they shouldn't be making more money,'' he said.
   Clymer stopped short of apologizing for the remarks, saying he
meant no harm and had simply misstated his position.
   But Williams said the remarks showed ``a slave mentality'' and
were ``very racist.''
   Rep. David Richardson, a Philadelphia Democrat who chairs the
National Black Caucus of State Legislators, said Clymer should
retract the statement and apologize.
   ``It is very clear to me that this recent outburst of racial
intimidation and racial slurs ... is a shame, abominable and a
disgrace,'' he said.
   Althea Simmons, director of the Washington office of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said the remarks
carried ``racial overtones.''
   And David Wilderman, a spokesman for the state AFL-CIO, said
``there's a cross section of Pennsylvania men and women who are
working at the minimum wage,'' not only the groups listed by Clymer.

   The Pratt &amp; Whitney Division of United
Technologies Corp. on Monday won the largest share of the Air
Force's fiscal 1990 jet engine business, beating out the General
Electric Co. for the third straight year.
   The Air Force, in a brief announcement, said Pratt &amp; Whitney
would be asked to build 64 percent of the basic jet engines now used
in its fighters during the year starting next Oct. 1, while GE would
produce the remaining 36 percent.
   The service said it planned to acquire 109 of those engines
during fiscal 1990. The 64-36 split would give Pratt &amp; Whitney 70 of
those engines and GE 39.
   And in another major coup for Pratt &amp; Whitney, the Air Force said
it would split its first buy of new ``increased performance''
engines for the 1990s by a 56-to-44 percent margin in favor of Pratt.
   Current plans call for the purchase of 122 of the more powerful
engines in fiscal 1990. Sixty-eight of them will be purchased from
Pratt &amp; Whitney and the remaining 54 will come from GE, the Air
Force said.
   All told, Pratt &amp; Whitney will build 138 basic and increased
performance engines in fiscal 1990, while GE will build 93 of its
basic and increased performance engines.
   The Air Force said it would award the final contracts for the
basic engines being purchased in fiscal 1990 soon. Until that
happens, however, the service declined to estimate their values.
   The contracts for the increased performance engines, though, were
awarded Monday. They total $146.4 million to Pratt &amp; Whitney and
$126.8 million to General Electric.
   The Air Force launched what has been called the ``great engine
war'' in 1983 when it decided to stage annual competitions for the
right to supply engines for its two front-line fighters, the F-15
Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon.
   Until that point, Pratt &amp; Whitney held a monopoly on providing
the high-performance engines.
   During the first round of the competition, GE shattered Pratt &amp;
Whitney's monopoly by winning the right to produce 75 percent of the
engines in fiscal 1985. Pratt &amp; Whitney rebounded in fiscal 1986 by
winning 46 percent of the total, but GE still won the majority of
the business.
   GE then managed to increase slightly its share of the Air Force's
business for fiscal 1987 by winning 56 percent of the award to Pratt
&amp; Whitney's 44 percent. But Pratt &amp; Whitney finally reclaimed the
top spot in fiscal 1988, winning 55 percent of the business compared
to GE's 45 percent, and then held on to win the same percentage
split in 1989.
   The Air Force has described the competition as producing lower
bid prices and much-improved warranties from the two manufacturers.
   With the fiscal 1990 split included, GE has now won contracts to
produce 833 of its basic F110 engines, while Pratt &amp; Whitney has won
contracts to manufacture 768 of its F-100-220 engines.
   If the split is included for the new increased performance
engines, GE has won awards for a total 887 engines and Pratt &amp;
Whitney 836.
   The F-15 and F-16 are the Air Force's top-line fighters and are
made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp.,
respectively.

<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie is a ``heretic and a
renegade'' who blasphemed Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses,''
Moslem theologians said Monday, but they did not endorse Iran's
decree that he be killed.
   After a conference in Mecca sponsored by the World Moslem League,
the theologians said the British author, born in India to Moslem
parents, and his publishers should be tried by ``relevant courts.''
Iran was not represented at the meeting.
   Abdullah Naseef, secretary-general of the league, issued a
conference statement urging the 46-member Organization of Islamic
Conference to pursue that goal and to boycott publishing houses that
promote the book.
   The statement, distributed by the official Saudi news agency,
said Rushdie's public apology was insufficient. It said he must
confess that what he wrote about Islam, the prophet Mohammed and his
wives, and the prophet Abraham was ``pure lies and fabrication.''
   Diplomatic sources said privately it would be left to the
Organization of Islamic Conference to seek a trial either in the
British courts or in absentia in an Islamic country.
   Al-Sharq al-Awsat, a Saudi daily, said Wednesday that the meeting
in Mecca, the holy city of Islam, would demand Rushdie be tried in
an Islamic state and would ask the conference to start legal
proceedings in Britain.
   Islamic law condemns heretics to death, but only after they are
tried and refuse to repent.
   The conference at the World Moslem League headquarters in Mecca
ended Sunday with a brief statement naming several theological
issues debated. It said ``The Satanic Verses'' was discussed and
relevant recommendations would be made to Islamic states.
   Saudi Arabia's supreme theologian, Sheik Abdel-Aziz bin Baz, was
chairman of the conference.
   Iran is a member of the Organization of Islamic Conference, whose
annual meeting of foreign ministers is scheduled for March 13-16 in
Riyadh.
   The conference has demanded that member nations prevent
circulation of the book, ban newspapers and magazines from carrying
excerpts, and blacklist the publishers.

<HEAD>Doctor Becomes Key To Tower's Offensive For Defense Post</HEAD>

   The doctor whose opinion on the health of John
Tower's liver has become a key to the defense secretary-designate's
last-ditch effort to rescue his nomination said he didn't know how
the information would be used.
   Dr. Warren Lichliter, who is not Tower's primary physician, said
he was unaware until notified by reporters Sunday that the opinion
had become a weapon in Tower's new offensive for the post.
   Tower, on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley'' and CNN's
``Newsmaker Sunday,'' launched a campaign Sunday to overcome last
week's 11-9 rejection by the Senate Armed Services Committee when
his appointment comes before the full Senate.
   On both shows, Tower read portions of a letter from Lichliter,
who is on the staff of Baylor University Medical Center here, saying
that an examination after Tower's recent colon surgery showed ``no
evidence at all of alcoholic impairment or alcoholism.''
   Tower then issued a pledge to swear off alcohol if he is approved
as defense secretary.
   Lichliter said he didn't see the shows. ``I'm just finding out
about all this,'' he told the Dallas Times Herald.
   Lichliter said he prepared the statement only because Dr. R.D.
Dignan, who removed a benign lump from Tower's colon in January, was
out of town when Tower's staff called, asking for the letter to be
sent by facsimile machine. Lichliter said he routinely takes calls
in Dignan's absence.
   Dignan, Tower's primary physician, released a statement earlier
this month saying tests ``indicated no abnormalities within organ
systems that might be involved with alcohol abuse.''
   Lichliter said he spoke Sunday with Dignan about his letter, and
said Dignan backed it ``100 percent.''
   Phone calls to both doctors' offices Monday were referred to
Baylor University Medical Center spokesman Steve Habgood, who said
neither Lichliter nor Dignan would have any further comment.
   ``Both have indicated that their previous statements stand as
is,'' Habgood said.

   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of
the Soviet Union ended a visit to Iran on Monday that he said forged
closer relations despite ``ideological differences.''
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that
Shevardnadze also said in meetings with President Ali Khamenei and
Hashemi Rafsanjani, the Parliament speaker, that U.S. naval forces
should withdraw from the Persian Gulf.
   Shevardnadze was the highest Soviet official to visit Iran since
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's fundamentalist Islamic revolution
overthrew the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in February 1979.
   ``We believe relations between Iran and the Soviet Union have
been substantially transformed,'' he said before leaving for Moscow.
   IRNA said Shevardnadze renewed an invitation to Rafsanjani to
visit Moscow and the speaker accepted.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said the two governments
can ``constructively cooperate'' on many international problems.
   With Iran confronting the West over Khomeini's order that Salman
Rushdie be killed for his novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' which many
Moslems say blasphemes Islam, Soviet-Iranian relations are at their
best since the revolution.
   Khomeini and Shevardnadze met Sunday, but Iranian reports
indicated they did not discuss the Rushdie controversy despite
Britain's request to the Soviet foreign minister that he bring it up.
   After meeting Khamanei on Monday, Shevardnadze conferred with
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and signed political and
cultural agreements, IRNA reported. The agreements underscored ``new
horizons in political ties between Tehran and Moscow,'' Shevardnadze
was quoted as saying.
   His success in bolstering Soviet-Iranian relations climaxed a
10-day, five-nation Middle East tour aimed at widening the Soviet
role in a region that has long been considered a U.S. preserve.
   IRNA did not quote Shevardnadze as saying what differences remain
between Iran and the Soviet Union, but the communist bloc's state
atheism is anathema to Iran's fundamentalist Moslem leaders. The
Soviets were the main arms suppliers to Iraq during the war with
Iran.
   Many Iranian leaders, while prepared to bolster ties with the
Soviets, remain wary of their giant northern neighbor who briefly
occupied part of their country after World War II. The Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan, Iran's eastern Islamic neighbor, has
eliminated a major source of friction.
   ``We have come to the conclusion that it is a must to acknowledge
others' beliefs and respect them,'' Shevardnadze said. ``In our
opinion, Iran enjoys high international prestige.''
   He said the Soviets would push for progress in the Iran-Iraq
peace talks, which have been stalled since the Aug. 20 cease-fire.
   Khamenei called on the Soviets to pressure Iraq to stop its
alleged stalling in the negotiations so that a peace treaty can be
signed.
   Shevardnadze reiterated his call in Baghdad for the withdrawal of
foreign forces from the gulf. He had said in Baghdad that Moscow was
willing to withdraw its ships.
   ``We have explicitly announced to the American president that we
condemn the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf, and will
continue this policy until the Americans withdraw their troops from
the region,'' he said.
   The United States has 23 warships in and around the gulf. The
Soviets have seven to nine. Most European warships have left.
   The major powers either sent warships into the gulf or increased
their naval squadrons to protect merchant ships from Iranian attacks
launched in retaliation for Iraqi air raids.
   IRNA said that Khamenei told Shevardnadze that ``Iraq must be
pressured'' to break the deadlock in the peace talks, ``and we think
your government can exert this pressure more than anyone else.'' The
Soviet Union has a friendship treaty with Baghdad and is believed to
be one of its largest creditors.
   Tehran radio broadcast excerpts of the meeting between
Shevardnadze and Khomeini. IRNA said Shevardnadze was the first
foreign official to talk to Khomeini at his home.
   Khomeini seldom meets foreign dignitaries, and it was the first
he had been heard speaking publicly in months.
   IRNA said Khomeini agreed to meet Shevardnadze because he wanted
to hear a response to a message he sent to Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev in January.
   Shevardnadze said Khomeini's message, praising Gorbachev's
reforms and urging him to accept Islam, had received a ``good
response'' from Soviet leaders who read it, although they did not
agree with all of it.
   Khomeini stressed the importance of ``the expansion of strong
ties in various dimensions in confronting the devilish acts of the
West,'' Tehran radio said.
   Iran's Majlis, or parliament, votes Tuesday on a bill to sever
relations with Britain for publishing ``The Satanic Verses'' and
leading European nations in recalling their senior diplomats from
Tehran to protest the Khomeini's ``kill Rushdie'' religious decree.
   Tehran newspapers Monday supported severing ties. IRNA quoted
Qorban-Ali Saleh-Abadi, a member of parliament, as predicting
relations will be broken off. ``God willing, we will approve this
bill tomorrow,'' he said.
   Britain recalled its diplomats from Tehran and asked Iran's to
leave London after Khomeini issued his execution order Feb. 14.
   Fourteen other Western nations have withdrawn their top diplomats
from Iran in the furor over Khomeini's death sentence.

<HEAD>FCC Eases Requirements for Phone-Installation Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Monday said low-income
applicants for subsidized telephone service no longer will have to
show they've had no phone for the previous three months or that
they've received no federal phone aid for two years.
   The Federal Communications Commission said those requirements for
``Link Up America'' aid were denying service to 15 percent of all
applicants.
   The year-old federal assistance plan is designed to encourage
low-income households to obtain telephone service by helping pay for
installation.
   Qualifying households may receive up to $30 to help defray such
costs.
   Gerald Brock, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau, said
there were 385,000 people in 37 states, the District of Columbia and
Puerto Rico in the program.
   Brock said the commission decided to loosen the requirements when
it was shown it would not cost the government very much.
   ``We are finding that it has been an effective program but it has
not been so well used that the financial requirements were
overwhelming,'' Brock told reporters. ``That's one of the reasons
why we put more restrictions on at the beginning.''
   In another action Monday, the FCC ruled that radio equipment used
to provide phone service to remote areas will be considered as
belonging to the telephone companies, and consumers will not have to
buy it.
   The commission made its ruling on a petition filed by the
Colorado consulting firm of Tallon, Cheeseman &amp; Associates regarding
the Basic Exchange Telecommunications Radio Service.
   The commission said the antenna and radio equipment located on or
near the premises of users of the service should be treated as
regulated network equipment and is eligible for federal and state
programs designed to assist telephone companies that provide service
in high-cost areas.
   The company estimated the cost of this equipment to range from
$2,200 to $2,400, the commission said.
   The ruling means the FCC will increase the federal assistance
available to rural phone companies and their customers to install
such equipment, and the users will pay the same basic service
charges as regular phone users in the area.

<HEAD>Arafat Tells Scholars Uprising on West Bank Will Not Be Curbed</HEAD>

   The Palestine Liberation Organization will not
call a halt to the uprising on the West Bank and in Gaza before
Israel agrees to negotiate, a group of scholars who met recently
with Yasser Arafat said Monday.
   The 15-month uprising could be ``notched up a bit or notched
down'' as part of the PLO's strategy for drawing Israel into
negotiations, former White House official William B. Quandt said.
   However, recounting recent talks in Tunis with Arafat and other
PLO officials, Quandt said they did not offer to call off the
``intefadeh,'' in which 386 Palestinian Arabs and 17 Israelis have
died, if Israel yielded.
   Quandt, who was an analyst on the Middle East and the Persian
Gulf at the National Security Council, was accompanied to Tunis for
the PLO meetings by former Assistant Secretary of State Harold H.
Saunders and Helena Cobban, a scholar. They are now at the Brookings
Institution, a private research group.
   Israel has refused to negotiate with the PLO, accusing it of
terrorism and citing a provision in the PLO covenant calling for the
destruction of the Jewish state. The United States last December
opened talks with the PLO.
   However, Quandt said the talks had fallen short of PLO
expectations and U.S. promises. He said he found Arafat and other
PLO officials ``a bit frustrated and disappointed with the virtual
non-existence of the U.S.-PLO dialogue.''
   The former Carter administration official added: ``They had been
promised at the time the dialogue began there would be substantive
talks. There have been virtually none.''
   Asked about Quandt's account, Charles E. Redman, the State
Department spokesman, said he ``couldn't speak to someone else's
expectations.''
   The U.S. official said the government decision to talk to the PLO
``was made at the end of the previous administration, and we're now
in the early stages of a new administration. But beyond that, I
don't really have any way to interpret somebody else's
expectations.''
   On a related subject, Saunders said the PLO envisioned a
two-state solution to its dispute with Israel, with no Berlin Wall
or barbed wires in between.
   ``Amyone who commits a terrorist act against Israel would be
punished,'' Saunders said.
   The PLO leaders told the American delegation they had hoped in
the past to create a single secular state, Saunders said. But they
said in Tunis ``we are transformed'' and are prepared to live in
permanent peace alongside Israel, he said.
   Saunders said Arafat envisioned open borders and full diplomatic
relations with Israel, plus economic relations with Jordan as well.

   The SR-71 Blackbird, a futuristic-looking spy
plane whose speed records have never been broken and which can
photograph a license plate from 17 miles up, will retire after
nearly 25 years of service, the Air Force said Monday.
   The black, twin-engine jet was the original stealth aircraft and
was never armed because it can easily outrace enemy missiles and
fighters, Air Force officials said.
   Exact figures are classified, but the Air Force reportedly will
save up to $300 million a year by retiring the SR-71 squadron on
Oct. 1.
   Defense budget priorities are forcing the SR-71 fleet into
mothballs and satellites will take over its duties, a Pentagon
spokesman said.
   ``We will rely on existing reconnaissance capabilities, which I
can't be real specific about, but you can assume that it is mainly
satellite capability,'' Air Force Lt. Col. Joe Purka said in a
telephone interview.
   Although still largely shrouded in secrecy, some details of the
elusive photo reconnaissance plane have been made public and it was
even featured in a 1984-85 television series, ``Call to Glory,''
about an Air Force family.
   Despite its age _ the first one was delivered in 1966 _ it still
holds world records for jet-powered speed and altitude, set in 1976
with a speed of 2,193 mph and an altitude of 85,000 feet.
   In September 1974, a Blackbird flew from London to Los Angeles in
3 hours, 47 minutes, or, taking into account the time zones it
crossed, four hours before it left.
   Air Force pilot Lt. Col. Bill Orcutt says the jet carries
considerable mystique despite its vintage.
   ``It looks like something from outer space,'' Orcutt said
recently. ``The SR-71 excites the boy in all of us who love to fly.''
   At peak altitude, pilots can view the curvature of the Earth, and
when they look straight up they see the blackness of space.
   The Blackbird's speed of more than 2,000 mph is three times the
speed of sound, or 33 miles a minute, faster than a rifle bullet. It
can survey 100 square miles an hour, he said.
   The Air Force tried to retire the Blackbird squadron last year,
but was overruled by Congress.
   House Armed Services subcommittee staffer Jim Waters said no such
move has been made in Washington so far, but couldn't predict
whether Congress would fight the planned retirement.
   ``It's a very costly system to operate, but there are people,
both in the military and in Congress, that want to keep it around,''
Waters said.
   Nine or 10 Blackbirds reportedly remain from the original lot of
about 30.
   The SR-71 squadron is headquartered at Beale Air Force Base near
Marysville in northern California. Its support facilities are at Air
Force Plant 42, about 50 miles north of Los Angeles in Palmdale.
   Plant 42 is the site of the Air Force's stealth research and
development, which began with Blackbird's sleek design and
radar-evading capabilities, officials said.
   The supersecret plane built by Lockheed Corp. as a successor to
the U-2 was officially acknowledged by then-President Lyndon Johnson
on July 24, 1964.
   Development began in February 1963, and the first model was
delivered in January 1966, Purka said.
   Operated under the Strategic Air Command, the SR-71s also operate
out of bases in England and Japan, said SAC spokeswoman Maj. Suzanne
Randall.

   Troops and tanks moved into Kosovo
province Monday, while ethnic Albanian miners ended their eight-day
sit-in deep in a mineshaft after three provincial Communist party
leaders resigned as the strikers demanded.
   However, the miners said they would not work until their other
demands were met, including the abandonment of planned
constitutional changes that would give Serbia more control over the
province.
   At another mine, workers from the province's Slavic minority
began a strike in support of the party officials.
   The official Tanjug news agency said the government put emergency
measures into effect immediately in Kosovo, an autonomous province
of the Serbian republic, but did not describe them.
   Air force jets flew over the provincial capital Pristina several
times in a show of might by the federal government, which is trying
to end a wave of protests by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo that began
with the miners' strike.
   Tanks were parked in front of the army barracks. Military
vehicles loaded with soldiers headed toward Titova Mitrovica, where
the miners were occupying the Trepca lead and zinc mine.
   The miners began leaving the mine after the resignations of the
three officials, who are ethnic Albanians but are seen as supporters
of the Serbian Communist party.
   The state Tanjug news agency said that ``the first of the 1,300
ethnic Albanian miners were taken out of the mine shaft on
stretchers'' at about 21:30 local time (3 p.m. EST) and that the
others followed.
   Belgrade television showed a film clip with weakened miners
coming out of the pit leaning on each other and supported by medical
staff who shielded their eyes from the TV light.
   Kosovo is adjacent to Albania and its population of 1.8 million
is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. Minority Slavs often complain of
discrimination in the province and martial law was imposed briefly
in 1981 after bloody riots between ethnic Albanians and security
forces.
   Rahman Morina, the provincial party chief, resigned Monday and
Belgrade radio quoted him as saying, in a comment directed at the
Trepca miners: ``I am deeply shaken that you consider me responsible
for your lives and health. It is only for this reason that I am
submitting the resignation.''
   Husamedin Azemi, party chief of Pristina, cited ``moral
considerations and ... blackmail'' for resigning. Serb and
Montenegrin members of the Pristina party leadership threatened to
quit if Azemi left his post.
   Ali Sukrija, Kosovo's member in the country's policy-setting
Central Committee, also stepped down.
   At another lead and zinc mine, 800 members of Kosovo's Slavic
minority occupied their pits and said they would continue the strike
if the three leaders resigned.
   Tanjug said thousands of Slavs staged protest meetings in
different regions of Kosovo Monday to protest the resignations.
   Some 100,000 Slovenians and ethnic Albanians in Slovenia, the
most developed and liberal Yugoslav republic, signed a petition
protesting the introduction of emergency measures in Kosovo, Tanjug
said.
   About 300 ethnic Albanians marched in the Slovenian capital of
Ljubljana in support of the Trepca miners, Belgrade radio reported.
   On Saturday, the nine-member federal presidency ordered tighter
internal security in Kosovo. More soldiers and police than usual
were on Pristina's streets Monday, many guarding official buildings
and army installations.
   The national Communist Party leadership appealed to the Trepca
miners to end the strike and cooperate in ``urgent, open, democratic
consideration'' of their demands.
   Many stores, schools and universities in the province closed in
sympathy strikes, but several ethnic Albanian merchants were seen
opening their stores Monday afternoon.
   In Slovenia, the legislature called for an immediate session of
the national parliament to consider the Kosovo situation.
   Slovenia and Croatia oppose attempts by Slobodan Milosevic, the
ambitious leader of Serbia's League of Communists, or Communist
party, to gain more control over Kosovo and Vojvodina, another
autonomous province in the republic.

<TEXT>
   The governor and a former Ku Klux Klan
grand wizard recently elected to the state legislature locked horns
Monday over setting aside some state highway contracts for
black-owned companies.
   ``We have a very clear process of racial discrimination going on
in this bill,'' Rep. David Duke said during an appearance before the
House Appropriations Committee.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer, also making an appearance before the
committee, said he did not believe the minority set-asides would be
a permanent fixture in awarding highway contracts. ``They are only a
transition,'' the Democrat said.
   Duke, a Republican from suburban New Orleans, was elected to the
state legislature Feb. 18 after a heated campaign in which he drew
opposition from President Bush, former President Reagan, and most of
the area's political elite.
   He is not a member of the appropriations panel. Like the
governor, he appeared to testify about the set-aside programs.
   For Duke, it was one of the first opportunities to address a
campaign pledge to oppose special treatment for blacks.
   The committee voted 12-3 against Duke and for the governor,
sending the bill to the House floor for debate.
   Under set-asides, a portion of government contracts are reserved
for minority-owned companies as a remedy for past discrimination.
   Roemer, who wants a $1.5 billion program for highways, airports
and ports financed by an additional 4-cent tax on gasoline, said the
bill would ``make sure the entire state moves together in economic
development.''
   The governor said his administration wanted to limit such
programs to 10 percent of the total.
   But Duke, elected after campaigning against set-aside programs,
said the bill would discriminate against white contractors.
   He claimed Roemer's transportation program could cost up to $200
million more if set-aside programs were used, he said.
   Duke, a 38-year-old Republican from suburban New Orleans, quit
the Klan in 1980 in a leadership dispute, and set up his own
organization, the National Association for the Advancement of White
People.
   Rep. Sherman Copelin, a black Democrat from New Orleans, said the
bill had been drawn with the help of the Associated General
Contractors, the state's largest contracting group.
   According to the bill, the governor would be required to have a
study committee determine whether black contractors have been
discriminated against. The Legislature would be in charge of drawing
up guidelines for the set-aside program if the study found
discrimination.
   If lawmakers did not act by June 30, Roemer could impose
guidelines by executive order.
   The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year struck down a Richmond,

projects for companies at least half-owned by minorities because the

<HEAD>NASA Heat Sensors Find Buried Spanish Mission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists have begun unearthing the
remains of a 17th-century Spanish mission that they located in a
pasture with the help of an airborne heat sensor developed by NASA.
   ``It's fantastic,'' says Jerry Milanich, curator in archaeology
at the University of Florida's Florida Museum of Natural History.
   ``I never saw anything so magical in my life,'' he said of the
computer-generated map that revealed the outlines of what little is
left of the Mission Santa Fe de Toloco.
   In the past few weeks, teams headed by Milanich have unearthed
what they are convinced are the outlines of the mission's three main
buildings: the kitchen, the priests' residence and the church. They
also have found the mission's cemetery.
   These relics have been hidden since 1702, when British soldiers
and their Indian allies burned and looted the century-old Santa Fe
de Toloco. Soon, ruins were plowed into the soil or covered by
natural soil buildup.
   On Christmas Eve 1986, a field crew headed by graduate student
Ken Johnson stumbled across pottery, spikes and clay near the Santa
Fe River in Alachua County, north of the school's campus in
Gainesville. Using Spanish documents, they were able to narrow the
location of Santa Fe de Toloco to within 10 miles.
   Milanich and researchers contracted with the Space Remote Sensing
Center, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration-supported
research center in Mississippi. Last April, a plane outfitted with a
heat-sensing scanner flew over the site.
   Computers analyzed the site's radiated heat to differentiate
surrounding soil from clay and other early construction materials,
which absorb heat differently. They then created a color image which
can show differences in heat of as little as a half degree.
   The instruments will revolutionize archaeology, Milanich said,
noting they saved at least $10,000 in this instance and as much as
five years of work.
   Once the imagery pinpointed parts of the mission's remnants, digs
could focus on specific areas and avoid damaging important sections
of the site, he said.
   During the latter half of the 16th century and all of the 17th
century, more than 40 mission outposts dotted La Florida, the name
given the entire known North American continent during the two
centuries Spain dominated the area.
   One chain of missions stretched from St. Augustine north to
coastal South Carolina, while another extended west across the
Florida Panhandle. One remnant of the trails that connected them is
a dirt alley between homes on the west side of Gainesville.
   The indigenous Indians were eventually wiped out by European
soldiers and diseases; Seminoles from the north took their place.
The missionaries abandoned their attempt to bring Christianity to
the natives.

   Authorities ordered about 2,000 people to stay
away from their homes Monday as firefighters helplessly stood
watching a butane fire that started when a train derailed and a tank
car exploded.
   Police asked residents of 1,500 homes within a half mile of the
derailment to evacuate after 21 CSX cars jumped a Conrail track
south of downtown near the B.F. Goodrich Chemical Plant Sunday
evening. The fire spread briefly to the Goodrich loading dock,
prompting the evacuation of workers.
   No one was seriously injured, officials said.
   The University of Akron as well as Akron public and parochial
schools were closed Monday, and metropolitan bus service was
canceled because the city bus garage is near the derailment.
Businesses in the area of the explosion shut down.
   A CSX crew used a crane to begin pulling derailed cars upright,
but Fire Chief George Romanoski said firefighters could do nothing
about the exploded tank car except to let it burn out on its own.
Fires that started at a valve on an adjacent car and beneath a third
car were out, he said.
   Mary Noble, 83, who was awakened by her landlord and a police
officer as she slept Sunday in her Akron apartment, waited patiently
but nervously in a school cafeteria Monday as two small fires
continued to burn.
   ``I'm calm now, but inside I'm worried,'' she said.
   Cathy Miglin, a Kenmore High School employee who was helping the
evacuees, heard the blast from her home two miles west of the
derailment.
   ``I heard the explosion and all the sirens, and the dog next door
was howling, so we knew something was up,'' she said. ``And then we
saw that the sky was all lit up.
   ``The flames shot at least 500 feet in the air, just like a big
mushroom going up. And the sirens just started coming from
everywhere.''
   Thirteen people were treated at Akron General Hospital, most
suffering from inhalation of smoke and fumes.
   R.L. Leckie, spokesman for CSX Transportation in Jacksonville,
Fla., said nine of the derailed cars were carrying butane. One of
the tankers was ruptured by the derailment and immediately caught
fire, he said.
   Claire Austin, a spokeswoman for the Federal Railroad
Administration in Washington, said Conrail last inspected the track
on Feb. 23. The FRA last checked in late February 1988.
   No problems were found last week and ``only minor variances''
were found in the 1988 inspection, Ms. Austin said.
   Conrail is required to inspect the track twice a week.
   Ms. Austin said the five FRA inspectors and FRA's regional
director at the scene have spoken with the engineer. Alcohol and
drug tests have been conducted, but the results were not immediately
known.
   ``There didn't seem to be any problem with that from what they
saw,'' she said. ``The cause of the derailment remains unknown.''
   Evacuees were sent to the University of Akron's James A. Rhodes
Arena, and many went to stay with relatives and friends, officials
said.
   Lewis said many of the derailed cars carried non-hazardous
materials, including vegetable oil, clay and sand. One car carried
butadiene, which may produce hazardous smoke when burned, but it was
too far from the burning cars to cause concern, Mayor Don
Plusquellic said.

<HEAD>Former Police Officer Killed in Car Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb explosion killed a
former senior police officer as he drove in east Belfast on Monday
and the Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility _ its second
victim in two days.
   Police said the victim was a Catholic who retired from the force
three years ago.
   In Cookstown, in the center of the province, the army defused a
200-pound car bomb found in the center of a predominantly Protestant
housing estate. Discovery of the bomb forced about 70 families to
sleep elsewhere Monday night.
   In Londonderry, police said a 6-pound bomb packed with nails was
found near an elementary school. A police spokesman called the bomb
``fiendish and completely indiscriminate.''
   Police also were questioning two men in Londonderry following
discovery of a cache of bomb-making ingredients.
   The outlawed IRA said the former officer killed on Monday had not
severed his ties with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's
police force.
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, called
the IRA statement a ``repugnant tissue of lies.''
   The mainly Catholic IRA has targeted soldiers and police in its
fight to drive the British from Northern Ireland and unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the overwhelmingly Catholic
Republic of Ireland.
   Police on Monday identified a man shot dead Sunday night by the
IRA as Joseph Fenton, 35.
   The IRA accused Fenton, also a Catholic, of being a British
agent. Police said they were not aware of any connections between
Fenton and the security forces.

<HEAD>Congressman Says He Was Set Up in Child Sex Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens said Monday he
was set up and solicited for money in connection with an alleged
sexual incident involving a teen-age girl.
   In an interview at his district office in this western Ohio city,
Lukens denied the charge of contributing to the unruliness and
delinquency of a child, a 16-year-old girl. A grand jury in Columbus
indicted the 58-year-old Republican on the misdemeanor charge
Thursday.
   ``I was approached for money on the basis of the general
allegation,'' he said. ``I said, `Hey, I'm not going to pay any
money. Nothing happened.'''
   Lukens said he was asked for money more than once, with the
threat that those involved would go to police and the news media if
he refused. He questioned why police were not immediately notified
following the alleged incident.
   ``I believe that I was set up, and I know for a fact because I
was the person they asked for money,'' Lukens said.
   He would not specify who approached him for money, adding that
there are some things he can't discuss because they will be the
basis of his defense.
   In an interview with a Dayton television station, Lukens denied
having sex with the girl.
   ``Did you have sex with (the girl)?'' the interviewer asked.
   ``No,'' Lukens replied.
   Lukens, who is divorced, did not deny he knew the girl and said
he met her on occasion.
   Lukens made his remarks during interviews with reporters
following a meeting with local supporters and constituents in
Greenville, which is about 40 miles northwest of Dayton. Earlier
Monday, Lukens met with supporters at a private residence in
Middletown and gave interviews to newspapers in Hamilton and Eaton.
   They were his first public appearances in his district since the
investigation was revealed nearly a month ago.
   ``I'm back at work,'' Lukens said, promising to complete his
two-year congressional term, which expires in 1990.
   Lukens charged that the news media assumed he was guilty and
failed to investigate the moral character of the people involved.
   He also accused Columbus television station WSYX of delaying
broadcast of a videotaped meeting he had with the girl's mother for
five weeks to take advantage of a ratings week. WSYX News Director
Carl Twentier denied the charge.
   Lukens said he has not seen the secretly recorded videotape,
which shows him meeting with Anna Coffman last November in a
Columbus fast-food restaurant.
   In the videotape, broadcast by WSYX on Feb. 1, Ms. Coffman asks
why Lukens was ``messing around'' with her daughter. She alleged
that Lukens had a sexual relationship with her daughter on two
occasions, once when the girl was 13. The daughter is now 17.
   In the videotape, Lukens responds that he thought the daughter
was an adult.
   The grand jury indicted Lukens in connection with an act of
sexual intercourse that allegedly occurred last November, when the
girl was 16. Prosecutors said they have evidence money was involved.
   If convicted, Lukens could be sentenced to 180 days in jail and a
$1,000 fine.

<HEAD>Panel Begins Reviewing Wright Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee Monday began an
exhaustive review of a special counsel's investigative report on
alleged ethics violations of Speaker Jim Wright, and members said
they would be in no rush to finish.
   The panel's closed-door deliberations are being held in strict
secrecy and committee Chairman Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said he
expects no announcement of any results until the week of March 13.
   ``I think everyone's getting their questions answered,'' said
Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana, the panel's senior Republican, after
seven hours of deliberations. ``We are dealing with very sensitive
matters here _ people's careers.''
   The committee is scheduled to meet again Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, and panel members have been asked to keep their calendars
clear next week as well.
   Dixon said the special outside counsel hired to investigate the
Wright matter, Richard J. Phelan, is presenting his findings count
by count. Members can then ask questions and Wright's lawyer,
William C. Oldaker, can comment on the evidence, he said.
   Wright, D-Texas, is alleged, in a six-count resolution, to have
abused his office for personal financial gain. The charges include
using a congressional aide to help compile a book on which Wright
earned some $55,000 in royalties and using a condominium in his
hometown of Fort Worth without paying full market value.
   He also is alleged to have improperly lobbied federal officials
on behalf of Texas savings and loan institutions and lobbied for a
gas venture in which he had a financial stake.
   Wright has steadfastly denied violating any law or rule of the
House, although he has conceded he might have done some things
differently if he had them to do over.
   The committee has spent nearly $1 million on the probe, which
began in June, most of it for Phelan's legal fees. His report to the
committee runs about 450 pages and includes only findings of fact on
the six allegations against Wright, but no recommendations on
whether the facts warrant disciplinary action, said one committee
source, speaking only on condition of anonymity.
   The source said Phelan has used the broadest possible
interpretation of each of the six counts, and has in some cases
divided them into sub-categories. That enabled Phelan, for example,
to go into Wright's financial dealings with Fort Worth business
partner George Mallick under the heading of looking into the
condominium, which was owned by Mallick's son.
   Myers said the presence of Oldaker was unusual. But he added:
``We're just trying to be as generous as we can.'' Committee rules
provide that a member who is the subject of an investigation can be
given a chance to comment on the allegations.
   The process ``is adversarial in the sense that both sides will
represent their points of view,'' Dixon said. ``The facts are always
subject to interpretation.''
   Oldaker had no comment on the probe as he entered the hearing
room, except to say: ``The process has gone on for a long period of
time. We hope for an early resolution.''
   The committee's current deliberations are the culmination of a
process known as a preliminary inquiry, the panel's equivalent of a
grand jury investigation.
   Dixon said the committee will hear the presentations of the two
lawyers and discuss the findings, then decide whether to take the
next step in the process _ issuing a statement of alleged violation,
which is akin to an indictment.
   Wright has not been given a copy of Phelan's report and was not
scheduled to attend the deliberations, Dixon said.

<HEAD>Ag Officials Say Food Supply Safe from Aflatoxin Health Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public health is not threatened by
aflatoxin, a cancer-causing substance found in part of the nation's
corn supply, agricultural leaders said Monday.
   Directors of agriculture from key farm states said recent reports
that corn containing aflatoxin had escaped detection and gotten into
food products were misleading.
   ``Consumers need not be afraid that tainted products are in the
food chain,'' said Dale Cochran, Iowa secretary of agriculture.
``Yes, I'm quite convinced ... that the supply is being checked
quite carefully.''
   The heat and drought of 1988 provided ideal conditions for
development of the fungus that produces aflatoxin, which has been
linked to the development of liver cancer in laboratory rats.
   The Wall Street Journal reported last week that aflatoxin-tainted
corn is moving through the nation's food supply.
   The newspaper, which conducted a five-month-investigation,
reported that inadequate sampling and unreliable testing of corn
after the harvest contributed to the distribution of tainted grain.
   But Illinois agriculture director Larry Werries said tests by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration showed no aflatoxin contamination
of finished food products in his state.
   Werries said his own agency's tests of milk samples also showed
no contamination. Dairy cattle are fed corn, and he said that should
be ``the first place it shows.''
   The limit for aflatoxin is 20 parts per billion for corn that
will be used in food production or will be fed to dairy cattle, said
Werries. Under current regulations, corn with higher levels of
aflatoxin may be fed to meat-producing animals such as cattle and
hogs.
   So even if a farmer sold corn with more than 20 parts per billion
of aflatoxin, ``the elevator likely has an outlet for it,'' said
Werries.
   ``In my opinion, the system works,'' he said.
   Cochran said tests by his agency in Iowa showed 98 percent of the
milk samples were safe. Milk from three farms was tainted, so it was
not distributed and other milk sales by those farms was stopped, he
said.
   Missouri's director of agriculture, Charles Kruse, said there
probably was no greater problem with aflatoxin in his state this
year than in some previous years.
   ``There is a greater awareness ... than perhaps there was five or
10 years ago,'' said Kruse. ``There is certainly more testing going
on now.''
   The Journal said some experts do not believe the government or
the grain industry can deal adequately with the aflatoxin outbreak
of 1988.
   ``There is just no way of policing a massive system of commerce
and trade,'' plant pathologist David Wilson of the University of
Georgia told the newspaper.
   Officials at the world's largest cereal mill _ Quaker Oats Co. in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa _ say they test incoming corn for aflatoxin.
   ``It's the most serious thing we look for,'' plant manager
Kenneth Dykes told the Journal. ``I don't think farmers and
elevators do screen for aflatoxin.''
   But Steve Wentworth, an Illinois farmer and president of the
National Corn Growers Association, said there is extensive aflatoxin
testing by both the government and private industry.
   And he said it was misleading to suggest that farmers are
ignorant of the problem or are willing to try to sell corn that
exceeds federal limits for aflatoxin.
   ``Farmers are consumers and want the nation's food supply to be
as safe as possible,'' Wentworth said.

<HEAD>Bush's Remarks As He Returns From Trip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of President Bush's
remarks Monday at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland as he returned
from his trip to Asia.
   Well, let me just say that it is great to be back home again at
the conclusion of a productive and rewarding trip to Japan, China,
and Korea, a trip which underscored that America is and will remain
a Pacific power.
   There were important symbols.
   I'll never forget that solemn moment when we paid our nation's
respect to the late emperor of Japan; the warm and genuine
handshakes between old friends in Beijing's Great Hall of the
People; the opportunity for the freely elected leader of a
200-year-old nation to address the freely elected legislature of a
blossoming democracy, Korea.
   But, we laid out an important substantive course, thoughtful and
candid conversations with world leaders, over 20 of them, leaders
from Asia: China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, India,
Pakistan, and the Philippines; and our allies from Europe: France,
Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Germany, and Spain; and meeting
leaders from the Middle East: Egypt, Israel, and Jordan, and the
presidents of Brazil, Nigeria, and Zaire.
   And, so, I return tonight pleased with the progress made toward
lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with our allies and
friends.
   Of course differences remain.
   Work is yet to be done; opening foreign markets to U.S.
competition, continuing to encourage the growth of democracy and
human rights and strengthening of our alliances.
   But, common ground was found.
   In Japan, we have our most important Asian ally and one of our
largest trading partners.
   Our discussions there emphasized the responsibilities we share in
the field of defense.
   But, we also spoke of ways in which the world's strongest and
most innovative economies can cooperate more closely to fuel growth
not only at home, but also in the developing world.
   In China, I talked with the leaders that I'd known nearly 15
years ago when I served as chief of the U.S. Liaison Office.
   And, it is clear from my trip that China approaches its thaw with
the Soviets with caution and realism.
   We agreed that the Soviets must be judged not by their rhetoric,
but by their actions.
   Such as whether the Soviet Union actually draws down its military
forces along China's border and persists in encouraging Vietnam to
completely withdraw from Cambodia.
   We also agreed that after Cambodia has achieved a genuine end to
Vietnam's occupation, free elections should be held under a
coalition government, led by Prince Sihanouk, with whom I met in
Beijing.
   The United States remains committed to a result that precludes a
return to power by the Khmer Rouge and the Chinese leaders
appreciate our concern and are willing to work toward a peaceful
coalition.
   On the final leg of my journey, I went to Korea, where I saw both
democracy and economic liberty work in a country whose security is
assured by our joint efforts and vigilance.
   Thirty years ago, such progress was unimaginable and it stands as
a testament to the Korean people and our commitment to them.
   From these four days of intensive discussions, I return with one
especially vivid impression.
   The world looks to America for leadership, not just because we're
militarily strong, not just because we have the world's largest
economy, but because the ideas we have championed are now dominant _
freedom and democracy, openness and the prosperity that derives from
individual initiatives in the free marketplace.
   These ideas, once thought to be strictly American, have now
become the goals of mankind all over Asia.
   The success of our nation's foreign policy is the responsibility
of the president, with the counsel and support of the Congress.
   And this important trip has only underscored for me what can be
achieved through a strong and bipartisan working relationship
between the White House and Congress.
   I'm anxious to sit down with congressional leadership to brief
them on details of these critical visits.
   And together we must ensure that this initial success is only a
first step down a long path of peace and understanding with our
friends and allies.
   If common ground can be found halfway around the world in the
shadow of Mount Fuji, in the historic Great Hall of the People, or
the Garden of Korea's Blue House, surely it can be found at home
among men and women of common purpose.
   We must respect each other and join together as one in pursuing a
foreign policy that ensures the security of our country, its
economic opportunity and freedom and individual rights around the
world.
   It's great to be home.
   God bless the United States of America.
   Thank you all very much.

   President Bush returned home Monday night from
a five-day Asian voyage that he pronounced a ``productive and
rewarding'' journey and moved to take personal command of the
struggle to win confirmation for John Tower as defense secretary.
   In a prepared statement he read at the foot of the ramp to Air
Force One, Bush said his trip to Japan, China and South Korea
demonstrated that the United States ``is and will remain a Pacific
power.''
   ``It's great to be home. God bless the United States of
America,'' Bush said in the chilly darkness at Andrews Air Force
Base in suburban Maryland. Vice President Dan Quayle was on hand to
welcome the new president back from his first overseas voyage.
   In his brief statement, the president said he had held
``thoughtful and candid conversations'' with world leaders,
including the several he met with in Japan, where he attended the
funeral of Emperor Hirohito. From there he went to China for two
days, followed by a five-hour stopover in Seoul.
   ``I return tonight pleased with the progress made toward lasting
and mutually beneficial relationships,'' Bush said. He said work
remains to be done toward encouraging the growth of democracy,
working for human rights, strengthening international alliances and
opening foreign markets to American goods.
   Bush made no direct reference to the Tower nomination in his
airport statement.
   But in comments to reporters just before his plane touched down,
he said, ``No one has challenged his qualifications to head the
Pentagon.''
   ``I don't have any predictions nor do I plan to except to say I
haven't wavered one iota and I don't intend to,'' he said.
   In assessing his trip, Bush also addressed relations between
China and the Soviet Union, although he didn't mention Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's springtime visit to Beijing.
   ``China approaches its thaw with the Soviets with caution and
realism. We agreed that the Soviets must be judged not by their
rhetoric but by their actions, such as whether the Soviet Union
actually draws down its military forces along China's border and
persists in encouraging Vietnam to completely withdraw from
Cambodia,'' Bush said.
   Bush also said he agreed with the Chinese that free elections
should be held in Cambodia after Vietnam occupation ends ``under a
coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk...The United States
remains committed by a result that precludes a return to power by
the Khmer Rouge and the Chinese leaders appreciate our concern and
are willing to work toward a peaceful coalition,'' he said.
   Tower has been plagued by allegations of drinking and womanizing,
as well as possible conflicts of interest stemming from the hundreds
of thousands of dollars he received as a defense industry consultant
in recent years.
   Asked whether Tower's weekend vow of alcohol abstinence would
help his chances, Bush laughed and said, ``I don't know.''
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu was meeting with
Republican senators to discuss the nomination shortly after Air
Force One landed in Washington.
   Aides said the president intended to spare no effort in a bid to
prevail in the first high-stakes political struggle of his
administration. He invited Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell to
the White House for breakfast on Tuesday, the first of several
planned sessions with Democrats whose votes will be crucial to
Tower's chances.
   Tower's appointment was rejected 11-9 in a party line vote last
week by the Armed Services Committee, and the full Senate is
expected to take up the appointment beginning on Wednesday.
   Bush planned to meet at the White House with 12 Democratic
senators beginning shortly after 8 a.m. Tuesday morning in a bid to
get them to ``keep an open mind'' and build support for Tower, said
Fitzwater.
   The president's aides say they are hopeful that Tower's unusual
weekend pledge to abstain from drinking alcohol if confirmed would
help boost his chances.
   Fitzwater said that ``should take care of the drinking
situation'' that many senators said was bothering them.
   But prospects for confirmation still appeared difficult.
   Defense was also the main subject in Bush's speech earlier Monday
to the National Assembly in Seoul. The president vowed to keep U.S.
troops stationed there so long as they were requested by the
government to preserve stability.
   On another subject, Bush voiced concerns over the U.S.-South
Korea trade imbalance, both in his speech to the lawmakers and after
a meeting with President Roh Tae-Woo. He suggested that South Korea
do more to lower its barriers to U.S. goods.
   ``Korea has benefited from the U.S. open markets ... We must
expect fair access to the markets here,'' Bush said after the
meeting with Roh.
   Roh voiced support for free markets throughout the world. He said
he and Bush agreed to work on problems ``resulting from the rapid
expansion of economic relations between our two countries.''
   Returning to the West, Bush left a volatile climate in South
Korea, with anti-American protesters and police clashing in the
streets of at least six cities.
   In Seoul, about 700 radical students shouting ``Bush go home!''
threw firebombs and rocks at police around Dongguk University in an
abortive attempt to march on the U.S. Embassy about three miles away.
   Students burned effigies of Bush and Roh Tae-woo at a rally on
the school grounds, and leaders charged that Washington keeps troops
in South Korea to enforce its rule.
   Police arrested about 15 prominent dissidents shouting ``no Bush
visit'' who had tried to assemble near the downtown embassy.
   The anti-American violence prompted tight security for Bush's
brief visit, and his trip from a military airfield to town for his
meetings was made by helicopter.

<HEAD>Publisher Says Camelot May Be in Scotland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two scholars think King Arthur's men gathered in
Scotland, not southwest England, and believe they were knights of
the round room, not the round table, the publisher of Burke's
Peerage said Monday.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, who presides over the directory of Britain's
aristocracy, said Norma Goodrich of Claremont, Calif., and Robert
Mitchell of Miami are convinced by their research in the area that
the knights assembled near Stirling, Scotland.
   Brooks-Baker, in a press statement, said the scholars believe
what became known as the round table actually was a rotunda and the
mistake was made in translating the word ``roonde'' _ apparently
early French _ as an adjective rather than a noun meaning rotunda.
   The stones are believed buried near the river Carron, where they
were used to repair a dam in 1743, and one was found at the time to
have been carved, said the publisher, who offered few specifics to
support his case.
   King Arthur, Guinevere, Sir Galahad and Sir Lancelot are part of
a story that developed in the 12th century, apparently based on a
Roman-British leader who fought Saxon invaders in the 6th century.
   Arthur's legend was embroidered through the ages and immortalized
by writers Sir Thomas Malory and T.H. White and the poet Tennyson.
   Many say the heroic king was buried in Glastonbury, southwest
England. The village of Tintagel, also in the southwest, has a long
association with Arthurian legend.
   An archaelogical site at Yeovil in Somerset, southwest England,
is suggested as a possible Camelot, the capital of Arthur's kingdom,
so if Arthur really lived in Scotland it's a sharp change of
direction.
   Test drilling has been done at the Stirling site and excavation
will cost more than $260,000, Brooks-Baker said.
   In October, Ms. Goodrich said research by Brooks-Baker's
publishing house proved one of Arthur's forts was at Ayr, Scotland,
which Burke's said was known as Camelot. Ayr is 55 miles southwest
of Stirling.
   Ms. Goodrich is described as the author of the books ``Merlin''
(named for Arthur's sorcerer) and ``King Arthur.'' Mitchell is
described as having conducted extensive research on the subject for
more than six years.

<HEAD>Head of Firm Implicated in Libyan Scandal Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAHR, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a Black Forest chemical
company suspected of helping Libya build a poison gas plant will
resign at the end of next month, the company announced Monday night.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen will leave his post as director of
the Imhausen-Chemie company of Lahr, spokesman Moritz Hunzinger told
reporters.
   Hippenstiel did not appear at the news conference and has not
been seen in public since mid-January, when suspicions mounted that
his firm organized construction and outfitting of a chemical weapons
plant in Rabta, Libya.
   No charges have been filed against anyone at Imhausen or other
West German firms said to have played a role in building the plant,
which Libyan officials say is intended to produce medicines.
   Imhausen officials said last month that Hippenstiel fled with his
family after receiving death threats, but he is believed to have
since returned to West Germany.
   His resignation, effective March 31, appears to be the result of
pressure from the federal Research and Development Ministry, which
refused to pay the firm for three projects it has under contract
with Imhausen as long as Hippenstiel remained in charge.
   The local parliamentary representative and business council also
demanded that Hippenstiel step down.
   Federal authorities have been investigating U.S. allegations that
Imhausen played a key role in the Rabta plant, but they say no
evidence has been uncovered that could stand up in court.
   Officials conceded privately they fear any incriminating evidence
may have been taken out of the country prior to the investigations,
which began months after U.S. officials first brought up the
Imhausen name with West German authorities.
   Company managing director Hans-Joachim Renner attempted suicide
in mid-February and remains hospitalized in critical condition.
   Hunzinger said Uwe Kunze, director of Cologne's Phospholipid
company, would take over Hippenstiel's job.

   Female agents of the Detroit office of the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have filed
complaints charging they have been victims of sex discrimination and
harassment.
   The complaints filed with the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission say women are denied promotions and
significant assignments, and are punished with unjustified
suspensions for complaining about it.
   ``The agency is run by reprisal,'' said Memphis, Tenn., civil
rights attorney Prather Randle, who is handling the complaints of
Detroit agents Vernon and Valerie Park, Sandra Davis and former
agent Kathleen Kubicki.
   Kubicki, a supervisor in Detroit until 1987, says she was demoted
and transferred for filing discrimination complaints.
   Mrs. Park said she suffered retaliation since complaining about
Davis being harassed, and her husband said his support of the women
brought him the same treatment.
   ATF officials said they couldn't discuss individual cases, but
said the agency has an affirmative action program for women and
minorities.
   Of 1,540 ATF agents nationally, 125 are female. In Detroit, there
are nine female agents and 69 males.
   Since 1983, 14 sex discrimination cases have been brought
nationwide by ATF employees and applicants, including four in which
an employee filed more than one complaint, the agency said. The
total excludes informal complaints, internal grievances and
ombudsman proceedings.

   John Patierno, who pioneered research and
development of the Air Force's new B-2 stealth bomber, has died of
cancer, Northrop Corp. officials said Monday. He was 54.
   Patierno died Satuday at Hoag Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach,
said Northrop spokesman Jim Hart.
   ``John was the father of the B-2 and guided the bomber's
development since its inception,'' Thomas V. Jones, chairman and
chief executive of Northrop, said in a statement.
   Jones said Patierno was one of America's most respected leaders
in advanced aeronautical design and development.
   The Newport Beach man spent 17 years developing the highly
classified aircraft designs and technology meant to enable stealth
aircraft to fly through enemy radar without being detected.
   For his work on stealth technologies, Patierno was honored by the
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics this year with
the Reed Aeronautics Award, the institute's highest honor.
   Patierno, the former corporate vice president and general manager
of Northrop's B-2 division in suburban Pico Rivera, spent 33 years
in aerodynamics.
   Patierno, a native of Clifton, N.J., is survived by his wife,
four children, his mother and a sister.

<TEXT>
   Black African leaders on Monday attacked
suggestions that the U.N. peacekeeping force in Namibia may buy or
lease military equipment from South Africa. Squabbles over
purchasing have delayed funding approval.
   On April 1, U.N. peacekeepers plan to begin implementing a
one-year plan for Namibia's independence from 74 years of South
African rule.
   U.N. officials have said they need make purchases from South
Africa, which lies on Namibia's southern border, to keep down the
cost of the mission that has a proposed budget of $416 million.
   Ambassador Isack Stanislaus Gorerazvo Mudenge of Zimbabwe,
representing the non-aligned movement, said Monday no need exists to
depend on South Africa for military equipment. He said he accepted
that South Africa dominates the economy of the region and said
peacekeepers could buy anything except military equipment from that
white-dominated nation.
   Zambian Ambassador Peter Dingiswayo Zuze, representing the black
African front-line states, joined Mudenge at the news conference.
   The front-line states border on South Africa or are particularly
concerned with events there. They are Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana,
Mozambique, Tanzania and Angola.
   Mudenge said dependence on South Africa may be unavoidable in the
early stages, ``but we expect them (the U.N. officials) to plan so
as to minimize that dependence.''
   The General Assembly's finance committee has been deadlocked over
the procurement issue since last week.
   The General Assembly has had to hold up approving the funding for
the Namibia force.
   Front-line states insist on inserting language into the funding
resolution referring to U.N. embargoes on buying military equipment,
oil or other goods from South Africa.
   The United States, Britain and France oppose including such
language.

   A comprehensive agreement to clean up the
nation's most contaminated nuclear weapons-production site was
signed Monday by the federal government and Washington state, but
the pact had no guarantee that money will be available to complete
the job at the Hanford nuclear reservation.
   At a signing ceremony, state and federal officials said the
``landmark'' agreement will provide a ``clear road map'' for
cleaning up the 570 square mile reservation in Washington state and
serve as a model for other Energy Department weapons plants.
   The department also made public Monday documents that estimated
five billion cubic yards of hazardous solid and liquid wastes, both
radioactive and toxic, have been disposed of at Hanford.
   The documents said that ``above-background concentrations'' of
such substances as tritium, Iodine-129, uranium and cyanide have
been found in the groundwater beneath the reservation and may
threaten the nearby Columbia River.
   ``These materials have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or
teratogenic effects on humans and other life forms,'' the documents
said, adding that there continue to be releases of hazardous
compounds.
   Under the agreement announced Monday, the department has promised
to seek $2.8 billion for the Hanford clean up over five years, but
the appropriation has yet to receive the blessing of the White House
budget office and will eventually have to be approved by Congress.
   After five years, the agreement calls for the state and the
Energy Department to sit down and come up with additional requests
to finance continued cleanup, which by department estimates could
cost $57 billion.
   ``We are extremely satisfied with the money provisions,'' said
Washington Gov. Booth Gardner.
   Key provisions of the ``Hanford Action Cleanup Action Plan''
include:
   _An accelerated program for actually cleaning up the reservation
over 30 years, rather than 50 years as originally envisioned.
   _Specific cleanup milestones. DOE could be fined up to $10,000
per week for failing to meet the milestones.
   _Clear delineation of duties between the state, the Energy
Department and the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
   _An agreement, which the Justice Department has agreed to,
allowing the state or members of the general public to enforce the
agreement by filing a lawsuit if necessary.
   In addition, the federal government has agreed to provide
Washington state $2.9 million over three years to fund the state's
oversight role.
   The agreement was reached after more than a year of negotiations
and amid threats that the state would go to court if negotiations
failed.
   Besides being the most contaminated of the Energy Department's 16
nuclear weapons-productions sites, the Hanford reservation is
expected to be the most costly to clean up and take the longest.
   J. Winston Porter, an assistant EPA administration, said the
Hanford site offers the ``toughest problems'' of any site.
   ``It will be the largest clean up in terms of time, cost and
complexity,'' said Porter.
   Stored at Hanford is more than 60 percent of the nation's
high-level radioactive waste generated by weapons programs dating
back to World War II.
   Scientists at the reservation worked on the bomb that was dropped
at Nagasaki. In the 1950s Hanford was one of the largest weapon's
production complexes.
   At present, only one commercial nuclear power plant is operating
at the reservation and the department has announced plans to phase
out all weapons production activities at the site.

<TEXT>
   The Sony Corp. of America refused to comment
Monday on published reports that the company was set to purchase
Columbia Pictures Entertainment.
   Trade newspapers Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter both
reported Monday that a Sony acquisition of the struggling film
studio was imminent.
   ``The deal is done,'' Variety quoted three ``well-placed
sources'' as saying. The Hollywood Reporter said industry
speculation hinted that Sony had ``cinched a deal to buy Columbia.''
   ``We have no comment on that item at this time,'' said Ronald
Petty, Sony's director of corporate communications.
   But, Petty added, ``It's a well-known fact ... we are looking to
get into the entertainment industry.''
   Last year, Sony completed its purchase of CBS Records for about
$2 billion.
   A spokesman for Columbia who asked not to be identified said the
studio wouldn't comment on the reports. Columbia is 49 percent owned
by Coca-Cola Co. of Atlanta.
   Rumors regarding Sony's buying a major film studio have
circulated in Hollywood for months, and the company has been linked
to MGM-UA as well as Columbia.
   The latter studio has labored through a flood of box-office
disappointments, including ``Punchline,'' ``Rocket Gibraltar,''
``The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking,'' ``Things Change'' and,
most recently, ``Physical Evidence.''

<HEAD>First Independent Blue Collar Union Formed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial workers have formed the first
independent blue-collar union in postwar Hungary, using Poland's
banned Solidarity as a model and intending to campaign for trade
union pluralism.
   About 500 men and women launched Workers' Solidarity during a
meeting Saturday, and the group plans to hold its founding meeting
in May, the official MTI news agency reported Monday.
   The union blamed the ruling Communist party for failing to live
up to one of its fundamental tenets _ the protection of workers'
rights.
   About half a dozen independent trade unions have sprung up in
Hungary over the past year. To date, however, they have been
dominated by white-collar workers rather than factory labor.
   The new union was formed amid a growing economic crisis in
Hungary, where living standards are falling as inflation reaches 20
percent.
   Meanwhile, a veteran Communist party member asked a party's
district committee in Budapest at an a weekend public debate that it
should take a stand in favor of the one-party system, the daily
Magyar Nemzet said Monday.
   Another party conservative, Gyula Sandor, secretary of a local
party chapter comprised of old age pensioners, claimed ``an open,
anti-communist aggression has been going on'' in Hungary.
   ``A section of the intellectual aristocracy, who is well off, is
waging an open struggle against us (communists),'' Magyar Nemzet
quoted Sandor as saying. He reportedly did not elaborate.

   Airlines worldwide were advised to check the
cargo doors of their Boeing 747s as federal investigators focused
Monday on the cargo door latch system of a United jumbo jet that
ripped open at 22,000 feet.
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said he thinks
``it's very important that we not jump to conclusions until that
report (on the investigation) is done.''
   ``The preliminary indications, of course, are that the (cargo)
door opened or at least the skin peeled around the door. But let's
wait until the board reports, then we'll know finally what went
on,'' Skinner said in an interview Monday with ABC's ``Good Morning
America.''
   United Airlines announced that it conducted detailed examinations
of all cargo doors in every plane in its fleet. Seven doors required
repairs, the airline said, but spokesman Rob Doughty said none of
the repairs was urgent.
   ``The items we repaired did not affect operating performance or
airworthiness,'' he said.
   United's Flight 811 was gaining altitude 100 miles south of here
after taking off for Auckland, New Zealand, early Friday when a
10-by-20-foot section of the fuselage ripped away, including the
right front cargo door.
   Nine passengers disappeared when 10 seats in the business class
on the right side were blown out through the gaping hole,
investigators said.
   There was no indication from the ground crew or cockpit crew that
anything was amiss when the cargo door was secured for flight, said
Lee Dickinson, a National Transportation Safety Board investigator.
   Dickinson said investigators have found no evidence of a bomb,
sabotage or metal fatigue that might have caused the mishap, and
``are focusing on and looking at the latching mechanism.''
   ``We're also trying to get a better handle on these latch pin
supports and comparing them to others,'' he said.
   The cargo bay door closed electrically, with eight latching
mechanisms along the bottom, attached to the plane's frame, as well
as a latching mechanism and a hook pin on each side, Dickinson said.
   Investigators determined Sunday that a warning system, that would
have alerted the cockpit crew if the door was not closed properly,
did work, Dickinson said at the NTSB's news briefing Sunday night.
   Boeing Co. on Sunday advised all airlines to check the cargo
doors of their 747s, and National Transportation Safety Board
investigators inspected the doors of other United 747s at Honolulu
International Airport the next day, Doughty said.
   Boeing said it has delivered 712 Boeing 747s of all types around
the world.
   ``What this is from us is by no means interfering or speculating
on the probable cause of the accident,'' Boeing Spokesman David
Jiminez said Monday. ``It's more of a prudent act on our part to
keep customers appraised of what we know.''
   United President Stephen Wolf said an FAA-licensed mechanic would
inspect each 747's cargo doors upon arrival and departure and would
oversee the closing of each cargo door before departure.
   In a statement issued from its Chicago headquarters, United said
it conducted detailed examinations Sunday and Monday of more than
900 cargo doors in its fleet of 399 aircraft, including Boeing 727s,
737s, 747s, and DC-10s made by McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   The seven repairs included repairing a 2-inch crack in the
doorframe of a 737, replacing a doorstop on a 737, replacing two
small brackets on a 747 latch mechanism and adjusting a DC-10 motor,
the statement said.
   ``All of these repairs ... would have been performed in the
normal course of maintenance,'' the statement said. ``Of more than
1,700 daily United flights, only two delays and one cancellation
were necessary.''
   Meanwhile, Doughty hailed the pilot of the crippled jet, Capt.
David M. Cronin, as a hero for controlling the craft.
   Cronin and the other 17 crewmembers of the plane have not been
allowed to talk to the media, Doughty said.
   ``Although we have nothing but praise for Capt. Cronin and the
rest the crew, we don't want anyone to draw conclusions about the
crash based on a brief interview,'' he said.
   Unions representing the flight and ground crews of Flight 811 are
working with investigators in an effort to reassure the public
following last Friday's incident, union leaders said Monday.
   ``Instead of seeing who might be blamed, it's our primary concern
to find out what happened and make sure we can keep it from
happening again,'' said Sam Poomaihealani, assistant general
chairman of District 141, International Association of Machinists.
The union represents all ground employes of United.
   A three-day search by Navy and Coast Guard ships and aircraft
resulted on the recovery of 57 pieces of debris that fell from the
plane, incuding airline seat cushions, an overhead compartment, a
section of fuselage, and personal itmes, including a teddy bear.
   Not recovered was the cargo door.
   ``Obviously, if we had the door it would be very helpful to us,''
Dickinson said, but said he was confident other information will
pinpoint the cause of the accident.
   Of the 354 people aboard the plane, incuding 18 crewmembers, 27
were treated at Honolulu hospitals, mostly for minor injuries caused
by flying debris. One was released from the hospital Monday, leaving
two still hospitalized.

   Fox Broadcasting Co. is moving its new
real-life police show ``COPS'' to its national network to boost its
anemic Saturday night schedule.
   ``COPS,'' which had been running at various times and days on
Fox-owned stations, will have a one-hour premiere at 9 p.m. on March
11 in place of ``Beyond Tomorrow.''
   It will move into its regular 9 to 9:30 p.m. time slot the
following Saturday. ``Beyond Tomorrow'' will be trimmed from an hour
to a half-hour and follow ``COPS.''
   Since its debut on the seven Fox-owned stations Jan. 7, ``COPS''
has received good ratings and critical praise.
   The reality show follows the personal and professional lives of
sheriff's deputies in Broward County, Fla. It uses no actors and has
no script.
   Fox's Sunday night schedule, led by ``Married ... With
Children,'' ``America's Most Wanted'' and ``21 Jump Street,'' has
scored impressive ratings.
   ``Married ... With Children'' has been beating such network shows
as ABC's ``Hooperman'' and ``thirtysomething'' and NBC's ``Miami
Vice.''
   The Saturday night schedule of ``The Reporters'' and ``Beyond
Tomorrow'' has consistently been at the bottom of the ratings, along
with ``Duet'' from Sunday night.

<TEXT>
   About 50 men disguised as soldiers raided
a ranch in search of a drug trafficker on Monday and killed 18
people, police said.
   The Colombian radio chain RCN speculated that the gunmen were
members of the country's largest leftist guerrilla group, the
Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces.
   A colonel with the national police, Carlos Francisco Hernandez,
said the gunmen arrived at the ranch, about 40 miles northwest of
Bogota, during a party and told guests they were looking for Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha.
   Rodriguez Gacha, nicknamed ``The Mexican,'' is said by the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agency to be a member of the so-called Medellin
Cartel, one of the two biggest drug trafficking groups in Colombia.
   The gunmen searched the ranch and unable to find Rodriguez Gacha,
they began killing bodyguards of a wealthy emerald dealer at the
party, Gilberto Molina, the colonel said in a communique.
   The bodyguards were handcuffed together and shot at point-blank
range with pistols and automatic assault rifles, he said.
   The dead included the ranch owner; the emerald dealer; 15 of his
bodyguards and a retired police colonel, Julio Cesar Martinez
Moncayo, who was the emerald dealer's chief of security, the
communique said.
   Guerrillas had said in communiques in recent months that the
emerald dealer and the drug trafficker had organized death squads to
kill peasants who sympathized with leftist rebels.
   Also Monday, a bomb exploded in the Bogota offices of a U.S.
missionary group, slightly injuring five people, the organization's
local director reported.
   National police said leftist guerrillas freed 11 policemen Monday
who were captured during a raid in early February.
   The bomb exploded at the Summer Institute of Linguistics, which
is based in Duncanville, Tex. Three Americans and two Colombians
suffered minor cuts, local director Abe Coop told The Associated
Press by telephone.
   RCN said an anonymous telephone caller claimed responsibility on
behalf of the leftist People's Revolutionary Army and warned of more
attacks on the institute.
   Summer Linguistics, which has operated in Colombia since 1962,
devises written languages for Indian tribes and translates the Bible
into those languages.
   Coop said the Americans injured Monday were Ken Pagel of El Paso,
Tex.; Jim Cartwright of Hartland, Mich., and Warren Storm of Tampa,
Fla.
   Guerrillas kidnapped and murdered one of the institute's
missionaries, Chester Bitterman, in Bogota in 1981, accusing him of
working for the CIA.
   Kidnappers seized two American missionaries from another
organization Jan. 10 in western Colombia. Those kidnapped were
Richard Grover of Minneapolis and Roy Libby of Atlanta, both of the
Colombian Evangelical Confederation.
   Hector Pardo, president of the group, said Monday no
communications had been received from the kidnappers. Pardo said he
assumed guerrillas were responsible because they oppose the presence
of missionaries in Colombia.
   The 11 policemen were captured Feb. 8 during an attack on
Valencia in Huila state, southern Colombia. At the time, police said
five officers were killed.
   A national police statement said the Colombian Revolutionary
Armed Forces, turned the 11 policemen over to Monsignor Jose Luis
Serna, a Roman Catholic bishop.
   It said they were freed near Pitalito, about 240 miles south of
Bogota, apparently in good health.

   A Chilean navy cutter and British repair
ship were on alert Monday against the threat of an oil spill from a
Peruvian research vessel that ran aground in Antarctica, officials
said.
   The British ice patrol ship Endurance earlier Monday rescued 64
scientists and sailors from the crippled vessel, the 1,980-ton
Humboldt, and took them to Chile's Marsh Base antarctic station,
according to the Chilean navy.
   In a communique, the navy said the Endurance tried unsucessfully
to lighten the Humboldt, which ran aground and began taking on water
after hitting rocks Sunday night off King George Island.
   In a second communique later Monday, the navy said some diesel
oil had spilled, creating a slick 150 yards by five yards. It said
that apparently two of the ship's four fuel tanks had split.
   A cutter from the Chilean navy, the Yelcho, was sent quickly
Monday from Punta Arenas, on the southern tip of the South American
continent, to ``lend all the necessary support both in efforts to
rescue the Humboldt and to control the pollution from the oil spill
that may occur,'' the navy said.
   The Humboldt is listing slightly to the right but is not in
danger of sinking, it said.
   A spokesman for the British navy said in London the repair ship
Stena Seaspread will stand by the stricken ship to monitor pollution
and help with any salvage work.
   The site is 300 miles from the area where the Argentine ship
Bahia Paraiso ran aground and sank Jan. 28, spilling fuel oil into
the region's usually pristine waters. The spill was cleaned up by
ships from the United States, Chile and Argentina. Damage to the
Antarctic environment is still being evaluated.

   A delegation from the opposition left
on Monday for talks with the presidents of Costa Rica and Venezuela,
seeking their support to make sure Nicaragua meets its obligations
under a Central American peace pact.
   Opposition leader Gilberto Cuadra said the presidents' backing
``is necessary, apart from our own efforts'' to ensure fair
elections in Nicaragua.
   The government party, the leftist Sandinista National Liberation
Front, already has begun what amounts to a veiled election campaign,
with President Daniel Ortega as the obvious candidate.
   Also Monday, Ortega sent the National Assembly a proposed decree
that would pardon 1,932 former members of ousted dictator Anastaso
Somoza's hated and feared national guard. The assembly will consider
the decree Tuesday.
   Cuadra heads the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, the most
important association of private business executives in Nicaragua,
and is a member of the delegation that left Monday.
   He said the delegates will meet with President Oscar Arias on
Tuesday in San Jose, the Costa Rican capital, and with President
Carlos Andres Perez in Caracas, Venezuela, on Thursday.
   Cuadra said they will discuss the accord which Ortega, Arias and
the presidents of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras reached at a
summit in El Salvador on Feb. 14.
   Ortega agreed then to institute reforms to guarantee free
elections, which he called to be held Feb. 25, 1990, 10 months ahead
of schedule. Nearly every elective post will be on the ballot, from
president and National Assembly deputies through town mayors.
   The five Central American presidents also agreed to draft by May
14 a plan to dismantle the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebel force. An
estimated 11,000 rebels, known as Contras, are living in camps with
their families in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border.
   While the opposition continues trying to form a united front _ by
all indications its only chance at winning the presidential race _
the Sandinistas are making it increasingly clear their nominee will
be Ortega.
   The first placards calling for Ortega to run for re-election
appeared at a rally Saturday in Masaya, 17 miles south of Managua.
   ``We will win the 1990 elections just like we won the 1984
elections,'' Ortega told the rally.
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge meanwhile was telling foreign
correspondents in Managua that the Sandinista Front had not yet
chosen a presidential candidate.
   Ortega said in a televised interview on Feb. 15 that running for
re-election ``is no sin,'' the closest he has come to saying he will
run for another term.
   Ortega had promised to release the former guardsmen at the Feb.
14 Central American summit.
   His decree names 1,932 ex-guardsmen convicted of ``crimes against
the people'' during the Somoza dictatorship that was overthrown by
the Sandinista revolution in 1979. The list includes 1,688
imprisoned ex-guardsmen and 244 who are either under house arrest or
free on conditional liberty.
   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said ``many former Somocista
guards will go free very soon, maybe tomorrow (Tuesday). The
Legislative Assembly of Nicaragua will decree very shortly the
liberty of those former national guardsmen.''
   He spoke to reporters Monday in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, where
he was attending a conference of foreign ministers from Latin
American and West European governments.
   The Defense Ministry said Monday that Honduran troops fired on
three Nicaraguan border outposts near Teotecancinte, about 112 miles
from Managua, on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. The ministry said
nothing about casualties.
   Honduran officials were not immediately available for comment on
the charges. Such allegations are frequent and usually denied by
Honduras.

<HEAD>Heavy Snow In North Carolina Mountains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a foot of snow fell in North Carolina on Monday as wet
weather prevailed from the lower Mississippi Valley to Virginia and
the Carolinas.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with clear
skies over the Florida Peninsula, much of new england and much of
the Southwest.
   The snowstorm stretching from eastern Kentucky and eastern
Tennessee to the middle Atlantic Coast left 14 inches of new snow on
Mount Mitchell in North Carolina, leaving a total of 21 inches on
the ground.
   A winter storm warning remained in effect for the mountains of
western North Carolina, and snow advisories were posted for
southeastern Kentucky, southern West Virginia, southwestern
Tennessee, most of Virginia, southern Maryland and southern Delaware.
   Light snow fell in the northern Rockies, northern Plains and the
upper Mississippi Valley. Redwood Falls, Minn., received 3 inches of
snow by Monday evening.
   In six hours ending at 7 p.m. EST, 2 inches of snow fell at
Fargo, N.D., and an inch fell at Binghamton, N.Y.; Great Falls and
Missoula, Mont., and Nashville, Tenn.
   A snow advisory was in effect for central and southeastern
Minnesota, and a a blowing snow advisory was issued for western
sections of the state. Advisories for snow and blowing snow was
posted for eastern North Dakota and northwestern Montana. The rest
of western Montana and much of central Montana were under a snow
advisory.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees at Detroit Lakes and Roseau, Minn., to 89 degrees at
Thermal, Calif.
   The forecast for Tuesday called for snow in the northern Rockies
and the northern High Plains and across much of the Great Lakes and
Ohio Valley; rain prevailing from the lower Mississippi Valley to
the Carolinas and the Middle Atlantic States and over the Pacific
Northwest; and fair to partly sunny skies prevailing in the rest of
the nation.
   Temperatures were expected to remain below freezing from the
northern Rockies to Nebraska and the Dakotas and in northern New
England, with highs in the teens from Montana to Minnesota and
northwest Michigan; above 50 degrees from California to much of
Texas and the southern Atlantic Coast; and in the 70s and lower 80s
from Southern California to the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas,
Florida and southern Georgia.

   MIAMI (AP _ Two firefighters were killed Monday in the battle
against a wildfire in central Florida, while other blazes scorched
miles of Everglades sawgrass and threatened a major power line that
serves the Miami area.
   The two volunteer firefighters from Bushnell, about 45 miles west
of Orlando, had just arrived at the scene of a mile-long grass fire
in the median strip of Interstate 75 when a tractor-trailer slammed
into their smoke-obscured pickup, crushing both men, the Florida
Highway Patrol said.
   Paul J. Reid, 20, was dead on the scene, while Ervin W. Fort, 33,
was airlifted to Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg, where he
was pronounced dead, the patrol said.
   The truck driver, Denver Lewis, 31, of Clarkton, Mo., was not
seriously injured, Sumter County Sheriff's Capt. James Fussell said.
The accident two miles south of Bushnell tied up southbound traffic
for about three hours.
   The firefighters were the first to die so far this wildfire
season. The last time a death occurred fighting a wildfire was more
than four years ago, state forestry officials said.
   A fire emergency was declared at midday by officials in both
Broward and Palm Beach counties, just north of Miami, placing all
available firefighters on alert.
   The largest of the wildfires engulfed 2,700 acres of the
Everglades in Broward County, and was a major concern because it was
approaching a major transmission line owned by Florida Power &amp;
Light, forestry officials said.
   Five to 10 miles of lines were threatened by Everglades fires
near U.S. 27 at the Palm Beach-Broward County line, said David
Utley, a state forestry duty officer.
   Stacey Shaw, a spokeswoman for FP&amp;L, said three 500-kilovolt
lines were taken out of service Monday morning when fires burned
into the corridor where they are located.
   The utility reactivated the lines after the blaze moved away from
them early Monday evening, state forester Peter Burke said.
   Firefighters were depending on weather conditions to help contain
the Everglades blaze after withdrawing from the area Monday evening,
Burke said.
   ``It will probably be burning overnight but we expect it will be
under control as the humidity rises, the winds die down, and the
temperatures get cooler,'' Burke said. ``I expect we'll be mopping
up hopefully tommorrow.''
   Charles Maynard, assistant chief of fire control at main division
offices in Tallahassee, said the Everglades fire was one of about
200 wildfires reported since Friday. Some were in Palm Beach County,
where ``we had a problem with arson,'' he said.
   The annual bout with brushfires started much earlier this year in
south Florida because rainfall has been about half the normal amount
since November.
   The Miami area has received 7{ inches of rain since September,
compared with an average rainfall of 24 inches for that period,
according to the National Weather Service.
   A fire which swept through 397 acres of grass and timberlands
forced the evacuation of some 200 people and closed a highway Sunday
in Putnam County in northeast Florida.
   Putnam County Sheriff's Sgt. Pat Westberry said residents were
allowed to return home early Monday. No homes or businesses were
damaged, he said.
   Arson was believed responsible for that fire, said Assistant
Palatka Fire Chief Owen Preston.

   A bomb killed one person and wounded seven Monday at a protest of
``The Satanic Verses'' in India, and Britain said Iran's order to
kill author Salman Rushdie was a ``fearful example of where
intolerance may lead.''
   Activists in Moscow demonstrated for Rushdie outside the Iranian
Embassy.
   In Karachi, Pakistan, a bomb exploded at the British Council
library while it was closed Sunday night, killing a guard.
   At least 18 people have been killed in India and Pakistan since
Feb. 12. Both countries have banned the novel.
   Syria said it banned ``The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems
consider blasphemous, a month ago and suspended all dealings with
Viking Penguin, the publisher. The Information Ministry said the ban
includes any other publishing house that translates or distributes
the book.
   Moslem theologians meeting in Mecca, the holy city of Islam,
branded Rushdie a ``heretic and a renegade'' Monday but did not
endorse murdering him. Islamic law condemns heretics to death, but
only after they are tried and refuse to repent.
   In London, the government refused a request by British Moslems to
extend the blasphemy law to all religions. It now covers only the
Anglican faith.
   Rushdie, 41, was born into a Moslem family in Bombay, India, but
has become a British citizen and does not actively practice
religion. The writer has been in hiding and under heavy police guard
since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered his death.
   He has apologized for any distress ``The Satanic Verses'' caused
Moslems, but Iran rejected the apology.
   A senior Viking Penguin editor attending an emergency meeting in
London of the Writers' Guild of Great Britain said Monday hardback
copies of the novel were selling so well that a paperback edition,
due out in August, may be delayed for ``crude commercial'' reasons.
   He denied reports that Viking Penguin might cancel the paperback
edition to appease Moslems.
   Khomeini, Iran's 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch, ordered his
followers Feb. 14 to kill Rushdie for blaspheming Islam and the
prophet Mohammed. Iranian clerics put a price of $5.2 million on the
author's head.
   Nigeria's Supreme Council of Moslems said Monday it supports the
death sentence. A Moslem student group in Africa's most populous
country also demanded action against Nigerian author Wole Soyinka,
the 1986 Nobel Literature laureate, for defending his fellow writer.
   About 300 Moslems demonstrated at the British consulate in Kaduna
in the Moslem-dominated north. They carried placards condemning
Rushdie and Soyinka, one of which said ``Soyinka Must Die.''
   Rushdie got support Monday from about 15 unofficial political
activists and journalists in Moscow who shouted ``Shame on Khomeini!
Shame on Islam!'' outside the Iranian Embassy.
   Soviet media have published reports from abroad about the
controversy but have not commented editorially, and the Kremlin has
said nothing.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, touring the Middle East,
met with Khomeini in Tehran on Sunday. Iran's official news agency
indicated they did not mention Rushdie or ``The Satanic Verses.''
   A statement distributed by the Moscow protesters said: ``While
all the civilized world is outraged'' by the death sentence, ``the
Soviet government as usual remains silent.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain was in Paris for a
summit with the French president, Francois Mitterrand, and told a
news conference that defending Rushdie ``is a fundamental matter of
freedom of speech.''
   ``We cannot have other people inciting their own citizens to
murder one of our citizens, and on that we had to be very firm,''
she said.
   Iran's parliament has scheduled a vote for Tuesday on whether to
break relations with Britain.
   Mitterrand told the journalists: ``In an affair of this kind,
when dogmatism and fanaticism create a totally irrational situation,
one must of course expect anything.''
   Michel Rocard, the French premier, said any demonstrations urging
violence against Rushdie would result in criminal charges.
   British chief delegate Henry Steel told the U.N. Human Rights
Commission in Geneva the Khomeini incitement to murder was a
``fearful example of where intolerance may lead'' and ``raises .. .
grave issues'' for the 43-nation commission, at which Iran has
observer status.
   The bomb in India exploded in Srinagar, summer capital of
Jammu-Kashmir state, where a crowd was trying to enforce a strike to
protest a confrontation Friday in Bombay. Police fireed into the
crowd in Bombay, killing nine people.
   Press Trust of India said the bomb was intended for police who
were trying stop demonstrators from forcing shops to close. The news
agency said a Moslem civilian was killed and a police officer was
among the wounded.
   Several protests have been held in India, particularly in
Jammu-Kashmir, the only state in the overwhelmingly Hindu nation
with a Moslem majority.
   Karachi police said an explosive device weighing about to pounds
went off at the British Council library. It demolished the guard
room, killing Mohammed Shafi, 65, and damaged a section of the
outside wall, they said.
   Britain's blasphemy law applies to material found to revile,
vilify or insult God, Jesus Christ, the Bible or the beliefs or
doctrines of Christian churches. In the most recent case, the
magazine Gay News and its editor were fined a total of $2,600 in
1977 for publishing a poem suggesting Jesus Christ was a homosexual.
It was the first prosecution for blasphemous libel since 1922.

<HEAD>South Carolina May Close Major Hazardous Waste Landfill To Other

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half the nation may be
temporarily prohibited from using South Carolina's hazardous waste
landfill beginning Wednesday, state health officials said Monday.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell said last month that he would shut the
state's borders March 1 to states seeking to dispose of hazardous
waste in South Carolina that they won't dispose of themselves.
   As of Monday, 27 states had not responded to the state Department
of Health and Environmental Control's request for information needed
to enact Campbell's order, officials said.
   The order affects the massive GSX hazardous waste landfill in
Sumter County east of Columbia, which now holds close to a billion
pounds of hazardous waste, about 70 percent of it from out of state.
The site is one of only two commercial hazardous waste landfills in
the Southeast and accepts roughly 135,000 tons of chemical garbage
annually. The other site is in Alabama.
   State health officials sent letters to all 50 states and Puerto
Rico informing them of Campbell's order and asking for information
on their waste handling laws by Feb. 15
   But by Monday afternoon, only 23 states had responded.
   Thirty-three states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia
used the facility in 1987, and South Carolina officials said some
states may not be responding because they will not be affected by
the order.
   But until they know about the states' policies, all states that
don't respond will be banned, said Hartsill Truesdale, head of the
health agency's hazardous waste division.
   Of the states that have responded, eight or nine have been
tentatively put on the list to be banned, which will be presented to
Campbell for approval.
   The list could change before Wednesday's deadline, or even
afterwards, as new information is received, Truesdale said.
   Campbell's staff initially said they expected the ban would fall
on nine states: North Carolina, Florida, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Kentucky, Louisiana and Kansas.
They estimated those states accounted for about 40 percent of the
waste going to GSX.
   Truesdale would not comment Monday on individual states, and said
the states now listed are not necessarily those suggested earlier by
the governor's office.
   Campbell, speaking from the National Governors Association
conference in Washington, said governors from North Carolina,
Florida and other states had approached him about his order.
   He said that states would have to certify they had no impediments
to disposal within their own borders or that the repeal of such
impediments was imminent in order to be allowed to continue burying
waste in South Carolina.
   ``Our policy has to be flexible enough to work with a state that
is genuinely moving to eliminate prohibitions,'' Campbell said.
   But, he said, ``I look for us to reach a point where there will
be some states that will be cut off.''

<TEXT>
   For the first time since 1984, herbicides
might be used again this year or next in national forests in
California to protect growth of commercial timber, a Forest Service
official said Monday.
   At the same time, Ray Weinmann, regional timber management
director, said he expected a legal challenge by ``zealots'' over
concern for possible threats to water supplies, humans and wildlife.
   Such challenges, currently under appeal, have stalled forest
herbicide use in Washington and Oregon.
   Production in the California region could drop an average of
about 20 percent without herbicide use, Weinmann said. He said the
California region represents annual production of about 1.7-1.8
billion board feet. A board foot is a unit of measure equal to a
board 1 foot square and 1 inch thick.
   ``We will limit the (health) risk to acceptable levels ... We
believe the risks are well within acceptable limits,'' he said.
``The decision is based on an environmental analysis of all the
factors relating to herbicide use.''
   The 50,000 acres slated for annual herbicide applications are
cut-timber country and forests burned in wildfires, he said,
promising that herbicides ``will only be used where other treatment
methods cannot do the job effectively.''
   Weinmann, demonstrating the level of favored herbicides, produced
a spray container of ``Weed-B-Gon,'' a consumer product. But printed
material handed reporters made clear that the service wasn't ruling
out the use of atrazine and 2,4-D, both under suspicion as possible
cancer-causing agents.
   Use of these agents, said the reports, would be ``last-choice''
and limited ``to sites where no other alternative will meet
management objectives.''
   Failure to take the described tough measures against competing
vegetation can cost as much as 300 million to 400 million board feet
of lumber annually, he estimated.
   The idea is to control certain clovers, brush and weeds that rob
trees of nutrition in a national forest-based industry that last
year produced enough lumber to erect ``a city the size of San
Francisco,'' said Weinmann.
   Before the moratorium in 1984, herbicides had been used in the
California national forests since the mid-1960s. The Forest Service
manages 20 million acres of California forest land, about a third in
commercial wood product production. Lumber companies pay to harvest
wood from national forests.
   ``We know there is going to be a challenge,'' he said. ``There
are some people who very sincerely and honestly believe that
herbicides are a poison that should not be used, and they are going
to take whatever aggressive actions they believe they should. We
have to deal with them when they come up.''
   He called such people ``zealots.''

   A pool of 90 potential jurors was called to U.S. District Court
for the case against six reputed members of the Genovese crime
family.
   The six are charged in a racketeering conspiracy that includes
controlling labor unions, extortion in the construction industry,
loansharking, illegal gambling, several murders and a conspiracy to
kill John Gotti, the reputed boss of the rival Gambino family, and
his brother, Gene.
   The trial is expected to provide a broad, detailed look at the
workings of a major organized crime family.
   The Gottis' names were listed among 100 people and businesses on
a questionnaire passed out to jury prospects, who were asked if they
were familiar with the names.
   Jury selection is expected to continue for the remainder of the
week.
   On trial are reputed Genovese ``consigliere,'' or No. 3 leader,
Louis A. ``Bobby'' Manna, 59, of Jersey City; his alleged deputy,
restaurateur Martin ``Motts'' Casella, 71, of Secaucus; Richard
``Bocci'' DeSciscio, 42, of Bayonne, termed an enforcer for the
group; Rocco J. Napoli, 42, of Secaucus; John Derrico, 27, of
Hoboken; and Frank ``Dipsy'' Daniello, 67, of Hoboken.
   All have pleaded innocent and deny involvement in organized crime.
   Judge Maryanne Trump Barry ordered that the jury remain anonymous
because of the nature of the charges.

   Leaders of the nation's largest group of
school administrators voted Monday to urge principals around the
country to avoid programs which force commercials into the classroom.
   ``We know selling junk food in the cafeteria is bad nutrition,
and we know it's bad education to bring commercials into the
classroom,'' Scott Thomson, executive director of the National
Association of Secondary School Principals, said after the 18-0 vote
by the group's board of directors.
   The board voted to urge schools not to participate in ventures
disguising commercials as learning programs and to oppose ads which
students must watch or which replace instruction time.
   Although the program wasn't mentioned, spokesman Lew Armistead
said the vote was a reaction to plans for ``Channel One,'' a daily
12-minute news show including up to two minutes of ads.
   ``We think it's a premature response. The program has not even
been aired,'' said Christopher Whittle, chairman and founder of
Whittle Communications LP of Knoxville, Tenn., which plans to test
the show at six schools in early March.
   ``We're conducing an entire battery of research to find out what
educational value it has, to find out the effects of commercials, if
any, on teen-agers,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Whittle Communications gives schools about $50,000 of electronics
equipment in exchange for an agreement that the satellite-carried
program will be shown to students every day.
   Whittle said Walter Cronkite told the association in 1980 that a
daily news program should be beamed to high schools.
   ``He said the only question is funding. His attempt to do that,
getting major corporations to put up the money, failed,'' said
Whittle.
   ``Furthermore, let's find out what's the alternative plan,'' he
said. ``Meaning, how do the critics expect education to be funded if
new ideas aren't allowed to even be tested.
   ``If you're going to get real funding from business, business is
going have to get real results,'' Whittle said. ``When you talk
about small dollars, yes, maybe business is going to provide it.
When you talk about real dollars, it's going have to be quid-pro-quo
partnerships.''
   Thomson, a former social studies teacher, said his major
objection at first was the idea of bringing advertisements into the
classroom. But after seeing a preview segment, he said, he was even
more set against ``Channel One.''
   ``After I reviewed the program, I became more concerned about the
superficiality of the curriculum,'' Thomson said.
   ``It results in pop social studies. That's not the right way to
get students to understand concepts and have basic information,'' he
said.

   Are you ready for a comedy about big-gun
classical composer Gustav ``Gus'' Mahler and his friendship with a
modern-day playwright who is not unlike author Albert ``Al''
Innaurato?
   You'll get both of them in ``Gus and Al,'' Innaurato's strange
comic fantasy that opened Monday at off-Broadway's Playwrights
Horizons.
   Innaurato's weird tale of time-travel begins in New York 1989 and
then jumps backwards to Vienna 1901. Al, who is fat, 40 and gay, has
fled his problems in the present to help his hero Mahler confront
difficulties in the past.
   And Mahler does have his troubles _ an overbearing sister as well
as a mad housekeeper Natalie who is in love with him. She is jealous
of his romancing the bossy Alma Schindler who later becomes his wife.
   Much of the bickering between the composer and his female
entourage in Act 1 is tedious. Mahler or music buffs might find some
fun in Innaurato's inside jokes about the composer. Others may find
it pretentious, especially when the playwright suggests there is a
similarity between the two artists, both, according to Innaurato,
unappreciated in their own time.
   The second act perks up considerably when Al meets Camillo, his
Italian grandfather as a young man before he emigrates to America.
The link between past and future is forged sweetly and with a great
deal of humor. It's a fascinating conceit and one that is more
interesting than the rest of the play.
   Mark Blum, padded with stuffing, turns the hefty and neurotic
playwright into an appealing character. Sam Tsoutsouvas as the
driven composer is a model of the frustrated, unfulfilled artist,
but his trio of female tormentors, Cara Duff-MacCormick, Christina
Moore and Jennifer Van Dyck, are all variations of the same
unattractive shrew. Bradley White turns Al's ancestor into an
attractive, common-sense individual in contrast to all the loonies
swirling around him.
   Still, Innaurato has a fine sense of the bizarre, particularly
when he is dealing with his frustrated playwright. ``Gus and Al''
would have been twice as good if only it had concentrated on half
its title characters.

<TEXT>
   Angry mobs across Venezuela set fire to
cars and buses, battled police and national guardsmen and looted
hundreds of stores on Monday to protest increases in gasoline prices
and transportation fares.
   The wave of riots injured at least 200 people alone in Caracas
and the Guarenas shantytown 30 miles east of the capital, a police
report said. Rioting broke out in at least seven cities and towns
and independent reports estimated damage nationwide to be in the
millions of dollars.
   Sackings continued in downtown Caracas at nightfall and public
transportation ground to a halt, leaving about 100,000 commuters
stranded, officials said. Many employees remained in their offices,
while a pitched battle went on between police and looters.
   ``It is a popular uprising. There are riots everywhere. They are
all furious,'' Metropolitan Police Inspector Jose Lara Montilla, who
commanded a police unit armed with shotguns in downtown Caracas,
told an Associated Press reporter.
   All 6,000 policemen in Caracas were mobilized, said Alex
Martinez, deputy police commissioner.
   Riots were reported across the country and authorities broadcast
appeals for calm. No official figures were available on deaths or
injuries.
   A 32-year-old pregnant woman was fatally shot in Guarenas,
according to a reporter for the newspaper La Voz de Guarenas,
quoting police sources who gave no further details.
   Television showed rioting in Maracaibo, San Cristobal, Valencia
and Puerto La Cruz, among other cities.
   Police helicopters were seen flying over the capital trying to
disperse rock-hurling mobs. In the downtown area of El Silencio,
site of the AP offices, almost all the stores were sacked. In the
twin Simon Bolivar towers, home of several ministries, not one shop
window was left intact.
   ``Every single business around here has been sacked and
destroyed,'' said Victor Hugo Carvajal, an AP reporter who has lived
in Venezuela since 1973. ``It is the worst I have ever seen.''
   The outburst turned Caracas into one solid traffic jam.
   By all accounts, the violence occurring during the new
administration of Social Democratic President Carlos Andres Perez
was the worst this usually peaceful, oil-producing nation has
suffered in decades.
   Interior Minister Alejandro Izaguirre warned in a national TV
address that the government would not tolerate further public
disorder. ``Burning buses and cars, lootings and sackings of shops
are not the expression of a democratic society. We will not tolerate
this,'' he said.
   He said the increases were ``not capricious, but mandated by
necessity. ... The government was compelled to dictate economic
measures given the seriousness of an unprecedented economic crisis.''
   The Caracas bus terminal of Nuevo Circo (New Circus) became a
battlefield between police and mobs. Officers fired tear gas.
Rioters set cars and buses ablaze. Hundreds of passangers who were
waiting for transportation to neighboring areas fled in panic.
   At nightfall the police had cordoned off the terminal area, where
about 500 buses and taxis daily transport at least 100,000
commuters. Most of the commuters are workers who live in Maracay and
Valencia.
   The fury spilled over Monday morning as new transport fares went
into effect, in many cases doubling previous bus rates, as a result
of gasoline price increases of more than 100 percent.
   The round-trip fare between Guarenas and Caracas went up from 16
to 32 bolivars (roughly from 41 cents to 82 cents). In monthly
terms, it represents roughly a quarter of the minimum salary
included in the economic package announced two weeks ago by the
government of Perez, inaugurated on Feb. 2.
   The government hopes to end subsidies on such necessities as
transportation, food and housing.
   ``We cannot stand this. We are already half-starving. The new
rates condemn us to eat nothing,'' said Carlos Rodriguez, 45, who
works in a shop in downtown Caracas.
   Venezuela's economy, prosperous during the 1970s, is now trapped
in a deep recession because of persistently weak oil prices and a
$33-billion foreign debt.
   The country is also set to sign this week a letter of intent with
the International Monetary Fund for a $1.5 billion credit.
   Around 120 people were injured, including 14 policemen, when
looters formed human chains to face national guard units firing
birdshot from armored cars, said reporter Igor Camacho.
   Three guardsmen were hurt by rocks thrown by students in Merida,
more than 300 miles southwest of Caracas. Stores were trashed and
vehicles set ablaze.
   ``It's an outright battle between students and the national
guard,'' said Ramon Suarez, a reporter for the newspaper Frontera in
Merida, home to the 10,000 students of the University of the Andes.
Tanks patrolled the streets.
   Students took the state governor, Orlando Guttierez, prisoner for
about an hour Monday when he approached rioters in an attempt to
talk with them.
   The national guard, part of the Defense Ministry, is used for
internal security.
   In Maracay, 60 miles east of Caracas, rioting students told
reporters to stay away or their cars would be burned, said Orolis
Rodriguez of the newspaper El Siglo. She said students blocked land
transport between Caracas and Maracay, threatening to burn buses and
cars.

   As riots swept Venezuela, looters in
Caracas braved police and army units patrolling the streets and
seized their chance to raid hundreds of stores.
   ``We've got orders to arrest, not to kill,'' said a police
officer. ``But that could change.''
   The crisis facing the new government of President Carlos Andres
Perez was the worst in 30 years of democratic rule in Venezuela.
   Hundreds of Venezuelans looted stores in downtown Caracas, blocks
from government offices, breaking windows and carting off
merchandise ranging from air-conditioners to jewelry.
   ``Government!,'' shouted a young man, warning others of the
approach of a jeepful of rifle-toting police.
   Police fired in the air, but looters defied orders to stop and
continued to rampage. They finally scattered into nearby buildings
as gunfire continued.
   No figures emerged on injuries or arrests, but a police officer
estimated at least 100 police were injured by rocks and home-made
explosives.
   Television stations estimated 40 civilians were wounded in
Caracas by birdshot fired by police.
   One looter carted away a washing machine.
   ``I'm doing this because everybody else is,'' he said.
   ``The last time I saw this was the 23rd of January, 1958, the
fall of the dictator,'' said German Guedes, a toothless, old man,
pulling on a new pair of shoes inside a building as firing persisted
outside.
   Venezuelan strongman Gen. Marcos Perez Jimenez was toppled in
1958, leading to 30 years of stable, democratic rule.
   A woman caught in the cross fire as she tried to get home
complained that the looters were criminals taking advantage of what
started out as a protest by students against increased public
transportation tariffs.
   ``They're just criminals, robbing, burning. I've never seen
anything this bad,'' she said, crying.
   Major avenues across the city, with buses blazing, looked like
movie scenes of hell. Fires in poor neighborhoods in the hills on
the outskirts of the city burned through the afternoon and evening.
   Sculptor Carlos Mendoza said residents of one wealthy
neighborhood stood on street corners and exchanged impressions of
the violence, the first time he'd seen people in the neighborhood
come out of their houses to talk to each other.
   Police said they expected the government to declare a state of
emergency, but observers said the looting and riots across the
country caught officials by surprise.
   ``They don't want to send out the national guard because they
don't want repression,'' said a police officer. But as he spoke,
national guard riot troops with plastic shields patrolled a nearby
street.
   ``The government doesn't know how to respond. We've never had
this kind of thing before,'' said a young man.
   When asked what he would do if the situation continued, he said
he would probably join the looters.

   John Demjanjuk, the retired auto worker
convicted of being the sadistic Nazi death camp guard ``Ivan the
Terrible,'' said Monday that he hasn't given up hope three years
after being deported to Israel.
   ``I feel OK ... I'm waiting,'' Demjanjuk said in a telephone
interview with WJW-TV of Cleveland. ``It's hard for me waiting
because it's a long time. But you know I feel that everything will
be OK because I'm the wrong man.''
   Demjanjuk became the first American sent to Israel to stand trial
for Nazi war crimes three years ago on Monday. Last April, he was
sentenced to death after being convicted of being ``Ivan the
Terrible,'' who operated the gas chambers at the Treblinka death
camp in Poland.
   Demjanjuk is appealing the conviction.
   Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian immigrant who settled in the Cleveland
suburb of Seven Hills after World War II, said it has been difficult
for him to be separated from his family. He has spent the past three
years in a Jerusalem prison and six weeks ago his second grandchild
was born.
   ``This is hard, and I already have (a) grandson and granddaughter
(who) I don't see,'' he said. ``I miss family; I miss my other
friends; I miss all the people from Cleveland.
   ``The world should be learning what is true ... the world knows
... I know the world knows already. Everybody prays for me, and I
pray for myself, and I think God helps me show the truth.''
   Demjanjuk's appeal has been delayed until next fall because one
of his Israeli attorneys committed suicide and another, Yoram
Sheftel, is recovering from an eye injury he received when an
Israeli Holocaust survivor threw acid at him.
   ``I worry about him (Sheftel) you know that it won't happen a
second time,'' Demjanjuk said.
   Family members are still attempting to raise money for
Demjanjuk's defense and to find evidence that will help in his
appeal.
   ``We're working as hard as ever every single day to get at the
information that we know exists to prove his innocence,'' said
Demjanjuk's son, John Jr.

   A strong earthquake was recorded Tuesday in an
isolated area of the south Pacific off the Molucca Islands, the Hong
Kong Observatory reported.
   The quake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale struck at 7:44 a.m.
(6:44 p.m. Monday), observatory said, and was centered in the sea
just north of the Moluccas, an Indonesian island chain.
   The observatory had no additional details.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
and each increase of one number means ground motion is 10 times
greater.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in a populated
area, while one of magnitude 7 is capable of causing widespread and
heavy damage.

   Lech Walesa told a rally Monday that
round-table talks with the government are at the halfway mark and
``new obstacles keep appearing every day.'' But he remained upbeat
and he begged young Poles to show restraint.
   Walesa spoke to 7,000 people in southwest Poland in the latest of
a series of appearances to build support for his still-outlawed
Solidarity free trade union movement.
   Walesa expressed hope the government would make ``new,
further-reaching political decisions'' necessary to allay the
difficulties.
   In the meantime, he asked young people to use restraint when
demonstrating, saying, ``I am begging you on my knees.''
   The 1983 Nobel Peace laureate appeared to be referring to student
unrest over the weekend. Young people demanding legalization of the
banned Independent Students Association, or NZS, clashed with police
in Krakow. Authorities said 39 police were injured.
   On Monday, 2,000 student supporters of NZS rallied in front of
Krakow's Jagiellonian University and declared a 48-hour boycott of
classes, said an opposition spokesman in the city, Zygmunt Lenyk.
   Negotiators in Warsaw meanwhile reported progress Monday on the
question of legalizing the NZS, which is the campus equivalent of
Solidarity, and which like Solidarity was banned after Poland's 1981
martial-law crackdown.
   Both sides agreed to consider a declaration of intention to
legalize the NZS and several other groups banned because of their
support for Solidarity, said NZS representative Piotr Czerwiec.
   But government spokesman Jerzy Urban, appearing on state
television, said legalization ``must depend'' on whether NZS leaders
disassociate themselves from violent or anti-Soviet protests.
   Authorities have agreed in principle to restore legal status to
Solidarity and to a parallel union for farmers, Rural Solidarity.
   The unprecedented round-table talks among representatives of
authorities, the opposition and the official trade union alliance
OPZZ began Feb. 6 and were expected to last about three more weeks.
   The talks aim for a new ``social contract,'' in which the
opposition would promise social peace and participation in official
institutions such as Parliament in exchange for legalization of
Solidarity and adoption of other political and economic reforms.
   ``The round-table is midway, but new obstacles keep appearing
every day,'' Walesa told a legal rally in Wroclaw. ``It demands new,
further-reaching political decisions. I believe that they will take
place.''
   Opposition negotiators in Warsaw expressed annoyance that
Parliament took action Friday on subjects that were still under
negotiation at the round table.

   A man was sentenced to five life prison
terms Monday for murdering his brother-in-law, his sister-in-law and
two of their children on an Indian reservation on Michigan's Upper
Peninsula.
   ``Society must be protected,'' U.S. District Judge Robert Holmes
Bell told Vincent Loonsfoot. ``I order you confined to a federal
facility for the rest of your natural life.''
   Loonsfoot, who was silent and showed no emotion, was convicted
Dec. 9 of four counts of first-degree murder, kidnapping, possession
of a firearm during a crime of violence and of felony possession of
a firearm.
   Loonsfoot, 26, shot David Smith, 29, Sherry Smith, 27, and their
daughters, Amy, 10, and Laura, 2, on the Hannahville Indian
Reservation last June 14.
   The sole survivor was the couple's daughter Amanda, 11. After the
shootings, Loonsfoot abducted his estranged wife, Peggy, and took
her with him for 10 days in remote Delta County before turning
himself in.
   Bell sentenced Loonsfoot to four life prison terms for each
murder, and a fifth life term for possession of a firearm during a
violent felony. He also sentenced Loonsfoot to 12 years in prison
for kidnapping, and another five years for felony possession of a
firearm.
   All but the five-year term are to run concurrently. The five-year
term is to run consecutively.
   Defense attorney Dennis Girard said he would appeal to the 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.

<TEXT>
   Residents of a northwestern New Mexico city
pleaded for anti-alcohol legislation Monday at the end of a 200-mile
march to the state Capitol that was spurred by a fatal accident
caused by a drunken driver.
   More than 1,000 people joined the couple dozen marchers and heard
pledges of support from Gov. Garrey Carruthers, Gallup Mayor Edward
Munoz, Navajo Nation Vice Chairman Johnny Thompson and others.
   Later, the state Senate heard a series of emotion-filled speeches
and testimonials describing the alcoholism problem in Gallup, a city
of about 18,000 peole in northwestern New Mexixo near the Arizona
border.
   ``We could walk from here to China and it wouldn't do a bit of
good unless we had the support of the people to enact the laws,''
Munoz told the Senate.
   The march, which began Feb. 17, was dubbed the Journey for Jovita
after an infant who was killed in an alcohol-related traffic
accident in January.
   The National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse has
reported that surrounding McKinley County's rate of alcohol-related
deaths per 100,000 people was nearly six times the U.S. average from
1975 to 1979.
   The marchers asked lawmakers to support anti-alcoholism
legislation, including a liquor tax to fund alcohol-rehabilitation
programs, funding for a detoxification program and a ban on drive-up
windows at liquor stores.
   Although only a couple of dozen walked most of the 200-mile trip
from Gallup to Santa Fe, groups from Indian schools and pueblos and
other McKinley County residents joined the group for the final few
miles to the Capitol.

<HEAD>Dallas Teen Arrested in New York for Killing Mom</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Texas teen-ager was arrested Monday at a
Manhattan shelter for runaway children and charged with the shotgun
murder of his mother, whose body was found stuffed in a garbage can
earlier this month.
   Mario Reid, 18, of Dallas, is also wanted for questioning in the
disappearance of his stepfather, said Dallas police Detective Robert
Alexander. Police believe the stepfather is dead, although his body
has not been found and the teen has not been charged in that case.
   Reid was jailed pending his transfer to Texas, said Detective
John Clifford, a New York police spokesman. Authorities were unsure
whether the teen planned to waive extradition proceedings or when he
would be returned to Dallas.
   The teen had spent the weekend at Covenant House, telling workers
there his mother had died several months earlier of a heart attack
and he didn't know where his father was, said John Kells of the
shelter.
   ``He looked like the average runaway kid,'' said Kells. ``He did
what the other kids do here on weekends _ read books, eat, sleep.''
   Reid was arrested Monday after officials at the shelter near
Times Square discovered he was wanted for murder and called city
police, said Clifford. Dallas police contacted Covenant House after
staffers there called Texas to get background on Reid, said Kells.
   The teen-ager arrived at the shelter Friday, Clifford said.
   Dallas police believe Reid shotgunned his mother, 37-year-old
Marie King Dials, and stuffed her into a garbage can at an
elementary school two blocks from their home, said Alexander. Her
body was found Feb. 7, but she was not identified until eight days
later.
   Police then searched the family's home and found evidence that
the teen's stepfather, Robert Dials, 44, had also been killed, said
Alexander. The search for his body continues, ``but we believe he is
deceased,'' the detective said.
   A warrant was subsequently issued for Reid's arrest.
   Family members told Dallas police that Reid was ``fascinated with
death, Satan worshipping and that type of thing,'' said Alexander.
Police have not determined a motive in the slaying, he said.

   Two brothers accused of masterminding a $1
billion operation to launder cocaine profits were honest gold
bullion dealers, an attorney said Monday after winning postponement
of their bail hearing.
   The lawyer for Nazareth Andonian told a magistrate that evidence
indicating the two men's innocence should be considered before bail
is decided.
   U.S. Magistrate John Kronenberg scheduled the bail hearing for
next Monday.
   The government has asked that Andonian and his brother, Vahe, be
held without bail on grounds that they were key figures in an
international cocaine money laundering scheme centered in the Los
Angeles wholesale jewelry mart.
   More than 40 persons have been arrested so far in the government
investigation code-named Polar Cap, which was revealed last week.
   Defendants were charged with aiding the distribution of thousands
of pounds of cocaine by laundering up to $1 billion in cash. The
money, packed like bricks and shipped by armored car, was generated
from cocaine sales in Los Angeles, New York, Houston and other
cities, authorities said.
   The complaint alleged the funds were counted, deposited in banks
and wire transferred to South America for purchase of more cocaine.
   But attorney Allan Sigel, representing Nazareth Andonian, said
outside court that the government may have been misled by informants
in the drug trade.
   ``They have a snitch, an informant, who finds himself in great
difficulty and in exchange for freedom will say anything,'' said
Sigel.
   An affidavit filed in federal court shows that the probe of
wholesale jewelers began with a tip from an informant in Uruguay who
told an agent about the alleged money laundering operation.
   ``The complaint is inference and innuendo because of the
government view that they (the Andonians) have large amounts of
unexplained cash,'' said Sigel.
   But he added that, ``One who deals in gold bullion deals in huge
amounts of cash. It's quite common to deal in millions of dollars in
the gold business.''
   Thus, he said that government surveillance videotapes which
showed employees counting vast amounts of cash at Andonian Brothers
Manufacturing Co. may reflect legal activities.
   Sigel said he would show at the bail hearing next Monday that the
Andonians were ``men of modest circumstances'' who made a legitimate
living by brokering gold at a modest commission.
   He said the Andonians are worth less than $500,000 each, that
each man owns a $250,000 home and ``they make car payments like the
rest of us.''
   He said the Andonians, American citizens who are of Lebanese and
Syrian descent, have been active in community and church affairs and
that religious leaders were anxious to vouch for them in court.

<TEXT>
   A California businessman testified
Monday that he saw a Navy sergeant take a bribe to release an
overcrowded tourist boat on New Year's Eve that sank minutes later,
killing 55 people.
   Peter Tripp, an electronics equipment dealer from Beverly Hills
who was on the fateful cruise, told police he was ``certain'' he had
seen one of cruise's organizers pay off a Navy port authority
official who stopped the vessel as it headed for a fireworks display
on Rio's famous Copacabana beach.
   The double-decked Bateau Mouche IV was carrying an estimated 150
people, three under its legal limit, when it flipped over and sank
minutes before midnight. A Navy report later said the boat could not
safely carry more than 62 people.
   In a sworn statement given to Special Investigator Wladimir
Sergio Reale of the Rio de Janeiro state civil police department,
Tripp said a Sgt. Braga of the Port Authority was counting
passengers when a fat bearded man named Mr. Garcia gave him money.
   Francisco Garcia Riveiro, an owner of the Itatiaia Turismo travel
agency that hired the Bateau Mouche IV for the cruise, was briefly
arrested last month, along with the boat's owners, and then
released. Also questioned at that time was Port Authority Sgt.
Antonio Braga Vasconcellos, who boarded the boat for an inspection
but denied taking money.
   The accident caused a national outcry and demands for the
punishment of those responsible. The Bateau Mouche, which sold
tickets at $220 apiece, tipped over amid what survivors said was
overcrowding aggravated by rough water, with life preservers hard to
find or tied down.
   The Rio de Janeiro state government, which has vowed to
aggressively prosecute the case, paid for a first-class round-trip
ticket for Tripp, 40.
   Riveiro's lawyer, Nilo Batista, said Tripp's deposition ``wasn't
worth a second-class ticket on a train.''

<HEAD>Seven Granted Asylum In First Week Of Rapid Processing Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAYVIEW, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first week of a crackdown on political
asylum applications ended Monday with approvals granted to only 2
percent of those applying, federal officials said.
   Of 329 applications submitted here, seven have been approved for
asylum since Tuesday, when the Immigration and Naturalization
Service sped up its procedures for handling asylum applications.
   Under the new procedures, all applications are processed in a
single day, but those whose applications are rejected are subject to
immediate arrest and detention and are marked for deportation.
   All seven approved for refugee status are from Nicaragua, said
Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for the agency's Harlingen District at
the southern tip of Texas.
   Political asylum is granted to people who are judged to be
fleeing persecution. The INS instituted its new policy because it
believes most of the emigrants are traveling to the United States
for economic reasons.
   The number of applicants has plunged since the new get-tough
procedure began. INS examiners processed 233 last Tuesday, 51
Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 19 Friday and 16 Monday.
   Two weeks ago, when applicants still were able to travel on to
their U.S. destinations to pursue their cases, the agency was seeing
500 a day.
   Things have slowed down so much that some of the extra personnel
brought in last week to carry out the new procedures went home
Monday, said Al De Leon, assistant district director for
examinations. Twenty-six examiners left Monday, he said, leaving 24
here to process cases.
   One of two State Department personnel on hand since last week to
issue advisory opinions on the cases left Thursday, according to the
INS.
   Sixteen cases processed Monday resulted in 11 denials of asylum,
four approvals and one notice of ``intent to deny,'' meaning that
person was given 15 days to supply improved documentation to bolster
a borderline case.
   An exact number of people affected by the decisions was
unavailable because dependants sometimes file jointly with the
principal applicant, Ms. Kice said.
   The number of people detained as a result of the new procedure
was unavailable, but the inmate count at an immigration service
detention center on Monday was double the population of a week ago.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state will soon begin voluntary AIDS
testing for convicts leaving the New York prison system, Corrections
Commissioner Thomas Coughlin said Monday.
   Any inmate being released from prison can be tested at their
request, under the program administered by the Corrections, Health
and Parole departments, he said. The program is set to begin April 1.
   Currently, only inmates who exhibit symptoms of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome or who are considered high-risk AIDS candidates
may be tested voluntarily.
   Under the new program, any departing inmate who tests positive
for the AIDS virus will be referred to counseling and health
services, Coughlin said.
   The test is ``kind of a backhanded way of seeing if there is any
(AIDS) transmission'' in the prisons, said the commissioner, who
discussed the new testing program during a joint legislative hearing
on the 1989-1990 prisons budget.
   Coughlin said he doesn't believe AIDS is spread among inmates.
   ``I think there is sexual activity and I think there is drug
abuse going on, ... but I don't think that you're going to find
massive transmission of the AIDS virus within the prison system,''
he said.
   The AIDS epidemic has not exploded within the prison system, as
some people expected, Coughlin said.
   ``Everybody said four, five years ago that the prisons would have
thousands and thousands of AIDS cases,'' Coughlin said. ``But it
just hasn't happened.''
   The AIDS patient rate has remained constant, at about three per
thousand, for three years, he said. There are now about 400 inmates
with AIDS symptoms.
   Coughlin gave the AIDS education program for all inmates partial
credit for averting an explosion of AIDS in the prisons.
   However, he said he's still preparing for an increase in inmate
AIDS cases ``because of the number of drug abusers we have in the
system.''
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   Two buses collided head-on in the outskirts of
the capital Monday, killing 16 people and seriously injuring seven,
after one of the vehicles struck a motorcyclist and lost control,
police said.
   The motorcyle rider ran a stop sign and crossed the intersection
in front of a small bus, whose driver tried to avoid the motorcycle
but hit it. The bus careened into a full-sized bus coming in the
opposite direction.
   Police said the small bus was traveling at excessive speed and
carrying 22 passengers, five more than its legal capacity.
   All of those killed were riding in the smaller bus, as were all
those seriously hurt, with the exception of the motorcyclist, police
said.

   Three soldiers and seven Maoist guerrillas
were killed when rebels ambushed an army truck on a mountain road
near this state capital, officials said Monday.
   Five soldiers and ``numerous'' rebels were wounded in the
fighting Sunday at an isolated spot in Peru's southern highlands, a
military communique said.
   Elsewhere, authorities said security forces fatally shot five
suspected members of the Shining Path guerrilla group on Monday when
they burst into a house on the outskirts of Huancayo, a major city
in the central Andes 140 miles east of Lima.
   Civilian court officials said about 20 police and soldiers
wearing hoods barged in after receiving information guerrillas were
using it as a safe house.
   The local district attorney's office said it was not clear if the
five young men were armed. Police and the military refused to
provide information on the shooting.
   In other violence, police said Shining Path rebels on Monday
killed the mayor of Mantaro, a district 20 miles north of Huancayo.
They said two men and a woman shot Teodoro Tovar, a member of the
governing center-left Aprista Party.
   A military communique issued in Ayacucho said the guerrilla
ambush of the army truck occurred shortly before nightfall Sunday 20
miles northeast of Ayacucho. The provincial capital lies 235 miles
southest of Lima.
   The report said a truck carrying 15 soldiers to the nearby army
post of Julcamarca was caught in a cross fire by about 50 rebels
positioned on slopes above the road.
   The wounded were evacuated to Ayacucho, an old colonial town that
was the birthplace of the Shining Path insurgency nine years ago.
   Since 1980, more than 12,000 people have died in Peru's political
violence and the Shining Path has expanded its insurgency throughout
this impoverished country.

   Mayor Eugene Sawyer stepped up the pace of his
campaign Monday, buoyed by late poll results showing him closing in
on Democratic rival Richard M. Daley one day before a court-ordered
primary election.
   ``We're going to get our people to knock on doors all during the
day today and tonight and tomorrow morning,'' Sawyer said during a
campaign stop at a West Side high school, one of at least 10
campaign events during the day.
   Sawyer, the city's second black mayor, was joined by Jesse
Jackson at the school and at a South Side church. He also campaigned
at a public housing project, two senior citizens centers and other
spots.
   At the South Side church Monday night, the finale of Sawyer's
primary campaign, Jackson tried to rally blacks by recalling the
long struggle for the right to vote.
   ``We died too young, bled too profusely and lost too many martyrs
to not vote,'' he said. ``We stand tonight on the tombstone of the
martyrs who paid not with the dollar but their lives for the right
to vote.
   ``Vote for Sawyer with a passion!'' Jackson said.
   Daley was busy, too. The son of legendary Mayor Richard J. Daley
visited restaurants, shook hands with commuters at elevated train
stations and walked through neighborhoods in a frenetic final day of
campaigining.
   ``I'm campaigning very hard,'' Daley assured reporters as he made
one of more than 15 planned campaign stops.
   Tuesday's primaries in the nation's third-largest city are a step
toward filling the vacancy left by former Mayor Harold Washington,
Chicago's first black mayor, who died in November 1987. The Illinois
Supreme Court last year ordered the special election to fill the
last two years of his term.
   Sawyer, who was elected acting mayor by fellow aldermen days
after Washington's death, has been struggling to keep the seat. But
as election day neared, he steadily closed on Daley, the Cook County
state's attorney.
   Poll results released Monday showed Sawyer 7 percentage points
behind.
   Until the last two weeks, the campaign had been relatively free
of the racial rancor that had marked recent mayoral elections. Since
then, Daley has been accused of being a racist and Sawyer's camp
made use of a videotape in which Daley appears to tell a
predominantly white audience that ``you want a white mayor.''
   Daley denied making the statement. His supporters say the
candidate, who is well known for garbling his syntax, slipped and
inserted an extraneous word that sounded like ``what,'' not
``white.''
   The election marks the fifth time in two years that Chicago
voters have been called to the polls, and some residents appear to
be turned off by the campaign.
   ``What they need to do is stop this black and white stuff and get
a qualified person,'' said Sidney Turner, 43, an undecided voter.
   The Chicago election is one of three mayoral elections taking
place around the nation Tuesday.
   In St. Petersburg, Fla., three challengers are trying to unseat
Mayor Robert Ulrich in a nonpartisan primary. And in Wichita, Kan.,
where residents approved a change in the structure of city
government last November, 16 candidates are vying in the first
mayoral election since 1916.
   In Chicago, the Board of Election Commissioners predicted 68
percent of the city's 1,549,367 registered voters would go to the
polls. Temperatures are expected to be in the 20s with a threat of
light snow.
   Although early polls showed Daley far ahead of Sawyer, both
candidates said the latest results confirm what they maintained
throughout the campaign _ Tuesday's vote would be close.
   ``This race is virtually tied up,'' Sawyer campaign spokesman
Larry Horist said.
   Daley and Sawyer are the top contenders in the four-way
Democratic primary Tuesday, while three candidates are running on
the GOP ballot.
   But the wild card in the race is former Alderman Edward Vrdolyak,
who bolted the Democratic Party after a 1987 third-party loss to
Washington. He is running as a write-in candidate on the Republican
ticket, and could give Sawyer an edge by siphoning off white votes
from Daley.
   Because of the difficulty of counting write-in votes, the outcome
of the Republican race might not be known until Thursday, when the
Board of Elections makes its final count.
   The winners of Tuesday's election will run in a general election
April 4 to determine who will finish the final two years of
Washington's second term.
   Washington's former City Council floor leader, Alderman Timothy
Evans, will be running in that election as a third-party candidate,
hoping to stake a claim to Washington's solid black voting bloc.
   The latest poll indicates that the electorate remains divided
along racial lines.
   Sawyer received the support of 73 percent of the black voters
surveyed to Daley's 8 percent. White voters split 79 percent for
Daley, 14 percent for Sawyer. Hispanic voters, who could hold the
key to the election outcome, favored Daley by a 2-1 margin.
   Despite the polarization _ and some eleventh-hour racial
controversy _ the election has been remarkable for its lack of
racial animosity, many observers have said.
   ``I think that this campaign marks a real positive movement for
the city,'' said John McDermott, chairman of The Committee on Decent
Unbiased Campaign Tactics, a watchdog group formed after the
racially divisive 1983 elections that led to Washington taking power.
   ``Despite the ... racial rhetoric in the past week, the number of
incidents of ... appealing to bigotry or bias or using fear of the
other group has declined considerably,'' McDermott said.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry Jr., hoping to reduce the
number of drug-related murders in the nation's capital, on Monday
proposed a mandatory five-year jail term for persons who use guns to
commit crimes.
   ``We are going to launch an all-out assault on weapons in
Washington,'' Barry said at a news conference at a police warehouse
where more than 15,000 weapons confiscated over the last several
years are stored. ``We want to get tough on those who carry guns.''
   Barry's proposal, which will be submitted to the city council
Tuesday, would toughen the city's current midemeanor gun law, which
includes a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $1,000 fine for
those caught with unregistered weapons.
   Barry wants the city to pass the legislation on an emergency
basis, which would enable the council to pass the bill as early as
Tuesday.
   Barry's bill also proposes redefining the city's bail laws so
that those caught carrying an unregistered weapon, selling drugs or
using a weapon in an assault could be denied pre-trial release.
   Barry wants to create a ``drug-free zone'' covering areas 1,000
feet or less from city schools. Under that bill, those caught using
or selling drugs in those areas would face an additional three-year
jail term.
   Barry's gun proposal comes as the city is struggling to slow the
pace of drug-related killings. Police blame about 60 percent of last
year's record 372 killings on drugs.
   Thus far in 1989, 89 people have been killed in the district, 37
more than at the same time last year.
   Weapons seizures are also up. While 2,225 guns were taken by
police on city streets in 1987, 3,863 were taken in 1988.

   A $3 million libel verdict against The
Detroit News has been reinstated by the Michigan Court of Appeals,
which ruled in an opinion released Monday that somebody can be
defamed by implication.
   Even if no specific sentence in a story is false and libelous,
the court said in its 3-0 ruling, a lawsuit can be successfully
brought over the full context of the article, including the
headlines, photographs and page layout.
   ``You can libel someone by innuendo ... in the false impression
that it creates,'' said Jeremiah Kenney, attorney for two men who
sued the Evening News Association, publisher of The Detroit News,
and several reporters.
   Joseph Locricchio and Gary Francell charged that a series of 11
articles in 1978 and 1979 ``falsely portrayed, implied and
insinuated'' they had organized crime ties and were engaged in other
criminal conduct in the development and operation of Pine Knob, an
outdoor entertainment center northwest of Pontiac, the appeals court
said.
   Kenney said in filing the lawsuit that the plaintiffs ``pointed
to the totality of the articles'' which included implications of mob
ties, two unsolved murders, and a series of illegal financial
arrangements.
   A Wayne County Circuit Court jury awarded $3 million to Francell,
but didn't give anything to Locricchio.
   Judge Michael Connor subsequently dismissed the case, saying the
men hadn't proven the articles were false. Connor said that to find
the inferences of the articles libelous was contrary to both
Michigan law and federal law.
   The appeals court, however, said the two men had a case even
though their charges weren't based on a specific false statement in
a particular article.
   The court said it believed that Michigan law has not eliminated
defamation by implication reinstated the jury award.
   Kenney said he didn't think the ruling upholding defamation by
implication represented a new step in libel law. ``In our view, it
has been the law in Michigan for many, many years,'' he said.
   James Stewart, an attorney for the News, said he disagreed with
the ruling.
   ``We believe the decision is regrettable and wrong,'' he said. He
said the ruling means that a person can sue successfully for libel
despite stories being factually correct.
   He said lawyers would consult with newspaper officials on whether
to appeal the case to the state Supreme Court.

   A judge on Monday ordered a 10-year-old
convicted crack dealer taken out of detention and placed in a group
home for troubled children pending the boy's sentencing.
   Suffolk County Family Court Judge Donald Auperin ordered the boy
placed in the custody of the Little Flower Children's Service in
Wading River, on the northern shore of Long Island, until the boy is
sentenced.
   Auperin heard testimony behind closed doors from a psychologist
and a psychiatrist about their evaluation of the child.
   The boy has been in the Nassau Children's Shelter since his Jan.
14 arrest, when undercover police saw him and a 14-year-old
companion selling crack from the back of a bicycle in a rundown
suburban neighborhood.
   Police said the 10-year-old dropped a bag containing three $20
vials of crack, and that the boys also had $226 in cash.
   Auperin found the 10-year-old guilty of juvenile delinquency for
selling and possessing a controlled substance. The 14-year-old's
case was being handled separately.

<TEXT>
   About five acres of burning tires continued
to send smoke billowing into the air Monday, and the operator of the
unlicensed tire dump contended that arsonists were to blame for the
blaze.
   ``Have they caught the arsonist yet?'' asked Richard Evans, owner
of Casings Inc. ``Those tires sat there for a long time and they
don't set fire to themselves, so it has to be arson, right?''
   Evans blamed opponents of the dump for the crisis. ``It was
probably the townspeople who say they don't want it here that
started it.''
   The tire dump has been operating without a license for the last
year since landowner Dominick Valentine's permit application was
turned down. Valentine allows Casing Inc. to operate the dump on his
property.
   No cause has been established for the fire, which began Saturday
and forced the overnight evacuation of 200 families. While schools
were closed Monday, stores near the fire reopened and there were no
evacuations.
   Fire crews used heavy equipment to pull the tires apart in an
effort to halt the fire's spread, and about 40 trucks brought in
loads of dirt and cement dust to smother the flames.
   The tires may be as deep as 30 feet to 130 feet, according to
Harold Tompkins, president of Fire Hose Co. No. 1 in Catskill, and
the fire could burn on for days.
   Tompkins said the federal Environmental Protection Agency had
declared that the level of toxins in the acrid, black smoke was no
danger to human health.
   He said one firefighter suffered heat exhaustion, but no other
injuries were reported. Health alerts were posted for people with
respiratory problems, officials said.
   Catskill is about 40 miles south of Albany.

   Senate Democrats remained unmoved Monday in
their opposition to John Tower's nomination as defense secretary
despite his unprecedented pledge to abstain from alcohol if
confirmed. President Bush returned home declaring that he hasn't
``wavered one iota'' in his support.
   Moments before Air Force One touched down at Andrews Air Force
Base, Bush told reporters that only ``time will tell'' as to whether
Tower will win Senate confirmation.
   ``I don't have any predictions nor do I plan to, except to say I
haven't wavered one iota and I don't intend to,'' Bush said.
   Asked if Tower's pledge would help his cause, Bush shrugged his
shoulders and said, ``I don't know.''
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu met with Republican
senators and Vice President Dan Quayle on Monday night to discuss
the embattled Tower nomination.
   After the meeting, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking Republican on
the Armed Services panel, said there was no discussion about a
withdrawal by Tower. ``The strategy is to go all the way to the mat
and there will be a vote.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who was also in the
meeting, agreed. ``There wasn't any plug mentioned. No pulling of
any plug.''
   During the day, senators trekked to a special committee hearing
room to read the latest FBI report on Tower, while those members the
Bush administration hopes to sway indicated they are either
undecided or leaning against confirmation.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, speaking to reporters on
Air Force One as Bush returned to Washington, said the president
will meet with 12 senators beginning early Tuesday morning.
   Fitzwater declined to identify them but congressional staff said
Sens. George Mitchell, D-Maine; Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; Charles
Robb, D-Va.; Bennett Johnston, D-La.; Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., were among those invited to the White
House.
   Bush also telephoned DeConcini from aboard Air Force One and
urged him to reserve judgment until he had a chance to see all the
evidence, according to the senator's staff.
   ``We're going to work real hard. We're going to talk to a lot of
people and ask them to keep an open mind and to read the FBI report
and to talk to John Tower,'' Fitzwater said.
   Of Tower's pledge not to drink if confirmed, Fitzwater said, ``I
think it should help. It should take care of the drinking
situation.''
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., considered by some a swing vote, told
reporters in Miami that Tower's pledge helps but ``it's not just the
drinking which is a problem to me.''
   ``It's a pattern of bad judgment _ bad judgment in the 1970s in
drinking, bad judgment by placing himself in compromising positions
as the U.S. arms negotiator in Geneva in the mid-80s, bad judgment
in accepting large sums from the defense industry in the late
1980s,'' Graham said.
   The Democratic-controlled Senate Armed Services Committee voted
11-9 along party lines last Thursday to recommend tha the full
Senate reject the nomination, with panel chairman Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., citing Tower's drinking habits among other concerns.
   Tower on Sunday sought to allay the fears of his former
colleagues by issuing an extraordinary pledge not to take a single
drink if he is confirmed. The full Senate is expected to take up the
nomination Wednesday.
   Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, meaning Bush must
pick up at least five Democrats and hold all Republicans to assure
confirmation. Under that scenario, Quayle would break the tie.
   Those Democrats who hinted that they will oppose confirmation
emerged from the special Senate hearing room saying that Tower's
promise and a reading of the FBI report did little to change their
mind.
   ``It's like marrying someone who says, `Trust me, I'll reform,'''
said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. ``You can't do that ... The experience
with people who have problems with drink is that these pledges get
broken much too easily.''
   ``I have not heard of any vote changes as a result'' of Tower's
pledge, said Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., an opponent of the nomination.
He said the pledge could be a ``double-edged sword .... It might be
interpreted that he wants the job too bad.''
   Sen. Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., said the pledge ``will have a
marginal effect.'' And Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said he would vote
against Tower if the vote were today.
   ``If any senator has a serious doubt about the competence of a
candidate, that he should err on the side of safety,'' said Breaux.
``In that case, it indicates voting negatively.''
   The president flew home from his five-day Asia trip Monday and
planned to meet with undecided Democrats in hopes of capturing
enough votes for Tower.
   The administration is also faced with some wavering Republicans.
Over the weekend, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas said she was
undecided and Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota said he would vote
against confirmation.
   Robb, also undecided, said he was keeping ``an open mind.'' But
he called Tower's action an ``astute move on his part. He addressed
at least one of the outstanding questions.''
   Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama, one of several Southern Democrats
still considered open to the White House lobbying effort, said he
has ``to review all the evidence'' was trying to be ``open-minded,
judicial and fair.''
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said he admired Tower for his pledge
and declined to disclose his decision. But he said he doesn't intend
to read the FBI report. Earlier this month, Pryor said Tower has
``become his own worst enemy'' and predicted that he would not be
confirmed.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., told a news conference in
Hartford that he remains undecided and will make a decision after
reading the FBI report.
   Republicans repeated their support for Tower with Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., saying he didn't find ``anything more (in the report)
than I've found so far'' and Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., claiming
that the pledge ``puts to rest any doubts about his capabilities or
any impairment.''
   The White House is preparing a version of the confidential FBI
report for public release in hopes of demonstrating that allegations
against Tower are baseless.

<HEAD>Retired Haitian Colonel's Drug Trial Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drug trial of a retired colonel in the
Haitian army began in federal court Monday with the prosecutor
saying the case was about treachery and betrayal.
   Gary Leon was arrested Nov. 18 when he allegedly accepted a
package containing cocaine from a close friend who is a distant
cousin. The cousin claimed he unwittingly transported the drugs from
Haiti at the request of Leon's wife.
   Leon is charged with conspiracy to traffic in drugs, possession
of cocaine and drug importation.
   His attorney, Calvin David Garber, said in opening arguments in
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn that Leon led ``an exemplary life''
and that until a few months ago had held a high position in the
Haitian military.
   Garber said the Port-au-Prince man's career held no hint of
corruption or drug use.
   Assistant U. S. Attorney Martin Coffey said in his opening
statement that the case was about ``treachery and betrayal.''
   Coffey said the case began Nov. 17 in Haiti when Leon's wife,
Edith, went to the home of the cousin, Marcel Neptune, who was
preparing to leave that day for New York.
   She asked Neptune to take five gift-wrapped packages, which she
said contained perfume and cosmetics, and give them to her husband,
who was in New York, according to Coffey.
   Neptune, a prominent businessman in Port-au-Prince, was arrested
at Kennedy International Airport when Customs agents discovered two
pounds of cocaine inside four of the packages.
   Coffey said Neptune agreed to cooperate with U.S. authorities and
arranged a meeting the next day with Leon at a fast-food restaurant.
   Neptune wore a recording device during the meeting and was under
surveillance by federal agents, the prosecutor said. During their
meeting, Neptune told Leon that the packages contained drugs and
Leon denied knowing anything about it.
   Leon accepted one cocaine-filled package and told Neptune he
would call his wife to clear up the problem, Coffey said. He was
arrested as he left the restaurant.

<HEAD>Iraq To Hold First Presidential Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq will hold its first presidential
election, state-run television reported Monday, without saying when
the ballotting will take place.
   The decision to hold a presidential election was originally made
in 1980, but the war with Iran which broke out in September that
year forced postponement, the report said.
   Under Iraq's Constitution, the president and vice president are
elected by the ruling nine-member Revolutionary Command Council.
   The television said talks were under way to include a provision
for regular presidential elections in a new constitution now being
drafted by a special government committee. The committee is headed
by Izzat Ibrahim, vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council.
   The government said Sunday a referendum will be held to approve
the proposed new constitution and a new parliamentary election law,
allowing new parties to form.
   General elections for the 255-member National Assembly, or
parliament, are scheduled for April 1 after being delayed since
August.
   The television gave no details about the decision to hold the
presidential election.
   But it said President Saddam Hussein's office notified a TV law
program on the issue after a citizen asked, ``Why is the presidency
a monopoly of the Baath Party?''
   No presidential election has taken place in Iraq since the army
overthrew the monarchy in a 1958 coup.
   After further coups, the Baath Socialist Party ousted the
military in a bloodless 1968 putsch with army Brigadier Ahmad Hassan
al-Bakr, a former prime minister, named president.
   Hussein, his vice president after 1969, became president on July
16, 1979, after a peaceful transfer of power.
   The political developments came as Hussein made tentative moves
to liberalize Iraq following the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran
war.
   Iraq has a population of 16 million.

   John Tower, angling for Democratic support in a
bitter confirmation battle, says he will swear off alcohol if he is
approved as defense secretary and would be ``obliged to resign'' if
he broke the vow.
   As Tower made his extraordinary promise Sunday in televised
interviews, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said he might reconvene Armed
Services Committee confirmation hearings to hear testimony in public
about the former senator's drinking habits.
   The committee chairman coupled his statement with a complaint
that the White House was leaking information from the FBI's
background report on Tower in a bid to rescue the nomination.
   Nunn's Democratic-controlled committee voted 11-9 along party
lines last Thursday to recommend that the full Senate reject Tower's
nomination, with the chairman citing allegations of excessive
drinking by the nominee.

   The large drug seizures announced with fanfare
by law enforcement authorities are having little effect on supplies
on the street, with dealers simply absorbing them as a cost of doing
business, federal officials say.
   ``Historically, a manager of drug couriers gives up one courier
who is body carrying (drugs) to take your attention away from four
more,'' said Bill Norsworthy, a Drug Enforcement Administration
agent at the El Paso Intelligence Center.
   ``People walk away from a brand new aircraft after one load and
consider that an expense of the trip,'' he said. ``The same goes for
boats, automobiles, campers. They expect to pay a price.''
   A better way to assess how the United States is doing in the war
on drugs is to ignore the ballyhoo about drug busts and concentrate
on the price and purity level of drugs on the street, says Sen.
Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.

   Nearly a decade after the Three Mile Island
accident, half those polled believe another serious nuclear power
accident is likely, and eight in 10 people favor stricter safety
standards.
   An Associated Press-Media General survey found support for
continued use of nuclear plants now operating. But most opposed
building new plants or starting up completed plants that are not yet
in operation.
   Overall, 55 percent said they supported use of nuclear power to
generate electricity.
   But 56 percent of the 1,162 adults polled said it is impossible
to store radioactive waste from nuclear plants safely. And while
most said the plants are safer now than a decade ago, 50 percent

   Congressional Democrats are split over their
budget strategy, two weeks after President Bush put them on the spot
with a $1.16 trillion spending proposal that leaves many of the
difficult questions unanswered.
   Some leading Democrats lean toward cooperation with the
administration _ perhaps culminating in full-fledged, high-level
negotiations _ as the best way to forge a spending plan and to cut
the deficit to $100 billion, as required under the Gramm-Rudman
balanced budget law.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., and
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, are among those
advocating a cooperative approach.
   ``My sense is that as long as the administration wants to discuss
issues and look at options together, we're prepared to do that,''
Panetta said in an interview.

   The publisher Viking Penguin is considering
labeling unsold copies of Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses''
with an apology in an effort to defuse Moslem protests over the
novel, a newspaper reported today.
   On Sunday, thousands of Shiite Moslems demonstrated in Lebanon
and Iran in support of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order Feb. 14
that Moslems seek out and kill Rushdie and his publishers.
   In London, a senior Viking Penguin editor attending an emergency
meeting of the Writers' Guild of Great Britain said hardback copies
of the novel were selling so well that a paperback edition, due out
in August, might be delayed for ``crude commercial'' reasons.
   But the editor denied reports that Viking Penguin was considering
canceling the paperback edition to appease Moslems who consider the
novel blasphemous.

   After three frustrating years, Swedes
hope the mystery behind the assassination of Prime Minister Olof
Palme is finally solved and that his accused killer will soon be
tried.
   Prosecutors are reported to be worried, however, that their case
may not hold up against the man arrested 10 weeks ago on suspicion
of gunning down Palme on a Stockholm street on Feb. 28, 1986.
   They acknowledge that crucial pieces of evidence are missing. If
they have found a motive, they aren't saying. Legal experts say the
case will rest on whether a chain of circumstantial evidence can be
established.
   ``The prosecution is in bad shape if they don't find the murder
weapon or present other very strong forensic evidence,'' said Lena
Holmqvist, a lecturer in criminal law at Uppsala University.

<TEXT>
   Neo-Nazis are preparing
commemorations on the 100th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth next
month and West German officials are bracing for possible outbreaks
of rightist violence.
   The Nazi dictator was born April 20, 1889, in the Austrian
village of Braunau just over the border from Bavaria.
   ``This is the most important event we've had in a long time,''
said Michael Kuehnen, West German neo-Nazi leader.
   The preparations come as West Germans warily eye a rise in
extreme-rightist sentiments in their country. In January, for
example, the Republican Party made a strong showing in West Berlin's
elections by calling for the expulsion of foreigners and
asylum-seekers.
   Neo-Nazis from several countries are expected at the ``European
Hitler convention'' specifically designed to commemorate the
dictator's 100th birthday, but Kuehnen declined to specify exactly
when or where it will take place.
   ``We don't want to give the country time to gear up to prevent
it,'' he said but added that Spain or Scandinavia were possible
places. Federal law bars such a meeting in West Germany, although
Kuehnen promises smaller birthday commemorations in the Frankfurt
area.
   The neo-Nazi leader, who often wears a brown shirt and black
pants, said the number of participants at the Hitler convention
could range from 1,000 to ``several thousand'' depending on the
location.
   Kuehnen, whose organizing committee even has a logo with the
initials ``AH'' in the center, insisted there will be no ``organized
violence'' on the Hitler anniversary.
   ``But we aren't responsible for every young person and every
soccer rowdy,'' the 33-year-old neo-Nazi added in a telephone
interview. Fringe groups espousing neo-Nazi and rightist beliefs
occasionally disturb professional soccer games in West Germany.
   Kuehnen, who has spent more than seven years in prison for
neo-Nazi activities, has set up an office in Frankfurt to organize
the birthday event with the help of his followers. He's hoping
neo-Nazis and right-wing extremists from Spain, France, Denmark,
Belgium and Norway as well as West Germany will attend the European
convention.
   Although the birthday falls in April, there were reports as early
as January about plans for an observance in the West German news
media.
   The newsmagazine Der Spiegel said on Jan. 30 that this year's
celebrations are meant to attract public attention and distribute
propaganda, in contrast to previous years.
   In the past ``right-wing extremist cronies drank to the Fuehrer
in the back rooms of German bars and in hotels of Hitler's Austrian
birthplace of Braunau,'' Der Spiegel noted.
   Braunau itself was the site of a clash between neo-Nazis and
pro-Communists on Hitler's 90th birthday in 1979.
   This past Jan. 22, the conservative Welt am Sonntag newspaper
said officials already were bracing for acts of violence and that
Jews and foreigners were possible targets.
   Matthias Strohs, a spokesman on internal security issues for the
Baden-Wuerttemberg state Interior Ministry, agrees that trouble
could break out.
   ``There's no question _ you can count on acts of violence,'' he
said. ``The possible targets range from foreigners, to German
officials and allied military installations.''
   Allies France, Britain and the United States drew the neo-Nazis'
wrath for keeping Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy, in prison until he
died in what was officially determined as a suicide in 1987,
although the Soviets were primarily responsible for rejecting pleas
for clemency.
   Strohs, speaking by telephone from his office in Stuttgart, said
vandalism and pro-Nazi slogans painted on walls were also a
possibility around the time of the birthday.
   The spokesman said officials assume older-generation Nazis will
also commemorate Hitler's birthday, but in a much less public way.
   ``The older ones are much more careful in the way they act,''
Strohs said. ``They won't make such a spectacle out in the public.
It will be more of an internal affair.''
   Alfons Metzger, spokesman for the Bavarian Interior Ministry also
said ``violence can't be ruled out'' as a possibility on the Hitler
birthday and that police are alerted to it.
   Several smaller neo-Nazi groups also routinely celebrate Hitler's
birthday, and are expected to do so again this year. Federal
officials say there are about 28,300 right-wing extremists in this
country of 61.3 million people.
   The Deutsche Volksunion (German People's Union), identified by
federal authorities as West Germany's largest right-wing extremist
organization, has totally disassociated itself from the Hitler
commemorations.
   ``We are convinced that on April 20, 1989, there will be several
birthday celebrations for Hitler,'' said Bernd Droese, spokesman for
the party, which claims a membership of 25,000. ``Fifty percent of
them will take place in loony bins, where some people assert they
are the reincarnation of the Fuehrer.
   ``The other 50 percent will be organized by agents and
provocateurs who want to let the specter of the Fuehrer ghost wander
around.''

<HEAD>Paz Estensoro Preparing to Step Down in Now-Stable Bolivia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER McFARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Victor Paz Estenssoro is in the final
months of a presidency that brought a stability rarely seen before
in Bolivia, South America's poorest nation.
   In a country that has had 75 governments in 163 years of
independence, just completing a presidential term is accomplishment,
and few other than Paz Estenssoro have been able to do it.
   Of the 75 governments, only 38 were constitutionally elected; the
rest came about by military coup or some other unconstitutional
manipulation or revolution.
   Paz Estenssoro himself led two revolutions, a leftist one in the
1950s and a conservative one three decades later.
   When he took office after the conservative one, Bolivia was in
the grips of a dizzying 24,000-percent inflation. It took 165,000
Bolivian pesos to buy one dollar's worth of goods and interest rates
were soaring around 800 percent.
   Paz Estenssoro brought the economy back to its feet but to do so,
he had to undo what he had done in his first revolution.
   His third presidential term ends Aug. 6, the 164th anniversary of
independence from Spain. At 81, he plans to retire and turn the
future of Bolivia's 6.7 million people over to the candidate who is
elected in presidential balloting May 17.
   ``Paz Estenssoro wishes to be remembered as the man who was able
to carry out two revolutions,'' said his minister of information,
Herman Antelo.
   Paz Estenssoro first assumed the presidency in 1952, returning
from exile at the end of a union-backed popular revolution that
toppled a military government and shattered the oligarchic control
of a small group of tin mining barons.
   His government was considered one of the most radical of its time
in South America. It nationalized the tin mines, gave peasants the
right to vote and provided them with land by breaking up large
estates.
   He lost in the 1956 elections but returned to office by winning
the vote four years later. He completed that term and was
re-elected, but toppled in a military coup in late 1964.
   Twenty one years later, in 1985, he again became president, this
time on a conservative platform. He said times had changed, and a
new approach was needed to solve Bolivia's problems.
   He dismantled the state mining monopoly he had created,
modernized the economy and successfully challenged the authority of
leftist labor unions that flourished during the 1952 revolution.
   ``The courage and commitment demonstrated by Bolivia under the
presidency of Victor Paz Estenssoro are exemplary and certainly
under-appreciated abroad,'' U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard said in
an interview.
   ``No other democratic government in Latin America has
demonstrated the resolve to undertake a program of fundamental
structural change and then to stick by it.''
   When he began this latest term, the staggering economy had led to
widespread social unrest and virtually all foreign economic
assistance had been cut off.
   His government prescribed harsh remedies. The currency was
devalued by 94 percent, all price supports were lifted, wages frozen
and 17 of the 21 government-run mines were shut down as highly
unprofitable. Of the nation's 26,500 miners, 21,000 lost their jobs.
   While the Bolivian Workers' Central maintains that most of the
fired miners remain unemployed, Information Minister Antelo said
some 18,000 have found other work.
   In all, 35,000 government employees were dismissed.
   The Workers' Central responded to the austerity measures with a
general strike but Paz Estenssoro broke it by declaring a state of
seige and sending labor leaders to internment camps.
   By 1988, inflation had plunged to 21 percent. Labor unrest has
eased, in part because of an emergency public works program launched
with $100 million in aid from the World Bank and European
governments. The country now enjoys a renewed, steady flow of
foreign aid.
   To stop corruption, outside agencies were hired to handle
government purchases and contracts. French and English companies
have been put in charge of imports, certifying their quality and
collecting duties.
   The tax system was overhauled and computerized, and tax revenues
have tripled in three years.
   Ambassador Gelbard said Paz Estenssoro's program ``could serve as
a model for other countries struggling with the burdens of a statist
tradition. Despite the formidable problems that the country still
confronts, the chances of Bolivia generating consistent economic
growth and consolidating its hold on democracy are very good.''
   The reforms have carried a steep social cost, however.
   Malnutrition and illiteracy still plague most of Bolivia's
largely Indian population.
   The minimum monthly wage is the equivalent of $40, while the
prices of most food products are comparable to those in the United
States.
   Unemployment hovers above 20 percent but is declining.
   ``The government's economic policies have led to starvation wages
for the working class,'' charged Simon Reyes, secretary general of
the Workers' Central.
   He claimed the government had capitulated to the demands of the
international banking community, while factories are closing and
workers' earning power is shrinking.

   Naim is a Maronite Catholic and the bank is in Moslem west
Beirut. For him to leave could be dangerous.
   The bank nonetheless is the only government institution that
remains intact in Lebanon's 5-month-old political crisis, which has
split the government, the army and every other department down the
middle.
   This has given the 70-year-old Naim unprecedented powers.
   He said he bankrolls ``the basic needs'' of both governments,
including food and fuel imports, to prevent a complete collapse of
Lebanon's fractured public services.
   In June 1987, when Prime Minister Rashid Karami was assassinated,
Naim moved into the bank headquarters and has never left.
   ``It's more practical to live in the bank,'' he said in an
interview in his plush sixth-floor office. ``The streets aren't
safe.''
   So now he lives in a two-room apartment atop the seven-story
building, which is guarded by 50 policemen.
   ``I cook, wash my dishes, do my laundry and tend my plants
there,'' Naim said.
   His wife travels from the family home in Christian east Beirut
``every two weeks for a weekend with me at the bank,'' Naim said.
   Mrs. Naim, the former Hedda Hofer of Detroit, is a naturalized
American of German descent.
   The political crisis that began in September, when President Amin
Gemayel's six-year term expired with no successor elected because of
sectarian bickering, left Naim the man in the middle.
   Gemayel named his Maronite army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, to
head a caretaker military Cabinet until a new president was elected.
   Moslem and leftist factions refused to recognize Aoun and backed
acting Premier Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem.
   ``The central bank finances the whole of Lebanon according to a
formula of equality and in line with the population and area each of
the governments rules,'' Naim said.
   ``Naim's the only official in this country behaving like a father
to all the Lebanese,'' said Adnan Badra, a Sunni businessman in west
Beirut.
   Although Lebanon's economy is in peril after nearly 14 years of
civil war, the Central Bank has gold reserves estimated at about $5
billion, with $800 million in foreign currency.
   Naim, a lawyer and former university dean brought out of
retirement in 1983 to run the bank, has shown that he will not be
bullied by political pressure from either side.
   Aoun has sought to impose his Christian government's authority on
the bank. In December he closed the only crossing between east and
west Beirut for 10 days after Naim allocated funds to Moslem army
units.
   Naim responded by providing the equivalent of $1 million dollars
to the Moslem side to import flour because Aoun's blockade choked
off supplies from the main warehouses in east Beirut.
   Naim has also had to contend with a serious banking crisis.
   The Al-Mashrek Bank went under in December because of a run by
depositors panicked by reports it was overstretched through hefty
investments.
   The Central Bank, however, underwrote claims by its
non-institutional depositors.
   ``By law, we were not obliged to do what we did,'' Naim
explained. ``It's not our duty ... to aid banks in trouble. But we
intervened, not just to help Al-Mashrek, but to protect the banking
sector and Lebanese society.''
   By Feb. 15, the Central Bank had covered claims for 7 billion
Lebanese pounds ($14 million) and the equivalent to $17 million in
foreign currencies, Naim said.
   ``But for Naim, I'd have lost my life savings when Al-Mashrek
went under,'' said Badra, the Sunni businessman.
   ``I had all my money in Al-Mashrek,'' said Ahmad Rabbou, a Moslem
vegetable merchant. ``When I heard it had collapsed, I felt that 30
years of hard work was lost.
   ``When Naim announced that the Central Bank would guarantee
Al-Mashrek's deposits it was like giving life to a dead man.''

   Richard M. Nixon, volunteer adviser to just
about every president he has known, has some foreign policy counsel
for President Bush: deal warily with Mikhail Gorbachev or risk
``being taken to the cleaners.''
   ``His toughness and intelligence will more than compensate for
his country's economic weakness,'' Nixon says of the Soviet leader,
``and his consummate ability in diplomacy and political maneuver
will guarantee that he seldom winds up with the short end of a
deal.''
   The former president, who made his imprint in foreign policy
before he was driven from office by the Watergate scandal in 1974,
has been offering counsel on his speciality ever since.
   His 1989 installment is in an essay written for the weighty
magazine ``Foreign Affairs.''
   In it, he seconds Bush's slow and cautious approach to Moscow.
   ``President Bush should continue to reject the advice of those
who urge that he schedule a quick summit with Gorbachev in order to
have a foreign policy `victory' early in his term,'' Nixon writes.
``Gorbachev needs a summit far more than the president.
   ``Only when the Bush administration has agreed on a strategy with
our allies and has a definite program for making significant
progress on major issues should President Bush schedule an
American-Soviet summit.''
   Nixon says that having met twice with Nikita Khrushchev, three
times with Leonid Brezhnev and with Gorbachev in 1986, he considers
the current Soviet leader ``in a class of his own.
   ``He is their match in tenacity and forcefulness, but outstrips
them in realism, quickness and intelligence.'' Nixon writes that
``if Western leaders want to avoid being taken to the cleaners, they
must understand what Gorbachev wants and how the West should
respond.''
   Nixon says the new administration should link strategic arms
control negotiations with economic relations, Soviet involvement in
places like Nicaragua and Angola, conventional arms reductions and
other issues that divide the super powers, and take a package
approach in dealing with Moscow.
   ``Without linkage, Gorbachev will string together a series of
easy victories at the bargaining table,'' he says.
   Nixon says that Europe and the Western alliance should be the top
foreign policy priority for the new administration. ``It should call
for a major working summit _ no black ties and no spouses _ to
hammer out a strategy for enhancing our collective security,'' he
writes.
   Europe was Nixon's first overseas stop as president 20 years ago,
although black ties and spouses were included on that journey to
five allied capitals.
   Then, as now, there were strains on the NATO alliance. In Nixon's
time, it was the decision of Charles de Gaulle to pull France out of
the military side of the alliance. The current problem is in West
Germany, and the issue is modernization of short-range nuclear
weapons based there.
   Nixon writes that one of Gorbachev's goals will be ``to separate
the United States from, Europe, particularly Germany ....''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III handled the new
administration's first mission to Europe, covering 16 nations in
eight days. He returned saying that the nuclear modernization
question can be worked out and resolved over the next three months.
   Nixon also sees a new relationship with China as a major item on
the Gorbachev agenda. He said the United States should welcome
closer relations between the two communist giants. ``We can be
confident that, since China's top priority remains economic
development, our relations with Beijing will continue to be closer
than the Kremlin's,'' he says.
   President Bush knows that territory. He served as U.S. envoy to
China for the Nixon administration. He went back as president last
weekend. Gorbachev plans a visit to China in May. Bush told Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping that the summit with Gorbachev would be useful
in bringing stability to the area and the world, and would not
affect U.S. relations with China.
   Nixon calls Europe the central focus of East-West conflict now.
   He says the West needs a new strategy to strengthen NATO and at
the same time foster peaceful change in Eastern Europe.
   ``Harold Macmillan once told me that alliances were held together
by fear, not love,'' Nixon writes. ``For many in Europe and the
United States, the fear of the Soviet Union has waned, and what love
may exist between economic competitors in the West is a very weak
glue to hold an alliance together.''

<HEAD>Inflation's Greased Pig</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of health care is the greased pig of
inflation fighting, forever slipping from the grasp of those who
seek to wrestle it under control.
   No matter what strategy is used the beast eludes it. Penned in,
it leaps the fence. Seemingly winded, it charges tormentors,
scattering them and their ideas and strategies.
   It has left some of the best minds in health care, government,
labor, think tanks and corporations feeling incompetent and
frustrated. New approaches are developed each year. Almost
invariably, they too end up spattered in mud.
   For decades it has been that way.
   From 1967 to 1984, the medical care segment of the consumer price
index quadrupled, despite attempts at control. The Health and Human
Services budget in 1970 was $47.7 billion; this year it will be
eight times that.
   In all, U.S. spending on health care reached $500.3 billion last
year, according to the Conference Board, a New York-based business
research group. That was up 10 percent from the year before, or more
than double the general rate of consumer price inflation.
   The increase continues this year. The sharp, six-tenths of one
percent rise in the January consumer price index included a major
contribution from medical care. That segment led the advances,
rising eight-tenths of a percent.
   The increase is showing up in business costs too. Much of the
recent jump in private employment costs has been caused by the
rising level of expenditures for employee benefits, which
increasingly are health related.
   The big health care bills result not only because of specific
cost increases, such as in doctor's fees, but also because the
number and variety of health care products is expanding. It is a
growth industry, a blue chip.
   Even success does not help matters. Some diseases become more
prominent or vitally important as more people live to ripe old ages.
New technology helps overcome problems, but almost always raises
costs.
   There are surprise factors in the problem. AIDS, for example, was
hardly anticipated. And few medical people foresaw the incredible
spread of substance abuse, the cost of which might account for 3
percent of corporate payrolls.
   That estimate was made by a consulting firm, Mercer Meidinger
Hansen, after surveying corporate chiefs, governors and mayors. And
81 percent felt the problem will worsen if more public resources
aren't devoted to solutions.
   The rampaging cost of health care has been the subject of so many
studies that very little about causes is left unknown.
   Inefficiency of delivery probably is the most commonly mentioned
factor, with critics zeroing in on practices that are considered
wasteful in a business sense. Many of these deficiencies, however,
already have been corrected.
   Third-party payments have been cited as a cost factor, the
assumption being that (1) individuals are more likely to use medical
services if they are paid for by insurance, and (2) hospitals and
others dispensers of medical services might be less inclined to curb
charges when insurers are footing the bill.
   For a time, insurers also were blamed, the accusation against
them being that they readily acquiesced to higher prices, seldom
challenging hospitals or doctors. That has changed, however, in the
past decade or more.
   A raised level of health consciousness, once viewed as a partial
solution, is sometimes cited as a contributant, the rationale being
that to retain good health those most concerned are likely to avail
themselves of medical services.
   But the most basic of all reasons is one unique to health care.
It is the matter of human mortality and the public's inability to
put a price on life _ to answer the question of who should live and
who should be allowed to die.
   Modern technology can extend indefinitely the lives of many
terminally ill people, but at an enormous price. That price puts a
lid on goods and services in all other markets _ on what people will
pay for a car, for example.
   But how do you apply it to life?

<TEXT>
   Carnaby Street, which soared to fame as the fashion
pacesetter for Beatles generation of the Swinging Sixties, is
seeking a new incarnation as a mecca for stylish yuppies of the
1980s.
   When Mary Quant's miniskirts and John Stephen's bell-bottom
hip-huggers clothed the flower children, London became the fashion
capital of the world and Carnaby Street the favorite haunt of the
Mods and Rockers.
   For about a decade, young people from New York to Sydney flocked
to boutiques called Tom Cat, Take 6, and Lord John to buy the latest
in hot pants, platform shoes, wide floral ties and psychedelic
shirts.
   But as styles changed and rents soared in the early 1970s,
Stephen and other designers moved out and Carnaby Street took on a
tacky down-market flavor.
   The street remains a microcosm of English fashion over the last
20 years: Shoppers can buy the '60s Mod look, '70s hippie and ethnic
fashions and '80s punk leather and sado-masochistic gear including
studded leather belts, Sex Pistols T-shirts and neo-fascist and
Nazi-symbol buttons.
   Now the Peachey Property Corp., the private real estate company
that owns about three-quarters of Carnaby Street, wants to restore
some fashion magnetism to the two-block thoroughfare tucked behind
Regent Street in the heart of central London.
   ``We're not trying to revive the '60s,'' said Peter Bourne,
Peachey's surveyor for Carnaby Street. ``What we are aiming to do in
Carnaby Street is cater to the better-off young market, the 15-30
age group who, like the young kids in the '60s, had no shops
catering to them, especially in central London.''
   Over the last two years, Peachey has replaced about half of the
shops that sold this fashion mish-mash with branches of pricier,
fashion chains like Benetton, Supreme, Capricorn, Confetti and Midas.
   The Nazi-insignia merchants have proved such an embarrassment
that the two main stores, on an alley off Carnaby Street, are being
forced out of business under pressure from Peachey, Westminster
borough authorities and anti-fascist campaigners.
   Mary Quant, who worked out of the King's Road in Chelsea in the
1960s, has opened her first shop on Carnaby Street, selling makeup
and accessories. She said she was lured by the revival of the
surrounding Soho area as a center for young people and young
industries.
   Bourne hopes the whole street eventually will be yuppified with
wine bars, restaurants and art galleries.
   ``It does take a long time to move a whole area around,'' he said
in an interview. ``Not only do we have to change tenents, but we
have to tell the world this area has changed.''
   Last June, Peachey relaunched Carnaby Street with balloons,
20,000 leaflets and the message that it was now ``synonymous with
chic and stylish London.'' This year, it hopes to start regular
street theater and entertainment and stage fashion and art shows.
   Knitwear designer Marion Foale, who moved into Carnaby Street in
the early 1960s and did clothes for the Beatles, remembers when it
was a quaint backwater where you could get a saddle mended.
   ``Now, it's beginning to come up again,'' she said. ``But it's
always different. ... The next Carnaby Street will have its own
incarnation.''
   But many shoppers, designers and storekeepers mourn the Carnaby
Street they say is gone forever.
   ``It's an interesting historic relic. It's where it all
started,'' said Los Angeles-born Giffi Fields, who started selling
hand-painted, made-to-measure men's clothes to Carnaby Street shops
in the late 1960s.
   ``Carnaby Street was a one-off (one-of-a-kind area) at its time
because it was a street devoted to youth culture,'' he said. ``Every
major city in the world today doesn't have only one street, but many
streets devoted to youth culture. So you just don't get the
uniqueness anymore and you won't get the uniqueness.''
   At Inderwick's pipe shop, a Carnaby Street landmark for at least
70 years and the only store left from the 1960s, owner Peter
Anderson doubted Peachey would succeed because the street is getting
the same stores as dozens of other shopping areas in London.
   ``Most shops are multiple or franchises. Not one shop has
individual character except The Great Frog, because they make their
own jewelry,'' said the 64-year-old businessman.
   ``I can't see it ever becoming what they're aiming for. It's
still a street without any character.''
   Shopkeepers at both ends of the market are unhappy with Carnaby
Street's current clientele.
   Those at the top said the street was still attracting the same
customers it did in 1975 _ young people looking for cheap clothes.
But those at the bottom complained that the punks, Mods, skinheads
and hippies had gone and the street was attracting too many straight
people in suits.
   Potential shoppers wandering along the street recently were also
unimpressed.
   ``It's just like a pedestrian walkway with tacky shops on either
side,'' complained Allen Sawkins, 30, a student and motorcycle
courier. ``It's just a tourist trap. Most people from London
wouldn't come here.''
   Alan Tate, 20, a student from Manchester, said: ``It's gone
downhill. It's too respectable now. The businessmen have taken over.
It tries to be anarchic and anti-establishment, but it does it all
commercially so it's not unique.''

<HEAD>Second-Hand Shops Flourish as Norway's Economic Slumps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A slumping economy is sending Norwegians on
bargain hunts in junk shops and second-hand stores.
   When North Sea oil wealth flowed, Norwegians spent freely in an
economy that quickly became overheated, but the boom came to an
abrupt end two years ago when oil prices plunged.
   ``Business is booming,'' said Leon Andersen, who runs a Salvation
Army shop in the city of Stavanger. ``It's better than ever. So far
this year sales are up 30 percent compared to last year.
   ``People come here looking for everything from used clothes to
furniture. They're being more careful with their money.
   ``We just may run out of used merchandise. People seem to be
holding onto their things. They make do with an old couch for
another year or use an old dress another season.''
   Stavanger, the nation's oil capital on the west coast, was
hardest hit by the collapse of oil prices in 1986, but the drop in
national income has squeezed the whole country.
   With its offshore oil fields pumping 1.44 million barrels a day,
lower crude prices quickly chilled Norway's overheated economy.
   Tough measures, including legislated wage controls, have helped
reduce inflation and the trade deficit. But unemployment doubled in
the last year to 4 percent, the highest since the 1930s, and
thousands of businesses went broke.
   The government decisions, combined with a modest recovery of oil
prices, hold out promise for the future, but it may take time before
it is felt in the household budget.
   ``Many Norwegians may be willing to lower their standards a
little compared to 1986,'' said Oddbjoern Eiden, an economist for
the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry.
   He said consumer spending declined 1.6 percent in 1988 after
dropping 2.7 percent in 1987. In 1986, the peak of the oil boom and
spending spiral, consumption leaped 5.7 percent.
   ``It's hard to say why people would buy more used merchandise,''
said Oddbjoern Knutsen of the state Institude of Social Research. He
said it was possible that Norwegians were simply returning to a
normal state of affairs.
   ``I don't think the spending spree of mid-1980s was typical. Oil
resulted in an economic growth that was without equal in the West.
And people spent money freely,'' he said.
   ``It's more typical of Norwegians to be careful with money. If
they are indeed buying more used things and not discarding as much,
then it seems we are returning to the cautious ways of the 1950s and
1960s, when Norway was not a rich nation.''
   Arne Johansen, who works for Oslo's five-store Elevator thrift
shops, said he noticed an upswing in sales just after the economic
slump began.
   ``We haven't noticed much of an increase since 1987 at any of our
stores individually. Sales are pretty stable. But a lot more used
merchandise shops have opened in Oslo during the past year or two,''
he said.
   ``Business is up,'' said Willy Olsen, who has owned Oslo's
Willy's Used Merchandise for 22 years. ``But a lot of new stores
have opened. There must be 10 that opened in the past two years.''
   Twenty-nine thrift shops are listed in the telephone book for
Oslo, a city of 425,000.

   Alphabetically speaking, Yuba City, Calif., was
used to being last on lists. But catching the caboose in Rand
McNally's ``Places Rated Almanac'' four years ago insulted residents
right down to their toes.
   At first, they fumed, they raged, they stamped their collective
civic feet. Then they got smart.
   City leaders decided ``there are only two places to be on the
list: the top _ and the bottom,'' said Mary Knapp, Yuba-Sutter
Chamber of Commerce executive vice president. ``It depends what you
make of both of them.''
   What Yuba Citians made from last place was a heap of first-rate
public relations hay.
   In the 50 years since one E.L. Thorndike created his ``goodness
index'' for American cities, academicians, special interest groups,
magazines and the federal government have cranked out a plethora of
rankings identifying the best of all possible towns.
   Stressed out? Live in State College, Pa., says one survey; Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, says another.
   Best place for a hip, contemporary career woman? Seattle, Savvy
magazine says.
   Easiest place to make friends? San Francisco, Forbes magazine
says.
   No. 1 overall? It's Pittsburgh, says one survey; Danbury, Conn.,
says another.
   In a nation where everybody loves the underdog but nobody wants
to be one, where everyone says it doesn't matter what other people
think but no one believes it, city ratings have become a source of
indignation, elation, frustration and, always, fascination.
   Now, it's almost time for another edition of ``Places Rated,''
the most objective and carefully researched of the bunch. Like the
presidential election, it appears every four years _ and a lot of
people don't like the results.
   The fallout has included threatened lawsuits, map and magazine
burnings and, on a number of occasions, campaigns for civic
improvements.
   But ask researchers, city officials and municipal groups what
city rankings mean, and how seriously to take them, and the answers
seem to be not much, and not very.
   ``There's no best city, just like there's no best work of art,''
said Bert Sperling, a Portland, Ore., computer researcher who,
despite that opinion, created software that rates cities. ``Who's to
say Van Gogh's `Sunflower' is better than (da Vinci's) `The Last
Supper'?''
   And who's to say there are 328 better places to live than Yuba
City? Why, ``Places Rated'' authors David Savageau and Richard
Boyer, that's who.
   When Yuba City leaders reflected on how to make the best out of
being the worst, they decided to lighten up.
   ``If you screamed and ranted and raved, you made a fool of
yourself,'' Knapp said. ``We decided to make a fun thing of it.''
   First, 1,000 residents burned hundreds of Rand McNally maps at a
community pep rally, packaged the ashes in a walnut box and had a
local mortician present them to a Rand McNally vice president, who
flew out from Chicago just for the occasion.
   Then the city helped a radio station in Pittsburgh _ rated No. 1
in the same survey _ award an all-expense paid trip to Yuba City as
a contest prize. The happy winners toured the city by limousine and
rode a float in the 105th Annual Bok-Kai Festival. A good time was
had by all.
   And at year's end, when Life magazine wrapped up 1985, it was
Yuba City, not Pittsburgh, that received a full page. ``And they
spelled the name right,'' Knapp mused, a little amazed.
   It took ``Places Rated'' to not only rocket Yuba City out of
obscurity but to propel the metro ratings game onto the best-seller
list.
   The idea sprang from the authors' desire to move out of Boston
and their discovery that there was no single source for good, solid
data on life in U.S. cities. They decided to compile a comprehensive
American cities reference guide, and sold Rand McNally on the idea
in 1978.
   The first edition, with Atlanta at the top and Lawrence, Mass.,
in the cellar, came out in 1981.
   More than 300,000 book sales later, Savageau says he's a bit
disappointed that the book is considered more the topic of cocktail
party chitchat than the serious reference tool the authors intended,
and he acknowledges its popularity still baffles him.
   ``I wouldn't go out and buy a book that said Pittsburgh was the
best place in the country,'' he said, taking a rare break from his
computer and the latest edition of ``Places Rated,'' due out this
fall from Simon &amp; Schuster Inc., which acquired the series last year
from Rand McNally.
   When the statistics laid the exalted mantel of extreme livability
on Pittsburgh, a city once known as ``hell with the lid off,'' even
Rand McNally didn't believe it at first.
   The crowning of Pittsburgh illustrates the key difference between
``Places Rated'' and other city rankings.
   The Savageau-Boyer study gives equal weight to climate, housing,
crime, transportation, health care, recreation, education, the arts
and economics. That might tend to give an edge to larger cities,
which have more amenities, and doesn't take into account which
factors people think are most important.
   Other studies tend to focus on one aspect of life, such relief
from stress _ which the advocacy group Zero Population Growth found
in Cedar Rapids and a study in Psychology Today magazine found in
State College.
   Or they consider the preferences of a specific group of people,
as Money magazine does, polling 251 subscribers. In its 1987 survey,
Pittsburgh was 43rd; Nashua, N.H., was No. 1. Last year, Pittsburgh
moved to No. 20; Danbury, Conn., was top of the heap.
   A change from one year to the next in what the subscribers
consider most important _ say, education over leisure, or
transportation over weather _ plus even a small shift in a city's
vital statistics can account for a wild fluctuation, said Sperling,
whose company, Fast Forward, has created a computer program called
``Places U.S.A.'' used by Money.
   ``Some of the cities that have been disappointingly rated have
used it to say, `Oh, yeah?,' and show they have a strong community
support base,'' said Randy Arndt, spokesman for the National League
of Cities. ``It depends on the resourcefulness of the city.''
   The league wouldn't dream of ranking its 1,400 members. ``I don't
know who these surveys benefit, except the authors. Everybody
doesn't live in the perfect place, but it's home to us,'' Arndt
said. ``Whether you live in Scarsdale or Saginaw, life is what you
make of it.''
   The same can be said of city ratings.
   In the next ``Places Rated,'' Savageau and Boyer plan a section
designed to make everyone happy by showing how under certain
conditions, using factors in the book, any burg can be a Pittsburgh.
   ``For instance, if the only thing you're interested in are cities
in California with a moderate climate and low cost of living,''
Savageau said, ``Yuba City would be the best place in the whole
country.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Most Jews leaving the Soviet Union today are
heading somewhere other than Israel. That's partly because the dream
has gone sour for many of the so-called ``refuseniks'' who reached
the Promised Land after years of persecution only to find that in
Israel the issues are not always black and white. Further, Soviet
Jews don't always feel welcome in the Jewish state.

   After years of struggle to get out of the Soviet
Union, often at the pain of prison or Siberian exile, many former
``refuseniks'' have become disillusioned at what they found when
they reached their Promised Land.
   Israel, they have discovered, is beset by a chaotic political
system and deep social divisions between religious and secular Jews.
Even more disturbing to some is the harsh repression of the
Palestinian uprising that has been going on for more than a year
now. More than 385 Palestinians have died.

of Soviet Jewry, has found his loyalties torn between his Jewish
patriotism and his concern for human rights.
   Two of his former colleagues in the fight inside the Soviet Union
_ Ida Nudel and Yosef Begun _ have been stunned more by the cool
reception that many Soviet immigrants receive in Israel.
   ``The situation of the immigrants here is so bad. After devoting
20 years of my life to this issue, it is very painful for me to face
what is happening,'' said Nudel, known as the ``Guardian Angel'' for
risking her own life to help other Jews in prison.
   These and other activists say that stories about such
difficulties filtering back home are a major reason why most Jews
leaving the Soviet Union today, under the glasnost policies of
Mikhail Gorbachev, are chosing to live someplace besides Israel.
   In 1988, Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union hit an
eight-year high of 20,082. But only 7 percent came to Israel _ a
record ``dropout'' rate since the emigration struggle began two
decades ago. In those years, about 255,000 Soviet Jews have settled
in Israel.
   Nudel, whose cause was championed by U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz and stars like Jane Fonda, typifies the loneliness and
isolation experienced by many immigrants.
   She arrived in October 1987 after being a ``refusenik'' _ the
term for those refused an exit visa _ for 16 years. She still
suffers backaches from eight years in exile in Siberia and in
Bendery, south of Moscow, as punishment for her anti-Soviet activism.
   Nudel, 57, is a graying and bespectacled woman who stands
4-foot-10. She is single in a family-oriented society. She recently
gave away her pet dog, Pizer, brought all the way from Siberia,
after it proved too much for her tiny, three-room apartment. Her
poor understanding of Hebrew makes even watching television a chore.
   She spends most of her time at the apartment of her sister, Elana
Fridman, occasionally venturing out to try to help fellow immigrants
through the maze of Israeli bureaucracy to find jobs and housing.
   She says she was torn between conflicting impulses _ the need to
rebuild her own life and the desire to once again lead a fight for
Jews from her native land.
   ``To be a symbol for a lifetime is too much for any human
being,'' Nudel says. ``Physically, I also don't feel very strong,
but I feel I cannot rest.''
   Mrs. Fridman, who spearheaded the campaign for her sister's
release, is frustrated that Nudel is no longer treated as a heroine.
   ``Everyone understands that people like her made history, that
these are people who suffered as Jews, but I think that there is not
enough admiration shown,'' Mrs. Fridman says. ``This hurts.''
   During an interview in her sister's apartment, Nudel sits
uneasily on the sofa, occasionally massaging the side of her weak
back. She turns the conversation away from herself to focus on the
plight of immigrants in general.
   ``I think there is a crisis in the ideology Israel was built
upon,'' she says. ``Today every newcomer is considered a nuisance.
We should be considering them a blessing.''
   The well-known refuseniks, who receive government stipends or can
make a living writing about their experiences, do not share the
poverty of most Soviet immigrants.
   For them, the main problem is dealing with the gap between what
was a dream and what is the harsh reality of Israel, says Yuri
Stern, a spokesman for the Soviet Jewry Education and Information
Center.
   ``It takes such tremendous effort and concentration to overcome
the fears in the Soviet Union, that to survive you need to picture
Israel in an idyllic way,'' Stern says. ``Then you come here, you
see that it is a real country, reality, not a dream.''
   What the refuseniks and other Soviet immigrants find is that
Israelis, most of whom are Middle Eastern and not European, have
little concern for the plight of the new immigrants.
   Many native-born Israelis recall their parents' hard times in a
new country 40 years ago and speak resentfully of the small
government aid given to newcomers.
   ``Israelis say they don't understand why the Russians shout. They
say, `When we came here back in the 1950s, we lived in tents.' But
this is a different time, nobody lives in tents anymore,'' says
Yosef Begun, 56, the former refusenik who waged a 17-year battle to
emigrate.
   Begun spent about a decade in and out of jail, discarding his
profession as a mathematician to help revive the study of Hebrew
language and culture in Moscow. He arrived in Israel about a year
ago.
   Unlike Nudel, Begun has found his niche in Jerusalem's religious
community and basks in his newfound freedom.
   ``After the snows of Moscow where people wore gloomy faces
because there was never enough food, here we are in a blossoming,
colorful country,'' the bearded Begun says, seated by a window
overlooking Jerusalem's old walled city.

   He works for the Jewish Agency in a program to revive Soviet
Jewish culture. Moscow's new liberalized policies toward minorities
are allowing him to do from Jerusalem what he couldn't do 10 years
ago in Moscow.
   But Begun believes that Israel is not doing enough to revive
Judaism in the Soviet Union and is critical that the issue has
little public sympathy in Israel.
   ``I fear that what Gorbachev is doing now will only amount to
window dressing if we don't take action to help more Jews learn
about their past,'' he says. ``Most Soviet Jews only know they are
Jewish because it is written in their passports.''
   The 41-year-old Sharansky has found his new life in Israel to be
a study in contrasts between personal bliss and disillusionment with
Israeli society.
   Sharansky, a former member of Andrei Sakharov's Human Rights
Watch Committee, heads a new lobby group that tries to help Soviet
immigrants settle in Israel. He is the father of two daughters,
2-year-old Rachel and Hannah, born last November.
   He immigrated in February 1986 after a dramatic spy swap on
Berlin's Glienicke Bridge. He had spent nine years in prison on
charges of anti-Soviet espionage. His sentence was reduced from 13
years after a tireless campaign by his wife, Avital, who traveleds back
in his
office swivel chair and says:
   ``It's a strange feeling _ a happy end without an end. In the
movies there's a two-minute ending and it's over. This one just goes
on and on.
   ``I still cannot even get used to saying the phrases, `The
children are sleeping. The children are playing.' The very word
children sounds so unusual. We keep thinking maybe it's not us. We
waited so many years for this.''
   Sharansky has disappointed those who thought his wit and fluent
Hebrew would turn him quickly into an Israeli politician. He has
turned down pleas to join the two major parties.
   In January, Sharansky's name surfaced briefly as a possible
candidate for Israel's ambassador to the United Nations.
   His supporters contended his international stature as a human
rights campaigner would help improve Israel's image at a time when
it was being criticized for mistreating Palestinians.
   However, opponents appeared to win out, arguing that his
appointment would sour a thaw with Moscow and that he was
politically too inexperienced.
   Sharansky has written a book about his life and, along with
working for Soviet Jewry, speaks out for more tolerance between
religious and secular Jews _a problem that dogs his personal life
with Avital.
   Mrs. Sharansky is religious and he is not, making them an odd
couple in a country where secular and religious Jews usually live in
separate neighborhoods.
   Sharansky thinks religion should be a private matter, and lashes
out at newspaper gossip speculating his marriage could fall apart
because of religious differences.
   ``I feel like my own bald pate has been conscripted into Israel's
kulturkampf,'' or culture war, Sharansky says. ``People here
concentrate too much on their differences. You have to concentrate
instead on principles and common aims.
   ``Mine and Avital's ways about religion are very different. I am
not religious but there are some things I accept that help us build
a family. What I do basically is to observe the Jewish teaching of
maintaining domestic tranquility.''
   Sharansky is also critical of the acrimony and horse-trading
among the 15 political parties in Israel's 120-member Parliament.
   ``I'd like to see more mutual values and consensus in Israel,''
he says. ``It also upsets me to see people sacrificing principles.
The most disappointing thing is the intolerance in society. With
that we will have to deal.''
   Sharansky says that one of his problems in coping with what is
going on in Isreal is getting used to having so many choices and
shades of differences after fighting for so many years against the
one-party system in the Soviet Union.
   ``After you fight a world which is black and white and you know
exactly what you want and you don't compromise with evil, you come
to the free world where the choices are tremendous and the colors
are very numerous,'' he says.
   One of the multicolored issues Sharansky has trouble dealing with
is the Palestinian problem. His views are a vague fusion of a
conservative loyalty to his new country and an overall concern for
human rights.
   During the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, Sharansky has researched Israel's controversial jailing
practices, which allow imprisonment without trial, and complicated
regulations governing when soldiers may shoot at protesters.
   He speaks defensively about what he has learned.
   ``I spoke to leading army people about instructions to soldiers,
about opening fire,'' he says. ``You cannot imagine how many cases
there are where this is forbidden. The poor soldiers can't even keep
track of all the rules.
   ``Because of the nature of this country, there are serious human
rights problems, like in every country. But a democracy has
instruments to deal with these problems. We have developed a system
of self-checks.''
   Before the uprising, Sharansky also met with Palestinian leaders
in the occupied territories, such as Faisal Husseini of East
Jerusalem. But he curtailed most of these contacts after sharp
public accusations that he was consorting with the PLO.
   Sharansky has resisted pressures from Arab groups seeking his
support by trying to draw a comparision between their struggle for a
Palestinian state and the fight for Jewish emigration from the
Soviet Union.
   ``To say that because Sharansky was against the Soviet Union this
should make him against the Israeli government, this isn't true,''
Sharansky says. ``There is no parallel between them. They are two
principally different things.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Nobel laureate William Butler Yeats died in the
South of France in l939, but World War II delayed the return of his
remains to Ireland for almost a decade. Now on the 50th anniversary
of his death, a great mystery hovers over his grave in Ireland. Did
the French undertakers dig up the wrong body or just send any old
body? If so, where is the Irish bard? And what does that epitaph on
his tombstone mean?

   Fifty years after his death, tourists
by the busload and in a procession of rental cars pay scant heed to
the epitaph William Butler Yeats had carved on his tombstone in the
little churchyard here:
   ``Cast a cold eye
   ``On life, on death.
   ``Horseman, pass by!''
   Last year, 50,000 visitors from as far away as Japan and
Australia trooped into the Church of Ireland graveyard ``under bare
Ben Bulben's head,'' the flattopped mountain that like a huge grand
piano with the lid down echoes the winds and waves of the wild
Atlantic. Some carried well-thumbed volumes by the Nobel laureate
regarded by many as the sublimest poet of the English language since
Milton.
   ``Even on the foulest, wettest day, if I leave the church open,
someone is sure to come by and sign the guest book,'' says the Rev.
Robert Hayman, an American from San Francisco by way of Seattle who
is rector of St. Columba's, the rural Protestant parish where Yeats'
great-grandfather had served.
   Record numbers are expected for this year's semicentennial
observance of the poet's death. In August, scholars and lecturers
from around the world will gather for the 30th session of the Yeats
International Summer School.
   For something to write postcards home about besides ``the most
wild and beautiful scenery under a sky ever loaded and fantastic
with flying clouds,'' as Yeats described it, there is renewed
controversy over whether the poet actually lies beneath the epitaph
he composed four months before his death in 1939. For certain, his
wife is buried there, memorialized by a smaller stone engraved
``George,'' which also mystifies visitors.
   ``Like a plague of locusts, that question of the wrong body in
the grave comes up every seven years,'' scoffed Aengus Cantwell,
president-elect of the Council of the Yeats Society, which
administers his library and memorial in the old Royal Bank building
in Sligo. ``Willie probably would have enjoyed this morbid joke on
himself, but it's very distasteful for his son, Michael, and
daughter, Anne, to have to go through it all over again.''
   Yeats in declining health sought the warmth of the French
Riviera, where he died on Jan. 28, 1939. The outbreak of World War
II delayed compliance with his wish to be buried at Drumcliff, so
his casket was taken to the little cemetery at Roquebrune on the
heights overlooking Menton and Monaco in the shadow of the Alps.
   Rumors of what happened there resurfaced last fall when British
biographer Diana Souhami was researching the life of Dutch painter
Hannah Gluck, a close friend of Yeats. She reported finding
``letters from the priest in Roquebrune and the undertakers''
casting doubt on who was buried where. Her version has Georgie
Yeats, the poet's widow, consigning his remains to a temporary
grave, which she thought would remain untouched for at least 10
years. Instead, claimed the writer, he was buried in a paupers'
grave ``with four or five others,'' which was cleared in 1946 and
``all the bones placed in a common ossuary.''
   Biographer Souhami said artist Gluck and journalist Edith Heald
visited Roquebrune a year later and ``were shocked to find no trace
of Yeats' grave.'' Gluck had friends write to the priest, who
replied that it would be possible to identify the poet's remains
``if we empty the entire contents of the ossuary and if we have
details of distinctive characteristics which will enable us to
reconstruct the skeleton after painstaking research carried out
under the direction of a medical expert.''
   But, according to Souhami, ``Yeats' purported remains were
exhumed and shipped to Ireland just one month later _ much too soon
to enable the bones to be indentified'' with scientific precision.
   In a letter to the Irish Times, Michael Yeats, a member of the
Irish Senate like his father, denounced her claims as ``the greatest
nonsense.'' He insisted his mother had overlooked the whole
operation and the remains were measured. ``It is absolutely certain
that my father is buried in County Sligo,'' he wrote. ``I have the
documentation to prove it.''
   All of which keeps alive a bizarre and macabre tale of the sort
William Butler Yeats would have relished hearing from the farmers
and fishermen around Sligo Bay and retelling in glorious, ghoulish
detail in his folk collection titled ``Mythologies.'' Even the
reburial of Yeats at a grand state funeral is an enduring chapter in
the oral history of Ireland's wild west.
   The American critic Hugh Kenner found this out when he
interviewed the locals more than three decades after that September
morning in 1948 when the Irish gunboat Macha brought the remains to
Galway harbor ``whence they bumped to Sligo, past knots of
schoolchildren standing mute with their teachers, along roads never
built for a poet's gliding.''
   He was told ``for a fact'' how ``the coffin was a substitute
filled with stones, how drunken sailors let the original slide into
the unplumbed Mediterranean; also how the Macha ran aground in Sligo
harbor before being diverted to Galway, and how her load, whether
stones or lead-encased bones, instantly broke the hearse's springs.''
   It's almost a tale told by ``Silly Willie himself,'' as Cantwell
said Sligo people still characterize the poet from his habit of
walking solitary and often barefoot along the strand at Rosses
Point, through the woods of Lissadell, on the lake isle of
Innisfree, up tortuous trails to the barren heights of Ben Bulben
and Knocknarea and the other childhood haunts that echo in his
lovely lines.
   Yeats was born in Dublin, lived much of his life in London and
died in France. Yet he always regarded Sligo, where he spent every
boyhoood summer, as his home. His barrister father gave up law to
become a painter. His brother, Jack, was Ireland's leading artist.
   His mother's side of the family, the seafaring Middletons and
Pollexfens, were steamboat captains, smugglers and eventually
prosperous ship owner's on whom a poor poet could always depend for
a free passage home from Liverpool.

   Young Willie spent many summers with Uncle Henry Middleton at
Elsinore House, which had a secret tunnel for the delivery of
contraband from the beach and the ghost of that smuggling ancestor
strolling the veranda or tapping at the window pane.
   Nearby lived bachelor uncle George Pollexfen, a spirit-raising
medium who imbued Yeats with a lifelong infatuation with horoscopes,
seances, crystal balls, tarot cards, telepathy and remembering
bizarre dreams like the apparition of ``Bernard Shaw as a smiling
sewing machine.''
   Young Yeats sat with old people by their turf fires to hear myths
and legends he later retold in ``The Celtic Twilight'': tales about
Queen Maeve buried in the massive cairn near the top of Knocknarea,
the warrior Cuchulain who fought the horses of the sea in Sligo Bay,
and the O'Cuirnin family of Gaelic bards with whom he felt a mythic
kinship when rowing out to their island in Lough Gill.
   Yeats set for himself the poetic goal of bringing together
Ireland's heroic legends and rural folklore after listening to tales
told by the likes of ``one Paddy Flynn, a little bright-eyed old man
who lived in a leaky one-room cabin'' on the Sligo road and often
was found ``under a hedge smiling in his sleep'' after dancing the
night away with troops of leprechauns.
   The ghost-mad lad known hereabouts as ``old parson Yeats
great-grandson'' went off to Stockholm in 1923 to receive the Nobel
Prize for literature from the King of Sweden.
   Going down the eight fairway at Rosses Point, the cultured golfer
can see the gray stone walls of Lissadell, the Georgian country
house of Sir Henry Gore-ooth, also haunted and now open to tourists.
Here Yeats wrote a tragic poem to the two daughters that begins:
   ``The lights of evening, Lissadell,
   ``Great windows open to the south,
   ``Two girls in silk kimonos, both
   ``Beautiful, one a gazelle.''
   Constance, the older of two, not the gazelle, whose name was Eve,
was an impassioned Irish revolutionary who was sentenced to a firing
squad for commanding the forces that held St. Stephen's Green during
the Easter Rising of 1916. Her sentence was commuted to life in
prison, and Yeats wrote several poems to her before her eventual
release.
   Britain hurriedly executed 16 leaders of the rising, including
the severly wounded James Connolly, who was carried in a wheel chair
out to the firing squad, and Yeats helped canonize them as martyrs
in a magnificent canto.
   Farther south along the coast in neighboring County Galway is
Coole Park, where for two decades Yeats was the frequent house guest
of the playwright Lady Augusta Gregory.
   The great house in Dublin where they launched the Irish National
Theater, which soon became the Abbey Theater, has been torn down,
but in the walled garden amid the ruins is a huge copper bench
carved with the initials of Yeats, Shaw, Sean O'Casey, John
Masefield, the painter Augustus John and the abbey's resident
genius, John Millington Synge.
   A few miles away is Thoor Ballylee, the 14th century Norman tower
that Yeats renovated as a summer cottage for Georgie Hyde-Lees, the
22-year-old bride he took after years of pining away in impassioned
poetry for actress Maud Gonne.
   George, as she was called in life as well as on her tiny
tombstone, was also a psychic medium who introduced Yeats to
``automatic writing.''
   The tower, which figured in the title of two collections of
Yeats' verse, is now a Yeats museum. Tourists can climb the winding
stairs to the secret room on the top floor where the couple sought
contact with the beyond.
   George continues to intrigue the pilgrims who ignore Yeats'
injunction to pass by the grave.
   ``It's the name of his dog,'' pastor Hayman has heard many a
visitor comment.
   ``Actually,'' said Cantwell, ``Yeats had a dog named Daniel
O'Connell.''
   The poet was never comfortable with the laboring class that
worshiped The Liberator but a generation later deserted Charles
Parnell. Although a shrewd businessman himself, who cast a warm eye
on the abbey's box office, Yeats also professed haughty disdain for
the merchants who ``fumble in a greasy till.''
   The poet, said Cantwell, ``regarded the peasants as the font of
Irish poetic lore and greatly admired the occupants of the stately
houses, but he didn't care much for those in between.''
   A sense of ``romance and adventure'' propelled the Rev. Hayman
from St. Luke's in downtown San Francisco to St. Columba's in rural
Sligo. Several summers before, while based in Seattle, he had
swapped pulpits with a Limerick clergyman and ``fell in love with
Ireland. When Drumcliff became available last March, my wife Sally
and I were ready.''
   Going though the parish archives he discovered that the Rev. John
Yeats, the poet's ancestor, ``had run up a bill of some 400 pounds
with the wine merchant in Sligo, which was a goodly amount in 1846.''
   So far pastor Hayman has had neither the occasion nor the
collection receipts to match that standard of hospitality. His noon
service on Sunday draws a congregation of 55, ``mostly farming
people.''
   But with the advent of summer and the return of the chartered
buses, the parish operates a little tea shop in a shed near the
rectory and provides toilet facilities.
   ``It's really amazing,'' Hayman says. They come from all over.
France. Holland. Germany. Many from Japan and Korea. If you noticed,
we just had new doors put on the church. Those lovely brass handles
were the gift of the Yeats Society of Western Australia.''
   The pilgrims arrive full of awe and sometimes wonder. ``This past
summer,'' Hayman recalls, ``a busload arrived led by a Roman
Catholic priest who was totally dumbfounded to find that Yeats was
buried in a Protestant churchyard.''
   The American pastor at Drumcliff is called upon time and again to
explain that enigmatic epitaph. ``I always have to admit I don't
know what it means. Some scholars say the poet may be addressing his
own ghost. All I know is you could write a Ph.D. thesis on those few
words.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They are the ``club kids,'' college-age offspring
of the baby boomers, partying the night away at Manhattan's
sex-charged dance clubs. They dress outrageously to attract
attention, to catch the eye of the person watching the door, to get
waved to the head of the line. When that happens, they have arrived
in more ways than one.

   There are men who dress like women and women who
dress like Madonna, college students whose nocturnal revelry
precludes classes before 2 p.m. Theirs is a kinky world of
acid-house music, designer drugs and sexual antics in the safe-sex
era.
   Manhattan dance clubs are a way of life for ``club kids'' in
their late teens and early 20s, many of them from suburbs and small
towns where an affinity for late hours and bizarre clothes made them
outcasts.
   ``It's about coming from somewhere where you're really not
accepted,'' says Katarina Markovic, 22, a would-be fashion designer
and club regular from Louisville, Ohio. ``We are here because we
don't fit in somewhere else.''
   ``I started out as an Ivy League student at Columbia, started
going to clubs and found it was more fun,'' says Jeff Bankoff, 20,
an emigre from a Boston suburb who has since transferred to a
less-demanding college.
   Michael Alig, 21, came to New York from South Bend, Ind., to
attend Fordham University. But after his introduction to the clubs,
he too transferred to an easier school. Today he works as a party
promoter, earning $1,000 from club owners for each bash he throws.
   He chooses his guests from 12 mailing lists of 1,500 names each,
devises a theme ranging from Hawaiian luaus to television
commercials, hires the entertainment, orders the food and plays host.
   The most outrageous parties are mentioned in the half-dozen
periodicals devoted to the club scene or in the gossip columns of
the daily tabloids. Good press and fabulous parties provide clubs
with the reputations they need to attract people who pay $15 a head
to get in.
   In contrast, club kids usually get in for free. The trick is to
dress outrageously and know the doorman _ another source of club
employment, one that pays up to $100 for a three-hour shift.
   At 1 a.m. on one winter Tuesday, yuppies, businessmen, and
sedately dressed college students wait in line outside M.K., a
Manhattan club, as the woman working the door whisks Alig and two
pals inside. Alig wears makeup, shorts made of fake fur, and
suspenders. His roommate wears a cowboy costume. With them is a
19-year-old girl in a decollete black dress.
   ``Those people are expedited into the clubs,'' explains Frank
Roccio, who owns The World, an East Village club. ``They are the
happening people, but aside from that, they entertain as well. We
want to look at those kids. We want to watch them cavort. Part of
the entertainment of the evening is to go home and say, `Did you see
that guy with the blond wig and spangled eye shadow?'''
   Bizarre decor and odd locales help set the clubs'
anything-can-happen mood. M.K. features a wall lined with bones, and
because it is housed in a former bank, giant vault doors open out
onto the dance floor.
   The hot new club Mars, which opened in January, is housed in a
warehouse in Manhattan's meat-packing district at 10th Avenue and
13th Street _ described by the New Yorker magazine as ``a location
that would kill your mother if she knew where you were.'' Renovating
the five-story building cost $1 million and the decorations include
a wall of computer chipboards, a rusted piano, old television sets,
and a collection of tribal masks.
   At M.K., entertainment ranges from a ``performance artist'' whose
act consists of yodeling and shrieking, to a man sheathed in yards
of white tulle lying languorously on a sofa beneath a giant canvas
splattered with black and white paint. He wears a woman's wig,
makeup, high heels _ and nothing else.

   On the dance floor, illuminated solely by three red track lights,
the crowd boogies to acid-house music, a repetitive, fast-paced form
of disco with little melody, lots of computer tones, and a generous
helping of old dance tracks, remixed and played at mind-numbing
volume.
   One popular cut, by the British band Bam Bam, is called ``Where's
Your Child?'' The musical question is answered with a deep, sinister
echoing laugh and a single word: ``Ecstasy.''
   The reference is to a mood-altering, amphetamine-based pill. Drug
Enforcement Administration agents say they can't find ecstasy _
formally known as MDMA _ on the streets. In the clubs, regulars buy
it for $20 a hit.
   A 23-year-old art gallery worker describes a typical evening: ``I
go to the clubs, do ex, and go to work tripping the next day.''
   While some say ecstasy is the club kids' drug of choice, others
say it is merely a fad. Michael Musto, who covers the club scene for
the Village Voice, says those who take ecstasy are ``a minuscule
portion of the population.''
   Club owner Roccio agrees that alcohol is the substance most often
abused by the club crowd. The drinking age in New York is 21, but
clubs can admit 16- to 20-year-olds if they don't serve them liquor
_ a law that is often winked at.
   But what's more striking in the clubs than either drug or alcohol
abuse is the highly charged sexual atmosphere. Women wear leather
bras as outerwear and skirts that are 10 inches long from waistline
to hem. Male go-go dancers wear Jockey shorts and sneakers.
   Musto says the antics sometimes get out of hand. In one case, he
says, a participant in a wet T-shirt contest was nearly gang-raped
by clamoring spectators before she was rescued by her boyfriend.
   Roccio also sees ``a new wildness'' on the club scene. ``I think
there is a revived sexual awakening...We're going through the
terrible, terrible reality of the AIDS crisis, and like anything
else, we're seeing a backlash on the part of the younger people,''
he says.
   Fear of AIDS dissuades most people from the one-night stands that
were common on the New York disco scene in the late 1970s and early
'80s. Instead, says Musto, scanty clothing and X-rated entertainment
constitute ``a sexual three-ring circus. You can't have sex, so you
can at least watch a bizarre variation.''
   The club kids are blase. Despite ``the nudity and outrageous
dress, people are going home alone,'' says Andy Anderson, 23, a
native of Missouri.
   As for the sex antics inside the clubs, a 19-year-old known on
the club circuit as Julie Jewels says: ``It was all in fun _ it
wasn't dangerous.''
   Like many club kids, Jewels has adopted a pseudonym and
cultivates an image to match. She wears a long, blonde hairpiece and
low-cut, tight dresses, slit up the side, often sequined or black,
that she designs herself. She came from the Soviet Union 10 years
ago and says her father doesn't mind her club-hopping, as long as
she finishes her education at Hunter College.
   Jewels' 15 minutes of celebrity have arrived. She was recently
photographed by Mademoiselle magazine for an article on clubs, and
she even has imitators known as ``Julie Jewels Wannabes.''
   Other club kids speak proudly of phone calls from radio programs,
MTV and mainstream magazines for stories on ecstasy and acid-house
music. But it's fame on the club circuit that really counts. If the
person working the door recognizes you, you've made it.
   Roccio, the 40-year-old father of an 18-year-old girl, says the
quest for fame began with the club kids' baby-boomer parents.
   ``We grew up in a world where everyone was going to be
exceptional, where everyone was going to be someone,'' he explains.
``The Beatles were just four guys from Liverpool. Elvis was just
some guy from Tupelo.''
   He adds: ``We made our kids feel they had every right to be
stars.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ She was sentenced to life in prison plus 50 years
for shooting to death one of her children and seriously wounding two
others in Oregon. Now imprisoned in New Jersey, following an escape
attempt, Elizabeth Diane Downs is looking forward to a wedding, if
prison officials will allow it, and publication of still another
book about her trial.

   Convicted child killer Elizabeth Diane
Downs, who describes herself as the most hated woman in America,
giggles nervously as she talks of her plans to marry a former police
officer from Oregon.
   The 33-year-old former mail carrier, one of Oregon's most
notorious criminals of modern times, also smiles a lot when she
talks about a new book about her trial which is due out this spring.
   Ms. Downs was sentenced to life in prison plus 50 years for
killing her 7-year-old daughter and wounding her two other children
on a rural road outside Springfield, Ore., on May 19, 1983. An
appeal of the conviction was set aside without comment on Jan. 4.
   She was transferred to the Correctional Institution for Women in
New Jersey after she escaped in July 1987 by scaling a fence at the
Oregon Women's Correctional Center in Salem. She remained at large
for 10 days until she was found with a group of men less than a mile
from the prison.
   Prison authorities believe she has less chance of escaping in New
Jersey because she doesn't know anybody here and she would have no
place to run.
   Prison guards at Clinton say Ms. Downs keeps to herself, but
associates say she thrives on publicity. As one guard put it, ``The
last thing her ego needs is another interview.''
   ``She sees a camera and her whole world brightens,'' says Ann
Rule, a Seattle-based author whose book, ``Small Sacrifices'' about
the Downs case rode the best-seller list of The New York Times for
25 weeks this year.
   ``I don't believe she has any emotion for her children beyond the
fact that they're her possession and somebody took them away from
her.''
   Prosecutors charged that the children were shot because Ms. Downs
believed they interfered in her relationship with a boyfriend who
did not want to be a father.
   Ms. Downs contends that a stranger flagged down her car shot her
and the children. She was wounded by a single bullet in the left arm.
   ``What happened the night of the shooting was so horrendous, so
unexpected, so unbelievable,'' Ms. Downs said in a recent jailhouse
interview. ``I'm very self-disciplined and I need to have control of
my own existence. I just reached a point of not knowing what was
real and what wasn't.''
   Cheryl Lynn Downs, 7, was killed. Fourteen year-old Christie Ann
was left handicapped in her speech, 9-year-old Danny is paralyzed
from the waist down. The lead prosecutor in the case, Lane County
Assistant District Attorney Fred Hugi, adopted the children.
   Ms. Downs says she spends her time exchanging letters with her
new fiance, whom she described as a former police officer who saw
her on ``The Oprah Winfrey show'' and wrote her because he felt
sorry for her.
   ``Anybody who would want to be involved with the most hated woman
in America must be a nut,'' Ms. Downs says. ``But he's not a wacko.
He's genuine.''
   She declines to indentify the man except that he's a former
Oregon police officer who has since moved to New Jersey.
   ``I'm lucid. I've been married before and I said I never would do
it again. But I'm in love,'' said Ms. Downs, who was married for
eight years to Steve Downs, an electrician and farm laborer.
   Kim White, a state Corrections Department spokeswoman, confirmed
that Ms. Downs has asked the department for permission to marry the
man. Ms. White also would not identify him.
   She said the couple are in the preliminary stages of applying for
permission to marry. They still must meet with the prison chaplain
and obtain the approval of the superintendent who submits the
request to a committee for a recommendation.
   New Jersey does not permit conjugal visits, she added.
   Ms. Downs, who earned an associate's degree in general studies
while imprisoned in Oregon, has also completed a book, ``Best-Kept
Secrets,'' scheduled for release in April by Danmark Publishing,
based in Springfield, Ore. About 75 percent of the 350-page book
will be direct quotes from the trial transcript, Ms. Downs said.
   A spokesman for Danmark says that any profits from the book will
go to the state of Oregon under a law passed in the wake of the
Downs case.
   Its release surely will spark more discussion of the case, but
Ms. Downs says she doesn't believe her children will suffer if
people talk about her case.
   ``How could the truth hurt the kids?'' Ms. Downs says. ``I get so
frustrated when I hear things like that...How can the truth hurt
anybody unless they're a liar?''
   But Ms. Rule says the truth that she observed in the nine-month
trial was a guilty Ms. Downs, who was pregnant at the time with
another child, who was later put up for adoption.
   ``I've never seen anyone as manipulative as Diane,'' Ms. Rule
says, describing her as ``sociopathic, histrionic and narcissistic.''
   ``I think she knows what she did,'' Ms. Rule says. ``The truth is
buried so deep that she doesn't have to think about it. She's not
crazy though.''
   But Ms. Downs denies her guilt and says the bonds between her and
her children remain.
   ``They're part of my body that broke away,'' she says. ``They
love me but at the same time they're uncomfortable with ever being
with me again.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Louisiana Chef Paul Prudhomme put the redfish in
dire peril when he spread the word across the land how good they
were blackened in a hot skillet with Cajun-style hot spices. Not to
worry. Enterprising fish farmers are now learning how to grow them
domestically, not unlike the way catfish are farmed.

   It's enough to make a Cajun drool.
   Robert Hunt has millions of pounds of redfish. He has baby
redfish and 40-year-old monsters, and all sizes in between.
   Down a sandy road, a couple of miles from the beach, Hunt has
redfish growing so fast in 31 acres of ponds and tanks that he
thinks they'll take less than two years to go from tiny fingerlings
to three pounds or better _ ready for cooking.
   Hunt is one of several entrepreneurs who hope to save the Cajun
delicacy _ even the redfish itself _ from extinction.
   It all started when Louisiana Chef Paul Prudhomme flipped a
redfish into a white-hot iron skillet and charred it in deep spices,
setting off a national craze for blackened redfish.
   ``Mr. Prudhomme did a very good job,'' says Ted Brennan of
Brennan's Restaurant in the New Orleans' French Quarter. ``Blackened
redfish has become part of the restaurant folklore in New Orleans,
along with oysters Rockefeller and bananas Foster. People from all
over the country want it.
   ``It's not just in New Orleans that people demanded it. It would
be hard to go into any major city in the country and not find
blackened redfish on a menu somewhere.''
   Prudhomme says he doesn't understand; blackened tuna would be
just as good.
   Indeed, when the demand for redfish grew great enough to threaten
the very existence of the species, New Orleans restaurants changed
the menu to feature other blackened fish, especially other members
of the drum family.
   Last year, the state of Louisiana, alarmed by the depletion of
redfish in the Gulf of Mexico, stopped all commercial fishing
through 1991 and banned the sale of redfish caught off Louisiana
until 1992.
   Conservation officials said the redfish catch, estimated at
54,000 pounds in 1980, jumped to 5.4 million pounds in 1986 as the
Cajun craze spread. Facing predictions that the catch could hit 20
millions pounds annually, concerned federal conservationists stepped
in and state officials followed suit, virtually stopping fishing for
red drum in the Gulf.
   After the shutdown, demand for the fish grew so that an
underground market developed, leading to arrests at the kitchen
doors of some of New Orleans' classiest restaurants.
   With that kind of market, men like Hunt thought it would be worth
the effort to find a way to farm redfish _ unique problems
notwithstanding. After all, catfish farming has become commonplace
in Louisiana and Misssissippi ponds.
   But redfish are saltwater creatures that thrive in wide-ranging
environments, running from spawning grounds in the Louisiana marshes
to far out in the Gulf. How do you pen up game fish and coax them to
live and breed in captivity?
   Hunt had one idea. He set up set stainless steel tanks at Pass
Christian, not far from the Louisiana state line. Other farmers are
trying submerged cages and blocked-off canals in the Louisiana marsh.
   At his Redfish Hatchery Inc., Hunt has created a perpetual spring
for about a dozen fish. They mate regularly in the dim waters of
three spawning tanks.
   When the fingerlings reach a certain size they are transferred to
ponds, which have pure oxygen pumped into them.
   Hunt says the technique he worked out can produce marketable
redfish rapidly.
   ``By loading the water with oxygen we can practically watch the
redfish grow,'' he says.
   He predicts the ponds will produce over a million pounds of
redfish a year, averaging three to five pounds each.
   Hunt says the one-acre ponds cost about $25,000 to build, not
including the costs of a well to supply the water. But there is a
potential for profit. When sales stopped, redfish fillets were
selling at $5.35 a pound in New Orleans seafood markets.
   Although redfish will survive in full-strength sea water or
barely salty water, some salinity is needed, and the closer the fish
farm is to sea water, the fewer problems growers experience.
   In St. Mary Parish, the salt comes from a pool atop a salt dome.
Sugar cane farmer Walter Landry turned 25 acres into a redfish pond
by drilling a well at the dome and mixing that with fresh water to
produce the equivalent of sea water.
   Landry hopes to market redfish from the pond every 22 months,
with his first crop due in midsummer.
   Another group of investors is raising redfish in abandoned oil
canals in the South Louisiana marsh. They are betting that the fish
will thrive in natural conditions.
   Efforts to grow a marketable product include blocking off the
ends of dead-end canals and filling them with fingerlings, and
raising the small fish in cages.
   ``We have about 55,000 fish in the water in eight cages,'' says
Gary Lee of Mariculture Enterprises Inc.
   Lee says his group has invested $250,000 and a lot of sweat in
the venture, but expects to see a profit in the long run.
   ``We should have fish ready to see by the fall,'' he says.
``It'll be three years until we see any profit, but long-range, we
expect it to pay off.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ To leaders of the feminist movement, Martha
Griffiths is a legend in her own time, a congresswoman instrumental
in getting the Equal Rights Amendment through Congress even though
it failed to be ratified by enough states.Now 77 and serving as
Michigan's lieutenant governor, Griffiths predicts the ERA will be
added to the U.S. Constitution this century, if the case for the
amendment is argued on economic terms.

   Feminists are readying a second try at
ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, but this time they'll
have to do it without the help of former congresswoman Martha
Griffiths.
   It was Griffiths, now Michigan's 77-year-old lieutenant governor,
who stalked the halls of Congress to get the 218 signatures needed
to pull the ERA out of a House committee and onto the floor for
debate, clearing the way for its eventual overwhelming approval by
Congress in 1972.
   But the amendment was ratified by only 35 state legislatures,
three short of the number needed to add it to the U.S. Constitution.
   ``I think part of the problem is that it's also associated with
rights for minorities and you'd be surprised how much racism there
still is in this world,'' says Griffiths, a Democrat.
   ``Another thing, some men resent tremendously the idea of a woman
coming into their offices and really having a chance at promotion.''
   Griffiths predicts the amendment will be ratified this century as
young women become more aware of discrimination.
   The next time around, she says, the case for the amendment should
be presented in economic terms. ``I never had anybody objecting to
my trying to get more money for their working wives.''
   She says women themselves are partially to blame for not being
more aggressive in seeking promotions and asking for equal
treatment. ``I think a lot of women just won't do it,'' she says.
   Griffiths, now in her second four-year term as lieutenant
governor, never displayed such reluctance when it came to fighting
for women.
   Born Martha Wright in Pierce City, Mo., on Jan. 29, 1912,
Griffiths is descended from a family that homesteaded in the area.
   ``My father thought that girls were as smart as boys and he
encouraged me,'' said Griffiths, who grew up going squirrel hunting
alongside the boys, out-shooting them because of her steady hands.
   She attended the University of Missouri, where she met her future
husband, Hicks G. Griffiths. They attended the University of
Michigan law school together, graduating in 1940 as the
institution's first married couple.
   After working together for a Detroit insurance company, the two
established their own law firm in 1946. They worked on the
successful gubernatorial campaign of G. Mennen ``Soapy'' Williams in
1948.
   Griffiths was elected to the state Legislature and in 1952 ran
for Congress. She lost, but won the seat two years later and became
the first woman to serve on the House Ways and Means Committee.
   ``There is where you find how badly women have been treated,''
she says of the tax-writing panel.
   One of Griffith's early targets was Social Security, which she
said required women to pay in as much as men but paid women and
their children less benefits when they retired or died.
   ``What kind of nonsense was that?'' she asks rhetorically.
   Griffiths wrestled with the complexities of Social Security and
inheritance tax laws, but her greatest achievement involved adding
the word ``sex'' to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
   The effect was to outlaw discrimination against women, blacks and
members of other racial minorities and create the basis for
countless lawsuits.
   Her amendment caught potential opponents flat-footed and it
passed before members of Congress knew what they had done.
   ``It was a glorious accident,'' she says. ``It really changed
America.''
   Feminist leaders revere her.
   ``She's a legend in her own time,'' says Marian McCracken, former
president of the National Organization for Women and Michigan's
representative on NOW's national board.
   ``She understood sex discrimination way before her time, way
before other people did and tried to use her position to do
something about it,'' says Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for
a Feminist Majority, whose goal is to elect more women to public
office.
   Griffiths says the push for the ERA changed women's lives even
though the amendment did not pass.
   ``Scores, if not hundreds, of acts were passed at the state,
local and federal level, eliminating the worst of the
discriminations,'' she says, adding that ERA opponents thought such
concessions could blunt the drive for the amendment's passage.
   Griffiths surprised the state in 1974 by deciding against
returning to Congress after her 10th term. She said she had tired of
commuting after two decades.
   She was serving on a number of corporate boards, earning $360,000
a year, when then-U.S. Rep. James Blanchard picked her to be his
running mate in 1982.
   Critics say Griffiths is getting too old to preside over the
state Senate, where she has been known to hush noisy senators during
debate.
   ``Reagan, who just left the presidency, is a year older than I,
so what are they really talking about? What they're really talking
about is a woman. They object to a woman doing anything,'' she says.
   ``That's really it. But when you put it to a vote, the people
accept me.''
   Despite her crusty comments, Griffith has the air of a
grandmother with her white hair, wrinkled face, and slow walk. She
has grandmotherly feelings, too, carrying pictures of her
secretaries' children in her purse and lining her office halls with
paintings of children. Griffiths had no children.
   ``I suppose you don't regret what you've never had, but I have
enjoyed other people's children,'' she says.
   Despite her age, Griffiths keeps a heavy schedule. Once when
Blanchard's office asked for a list of her engagements since taking
office, Griffiths' staff needed three days to compile an 80-page
list containing 900 speeches.
   Griffiths hasn't decided whether to remain on the ticket if
Blanchard runs again for governor in 1990.

   Dean Stockwell says his role as an outrageous
and flamboyant gangster in ``Married To the Mob'' opened a new
career for him in comedy.
   It led to his first television series, NBC's ``Quantum Leap,'' a
comic adventure about time travel in which he appears only as a
hologram.
   ``Marriedso brought Stockwell his first
nomination for an Academy Award as best supporting actor.
   ``It's something I've dreamed about for years,''  To the Mob'' alhe
says. ``The
reality is...I can't describe it. It's just one of the best feelings
I've ever had.''
   Just before he committed himself to ``Quantum Leap,'' Stockwell
says, he was working with Orion Pictures on a series pilot based on
his character of Tony the Tiger in ``Married To the Mob.''
   ``But they took too long to put it together,'' he says. ``Then
Don Bellisario called and offered me this. It's the first time
anyone's offered me a series and the first time I've ever wanted to
do one. If people hadn't seen me in ``Married To the Mob' they
wouldn't have realized I could do comedy.''
   Stockwell and Scott Bakula star in ``Quantum Leap'' as physicists
who are working on a time travel experiment. Bakula isrch.
   In ``Married To the Mob,'' Stockwell was Tony ``The Tiger''
Russo, a character who's right up there with Scarface, Little Caesar
and the rest, but is still charming and personable and in a
perverted way is like a yuppie hood.
   Stockwell says he is into his ``third career.''
   His father was Harry Stockwell, a Broadway performer who replaced
Alfred Drake in ``Oklahoma.'' He was the voice of Prince Charming in
Walt Disney's ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.''
   As a child, Dean Stockwell appeared on Broadway in ``Innocent
Voyage.''
   The studio scouts saw him and he was in such movies as ``Anchors
Aweigh,'' ``The Boy with Green Hair,'' ``Gentlemen's Agreement'' and
``Kim.''
   ``I was very lucky to have a loving and caring and sympathetic
mother and not a stage mother,'' he says. ``She was very helpful to
me as a child. It wasn't always easy.
   ``I dropped out of acting a few times. I quit when I was 16 and
didn't come back until I was 21. When I came back I did
`Compulsion,' `Long Day's Journey Into the Night,' `Sons and Lovers'
and `Rapture.'''
   Stockwell dropped out again in the 1960s to become a hippie.
   ``I never really wanted to be an actor,'' he says. ``I found
acting very difficult from the beginning. I worked long hours, six
days a week. It wasn't fun. I came back each time because I had no
other training.''
   The second time he returned, Stockwell found it very difficult to
get re-established. It wasn't until he did ``Paris, Texas'' that he
felt he had made it. ``Out of sight, out of mind,'' he says. ``Luck
has a lot to do with it.''
   Since then, he's done ``To Live and Die in L.A.,'' ``Dune,''
``Beverly Hills Cop II,'' ``Gardens of Stone,'' ``Blue Velvet'' and
the TV movie ``Gambler III.''
   In ``Tucker,'' he played Howard Hughes. He co-stars with Dennis
Hopper and Jodie Foster in ``Backtrack'' and with Kim Cattrell in
``Palais Royale.''
   Stockwell makes his permanent home in New Mexico with his wife,
Joy, and their two children, Austin and Sophia.
   Stockwell hopes his brother, Guy, can appear with him in an
episode of ``Quantum Leap.'' Their last time acting together was in
``Innocent Voyage'' on Broadway 40 years ago. Guy had been in a
number of movies and was in such series as ``Adventures in
Paradise'' and ``The Richard Boone Show.'' In recent years he has
devoted most of his time to teaching.

   In the basement of the student union building
at Duke University, a nervous Ellen Simon fidgeted in the last row
of a small, dark studio theater.
   She sat as far away as possible from her father, playwright Neil
Simon, and her former stepmother, actress Marsha Mason. They were at
Duke, along with her younger sister, Nancy, to attend the world
premiere of ``Moon and Valentino,'' the first play by the
31-year-old Miss Simon to make it to the stage.
   Throughout the evening, Miss Mason leaned forward, hanging on to
each word of dialogue. Simon kept taking off his glasses and wiping
his eyes. When the play was over and the hearty applause diminished,
the four embraced in the tiny theater's cramped aisle.
   ``It was a special joy, that first experience, listening to the
play on stage,'' Simon said the next day. ``Now we can be more
objective about it.''
   ``Moonlight and Valentino'' is personal, even painful, but like
her famous father's plays, it also is filled with laughter. And like
Simon's ``Chapter Two'' and his ``Brighton Beach'' trilogy, it
echoes the playwright's own life.
   The play concerns a young woman whose husband is killed in an
automobile accident and how she copes with his death. Miss Simon's
husband, Jeffrey Bishop, an astrophysicist, died in November 1987
when he was struck by a car while out jogging.
   For Miss Simon, ``Moonlight and Valentino'' goes beyond her own
experience.
   ``I feel that the personal aspect is limited to the fact that I
know what it's like to go through intense grief, to go through a
jarring, sudden loss and to be left, all of a sudden, with an
enormous mountain to climb and not knowing whether you are going to
make it,'' she said.
   ``The fact is that I did find myself at the bottom of the
mountain, did climb it somehow, bolstered by friends, family and my
son, Andrew. I got up there and was changed, by not running away
from the grief but by experiencing it. That's what made me want to
write it.''
   Miss Simon, who had her own dance troupe and worked as a
choreographer, has always been a writer, turning out short stories
and even starting a novel at age 15. That was the year her mother,
Simon's first wife, Joan, died of cancer. She wrote another play and
a screenplay before attempting ``Moonlight and Valentino.'' Neither
was any good, she says.
   But her father and Emanuel Azenberg, who produces Simon's plays
on Broadway, encouraged her to continue.
   ``Bigger,'' counseled Azenberg. ``Write something bigger.''
   Simon was more cautious about his daughter's writing career.
   ``I think my father was frightened the first time I showed him a
script,'' Miss Simon said. ``What if it wasn't good? What was he
going to say to me? But he read it and, I think, was relieved. Then
he gave me a lot of criticism.''
   Both the screenplay and that first play remain in her bottom
drawer, unproduced.
   Not so with ``Moonlight and Valentino.'' The play was given a
reading last July in New York. Azenberg brought it to Duke, where he
teaches a course in the school's drama program, for a two-week
workshop production in February. Further development is possible,
probably at Stages Repertory Theater in Houston later this year.
When it will come to New York, no one is sure.
   ``Once I knew why I wanted to write it, which was to talk about
transformation and if pain comes to you, don't avoid it, almost
embrace it because there is an opportunity there,'' Miss Simon says.
``Once I established what I wanted to say, the characters came not
so much from my life but from the need to create conflict within the
play.''
   Miss Simon's heroine, Rebecca, is comforted in her grief by a
chain-smoking sister, a dizzy best girlfriend whose marriage is
falling apart, and an acerbic ex-stepmother who still cares for her
former husband's children.
   ``I knew `Moonlight and Valentino' couldn't be one woman's
journey,'' Miss Simon says. ``I knew it had to be four women's
journeys, bring them to a point of realization in their own lives.
There's a line in the play about the house attracting `widows of all
sorts.' That's what I wanted to write about.''
   The play also has one male character _ a handsome house painter
nicknamed `Valentino' by the women. Although he has no lines, the
painter is an important part of the play. He's a symbol of the
possibility of a new life, a rebuilding after tragedy.
   Miss Simon began writing ``Moonlight and Valentino'' four months
after her husband's death. She finished the first draft in 19 days.
   ``I never let it alone,'' she says. ``I spent 10 hours a day on
it.''
   From March until November of last year, Miss Simon plowed through
nine full rewrites, something her father is famous for doing.
   ``The only thing I think she may have gotten from me is the
attitude toward the work,'' says Simon, who has had nearly two dozen
plays and musicals produced on Broadway. His latest comedy,
``Rumors,'' has settled in for a long run at the Broadhurst Theater.
   Before the first performance, Simon told his daughter, ``I have a
note pad and I'm going to take notes.''
   ``He came up to me afterward and said, `Here are my notes,'''
Miss Simon recalls. ``It was a blank pad.''
   Now the father ponders how his reputation will affect hers.
   ``She'll have to deal with it,'' he says. ``It's unfortunate, but
it goes with the territory. She has no obligation to be the daughter
of Neil Simon. It's a hindrance to have attention taken away from
what her work is. She doesn't deserve that, and I don't think it
will happen once people see the play.
   ``I think she's going to write more plays,'' he adds.
   ``This is not going to be a one-shot playwright. She's just too
good. There's so much in her.''

   Many of the main monuments glorify President Kim, who is hailed
as the ``Great Leader,'' and promote his personality cult.
   At the northern entrance to the city, one monument similar to the
Arch of Triumph in Paris commemorates the 76-year-old Kim's role in
fighting Japan, the colonial ruler of Korea until the end of World
War II. Banners praising Kim are ubiquitous.
   Rising 560 feet above central Pyongyang is the Tower of the Juche
Idea, erected for Kim's 70th birthday. The Juche idea is Kim's own
interpreation of Marxism-Leninism and it stresses political and
economic self-reliance.
   Officials talk with pride of the accomplishments North Korea has
made on its own. Tour guides point out the many new buildings in
Pyongyang, reciting statistics on height, area and length of
construction time.
   One guide surnamed Park said that people throughout the country
of 20.7 million have been brought to Pyongyang to work on the youth
festival projects. Park was unable to give exact figures, but a 1987
report in the Hong Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review said
100,000 soldiers had been diverted to build the Kwangbok
(Liberation) sports complex and other projects.
   Park said that the average monthly salary in Pyongyang is 150 won
($67). Housing, medical care, food and education are free or
provided at a nominal charge. The Seoul government puts the average
monthly income of individual workers in South Korea at about $740.
   The North lags far behind the South in industry and foreign
trade, with Seoul joining Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan as the new
economic dynamos of the Pacific Rim.
   Foreign analysts put Pyongyang's foreign debt at about $4.2
billion and North Korea recently was declared in default of its
overseas loans.
   Also troubling North Korea is its image as having a ruthless
government.
   North Korea was blamed for an assassination attempt in October
1983 on then-President Chun Doo-hwan of South Korea in Rangoon,
Burma. Several top Seoul officials were killed.
   More recently, Pyongyang was accussed of planting a bomb on a
South Korean jetliner that disappeared with 115 people over the
Andaman Sea near Burma in November 1987.
   Before that, North Korean diplomats were expelled from several
countries for smuggling goods to raise money to support their
embassies _ in line with Kim's philosophy of self-reliance.
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Schifter, who heads the
State Department's Human Rights Bureau, said in February that North
Korea is one of the worst violators of human rights. He claimed that
Pyongyang ``tries really to turn people into automatons.''
   Two U.S. human rights organizations, Asia Watch and the Minnesota
Lawyers International Human Rights Committee, recently published a
report saying that the North Korean government ``consistently
deprives citizens of basic human rights and freedoms.''
   North Korea clearly hopes visitors will go away with a different
image.
   ``We are opening up because we want the world to know more about
our country, that we do not arrest people or put people into prison
for no reason,'' tour guide Park said.

   The first glimpse into the cult of
President Kim Il Sung comes as soon as visitors get off the plane at
Pyongyang.
   They are greeted by a huge portrait of the leader for four
decades atop the airport terminal. That is just the beginning.
   Many adults in Pyongyang wear Kim pins on their clothes.
   ``No one will choose not to wear the Great Leader's picture
because we all respect him,'' a tour guide named Park told a group
of visitors from Hong Kong.
   When the visitors asked if they could get a Kim pin as a
souvenir, tour guide Yoon Mu Ho responded: ``We cannot give it or
sell it to you because only followers of Kim and his Juche idea are
entitled to wear this badge.''
   The Juche idea is the 76-year-old Kim's guiding philosophy of
political and economic self-reliance.
   Universities, stadiums and squares are named after him. An
impressive 65-foot bronze statue of Kim graces the Pyongyang city
center. The country is dotted with buildings erected to celebrate
his birthday (he was born April 15, 1912) or to mark his
achievements.
   At one model school shown to the visitors from Hong Kong, every
classroom has a picture of Kim in a gold-colored frame. In a hotel
in Kaesong, 80 miles southeast of Pyongyang, Kim's picture is in
every hotel room as well as the restaurant.
   The ``Great Leader'' also is a constant companion in train and
subway stations, as well as in train and subway cars.
   In paintings portraying Kim receiving foreign visitors, he always
stands confidently while the guests bow or approach him. None of the
pictures show the disfiguring lump that bulges from his neck.
   The official Pyongyang Sinmun (Pyongyang News) uses slightly
larger and darker type for Kim's name, while his speeches are
printed in bold letters. State-run television runs documentaries on
his acheivements regularly. The capital is filled with banners and
slogans wishing the ``Great Leader'' a healthy and long life.
   Asked what would happen if Kim were to die, tour guide Park said:
``We all hope the `Great Leader' will live long. In our banquets our
first toast is for the health and long life of the `Great Leader'.''
   Kim Il Sung plans to hand power over to his eldest son,
47-year-old Kim Jong Il, in what would be the world's first
Communist dynasty.
   Official publications began praising the younger Kim in 1971,
calling him ``Dear Leader.'' The Pyongyang News also uses larger
type for Kim Jong Il's name and wished him a happy new year on Feb.
9, during the week of the Lunar New Year. In some places, his
picture hangs beside his father's.
   In the official periodical Korea Today, Labor Hero Choe Hak Son
described the role of Kim Jong Il in building a chemical production
complex. The president's son ``solved knotty problems and looked
after our life well so that we could make miraculous achievements
and perform heroic deeds in construction,'' he wrote.
   Even Kim Il Sung's parents and grandparents are glorified in
North Korea as part of the ``revolutionary family.'' Tourists often
are given a tour of Mangyongdae, the village where the leader was
born and spent his childhood. Family pictures and farming tools used
by his relatives are exhibited as a revolutionary guide praises each
family member.

<HEAD>Unexpected Prosperity Causes Strains in Spanish Society</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

   Six years after a Socialist government took
office, Spain has Western Europe's fastest growing economy but also
its highest unemployment rate. The new prosperity has roiled a
once-staid Spanish society and widened the rift between haves an
have-nots.
   Spaniards who once spurned ostentation now are frivolous, big
spenders mesmerized by new financial wheeler-dealers and high-living
politicians.
   The once-stagnant economy has boomed since 1986 at a
European-high 4.5 percent annual growth rate but the unemployment
rate has risen to 18.8 percent from 14.5 percent when the Socialists
took over in 1982.
   Nearly every sector, including moribund steelmaking and
shipbuilding, has returned to prosperity under Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez's market-oriented policies aimed at modernizing industry,
moderating wage increases and curbing inflation.
   But the administration appears to have been caught off guard by
growing popular anger over speculation, misuse of public funds and
high living of Socialist officials.
   ``Spanish society has experienced many and deep changes in its
structure and institutions in a very short time, and this has
affected the value system in a special way,'' Juan Diez Nicolas,
sociology professor at Madrid University, wrote in a recent
newspaper column.
   By late 1985, the government's efforts to encourage domestic
demand to spark an economic recovery started to take effect.
   Rocketing sales at El Corte Ingles department store chain, whose
green and white bags are a middle-class symbol, have made the
company one of the nation's most profitable.
   Spaniards bought more than 1 million new cars last year, up 16
percent from 1987, and 30 percent of them were expensive imports.
   Corporate and bank profits have tripled and quadrupled,
respectively, since 1986, while $16.7 billion from tourism last year
set a new record for the third straight year.
   These revenues helped increase foreign currency reserves since
December 1986 from $16 billion to $39.8 billion, according to the
Bank of Spain.
   ``A cult of money and success like nothing we've ever seen has
grown up in this country,'' says Miguel Roca, spokesman for the 19
deputies of the Catalan Minority Party in the 350-seat Congress of
Deputies, the lower house of Parliament.
   But the boom has left the country's 2.7 million jobless out in
the cold and poverty remains widespread.
   The Socialist General Workers Union and the Communist Workers
Commissions became the bulwark of a social movement demanding the
government focus on improving the lot of the estimated 8 million
people living under the poverty line.
   Secretary General Nicolas Redondo of the General Workers Union,
once a key Gonzalez ally, has accused the Socialists of
``undermining public morality, the patrimony of the left.''
   ``Before it was said that making money was creating wealth and
jobs,'' he said. ``Now it is said that making money is an end in
itself. We are putting aside values such as work, dedication and
saving.''
   Gonzalez took office promising the country's 39 million people a
higher standard for ethics in government.
   But criticism has rained down on his party following allegations
that former administration members have peddled their influence as
high-paid consultants to foreign investors.
   Pilar Miro resigned in disgrace as state television director
after being forced to pay back nearly $35,000 of budget money she
used for clothes to wear to public functions.
   The press questioned why the Ministry of Defense bought Defense
Minister Narcis Serra a baby grand piano for his Madrid apartment.
   Former Economic Minister Miguel Boyer, the architect of the
successful Socialist austerity plan, raised public hackles with his
hob-nobbing with the rich and fudging property assessments on a new
residence he is building.
   Government spokeswoman Rosa Conde calls these incidents
``anecdotal.''
   `Socialists have shown sufficient honesty,'' she said, ``and the
citizens know that.''
   The influential Roman Catholic Bishops Conference has backed
union charges and repeatedly criticized the government for creating
an environment in which ``selfish materialism'' is held as superior
to social solidarity.
   Public anger has also risen because of the strain on the
country's already inadequate social services and infrastructure,
which many claim have been neglected because of the government's
desire to hold down public spending.
   When government-union relations soured late last year, the unions
called a general strike for Dec. 14 to pressure the government to
make a ``move to the left.'' The strike shut down the country for a
day as 8 million of the nation's 12 million workers stayed off the
job.
   The strike stood Spanish politics on its head as the government
found itself rejecting demands from a Socialist union to which it
has been intimately tied, while centrists and right-wing
conservatives cheered the unions on.
   Six weeks of talks collapsed Feb. 7 with the unions rejecting as
insufficient a government offer of $3.3 billion in unemployment,
pension and minimum wage benefits over the next two years.
   More recently, rumors swirled that Gonzalez would resign.
Communists demanded that he step down, and centrists called for
elections earlier than June 1990, when they are required.
   But when Gonzalez delivered his annual state-of-the-union address
Feb. 14, he assailed the unions for rejecting the government's $3.3
billion offer.
   Although a recent poll in the newsweekly Cambio 16 indicated that
support for the Socialists had dropped to 35 percent from the 44
percent in 1986, Gonzalez pledged to maintain his policies ``to
sustain economic growth that is fundamental for the creation of
jobs.''
   Sociologist Maria Angeles Duran says the biggest change and the
biggest problem caused by Spain's much-heralded entry two years ago
into the European Economic Community ``will be the change in values
in a still profoundly Roman Catholic nation brought on by the
growing influence here of individualist and mercantilist values
flowing from Protestant northern Europe.''
   The boom brought forth a new breed of young, aggressive
entrepreneurs, bankers and financiers, some of whom have became
household names by introducing the hostile takeover and merger deals
to the staid Spanish business world.
   The Socialist administration encouraged new blood in top posts in
business. It also encouraged giant bank mergers, even hostile ones,
as necessary to improve Spain's ability to meet competition that
will come with the European Economic Community's removal of internal
trade barriers by the end of 1992.
   Business news has overtaken stories of ideological politics in
the serious newspapers. Readership in the few business dailies has
increased to the point where the papers themselves became targets
for takeover by domestic and foreign investors.
   Spanish publishers plan to launch two more business newspapers
this year.
   U.S., European and Japanese firms and investors have sought to
create a base for EEC access in Spain, and many have bought out
Spanish companies, entered joint-investment arrangements or built
their own plants.
   Direct foreign investment exploded from 1983 to 1988, going from
$1 billion to last year's $4 billion.
   But great fears remain that the Socialists' inability to reach
accords with the unions will lead to demonstrations and strikes
through the month of May.
   Already, top leaders of the General Workers Union are calling for
a debate on whether it should maintain its traditional support for
the Socialists in the next elections.

   The sandbags are gone in Basra, Iraq's second
largest city, after years of battering by the Iranians in the
Persian Gulf war. A new city is rising from the rubble.
   ``It's going to be the best city in Iraq,'' said a bank manager,
who identified himself only as Simon. ``Everything's going to be
new.''
   The scars of ferocious Iranian missile attacks and artillery
bombardments are still everywhere: shrapnel-scarred buildings,
groves of decapitated palm trees, abandoned tanks, sunken ships in
the Shatt-al-Arab waterway that meanders through the city to the
Persian Gulf.
   But the souk, or market, is booming. The Sheraton Hotel on the
bank of the muddy Shatt-Al-Arab, peppered by direct shell hits and
deserted for the last two years, opened for business again in
February.
   It was a dispute over territorial claims to the Statt-al-Arab
that led to the war in 1980.
   The two daily flights from Baghdad, Iraq's capital, to Basra's
newly reopened airport are packed with businessmen, including
construction engineers who have come to lobby officials for
contracts.
   On a recent visit, President Saddam Hussein criticized the slow
pace of rebuilding in a city that symbolized Iraq's defense against
six years of Iranian offensives.
   ``The people of Basra deserve their city to be beautiful and more
organized,'' he said.
   His government has pledged $5 billion to repair the damage and
make Basra the centerpiece of a new international industrial zone.
   Founded 1,400 years ago and known as the Venice of the East
because of its network of canals, Basra was Iraq's main port with a
prewar population of 1.5 million. It is just 15 miles from Iran.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Iranian forces battled to within
six miles of Basra's eastern outskirts in early 1987, putting it
within easy artillery range.
   In the bombardments, 90 percent of Basra's buildings were
destroyed or damaged. Thousands of civilians were killed or wounded
and thousands more fled.
   The port is still blocked because the Shatt Al-Arab is an issue
in the Iran-Iraq peace talks.
   The first major construction project nearby is 23 new piers for
what were minor ports at Um Qasr and Khour el-Zubiar before the war.
   The main work in Basra since the Aug. 20 cease-fire has been
clearing the wreckage.
   Arfan, one of the engineers looking for contracts in Basra,
noted: ``Right now they're just cleaning up, but by the end of the
year there will be lots of work in Basra.''
   Heavy trucks, graders and cranes _ many of them from the military
_ growl through downtown. Hundreds of new apartment buildings,
ringed by fields of mud, have gone up.
   Many were occupied even before they were completed, with
residents using corrugated iron sheets to cover the still-empty
windows.
   In the souk, merchants say they can't keep up with consumer
demand, even though prices have gone up by as much as 25 percent.
   ``We're selling more and more,'' said Mohammed Aslan Mohsen, who
runs an appliances store.
   At the Sheraton Hotel, manager William Meuree, a Belgian, said it
took two days of cleaning the rugs before the colors started to
emerge from the dust.
   The sign above the entrance hangs askew and the acne of artillery
hits across the front of the building is still visible under
concrete patches.
   Meuree said 99 percent of the damage from several direct hits has
been repaired, and 130 out of the 210 rooms reopened.
   Visitors from Baghdad and Kuwait come for the weekend. Many want
rooms looking out over three sunken freighters in the Shatt-al-Arab,
the estuary of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that runs into the
Persian Gulf. At least 70 ships are stranded there.
   ``Unfortunately there aren't enough rooms on the river to satisfy
everyone,'' said Meuree.
   Basra had a prewar reputation for serendipity as Kuwaits escaping
their nation's alcohol ban made it their weekend watering hole.
   ``They're coming back slowly, it's not like before,'' said
Khamis, the Sheraton's bartender, who estimated that he serves 50
people every weekend night. ``They come to drink, to enjoy
themselves.''
   Down the road from the Sheraton a new nightclub has opened,
surrounded by a wall of plants and black statues of naked women.
   In the neighborhood behind it, residents said everyone who fled
the shelling is back.
   Dawla, a 49-year-old mother of seven, fled in 1986 after bombs
shattered every window in the house and killed a man praying in the
neighborhood mosque.
   The house was missing walls and was partially looted when she
came back after the cease-fire, but it's been rebuilt.
   ``If there's a war again I'll never leave my house,'' she said.

   _ In Yakima, Wash., the DEA office covering 11 largely rural
counties made 143 arrests last year. ``The only thing that keeps it
from being greater is manpower and money,'' Dreisbach said.
   _ In Georgia, three Americans and six Panamians last year were
convicted of or pleaded guilty to importing about 161 kilos of
cocaine from Panama, via U.S. Army planes, commercial flights or
mail packages sent to Moultrie, Ga. The drugs were then sent to New
York, officials said. Three of the nine had Army ties.
   ``This case is about as hometown as you can get,'' said Bill
Malarney, agent-in-charge of the DEA office in Columbus, Ga. ``You'd
expect a big city to have these problems. But this is a small
southern town and here, you were having cocaine delivered in the
mail!''
   Despite the large number of arrests, most rural drug cases are
smaller, but still take considerable manpower. In Dodge County,
Minn., for instance, undercover officers spent three months
arranging the purchase of 25 pounds of marijuana from two men, who
were charged in December.
   Prosecutors acknowledge many of these cases wouldn't make it into
urban drug-clogged courts.
   ``A lot of what we do here wouldn't be prosecuted in Miami,''
said Murphy, the Iowa prosecutor. ``A kilo of cocaine is of no
special significance for Miami, Los Angeles or a border state.''
   There are other differences. Rural authorities don't have to
contend with heavily armed big-city gangs and may benefit from
small-town residents less tolerant of drug dens in their towns.
   Ironically, though, the everybody-knows-everybody network makes
it harder for undercover agents to operate. Even on rural roads
they're quickly noticed.
   ``It's harder to sneak up on the guy,'' Malarney said. ``You're
talking about a quarter of a mile between houses and there's one
road.''
   But small-town dealers also know how to be inconspicuous.
   ``They don't drive a Cadillac,'' Stevens said. ``They'll drive a
pickup truck. You don't see diamonds and gold ... Everybody knows
them for 20 miles. How can they show up with a $20,000 car and build
a $100,000 house? They're just socking it away.''
   ``If people think they can move to rural areas to get away from
drugs, they're wrong,'' he added. ``There's no place else to go
anymore.''

   Two years ago, author Joseph Wambaugh was
intrigued by newspaper accounts about how the murderer of two
teen-age girls in England was discovered through a new process of
identification called genetic fingerprinting.
   The writer of the best-selling police stories, ``The Onion
Field'' and ``The Choir Boys,'' headed for Leicester, the English
city where the murders took place. He conducted extensive interviews
with local police, the victims' families and others, and used the
information for the basis of his new book, ``The Blooding'' ($18.95,
William Morrow), a non-fictional account of what happened.
   But the book's graphic details of the rapes and murders of Lynda
Mann and Dawn Ashworth have prompted Leicester police to look into
how Wambaugh acquired his information. They said ``The Blooding''
contains ``distasteful'' details that could cause further distress
to the families involved.
   Wambaugh seemed visibly shaken by the investigation when he
talked about the issue in a recent interview.
   ``It's very upsetting, it's keeping me up at nights,'' said the
52-year-old writer.
   ``I'm worried that the parents, once they start down the slope of
publicly complaining about the treatment of their private lives,
will not be able to retreat back to common sense when they read and
understand what I've done.''
   Chief Constable Michael Hirst of the Leicester County police has
written to the book's British publishers, Bantam, about the book's
closely detailed description of the attacks on Mann and Ashworth,
both 15 when they died.
   The parents of one of the girls had complained to Hirst, and to
avoid any suggestion that the police endorsed the book, Hirst asked
Bantam to remove an acknowledgment of the constabulary's help from
the book.
   Bantam said Hirst's letter arrived after the book was printed,
and it was too late to remove the acknowledgment.
   Wambaugh contacted Robin and Barbara Ashworth but has been unable
to alleviate the situation.
   ``I'm trying desperately,'' he said. ``I've written two letters
and have gotten one response, which was not good from my point of
view. I just feel that Robin Ashworth has gone down the road too far
with the poisoned atmosphere and will be unable to read the work
objectively.
   ``As we sat and talked together, repeatedly they uttered the same
things, that it's not knowing that's the most awful thing. Very
often we let our imaginations run wild and if we know we can lay the
ghosts to rest and finish it off. Well I told them what happened.''
   On the evening of Nov. 21, 1983, Mann was raped and murdered in
the village of Narborough while walking down a dark footpath called
the ``Black Pad.'' Despite an exhaustive police investigation, the
murderer was not captured and the incident faded into the background.
   But nearly three years later the killer struck again, this time
in broad daylight, when Dawn Ashworth was raped and murdered while
walking on a village footpath called ``Ten Pound Lane.'' Police
received a tip about the suspicious behavior of a kitchen porter, a
confession was obtained and the case seemed to be finally settled.
   However, the kitchen porter's father had read about a scientific
breakthrough called genetic fingerprinting, developed in the
mid-1980s by Leicester geneticist Alec Jeffreys, who discovered that
every person's blood or semen has a genetic code as distinctive as a
fingerprint.
   A sample of the kitchen porter's blood was taken and the test
showed that his genetic print did not match the semen samples taken
from the bodies of the two girls.
   The police launched a massive ``blooding'' program, testing every
male in the vicinity who was born between Jan. 1, 1953 and Dec. 31,
1970. When an employee at a local bakery revealed that he had been
persuaded by Colin Pitchfork, a co-worker, to take the test for him,
police tracked down the suspect. Pitchfork was tested and charged
with the murders.
   Wambaugh tells the story in a matter-of-fact manner. The rapes
are depicted in detail, reading like a well prepared police report.
There is no real ``message'' in ``The Blooding,'' outside of how
genetic fingerprinting could revolutionize crime detection and that
Pitchfork was a sociopath, incapable of feeling remorse for the
crimes.
   ``If there was one single British writer doing a book I was going
to back off. I thought, `It's their country, their story and one of
them should do it. I didn't want to be some carpetbagging Yank.''
   But the author didn't anticipate certain cultural differences,
especially the British need for privacy.
   ``They are reticent people who consider keeping one's mouth shut
a major virtue. With Americans, once they start you can't shut them
up. But the Brits are different. I spent a lot of money on drinks
for a lot of people to get information I needed. I've done a book
that they're not familiar with. They don't like non-fiction crime;
it does not sell well in England.''
   Wambaugh's own interest in the genre came from reading Truman
Capote's 1965 classic, ``In Cold Blood.''
   ``There was his book and there weren't too many others,''
Wambaugh said. ``I was impressed that it could be written exactly in
the style of a novel and be exactly true journalistically.''
   Wambaugh, the son of a police officer, lived in East Pittsburgh
until he was 14 and his family moved to Los Angeles. At age 20, he
developed an interest in literature but decided to become a cop
because he needed a job and the pay was good. But he didn't give up
his desire to write.
   ``The everyday policeman's routine is very rarely exciting and
very rarely satisfying,'' Wambaugh said. ``But when I'd get home at
night or daytime, depending on the shift I worked, I started on that
typewriter. Then I was challenged.''
   His first novel, ``The New Centurions,'' was released in 1971.
Based on his own experiences, it was a fictionalized account of a
Los Angeles policeman's first five years on the force, culminating
with the 1965 race riots in Watts.
   The book sold well and his next novel, ``The Blue Knight,'' did
even better, selling over 1 million copies in paperback alone. ``The
Onion Field,'' released in 1973, was a non-fictional story about the
murder of a police officer in an isolated onion field near
Bakersfield, Calif. A critical and commercial success, Wambaugh
considered ``The Onion Field'' a major breakthrough.
   ``From `Onion Field' on I've really grown,'' said Wambaugh, who
retired from the Los Angeles police force in March 1973 after 13
years on the force.
   He has written 11 books, seven fiction and four non-fiction.
   ``They're both true kinds of writing. Stylistically, I write the
same. I learned that from Capote; you can write the same as long as
you have integrity and don't start writing fiction in a non-fiction
story.''

<HEAD>At The Movies: ``Cousins,'' ``Tap''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Arts Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   ``Cousins''
   
   It is indeed a sad indictment of the Hollywood movie machine to
see its growing reliance on foreign films as a source for new
American movies. The adaptation market seems frenzied these days
with such remakes as ``Three Men and a Baby'' and ``Three
Fugitives.'' It seems the creative and innovative spark of the
world's greatest movie institution has died.
   The latest redo is ``Cousins,'' Joel Schumacher's graceless
treatment of Jean-Charles Tacchella's charming 1976 comedy,
``Cousin, Cousine.''
   Schumacher makes the mistake of trying to closely follow the
original. Both open with a rousing family wedding scene in which the
husband and wife of two different couples meet, run off for a little
sexual fling and leave their respective mates waiting at the
catering hall for their returns. The cuckholded spouses start up a
harmless flirtation and friendship and eventually have an affair of
their own.
   But where the original danced lightly with the passions and
eccentricities of French culture, the new version applies the thin,
moralistic veneer of an American TV sitcom with idiot level dialogue
and conviction. Simply put, the French have a different way of
viewing adultery.
   Ted Danson, as compelling in this role as a bottle of warm, flat
champagne, plays Larry Kozinski who is married to Tish, played with
airhead finesse by Sean Young. Isabella Rossellini, perhaps cast in
this movie to give it some sort of continental class and a little
sunshine, is Maria Hardy, an understanding wife and mother married
to a brutish bore named Tom (William Petersen) who sells Suburus but
who likes to say he sells BMWs.
   The truly comic moments (which were many in ``Cousin, Cousine'')
are diluted in ``Cousins'' by weighty and blunt situations: When Tom
realizes Maria and Larry are also having an affair, he confronts
Larry in typical Hollywood macho style with, ``If you go near my
wife again, I'll kill you.'' Petersen is more Fred Flintstone than
Valentino.
   What saves ``Cousins'' from utter and total oblivion is the
wonderful patter between Larry's father (Lloyd Bridges) and his son,
Mitch (Keith Coogan). Grandpa and grandson have a bucolic moment
over some girlie magazines, and the scene in which Mitch helps
grandpa Vince prepare for a date with Maria's mother (Norma
Aleandro) is worth the ticket price and popcorn.
   A totally unnecessary addition to ``Cousins'' is the subplot
involving the boy-girl problems Tom and Maria's daughter is having
in pre-school. Who cares?
   Perhaps Hollywood will one day realize that some things get lost
in translation. One would think the lesson would have been learned
in 1983 when Jim McBride remade Jean-Luc Godard's classic 1960 film
``Breathless'' into a pathethic and misguided movie. It starred
Richard Gere, who was embarrassing as he attempted to take on the
role Jean-Paul Belmondo had created in the original.
   Something gets lost in the translation as Hollywood puts its neon
wand to French confections.
   If it ain't broke, then don't fix it....
   ``Cousins,'' a Paramount Pictures release produced by William
Allyn, is rated PG-13.

   ``Tap''
   
   Movie audiences have yearned for those splashy, joyous, romantic
musicals of the 1930s, '40s and '50s when boy met girl, boy lost
girl, boy got girl back and everybody lived happily everafter,
dancing all the way to the altar.
   Nick Castle, whose father choreographed many of those wonderful
Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers vehicles, attempts to bring back those
golden dance movies with ``Tap,'' a love letter to hoofers great and
small.
   Starring Gregory Hines and some of the greatest tap kings living,
``Tap'' features excellent dancing and a splendid exuberance.
Unfortunately, the movie holds back; the dance sequences never seem
to totally reach their potential.
   One production number, in which Hines takes a club full of tap
fans out to Times Square to feel and hear the beat and rhythms of
the city (such as cars going over metal plates in the road or
construction crews thumping the pavement) and marks out a dance. The
number starts out well, luring the viewer to the rhythms and moves.
Then it fizzles.
   Another disappointment is the wistful roof-top soft shoe
performed by Hines and the lovely Suzzanne Douglas to ``Cheek to
Cheek.'' It's a romantic Fred and Ginger take-off that never really
gets off. How sad.
   The biggest problem with ``Tap'' is Castle's script and story
line. Max (Hines) is a genius dancer who unfortunately finds
second-story work more to his liking than hoofing. After a stint in
jail, he returns to New York where he hooks up with the hoods again.
At the same time, his mentor, Little Mo (Sammy Davis Jr.) encourages
him to resume his dancing and even tries to turn him on to a new tap
innovation _ amplified shoes.
   The plot, though, gets in the way of the dancing. It's not
compelling, poignant or interesting enough. The tap dancing,
however, is.
   Hines, perhaps the greatest contemporary tap stylist around these
days, is marvelous. His supporting cast includes Savion Glover, a
14-year-old hoofer who one day will make the same claim.
   There are also Sandman Sims, Bunny Briggs, Harold Nicholas, Jimmy
Slyde and Steve Condos _ some of the dancers who helped define and
perfect the art and craft of tap during the 20th century.
   And Douglas, who learned how to tap for the movie, is quite good
for a newcomer.
   Forget about the story. See ``Tap'' as a tribute to the great
ones and to appreciate what tap dancing was all about before
Broadway and Hollywood took away its snap and crackle.
   Produced by Gary Adelson and Richard Vane, the Tri-Star Pictures
release is rated PG-13.

   ``Married to the Mob'' (Orion Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98, Rated
R)
   
   This delightful comedy should not be missed on the little screen
if you didn't see it in theatrical release.
   Angela, the anguished, beauty school-dropout wife of Mafia
soldier Frankie the Pickle, surveys the crated TV sets in her
too-plush, Long Island living room and wails, ``Everything we own
fell off a truck!''
   So there's trouble in Paradise.
   Frankie is fooling around, her son is scamming the neighborhood
kids at three-card monte, and all her creep friends are gangsters'
wives. ``I want a divorce,'' sobs Angela (Michelle Pfeiffer).
   Frankie laughs. You don't divorce the Mob.
   Next thing you know, Angela's a widow and Frankie's ex-boss, capo
Tony the Tiger (Dean Stockwell) is sniffing around her weeds. This
is not lost on Tony's insanely jealous wife, Connie (Mercedes
Ruehl), or the handsome, young, clean-cut FBI agent (Matthew Modine)
who's out to nail Tony the Tiger.
   This is when things start to get complicated.
   ``Married to the Mob,'' directed by Jonathaan Demme, screenplay
by Barry Strugatz and Mark R. Burns, is a genuinely hilarious movie
that is full of bravura performances by actors at the height of
their powers.
   Pfeiffer, who played the icy blond bimbo in ``Scarface'' and the
love interest in ``Tequila Sunrise,'' is more luminously beautiful
than ever. Her character conveys a tough, smart, innocent
vulnerability that is magic.
   Stockwell's portrayal of clever, weasely Tony deserved his
Academy Award nomination (as did his lunatic cameo as Howard Hughes
in ``Tucker''). So did Mercedes Ruehl, whose crazed Connie adds a
joyously funny intensity to the action.
   Ever since ``Citzens' Band'' (as well as ``Melvin and Howard'' or
``Stop Making Sense'' or ``Swimming to Cambodia''), Demme has been
making important American movies. In ``Married to the Mob'' he makes
one that is pure fun.
   Aces.

   ``Bellman and True'' (Cannon Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   Run out and borrow, rent or buy this one. It was my favorite
video of 1988.
   It's an unrelentingly tense caper movie that inexorably notches
up the tension, yet has at its center a beautiful and moving story
of a father and son.
   Bernard Hill plays a burned-out alcoholic, a computer systems
engineer who takes a bribe to deliver a mysterious computer file to
a cheeky, new-breed London ``villain'' (Derek Newark) and his
henchmen.
   The engineer and his stepson (Kieran O'Brien) are held prisoner
until the file is interpreted, and it turns out to be the cash flow
reports and electronic schematic to the ultra-secure branch bank
serving Heathrow Airport.
   Suddenly it is too late to back out. The gang needs a ``bellman''
to handle the bank's electronics. And there is a share of $25
million.
   ``Your life's a bit gray, these days, isn't it, darling?'' says
the cheeky thug.
   Considered only for its ingenious caper, ``Bellman and True''
would be a worthwhile movie, but the relationship of the father and
son is equally important, heightening the sense of value, risk and
loss.
   Novelist Desmond Lowden wrote the tight, fast-paced screenplay
from his book with director Richard Loncraine with Michael Wearing.
Loncraine's headlong direction utterly crisp, atmospheric and
breathless enough to get you on the edge of your seat. The cast is
superlative, every one.
   Highest recommendation.

   ``Flashpoint'' (GRP Records) _ Tom Scott
   
   Saxophonist Tom Scott has played, it seems, with everybody.
   A short list of those he's backed includes Barbra Streisand,
Steely Dan, Paul McCartney and Joni Mitchell. He has written scores
for movies and even the themes for two 1970s TV shows, ``Starsky and
Hutch'' and ``The Streets of San Francisco.''
   In between such projects, Scott, sometimes with his ever-changing
band the L.A. Express, has found time to make solo records of
lightweight jazz-rock fusion, meticulously produced and somewhat
devoid of any spark.
   The same holds true for ``Flashpoint.''
   The opening cut, ``Get a Grip,'' sets the tone for the album,
with its uptempo melody, overdubbed saxophone solos and shifty
rhythm. Scott's penchant for overdubbing tenor and alto saxes
creates a fuller sound but prevents him from straying too far from
the melody, robbing his solos of spontaneity.
   ``Lost in Love'' and ``Night Drifter'' are both moodier, slower
pieces that showcase Scott's tenor sax runs, while the title cut is
the most adventurous, with its synthesizer-saxophone harmony and
machine-like rhythm.
   Scott is a talented composer, producer and sideman, but as a solo
act he shows little imagination. His music, while pleasant enough,
begs for something to set it apart from the crowd.

   ``T-Shirt'' (Epic) _ The Crickets
   
   The first album in years by The Crickets is an unexpected little
pleasure, especially if it is approached without lofty expectations.
   Former Buddy Holly sidekicks J.I. Allison and Joe Mauldin are
joined on ``T-Shirt'' by singer-guitarist Gordon Payne for 10 songs
that, happily, don't lapse into sentimental reminiscences or futile
attempts to recreate the late rocker's magic.
   They do a good job playing breezy, good-time rock 'n' roll, the
sort of thing Holly might be doing today had he lived (and stopped
progressing musically) past 1959.
   It's unpretentious, fun and instantly likeable.
   One song rises above the rest _ the Paul McCartney-produced title
cut. It's the most overtly Holly-esque song here, with an
irresistible hand-clapping, guitar-strumming chorus: ``Don't tell me
that love hurts-I read the book, I saw the movie, got the T-shirt.''
   The Crickets also poke fun at themselves in the bouncy ``Three
Piece,'' noting how many musicians have been in and out of the band
since Holly split from the group shortly before his death.
   There have been, they sing, ``more Crickets than a dog's got
fleas, but we've cut it down to a three-piece.'' Then, noting the
advantages of a smaller group, ``The overhead's down and the money's
increased.''
   Such high points are not sustained over the entire album, though,
and the sappy ballad ``The Weekend'' and the unnecessary car song
``Cruise in It'' threaten to drag things down.
   But The Crickets make up in spirit for the few weak spots, making
``T-Shirt'' a well-fitting, comfortable record.

   ``More Than Friends'' (Jive) _ Jonathan Butler
   
   Jonathan Butler is the kind of guy we all used to hate in school.
Butler is handsome, sings well, plays a mean guitar and writes
catchy songs. He probably played on the football team, too.
   Butler puts his musical talents to good use on ``More Than
Friends,'' a collection of 10 tunes that contains few clinkers. The
record is mostly pop, part r&amp;b and a little bit of jazz. Because of
Butler's scat singing and the way he rips through acoustic guitar
licks, his sound is a bit reminiscent of George Benson.
   The opening cuts, ``There's One Born Every Minute (I'm a Sucker
for You)'' and ``Breaking Away,'' both swing and swagger with a
smile. The mood remains upbeat the rest of the way, with other
highlights including the instrumentals ``Take Me Home'' and
``Sekona.'' Butler even turns a few neat phrases, as seen on ``She's
a Teaser'':
   ``She'll call you up at 2 a.m., says she wants some company; I
tell you this from experience, the only thing you'll do all night is
watch TV.''
   It's some consolation that Butler occasionally has trouble with
girls.

<HEAD>Star Watch: The Shy Tom Selleck</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom Selleck shy?
   ``I think so, yeah,'' he says. ``I was terribly shy all my life,
not just as a kid. An awful lot of actors I know are shy.''
   That may help explain part of his enduring appeal, first in eight
seasons and eternal reruns as television's ``Magnum, P.I.'' and now
as the big-screen star of ``Three Men and a Baby'' and the current
``Her Alibi.'' He may display the outward appearance of a movie
hero, but there's an underlying uncertainty that beguiles women and
reassures men.
   Selleck's candid appraisal:
   ``I don't see myself as others do. People tell me, `You're
willing to play with your macho image, you're willing to play with
that.' Well, I never tried to project a macho image.
   ``In fact, I'm six feet, four inches tall. I've been taller than
most people most of my adult life. I see no reason to run around
trying to intimidate people with that. I've always kind of gone the
other way.''
   Such an approach seems to be the way for his film career to go.
During hiatus time of the early ``Magnum,'' he starred in three
films of the heroic mode, ``High Road to China,'' ``Lassiter,''
``Runaway.'' All were disappointments, though not the dismal
failures some critics claimed.
   ``Three Men and a Baby'' and to a lesser extent, ``Her Alibi,''
indicate that the key to Selleck's film success lies in stressing
his fallibilities. The new film casts him as a mystery writer who
becomes involved in a spy plot involving a Romanian exchange
student, played by model Paulina Porizkova.
   ``It's a change of pace for me,'' Selleck remarked. ``There's a
lot more physical comedy in this picture, and yet as silly as the
picture gets, it's the kind of comedy which I think you have to play
absolutely for real.''
   The director is Bruce Beresford, the Australian who has made
``Tender Mercies,'' ``Crimes of the Heart'' and other films in this
country.
   ``Bruce seems to be able to translate the American ethic on
film,'' Selleck observed. ``I've gotten to know many Aussies in
Hawaii, and I think there's a certain kinship between the two
countries. Maybe it's because we're both kind of young civilizations
in the historical context.''
   Selleck has completed the transition to films with a hefty
salary. His reported fee for ``Her Alibi'' is $4 million. Has this
resulted from some grand plan on his part?
   ``I don't think I had the ability to be that calculated,'' he
said. ``I had some instincts, and one picture led to a certain kind
of logic for what I would do next.
   ``I was concerned about it. I was pretty defensive about pictures
I had done. My stock was pretty good all during `Magnum,' but it
wasn't perceived that way with my first three pictures. I think it's
because they weren't successful in the same magnitude as `Magnum.'
   ``The offers kept getting better all during `Magnum,' but nobody
knew it,'' he said. ``The questions I was asked changed even before
`Three Men and a Baby' started making money. The questions implied
that I had successfully made the transition.''
   Growing up shy in the San Fernando Valley, Selleck never had a
desire to become an actor.
   ``I never did a school play, I never did anything,'' he declared.
``I got into (acting) because I grew up in the town where the
business centered, and somebody said, `You ought to try commercials.'
   ``I thought you could make money at it, good money for very
little work. After I tried it, I liked it.''
   Cigarette commercials and ads led to a contract at 20th Century
Fox, where he learned his craft. He freelanced in television, then
landed at Universal, which cast him in seven failed pilots until
``Magnum, P.I.''
   Selleck remains at Universal, occupying a suite of offices with
his production company. Among his projects is producing a new
television series for his friend Burt Reynolds.
   Last Dec. 16, Selleck's wife, actress-singer Jillie Mack, gave
birth to their first child, Hannah. The 44-year-old father remains
exultant.
   ``Hannah is great,'' he said. ``The main reason I thought it was
time to end `Magnum' was that I felt my priorities were a little
off. While I thought it was well worth making the sacrifice of
putting work ahead of family for an opportunity like `Magnum,' I'd
been doing it long enough.''
   To take care of the new family, he bought a 60-acre ranch in the
San Fernando Valley as well as a home closer to town, in Mandeville
Canyon.
   Will there be a ``Three Men and a Baby II''?
   ``Yeah. And they (Disney) postponed it, which to me is a real
vote of confidence. It's encouraging, because I think a lot of
studios would consider their investors and say, `Why delay it? You
could do anything and make a hundred million dollars.'
   ``I think Disney truly does feel this is kind of a benchmark for
them, a touchstone, and they want to take care of it,'' he said.
``So when they said, `We're willing to forego next Christmas to make
the script better,' it says to me they want to make a sequel that's

   Ask Ned Livingston what he does and even he has
a hard time deciding what it is, exactly.
   There's what he calls ``this stuff'': the chairs and other
furniture he whittles in fluid designs, which sell for big money in
fashionable art galleries in New York and Los Angeles.
   Then there's what he calls ``the land'': the old Gerber Ranch,
which he and his wife inherited with its pastures to irrigate, and
timber to manage.
   And there are the fish in the pond in front of the house, which
need a handful of chopped liver now and then; the red-legged
partridges, which he released into Miller Creek Canyon; and the
Klamath County Planning Commission, on which he serves as a member.
   ``You are talking to a guy who is not particularly sure what
woman he is married to, the furniture or the land,'' Livingston said
one winter's day at his home, which he built in a meadow surrounded
by ponderosa pine and juniper at the foot of Horsefly Mountain.
``And I'm not particularly worried about it.''
   Livingston and his wife, Marilyn, were both born and raised in
this high desert country east of the Cascade Range: Ned in Klamath
Falls and Marilyn on the old Gerber Ranch, which is a good 1{-hour
drive from the city.
   ``We came back here (in the 1950s) after college for a year or
two,'' he said. ``Then we went to the big city looking for a big
architecture job.
   ``If I had proceeded professionally, I would have stayed in San
Francisco. But we kept coming back and coming back. Finally, I said,
`Let's quit looking for ourselves and do what we really want to
do.'''
   So they moved back to the ranch. Livingston started gluing up
pieces of oak and walnut and using a horseshoe rasp to shape
free-flowing chairs, cradles, music stands, benches, coat racks,
library ladders and bar stools. The ones he didn't sell stayed home.
It has taken some years to get six chairs around the dining table.
   ``In the '60s I was really hot,'' Livingston recalled. ``I was
going to burn up the art world with these things. I had a piece in
the Renwick Gallery at the Smithsonian. The point is I had stuff
around the country. Maybe I would sell a piece here, a piece there.
   ``It hasn't built into the kind of thing where I didn't need to
worry about a monthly income. Then comes the estate breaking up. I
had been involved in the operation of this ranch. So the last four
or five years I've let this stuff slide. I've worked on irrigating
the south 40 or thinning timber.
   ``The land is definitely a conflict with this other stuff,'' he
said. ``Most people aren't so fortunate to have that problem. It
would be stupid of me to neglect it.''
   Livingston proudly recites the history of his land, which was
assembled by cattlemen _ first Horsefly Wilson and later the Gerber
brothers _ in the late 1800s out of small homesteads too poor to
support a family. Marilyn Livingston drives about 15 miles on a
cinder road to get to the little logging community of Bly, where she
teaches school. They lease the pastureland for grazing and Ned is
working on expanding the irrigation network to produce more summer
grass.
   He recently cruised several hundred acres of timber. Where the
logging outfit wanted to cut all the mature timber, Livingston left
enough of the big trees to generate new ones and maintain the
diversity of the forest.
   With 20 inches of snow on the ground, he's been able to get back
to what he calls the wood whittling.
   ``My furniture tries to conform to the shape of the human body.
It ends up kind of sculptural.
   ``One of the hardest things to make is a chair. Vitruvius (a
Roman architect from the first century, B.C.) said a building should
accomplish three things: firmness, commodity and delight. What is a
chair but the same three things?''
   Livingston has been working on improving his dining chair, which
he considers his signature work and abstractly calls to mind the
sandhill cranes that breed nearby. ``The bad thing is the scoop seat
makes it hard to get in and out of,'' he says.
   The sketch of his latest idea is in the middle of his notes from
a meeting where a state planning official explained some new
regulations aimed at stopping the fragmentation of Oregon's farm and
forest lands.
   In his shop, an early chair, a prototype for a collasible
cathouse, jigs, horse collars, bicycles and a small hydroplane one
of his two sons built hang from the ceiling. On a work bench, a
portable radio propped on a milk can plays classical music.
   At another bench, Livingston is free-forming a curved lamination
that will form the splayed legs and support the seat of the new
dining chair.
   ``This is the fun part about designing by the seat of your
pants,'' he said. ``You think you know where you're going, but you
don't.
   ``If you look at it, you're looking at the bone and sinew and all
the rest of the mass is subtracted. I get more of a feel for what
makes that baby work.''
   Livingston was intrigued by a suggestion some time back to make
the chairs out of injection-molded plastic.
   ``The way I work with the material, I tend to make the wood into
a plastic material,'' he said. ``You look at a tree limb sticking
out from the trunk, and if that isn't a plastic process, I don't
know what is. Wood is basically a bunch of bendable fibers.
   ``It would be easier to pour the stuff into an injection mold and
spit out one of these chairs every two hours in any color you want
and walk laughing to the bank.''
   Though it takes 40 hours to whittle one of his dining chairs out
of wood, Livingston finds it more friendly than plastic.
   ``It has an inherent warmth about it that's hard to duplicate in
plastic,'' he said. ``Even a warm color in plastic is cold. Whereas
wood, you want to touch wood, feel it.''

<BYLINE>Music Makers: Country-Blues Band Jives on Melancholy ^By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The words like ethereal, despairing, melancholy
and dolorous that mark reviews of the Cowboy Junkies tip off right
away that this is not your average pop group.
   So, learning that vocalist Margo Timmins' apartment on one of
Toronto's trendiest streets is unmarked and hidden away behind some
offices should not come as a surprise.
   ``That's the way I like it,'' she says with a bit of a grimace
when told the address for the scheduled interview was hard to find.
   The publicity machine of the pop music industry is gearing up to
promote one of its unlikeliest recent hits, the Cowboy Junkies'
``The Trinity Session'' recorded in one day in November 1987 at the
Church of the Holy Trinity in Toronto.
   The album, whose production cost was $250, includes eerily
stretched out, sparse versions of Hank Williams' ``I'm So Lonesome I
Could Cry,'' Lou Reed's ``Sweet Jane'' and Patsy Cline's ``Walking
After Midnight.''
   Some haunting originals are included as well, such as ``Misguided
Angel'' and ``200 More Miles.''
   ``In the last two months I've done more interviews than most
people do in a lifetime,'' the 28-year-old Timmins said, taking a
break from packing for a long tour that includes a New York stop to
perform on ``Saturday Night Live.''
   ``It's just a matter of getting used to it,'' she said, with a
laugh. ``It's like everything ... everything's happened so quickly.''
   Her 29-year-old brother, Michael, and his childhood friend Alan
Anton came back to Toronto after stints performing to little acclaim
for a few years in New York and England. They started rehearsing in
the garage of Timmins' younger brother, Pete, then brought him into
the band to play drums. Margo joined to do vocals.
   But not only didn't she see herself as a singer, she also was
concerned that a band with too many family relationships could cause
strains. ``It's worked out really well. Mike and I really work well
together,'' she said.
   Settled in for a conversation with EmmyLou Harris' new record
playing in the background, she said, ``It's an honor for me to sing
his songs.''
   The band has been together since 1985 but publicity swelled last
year after RCA released ``The Trinity Session'' in the United States
and enthusiastic reviews started appearing.
   The music generally is pegged as country-blues with a touch of
the Velvet Underground.
   The Los Angeles Times' critics poll found it the best pop album
of 1988, beating out U2, Tracy Chapman and Prince. Times' critic
Robert Hilburn called them ``mesmerizing.''
   Michael Timmins phones to check if the interview is running
smoothly or if an explanation of how the Cowboy Junkies picked their
name is needed, but Margo tells him it's already been discussed.
   She said the name was chosen because an independent band,
especially in Canada with its smaller market, needs anything it can
get to attract attention. ``I think it did us well at that level,''
she said. ``It's still generating a lot of interest.''
   With the addition of three sidemen, the band has swelled to seven.
   There's been some local sniping about the Cowboy Junkies' success
outside of Canada, where record companies generally have limited
slots that go to bands aimed squarely at the mainstream.
   ``Yes, I think that's really unfortunate that you have to go
across the border to get recognized, but you have to be realistic,''
said Timmins, her shock of light hair pulled back. ``I am in the
American market. It's the facts of life _ but no one's going to get
me to say that I'm an American band.
   ``Whatever makes us Canadian is in our music. I don't think we're
flag raisers. We're much more laid back.''
   She also has limited patience for those who criticize their music.
   ``If you like it, fine. If you don't _ don't listen,'' she said.
``I can't really put my finger on what we're doing. It surprises us;
a lot of it is spontaneous.''
   The slow pacing of the music and the band's quiet demeanor during
performances can take some getting used to.
   ``It's definitely on some weird edge and there's the danger of
falling off at some point,'' Michael said in an interview with the
Canadian Press news agency. ``We've never attempted to be a country
band or a rock band. We just play and this melancholy sound comes
out.''
   ``We've just found when we slow a song down it starts to make
more sense,'' Margo said. ``It leaves us much more room for
interpretation.''
   ``It's a big challenge to play slow. You're asking a lot of the
audience,'' she said. ``There's also the risk that when it doesn't
work, it's dull. And I'm not ashamed to admit it.''
   The decision to record in a church was made for the sound, and
Timmins noted that the ``The Trinity Session'' was centered
consciously around the vocals.
   ``We knew that the church would bring out the best of my voice,''
she said, laughing. ``Singing in a church does a lot for your
vocals.''
   The next album will also be recorded live over a period of time
in different locations.
   ``When you record live, the room is an acoustical instrument,''
she said.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Floyd Cramer Learned Well</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a youngster, aspiring musician Floyd
Cramer would agitate his piano teachers by playing ``by ear'' rather
than learning to read music.
   Despite their protests, Cramer became the best piano player in
the small sawmill town of Huttig, Ark. In fact, he went on to become
one of the most famous in the world.
   In a career spanning more than 30 years, he played on many of
Elvis Presley's records and movie soundtracks. His million-selling
hit ``Last Date'' became a piano standard. He even developed a piano
technique often referred to as the ``slip note'' style.
   Today, he's seen often in TV ads, selling such albums as ``World
Famous Love Songs'' and ``Treasury of Favorites.'' He's sold more
than a million copies through TV marketing alone in the past three
years.
   Prior to making records for sale by television, he spent 23 years
with RCA Records and joined guitarist Chet Atkins and sax player
Boots Randolph as Nashville's best-known instrumentalists. He's
recorded more than 50 albums.
   All this came from a bashful kid who disliked practicing,
exasperated his teachers and still admits that classical music is
beyond his limits.
   He still doesn't like to practice. He even avoids the term,
preferring to call it ``playing'': ``Some call it practice. I call
it play. That's because I enjoy it; practice I don't enjoy.''
   Regardless of what he calls it, Cramer has been stroking the
ivories since his parents bought a spinet piano when he was 5.
   ``I had some lessons, but I just wasn't interested,'' the
55-year-old musician recalled. ``It was the confinement, I guess.
But I enjoyed playing by ear. The teachers got upset because I
learned it by ear.''
   By age 15 he was playing and traveling with country music stars
such as Webb Pierce and Faron Young. In his early 20s, he was
playing piano on a flatbed truck and in school auditoriums on a tour
of Texas featuring a young singer named Elvis Presley.
   Cramer later played on most of Presley's records and in his
movies including ``Blue Hawaii,'' ``Girl Happy'' and ``Roustabout.''
   ``He was always nice to us,'' Cramer said about the recording
sessions. ``He enjoyed the musicians and felt very comfortable.''
   Cramer has 6- and 9-year-old granddaughters who have become
Presley fans.
   His ``Last Date'' in 1960 is still heard on radio stations
playing ``golden oldies,'' and the tune has been learned by
thousands of young piano students who weren't even born when Cramer
wrote and recorded it.
   ``It's a simple melody,'' he said. ``It's good exercise for both
hands. You are playing solid left hand patterns and a dominant
melody with the right hand. It's different and fresh to most piano
students.''
   The song has found its way into American ceremonies, also.
   ``I've had people tell me they'd like to have it played at their
funeral,'' Cramer said. ``And others say they'd like to have it
played at their wedding. About two weeks ago, someone said it was
played at the altar call at church. So it means different things to
different people.''
   In 1984, at the request of Michael Jackson, Cramer played piano
at a birthday party for Jackson's mother because he is her favorite
musical performer.
   Cramer quoted the young rock superstar as saying he'd been
listening to ``Last Date'' all his life and that Cramer's music had
influenced his style.
   ``The song has been very good to me; I'm proud of it; I play it
every chance I get,'' Cramer said.
   His style of playing is slurring, or bending, notes. It's sort of
a near-miss on the keyboard. ``They call it everything,'' he said.
``Some call it a mistake with a quick recovery.''
   He describes his own gift as ``being able to play with feeling,
to interpret a mood of a song.'' But he acknowledges some
shortcomings.
   ``I'm not good at classical. Some I wouldn't dare try because
it's beyond me. Some would say it's beyond my capabilities,
technique or training or my mind of comprehension. But I know my
limits, that's the key.''
   Nevertheless, he still learns just about every time he sits down
at one of the three pianos he owns.
   ``I learn something all the time: a different way to play certain
things. Different songs and melodies contribute to that.''
   Does he sing?
   ``Just for my own amusement,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scientists Study Way to Pinpoint Pollution Sources in Acid Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists are studying a way to ``tag''
smokestack pollutants much the way biologists tag birds and animals
as part of research into pinpointing the chemicals that contribute
to acid rain.
   In tests begun last summer, W. Robert Kelly of the National
Institute of Standards and Technology and University of Maryland
aerosol chemist John Ondov injected an enriched, or strengthened,
isotope of the metal neodymium into smoke from a coal-burning power
plant in northern Virginia.
   Analysis showed that air filters at sampling sites in an arc from
Bethesda to Landover ``detected the release of the enriched isotope
20 kilometers from the power plant,'' Kelly said. The experiment
proved ``we can inject it into the smokestack, take samples into the
lab and detect the effect.''
   Kelly and Ondov are seeking an Environmental Protection Agency
grant to study whether the particle tracing will work over longer
distances. The EPA is testing isotope tracers in diesel fuel used by
public vehicles in Roanoke, Va.
   Plants could be injected with different isotopes to help track
the pollutants each one produces. Imagine each isotope is a colored
ping pong ball, Kelly said. ``You can count the relative numbers of
blue, green and red balls, and say, `Aha! The plant in Town A, even
though it is further away, is the source of 10 times the number of
balls as the plant right next door.'''
   Acid rain is formed from sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
released by the combustion of coal and other fossil fuels. In
combination with water, they form nitric acid gas and sulfuric acid
droplets, which dissolve in rain.
   The research was funded by the utility industry's Electric Power
Research Institute and Maryland's Power Plant Topical Research
Program.

<DATELINE>WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Nuclear Agency
hopes to start testing the durability of military equipment by 1994
in a $74 million device that will simulate the heat and shock waves
of a nuclear blast.
   The blast simulator will consist of a 894-foot-long tube, 66 feet
in diameter, connected to a test chamber big enough to hold a tank
or helicopter, said spokeswoman Cheri Abdelnour. The other end of
the tube will be fitted with nine high-pressure valves that will
create a shock wave of compressed nitrogen; torches burning oxygen
and aluminum powder will create short blasts of heat.
   The device will be able to bombard objects with energy as strong
as 600 kiloton blasts _ 30 times the power of the bomb that
devastated Hiroshima.
   Construction could start in two years, at a site on the northwest
corner of the missile range chosen after a year-long study,
Abdelnour said.

<HEAD>Archaeologist Disputes Popular View of Mammoth Hunts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CASPER, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An archaeologist who went to Africa to test
stone tools used 11,000 years ago in North America says modern
painting of mammoth hunts are based largely on misconceptions about
the hunters' abilities.
   Paintings, dioramas and even textbooks often show mammoths up to
their tusks in swamps with hunters rushing around, waving spears and
yelling, said George Frison, ``and usually somebody being trampled
to death.''
   This almost certainly was not the typical hunting method of
Clovis cultures that lived in the Wyoming area, said the University
of Wyoming professor.
   The short spears and lances found at Clovis-period sites could be
used to kill and skin mammoths, Frison said, but the hunters
probably went after young, stray animals to avoid facing charging
herds of the 15,000-pound creatures.
   Assuming that mammoths had a social structure similar to African
elephants, a Clovis-culture hunt would probably proceed very
differently. Elephants have a strong family structure in which the
matriarch is protector of the herd. At the sign of danger, the
matriarch will charge, six or more tons of enraged elephant bearing
down on the hunter, armed only with a stone-tipped spear. ``You're
not going to down a charging matriarch with Clovis weaponry,''
Frison said.
   Consequently, the only way Clovis hunters could routinely have
killed mammoths would be by going after younger animals away from
the herd. Hunters would have worked in pairs, one distracting the
animal without threatening it, and the other sneaking up on it to
deliver the fatal wound, he said. They would then hide until the
animal died and the herd left.
   Frison, testing his theories on dead elephants in Zimbabwe, found
that Clovis spears and lances could pierce an elephant's hide from
60 feet. A spear that pierced a mammoth's lungs would probably kill
it within minutes, while one that pierced the stomach would take
hours to days to cause death, he said.
   Frison said no one can really know the Clovis techniques but that
this is more likely than the screaming tribal charge often depicted
by artists.
   ``Clovis really represents the development of true hunting
weaponry,'' Frison said, a conclusion he admits is controversial
among those who studied early humans in Europe, Africa and Asia.
``If you're really talking about the kind of hunting that one or two
hunters bring down a mammoth,'' he said, ``it developed in the new
world.''

<HEAD>Director Wants To Phase Out Leper Colony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARVILLE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leprosy treatment has come a long way since
the days when victims of the disfiguring disease were forcibly
detained here.
   Hansen's Disease can be treated almost exclusively on an
outpatient basis now, and the director of the only leper colony in
the continental United States plans to phase out the antiquated
facility set up when victims were outcasts.
   But Dr. John C. Duffy doesn't intend for the work of the Gillis
W. Long Hansen's Disease Research Center to be lost as its buildings
age along with its 140 permanent patients, who average 65 years old.
One outgrowth of leprosy research has led to help for diabetics, for
example.
   ``Our research is outstanding, but our physical plant is a
disaster,'' said Duffy, citing an Office of Management and Budget
study. He wants to move the center's acute care, research and
education functions, to Baton Rouge.
   The colony was opened in 1894 on an old plantation when the state
ferried five men and two women up the Mississippi River under cover
of night from a New Orleans ``pest house.'' The federal government
took control in 1921 and as many as 500 permanent residents were
housed during the 1930s. Most of the 330-acre complex of white,
plantation-style buildings connected by a maze of enclosed walkways
was built during the '30s by the Works Progress Administration.
   ``It was a very different patient population,'' Duffy said.
``They were young, non-immigrant and they were mainstream
Americans.''
   Leprosy victims were arrested and forcibly detained here until
after World War II, when drugs were found that stopped the
contagiousness and progression of the disease. Over time, fewer
patients took up permanent residence.
   The center, which has treated nearly 3,000 patients, survived
when the Reagan administration in 1984 closed seven other hospitals
operated by the U.S. Public Health Service. The late U.S. Rep.
Gillis W. Long spearheaded a drive to save it, but federal officials
suggested research be done by either the Centers for Disease Control
or the National Institutes of Health.
   Leprosy, a bacterial infection, attacks the skin, flesh and
nerves, and is characterized by scabs, deformities and eventual loss
of sensation. There are an estimated 6,000 to 10,000 U.S. cases, but
up to 20 million worldwide.
   ``We will continue to receive men, women and children with this
disease. It's not an excludable disease,'' Duffy said. ``You can
have it and you can come into this country. Because the incubation
period is sometimes six to eight years somebody can come into this
country with no idea they have the disease.''
   Research needs to continue at the center, he said. For one thing,
the work takes hundreds of armadillos, the only nonhuman animal that
gets the disease, and ``there is no room at either CDC or NIH for
the armadillos.''
   Also, ``All the experts are here. They are not in Bethesda or
Atlanta.''
   The center could take rental space in Baton Rouge without
increasing its $18 million annual budget, he said.
   All major advances in leprosy treatment _ drugs,
armadillo-related discoveries and two generations of vaccines with
limited effectiveness _ came from Carville's researchers, said
Duffy, who fears that research would be downgraded if it was moved
to another agency.
   ``It's one of the paradoxes of the disease that as far as
scientists are concerned, their interest is almost always elsewhere
than on this disease,'' he said. ``It's not the kind of research for
which you will win a Nobel Prize.
   ``As a result, the scientific community has paid scant or little
attention to this disease. There is this group that has almost, in a
sense, religiously dedicated their lives to this disease, that are
centered here.''
   But even the worst cases discovered today can be handled through
one of 11 regional treatment centers or by private doctors. For
example, a victim whose disease progressed while he was confined in
a Cambodian prison is undergoing outpatient treatment in San
Francisco.
   Thalidomide, notorious for causing congenital birth defects, is
one drug that controls the disease. The drug of choice is
diaminodiphenyl sulfone, first used in leprosy treatment in 1941 by
Dr. Guy Faget at Carville. Two other drugs _ Rifampin and
Clofazamins _ have been tested successfully in recent years, and
research continues because the bacteria is becoming resistant to
sulfone drugs.
   New admissions to Carville are mostly patients with reactions to
the drug treatment or have diagnostic problems. After a few weeks,
they go home.
   Research into the loss of feeling in hands and now is being put
to work for diabetics, who often require amputations after foot
injuries stemming from the lack of sensation in their extremities.
   About 500 diabetics have been treated here for foot problems such
as ulcers with special casts that allow healing and mobility, said
Dr. Charles Patout, chief of rehabilitation. ``The techniques we've
developed here could reduce the number of amputations among
diabetics, about 50,000 a year, by 90 percent.''
   Of the diabetics treated at Carville, only two have undergone
amputations.
   Duffy would like to see more diabetics take advantage of
Carville, but he admits the stigma of leprosy may keep many patients
from coming to the center. That is another reason to move treatment
facilities to Baton Rouge.
   As far as the permanent colony residents are concerned, the
federal government should continue to care for them at Carville, he
said, especially because of the traditional stigma. ``Private
nursing homes wouldn't take them. What I would like to do is leave
that population right here and provide them all the resources of a
long-term care facility.''

   Barbara Blodgett was in a coma when she gave
birth to a healthy eight-pound son in December. Nancy Klein remains
in a coma after her husband won the right to abort her 18-week-old
fetus earlier this month.
   The number of pregnant women who go into a coma each year is
small, doctors say, and many questions remain about how a pregnant
woman's coma affects the fetus and how a fetus affects the recovery
of its comatose mother.
   That's why Simon Alan Blodgett's birth was so unique _ and why
Martin Klein fought for an abortion, hoping to improve his wife's
chances of recovery.
   There are no accurate statistics, but three large U.S. trauma
centers report a total of about 20 cases of pregnant women in comas
over two years. Doctors at all three hospitals agreed that in most
cases the coma ends and the woman goes home and has a healthy baby.
With severe head injuries most fetuses abort naturally, are aborted
to help the mother, or die in childbirth.
   ``There is a very high incidence of spontaneous abortion that
occurs in these cases,'' said Dr. Robert White of Case Western
Reserve University, and director of neurosurgery at Metropolitan
General Hospital in Cleveland, one of the largest trauma centers.
``Out of this group they either spontaneously abort or after a few
weeks they go home to deliver.''
   In perhaps one comatose patient a year is a birth even attempted,
and White said he could not remember such a birth ever being
successful at the hospital. The mother often begins to ``unravel
medically,'' forcing doctors to try for a premature birth, he said.
``There is not a lot of research in this.''
   Doctors at University Hospital in Seattle said Simon Blodget's
birth was only the fourth successful delivery from a comatose mother
they could document in medical history.
   Dr. Madhura Patel of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who
specializes in treating head injuries to pregnant women, has seen
only seven such cases in two years. Several patients recovered with
fetuses intact but in one case of an unmarried teen-ager who was
five weeks pregnant, the girl's father ordered an abortion his
daughter was unlikely ever to be able to care for an infant.
   ``The mother subsequently woke up from the coma but continues to
be impaired. She has no memory of the fact of ever being pregnant.''
   Blodgett, 24, of Yakima, suffered brain stem injury in a traffic
accident June 30, when she was three months pregnant. After initial
reluctance, family members say, a Seattle hospital accepted her.
Doctors held out little hope of improvement, but shortly after
Simon's Dec. 9 birth, Blodgett began regaining consciousness and was
well enough to return home in mid-January.
   She has made steady progress and has limited use of one arm,
allowing her to cradle her newborn and point to letters to spell
words. Last week she began intensive rehabilitation at St.
Elizabeth's Medical Center in Yakima, and, in a unique challenge,
has vowed to walk and talk before her newborn.
   No one knows exactly why Blodgett came around after the birth,
although one doctor speculated that hormonal changes triggered a
return to consciousness.
   Family members feel she was conserving her energy for the fetus.
``After she had the baby, it was a signal for her to go,'' husband
David Blodgett Jr. said. ``After she had the baby she concentrated
more on herself.''
   The family ``never had a lot of hope from any doctor,'' Blodgett
said, but always had faith she would recover. ``We spent so much
time with her that you could see the small things she did.''
   Martin Klein had no such hopes. He successfully battled
anti-abortion activists to win a court order allowing the abortion,
which doctors said could aid his wife's recovery. Mrs. Klein, 32,
remains in a coma at North Shore University Hospital on New York's
Long Island.

   When most people think of blimps,
they imagine gently floating giant balloons advertising everything
from tires to film to soft drinks.
   The Department of Defense has another picture: protector of
warships, able to remain nearly invisible to radar while providing
early warning of approaching enemy aircraft.
   Blimps played this role in World War II but the Navy abandoned
its airships as outdated in the early 1960s.
   Now, the Pentagon has ordered construction of a 425-foot-long
blimp that will be the largest non-rigid airship ever built, more
than twice as long as a conventional blimp. The blimp will be
equipped with powerful radar and will be capable of patrolling for
several days without refueling. It will fly as high as 10,000 feet
at speeds up to 80 knots, about 92 miles per hour.
   ``Everyone has been doing these paper studies of the airships
for, I don't know, ever since they stopped using airships,'' said
Ron Hochstetler of Airship Industries, a British blimp maker that is
building the military blimp in a joint venture with Westinghouse
Electric Corp.
   ``The only way anyone will really be able to say whether or not a
wide, modern-technology airship would have benefits in the modern
Navy is to actually have one that size that you go up and fly on and
try out your ideas with.
   ``So many of the ideas are predicated on installing equipment
that never existed before in the old airship days,' Hochstetler
said. ``We've all kind of new technologies that conceivably can make
them much more usable.''
   Airship Industries sees a new generation of blimps being used not
just for military surveillance, but for spotting drug-smuggling
planes, monitoring ocean pollution and taking tourists on
sightseeing flights.
   ``Surveillance is certainly one that they are pushing very hard.
It's a machine that's very good at that job. It's good at
advertising. It's very good at people going for a ride to see the
scenery,'' said Capt. Billy E. Richardson, manager of Airship's
facility here.
   ``To get from A to B, no, it's not the machine for it.''
   Airship Industries, the world's largest manufacturer of blimps,
has built 13 since it was formed about eight years ago, said Mary
Lee Dickson, assistant marketing manager in New York. Among them are
two blimps sold to South Korea and Tokyo for police surveillance.
   The $168 million prototype of the military blimp should be ready
to fly by 1993, Hochstetler said.
   A model of its three-deck gondola is under construction in a
former Navy blimp hangar built during World War II outside Elizabeth
City. The compartment underneath the blimp will contain sleeping
berths for a crew of 12 to 15, an exercise room, refueling gear and
other equipment.
   The blimp will be able to move up or down, forward or backward,
with the help of computerized flight controls and vectored-thrust
engines equipped with propellers that can be swiveled to any up or
down angle.
   The blimp's plastic-lined fabric hull will be filled with helium,
which is non-flammable. The rigid dirigibles of the 1930s, like the
ill-fated Hindenburg, were filled with explosive hydrogen.
   If the blimp is fired upon, it would remain afloat because it has
low internal pressure and the gas would escape slowly. Even with a
severe helium loss, the blimp would slowly descend rather than
crash, Airship said.
   Airship officials believe blimps' potential has barely been
explored, and say that the prototype should lead to other military
and commercial uses.
   ``The airship can do things no other aircraft can,'' Hochstetler
said. ``We've just scratched the surface.''

<HEAD>Director Wants To Phase Out Leper Colony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARVILLE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leprosy treatment has come a long way since
the days when victims of the disfiguring disease were forcibly
detained here.
   Hansen's Disease can be treated almost exclusively on an
outpatient basis now, and the director of the only leper colony in
the continental United States plans to phase out the antiquated
facility set up when victims were outcasts.
   But Dr. John C. Duffy doesn't intend for the work of the Gillis
W. Long Hansen's Disease Research Center to be lost as its buildings
age along with its 140 permanent patients, who average 65 years old.
One outgrowth of leprosy research has led to help for diabetics, for
example.
   ``Our research is outstanding, but our physical plant is a
disaster,'' said Duffy, citing an Office of Management and Budget
study. He wants to move the center's acute care, research and
education functions, to Baton Rouge.
   The center, which has treated nearly 3,000 patients, survived
when the Reagan administration in 1984 closed seven other hospitals
operated by the U.S. Public Health Service. The late U.S. Rep.
Gillis W. Long spearheaded a drive to save it, but federal officials
suggested research be done by either the Centers for Disease Control
or the National Institutes of Health.
   Research needs to continue at the center, Duffy said. ``All the
experts are here. They are not in Bethesda or Atlanta.''
   Leprosy, a bacterial infection, attacks the skin, flesh and
nerves, and is characterized by scabs, deformities and eventual loss
of sensation. There are an estimated 6,000 to 10,000 U.S. cases, but
up to 20 million worldwide.
   All major advances in leprosy treatment came at Carville, said
Duffy, who fears that research would be downgraded if it was moved
to another agency.
   Research into the loss of feeling in hands and feet now is being
put to work for diabetics, who often require amputations after foot
injuries stemming from the lack of sensation in their extremities.

   Would black strawberries on your shortcake whet your appetite?
How about some blue sweet corn? And would Peter Piper pick a peck of
purple peppers?
   These colored vegetables and others are available or in the
process of being developed. Would they lure you to the market, at
least to try some?
   The ``Black Beauty'' strawberry _ known thus far as NY1593 _ is
an advanced selection of strawberry characterized by a deep
purplish-red color that is almost black.
   ``I hesitate to recommend it as a table variety because I don't
think people are ready to accept strawberries that aren't red,''
says John C. Sanford of Cornell University's New York State
Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, N.Y., who is working on
the berry. He believes the berry may be valuable as a natural
coloring agent for processed foods, ice cream, yogurt and frozen
fruit bars.
   The black berry is large, attractive, relatively firm and has a
pleasant flavor, says Sanford, who ranked it about the same in
nutritional value as the traditional red berry.
   Blue corn won't turn your teeth blue, as some folks might fear,
says Rose Edwards of Albuquerque, N.M., who founded Blue Corn
Connection in 1985. He produces blue corn popcorn, pancake, muffin
and waffle mixes, blue corn cnips and blue corn meal ground coarse,
medium and fine.
   Edwards says people are intrigued by a blue product and ``most of
our products come across a little sweeter.'' He says about 15,000
acres of blue corn are being farmed presently, largely in the
Southwest.
   There are quite a few purple vegetables. Purple cabbages
alternated with green ones in the garden are attractive. There are
glossy purple eggplants named Black Magic.
   Purple cauliflower actually looks more like broccoli but with
smaller buds. Varieties include Purple-Head and Royal Purple. Purple
cauliflowers generally become green when cooked.
   Seed companies also are offering blue potatoes, white eggplant,
yellow beets and burgundy beans.
   Scalloped, or patty-pan squash, normally seen in white or pale
green, is now available in a dark green variety called
``Scallopini.''
   One potato variety named ``All Blue,'' has both blue skin and
blue flesh, while ``Blue Victor'' has blue skin and white flesh.
   Blue spud plants generally produce less than more traditional
varieties and size is likely to be smaller.
   White eggplant may be smaller than the regular purple varietles
and as they mature they may turn yellow. The flavor also may be
stronger.
   And there are golden beets that can be used for the same dishes
as red beets without bleeding their color into surrounding
vegetables.
   Some traditionally green and yellow vegetables have gone to red
and yellow, including green beans with purple pods named ``Royal
Burgundy,'' a purple cauliflower named ``Royal Purple,'' and an okra
with deep red pods, simply called red okra. The color changes to
dark green upon cooking.
   Red cabbages and red lettuce add color to your garden. Among them
are ``Ruby Ball'' and ``Red Acre'' cabbage and ``Red Salad Bowl''
and ``Ruby'' lettuce.
   Ray Rothenberger, horticulture specialist at the University of
Missouri Cooperative Extension Service, has said that ``gardeners
often want flowers, fruits and vegetables in colors other than those
natural to the plant. In nature, as well as by the manipulation of
breeders, unusual colors sometimes appear _ although relatively
rarely. Some of them can be reproduced and made available for garden
use while others are short-lived and may never be seen again.
   ``For the vegetable garden,'' he said, ``you may find white
pumpkins, green cantaloupes, red brussels sprouts, striped beets,
blue potatoes, yellow radishes, white acorn squash, and even yellow
strawberries.
   Rothenberger said a red brussels sprout has been introduced from
Europe. Named Rubine, it maintains its red coloring during cooking.
Acorn squash also may be found in yellow, as well as dark green.
   ``For the gardener, as well as on the plate,'' Rothenberger said,
``unusual colors add interest, novelty and perhaps new tastes.''
   Cornell researchers also reported that the traditional white
heads of cauliflower may be challenged by an orange-colored cousin,
a head that looks and tastes like the white variety, one that
``seemingly has a cheese sauce bred into it, has a longer shelf-life
and is very nutritious.''
   A big question marketers will face is the saleability of the
unusally colored cauliflower, so a curious Richard M. Dickson of
Cornell took 100 heads of orange cauliflower to a popular Geneva,
N.Y.-area farm market.
   ``I think this is a winner,'' said Joseph Nicholson, who operates
Red Jacket Orchards. ``I believe there is a ready acceptance for
this color because it is novel and because it looks as if it's been
drenched with cheese sauce.''
   He said the test supply sold readily, as did a second 100
provided by Dickson.
   Dickson said the orange cauliflower, identified only by number
now, ``promises to be something more than just a number once a
nutrition-minded public discovers its benefits.''

<TEXT>
   Who says the only good bug is a dead bug? One of the best bugs to
have in your garden is the ladybug. Each day, it feeds on many
``bad'' insects, such as aphids, Colorado potato beetles, grape
rootworms, alfalfa weevils, plus others. This helps keep things in
natural balance.
   The black-spotted red ladybird, better known as ladybug, is a
voracious, predatory beetle described as one the most beneficial on
earth.
   Millions of them have been released on croplands, their hearty
appetites helping to reduce aphid populations _ with biological pest
control.
   Cornell University scientists note the advantages of biological
controls: There is no environmental damage; the pests do not develop
resistance to their predators as they do to chemicals, and a small
initial investment results in a safe, permanent control method.
   In Palo Alto, Calif., some years ago, park officials released
300,000 ladybugs to fight plant pests. Gardeners in Albuquerque,
N.M., scattered more than 2.5 mlllion ladybugs to protect plants. In
Medford, Ore., Jackson and Perkins invited thousands of ladybugs to
an aphid feast in their rose test garden.
   National Geographic magazine has reported 4,300 known species of
ladybugs, or which North America has 370. Remember tne children's
chant: ``Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home, your house is on fire,
your children will burn.'' This was a plea by English farmers
concerned for the safety of ladybugs during the annual burning of
hop fields.
   Given a chance, an adult egg-laying ladybug may consume up to 200
aphids a day. One larva may eat between 200 and 300 during its
development.
   National Geographic noted that ladybugs were put to work by man
in the late 1800s when a species, Rodolia cardinalis, was imported
into California from Australia to combat the cottony cushion scale
insect, saving the citrus industry in two years at a cost of only
$1,500.
   Ladybugs are sold by the pint, quart and gallon; a half-pint
means about 4,000 ladybugs.
   A major concern is in getting the tiny migratory insects not to
fly away home. California studies indicate that 90 percent wing off
after release. Since they don't fly at night, a late afternoon or
early evening release will encourage at least an overnight stay.
   The beetles are very mobile. When there only a few aphids around,
a Cornell researcher reported, they migrate, searching for other
areas of food, scouting apple crops, oats, winter wheat, sugar beets
and beans. The researchers imported the predacious European
seven-spotted lady beetle to help protect potato and alfalfa fields.
   There is no correlation between the number of spots and the
beetle's age. The number of spots on a beetle's back is
characteristic of its species, not its age.
   Ladybugs are but one example of millions of harmless insects,
Cornell noted. In fact, fewer than 2 percent of all insects are
pests and those are ``often controlled by natural enemies.'' The
researchers recommend that gardeners and homeowners be certain that
insects are actually doing damage before they take action.
   Insects belong in a garden. They are natural and often harmless,
if not beneficial. Spray only if you detect damage. Beneficial
insects such as ladybugs ot all kinds and green lacewings should be
protected, entomologists say. By learning to identify their eggs and
larvae, we may save time, money, energy and the environment.
   Many ladybugs have been released in recent years to devour aphids
feeding on upstate New York alfalfa, peaches and potatoes.
   If you see an unattractive, dark insect with orange, blue and
black patches and a deeply segmented body covered with spines, don't
squash it. It may be an immatore lady beetle, hungry and looking for
a meal.
   One catalog (Burpee) offers a half-pint for $9.95, a quart for
$17.95, recommending they be released in small batches.

   If summer brings a lull to your gardening activity, perhaps
you'll have time to build a rock garden.
   Select a location that has at least a half-day of sun _ more is
better if you want to make a show of flowering plants.
   A steep slope or the vicinity of a rock outcrop is good. Not
everyone has such a location, however, and we suggest you avoid
making a round pile in the middle of a lawn. Instead, place the rock
garden in a corner, off to the side, next to a foundation or
bordering steps.
   If the area is level, change the grade. Shovel out the soil a
foot to 18 inches and slope it, perhaps, making two hills with a
valley between. Then put in a 6-inch layer of stones or gravel for
drainage. On this foundation replace the soil, mixing in sand or
gravel to improve drainage. Add some peat.
   Then develop the contour, with the lowest or largest stones
embedded to make them look as though they have always been there.
Then add your next layer with the spaces between filled with the
mixture or medium for the plants to grow in.
   We suggest you place rocks horizontally and in a line so that
they appear to be part of a bed or layer. Avoid ``dragon's teeth,''
or pointed sharp rocks standing up. We prefer one kind of stone, not
a collection, and mica-infested rocks are quite gaudy.
   Continue building to a reasonable height, then place a few stones
to tie in the main groupings in the garden. You can move them around
until you get the right effect, then imbed the rocks into the soil.
   Finally, place your plants. A narrow hand trowel is handy to dig
between the rocks.
   Select low, creeping plants, not border flowers. Consider
alyssum, aubrietas, low pinks, armerias, creeping phlox, miniature
iris or other miniatures, spring and fall crocus, snowdrops and
other low-growing varieties.
   You don't have to feed often. Water when necessary and weed or
loosen soil if necessary.

   The primary use of houseplant containers is to hold the soil for
plants to grow in, but they have a major influence on plant growth
because they affect a plant's water supply.
   The size and porosity of plant containers and the presence or
absence of drainage holes in the bottom are critical factors, says
Lee Taylor, Michigan State University Extension horticulture
specialist. The relative sizes of the pot and the plant it holds
affect both the plant's water and nutrient supplies.
   Taylor says that ``a plant that's too large for its pot dries out
quickly. A plant in an oversized pot may suffer from too much water
because, after watering, the soil stays saturated for a long time.
Also, the nutrients in the soil may be leached out before the plant
has a chance to use them.''
   The container's porosity affects the plant's water supply by
influencing how quickly the soil dries out after watering.
Householders who tend to overwater plants should avoid glazed, glass
or plastic containers because they keep water from moving out of the
soil and air from moving in. On the other hand, porous clay pots
permit air to move into the soil and water to escape. This is
important because plant roots need air as well as water to function.
   Roots that stay a long time in water-logged soil tend to rot and
die.
   Excess water escapes through drainage holes.
   Taylor says it is important to discard excess water after the
soil is thoroughly moistened so that the soil can dry. If the pot
sits in water after the soll is thoroughly moistened, the soil wlll
absorb water as fast as it's lost to evaporation or taken up by
plant roots. As a result, the spaces between soil particles will
remain filled with water rather than air. Using clay pots with
drainage holes and saucers is no guarantee that you won't overwater
plants. Clay might be a good choice, however, if you tend to kill
your plants with too much attention, says Taylor. If you want the
decorative look of glazed ceramic pots, simply place the porous clay
pot inside the fancy container.

   The most critical time for young plants transplanted to your
garden is the first week. Don't plant such tender crops as tomatoes,
peppers, petunias, impatiens and begonias until all danger of frost
has ended. Planting too early is perhaps the major cause of loss of
bedding plants.
   Some animal and insect problems can be averted with pesticides
and other products available in garden shops. Buy good quality
transplant seedlings as well as seeds.
   Short, compact, bushy plants with some side shoots already formed
are better than tall, thin, straggly items that have had to stretch
to reach light or are spindly due to overcrowded roots.
   In buying such popular bedding plants as tomatoes, marigolds,
salvias and petunias, choose healthy, dark green color. Avoid plants
with yellow, wilted or shrivelled leaves.
   If you buy seedlings in peat pots, gently remove the bottom of
the pot and release the roots. While roots will penetrate the peat,
which eventually will decompose, a dry period could keep roots
pot-bound and hinder good development. Be careful not to tear the
plant roots.
   Water all plants thoroughly immediately after transplanting.

   Many food crops, including strawberries, cherries, blueberries
and sweet corn, suffer bird damage. One way to protect them is to
float a special ``scare-eye'' balloon, reported successful in
scaring birds ln Japan.
   Other ways are to use firecrackers, sonic devices, carbide and
propane cannons, rubber snakes, owl decoys and netting, but birds
get used to these and their effectiveness diminishes.
   The ``scare-eye'' balloon is hung from trees or long poles to
frighten away marauding birds. The balloons are made from heavy
gauge, weather-proof vinyl, the size of basketballs.
   The manufacturer, Hartmann's Plantation, Grand Junction, Mich.,
says control is most effective with birds that flock, but that
swallows, purple martins and songbirds are not frightened by the
eye. Hartmann's recommends two balloons per small garden, six per
acre of orchard of farm crop.

   What do you do with the clippings after moving the lawn?
   Put them back into the earth with a mulching mower, say spokesmen
at the Bolens Corp.
   Mulching results in generally greener and healthier lawns because
the nutrients are returned to the soil, they say. Mulch particles
decompose and are absorbed by the grass root system within 14 days.

   Root rot and crown rot, army worms and cutworms, blister beetles
and Japanese beetles, lace bugs, mealy bugs and spittle bugs: this
is just a sampling of the ills that plants are heir to.
   Some can be prevented; some treated by natural or chemical means.
   Many experts say that a healthy plant is less likely to succumb
to illness or damage, while others say this may be more coincidence
than direct cause and effect. But it's generally agreed that the
conditions that make the plant healthy are also likely to help curb
the spread of pests and disease.
   Joel Flagler, Rutgers University agricultural-resources
management agent for Bergen County, N.J., says that for a plant to
be healthy, it must be suited to the conditions under which it will
grow. Soil, moisture and light must all be appropriate. He and
others suggest having soil tested. It can be done through the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension services
throughout the country. And there are kits for testing soil oneself.
   Some pests can be avoided or controlled through ``companion
planting'' _ planting one plant as a decoy or pest repellent near
another that one is cultivating. Thalassa Cruso, in ``Making
Vegtetables Grow,'' suggests nasturtiums to lure aphids from
cucumbers, marigolds to control root nematodes (microscopically
small worms), and plenty of garlic as an overall repellent. She also
relays suggestions that dill will keep away tomato worms, mint
provides insurance against ants, and radishes protect cucumbers,
squash and melons.
   Rotating crops is another way to keep pests or disease from
getting established. And gardeners can buy certified seed and plants
bred to be disease-resistant. Also, isolate for a while any new
plant you acquire through gift or purchase, so you can determine
whether it is healthy.
   And don't forget the bugs that eat other bugs, and the birds with
their appetite for insects.
   A home gardener who has read up on the subject or had a bit of
experience may be able to diagnose some plant problems: Highly
visible white flies, the fine webs that spider mites leave on the
underside of leaves, Japanese beetles. If a plant is cut off at the
soil line, you may find a cutworm (a type of grub) in the
surrounding soil. Remove and squash it.
   Remove-and-squash is not a particularly attractive idea, but it's
also useful against tomato worms, slugs, Japanese beetles and the
Japanese beetle grub, which resembles a cutworm.
   Other plant ailments are harder to diagnose, and the gardener may
wish to follow the suggestion of ``1,000 Garden Questions, Vol.
II,'' edited by Marjorie Dietz, and send a sample to the nearest
Agricultural Experiment Station for analysis.
   In the case of some pests, a strong blast of water from a hose
may drive them away. A spraying with insecticidal soap is another
possible solution.
   Then there are the pesticides.
   Some _ rotenone and pyrethrum, for instance _ have organic
sources. They come from plants. Others are chemical compounds.
   Garden experts urge one to use any pesticide exactly as directed.
   They warn, too, that what harms the pest may also hurt other
insect or animal life. For instance, Elvin MacDonald, director of
special projects at the Brooklyn, N.Y., Botanic Garden, says that
systemic pesticides, working through the soil, may hurt friendly
bacteria as well as harmful ones.
   For anyone inclined to blame geography for his gardening
troubles, Dara Emery, a plant breeder at the Santa Barbara, Calif.,
Botanic Garden, offers consolation of a sort: Most plant problems
can occur anywhere. True, he says, California roses have less black
spot and rust, but mildew and spotted mites still cause problems.
And people in other parts of the country don't have the problem of
salts that get into the soil in California through needed irrigation.
   Finally, the gardener pestered by pests can always resort to an
old-fashioned solution mentioned by MacDonald: Grow enough for
everyone, including the insects.

   Is there such a thing as painless gardening?
   Judy Glatstein, an instructor in design at the New York Botanical
Garden and herself a gardener in Wilton, Conn., says perhaps not _
but there are many things one can do to minimize the aches.
   Use tools appropriate to the job, she urges. If you're planting
just a few bulbs, a trowel will do; for large quantities, dig up the
area involved with a shovel or spade. Don't use a heavy pump sprayer
if you have only a few bushes or plants to spray. A small container
with a hand trigger will do.
   Reading seed catalogs in winter is fun, but it won't keep you in
shape for gardening in the spring. Mrs. Glatstein, Fred McGourty, a
Norwalk, Conn., nurseryman who teaches at the New York Botanical
Garden, and others urge exercise _ walking, swimming, other sports
during the winter. And in the spring, start gardening slowly; don't
try to put in a full day right off.
   Lifting is less likely to give gardeners aching backs if they
bend the knees, grasp the item to be lifted, and then straighten up.
   Mrs. Glatstein also says heavy things should be carried _ if they
must be carried _ close to the body. But she adds, ``Man invented
the wheel for a reason,'' so get a wheelbarrow or garden cart for
heavy moving. The bigger the wheels, the more maneuverable the cart.
   Knees ache from damp earth? Pads for kneeling can be purchased at
garden centers or elsewhere _ or made at home, using scrap foam
rubber. Or try raised beds, or a hanging garden, in pots.
   Joel Flagler, a Rutgers University agricultural-resources
management agent in New Jersey, says garden centers and garden
supply catalogs offer all kinds of adaptive tools that make it
possible for elderly or handicapped people to garden, and for anyone
to garden more comfortably. Wood or aluminum handles can extend the
length of standard shovels, hoes or cultivators. Low folding chairs
and stools enable one to sit while weeding or hoeing.
   Attitude toward gardening may also contribute to pain or
painlessness, some gardeners say.
   To keep up your morale, take on chores you can complete, urges
Mrs. Glatstein. Then go on to something else. She says beginning
gardeners should keep their gardens small and choose plants that are
easy to maintain.
   Elvin MacDonald, director of special projects at Brooklyn Botanic
Garden in New York, also urges gardeners to relax. ``If you think
weeding hard dirt a curse, then you're more likely to get
blisters,'' he says.
   Tools should feel comfortable to the user and should be used
properly. Short or tall, strong or not so strong, the gardener
buying a tool should look around until finding one that feels right.
   The Cooperative Extension service at Cornell University in New
York State offers these tips:
   _ Don't leave a rake on the ground with the tines pointed upward.
If you step on it, the handle may hit you in the face (and the tines
could hurt your foot).
   _ Wear gloves when picking up garden debris, in case there are
thorns or other sharp items.
   _ Wear protective goggles when using power equipment, and a mask
over mouth and nose when spraying with insecticide.

   Christian Dior, Anna Pavlova and the Empress
Josephine found immortality in the rose garden, but the honor
requires luck _ and lots of money.
   For centuries, rose breeders have named new varieties in honor of
the heroic, the beautiful and the famous. But they won't guarantee
the flower will catch the public's fancy.
   It costs up to $62,000 to buy the right to name a rose, says
Terry Kenwright, vice president of the British Association of Rose
Breeders.
   He said it can take as long as 15 years to develop a new blossom,
and ``breeders are businessmen. They want some reward for their
effort.''
   Britain's 17 professional breeders introduce only 35 new
varieties each year on average, and only a fraction of those are
available for private naming.
   Newspapers, charities and big businesses have roses named after
them. There's a Chrysler Imperial rose and a Times rose. The Everest
Double Fragrance is named after a storm window factory.
   One of the oldest and most famous cultivated roses is the fragile
pink flower the French call Cuisse de Nymphe _ Nymph's Thigh. The
British, who have grown it for 500 years, prefer to call it Great
Maiden's Blush.
   A blossom named after a factory might smell as sweet, but could
it so perfectly evoke the silken cheek of youth?
   In the depths of winter, a rose catalog with its mysterious and
seductive names offers a promise of spring. There is Eglantine,
Celestial, Rose d'Amour, Black Prince and the splendid crimson
Cardinal de Richelieu.
   Even rosa horrida, described in one catalog as ``a strange,
gooseberry-like bush'' from the 18th century, appeals to the
curiosity.
   There are dashing dukes, Grandpa Dickson and the dress designer
Dior. But the honors go mostly to the ladies: Penelope, ballet
dancer Anna Pavlova, dozens of duchesses and Ma Perkins.
   Roses have inspired wonderful tales about their origin: A jealous
goddess created the flower to rival Venus' beauty; the first rose
sprang from the sweat of the prophet Mohammed or fell from the hair
of Aurora as she combed her golden locks.
   One of history's greatest rose lovers, Napoleon's empress
Josephine, grew every known rose of the day at Malmaison chateau and
is honored by the pale pink Souvenir de la Malmaison.
   The unfortunate Atom Bomb, reputedly quite a nice red rose, never
caught on and disappeared from the catalogs soon after its
introduction in 1954.
   Some say the Peace rose by any other name might not have become
one of the most popular modern varieties. Bred in southern France
during World War II and shipped out of the country just before
Hitler's armies invaded, it was named in the United States on the
day Berlin fell to the Allies.
   Hundreds of Peace blooms were sent to the first United Nations
Conference in 1945. It was planted in gardens and at memorials, and
by the mid-1950s, an estimated 30 million of the bushes had been
sold.
   Few dare to speak ill of this famous yellow rose tinged with
pink, but some mutter under their breath that it has no fragrance,
and can a rose be a rose be a rose without perfume?

   Arugula. Cardoon. Gobo. Scorzonera.
   No, they're not rare diseases, nor are they foreign phrases that
will get your face slapped.
   They are among dozens of new and unusual gourmet vegetables _
some call them ``designer vegetables'' _ on a list compiled for home
gardeners and commercial growers by a Cornell University vegetable
crop specialist.
   Unconventional crops have become increasingly popular in recent
years, says Robert A. Kline, a senior extension associate for
Cornell Cooperative Extension in the College of Life and Sciences at
the Ithaca, N.Y., school. Kline attributes the interest to the
increase in health-conscious consumers, who eat more conventional
vegetables and are looking for diversity.
   ``The market for these unconventional vegetables will continue to
expand,'' he says, ``and vegetable growers in the Northeast should
have a share of that growing market.''
   Similar conclusions have been reached by Richard VanVranken, an
agricultural agent in Atlantic County, N.J., for the Rutgers
Cooperative Extension Service.
   At a recent convention of the New Jersey Annual Vegetable
Meeting, VanVranken said that baby carrots, endive, radicchio,
oriental radishes, fennel, and mung beans are some of the vegetable
varieties that restaurant chefs love to experiment with and home
cooks are not afraid to try.
   Robert L. Bidner, president of RLB Food Distributors of West
Caldwell, N.J., said, ``A few years ago, if I tried to introduce the
avocado to a grocer, he would have laughed me out the door. Not
anymore. There's a national preoccupation with health and fitness,
and waves of new immigrants, and sophisticated consumers who read
food magazines.''
   That's one of the reasons that Cornell's Kline developed his list
of more than 240 varieties of some 50 crops, based on field trials
conducted over the past three years.
   His recommended crops range from Jerusalem artichoke to a rare
tomato called ``tomatillo'' that yields golf-ball-sized fruit inside
papery sheathes, or capsules. It is used to make salsa, a spicy
sauce.
   Arugula? That's a spicy, leafy vegetable used in salads. Gobo is
a root crop popular in Japan. Cardoon is a leafy vegetable with a
wide ``vein'' in the middle; only the vein is eaten. And scorzonera
is a type of salsify known as ``vegetable oyster'' or ``oyster
plant'' because its black-skinned roots taste somewhat like oysters.
   Other exotic crops recommended include radicchio, a type of
chicory that forms a head much like lettuce; witloof, a Belgian
endive; Chinese artichoke, which produces very small potato-like
tubers, and escarole, a kind of endive with flatter leaves.

   Remember ``The Day of the Triffids,'' the science-fiction
thriller in which a hail of seeds blossom into fast-growing plants?
   Or the musical ``Little Shop of Horrors,'' in which a talking,
moving plant takes over control?
   These, it seemed, were the stuff movies and fantasies were made
of.
   But a University of Miami biophysicist says there actually are
plants that move.
   ``Most plants don't move,'' says Thomas J. Herbert, one of a
handful of scientists interested in how plants move _ and why they
bother. ``But a surprising number do, although they don't go walking
around the ground like triffids,'' which are technically
three-parted leaves.
   Twelve or 14 plant families have members that can move their
leaves relatively rapidly, says the biophysicist at the Coral
Gables, Fla., school. The leaves of one ``sensitive'' plant, he
says, fold up and seem to draw away when touched.
   ``They're an extreme example because they move so rapidly,'' he
says.
   Many legumes, members of the pea family, are capable of
conspicuous motion. Others, more commonly, react to sunlight and
water.
   Herbert says that he hopes by studying plants that are capable of
movement, more can be learned about what conditions are important
for all plants.
   ``I use them like a little computer,'' says Herbert. ``They can
readjust the position of their leaves for various conditions of sun,
heat, water and so forth. So, observing them is like telling the
plant, `Find me the leaf angle you like best in these conditions.'
And the plant responds. And that response, we assume, is telling us
what's best for it.
   ``In this way, we can begin to understand the needs of other
plants that can't move.''
   He says that understanding the needs of plants may lead to the
adjustment of conditions for plants, to the benefit of people.

   Avid gardeners are careful to protect their ferns from bright
sunlight, their roses from harmful aphids and their lawns from
drought _ but unfortunately they often don't take the same care to
protect their eyes.
   According to the American Optometric Association, nearly 3,400
Americans suffer eye injuries from lawn mowers and home gardening
equipment every year, and most of the injuries could be prevented
with safety eyewear.
   Regular prescription glasses or contact lenses are not enough,
the association says. Although eyeglasses are by federal regulation
impact-resistant, they are not safety glasses and are no match for
rocks tossed up by power mowers.
   Also, notes the industry trade group, spray or dust from weed
killers and fertilizers can get around regular glasses and into the
eyes.
   Since contact lenses offer little protection, the optometrists
add, non-prescription safely eyewear should be worn over them. They
also suggest that inexpensive plastic safety goggles sold at
hardware and department stores _ or types that fit over prescription
eyewear _ will meet most home gardeners' eye safety needs.
   However, the association advises buyers to make sure the goggles
meet American National Standards Institute standards by looking for
the manufacturer's monogram on the lenses.
   Like many plants, gardener's eyes should be protected from the
sun's harmful rays. Quality sunglases can do the job and provide
comfort by reducing glare, the optometrists say, recommending a
medium or dark gray tint because it does not distort colors.
   Sunglasses, they add, should screen out 75 to 90 percent of the
sunlight.
   Gardeners need good vision to read the instructions on seed
packages, fertilizer bags and weed killer cans, to detect weeds and
to spot fungi or insects on plants.

   The pumpkin seeds are from the 616-pound winner of this year's
World Pumpkin Confederation Contest and cost $5 for a packet of six,
from Dill's Garden Giant in Windsor, Nova Scotia.
   At the other extreme, seeds for miniatures called ``Munchkin
pumpkins,'' measuring only three or four inches, can be ordered
through Harris Seeds in Rochester, N.Y.
   Seeds for flowers to eat can be ordered through Aimer's in
Aurora, Ontario, Canada. Recipes come with the packets.
   The catalog listing also covers perennials from England, hanging
carnations from Australia, fruits, vegetables and flowers that grow
in harsh climates, mushrooms, wildflowers, medicinal plants,
popcorn, salad greens, herbs, specialties for the Oriental kitchen,
and seeds to restore disturbed land.
   The magazine, aimed at gardeners and farmers, also lists sources
for everyday floral and vegetable favorites.

   One plant not valued by gardeners is poison ivy.
   Rashes resulting from poison ivy encounters most often occur in
summer, when it thrives and victims are lightly dressed.
   The best thing, of course, is to recognize and avoid the plant.
But if you make contact, act quickly and thoroughly to minimize the
discomfort.
   Here are some pointers recommended by the 3M First Aid Center:
   _ Remember that the poison is in the sap found on leaves or
roots, not the leaves themselves.
   _ Choose clothing that offers the best coverage if you're going
to be gardening in an area where there might be poison ivy. Long
pants, socks, long sleeves and gloves are advised.
   _ Clothes that have come into contact with the sap can spread the
infection, so remove them carefully and wash them immediately. Treat
garden equipment, particularly handles, the same way.
   _ If your skin comes into contact with the sap, wash the area
right away. Washing with soap and water two or three times may even
prevent your getting a rash, though that ultimately depends on your
own sensitivity to the toxins in the sap.
   _ Itching and rash probably will appear from 24 to 48 hours after
contact. Keep the area clean and dry. If blisters develop, clean and
dress the affected area, especially if the skin is broken, since a
secondary infection may set in. _ If the rash is widespread or keeps
you from getting on with your daily activities, contact your doctor.
Prescription steroids taken orally may bring relief in serious
cases, but don't rely on over-the-counter steroid creams, because
they won't help.
   _ If the rash is localized, the best thing is to let the
condition run its course, usually two or three weeks.

   Seventy thousand consumers were injured while using outdoor power
equipment in 1987, most of them adults over age 25, according to
statistics from the Consumer Product Safety Commission's National
Electronic Injury Surveillance System.
   The Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, a national trade
association of manufacturers, offers this advice to consumers:
   _ Be sure you know how to operate your equipment before you
start. Read the operator's manual.
   _ Dress properly for the job. Wear substantial shoes, long pants
and close-fitting clothes; no loose jewelry or unrestrained hair.
   _ Handle gasoline carefully. Store gas in an approved container,
away from the house. Fill up before you start. Wipe up spills and
never light a match, or smoke, while gasoline is being used.
   _ Clean up and clear out the area _ including other people and

   A healthy green lawn may still be possible this season even if it
suffered damage in last summer's heat and drought.
   If more than half of the lawn is in good shape, it can be rescued
by renovation and overseeding, according to Bob Tracinski, consumer
information manager for John Deere, manufacturers of lawn and garden
equipment.
   Renovation includes cleaning the lawn of weeds, thatch and
debris. Overseeding is planting new seed over the entire area. ``Not
only will renovation take care of the trouble spots, it's a
beneficial treatment for the existing lawn,'' Tracinski says.
   He suggests starting the rehabilitation by testing the soil, so
that its lime and fertilizer needs can be determined. The testing
can be done by most county extension offices for a small charge.
Prepare the samples by cutting thin slices six or seven inches below
the lawn's surface, including soil from several areas of the lawn.
Put them into clean containers labeled with information about the
location of the soil and what you intend to plant there.
   Next, remove unwanted weeds and grasses, using a herbicide that
will not leave a residue that might harm healthy grass or new
seedlings. Expect to wait several weeks before attempting to plant
new seed.
   Thatch, a layer of leaves, dead grass and other debris,
accumulates between the grass blades and the soil surface. It can
build up thickly enough to prevent water and nutrients from getting
to the soil, and it can harbor pests and disease. The easiest way to
deal with it is by using a thatching machine or thatching
attachments for riding mowers and lawn tractors, which can be
rented. These function as mechanical rakes, cutting into the lawn
vertically and slicing the debris with sharp blades or tines.
   Then the soil should be loosened up and aerated, to allow air,
water and nutrients to pass through to the roots of the grass.
Aerating can be done manually by punching holes in the soil with a
large spike or by a machine that can be rented. It's easiest to work
on a damp lawn.
   If the soil test points to lime or fertilizer, add them next. For
most lawns, a fertilizer ratio of three parts nitrogen, one part
phosphorus, and two parts potassium works best. Use no more than one
pound of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet of lawn.
   The ground is now ready for new seed, which should be spread
evenly over the area, raking it in lightly with the bare soil. Seeds
should be covered with no more than one-quarter inch of soil.
   Finish and maintain the lawn with regular sprinkling, fertilizing
and mowing. In hot, dry weather, water several times a day.

   A method of increasing vegetable yields using
available resources, developed by a Cornell University graduate, is
bringing better nutrition to people in underdeveloped Third World
nations.
   Called ``bio-intensive gardening,'' the technique depends on
local conditions and uses available plant and animal wastes rather
than expensive imported fertilizers. Coupled with basic knowledge
about crop rotation and companion planting best for small plots, the
method has increased vegetable crop yields wherever it has been
tried.
   Julian Gonsalves, senior researcher at the International
Institute for Rural Reconstruction in the Philippines, developed
bio-intensive gardening while a graduate student at Cornell. His
demonstration project in the Philippines started with three rural
villages and grew to 224 villages by the second growing season.
   In each village, several local farmers were trained in the
technique, including seed bed preparation, use of organic
fertilizers, composting and natural pest control. The farmers
applied the techniques to small family vegetable plots, usually
about 200 square feet. They followed up with discussions with
Institute technicians about problems encountered, such as soil
erosion after heavy rain. Technicians then could devise techniques
to deal with the problem, using available resources.
   Bio-intensive farming has been used successfully in both
high-rainfall and arid climates.

   What is a good houseplant for an office where the air may be dry
in winter and the light isn't great?
   Try a Chinese evergreen (aglaonema commutatum), which tolerates
dry air and temperatures ranging from 85 degrees to 60 degrees or
lower and does well in low light. Water this plant when the soil
surface feels dry to keep the roots moist but not drenched.

   Your houseplant ferns turn brown and dry. What's the problem?
   Ferns often are challenging to grow in the house because they
usually prefer cool temperatures (a maximum of about 72 degrees in
the daytime), indirect light, moist soil and humid air.
   Browning and drying of frond tips and yellowing and drooping of
interior leaves usually mean that the air is too dry. Place ferns in
an area of the house that is naturally more humid, such as the
kitchen, bathroom or laundry room. Or place plants in trays of wet
gravel and use a room humidifier to add moisture to the air. The
humidifier may help your comfort, too.

   Vegetable spaghetti can be used the same way as the pasta. It's a
hard-shelled squash with spaghetti-like pulp.
   Grow it like any other garden squash, harvesting it when the
shell is hard. To prepare, scoop out the pulp and cook in boiling
water, or boil the squash whole first and scoop it out after. Serve
with your favorite spaghetti sauce.

   Intelligent neglect is what cactus plants need in winter. Cacti
are essentially dormant then and susceptible to overwatering. Keep
them in a cool area _ 40-45 degrees _ and water monthly. Don't feed

   If houseplants on windowsills develop black blotches on leaves
and some become droopy, it could be cold injury. Many of these
plants originated in the tropics and can easily be damaged easily by
low or freezing temperatures.
   Leaves that touch cold window glass in winter may freeze and turn
black, especially if closed drapes or blinds deprive the plant of
heated air in the room.
   A remedy is to increase light levels for plants by grouping them
under fluorescent lamps rather than crowding them against cold
windows.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall From Record Level</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index today fell
back from its latest record high, and the dollar dropped against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which climbed
140.56 points to a record high closing of 32,452.49 on Thursday,
fell 166.72 points, or 0.51 percent, ending at 32,285.77 Monday.
   Financial markets in Japan were closed Friday for the state
funeral for Emperor Hirohito.
   The index opened lower in Tokyo today following Friday's sharp
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York, but investors'
expectations for a higher index pushed up prices somewhat, said a
dealer with Nikko Securities.
   After a U.S. interest rate hike, the Dow industrial average fell
43.92 points to a 2,245.54 closing, bringing the week's total losses
to 79.28 points, the average's biggest weekly drop since it fell
81.61 points last August.
   On Friday, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board increased its discount
rate, its charge for loans to private financial institutions, from
6.5 percent to 7 percent, calling this a step to defuse
``inflationary pressures'' in the U.S. economy.
   In Tokyo's afternoon session, many investors moved to the
sidelines to see how trading goes in New York's session, the Nikko
Securities dealer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said another reason for the Nikkei's drop was some investors
selling in spot trading and buying cheaper issues in the futures
market.
   In today's trading, ``almost 50 percent of institutional
investors remained on the sidelines,'' the dealer said, and first
section volume was estimated at 1.1 billion issues.
   In currency dealings, ``trading today was inactive and boring,''
said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa with Daiwa Bank in Tokyo.
   The dollar closed at 126.00 yen, down 0.29 yen from Thursday's
126.29-yen finish. The dollar opened at 125.90 yen and ranged
between 125.75 yen and 126.02 yen.
   The U.S. currency now has lost 1.15 yen in the last three trading
days. The currency market also was closed Friday for the emperor's
funeral.
   Kinugasa said the U.S. interest rate hike had little influence on
the dollar in Tokyo ``because Japanese investors already had
expected the Federal Reserve Board to raise its rate.''
   Concerns over a possible interest hike in West Germany after a
bank meeting scheduled Thursday discouraged major moves on the Tokyo
currency market, he said.
   ``But participants were inclined to dollar-selling,'' he added.

<HEAD>Business Forecast: Slower Growth but no Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic growth will slow significantly this
year while inflation and interest rates both rise, but the country
should be able to avoid a recession, the nation's top business
economists predicted today.
   The National Association of Business Economists says a survey of
its members found them slightly more optimistic about the economy's
fortunes in 1989 than they were just three months ago.
   However, three out of four of the economists still believe
President Bush will have to deal with an economic downturn in the
first two years of his presidency.
   That represented a decline from the 89 percent who last November
expected a recession by the end of 1990, and the number predicting a
recession this year showed an even bigger drop _ from 40 percent
three months ago to 19 percent now.
   But the belief that the current expansion, which has already
lasted a peacetime record of six years, will keep steaming ahead for
two more years is still a minority view held by just one-fourth of
the economists surveyed.
   The median forecast for growth this year, as measured by the
gross national product, was 2.7 percent, up slightly from a 2.5
percent estimate made three months ago.
   That is still one-half percentage point lower than the Bush
administration's estimate that the GNP will expand at the robust
clip of 3.2 percent in 1989.
   The administration is counting on faster growth to bring in more
revenues and help it lower the budget deficit without the need to
resort to higher taxes.
   On the question of interest rates, another critical component of
the budget deficit because of the cost of financing the $2.7
trillion national debt, the business economists see short-term rates
hitting a peak of 8.5 percent this year and then beginning to
decline to 7.8 percent by the end of 1989.
   The administration is forecasting substantially lower rates for
this year.
   The survey was taken before the Federal Reserve boosted the
discount rate on Friday to a three-year high of 7 percent. An
increase in the discount rate, the interest the central bank charges
to make loans to commercial banks, is the most dramatic gesture the
Fed can make to show its determination to push the cost of credit
higher and dampen inflationary pressures.
   The business economists expressed strong support for the Fed's
inflation-fighting battle, with 70 percent expecting the board to
boost interest rates further in the next six months.
   While expressing an urgent need for Congress and the
administration to reach an agreement on a credible deficit reduction
plan, the business economists generally supported Bush's stand
against new taxes. Only about 15 percent of those surveyed said they
believed tax increases should be emphasized over cutting government
spending.
   Among the government programs which should face the knife, a
large majority of the economists, 72 percent, favored slashing farm
subsidies. Cuts in military spending were favored by 55 percent
while 47 percent believed Social Security cost-of-living increases
should be pared to reduce the budget deficit.
   Among those who advocated raising taxes to help get the deficit
under control, the overwhelming favorite place to look was an
increase in the gasoline tax, preferred by 71 percent, followed by
51 percent who said user fees for government services should be
increased.
   On other topics, the business economists said:
   _Inflation will worsen this year with consumer prices climbing by
4.8 percent, compared to an increase of 4.4 percent in both 1987 and
1988.
   _The merchandise trade deficit, which dropped by 20 percent to
$137 billion last year, will continue improving but at a slower rate
in 1989, falling by 12 percent to $120 billion.
   _Unemployment will show little change, averaging 5.5 percent for
the year, the same as in 1988. This estimate was based on a belief
that the economy will be expanding enough to take care of new
entrants into the labor force but not fast enough to make further
inroads in the jobless rate.
   _Personal consumption spending, which accounts for two-thirds of
overall economic activity, will grow by 2.5 percent this year,
little changed from last year, with new housing starts and new auto
sales remaining close to last year's levels.
   The survey on economic projections was based on responses from 69
economists who make up the association's economic forecasting panel
while the assessments of budgetary and monetary policy came from a
broader survey of nearly 300 of the association's members.

<HEAD>Aircraft Accident Another Reflection On Boeing's Name</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Plane Emergency, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another air disaster involving a Boeing Co. plane
has officials of the Seattle-based manufacturer shaking their heads
over what appears to be a lengthy bout with bad luck.
   On Friday, a huge hole ripped open in the fuselage of a United
Airlines Boeing 747 shortly after it took off from Hawaii, and nine
people died when they were sucked from the aircraft. The pilot was
able to land the crippled plane at Honolulu.
   Federal investigators believe failed cargo door locks may be
responsible, but National Transportation Safety Board officials have
not come to any conclusions.
   Although Boeing's business is booming, it's not been a good year
for the aerospace giant, which has seen a number of mishaps and
accidents involving its jets.
   It also is dealing with an embarrassing delay in shipping its
newest airplane, the long-range 747-400, and reports of miswiring in
some newer Boeing models.
   ``What you have here is a series of events, and the only
correlation is that they're happening in the same time frame, but if
you dissect each one you will find that they're totally unrelated,''
said David Jimenez of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
   With news reports of problems in rapid succession, however, ``it
does become one large blur to the public,'' Jimenez said.
   ``The planes carry the Boeing name and it reflects on the Boeing
image any time there's an accident no matter what the cause,'' said
Boeing spokesman John Wheeler. ``We're concerned about what happens
to every airplane throughout its life.''
   Friday's tragedy was chillingly reminiscent of an April 28, 1988,
accident in which a flight attendant was killed and 61 people hurt
when the top of an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 built in the late 1960s
peeled off at 24,000 feet during a flight over Hawaii. That accident
focused attention on the question of how long aging aircraft can fly.
   More recent events that have focused attention on Boeing planes
include the Dec. 21 terrorist bombing of a Pan American 747 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 259 people on the plane and 11 on the
ground were killed; the January crash of a British Midland Airways
737 in England, killing 44 people; and the Feb. 8 crash of a
chartered 707 in the Azores, which left 144 dead.
   Whatever the public perception of Boeing's name, the people who
buy the planes are voting with their checkbooks.
   Last year, Boeing broke industry records for new aircraft orders
at 636 commercial jets worth nearly $30 billion. About 65 percent of
all commercial jets in the air are Boeings.
   Production lines are backed up two years or more at Boeing and
its two competitors, McDonnell Douglass Corp. and Airbus Industrie,
and industry analysts say the boom should continue into the
mid-1990s.

<HEAD>Former Worker: Closure of Foundry Nightmare; Reopening Brings Tears</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seven years ago, Milton Wright entered
a living nightmare.
   The American Steel Foundries plant where he had worked for 19
years closed. Bills mounted as he struggled to find work, and
unemployment put a strain on his marriage, which ended in divorce.
He sought professional help to calm his nerves.
   ``When we shut down, most of us said we're gonna' get a two,
three month's rest,'' Wright, 51, recalled. ``Six months later when
your unemployment runs out, you say, `Hey, what's gonna happen to
me?'
   ``Then, a year later, it's a nightmare.''
   Wright finally found work as a supervisor in another
steel-related plant in this Southern Illinois community, where he
now makes between $30,000 and $40,000 annually. But this week, he
was overjoyed to learn ASF plans to resume production at its
foundry, once the nation's largest producer of railroad
undercarriages, and that he is eligible for recall.
   The foundry's revival is a godsend for more than 200 workers who
expect to be rehired. An estimated 650 employees were laid off when
the plant shut down in late 1982.
   ``I can't think of anything else that would make me happier than
to see this plant open up,'' Wright said. ``I have tears in my eyes
right now.''
   At its peak in 1979, when U.S. manufacturers produced about
94,000 railroad cars, the foundry employed about 1,700 people, said
ASF president Norman A. Berg.
   But then the railroad parts industry collapsed, spurred by
deregulation and an oversupply of cars. In the early 1980s, the
industry faced a surplus of nearly 300,000 railroad cars, said Elwyn
Ahnquist, president of the Chicago-based American Railway Car
Institute.
   Wright, a father of two who lives in nearby Venice across the
Mississippi River from St. Louis, said he was devastated when the
foundry shut down, and had to scramble to feed his children.
   ``You can tell them you ain't got a job, but how do you tell them
you ain't got no food?''
   But the dark days are ending now. The surplus is over, Berg said,
and many of the 1.2 million cars in use now are obsolete or near
that stage.
   In May, he said, the foundry will resume producing cast steel
side frames and bolsters, which form the undercarriages, or trucks,
of railroad cars.
   Already, the plant has 35 employees getting it ready for
reopening, and in the next couple of weeks, another 30 will be added
to complete preparations, plant manager William Donovan said.
   By early summer, the company expects to recall 200 more workers
at roughly a $10 hourly wage.
   The American Railway Car Institute, an association of railroad
car makers, projects the manufacture of about 25,000 cars for 1989,
Ahnquist said.
   Since the early 1980s, Berg said, ASF pumped more than $14
million into the foundry for improvements. In 1988, it spent about
$1 million to ready the plant for possible production.
   ``We're really tickled,'' Berg said. ``We're really excited about
this thing.''
   So is Wright, who calls ASF ``the best company to work for.
   ``Whether I go back or not, I am concerned about my co-workers,''
Wright said. ``Hopefully, they'll be able to go to work at American
Steel and say, `Hey! Once again I'm a working man. I have my pride
back.'''

   The Federal Reserve Board dramatically
escalated its fight against inflation by raising its key bank
lending rate to the highest level in three years to dampen upward
pressure on prices.
   The Fed's action Friday repudiated recent Bush administration
claims that price increases haven't been serious enough to warrant
higher interest rates. Private analysts said the move was long
overdue and should have been stronger.
   The central bank raised the discount rate, the fee it charges for
short-term loans to member banks, 7 percent from 6.5 percent.

   Federal bank regulators, in a report to
Congress, rejected charges that their policies discourage banks from
forgiving part of the huge debt owed by Third World countries.
   ``Current regulatory policy and accounting policies have not
prevented banks, that were otherwise inclined to do so, from
participating in a wide range of negotiated debt reduction
transactions with borrowing countries,'' three regulatory agencies
said in a report Friday to the Senate Banking Committee.
   Critics of current policy say banks should be permitted to spread
the effects of recognizing losses over several years. Currently,
they must reduce profita by the full amount of any addition to loss
reserves.

<HEAD>Japan to Change Monitoring Provision of Semiconductor Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan has decided to alter its monitoring of
overseas computer chip prices, one of the key provisions of a
semiconductor agreement between it and the United States, an
official said Monday.
   Under the pact, reached in 1985, Japan pledged it would monitor
the prices of Japanese memory chips sold in third countries as a
means of discouraging their resale in the United States at cheap
prices.
   The agreement resulted from a series of complaints by U.S.
semiconductor makers that Japanese companies had sold memory chips
in the United States below their fair market price, a practice known
as dumping.
   The monitoring provision has been sharply criticized by European
countries, which charged it regulated prices in other nations and
therefore violated the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, an international trade organization.
   In a ruling last March, the GATT said the European complaint was
valid.
   ``The third-country monitoring is not consistent with the GATT,
so we will have to modify the agreement,'' said Taizo Nakatomi, an
official in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
   He said a high ministry official, Tetsu Mizuno, left for
Washington on Sunday to discuss a modification of the pact with U.S.
trade officials.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper, reported that
Mizuno will seek U.S. consent to discontinue the third-country
monitoring. But Nakatomi said Mizuno had no concrete position and
would try to reach a compromise with the United States on how to
change the provision.
   ``Under the arrangement with the United States, we have an
obligation to monitor prices and sales. But the European Community
is saying that we have to completely modify the provision. That's a
dilemma for us,'' Nakatomi said.
   He said the Japanese government hoped to find a ``middle ground
between the two extremes.''
   In the bilateral semiconductor agreement, Japan also pledged to
set a ``fair price'' for exports of certain key memory chips to the
United States, establish a ``supply and demand forecast committee''
intended to stabilize prices and supply of memory chips, and
increase the sales of U.S.-made semiconductors in Japan.
   In April 1987, the United States imposed $300 million in tariffs
on Japan as a penalty for having allegedly violated the agreement by
continuing to dump memory chips and reneging on the pledge to
improve market access.
   Two months later, the United States reduced the penalties by $135
million after ruling that Japanese makers had stopped dumping,
leaving $165 million still in effect because of the market share
issue.
   Japan claims it has removed market restrictions and U.S.
companies must try harder if they want to increase their sales in
Japan.
   European countries are currently negotiating a separate
semiconductor pact with Japan that would regulate prices of
Japanese-made memory chips in Europe but not in other nations, news
reports say.
   The agreement also would not include any pledge by Japan to
increase sales of European chips inside Japan, the economic weekly
Japan Economic Journal reported.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.15 to 2,238.39
in the first half hour of trading.

   The market's slide last week came amid signs of increasing
inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.
   The bank prime lending rate rose for the second time this month,
and the Federal Reserve raised its discount rate.
   Analysts said that combination of events challenged a widely held
assumptions among investors that the Fed had a strong hold in its
effort to restrain inflation, and that interest rates were near a

<HEAD>SEC Reportedly Investigating Prime Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly
is investigating whether MAI Basic Four Inc. violated federal stock
margin rules in its hostile bid for Prime Computer Inc.
   An MAI spokesman confirmed that SEC investigators questioned
executives about the value of collateral MAI pledged to finance the
takeover offer, according to a published report today.
   MAI Basic, based in Tustin, Calif., is offering $20 a share for
Prime in a deal that values the Natick minicomputer maker at $970
million.
   The Boston Globe said congressional sources told it about the SEC
investigation into the takeover bid. SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue
today declined to comment on the report.
   The Federal Reserve sets margin rules to limit the amount of
unsecured debt used to back the purchase of stock. Stock has been
pledged to back loans of nearly $1.5 billion that MAI would use to
buy Prime.
   ``We've had informal, cordial and cooperative discussions with
SEC staff,'' an MAI spokesman said. ``We've answered all of the
questions they've asked of us. And as we previously stated in our
offering documents, we believe our offer complies with all margin
rules.''
   U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone blocked MAI's bid last
month. A hearing is scheduled Thursday before the 1st U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Boston.
   MAI is challenging Prime's defenses against the takeover in
Delaware Chancery Court.
   Mazzone in late December said the highly leveraged nature of
MAI's bid raised questions about compliance with margin requirements.
   U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Massachusetts
Democratic Congressmen Edward J. Markey and Barney Frank had
questioned the SEC's enforcement of federal margin rules in
takeovers.
   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder said the commission is examining
``factual and legal questions relating to possible margin violations
in...pending tender offers.''

   The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge to
a proposed $2 billion Times Square redevelopment project in New York
City opponents say will mean more traffic congestion and air
pollution.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the
redevelopment will lead to violations of federal clean air standards.
   Challengers to the project include Brendan Gill, a well-known
author and critic; Stephen F. Wilder, head of the Metropolitan
Transit Authority's citizens advisory committee; and others who live
and work in the midtown Manhattan area.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last August that the
challengers are not entitled to renew their attack on the project.
The appeals court said the opponents already ``have had their day in
court,'' losing a state court challenge to the redevelopment.
   There is no need to relitigate the issues in federal court, the
appeals court said as it upheld a federal judge's dismissal of the
lawsuit.
   There have been more than two dozen legal challenges to the
project by environmentalists, local residents, business owners and
others who say it will destroy historic landmarks.
   The plans include redevelopment of 13 acres centered on 42nd
Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. The project would include
construction of four large office towers, a 2.4-million-square-foot
wholesale mart and a hotel. It also would include the renovation of
nine movie houses into theaters and retail space.
   The case is Wilder vs. Thomas, 88-1103.

<HEAD>Court Won't Revive Indiana Affirmative Action Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive an
affirmative action program in South Bend, Ind., that called for
hiring more blacks and Hispanics as firefighters and police officers.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck down
the plan after it was challenged by a white man denied a job as a
firefighter.
   The justices themselves last Jan. 23 struck down an affirmative
action plan in Richmond, Va., that set aside 30 percent of all
public works contracts for minority-owned businesses.
   In that decision, the court made it more difficult for local and
state governments to adopt affirmative action plans that feature
strict racial quotas.
   The justices already have under study, and are expected to decide
by July, an affirmative action case involving minority promotions in
the Birmingham, Ala., Fire Department.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last December that
the South Bend plan amounted to unlawful reverse discrimination
because it was based solely on a disparity between the percentage of
minorities in the city's population and minorities in the police and
fire departments.
   Such statistical evidence is too generalized to warrant depriving
qualified whites of jobs, the appeals court said.
   ``The ax falls because the statistical comparison upon which the
city based its plan focused not on the relevant qualified area labor
pool but on general population statistics,'' the appeals court said.
   South Bend officials, in developing a voluntary affirmative
action program in 1979, noted that the city's minority population
was 14 percent while blacks and Hispanics held only 5.3 percent of
the fire department jobs.
   The plan was aimed at raising the minority composition of the
firefighting force to equal the minority make-up of the city within
five years.
   The city hired four minority applicants to the fire department
and one white in November 1980. All passed a qualifying test.
   Timothy Janowiak placed second on the list of white applicants.
He accused the city of racial discrimination when he was not hired.
   The 7th Circuit court ruled previously that Janowiak was the
victim of illegal bias. But that ruling was set aside last year by
the Supreme Court, which then ordered the appeals court to restudy
the case in light of recent affirmative action rulings by the
justices.
   The 7th Circuit court reaffirmed its previous ruling after the
new review.
   The appeals court noted that the high court last year upheld the
promotion of a woman to a county transportation job in California
over a marginally better-qualified man.
   But the appeals court said that case is distinct in key respects
from the South Bend plan for giving preferential treatment to
minorities.
   The appeals court said that in the California case there was a
``manifest imbalance'' between the number of women employed by the
county in skilled craft positions and the number of women in the
local labor pool of skilled craft workers.
   ``What constitutes a manifest imbalance ... remains unclear,''
the appeals court said.
   But it said that in any event, South Bend officials did not focus
on the relevant qualified area labor pool _ but rather on the
general city minority population _ in adopting an affirmative action
plan.
   ``South Bend's voluntary affirmative action plan, therefore,
fails to pass (legal) muster,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is South Bend vs. Janowiak, 87-1754.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An oil newsletter reported Monday that six
non-members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
will cut production by 180,000 barrels a day in the second quarter
of 1989 to help stabilize oil prices.
   The non-OPEC producers had agreed on cuts at a one-day meeting in
London Feb. 21 but amounts were not disclosed.
   The Middle East Economic Survey reported the six countries' and
barrel-per-day cuts are: Mexico 68,000; China 31,000; Oman 28,000;
Egypt 24,000; North Yemen 20,000; and Malaysia 17,000.
   ``However, a question mark still hangs over the biggest fish of
all _ the Soviet Union,'' the newsletter said. It said the USSR,
with other countries, agreed to go back to its authorities to
determine its contribution to the cuts.
   MEES said the Soviet Union told the London meeting it shared the
philosophy of cuts and ``might announce some measures next week.''
   It said that Angola and Columbia, which were involved in
expansion plans, agreed to freeze exports at current levels and that
Norway is sticking to its previously announced OPEC-support policy
of curbing production at 7.5 percent below originally planned
capacity.
   The non-OPEC producers cuts' are unconditional and not dependent
on any reciprocal action by the 13 OPEC members who set new
production ceilings last November to stem a fall in oil prices.

   William Clay Ford, the last member of Ford Motor
Co.'s founding family in a top-level executive post, may announce
his retirement within the next two weeks, according to a published
report Monday.
   The retirement of the last living grandson of founder Henry Ford
as vice chairman would leave the company without a family member in
a high-ranking executive position for the first time in history, The
Wall Street Journal reported.
   ``It's a speculative story, and we have nothing to say about
it,'' Ford Motor Co. spokesman Tom Foote said Monday.
   Announcement of the retirement may come at the company's March 9
board meeting, the newspaper said.
   William Clay Ford will be 64 years old March 14. The newspaper
said he likely will retire for personal and health reasons.
   Ford talked about retiring while recuperating last April from
heart surgery. ``Next February is 40 years (with Ford), and I think
that's a pretty good round number to quit on,'' Ford, owner of the
National Football League Detroit Lions, told sportswriters during
the NFL's player draft.
   The Wall Street Journal said Ford will remain as a director and
as chairman of the board's finance committee. Family members control
40 percent of the company's voting stock, and William Clay Ford is
the largest individual shareholder.
   His son, William Clay Ford Jr., 31, and nephew Edsel B. Ford II,
40, are middle managers at Ford. While Chairman Donald Petersen has
said promotions should be based solely on merit, the Ford family
would like one of its own in a high post.
   ``I don't think CEO is necessary, but I do think there ought to
be a Ford in some clearly visible management spot,'' William Clay
Ford recently told Fortune magazine.

   Grain and soybean futures prices dipped slightly

   The number of working oil and gas rigs fell by
nine to 757 this week, after turning in a good performance last
week, Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   Last week, the count rose by 20 to total 766. A year ago, the
count was 983, Baker Hughes said in its weekly report Monday.
   Baker Hughes economist Ike Kerridge said the count usually drops
off during late December through late March or early April.
   The rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for
oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas saw the biggest decline
with 14; followed by Louisiana and New Mexico, five each; Ohio and
Pennsylvania, three each; Kansas, two; and California, Colorado,
Michigan and Oklahoma, one each.
   Wyoming and North Dakota saw the only increases with rises of
four and three, respectively.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether an Illinois insurance company may sue in federal court to
challenge a Texas man's worker compensation award.
   The justices said they will use the case to decide whether worker
compensation insurers can get into federal court with such
challenges when the employer they insure is based in the same state
as the allegedly injured employee.
   Northbrook National Insurance Co., based in Illinois, is the
insurer for Whitmore Line Clearance Inc. in Texas.
   In 1987, Northbrook sued in federal court in Texas over an award
made to Larry W. Brewer for injuries allegedly suffered while
working for Whitmore.
   Legal papers submitted to the high court did not describe
Brewer's work or his injuries, or the size of the award he won. The
legal documents also did not state in what Texas city Whitmore is
based.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Brown in Paris, Texas, dismissed the
case after ruling that he lacked the jurisdiction to hear it.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Brown's ruling last
Sept. 13. The appeals court said Northbrook could get into federal
court, under a doctrine called ``diversity jurisdiction,'' only if
Whitmore were based in a state other than that where Brewer resided.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the insurance company
said other federal appeals courts have not restricted federal court
access in that way.
   The case is Northbrook National Insurance vs. Brewer, 88-995.

   Grand Metropolitan PLC said Monday it is
reorganizing operations following the $5.7 billion acquisition of
Pillsbury Inc. last year.
   A new unit called Grand Metropolitan Foods Group Europe, with
annual sales expected to be about $2.5 billion, will hold
Pillsbury's European food interests as well as the non-dairy
operations of Grand Met's Express Foods, the company said.
   The businesses are spread throughout Britain, France, Spain, West
Germany and the Netherlands.
   Grand Met will manage its remaining food operations outside the
United States, which are mainly dairy interests, under the Express
Foods Group (International) umbrella.
   A new unit called Pillsbury International, based in the United
States, will run the food interests of Pillsbury in Canada, Latin
America and the Far East. Pillsbury International is expected to
have annual sales of about $500 million.
   Ian Martin, head of Grand Met's food sector, said Monday that the
company believes Pillsbury brands such as Green Giant and Burger
King have strong international potential.

on the development of these brands as part of our strategy to
strengthen our position as a major world food company,'' Martin said.

<TEXT>
   A team of Venezuelan negotiators
traveled to Washington to sign a letter of intent with the
International Monetary Fund for a $1.5 billion bridge loan to
bolster the country's troubled economy.
   The loan is intended to back up economic reforms begun by the
government of President Carlos Andres Perez, who inherited a largely
bankrupt state-subsidized economy crippled by falling oil prices and
a $33 billion dollar foreign debt _ the fourth largest in Latin
America.
   Central Bank President Pedro Tinoco, among the negotiators who
left Caracas late Sunday, told the El Nacional newspaper that he
could sign the letter with IMF by Tuesday.
   Venezuela also is seeking short-term loans from the U.S. Federal
Reserve and the Central Bank of Spain worth $1.1 billion, contingent
on the signing of the letter of intent with the IMF, according to
banking sources.
   The World Bank also is prepared to provide money to back up the
reforms, according to representatives in Caracas last week. They
refused to discuss a specific sum.

   The stock market showed no clear trend today in a
sluggish session after last week's selloff.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 79.28 points last
week, recovered 1.78 to 2,247.32 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 522 up, 811 down and
537 unchanged.
   The market's slide last week came amid signs of increasing
inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.
   The bank prime lending rate rose for the second time this month,
and the Federal Reserve raised its discount rate.
   Analysts said that combination of events challenged widely held
assumptions among investors that the Fed had a strong hold in its
effort to restrain inflation, and that interest rates were near a
peak.
   Now, brokers said, many market participants are questioning how
much higher inflation and interest rates might go, and what effects
they might have on economic growth in the months ahead.
   U.S. Shoe tumbled 5~ to 19~. Traders' expectations of a possible
takeover or other transaction were chilled by news that the company
agreed to sell its footwear division to a group headed by Merrill
Lynch Capital Partners Inc.
   Blue chips attracting some buyers included International Business
Machines, up { at 121|; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up ] at 30[;
Texaco, up } at 51, and General Electric, up } at 46.
   Liz Claiborne dropped 1[ to 17 as the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market. The company's founders, Arthur and
Elisabeth Claiborne Ortenberg, announced plans to retire in June.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .03 to 161.75. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off .74 at 320.75.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 95.13 million shares with two

   The U.S. dollar fell against most major currencies
Monday in busy European trading marked by strong interest in the
West German currency.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the Deutsche mark firmed amid
continued speculation that the Bundesbank, the West German central
bank, would raise interest rates. The bank has a council meeting
scheduled for Thursday.
   Interest in the mark, coupled with worries over the British
economy, combined to hurt the pound despite repeated intervention by
the Bank of England.
   On the whole, interest in the dollar was dampened by active
trading in the mark and sterling.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7440 dollars, less expensive
for buyers than $1.7520 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Friday: 1.8150 West
German marks, down from 1.8270; 1.5495 Swiss francs, down from
1.5602; 6.1775 French francs, down from 6.2265; 2.0490 Dutch
guilderslire, down from
1,350.00; and 1.2025 Canadian dollars, up from 1.9990.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 126.00 yen, down 0.29 yen from Thursday's
close. Japanese financial markets were closed Friday because of the
state funeral of Emperor Hirohito. Later, in London, it was quoted
at 126.35 yen.
   Bullion dealers said the dollar's softness nudged gold prices
higher, but that each time gold moves up to the $391-an ounce level
profit-taking brings it back down.
   Gold traded late in London at a bid price of $389.00 a troy
ounce, down from $390.20 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $390.25, up from $389.00 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.61 to close at a bid $392.94
an ounce.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.93 a troy ounce,
down from Friday's $6.04.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Declines 1 Percent In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>For release after 6:30 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction starts declined 1 percent in
the fourth quarter compared with the same period of 1987 and the
apartment market remained especially weak, according to a private
report Monday.
   For all of 1988, construction was begun on 9 percent fewer
dwelling units than in 1987, F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill
Information Services Co. said. Housing starts declined 14 percent in
1987 from 1986.
   ``The stability of single-family home building over the past few
years stands in sharp contrast to the virtual collapse of apartment
construction,'' George A. Christie, chief economist of F.W. Dodge,
said in a written statement.
   Single-family home construction fell 7 percent over the two years
from 1986 to 1988, to 1.01 million units, while multi-family
dwelling construction plummeted 41 percent to 448,000 units over the
same period, Christie said.
   Housing starts reached their peak of the decade at 1.85 million
units in 1986 before falling to 1.59 million in 1987 and 1.46
million in 1988.
   Apartment construction was stimulated beyond demand by tax
incentives in the mid-1980s and vacancies remain high, Christie said.
   Construction of one-family houses has remained stable at 1
million to 1.1 million a year for the past three years, he said.
   This year, higher interest rates should hurt the single-family
housing market more than the apartment market, he said.
   The California housing market was stimulated in 1988 by
developers' rushing to beat no-growth initiatives on the state
ballot, Christie said. The initiatives were defeated.
   Leading the nation in housing starts in the fourth quarter was
the Los Angeles-Long Beach are, at 10,473 units, up 2 percent over
the 1987 fourth quarter.
   Rounding out the top 10 were Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif.,
9,449, up 15 percent; Atlanta, 9,316 units, down 3 percent;
Washington, 9,306, down 27 percent; Philadelphia, 6,072, down 1
percent; Chicago, 6,058, up 7 percent; Las Vegas, 5,469, up 115
percent; Seattle, 5,467, down 19 percent; West Palm Beach-Boca
Raton-Delray Beach, Fla., 5,442, up 19 percent; and Detroit, 5,134,
down 2 percent.
   For 1988 as a whole, the top 10 were: Riverside-San Bernardino,
51,795, up 22 percent; Washington, 49,300, down 10 percent; Los
Angeles-Long Beach, 45,177, down 11 percent; Atlanta, 42,386, down 8
percent; Philadelphia, 25,048, up 4 percent; Chicago, 24,830, down
17 percent; Detroit, 24,147, down 5 percent; Seattle, 22,823, up 7
percent; San Diego, 21,609, down 20 percent; and Phoenix, 21,412,
down 21 percent.

   Grain and soybean futures prices declined Monday
at the Chicago Board of Trade, but analysts said supportive
fundamentals helped temper losses.
   Farmer selling of corn and soybeans picked up steam over the
weekend and helped pressure prices, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Traders were further discouraged from buying by the notion that a
selloff is due after the markets' strong gains last week, he said.
   In the wheat pit, traders sold after a rumored sale of export
bonus wheat to the Chinese on Friday failed to materialize.
   But anticipation that a deal with China still may be in the
works, and expectations that the Soviet Union may make a bid on
corn, helped curb the decline in those pits, Lespinasse said.
   Weather is playing a supporting role, and the slightest hint of
another dry spring could send prices soaring, he said.
   ``All we need is a weather scare for the market to respond''
because of a lack of commodity reserves following last year's
drought, Lespinasse said.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 3 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in March at $4.32{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents lower to
{ cent higher, with March at $2.69} a bushel; oats were 3\ cents to
6} cents lower, with March at $1.99{ a bushel; and soybeans were 4{
cents lower to 1{ cents higher, with March at $7.56{ a bushel.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United States Shoe Corp. announced Monday it
will sell its footwear division, its name and its Cincinnati
headquarters to a management-led group for $422.5 million in cash.
   The purchase excludes U.S. Shoe's Cincinnati-based LensCrafters
division, which operates retail eyeglass stores, or the women's
apparel retail division, based in Enfield, Conn.
   Key executives of U.S. Shoe's footwear division, including Howard
Platt, a company executive vice president who is president of the
footwear division, are leaders in the purchasing group, U.S. Shoe
announced.
   The deal involves the footwear division, U.S. Shoe's Cincinnati
headquarters and its major footwear distribution center in
Cincinnati. U.S. Shoe said it will surrender its name to the new
company and choose another name more suited to its remaining
businesses.
   The transaction is to be concluded within 90 days. U.S. Shoe's
board of directors said it plans to use some of the proceeds of the
sale to raise the dividend on the stock to $1 this year from 46
cents.
   The footwear division makes, imports and sells footwear, and
operates about 500 retail stores and leased departments. The
division sells boots through its Texas Boot and Wrangler Boot
divisions, and markets women's footwear lines Amalfi, Bandolino,
Calvin Klein, Capezio, Cobbie, David Evins, Easy Spirit, Evan
Picone, Garolini, Innovations, Joyce, Liz Claiborne, Pappagallo, Red
Cross Shoes and Selby.
   The company said it expects the net proceeds will total $390
million, after taxes and expenses, and is subject to possible
adjustments of the purchase price before the transaction is closed.
   Up to $50 million of the proceeds will be used to pay off
long-term debts, U.S. Shoe officials said.
   Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc., an affiliate of Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets, is leading the investment group and has
provided commitments for $160 million of equity and subordinated
debt financing for the transaction, U.S. Shoe said.
   Philip G. Barach, chairman and chief executive officer of U.S.
Shoe, said the sale results from an overall review the company
announced last August to explore ways it could increase corporate
value to the shareholders.
   ``As part of this process, approximately 80 parties worldwide
were contacted in an effort to solicit offers for all of U.S. Shoe
or for any of its businesses,'' he said.
   Barach said no prospective buyer wanted to acquire all of U.S.
Shoe or made an acceptable offer for the women's apparel division.
Several bidders made offers for the LensCrafters division, but it
was retained in part because of its strong potential for growth, he
said.
   U.S. Shoe's board has approved an accelerated expansion of the
LensCrafters division in fiscal 1989 to 75 stores, rather than the
30 earlier planned, Barach said.
   U.S. Shoe plans to lease its headquarters offices from the
purchasing company. Both companies will share certain services and
will remain in Cincinnati, officials said.

<TEXT>
   Japan has decided to alter its monitoring of
overseas computer chip prices, one of the key provisions of a
semiconductor agreement between it and the United States, an
official said Monday.
   Under the pact, reached in 1985, Japan pledged it would monitor
the prices of Japanese memory chips sold in third countries as a
means of discouraging their resale in the United States at cheap
prices.
   The agreement resulted from a series of complaints by U.S.
semiconductor makers that Japanese companies had sold memory chips
in the United States below their fair market price, a practice known
as dumping.
   The monitoring provision has been sharply criticized by European
countries, which charged it regulated prices in other nations and
therefore violated the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, an international trade organization.
   In a ruling last March, the GATT said the European complaint was
valid.
   ``The third-country monitoring is not consistent with the GATT,
so we will have to modify the agreement,'' said Taizo Nakatomi, an
official in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
   He said a high ministry official, Tetsu Mizuno, left for
Washington on Sunday to discuss a modification of the pact with U.S.
trade officials.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper, reported that
Mizuno will seek U.S. consent to discontinue the third-country
monitoring. But Nakatomi said Mizuno had no concrete position and
would try to reach a compromise with the United States on how to
change the provision.
   ``Under the arrangement with the United States, we have an
obligation to monitor prices and sales. But the European Community
is saying that we have to completely modify the provision. That's a
dilemma for us,'' Nakatomi said.
   He said the Japanese government hoped to find a ``middle ground
between the two extremes.''
   In the bilateral semiconductor agreement, Japan also pledged to
set a ``fair price'' for exports of certain key memory chips to the
United States, establish a ``supply and demand forecast committee''
intended to stabilize prices and supply of memory chips, and
increase the sales of U.S.-made semiconductors in Japan.
   In April 1987, the United States imposed $300 million in tariffs
on Japan as a penalty for having allegedly violated the agreement by
continuing to dump memory chips and reneging on the pledge to
improve market access.
   Two months later, the United States reduced the penalties by $135
million after ruling that Japanese makers had stopped dumping,
leaving $165 million still in effect because of the market share
issue.
   Japan claims it has removed market restrictions and U.S.
companies must try harder if they want to increase their sales in
Japan.
   European countries are currently negotiating a separate
semiconductor pact with Japan that would regulate prices of
Japanese-made memory chips in Europe but not in other nations, news
reports say.
   The agreement also would not include any pledge by Japan to
increase sales of European chips inside Japan, the economic weekly
Japan Economic Journal reported.

<TEXT>
   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange fell
substantially on Monday as dealers awaited January trade figures.
   Fears of higher interest rates contributed to the negative
feeling, heightened by further steep declines in the British
currency.
   Nervousness before Wednesday's trade report for January kept many
institutional investors on the sidelines during Monday's session,
dealers said.
   At the close the FT-SE 100-share index was down 22.8 points, or
1.12 percent at 1996.7. The late afternoon rally came as Wall Street
moved slightly into positive territory after a weak start.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was down 19.2 points
at 1644.2. The Financial Times 500 share index fell 11.9 points to
1,138.05.
   Trading activity was light. According to stock exchange figures,
413.8 million shares changed hands. But dealers said the figure was
not representative, as new reporting rules that took effect Monday
allowed market makers to report trades of more than 100,000 pounds
on the following day.

   The dollar strengthened against all major
currencies in moderate trading Monday after ending weaker overseas.
   Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold was bid at $386.50 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EST, down $2.50 from
Friday's late bid.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's turnaround domestically
to firmer short-term U.S. interest rates, particularly the federal
funds rates, the interest on overnight loans between banks. The fed
funds rate was trading at 9~ percent, up from 913-16 percent Friday.
   Short-term rates rose sharply on Friday as the Federal Reserve
raised its discount rate by a half percentage point to 7 percent due
to concerns about inflation.
   Higher interest rates tend to support a currency.
   Also lending support to the dollar Monday was belief that the
West German Bundesbank won't be raising its short-term interest
rates when it meets on Thursday, explained James T. McGroarty, a
vice president at Discount Corp. in New York.
   Speculation of such a hike had pushed the West German mark higher
overseas at the expense of the British pound, traders said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 126.00 yen, down 0.29 yen from Thursday's
close. Japanese financial markets were closed Friday because of the
state funeral of Emperor Hirohito.
   The dollar was quoted at 126.35 yen in London, and 126.78 yen in
New York, up from 126.125 yen late Friday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7440, less expensive for
buyers than $1.7520 late Friday. Sterling fetched $1.7380 in New
York, down from $1.7530 Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's
levels, included: 1.82435 West German marks, up from 1.81875; 1.5530
Swiss francs, up from 1.55245; 1.20325 Canadian dollars, up from
1.19825; 6.2070 French francs, up from 6.1940; and 1,343.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,342.50 Italian.
   Late dollar rates in Europe included: 1.8150 West German marks,
down from 1.8270; 1.5495 Swiss francs, down from 1.5602; 6.1775
French francs, down from 6.2265; 2.0490 Dutch guilders, down from
2.0630; 1.2025 Canadian dollars, up from 1.9990; and 1,339.62
Italian lire, down from 1,350.00.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $387.30 a troy ounce, down $3.80 from Friday's
settlement price.
   Gold traded late in London at a bid price of $389.00 an ounce,
down from $390.20 bid late Friday. In Zurich, the bid price was
$390.25, up from $389.00 bid late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.61 to close at a bid $392.94
an ounce.
   Silver bullion prices declined. On New York's Comex, silver for
current deliver fell to $5.845 a troy ounce from $5.923 late Friday.
In London, silver fell to $5.93 an ounce from Friday's $6.04.

<TEXT>
   After more than two months of negotiations,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and federal securities regulators are
nearing an agreement aimed at settling the largest Wall Street fraud
case in history, sources said Monday.
   The sides are said to be still haggling over whether the
investment firm must move part of its high-profile and big-money
``junk bond'' financing division run by trader Michael Milken from
Beverly Hills, Calif., to New York.
   But Drexel has agreed to tighten internal controls to prevent
future securities law violations, hire a consultant to monitor the
changes and increase the size of its board, sources familiar with
the negotiations said.
   Drexel already has agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts
and pay a record $650 million to settle criminal securities fraud
charges with the Justice Department.
   But the plea deal cannot proceed until the firm resolves civil
claims brought last September by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the federal regulatory agency that polices U.S.
financial markets.
   The SEC accused Drexel and four officials, including Milken, of
insider trading, defrauding clients, securities fraud, stock
manipulation and other violations in September.
   Drexel and the SEC have been negotiating regularly since
December, when the U.S. attorney's office in New York announced the
criminal plea bargain that followed a massive two-year probe based
on information supplied by imprisoned speculator Ivan Boesky.
   The SEC settlement, which sources said should be completed within
two weeks, must be approved by a federal court judge.
   Drexel then would enter a guilty plea to the felony counts and
immediately fork over $300 million in fines to the government.
Another $350 million would be placed in an account to cover
potential lawsuits by investors.
   One source close to the negotiations, who asked not to be
identified, said the sides were working on language and details of
the agreement although the status of Drexel's West Coast division
remained unresolved.
   The parties now apparently have agreed that Drexel will move a
portion of the California business _ either its equity trading or
convertible securities operations _ back to New York, where the
nation's fifth-largest securities firm is based, the source said.
   Drexel opposed shifting the entire California operation, as the
SEC originally demanded. The operation has more than 500 employees
and accounts for much of the firm's profits, and Drexel argued that
a relocation would cripple the company and severely hurt West Coast
financial markets.
   The firm reportedly has agreed to install an internal rules
compliance system that will include tighter oversight of all
operations, and add two to four people from outside the company to
its 22-member board.
   The future of high-yield bond trader Milken, who organized the
multibillion-dollar California operations in the late 1970s, has not
played a role in the SEC settlement negotiations, one source said.
   But Milken and potenial lawsuits against Drexel could ensure that
the landmark securities fraud case _ which the company says has cost
it more than $175 million, including $30 million for photocopying
legal documents _ will continue long after the SEC settlement is
signed and delivered.
   The government this week was expected to reply in court papers to
a motion from Milken challenging the criminal settlement, which
requires Drexel to terminate Milken and withhold his
multimillion-dollar pay.
   Even if his motion fails, Milken, who is expected to be indicted
soon on fraud and racketeering charges but so far has not been
charged in connection with the case, could sue Drexel to get his
1988 pay, which his attorneys said would ``greatly exceed'' $100
million.
   Drexel reportedly is setting aside the amount of Milken's
compensation, most of which is a bonus linked to performance, in
case it later must pay him. Milken has charged the settlement
violates his rights.
   Drexel also has established legal teams in several states and
made contacts in others anticipating a barrage of lawsuits by state
and local securities regulators and investors connected with deals
named in the charges against Drexel.
   In addition, Drexel will announce in about three weeks whether it
is hiring former SEC Chairman John Shad, now the U.S. ambassador to
the Netherlands, as its new chairman, sources said. Earlier this
year Shad confirmed he was considering a Drexel offer.

<HEAD>Coastal Leaves $2.6 Billion Offer for Texas Eastern on Table</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coastal Corp. said Monday its $2.6 billion cash
offer for Texas Eastern Corp. will remain on the table pending the
completion of a competing $3.2 billion tender offer for the company
by Panhandle Eastern Corp.
   Coastal, however, said it does not intend to increase its
$42-per-share offer to a level that would be competitive with
Panhandle Eastern's $53-per-share bid for 80 percent of the
Houston-based natural gas company.
   Coastal currently owns about 2.5 million of Texas Eastern's 60.8
million common shares and said it may sell some or all of these
holdings in the open market or in private transactions.
   Coastal's offer, which began Jan. 17, was extended last week and
is scheduled to expire at midnight March 10. Panhandle Eastern's
offer expires at midnight March 20. Both are natural gas companies
headquartered in Houston.
   Coastal said in a statement that its intentions are based on
information currently available to it and could change if it
receives additional relevant information or as a result of its
ongoing review of the situation.
   Texas Eastern's board of directors rejected Coastal's bid calling
the offer inadequate.
   Panhandle Eastern's deal, which the Texas Eastern board approved,
called for the company to buy 80 percent of the company. Shares not
purchased under the cash offer would be exchanged for Panhandle
Eastern stock at the same $53 a share.
   The combination of Texas Eastern and Panhandle Eastern would
create a 27,000-mile pipeline system, while Texas Eastern-Coastal
merger would create a 30,000-mile network. Both would be the
second-largest in total miles behind Enron Corp., also of Houston,
that has 38,000 miles of pipe.

   A group led by Malaysian investor Vincent Tan on
Monday announced a $33-a-share tender offer for SSMC Inc., the
Shelton Conn.-based maker of Singer sewing machines.
   The group, Berjaya Corp. (Malaysia) Berhad, already owns slightly
less than 10 percent of SSMC's 7.1 million outstanding shares,
giving its tender offer for the remaining stock a value of about

   Stock prices turned mixed Monday and trading
tailed off to its slowest pace in six weeks in the aftermath of the
market's recent selloff.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen 79.28
points last week, recovered 4.82 to 2,250.36.
   But declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
606 up, 800 down and 521 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 139.90 million
shares, down from 160.68 million Friday and the lightest total since
a 117.38 million-share day on Jan. 16.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 167.66 million shares.
   The market's slide last week came amid signs of increasing
inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.
   The bank prime lending rate rose for the second time this month,
and the Federal Reserve raised its discount rate.
   Analysts said that combination of events challenged widely held
assumptions among investors that the Fed had a strong hold in its
effort to restrain inflation, and that interest rates were near a
peak.
   Now, brokers said, many market participants are questioning how
much higher inflation and interest rates might go, and what effects
they might have on economic growth in the months ahead.
   Blue chips attracting some ``bargain hunting''buyers included
International Business Machines, up { at 121|; American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up ] at 30[; Texaco, up } at 51, and General Electric, up
} at 46.
   U.S. Shoe tumbled 5} to 20. Traders' expectations of a possible

   Columbia Pictures gained 1[ to 15} on revived takeover

   Liz Claiborne fell 1 to 17[ as one of the most active issues in

   Energy futures prices finished higher Monday but
below the day's best levels as the recent rally began losing
momentum.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for March
delivery rose 0.56 cent to end the day at 50.67 cents a gallon.
March heating oil gained 0.92 cent to settle at 52.65 cents a gallon.
   ``The products did perform pretty well today,'' said John
Rowland, a trader at E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc. But he
added, ``The markets are slowing down a little bit.''
   He said the performance Monday largely reflected brokers buying
before the March contracts expire on Tuesday.
   Crude oil prices also strengthened. The April contract for the
benchmark U.S. crude, West Texas Intermediate, gained 7 cents to
finish at $18.14 a barrel.
   The temporary shutdown of a pumping station on the trans-Alaska
oil pipeline, which halted the flow of oil in the line for several
hours during the weekend, had little, if any, effect on crude
prices, dealers said.
   One of three pumps at Pump Station One failed Saturday when snow
got into its ventilation system, melted and caused an electrical
short, said Tom Brennan, spokesman for the Alyeska Pipeline Service
Co.
   The station's other two pumps failed that night when air intakes
froze shut on their booster pumps, he said.

<HEAD>Cotton Prices Surge As Pakistan Curbs Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cotton futures prices surged Monday at the New York Cotton
Exchange, fueled by reports that Pakistan is halting all new export
sales and by rumors of purchases by China.
   On other markets, declines were posted in grains, soybeans,
precious metals and cattle prices, while hog prices were mostly
lower and pork bellies were mostly higher. Oil prices were mixed.
   News out of Pakistan, a leading cotton producer and exporter
behind China, the United States, Soviet Union and India, was the
major factor in the cotton pit, said Ed Whitten, an analyst with New
York-based Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   ``Pakistan has issued an edict to not allow any more exports,''
he said, adding that it is unclear if the move is temporary or
permanent.
   The measure affects new sales, and ``is indicative of a fact that
the world is running out of extra cotton for export,'' Whitten said.
``If there are any buyers ... they will have to come to the United
States. If they come to us, they'll have to pay our price.''
   Rumors of Chinese purchases of U.S. cotton also supported prices,
he said.
   Cotton prices settled .67 cent to 1.60 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in March at 59.19 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices dipped at the Chicago Board of
Trade, but analysts said supportive fundamentals helped temper
losses.
   Farmer selling of corn and soybeans increased slightly over the
weekend and helped pressure prices, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
for Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. in Chicago.
   Buying was further discouraged by the notion that a selloff is
due after the markets' strong gains last week, he said.
   In the wheat pit, traders sold after a rumored sale of export
bonus wheat to the Chinese on Friday failed to materialize.
   But anticipation that a deal with China still may be on tap, and
expectations that the Soviet Union may make a bid on corn helped
curb the decline in those pits, Lespinasse said.
   Wheat prices settled { cent to 2{ cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in March at $4.32{ a bushel; corn settled 1{ cents
lower to { cent higher, with the March contract at $2.70 a bushel;
oats were 3\ cents to 7 cents lower, with March at $1.99\ a bushel;
and soybeans were 3} cents lower to 1} cents higher, with March at
$7.57\ a bushel.
   Credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve late last week,
indicative of its ``commitment to an anti-inflationary stance,''
continued to pressure gold and silver prices at the New York
Commodity Exchange, said George Anagnos, a New York analyst with
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   The Federal Reserve on Friday raised its discount rate, the loan
fee it charges to member banks, from 6.5 percent to 7 percent, in a
move designed to curb inflation by slowing down the economy.
   ``It's not an environment where investors are actively seeking to
add to their portfolio of precious metals,'' Anagnos said.
   Gold prices settled $2.80 to $3 lower, with the contract for
delivery in March at $387.30 a troy ounce; silver prices were 4.7
cents to 8 cents lower, with March at $5.85 a troy ounce.
   Cattle prices dipped, hog prices were mostly lower and pork
bellies were mostly higher in lackluster trading at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Pork belly prices remained firm despite the Agriculture
Department's monthly cold storage report, released after the close
of trading Friday, indicating frozen pork belly supplies were
slightly greater than had been expected.
   Anticipation of the report sparked a selloff Friday, which in
turn encouraged short-covering Monday, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .40 cent lower, with the
contract for delivery in April at 78.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were .27 cent to .70 cent lower, with the March contract at 82.92
cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .05 cent higher,
with April at 43.47 cents a pound; and pork bellies settled .18 cent
lower to 1.12 cents higher, with March at 37.82 cents a pound.
   Crude oil prices were mixed in trading at the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Crude oil settled 13 cents lower to 7 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in April at $18.14 a barrel; heating oil was
.22 cent lower to .92 cent higher, with March at 52.65 cents a
gallon; unleaded gas was .20 cent lower to .56 cent higher, with
March at 50.67 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>More Foreign Steel Dumping without Restraints, Executive Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign companies are ready to resume large-scale
steel dumping on the United States if voluntary restraints on the
amount of imported steel are not continued this fall, the president
of the USS Division of USX Corp. said Monday.
   Thomas Graham said a 5-year renewal of the limits, wich expire
Sept. 30, is essential for the U.S. steel industry to continue its
2-year financial comeback.
   ``We can't afford to become giddy,'' he said. ``Two years of
profitability doesn't offset five years of losses.''
   Graham said the U.S. steel industry earned more than $2 billion
in 1988 and about $900 million the year before. But between 1982 and
1986, the industry lost $12 billion, an average of $2.4 billion
annually.
   The voluntary restraint agreement, which began in 1984, limits
the amount of imported finished steel to 18.5 percent of the U.S.
market, among other things. The American Institute for Imported
Steel said steel made overseas and shipped to the United States
accounts for about 17.7 percent of the market, below the current VRA
limit.
   Despite that, Graham said, the U.S. government must hold the line
on the amount of steel coming into the country.
   ``There's no doubt that foreign producers will revert to
large-scale dumping of heavily subsidized steel'' without a VRA
renewal, he said. ``We certainly can't tolerate a return to past
practices.''
   In the third quarter of 1984, shortly before the VRA began,
imported steel made up just more than 30 percent of the U.S. market.
   Graham's comments came during the opening day of the week-long
annual congress of the Society of Automotive Engineers.
   The imported steel association, which supports an elimination of
the VRA or a 2-year extension instead of five years, has claimed
that the limits reduce supply thereby increasing prices for U.S.
steel, something the domestic steelmakers like.
   But Graham dismissed that contention.
   ``It's not an issue of protectionism,'' he said. ``It's an issue
of legal trading practices.''
   Graham also said Pittsburgh-based USS is prepared to file legal
papers if the Bush administration rejects a VRA extension.
   ``We need enabling legislation from Congress before the Bush
administration has the ability to act,'' he said. ``We see ourselves
as prudent businessmen.''
   He declined to say when any legal moves may be taken, adding that
an earlier agreement barred the industry from filing trade
litigation while a VRA was in effect.

<TEXT>
   National Semiconductor Corp. said
Monday it is selling its mainframe computer business to Hitachi Ltd.
and a unit of General Motors Corp. for $398 million, a deal one
analyst called ``a great move'' for National.
   In announcing the sale, the chip maker said it broke off a
tentative agreement with a Dutch company, Memorex Telex NV, for half
of National Advanced Systems.
   Hitachi, which will own 80 percent of the joint venture that is
buying National Advanced Systems, will gain a greater presence in
the U.S. mainframe market dominated by International Business
Machines Corp., analysts said.
   National Advanced Systems sells Hitachi's mainframe computers and
data-storage systems. The deal will tighten that relationship and
allow Hitachi greater flexibility in building the $900
million-a-year business.
   The GM unit, Dallas-based Electronic Data Systems Corp., also is
expected to become a stronger competitor to IBM and Digital
Equipment Corp. in helping companies assemble computer systems.
   ``From National's standpoint, it's a very positive move,'' said
John McManus of Thomas McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York. ``They
get all the money up front. I think it's a great move.''
   Jim Hammons, a computer industry analyst with the Sierra Group in
Tempe, Ariz., also said the deal was good for National Semiconductor
but wondered what it would do with all the money.
   ``National couldn't do anything with NAS,'' Hammons said. ``So
now that they've gotten rid of it, the question is what are they
going to do with the cash that they couldn't do with the company?''
   National Semiconductor spokeswoman Mary Coady said the money
would go toward the retirement of debt and working capital.
   National Semiconductor announced on Jan. 9 that it had signed a
letter of intent to sell a half-interest in National Advanced
Systems to Memorex Telex NV of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, for $250
million and 4 million shares of Memorex Telex stock. National
Semiconductor would have continued to own the rest.
   Complications in financing the deal arose and the letter of
intent expired earlier this month, freeing National Semiconductor to
consider other offers, said George Bragg, a spokesman for Memorex
Telex's U.S. subsidiary in Tulsa, Okla.
   Under the new deal, which is also subject to a definitive
agreement, National Advanced Systems is to be bought by a
joint-venture company created by Hitachi and GM's EDS unit.
   Hitachi will own 80 percent of the company and EDS will own 20
percent, Hitachi spokesman Osamu Naito said. He said the partners
will in turn sell the European portion of the business, which
accounts for less than half its revenue, to Comparex Information
Systems GmbH for an undisclosed price.
   Comparex, based in Mannheim, West Germany, is Hitachi's other
sales outlet for mainframe computers in Europe, Naito said.
   National Semiconductor has been selling off businesses to raise
cash to build up its core business of computer chips, which has been
losing money.
   The financing problem that spoiled the deal with the Dutch
company came when there was more difficulty than expected in having
National Advanced Systems raise $250 million in cash, which would
have been paid to National Semiconductor, Bragg said.
   He said Memorex Telex proposed other deals but could not match
the all-cash offer from Hitachi and EDS.
   National Advanced Systems is Hitachi's largest distributor of
mainframe computers that run the same programs as IBM's big
mainframes. It has 2,200 employees worldwide, including 1,200 in the
United States.
   ``We think it's a good situation for us,'' said Coady. ``I just
want to make it clear that we did not accept the Hitachi deal
because we thought it was a better deal, in a vaccuum. We continued
to negotiate with Memorex Telex well after the letter of intent had
expired.''
   A definitive agreement is expected by the end of March and the
deal should be closed by the end of April, Coady said. National
Semiconductor then would be pared down to about 35,000 employees
worldwide. The company announced 2,000 layoffs earlier this year.

   A federal appeals court Monday upheld a
judgment against Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd., which was found
to have infringed on two Corning Glass Works patents dealing with
optical fibers.
   The ruling by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington
affirms an October 1987 decision by U.S. District Judge William C.
Conner, who decided all Sumitomo optical-waveguide fibers made or
sold in the United States infringed on one or the other of two
Corning patents.
   Payment of damages and other relief to Corning will be determined
in a separate proceeding by the district court.
   Optical fibers are hair-thin strands of glass used to transmit
information by light. They are used extensively in long-distance
telephone lines.
   ``We believe this confirms the significance of the contribution
that Corning has made to this technology,'' said Corning's Jan H.
Suwinski. ``Furthermore, the decision should be well-received by
every company that invests to create new technology.''
   Sumitomo vice president Bob Swirbul said the decision in the
appeal was disappointing to the company and ``different from our
expectations.''
   The company has been prohibited since 1987 from manufacturing or
selling optical fiber strands but is allowed to sell fiber optic
cable, which contains many strands, Swirbul said.
   As such, he said, ``our current activities in our (fiber-optic)
division ... will not be affected'' by the judgment.
   Sumitomo's fiber-optic operations, which accounted for about 10
percent of U.S. demand in 1987, are located in Research Triangle
Park, N.C.

<HEAD>Stockbroker Corroborates Key Testimony in Stock Manipulation Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A stockbroker testified in the GAF Corp.
securities fraud trial Monday that he tried to fix the price of a
company stock, but contradicted a key government informant who said
the broker took some orders directly from GAF.
   James Melton, head trader for Jefferies &amp; Co., took the stand in
the first Wall Street fraud case to be heard by a jury, one month
after suffering a heart attack in Los Angeles that delayed his
testimony.
   Melton, 45, backed up the account of trader Boyd L. Jefferies,
who said in U.S. District Court earlier this month that GAF asked
him to inflate the stock price of Union Carbide Corp. to $22 a share
in October 1986.
   But under cross-examination, Melton contradicted Jefferies'
testimony that Melton pursued Carbide stock in early November 1986
under orders from GAF Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin, who was
indicted along with the company last July.
   ``I don't recall Mr. Sherwin ever telling me to do anything with
Union Carbide,'' Melton said.
   Jefferies had testified that his firm bought 190,000 Union
Carbide shares at Sherwin's request in two days in October as part
of the scheme.
   The purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximize
GAF's gain from the sale of its holding in Union Carbide after a
failed takeover attempt of the much larger chemical company. Wayne,
N.J.-based GAF sold about 5 million Carbide shares in November 1986
for $23 each.
   Melton said Jefferies ordered him to buy Union Carbide stock
through the New York Stock Exchange and keep it at a certain price,
and to report directly to Sherwin each day he traded the stock.
   He said some days he also bought stock through exchanges in Los
Angeles and San Francisco to support prices in New York.
   ``My mission was to close the stock at 22 (dollars) or higher,''
Melton testified under questioning from Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl
Loewenson Jr. He said he sometimes bought ``everything for sale.''
   ``I told Mr. Sherwin what I had done and the price (at which) it
had closed,'' Melton said. ``He said, `Thank you.'''
   The trial is in its second incarnation. U.S. District Judge Mary
Johnson Lowe ordered a mistrial on Jan. 10 four weeks into the case
after concluding prosecutors withheld a key piece of evidence from
the defense.
   Jefferies struck a plea bargain with government prosecutors in
1987 after he was implicated in the Wall Street insider trading
scandals with jailed speculator Ivan Boesky.
   Jefferies agreed to plea guilty to two securities law violations,
quit his brokerage firm and stay out of the securities business for
at least five years. He hasn't been sentenced.

<HEAD>Empire Seeks Nearly $1 Billion From FSLIC In Recapitalization Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DARREN DOPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators would contribute $905
million to Empire of America's recapitalization under a proposal
made by the troubled thrift Monday.
   The application to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
is a first of its kind, but industry observers said others will
follow.
   ``We've been predicting this would happen for some time,'' said
Douglas Faucette, an attorney for a coalition of banking interests.
``Unless executives are totally asleep at the helm, they'll all be
doing this.''
   If the request was approved by the FSLIC, the bank said it would
be able to raise an additional $670 million through private
investors and could return immediately to profitability.
   The recapitalization plan ``demonstrates a means whereby the cost
to taxpayers of the resolution of the entire thrift crisis could be
significantly reduced,'' Empire Chairman Paul Willax said.
   Empire, the nation's 12th-largest thrift with $11.3 billion in
assets, is asking the FSLIC for the cash as a replacement for
non-cash assistance the FSLIC gave Empire when it took over 13
failing savings and loans from 1981 to 1986.
   Although the bank is currently solvent, officials are afraid that
federal proposals to save the thrift industry will reduce the value
of its non-cash assistance. If that happened Empire would have
difficulty raising money to meet new capital requirements.
   ``This is not at all an act of desperation but rather an act of
anticipation,'' Willax said.
   The proposal shows the investment community still has confidence
in Empire, he said.
   Willax said the $670 million commitment of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., a New York investment firm, is the largest amount of private
money involved in the recapitalization of any thrift.
   In a statement issued by Drexel Burnam, senior vice president
Stephen Joseph called the Empire proposal ``an exciting, innovative
effort that will result in a strengthened institution.''
   Faucette, an attorney for Financial Assistance Inequity Coalition
in Washington, said Drexel Burnam's involvement was an indication
that the financial community has doubts about government proposals
to help the thrift industry.
   ``The feeling is that the government has gone and changed the
rules for insititutions like Empire and that this sort of thing (the
Empire plan) may be the only way out,'' he said.
   Faucette said, however, he doubted the federal officials would
approve of the idea.
   ``You can imagine the type of reception you'd get when you ask
for nearly a billion dollars,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal securities regulators have questioned MAI
Basic Four Inc. about possible violations of stock margin
requirements in its hostile bid for Prime Computer Inc., MAI Basic
confirmed Monday.
   The inquest comes after several Massachusetts congressmen pressed
the Securities and Exchange Commission to step up enforcement of
margin requirements, passed after the 1929 stock market crash to
limit borrowing for speculative purposes.
   ``We've had informal, cordial and cooperative discussions with
SEC staff,'' MAI Basic spokesman Peter Rosenthal said in a
statement. ``We've answered all of the questions they've asked of
us. And as we previously stated in our offering documents, we
believe our offer complies with all margin rules.''
   The SEC declined to comment on whether it was conducting a
preliminary inquiry or a full-scale investigation.
   David A. Smith, an aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said
the SEC began interviewing MAI officials last week.
   ``What I know is that there is an inquiry going on,'' he said.
``How intensive, I couldn't tell you.''
   MAI Basic, a Tustin, Calif.-based computer firm controlled by New
York investor Bennett S. LeBow, has offered $20 per share for Prime,
a much larger computer maker headquartered in Natick.
   In court documents, MAI said it would finance the takeover with
an $875 million corporate borrowing and $650 million in secured
loans. Under the margin rules, at least 50 percent of the $650
million must be secured by collateral, such as cash, tangible assets
or stock.
   ``They have put up stock, but the question is, what is the actual
value of the stock, and is it really secured by assets of MAI,''
said Howard Homonoff, an aide to Rep. Joseph Markey, D-Mass.
   U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone temporarily enjoined MAI's
bid last month, ruling that the firm had not adequately disclosed
its financial arrangements with the investment firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   A hearing in the case is scheduled Thursday at the 1st U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.
   Mazzone late last year said MAI's bid raised serious questions
about compliance with margin requirements. Following the judge's
comments, Frank, Markey and Kennedy wrote letters to the SEC and the
Federal Reserve Board urging stiffer application of the margin rules
in takeover battles.
   Aides to the Massachusetts congressmen said that despite the boom
in highly leveraged corporate takeovers, the SEC has not brought an
enforcement action on margin rules recently.

   The state's vegetable farmers surveyed heavy
losses in tomato, cucumber and potato crops Monday after a
record-setting cold snap, but an industry official predicted
shoppers will not face shortages.
   Wayne Crain, marketing-production manager for the Florida Fruit
and Vegetable Association, predicted that supermarket consumers
would see little loss of volume in popular vegetables such as
lettuce and tomatoes despite damage to winter and early spring crops.
   ``We still have plenty of product. We're still in the market,''
Crain said.
   Just north of the Florida border, Georgia peach growers reported
more than $9 million in losses from the cold. However, Tommy Irvin,
commissioner of the Georgia Department of Agriculture, said, ``It
seems right now we didn't come out hardly as bad as we first
appeared.''
   Florida's $1.3 billion citrus crop reportedly came through the
frosty weather Thursday, Friday and Saturday nearly unscathed. The
temperatures did not stay low enough long enough to affect fruit on
the trees.
   Citrus industry officials said it would be about two weeks before
they determine how the damage to early blooms and new growth would
affect next year's crop.
   But the state's $1.1 billion vegetable industry did not fare as
well.
   With vegetable losses undetermined, most industry leaders said it
was too early to tell what effect the freezing temperatures Thursday
through Saturday might have on consumer prices.
   ``There would have to be vast losses in all sectors before any
real impact is made at the retail level,'' Agriculture Commissioner
Doyle Conner said.
   Officials estimated the tomato crops were the hardest hit, with
half of the crop wiped out in the Ruskin-Palmetto area around St.
Petersburg, 25 percent to 35 percent of the crop lost in southwest
Florida around Naples and Immokalee and 10 percent of the crop
damaged in south Florida around Homestead.
   Tomatoes are the state's largest produce crop, valued at almost
$490 million in 1987, the latest figures available from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
   About 70 percent of the cucumbers were reported damaged, and
production was set back until May for most of the crop, which is
grown primarily in the southern part of the state at this time of
year.
   Spring potatoes in the Palatka-St. Augustine area in
north-central Florida were heavily damaged.
   There was lesser damage to corn, peppers, squash, watermelons and
leafy vegetables, mainly in north and central Florida.
   Crops along the East Coast were not badly affected.
   ``I just see a crazy, mixed-up spring marketing,'' Crain said.
``With replanting, everything (production) is being pushed back. And
with the weather moderating in the spring, we're going to see a lot
of crops overlapping.''
   Some of Florida's traditional late-winter crops also will be
overlapping with the same varieties from southeastern states, Texas
and the Southwest in April, May and June, he said.
   Mexico, which is a major competitor in tomatoes, peppers,
cucumbers, squash and eggplant, was hit hard by freezing
temperatures in January and its production is also way down.

   WPP Group PLC of London said Monday it has agreed
to buy PARG Public Affairs Resource Group of Toronto, one of
Canada's largest public affairs consulting and public opinion
research firms.
   WPP Group said the deal will make its Hill and Knowlton (Canada)
Ltd. subsidiary the largest public relations firm in Canada.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the companies said in a
statement that it included cash and stock and possible additional
payouts over the next five years.
   WPP Group, the parent of the J. Walter Thompson advertising
company, said it will combine the operations of the Canadian agency
with its Hill and Knowlton Inc., an international public relations
and public affairs firm based in New York.
   Under terms of the agreement, WPP said it plans to combine the
operations of three PARG subsidiaries _ Public Affairs
International, Decima Research and Public Affairs Communication
Management _ with those of Hill and Knowlton (Canada) Ltd.
   ``PARG brings new dimensions to our already sizeable public
relations services in Canada,'' said Robert L. Dilenschneider,
president and chief executive of Hill and Knowlton in New York.
   The expanded orgnaization will have revenue of about 25 million
Canadian dollars, or about $21 million, this year, the statement
said. It will employ about 200 people in offices in Toronto, Ottawa,
Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary.
   The fourth PARG unit, Government Research Corp. of Washington,
D.C., will become part of Hill and Knowlton's Washington office.

<HEAD>Infotechnology Agrees To Buy Remaining Shares Of Company Controlling
UPI</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infotechnology Inc. said Monday it had agreed to
buy the shares it does not already own in WNW Group Inc., which
controls the management of the news agency United Press
International.
   Infotech agreed to buy the WNW Group stake in exchange for nearly
2 million shares of restricted Infotech common stock.
   Completion of the deal is subject to completing necessary
documentation.
   ``We are pleased with the progress at UPI in its first year of
operation under WNW Group,'' Earl Brian, chairman of Infotech, said
in a statement.
   He said UPI will continue to operate independently, but that both
Infotechnology and UPI ``will benefit greatly from UPI's direct
interaction among Infotech companies.''
   The statement was released late Monday afternoon, and several
calls placed to Infotechnology for elaboration on the announcement
went unanswered.
   Paul Steinle, president of WNW Group, was quoted in the statement
as calling the deal a ``further vote of confidence in the future of
United Press International.''
   WNW Group, based in Washington, D.C., has managed UPI since
February 1988 under terms of an irrevocable proxy from controlling
UPI shareholder Mario Vazquez-Rana, a Mexican publisher.
   Infotechnology, based in New York, has interests in information
technology and invests in medical and scientific ventures. It also
owns the Financial News Network.
   UPI said it lost about $16 million in 1988 compared with a $25
million loss in 1987. Steinle has said he expects the 81-year-old
news agency to begin turning a profit by the end of 1989.

   The board of directors of Morton Thiokol Inc. on
Monday authorized management to proceed with a plan for a tax-free
spin-off of the company's commercial operations, officials said.
   The action will create a new company, Morton International Inc.,
consisting of specialty chemicals, air bag manufacturing and salt
businesses.
   The aerospace business, which manufactures the space shuttle
booster motor and strategic and tactical propulsion systems, will
continue to operate within the existing corporate entity, which will
be renamed Thiokol Corp.
   The transaction is expected to be finalized July 1, subject to an
Internal Revenue Service ruling that it is tax-free and to the
approval of stockholders, said company spokesman Tom Russell.
   Morton Thiokol stockholders will receive a share-for-share
distribution of Morton International stock, Russell said. Management
believes the stock of both companies will qualify for listing on the
New York Stock Exchange. The board will establish record and payment
dates for the stock distribution later.
   ``This move separates two businesses with distinct financial,
investment and operating characteristics so that each can adopt
strategies and pursue objectives appropriate to its specific
businesses,'' said Charles S. Locke, Morton Thiokol's chairman and
chief executive officer.
   ``The transaction will allow investors to evaluate better the
individual businesses and their future outlook, enhancing the
likelihood that the true value of each business will be properly
reflected,'' he said.
   Locke said the combined market values of the stocks of the two
companies may exceed the recent market value of Morton Thiokol stock.
   Morton Thiokol stock closed Monday at $40 in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading, unchanged from Friday's close.
   Locke said the combination of the specialty chemicals, inflatable
restraint systems, or air bags, and salt businesses will create a
company with fiscal year 1989 sales approaching $1.5 billion, assets
of $1.4 billion and over 8,000 employees.
   It is expected that Locke and S. Jay Stewart, president and chief
operating officer of Morton Thiokol, will be elected to those posts
at Morton International.
   Locke said Thiokol will be a company with approximately $1.1
billion in sales, assets of $800 million and more than 12,000
employees. Ed Garrison, group vice president for aerospace in Ogden,
Utah, is expected to be elected president and chief operating
officer, while a search for a chairman and chief executive officer
is anticipated.
   Russell said the action had nothing to do with the aerospace
group's $500 million redesign of the space shuttle booster in the
wake of the 1986 Challenger explosion.
   The redesigned booster, which corrected joint problems blamed for
the blast, has been used successfully on two shuttle flights in
recent months and will be used on several more.
   ``The shuttle program is in very good shape, we're very confident
of redesign,'' Russell said.
   He said the Chicago-based company was preparing to bid on a $2
billion-plus contract for 66 new flights sets of two boosters each
and 10 development motors.
   The company said that under the spin off, the combined dividends
initially paid by the two companies will equal the current Morton
Thiokol dividend.
   The company plans to redeem its 8~ percent debentures due in 1995
and 9| percent debentures due in 2000 prior to June 30, 1989.
   Although the business momentum and profitability outlook for
Morton Thiokol is unchanged from a previous projection of an
earnings-per-share increase to a range of $3.40 to $3.60 for the
fiscal year ending June 30, the company expects that significant
special charges associated with the spinoff will reduce profit below
that range.
   Since the operating results of Morton International and Thiokol
will be reported separately for the quarter and fiscal year ending
June 30, no revised projection is being made for Morton Thiokol.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Shoe Corp. is taking off its shoes, the
company said Monday in announcing a deal to sell its footwear
division, name and Cincinnati headquarters to a management-led group
for $422.5 million in cash.
   The purchase excludes U.S. Shoe's Cincinnati-based LensCrafters
division, which operates retail eyeglass stores, and the women's
apparel retail division, based in Enfield, Conn.
   Key executives of U.S. Shoe's footwear division, including Howard
Platt, a company executive vice president who is president of the
footwear division, are leaders in the purchasing group, U.S. Shoe
announced.
   The deal involves the footwear division, U.S. Shoe's Cincinnati
headquarters and its major footwear distribution center in
Cincinnati. U.S. Shoe said it will surrender its name to the new
company and choose another name more suited to its remaining
businesses.
   The transaction is to be concluded within 90 days. U.S. Shoe's
board of directors said it plans to use some of the proceeds of the
sale to raise the dividend on the stock to $1 this year from 46
cents.
   U.S. Shoe shares fell $5.62{ to close at $20.12{ in heavy
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading Monday. The company's
announcement failed to live up to expectations by some analysts that
the entire company would be sold.
   The footwear division makes, imports and sells footwear, and
operates about 500 retail stores and leased departments. The
division sells boots through its Texas Boot and Wrangler Boot
divisions, and markets women's footwear lines Amalfi, Bandolino,
Calvin Klein, Capezio, Cobbie, David Evins, Easy Spirit, Evan
Picone, Garolini, Innovations, Joyce, Liz Claiborne, Pappagallo, Red
Cross Shoes and Selby.
   The company said it expects the net proceeds will total $390
million, after taxes and expenses, and is subject to possible
adjustments of the purchase price before the transaction is closed.
   Up to $50 million of the proceeds will be used to pay off
long-term debts, U.S. Shoe officials said.
   Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc., an affiliate of Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets, is leading the investment group and has
provided commitments for $160 million of equity and subordinated
debt financing for the transaction, U.S. Shoe said.
   Philip G. Barach, chairman and chief executive officer of U.S.
Shoe, said the sale results from an overall review the company
announced last August to explore ways it could increase corporate
value to the shareholders.
   ``As part of this process, approximately 80 parties worldwide
were contacted in an effort to solicit offers for all of U.S. Shoe
or for any of its businesses,'' he said.
   Barach said no prospective buyer wanted to acquire all of U.S.
Shoe or made an acceptable offer for the women's apparel division.
Several bidders made offers for the LensCrafters division, but it
was retained in part because of its strong potential for growth, he
said.
   U.S. Shoe's board has approved an accelerated expansion of the
LensCrafters division in fiscal 1989 to 75 stores, rather than the
30 earlier planned, Barach said.
   U.S. Shoe plans to lease its headquarters offices from the
purchasing company. Both companies will share certain services and
will remain in Cincinnati, officials said.

<HEAD>Intel Introduces `Supercomputer On A Chip'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``supercomputer on a chip'' hailed
by engineers as a technological marvel because it can be used as the
basis for a new generation of high-speed computers was formally
unveiled Monday by Intel Corp.
   The i860 chip was touted at the company's headquarters as the
first 64-bit microprocessor capable of performing operations
typically associated only with supercomputing systems and
three-dimensional graphics workstations.
   The chip is crammed with more than a million transistors, nearly
four times the number found on current microprocessors.
   ``The level of integration and performance (the i860) provides
puts supercomputing power in the hands of virtually anyone who can
afford a desktop computer,'' said David L. House, Intel senior vice
president and general manager of its microcomputer components group.
   International Business Machines Corp. and Ing. Olivetti are among
50 companies that have made commitments to use the i860, said Claude
Leglise, marketing manager for Intel's microprocessor division.
   The chip performs up to 80 million calculations per second and is
priced at $750. It operates on instructions that are as long as
those used in mainframe and supercomputers.
   Intel last month said it would make the i860, which it initially
called the N-10, available as a helper chip as well as making it
available to other companies as a central processor for engineering
and graphics workstations and multi-user computers.
   As a helper chip, the i860 could handle the ``grunt work'' of
high-speed, repetitive calculations while a computer's main
processor handles more complex tasks.
   That's a bold decision because it pits the chip against
established chips made by competititors such as Sun Microsystems
Inc., Mips Computers Systems Inc. and Motorola Inc.
   Intel said the chip will be available by the third quarter of
1989.
   The i860 is built with so-called RISC technology, for reduced
instruction set computing. That means it cannot be used as a plug-in
replacement for the microprocessors used in industry-standard
personal computers.
   ``Getting IBM as a user is an important feather in their cap,''
said Daniel Klesken, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco. ``The RISC battle is heating up.''
   RISC is important because it represents leading-edge
semiconductor technology, which is used in computer workstations,
the fastest growing segment of the computer business. Workstations
are free-standing computers.
   IBM will use the i860 in an add-on board for its latest personal
computer line, called Micro Channel, while Olivetti plans to make
the chip the centerpiece of a new line of minicomputers.
   Motorola on Tuesday plans to unveil its first computer systems
using its own RISC chips. The systems, the Delta Series 8000, are
based on Motorola's 88000 RISC processor and offer performance that
ranges from 17 million to 60 million instructions per second.
   Intel said the i860 is ideal for computation-intensive
applications and those requiring the interactive display of
three-dimensional images, such as fluid dynamics, molecular
modeling, structural analysis and econometric modeling. The company
said general business applications also will benefit because of the
incomparable performance.
   ``Until today, users basically had three choices if they wanted
to perform these applications efficiently: They could share time on
a multimillion-dollar supercomputer, if they could gain access to
one; they could share time on a $500,000 minisupercomputer; or they
could use a less powerful, but more interactive $100,000 graphics
supercomputer,'' House said in a statement.
   The United States continues to dominate in processor chips _ the
brains of computers _ even though Japan has taken over most of the
work market for memory chips.
   On Feb. 14, NEC Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. both announced high-speed
microprocessors that they said were the fastest of their kind.
   Hitachi's runs at up to 70 million instructions per second. The
company did not describe at the time what the chip could be used for.
   NEC's V-70 runs at 10 million to 20 million instructions per
second and its V-80 runs at 15 million to 22 million instructions
per second. Those chips are mainly for telecommunications.

   A federal judge has overturned a Scripps
Clinic patent on an anti-bleeding substance for hemophiliacs,
allowing rival firms to continue work on their own versions of the
potentially lucrative product.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge William Schwarzer, made public
Monday, was a victory for the biotechnology company Genentech Inc.
and the license-holder of its patent, Miles Laboratories Inc., which
otherwise could have been forbidden from further work and possibly
required to pay damages.
   ``This does a great deal to lift the clouds of uncertainty in an
area that's previously been uncertain,'' said Bud Modersbach, a
lawyer for Cutter Biological, a division of Miles. Cutter has begun
human clinical trials of a version of the substance produced through
gene-splicing but has not obtained federal approval to market it.
   Eugene Moroz, a lawyer for Scripps Clinic and Research
Foundation, said the company disagreed with the ruling and was
hopeful of a reversal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit.
   The ruling does not prevent the Rorer Group Inc., which is
licensed to use the Scripps patent, from continuing to sell a
blood-clotting product called Monoclate. But if the decision is
upheld, it will prevent Rorer from dominating ``a very large
market,'' said Stephen Raines, Genentech's vice president for
patents.
   The substance is an artificial form of a clotting protein called
Human Factor VIII, found in healthy people but missing in
hemophiliacs.
   Scripps' version of the purified protein, made from human and pig
blood plasma, received a patent in 1982 and an updated patent in
1984. Genentech, using different technology, produced a similar
protein in 1984.
   Schwarzer ruled in 1987 that Genentech had violated Scripps'
patent, but he refused to halt work by Genentech. The judge said
hemophiliacs could suffer if development of the product was
hampered, and also noted Genentech's challenge to the validity of
Scripps' patent.
   In his latest ruling, Schwarzer found:
   _Scripps' patent did not describe, or adequately identify, the
particular substance or antibody that would make the substance work.
   _The updating of the patent by the U.S. Patent Office in 1985 was
based on Scripps' claim that its 1982 patent application contained
inadvertent errors. Schwarzer said the claim of error, which is
required for expansion of a patent, were ``incredible'' coming from
experienced patent lawyers.
   _Scripps was guilty of ``inequitable conduct'' for submitting
patent claims based on a purified product when one of its samples
contained 50 percent contamination.
   _A 1979 doctoral thesis by a student researcher had publicly
revealed the process of producing a clotting product with the same
potency as the Scripps patent. That finding would invalidate several
aspects of the patent.
