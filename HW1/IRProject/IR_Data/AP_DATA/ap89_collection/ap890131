   Officials of the World Alpine Ski
Championships maintained Tuesday that no safety violations
contributed to the death of a cousin of Spain's king, but a champion
skiier suggested the victim was on a closed course.
   The Duke of Cadiz, a 52-year-old first cousin of King Juan Carlos
and member of the international governing body of ski racing, was
killed Monday at the Beaver Creek ski resort when he ran into a
cable being raised to hold a finish-line banner for the men's
downhill course.
   Alfonso de Borbon y de Dampierre suffered neck lacerations and
apparently died instantly, Eagle County Coroner Donna Meineke said.
An official cause of death had not been released by Tuesday
afternoon.
   De Borbon was at one-time married to the granddaughter of Spanish
dictator Francisco Franco. Although he was not in the line of
succession to the Spanish throne, he was a descendant of Louis XIV,
the French Sun King, and was the Bourbon or ``legitimist'' candidate
for king had the monarchy ever been restored in France.
   King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia in Spain expressed their sorrow
over his death.
   ``There is no reason to believe that any safety violations
occurred,'' Bob Knous, president of the championships' organizing
committee, told a news conference Tuesday.
   ``It truly appears that this was an accident, a very, very
unfortunate and tragic incident,'' Knous said.
   Sheriff A.J. Johnson would not say Tuesday night whether Eagle
County officials agree with Knous.
   ``We will make no conclusions about safety violations, not until
the investigation is done,'' Johnson said. ``I will discuss the
investigation with the district attorney. Until then, we are looking
at all possibilities.''
   But defending world downhill champion Peter Mueller of
Switzerland said the victim and other ski officials ignored normal
procedures when they skied down a closed course.
   Johnson, who said his investigation would take a month, confirmed
that the course was closed, but said, ``We believe he (de Borbon)
had the authority to be on there.''
   De Borbon was skiing Monday with companions when he hit the cable
as course workers were moving the finish line and banners uphill
from the end of the slalom course to the end of the downhill.
   Witnesses said one of the companions, former Austrian Olympic
champion Toni Sailer, saw the cable and warned de Borbon, who
acknowledged the warning but still slammed into it at neck level,
according to Johnson.
   Knous said there were no safety violations despite the fact that
the course was closed following an inspection by the International
Ski Federation, known by its French initials as FIS. Also there were
no banners or identifying material on the cable that the duke hit.
   He said he couldn't comment on whether the duke and his skiing
companions should have been on the course at the time.
   Mueller, 31, one of the favorites in Saturday's race, said:
``Normally, when we prepare for a competition, the course is closed.
But here, the FIS is skiing down for pleasure. I think that's a big
mistake. If the downhill course is closed, it should be closed for
all people.''
   Downhill training went on as scheduled Tuesday although social
events were canceled or postponed. Officials of the championships
wore black armbands, and flags throughout the ski resort flew at
half-staff.
   The Spanish ski team, which had been training at another Colorado
ski resort, still planned to come to Vail and compete, Knous said.
The championship meet continues through this weekend.
   De Borbon served as Spain's ambassador to Sweden from 1969 to
1973, was president of the Spanish Skiing Federation from 1977 to
1984 and an eight-time Spanish skiing champion.
   De Borbon's father was the elder brother of King Juan Carlos'
father. Both men's fathers were the sons of King Alfonso XIII, who
abdicated the Spanish throne in 1931.
   The duke married Carmen Franco in 1972 and they divorced in 1982.
   In February 1984, the older of his two sons was killed in an auto
accident in which de Borbon was driving. A judge ruled that de
Borbon had been negligent and stripped him of the custody of his
other son.
   Francisco Fernandez-Ochoa, the slalom gold medalist at the 1972
Olympics and a close friend of the duke, said de Borbon liked to
``ski fast and drive fast.''
   Referring to the duke's divorce, the fatal auto accident and the
skiing tragedy, Fernandez-Ochoa described the victim as ``an unlucky
person. Bad things happened to him.''

   After years of cold-shouldering the United
Nations, the United States now sings its praises and increasingly
suggests things for it to do. But U.S. dollars to match the tasks
are not forthcoming and the United States remains the biggest U.N.
debtor.
   The United States is urging the world body to take on more
responsibilities _ from monitoring the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan and Cuban withdrawal from Angola to fighting terrorism
and drug trafficking and investigating human rights abuses and
chemical warfare.
   It also is expected to monitor the eventual Vietnamese withdrawal
from Cambodia and to play a role in a Middle East settlement.
   But little money is forthcoming from the U.S. Congress to fund
the burgeoning U.S. agenda for the 159-nation organization. The
United States is the largest U.N. contributor, assessed one-quarter
of the annual budget of $800 million.
   While the United Nations has registered a series of formidable
peacemaking and peacekeeping successes that advance U.S. interests,
Congress has been withholding U.S. dues.
   The United States ended 1988 about $402 million in arrears in
budget and peacekeeping dues _ 53.5 percent of the total U.N.
arrears of more than $750 million.
   Largely because of U.S. nonpayment, the United Nations
periodically faces financial crises and is having trouble paying for
new peackeeping operations.
   President Bush, a former U.S. ambassador here, praised the United
Nations during his election campaign and called for the payment of
U.S. dues.
   Congress has been withholding a large part of the dues because of
budget constraints and disaffection with the world body. The
organization was seen as biased against the United States,
bureaucratically bloated and wasteful.
   Some money was withheld in an effort to force the United Nations
to reform itself, despite administration and State Department calls
for full-funding.
   George P. Shultz said before leaving office as secretary of state
said it is important for U.S. foreign policy ``to fully fund our
contributions to U.N. agencies ... and to initiate a plan to pay
arrearages ... over a five-year period.''
   He said the request for nearly full payment of dues ``is critical
to our objectives of resolving regional conflicts. The U.N. can play
an important role in this regard.''
   U.S. Undersecretary of State Richard S. Williamson, in charge of
international organizations, said, ``Up through last year, the
Executive, State Department and White House sought full funding.
Congress failed to appropriate the full amount.''
   In a telephone interview, Williamson said some people ``hold the
United Nations in disrepute when it does disreputable things.'' It
rightfully is criticized, he said, for overspending and for
political moves like a General Assembly resolution equating Zionism
with racism.
   But he said the United Nations has improved because the United
States took a firm stand.
   Last year, the United Nations scored spectacular achievements and
its peacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace Prize.
   In Afghanistan, U.N. observers are monitoring Soviet withdrawal
under a U.N.-mediated agreement. For years, ending Soviet
involvement in Afghanistan was a prime U.S. foreign policy goal.
   In the Persian Gulf, U.N. peacekeepers are monitoring a
cease-fire while Iran and Iraq are talking under U.N. auspices. The
cease-fire enabled the United States to scale back its costly naval
presence there.
   In southern Africa, the United Nations is helping to fulfill
another U.S. goal: getting Soviet-backed Cuban troops out of Angola.
U.N. observers will monitor the Cuban pullout and peacekeepers will
oversee Namibia's transition to independence from South Africa under
a U.N. plan.
   In the Western Sahara conflict, a U.N. peace plan has been
accepted by Morocco, anti-Moroccan guerrillas and Algeria and the
world body will supervise free elections there. In Cyprus, U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has sponsored talks
between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities to discuss
reunification of the Mediterranean island.
   In his final budget, President Ronald Reagan requested nearly
full U.N. funding in the 1990 fiscal year _ $205.5 million for the
regular budget _ plus an additional $46 million to begin paying off
U.S. arrears. The arrears of $403 million include $307.7 million for
the budget and $94.1 million for peacekeeping.
   The Soviet Union has been paying its arrears and now owes $9
million to the regular budget and $172 million to peacekeeping.
   For almost eight years the Reagan administration and the world
body were estranged. The United States charged it was ineffectual,
pro-Soviet, anti-American and wasteful. But in his farewell address
to the General Assembly in September, Reagan praised the world body
for helping to end regional conflicts.

<TEXT>
   The giant panda Ying-Ying, the female of the
pair that made Mexico's panda breeding program the most successful
outside China, has died of unknown causes _ possibly a broken heart
_ at age 14.
   Ying-Ying, who died late Sunday, had been depressed since
October, about three months after Pe-Pe, her mate, died of cancer,
said Maria Elena Hoyo, director of the Chapultepec Zoo.
   She said Ying-Ying had been ill for several days.
   ``We don't what she died of,'' Ms. Hoyo said. ``The autopsy
didn't determine the cause'' but zoo officials hope laboratory tests
will determine the cause.
   She said Ying-Ying had until Pe-Pe's death spent every day with
the panda China sent as a gift in 1975, when Ying-Ying was 11 months
old.
   ``She didn't want to live without Pe-Pe,'' Ms. Hoyo said. ``She
was very much in love with Pe-Pe. She didn't want to go out into the
garden. She ate but not as well as she used to.
   ``She wasn't as aggressive, as sure of herself. Before she
wouldn't let you touch her and recently it didn't matter to her.''
   Giant pandas are an endangered species and only about 18 are in
captivity outside China. The animals generally have a life
expectancy of about 20 years.
   Ying-Ying, who was nearly 15, gave birth to seven offspring after
natural mating with Pe-Pe. Four survived. Ying-Ying accidentally
rolled onto the first cub eight days after its birth in 1980,
crushing it, and one each of two sets of twins died.
   Tohui, the oldest of the four surviving offspring, set off panda
mania when she was born July 21, 1981, and is the zoo's hope for
continuing to produce more pandas. In December, the London Zoo sent
its 16-year-old male panda to Mexico in hopes the two would mate.
   Ms. Hoyo said Ying-Ying's body, like Pe-Pe's, will be stuffed and
put on display.

   President Bush has called free choice
``the single most promising idea'' in education. But he'd get an
argument from Bob Duncan and others involved in the nation's most
comprehensive application of the concept.
   ``I don't know if anyone can say it is off to a good start,''
said Duncan, superintendent of a school district on northern
Minnesota's Iron Range. ``We're very close to being out of
business.''
   The problem is that nearly a third of the district's 1,000
students have applied to attend school in neighboring Virginia,
Minn., next year. The exodus is possible because of a statewide open
enrollment program that will give all public school students freedom
to choose where they attend school.
   Duncan's district stands in contrast to the affluent public
schools in Edina, a predominantly white district in suburban
Minneapolis. Two districts do not take outsiders: Sartell, because
it is crowded; and Edina, because it voted not to take part in the
open enrollment program.
   Critics say the open enrollment program won't reach the poor,
penalizes small towns, invites inter-school athletic recruiting,
leaves some districts with inappropriate staffing levels, and
provides dissident parents an extortion tool to use on school boards.
   Others hail the program for promoting excellence.
   At a White House Workshop on Choice in Education on Jan. 10,
former President Reagan referred to open enrollment as ``that
marvelous program in Minnesota that is fostering unprecedented
competition among public schools to make them more attractive to
parents and students.''
   Reagan and Bush are not the only admirers of the plan, which
encourages free market-type competition among public schools.
   Peggy Hunter, enrollment options specialist with the state
Education Department, said the program will probably ``weed out''
lackluster schools.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich said the program makes the state ``a national
leader in empowering families to make choices about their children's
education.''
   But not all state officials are convinced.
   ``Based on the limited experience we've had in this state, it's
ridiculous,'' said state Rep. Bob McEachern, chairman of the state
House Education Committee.
   Only 435 of Minnesota's 740,000 grade school and high school
students applied for the program this year and applications for next
year have reached 1,300. The program applies to school districts of
more than 1,000 students, and will be extended to all school
districts by the 1990-91 school year. Districts now have the option
of voting not to participate.
   ``It's a choice for the rich,'' McEachern insisted. ``That's
all.''
   In Mountain Iron and Buhl, communities still recovering from the
collapse of the taconite industry a decade ago, parents have been
divided over which school buildings to close in the aftermath of a
merger. Open enrollment has been an escape route from conflict,
Duncan said.
   The lower enrollment won't cut operating expenses, but it will
reduce state aid by $1.2 million, a third of the district's budget,
he said.
   ``If chaos continues, more students will leave and it will be
lights out,'' Duncan said.
   Duncan also said some poor families won't have access to open
enrollment because of transportation costs.
   In Edina, where the 6,000-pupil district is 96 percent white and
the average price of a home in 1985 was $141,000, the school board
voted to opt out of the program.
   ``We kind of anticipated that this would be viewed as a racially
motivated decision,'' said Edina School Superintendent Raymond
Smyth, who denied ``elitism'' played a role in the decision.
   He said open enrollment allows students to transfer schools for
athletic purposes and other reasons he considers ``trivial.''
Another drawback is the inevitable erosion of education quality for
students who remain in schools of declining enrollment, he said.
   But Hunter said Edina wants to ``pick and choose'' its students.
   ``The law says you can't deny a student because of their race or
their academic ability or whether they're a problem student. You
can't select and choose which kids are educated and Edina says `We
want to pick and choose,''' she said.
   The Minnesota Parent Teacher Association has warmly endorsed open
enrollment partly because ``parent and student satisfaction with
their school is absolutely vital to their success,'' said Barbara
Zohn, president.
   But Zohn noted that the PTA unsuccessfully lobbied for a
declining enrollment fund that would have sent state money for one
or two years to schools losing students to give them a chance to
improve.
   Duncan joked that the success of schools under open enrollment
may someday be linked to their marketing ability.
   ``How about, `Come here. We'll give all A's,' or `Finish four
years in three.'''

<HEAD>Mississippi Governor Wages Emotional Fight To Close Charity Hospitals</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Ray Mabus has gotten himself into an
emotional battle by proposing to close the three charity hospitals
that the nation's poorest state operates for its poorest people.
   Mabus says the poor would be better served if the money that
funds the hospitals went instead into Medicaid and attracted federal
funds, but opponents claim to have more than 100,000 petition
signatures to keep the hospitals open.
   Mabus, who took office a year ago after a reform-based campaign,
says the hospitals are underfunded and represent the lower tier of a
double standard of health care in Mississippi.
   ``We have to work toward the day when where you live and how much
you make are not the deciding factors in the standard of care you
get,'' the 40-year-old Democrat said recently.
   But he has been unable to convince some people that the health
care needs of the poor could be better served by closing Matty
Hersee Hospital in Meridian, South Mississippi State Hospital in
Laurel and Kuhn Memorial State Hospital in Vicksburg.
   The hospitals, set up in 1916, collectively maintain only 199 of
the state's more than 15,800 hospital beds on a budget of $6.8
million. They served 77,508 patients in the 1988 fiscal year, out of
a population of about 2.5 million. That includes 8,278 who required
hospitalization and 69,230 outpatients.
   ``The buildings are older buildings, but they are well kept and
they're very clean,'' said Peggy Sprayberry of the state
Eleemosynary Board, which oversees charity hospitals.
   The governor's plan sparked a recent rally at the state Capitol.
   ``I don't have no insurance, no Medicaid and you can't get no
doctor to wait on you if you don't have no money,'' said Georgia Mae
Jones, one of about 300 people who traveled the 90 miles from Laurel
for the rally.
   ``When you go to the state hospital they take good care of you.
They don't ask you if you got money. They just wait on you,'' Jones
said. ``If you go to these other hospitals, they're going to turn
you out. They're going to say you got to get some money and that's
something these people ain't got.''
   Mabus hastily called a news conference to counter the public
attention drawn to the rally.
   ``I think that the people marching today and I have the same aims
and that's quality health care for Mississippians,'' Mabus said. ``I
think as governor I've got to make the decision of how we can get
the most health care for the most people.''
   Mabus has said that putting into Medicaid the money that now goes
for the charity hospitals would attract to the state an additional
$28 million in federal matching dollars. He also has proposed other
Medicaid expansions.
   Mississippi spent $440,258,967 on Medicaid in the 1988 fiscal
year, which ended June 30, 1988. Of that, $346,324,369 was in
federal matching funds and $93,934,598 in state funds.
   Mabus said his plan would provide medical assistance to far more
people than are served by the charity hospitals.
   ``By shifting these funds to Medicaid, we can cover literally
tens of thousands more Mississipians statewide. We can do it in a
more equitable manner,'' he said.
   But opponents say they have more than 100,000 signatures on
petitions and most legislators from the areas where the hospitals
are located have worked against the governor's plan.
   ``My question is, if you close the charity hospitals, how many
working poor people are going to fall through the cracks?'' asked
state Sen. Alan Heflin, whose district includes Matty Hersee.
   But lawmakers who back the goveror's proposal agree with him that
the issue is one of quality health care for the poor.
   ``I think the people of Mississippi can be served by the charity
hospitals it they're properly funded, but they're not properly
funded and the Legislature has refused to properly fund them for the
last 10 years,'' said Rep. Ed Buelow.

<HEAD>Twenty Major Arms Companies To Display Wares In Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 20 major arms companies from
Western Europe, China and the Soviet bloc will show some of their
wares at the Baghdad defense equipment exhibition in April, a
newspaper reported.
   The companies include France's Thompson-CSF, Matra, Aerospaciale
and Dassault groups and Italy's Fiat, the al-Itihad business weekly,
mouthpiece of the Iraqi General Federation of Chambers of Commerce,
said Monday.
   France was Iraq's second biggest arms supplier after the Soviet
Union during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which a U.N.-sponsored
cease-fire halted on Aug. 20.
   The weekly quoted Industry Minister Hussein Kamel as saying the
five-day exhibition that begins April 28 will ``provide the
opportunity for all concerned to become acquainted with technical
developments in this field.''
   Iraq has claimed to build its own long-range missiles, which were
used against Iranian cities during the war, and is seeking to
develop its own arms industry. It is believed to be cooperating with
Argentina to develop a new missile.

   Hedda Nussbaum has become a powerful symbol of
family violence and could become a powerful advocate for other
battered women, says the psychiatrist who is nurturing her recovery.
   Tragedy put Ms. Nussbaum into her role, portrayed by prosecutors
as a brainwashed victim of brutality and by Joel Steinberg's defense
as a fraud who killed the little girl they illegally adopted and
raised until her death at age 6.
   The once-pretty woman bared her scarred face and psyche to
television viewers during testimony that unraveled an all-too-common
story of domestic violence. A state jury Monday convicted Steinberg
of manslaughter.
   When Ms. Nussbaum, a 46-year-old former children's book editor
for Random House, was arrested with Steinberg after little Lisa
Steinberg's death, she had a black eye, broken nose, nine fractured
ribs, split lip, cauliflower ear, and a leg so severely ulcerated
that doctors called the injury life-threatening.
   Charges against her were dropped when prosecutors determined she
was too physically and mentally incapacitated to be responsible for
the girl's death. Ms. Nussbaum agreed to become the key prosecution
witness.
   Steinberg, 47, was charged with beating Lisa on the night of Nov.
1, 1987. The death, three days later, of a child from an affluent,
well-educated household, shocked many and became a nationwide symbol
of family violence as a problem that cuts across social strata.
   Ms. Nussbaum's testimony described a 12-year relationship in
which she was beaten, brainwashed and subjected to other bizarre
punishments for transgressions imagined by Steinberg.
   Slowly, deliberately, Ms. Nussbaum told how she came to see
Steinberg as a ``godlike figure'' _ asking his permission to eat,
obeying his orders to sleep on the floor or sit in a tub of cold
water.
   Jurors saw handwritten pages in which Ms. Nussbaum vowed to care
about Steinberg's hair, clothes, work, problems, diet, future, teeth
and other concerns. In another paper, she wrote 10 times that
``anger is destructive'' and that ``self-defense is regressive.''
   Her psychiatrist, Samuel Klagsbrun, has said Ms. Nussbaum won't
be ready to leave the Four Winds hospital in Katonah, north of New
York, for at least two months. But while she hasn't made definite
plans, Klagsbrun said he wouldn't be surprised to see Ms. Nussbaum
become an advocate for other battered women.
   ``She feels an obligation at this point to be helpful to others _
in helping people stand up and fight for themselves and regain a
level of self-respect,'' said Klagsbrun. ``She's very conscious of
the responsibility she now has to take a horrible part of her life
and make it useful for other women as well as for herself, her own
healing.''
   ``She's articulate and intelligent. She has the capacity to
relate and be available to other people'' _ and already has helped
other patients during her hospitalization, said Klagsbrun.
   ``Her impact on other people who have experienced battering has
been enormous,'' he said. ``She has allowed some people to reveal
more than they were prepared to do ... to feel they can assert
themselves in society and stand up to evil. People have said things
along those lines to her.''
   During seven days of testimony in December, Ms. Nussbaum said
that Steinberg told her in bed, after they had free-based cocaine
and while Lisa lay comatose on their bathroom floor, that he had
``knocked Lisa down and she didn't want to get up.''
   The defense charged that Ms. Nussbaum was jealous of Steinberg's
attention toward Lisa and inflicted the fatal injuries.
   Prosecutors said Ms. Nussbaum, who lost her job when she
frequently missed work because of injuries, suffered from the
battered spouse syndrome and was herself too much a victim herself
to have hurt, or helped, the child.

   Richard Ramirez is charged with 13 ``Night
Stalker'' slayings, along with 30 other felonies, including
attempted murder, rape and assault. Here is a list of the murder
victims referred to Monday in prosecutors' opening arguments:
   _June 1984: Jennie Vincow, 79, of Eagle Rock, killed during an
apparent burglary at her home, found with her throat slashed.
   _March 17, 1985: Dale Okazaki, 34, of Rosemead, found shot to
death in her condominium. A roommate, Marie Hernandez, was wounded
but survived.

   The waistcoat reputedly worn by King Charles I at
his beheading in 1649 is being taken back to the Museum of London
today, after a police crime lab failed to determine if its
mysterious stains are royal blood.
   ``We have examined it but we cannot tell if the stains are
blood,'' said Graham Divall, a biochemist at the Metropolitan Police
Forensic Science Laboratory.
   ``If we had a piece of the silk we could look for some form of
hemoglobin by using intensive X-rays to show the protein structure,
but naturally, the museum won't let us cut it up,'' said Divall.
   To discover whether the stains could have been the king's blood,
the museum sent the waistcoat to the lab, where it underwent the
routine tests that would be conducted in a modern-day crime, Divall
said.
   ``I am convinced we have the king's waistcoat,'' Kay Staniland,
the museum's keeper of costume and textiles, said on Monday, the
340th anniversary of the execution.
   ``The workmanship of the knitting is right for the time and when
it was bought for us from a collector in 1925, it had a note
attached saying it had belonged to Dr. Hobbs, the physician who
attended the king on the scaffold. It then passed to his daughter,
Susannah, and remained with their descendants until it was auctioned
in 1898,'' Miss Staniland said.
   The faded blue silk waistcoat is believed to have been worn by
the king next to his skin when his head was chopped off on Jan. 30,
1649, after he lost his long struggle against the Puritan leader,
Oliver Cromwell. The monarch stepped out on the scaffold in
Whitehall, central London, from a window of the Banqueting House,
which still stands.
   The long-sleeved garment with buttoned neck opening and small
upstanding collar has armpit stains, probably from sweat, but no
collar stains. Two large stains, on the upper chest and abdomen,
have survived an attempt to clean them off.
   ``We took ultraviolet light photographs and did a very sensitive
chemical test for blood which we are doing every day on clothing,
weapons and at the scene of a crime. We were not surprised at the
negative results because blood would have degraded in 300 years,''
he said.
   The king was a small man, and the waistcoat's chest measures only
28 inches. It is long enough to reach his thighs.
   ``We wanted to see if the legend about the stains being blood
could be true. But the only way we could prove that without
destroying anything was if we had some proved bloodstains of the
same period and we haven't,'' said Suzanne Keene, the museum's head
of conservation.
   ``An eyewitness of the execution said the king was wearing a sky
blue garment, and the waistcoat is a faded sky blue,'' Ms. Keene
added.
   Miss Staniland said: ``Authentication is a difficult business and
it would help if we had other garments of the king.''
   Knitted 17th century silk garments are believed to have been made
in Italy or Spain.
   The waistcoat is displayed beside a sample of modern knitting in
the same pattern as the waistcoat. Below it is a German engraving of
the execution, supposedly drawn by a witness and showing the king
kneeling.
   ``But the execution block was only 10 inches high so he must have
been lying prone,'' Miss Staniland said.

<TEXT>
   A jury Monday convicted Joel Steinberg of
manslaughter in the beating death of his illegally adopted
6-year-old daughter, Lisa, a death that refocused national attention
on domestic violence.
   Steinberg showed no emotion as each of the 12 jurors was polled
on the verdict, which came at 6:38 p.m, on the eighth day of
deliberations in the three-month-old trial. He was acquitted on the
more serious charge of second-degree murder.
   The verdict culminated a case that touched the nation's
conscience, with witnesses providing wrenching detail of the
physical and emotional havoc wrought by spousal and child abuse _
and the failure of others to intercede.
   Lisa's biological mother, Michele Launders, 27, said before the
jury returned that ``the only verdict that would be justice for Lisa
is murder.'' After the verdict, she left the courtroom in tears and
would not speak to reporters.
   She was sitting next to Graceann Smigiel, the grandmother of a
young boy who was found in Steinberg's apartment when police and
Emergency Medical Service paramedics removed Lisa's comatose body
the morning of Nov. 2, 1987.
   The boy, who also was illegally adopted by Steinberg, has since
been returned to his biological mother.
   The conviction on the charge of first-degree manslaughter carries
a maximum sentence of 8 1-3 to 25 years. It was a charge that
prosecutors at one time had considered dropping from the case.
Sentencing was set for March 8.
   In acquitting Steinberg of murder, the jury apparently concluded
that Steinberg meant to hurt Lisa but not to kill her; a
second-degree manslaughter conviction would have meant he did not
mean to hurt her but showed reckless disregard for her life.
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who promised to ask for the
maximum punishment, said the trial ``highlighted the dreadful
problems that beset our city _ child abuse, drug abuse and family
violence. All of us have a responsibility to work to ensure that
similar tragedies do not re-occur.''
   Ira London, Steinberg's lawyer, said: ``We do not consider this
(verdict) a win for Joel or a triumph for Joel.''
   One of the jurors, Helena Barthell, 36, she argued in favor of
convicting Steinberg of murder, said the jury had ``virtually
ignored'' the testimony of Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's battered
live-in companion of 12 years.
   Ms. Nussbaum's lawyer, Barry Scheck, said she is ``relieved it's
all over.'' He said she watched the verdict on television at the
psychiatric facility in Westchester County, where she has lived
since March 1988.
   ``The possibility of a hung jury was a very frightening prospect
for her. She would have to go through this all again,'' he said.
   Public attention was riveted on the trial during Ms. Nussbaum's
seven days of testimony last month. Her story of abuse and
psychological manipulation was broadcast live on New York's three
television network affiliates and in part nationally on the Cable
News Network.
   Ms. Nussbaum, testifying under immunity from prosecution, said
she was so dominated by Steinberg that she was unable to defend
herself from virtually systematic beatings, or to protect the child,
Lisa Steinberg.
   She also said she was unable to bring herself to summon medics
promptly on Nov. 1, 1987, after Steinberg told her Lisa was
unconscious on the bathroom floor. The girl lay there nearly 12
hours by the time Ms. Nussbaum called an ambulance; she died of
brain damage in a hospital three days later.
   Defense lawyers claimed it was Ms. Nussbaum, Steinberg's live-in
girlfriend, who fatally beat Lisa out of jealousy over the attention
Steinberg paid the child. Prosecutors _ pointing to Ms. Nussbaum's
own severe injuries and deteriorated mental state _ said she was
incapable of such an act.
   ``She was a 45-year-old woman who appeared much older than her
age,'' the emergency room doctor who examined Ms. Nussbaum after her
arrest testified at trial. ``She was chronically debilitated,
malnourished, wasted.''
   Nonetheless, state Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax
instructed the jury that it must consider Ms. Nussbaum an accomplice
in Lisa's death. As such, her testimony had to be supported by other
evidence.
   It was the layers of tragedy in the Steinberg case that commanded
public attention. One question was how Ms. Nussbaum, a former
children's book editor, could allow herself _ much less the child _
to sustain such damage.
   Another was how bruises on Lisa could have been noticed by a
student teacher at her elementary school and by neighbors, but
failed to come to the attention of child welfare officials. Yet
another issue was the ease with which Steinberg illegally gained
custody of Lisa and another child, 16-month old Mitchell, from their
unwed teen-age mothers.
   And at the center of the case were the unknown motivations of
Steinberg, a lawyer who was disbarred last fall for having falsely
claimed a military exemption from the bar exam. He did not testify
at the trial.
   Steinberg's lawyers denied that he ever beat Lisa. Prosecutors
and Ms. Nussbaum told another story.
   Ms. Nussbaum testified that on Nov. 1, 1987, he ordered her and
the girl to eat hot peppers, then drink large amounts of water _
typical of the irrational behavior common in the household.
   Ms. Nussbaum said that she was in the bathroom when Lisa went
into the bedroom to ask Steinberg if she could go out to dinner with
him. About 6 or 6:30 p.m., he walked into the bathroom, holding
Lisa's limp body.
   ``And I said, `What happened?''' Ms. Nussbaum testified. ``He
said, `What's the difference what happened? This is your child.
Hasn't this gone far enough?'''
   They put the unconscious child on the bathroom floor. Steinberg
then left for dinner, saying ``Don't worry, just let her sleep,''
she testified.
   When Steinberg returned from dinner about 10 p.m., she said they
smoked cocaine. It was then that he admitted hitting the girl, she
testified.
   About 6 a.m., Steinberg said Lisa had stopped breathing and tried
to revive her, she said. They finally called 911 at 6:30 a.m., she
said.
   Steinberg's lack of concern for the girl exhibited ``more than
depraved indifference to human life,'' Assistant District Attorney
Peter Casolaro said at the trial. ``It was monumental indifference
to human life.''
   Staffers from St. Vincent's Hospital, many of them clearly
hostile to Steinberg, testified that he appeared unconcerned about
Lisa's welfare and made distasteful comments when he was told she
had brain damage.
   ```What you're saying is she's not going to be an Olympic
swimmer,''' Dr. Patrick Kilhenny quoted Steinberg as replying.
   Casolaro also said Steinberg gave differing versions of details
of the events of the night of Nov. 1, including how Lisa was bruised.
   The defense said the prosecution's case, built largely on
circumstantial evidence, did not disprove every possibility except
Steinberg's guilt, as the law requires.
   Ira London and Adrian DiLuzio, Steinberg's lawyers, sought at
various times to explain Lisa's injuries by suggesting she had
choked on her dinner, had fallen, had been struck by a classmate,
had contracted Reye's syndrome and had been killed by doctors who
put a monitoring needle into her brain.

   Romanian police ``manhandled'' Britain's ambassador
to that country as they prevented him from visiting a government
critic who was under house arrest, the Foreign Office said.
   The Foreign Office on Monday summoned Romania's ambassador, Stan
Soare, to demand an apology for the incident in Cluj on Friday, when
Ambassador Hugh Arbuthnott tried to deliver a letter to historian
Doina Cornea.
   The ambassador, accompanied by his wife Vanessa, was physically
stopped by police at the garden gate of Mrs. Cornea's home and the
letter was snatched from his grasp, the Foreign Office said.
   ``The ambassador was prevented from meeting, and was manhandled
by the militiamen,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said. He spoke on
condition of not being identified.
   Mrs. Cornea has been under house arrest since last fall, when she
wrote a letter to the Western press protesting that Communist
Romania, under a policy of President Nicolae Ceausescu, was
deliberately destroying villages and farming communities.
   Later Friday, British diplomat Alan Clark was summoned to the
Foreign Ministry in Bucharest, which protested that Arbuthnott
``tried to go down a one-way street,'' and had ``mistreated and
insulted'' the police.
   Clark rejected the Romanian version and ``a somewhat heated
exchange ensued,'' the Foreign Office said.

<TEXT>
   Sir Georg Solti is passing the baton as Chicago
Symphony music director to Daniel Barenboim, who an orchestra member
characterized as a first-string quarterback who ``can lead us to the
Super Bowl.''
   The 46-year-old Argentine-born Israeli conductor and pianist was
named Monday to succeed Solti, who is retiring at the end of next
season after two decades as the orchestra's conductor.
   Barenboim, fired recently from the newly formed Opera-Bastille in
a power struggle, will continue as director of the Paris Orchestra,
a position he has held for 15 years, said Chicago Symphony
spokeswoman Susan Dewey.
   He and Solti will work together until Solti's retirement.
   ``Now we have two first-string quarterbacks, and either one can
lead us to the Super Bowl,'' said timpanist Donald Koss, chairman of
the Orchestra Members' Committee. ``We've played for maestro
Barenboim many times and know he is truly a world-class conductor,
absolutely first-rate.''
   ``In choosing Daniel Barenboim, I'm completely confident that we
have made the best possible choice for our orchestra,'' Orchestral
Association Chairman Richard L. Thomas said.
   ``With his infectious enthusiasm, his commitment to excellence
and his exceptional credentials, I have no doubt that he will build
on his previous accomplishments as well as those of the orchestra.''
   The 76-year-old Hungarian-born Solti, who has won a record-high
26 Grammys and has been Chicago music director since 1969, said he
had the ``health and energy'' to continue here, but felt it was
important to hand the baton over to someone younger.
   ``It is with the greatest pleasure that I welcome the appointment
of Daniel Barenboim as my successor,'' said Solti, who also was
Barenboim's predecessor at the Paris Orchestra. ``I have known him
and have been closely involved in his development as a conductor for
many years and he is my first choice.''
   Barenboim will be the ninth music director of the Chicago
Symphony, which was founded in 1891. He will begin his tenure Sept.
1, 1991.
   ``The past 20 years of music making with the orchestra as a guest
conductor have taught me to admire not only its unique qualities but
also its members' devotion to music,'' Barenboim said from Paris.
   Terms of the three-year contract call for Barenboim to conduct at
least 12 weeks of concerts in Chicago each season. He also will lead
all major tours for three to four weeks each year, Thomas said. The
salary was not announced.

<HEAD>Urban Bus Company Sends Drivers To Charm School</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ATHENS, Greece _ In a bid to control hot Mediterranean tempers
and teach them a smattering of English for the benefit of tourists,
Athens bus drivers are being sent to charm school.
   The $4.3 million program is aimed at improving the image of the
capital's public transportation system, which faces stiff
competition from taxis whose cost is among the cheapest in the world.
   Classes such as ``Driver and Communication with the Public'' and
``English for Drivers'' are part of the 15-day courses for the staff
of the semi-private Urban Transportation Company.
   ``The classes will help the driver control his Mediterranean
temperament ... but passengers must also understand that it's not
the driver's fault when the bus is late,'' said Andreas Kolas, a
spokesman for the Union of Bus Drivers.
   Quarrels often break out between bus drivers and passengers irked
by waiting for buses or when riders insist on getting off where
there is no bus stop.
   Because of the chaotic state of public transportation _ bus
routes and timetables are rarely available _ tourists often take
taxis, which cost about $2 for a three-mile ride. The bus fare is 20
cents.
   Kolas said drivers' manners aren't helped by the aggravation of
navigating the capital's notoriously congested streets.
   According to the transit company's chairman, Vassilis Xeomeritis,
about 3,500 of the 5,000 bus drivers are very experienced but
``older people with almost no education.
   ``Our drivers could use some retraining ... they must understand
that passengers are our customers and that it's the driver's duty to
serve the public,'' Xenomeritis said.
   The corporation's 1,200 buses cover the whole of Athens _ a
120-square-mile area. With only one subway line crossing the city,
more than 70 percent of Athenians commute by bus daily.
   A bus driver who wouldn't let his name be used said the public
should also ``learn how to behave'' and use the transportation
system properly.
   ``Passengers sometimes ask us unbelievable things,'' he said.
``We try to explain something to them and they are already so upset
that they turn around and swear at us.''
   About 1,500 drivers are scheduled for the course in 1989. The
rest will take it in the next couple of years, said Christos
Halazias, a transportation company spokesman.
   The corporation received almost half its financial backing for
the training program from the European Economic Community, he said.

   About 150 Haitian refugees crammed aboard a sailboat
were detained Monday after they were intercepted eight miles off the
entrance to the Port of Miami, the first such boatload this year,
authorities said.
   The group reportedly included two pregnant women and a child,
said U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Gary Starks.
   A tugboat spotted the wood-hulled vessel around 2:30 p.m. and the
Coast Guard immediately dispatched a patrol boat to the scene, just
east of Government Cut on the southern end of Miami Beach.
   The 40-foot sailboat apparently was not in jeopardy of capsizing,
the Coast Guard said, and two Haitian males suffering from severe
dehydration were airlifted late Monday to Jackson Memorial Hospital
for treatment.
   Late Monday, 149 Haitian refugees and one from the Dominican
Republic wer transferred to two Coast Guard cutters and were being
interviewed by immigration officials.
   The interviews to determine whether they would be brought ashore
or returned to their homeland would be made once all the interviews
were completed, the Coast Guard said.

   Morton Da Costa, 74, who directed some of
Broadway's biggest hits in the 1950s including ``The Music Man,''
``Auntie Mame,'' ``No Time for Sergeants'' and ``Plain and Fancy,''
died Sunday of a heart attack.
   Da Costa began his Broadway career as an actor. He had a small
role in the original 1942 production of Thornton Wilder's ``The Skin
of Our Teeth'' and understudied Montgomery Clift in the comedy. Da
Costa also played Osric in Maurice Evans' 1945 production of
``Hamlet.''
   He directed revivals of such plays as ``The Alchemist,'' ``She
Stoops to Conquer'' and ``Dream Girl.'' After directing the national
tour of the comedy hit ``Sabrina Fair'' in the early 1950s, Da Costa
had four big successes in a row on Broadway, starting with ``Plain
and Fancy.''
   In 1955, he directed ``No Time for Sergeants'' and ``Auntie
Mame'' in 1956.
   The following year, Da Costa had his biggest Broadway success
with ``The Music Man.'' It ran for more than four years and won a
Tony award as best musical.
   Among Da Costa's other musicals were ``Saratoga,'' ``Saratoga
Trunk,'' ``To Broadway With Love'' and ``Maggie Flynn.''

   Prince Alfonso de Bourbon of Spain, a
cousin of King Juan Carlos, was killed Monday in a ski accident on
the men's downhill course as it was being prepared for the World
Alpine Ski Championships. He was 52.
   Alfonso, Duke of Cadiz and Anjou, was not in the line of
succession to the Spanish throne. He served as his country as
ambassador to Sweden from 1970 to 1973 and as a lieutenant in the
Spanish air force.
   Alfonso was a member of the Council of the International Ski
Federation and former president of the Spanish Ski Federation.
   He formerly was married to Carmen Franco, granddaughter of the
late Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, but they were divorced

   Pegeen Fitzgerald, part of the first husband-wife
radio team whose broadcasts for half a century turned her life into
a public soap opera and entertained generations, died of cancer
Monday.
   Mrs. Fitzgerald's sister, Cristine Sharkey of Santa Barbara,
Calif., would not reveal her correct age.
   Mrs Fitzgerald career began in 1937 with a radio station owned by
a Portland, Ore., department store where she worked. Later that
year, a WOR-AM executive offered to put a microphone in her office
at the store and she soon was doing a half-hour show during her
lunch hour.
   When Mrs Fitzgerald caught pneumonia, management asked if she
could go on air from her hospital bed and later from her home while
she was convalescing.
   Because she did not want her announcer, Henry Morgan, to see her
in a bathrobe, she asked if her husband, Edward, could take his
place.
   The husband-wife combination became a radio first. Eleanor
Roosevelt once went to their apartment to watch the show.
   The couple argued on the air about such things as bills and
child-rearing, with Edward Fitzgerald becoming so angry during one
breakfast show that he went back to bed, leaving his wife to finish.
He died in 1982.

<HEAD>North's Images: Decorated Marine, Rogue Operator</HEAD>

   He is a man of conflicting images. A patriot,
seven rows of ribbons on his uniform, charged with crimes against
the United States.
   Barring new delay, Oliver Laurence North, 45, goes on trial
Tuesday, facing a dozen cover-up and tax counts stemming from his
role in the secret sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of some of
that money to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The jury will decide, in the end, whether this former lieutenant
colonel and junior staff member of the National Security Council was
true to his government and his mission, or whether his deceits,
principally to Congress, were the designs of a rogue operating
outside of law and White House order.
   Along the way, the nation may learn more about the worst foreign
policy debacle of Ronald Reagan's presidency. And about how North
came to run some of the administration's riskiest ventures from a
cluttered room, No. 392, in the Old Executive Office Building next
door to the White House.
   Congress tried for months to unravel those mysteries. But, like
the 1987 commission headed by incoming Defense Secretary John Tower,
congressional panels left many questions unanswered. Meanwhile, in
nationally televised hearings, a defiant Oliver North emerged from
his shadowy world, one of pseudonyms and codes and furtive border
crossings, to confront his legislative tormentors.
   ``Ollie stood up there, took the heat, and the American people in
every bar in Chicago and every bowling alley in Texas and every
little home said, `Hey, this guy believes in something, and I can
identify with it,''' said George Bush last December.
   North's bravura performance, and his subsequent whirlwind of
$25,000 speeches to cheering conservative groups around the country,
revealed just one of his many sides.
   He has always been ``Ollie'' to his White House co-workers and
the American right. But to his brothers and sisters, his high-school
chums back in his hometown of Philmont, N.Y., he remains Larry
North. To surviving members of his combat platoon in Vietnam, he is
``Blue,'' leader of ``Blue's Bastards.'' In other travels, he has
been ``Paul,'' or ``Mr. Goode,'' or ``Mr. Johns,'' or
``Steelhammer.''
   Another code name may be most telling: ``Blank Check.'' That was
the term assigned to the private, inter-office computer
communications network between North and his superior, former
National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter. The Tower commission
found that the creation of ``Blank Check'' coincided with the
initial shipment of anti-tank missiles to Iran, 14 months before the
scheme blew up in the administration's face in late 1986.
   According to Richard Allen, Reagan's first national security
adviser, North was brought to the NSC in 1981 ``to handle easels and
carry the charts.'' Yet he became, in a matter of months, the NSC's
chief troubleshooter, responsible for Central American and terrorism
issues, and played a vital role in some of the administration's most
daring foreign exploits.
   They included the invasion of Grenada in 1983; initial arms
shipments by the CIA to the Nicaraguan rebels, also in 1983; the
mining of three harbors in Nicaragua in early 1984; a crackdown on
the death squads in El Salvador and the organization of free
elections there; the interception of an Egyptian airliner carrying
the hijackers of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro, and the
bombing raid upon Libya in 1986.
   Part of North's ascendancy, no doubt, can be attributed to his
own drive and fervor. ``If there was a loose ball,'' said retired
Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, a key player in North's efforts to aid the
Contras, ``Oliver North would grab it and run with it.''
   As a youth, he was kept on a tight leash. His father, Oliver Clay
North, an Army colonel who won a Silver Star in World War II, worked
long hours at a family wool mill before it fell victim to polyester
and he switched to teaching history.
   His mother, Ann, would whistle for the kids to come in every
evening at 5 p.m. for dinner. Family ritual included a discussion of
world events before the table was cleared. In school, he ran track
and was in the chorus, chess, drama and science clubs as well as the
student council. The girls voted him best-looking.
   North intended to follow his father, who died three years ago,
into teaching, and enrolled at the state college at Brockport as an
English major _ not pre-med at Rochester as he later claimed _ and
joined the Marine Reserves as an officer trainee. After spending the
summer at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina he was a convert to the
Corps.
   His appointment to the Naval Academy came after his sophomore
year at Brockport, and North had to start over as a plebe. Then,
before he'd really settled in, he was in a car wreck, suffering
severe knee and back injuries.
   He boxed as a southpaw, and in the intramural ranks he made it
into the finals against a highly favored James Webb, later to become
a decorated combat veteran and a best-selling novelist. North won
again, on points.
   After his graduation, a review board threatened to dismiss him
because of his auto injuries. North made the board look at the film
of his fight against Webb. He got his commission.
   Soon after North and Betsy Stuart were married in a formal
military service, he was shipped out, in December 1968, to Vietnam.
   He was ``all guns, guts and glory,'' according to Randall Herrod,
a fellow ex-Marine officer whom North credits with saving his life
on the battlefield.
   Once, North was knocked off a tank rocked by enemy fire, and,
despite broken ribs and a punctured lung, rose up to kill the enemy
gunner with a grenade. That got him a Bronze Star. Other awards
followed.
   But North, in recounting his Vietnam experiences, has sometimes
seemed to exaggerate his record. He has testified that his
decorations included ``several'' purple hearts; military records
show two. He headed a platoon of 40 men, but said in court that he
was a company commander ``in the Special Operations Force.'' Again,
no record of it. He has said in court that he was in Vietnam from
1968 through early 1970 ``and then again in 1971,'' but the corps
says it has no record of an extended first tour or second tour.
   North did return to Vietnam, on his own time when word arrived
that Herrod had been charged with war crimes in the killing of women
and children. Herrod eventually was acquitted. While the case
dragged, North was going off voluntarily to fight in the bush.
   After tours at Quantico, Va., and on Okinawa, he wound up with a
desk at Marine Corps headquarters. He worked 18 hours a day.
Meanwhile, North and wife Betsy were going about the business of
raising their four children.
   Something finally snapped. North wound up in Bethesda Naval
Hospital for 22 days, diagnosed as suffering ``delayed battle
stress.'' Once again, he overcame his medical difficulties, and was
cleared for duty.

<HEAD>Commission Recommends Tax to Insure Those Without Coverage</HEAD>

   Employers and all but the poorest Americans
would be taxed to finance a national health care system extending
medical insurance to the estimated 37 million who lack coverage,
under a plan proposed by a commission including three former
presidents.
   The proposal encourages continued reliance on private health
insurance provided through the workplace, but calls for a new
program to provide universal access to basic medical services. Costs
would be spread among employers and all Americans above 150 percent
of poverty level.
   The plan offered Monday is designed to extend medical coverage to
all Americans, stem the growth of medical expenses which now stand
at $550 billion annually, and improve the quality of medical care
nationwide, said the National Leadership Commission on Health Care,
which worked 2{ years preparing its proposal.
   ``If we continue the present trend, the $550 billion will double
in six years and triple in 12 years,'' said Paul G. Rogers, a former
Democratic congressman from Florida who co-chaired the commission
with former Iowa Gov. Robert D. Ray, a Republican.
   The commission also is headed by three former presidents _
Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter _ who served as honorary
co-chairmen. The commission was financed by 38 corporations, unions
and foundations.
   The commission called its plan ``eminently fair,'' and estimated
it would add about $15 billion to the $550 billion already being
spent on health care annually.
   ``It is not something that will blow us over as a nation,'' said
Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton University professor of economics and
member of the commission.
   Members of the commission are to meet soon with Bush
administration officials and members of Congress to go over the
recommendations.
   Under the proposed system, all Americans would be covered by a
basic package of medical services, which would be the minimum
coverage for all private health insurance plans and for a publicly
funded benefits pool.
   Many workers would continue to get privately financed coverage as
an employment benefit, with the employer paying most or all of the
premium, and they could add to that coverage if they wanted. The
federal Medicare insurance program for older and disabled Americans
also would continue.
   Everyone else would be covered by the pool called the Universal
Access program. Recipients of Medicaid, the federal health insurance
program for the poor, would be covered by the new program.
   The Universal Access pool would be financed by all employers and
by all individuals not covered by Medicare who have incomes above
150 percent of the poverty level. The schedule of fees would be
designed to encourage employers to offer coverage to employees and
improve coverage under some existing plans.
   ``There is strong incentive to keep the pool of people falling
into the public system as small as it can be,'' Reinhardt said.
   Under the current system, the millions who are uninsured, though
they cannot pay for their health care, still do receive medical
services, he noted. Their cost, however, is borne largely by
hospitals and doctors that provide the care, and it inflates
insurance premiums paid by companies for their workers, he said.
   ``There would be some shifting of costs from large firms who do
offer generous health insurance packages to those who in some sense
freeload and do not offer their employees any health insurance and
thereby benefit. Their employees are implicitly covered anyhow and
big business picks up the tab,'' Reinhardt said.
   Under the proposed system, employers who don't provide a minimum
level of health insurance coverage to their full-time workers would
have to pay a fee for each worker not covered. In addition, all
employers and employees would have to pay a fee based on employees'
income. The rates would be determined once a national package of
basic services was developed.
   The commission also proposed a $500 million-a-year research
program funded with the health care fees to study the effectiveness
of current medical procedures. Such research could reduce
inappropriate care and waste while saving at least $1.5 billion a
year by 1993, the commission said.

   Artist Jasper Johns, whose works
command millions at auction, has been inducted into his native
state's hall of fame.
   Johns, an Allendale native considered a father of pop art, is the
first artist among 39 people enshrined in the South Carolina Hall of
Fame at the Myrtle Beach Convention Center.
   Also inducted Monday was Joel Roberts Poinsett, best known for
bringing the Christmas plant that bears his name to the United
States.
   Johns was overseas, but his mother, Jean Riley Lee, attended
Monday's ceremonies. She said his paintings' high prices are
``wonderful for him,'' adding: ``But, what I'm so glad about is he's
alive to know about it himself. So many artists didn't know they
ever became famous.''
   Johns, 58, is best known for his paintings of familiar objects
such as flags and numbers.
   George Vogt, executive director of the South Carolina Department
of Archives and History, described Poinsett, who lived from 1779 to
1851, as ``a renaissance man'' _ a congressman, state lawmaker,
chairman of the South Carolina Board of Public Works and ambassador
to Mexico.
   It was during his service in Mexico that Poinsett brought back
the poinsettia.

   Former Miss America Vanessa Williams said she
was surprised by all the publicity the NBC-TV movie ``The Sex
Tapes'' received during filming.
   The film in which she plays a prostitute surrounded by
sadomasochism is really just a detective movie with a kinky
background, she says in this week's TV Guide.
   ``Well I guess it's a combination of the subject matter and the
cast,'' said Ms. Williams, who lost her Miss America crown in 1984
after nude photos of her were published in Penthouse magazine.
   She said she had no qualms about her role.
   ``You know, it's amazing how many people have asked me whether I
have a problem playing a hooker,'' she said. ``No, I don't. My
character's motivation is good. She's a girl on the run for her

   Actor Don Johnson, who portrays the hard-nosed
but flashily dressed ``Miami Vice'' undercover cop, has apprehended
a suspect in real life.
   He nabbed an intruder in a hotel room as the man rifled through
the purse of his fiancee, actress Melanie Griffith, police said
Monday.
   Johnson, 39, discovered the intruder when he and Miss Griffith
opened the door to their room at the Hotel Bel-Air on Sunday night,
said police Capt. Clayton Mayes. The purse contained expensive
jewelry, but the couple surprised the man before anything was taken,
Mayes said.
   ``Don Johnson took the suspect into custody and held him until
hotel security officers could detain him until police arrived,''
Mayes said.
   Arrested and booked for investigation of attempted burglary was
David Johnson, 34, no relation to the actor, Mayes said.
   Miss Griffith, 31, received a Golden Globe award Saturday night
for best comic actress for her performance in the movie ``Working

urging the Utah Legislature to generously finance programs for the
handicapped.
   Kim, 37, whose real name remains confidential, spoke to the House
on Monday and demonstrated remarkable mental skills that allow him
to recite long passages from books and films he has seen, or compute
the correct day of the week for virtually any date on the calendar.
   ``The work of love is really important. We need lots more money
to carry our work on together. We want you to support us in our

   The occasion for Kim's remarks was the House's passage of a
resolution honoring him for ``being a role model for other
handicapped persons, and for helping to educate the public regarding
the handicapped and their rightful place in society.''
   The filmmakers also used as their model Joseph Sullivan, a West

<TEXT>
   North Dakota farmer Luther Berntson stood
before an audience at the Department of Agriculture and spoke what
he admitted sounded like heresy: Lock the plow in the barn, he
advised, and farm without tilling.
   ``My neighbors say it is sacrilege, unpatriotic and everything
else,'' he said. ``It was the plow that opened the prairie. Thomas
Jefferson made improvements to the plow. Why, the plow is mentioned
in the Bible.''
   Yet what Berntson advocated wasn't heresy here. He was a
participant in a Agriculture Department conference Monday on a new
breeze in farming _ low-input agriculture.
   That's maximum farming with minimal disturbance to nature,
farming with seed, soil and manure and as little chemistry as
possible.
   The movement is similar in some respects to ``organic'' farming,
although many low-input practitioners find they can't stay in
business without using herbicides and other chemicals scorned by
their more dogmatic counterparts.
   With drought blowing the topsoil away, the cost of petrochemicals
skyrocketing and farmers coming under the scrutiny of the
Environmental Protection Agency for polluting groundwater, the
Agriculture Department decided to take a fresh look at low-impact
farming.
   Keynoter Will Erwin, an Indiana farmer, said public impatience
has given urgency to the cause.
   He summed up the public's attitude toward farmers this way: ``We
paid you not to produce so much and you used chemicals and
fertilizers to produce more, and spoiled the environment to boot.''
   With his topsoil only six inches deep and more blowing away every
time he plowed, Berntson, a third generation wheat farmer in
northeastern North Dakota, started no-tillage farming 10 years ago,
raising wheat and barley from acres that normally get a mere 18
inches of rain a year.
   Does it pay off?
   The jury is out, he said. Farming his way is costly and still
requires a lot of herbicides to control weeds, doing what his
locked-up plow once did.
   He puts so much stuff on the weeds, he said, that ``we say we are
plowing with a can and a jug.''
   As for his neighbors, ``They are not quite ready to go to
no-till, and maybe they're smarter than I am.''
   The Agriculture Department spends just $3.9 million of its $25
billion annual budget on ``alternative agriculture.'' Tom Brown, a
west-central Nebraska farmer, pleaded with it to do more.
   Brown, who raises corn and soybeans with three sons on 3,300
acres, said he, too, has parked his plow, ``and if this makes me a
good guy, I guess I qualify.''
   He's a member of the Sierra Club, but he can hardly be called a
low-input farmer, he said.
   To get corn yields of 150 to 200 bushels per acre, this is what
he pours onto each acre: $24 in seeds, $51 in fertilizer, $18 in
herbicides, $12 in insecticides and $50 to $60 worth of electricity
to run the irrigation system.
   ``We know this is wrong,'' said Brown, ``but we don't know what
else to do about it because we still have to make a living. I belong
to a lot of organizations that recognize the problem. But I have to
make a living.''

<HEAD>Brown's Last Opponent for Dem Party Chief Drops Out</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Jim Jones' withdrawal from the race
for chairman of the Democratic National Committee clears the field
for former Jesse Jackson aide Ronald Brown to assume the top party
job next month.
   Jones became the last opponent of Brown to drop out of the race
Monday, when he conceded Brown had enough votes on the 404-member
committee to assure his election next week.
   ``I don't see prolonging a campaign that is outvoted,'' Jones
said.
   Brown's election to the top Democratic Party job was assured last
week when three other rivals for the post dropped out and endorsed
him. Although Jones briefly continued his challenge, Brown claimed
he had enough votes to win and there was near-unanimous agreement
within the party that he did.
   The Democratic National Committee meets in Washington on Feb. 10
to select a new chairman to replace Paul Kirk, who is giving up the
job.
   Jones, a former congessman from Oklahoma, said he spoke with
Brown on Sunday and congratulated him for winning.
   Brown was Democratic National Convention manager for presidential
hopeful Jackson last year. Some of Brown's opponents had cited his
ties to Jackson, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo as evidence he would give ammunition to Republicans
trying to paint the Democrats as too liberal.
   Brown met over the weekend with Jewish leaders in Denver in an
attempt to put to rest concerns about his views on Israel, which
were raised because of his association with Jackson.
   Jones, in announcing his withdrawal, said he would still address
the DNC members during their two-day meeting in Washington and would
continue efforts ``to move the party to a more centrist position.''
   He said Brown ``has to take some steps that will show true
independence'' and display a commitment to winning back Southern and
Western voters to the Democratic Party.
   He warned that the party is perceived by many as too liberal,
that voting trends are moving against Democrats and that they could
lose control of Congress and find themselves a true minority party
in coming years.
   ``The Democratic Party could go the way of the British Labor
Party unless we make some fundamental changes in our message and
image,'' he said.
   ``If the Democrats keep sweeping under the rug the fact that we
are losing moderate voters, that we're losing adult white male
voters, that we're losing white and ethnic minority young voters, if
we keep sweeping those statistics under the rug and failing to face
up to them, we are really buying our own doom,'' Jones said.

   Oh, the perks of the presidency. When George
Bush sets up his horseshoe pit at the White House, he won't have to
use plain old horseshoes.
   No, Bush will get shoes befitting a president, not a horse.
Cousins Morrie and Don Wheeler, who own the 80-year-old Wheeler
Brothers Brass Foundry, have made Bush some solid brass, engraved
horseshoes.
   The shoes were forged, ground and polished to 2 pounds, 10
ounces, regulation weight for the National Horseshoe Pitchers
Association.
   ``They really turned out to be quite an impressive casting,''
said Bob St. Germain of Averill Park, a woodworker who made the
patterns for the shoes out of mahogany. ``They look like they're
solid gold.''
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-New York, is planning to deliver the
horseshoes to Bush.
   ``I think he'll appreciate these,'' said St. Germain. ``He
probably gets all kinds of gifts, but these have a lot of real
people in them. ... It's something we've worked on together.''
   Morrie Wheeler said he expects the horseshoes will make an
impression on the president.
   ``It's something nobody would buy for just themselves,'' he said.
``And they'll last forever.''

   No need to hold your nose. A new organization
of skunk lovers says the animals make wonderful pets once their
ability to create a stink is removed.
   ``These are the most misunderstood animals in the world,'' said
Jane Bone, a national authority on skunks. ``In the state of
Georgia, there has never been a documented case of rabies in
domesticated skunks.''
   So maybe rabies isn't what some people had in mind. But the new
members of Skunks as Pets Inc. say they've taken steps to ensure
that their pets are, uh, socially acceptable.
   Pet skunks are de-scented at an early age and are incapable of
any olfactory assaultism, they say.
   About 30 people met Sunday to organize an Augusta-area chapter of
the skunk organization. As they talked, their pets _ Stinky, Daisy,
Barney, Pudgy and friends _ made themselves at home, ambling around
and checking things out.
   Ms. Bone said pet skunks are not wild animals. In fact, Skunks As
Pets, which is beginning to register skunks much like the American
Kennel Club does dogs, will not recognize a black and white skunk
unless it can be proven the animal is domestic.
   Consequently, the skunks at the meeting were either albinos,
which have been bred domestically for more than 100 years, or
``chocolates,'' which have been bred for 40 to 50 years.
   Ms. Bone was quick to point out that the animals aren't for
everyone _ particularly children under age 12 _ and that they
require conscientious care.

   Opera lovers aren't going to like this, but
talent agent John Shea won tickets to a Broadway play by singing the
aria to ``Gilligan's Island.''
   Yes, that's right. Asked to sing at least 16 bars from any opera,
Shea broke into the renowned ``Gilligan's Island'' theme _ and won
his tickets. ``I don't know any opera,'' he explained.
   Neither did a lot of other people who showed up Monday morning at
the Royale Theater to win tickets to the first preview of ``Lend Me
a Tenor,'' a new comedy revolving around a performance of Verdi's
``Otello.''
   The theater offered tickets to the first 100 people who could
sing a bit of opera. Among the borderline offerings: ``Summertime''
from ``Porgy &amp; Bess'' and Frederick's song from ``The Pirates of
Penzance.''
   Others, like ``Gilligan's Island,'' were clearly beyond the pale.
Among them were ``I Dreamed a Dream'' from ``Les Miserables'' and
``I Don't Know How to Love Him'' from ``Jesus Christ Superstar.''
(``It's an opera,'' insisted Nancy Nisselbaum, who sang the latter.
``A rock opera.'')
   Finally, there were actual, real, bona fide opera selections.
Jeanette Murawski drew a round of applause for ``Vissi d'arte'' from
Puccini's ``Tosca.'' Other selections came from ``Carmen,''
``Rigoletto,'' ``Faust,'' ``La Boheme,'' ``Madama Butterfly'' and,
yes, ``Otello.''

<HEAD>DC Appeals Judge Starr Apparent Nominee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservatives applauded and liberals took a
wait-and-see attitude toward the Justice Department's recommendation
of federal appeals court judge Kenneth W. Starr as the new U.S.
solicitor general.
   Justice Department sources confirmed Monday that Starr, 42, had
been recommended to President Bush to becme the government's chief
appeals lawyer, arguing cases before the Supreme Court and deciding
whether to appeal lower court decisions against federal agencies.
   White House spokesmen said Monday they did not know when Bush
might nominate Starr, but a Justice Department source, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said: ``I understand it's a done deal. Bush
hasn't done anything on it, but we wouldn't have recommended it
formally if we didn't think it suited his personnel people.''
   The nomination would be subject to Senate confirmation.
   Starr, born in Vernon, Texas, has been on the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia since Oct. 11, 1983. Before
that, he had been a clerk for former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger,
a partner with the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher,
and counselor to former Attorney General William French Smith.
   He had previously been mentioned as a possible Supreme Court
nominee after the 1987 retirement of Justice Lewis Powell.
   Starr was unavailable for interviews Monday, his secretary said.
   Kenneth Cribb, a top aide in Reagan's White House and in former
Attorney General Edwin Meese III's Justice Department, said Monday
that Starr ``would make an excellent solicitor general.''
   ``I found him to be quite compatible with the conservative
judicial philosophy of the Reagan administration in all matters,''
said Cribb, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
   Bruce Fein, a conservative columnist and attorney who was
associate deputy attorney general during President Reagan's first
term, said in a November 1988 column that Starr ``epitomizes the
Reagan judicial legacy.''
   Fein said Monday that virtually all of Starr's written opinions
``have been earmarked by conservative instinct, yet open-mindedness.
There's no ideological fervor.''
   But liberals expressed some wariness.
   ``We're looking at the nomination very cautiously,'' said Susan
Liss, legal director for People for the American Way.
   ``I think the most interesting thing about Starr's selection is
that it gives the administration another seat in the D.C. Circuit to
fill,'' she said. ``Starr has been a less reliable conservative than
the Reagan administration may have hoped when it selected Starr to
sit on the court.''
   One seat on the appeals court, Robert Bork's, already is open.
Bork resigned after the Senate rejected Reagan's nomination to place
him in the Supreme Court.
   To Colleen O'Connor of the American Civil Liberties Union,
``Starr is a question mark.''
   However, she added, ``All the signals that have come out of the
Bush administration's Justice Department do not seem all that
different from what we've seen in the past.''
   In some recent cases, Starr has joined with other judges to
uphold First Amendment rights.
   In other cases, he helped overturn court-imposed limits on the
District of Columbia's prison population and helped throw out the
D.C. Fire Department's affirmative action hiring plan.
   Starr received his bachelor's degree from George Washington
University in 1968, got a master's from Brown University in 1969 and
graduated from Duke University Law School in 1973.
   If approved, Starr would succeed Charles Fried, who has left the
solicitor office to return to Harvard University Law School.

<HEAD>VA Employees Disciplined for Being too Cozy with Drug Companies</HEAD>

   Thirty-two medical employees of the Veterans
Administration have been disciplined for accepting money and other
gratuities from drug companies doing business with the agency.
   The VA said Monday that its department of medicine and surgery
took the action as a result of a three-year investigation by the VA
inspector general into dealings between VA doctors and other
employees and five pharmaceutical suppliers.
   The actions were for the acceptance of travel expenses, speaking
fees, grants or consulting fees, and for being absent from work
without taking vacation to do the outside work, the VA said.
   The probe began after an earlier investigation into dealings by
another drug company resulted in disciplinary actions against 34 VA
physicians and other employees in 1987.
   In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the VA's
office of inspector general said that in the latest actions one
employee was suspended, 29 received admonishments and two received
reprimands, which are more serious than admonishments.
   In three other cases no action was taken because the employees
resigned.
   Six cases were referred to the Justice Department, which decided
against prosecution in four of them, in most cases citing lack of
criminal intent. The other two cases remain under consideration.
   In addition, the agency provided counseling to 18 employees and
issued instructional letters to 473 employees _ steps that were the
result of the investigation but are not considered disciplinary
actions.
   The inspector general withheld names of the employees involved.
   In a written statement, the VA said the employees violated
regulations or policies concerning actual or apparent conflict of
interest through the improper acceptance of money or other
gratuities. Many of the cases involved VA doctors or other employees
attending or speaking at meetings and symposiums sponsored by the
companies.
   Assistant Inspector General Jack H. Kroll said the investigation
has not been closed and that actions involving several VA employees
have not been completed.
   Investigative reports released by the inspector general said that
in one case, a VA doctor employed part-time received fees and
expenses totaling over $175,000 from Eli Lilly &amp; Co., and for two
years had a $10,000 a year consulting agreement with Lilly.
   During that period he served as chairman of a VA hospital's
formulary committee, a panel that selects drugs for use by the
hospital.
   In another case, a VA employee received speeking fees amounting
to $35,050 and expenses of $14,018, and was absent from work for 335
hours, the agency said. In still another, an employee received
honoraria from two companies on 79 occasions, including fees of
$38,250 and expenses of $34,018.
   In addition to Lilly, companies involved were Ciba-Geigy Corp.,
Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals Inc., Merk-Sharp &amp; Dome, and Abbott
Laboratories.
   The original investigation involved payments by Smith Kline &amp;
French Laboratories.
   Both investigations involved activities in 1981 through November
1985.
   Donna St. John, spokesman for the VA's department of medicine and
surgery, said that following the initial investigation the VA took
steps to ensure employees were familiar with regulations and
policies prohibiting certain dealings with private companies.
   The VA, which in March will become the Department of Veterans
Affairs, operates the nation's largest hospital system and has
194,000 employees.

   The dogwoods may not be blooming at Camp David
this spring because of a devastating fungus disease that the
Agriculture Department says could become a national epidemic among
the native trees.
   USDA plant geneticist Frank S. Santamour said Monday that the
disease has swept through native dogwood seedlings at a test site
near the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains. The
seedlings were from 17 states and proved highly susceptible to
anthracnose disease.
   ``They all declined in vigor, and after two years 75 percent were
dead,'' Santamour said. He predicted that all of the test seedlings
will be dead by the end of 1989.
   Santamour, who works for the department's Agricultural Research
Service at the National Arboretum in Washington, said no North
American flowering dogwood trees of the species Cornus florida are
known to resist the disease.
   Asiatic or Chinese dogwood, Cornus kousa, which produces flowers
similar to C. florida, showed some leaf spotting from the disease
but otherwise were said to have performed well in Santamour's study.
   The fungus that causes dogwood anthracnose has not been
identified exactly, he said. But there appears to be no insect
carrier of the fungus, as with Dutch elm disease. The dogwood fungus
depends on wind and water to spread from tree to tree.
   Santamour said the origin of the disease outbreak is obscure. It
began in the late 1970s on the West Coast among C. nuttallii
dogwoods and the C. florida on the East Coast, he said.
   ``However, we can probably rule out environmental stress as a
casual factor,'' Santamour said.
   A 1984 survey of nearly 50,000 dogwoods in Catoctin Mountain Park
by the U.S. Park Service and USDA's Forest Service confirmed
scattered reports of the new devastating disease among the native
dogwoods.
   Santamour there is probably little hope for finding native
dogwoods resistant to anthracnose.
   Dogwoods in the study were grown from seeds from Alabama,
Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, New Jersey, North
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

   It's long past time for scoffing at so-called
low-input farming and its reduced use of fertilizers, pesticides and
weedkillers, say a growing number of experts, including senior
Agriculture Department officials and many others.
   Will Erwin, an Indiana farmer and a member of the federal Farm
Credit Assistance Board, said Monday that so-called low-input,
sustainable agriculture _ called LISA by advocates _ does not mean
returning to the era of horse power and manual labor on the farm.
   ``We cannot look back, we cannot look at it as going back,''
Erwin told the conference.
   But there are some good reasons _ economic and environmental _
for farmers to trim back on some of the the items they use, such as
fertilizer and pesticides. And the manner in which those items are
used.
   ``There is a growing force in our society that says to farmers
that we paid you not to produce while you used chemicals and
fertilizer to produce more and more _ and we want lower cost
programs and a safer environment,'' he said.
   The concept of low-input, sustainable agriculture has been around
for a long time. It has grown since the energy crunch of the 1970s,
and as environmental issues such as soil and water pollution have
taken a deeper hold.
   Congress in the 1985 farm law authorized USDA to conduct research
and education programs in ``alternative farming systems,'' often
referred to as low-input or sustainable agriculture. In 1987,
Congress appropriated $3.9 million to push the LISA concept.
   The two-day conference at the department attracted about 150
registrants to hear farmers and other talk about their experiences
with low-input production methods. More than 100 of those registered
represented special interest groups, USDA agencies and other federal
offices.
   Vivan Jennings, deputy administrator of the Extension Service,
called LISA ``an issue whose time has come'' but cautioned that no
one should expect miracles.
   ``We should recognize it's not a panacea,'' Jennings said. ``It's
not going to solve all of our problems, and we need to remember that
as we move ahead.''
   Luther Berntson, a North Dakota farmer who uses the low-input
approach for years on his 2,000-acre operation, said that federal
farm programs helped put production agriculture into a rut.
   ``I don't need to remind you that the government farm programs of
the past have not rewarded the best management practices,'' he said.

   The Agriculture Department says the nation's
egg production totaled 5.82 billion eggs in December, down 4 percent
from a year earlier.
   Fewer hens were on hand in December, some 273 million birds
against 286 million in Dec. 1987, a report said Monday. But those
worked harder, averaging 2,131 eggs per 100 hens, compared with
2,116 a year earlier.

   Severely depressed patients not only see the
light but turn from SAD to glad while wearing an unusual hat fitted
with two fluorescent tubes, according to researchers who hope to
help millions with the device.
   The invention is a hat that looks like a pith helmet with the two
tubes placed parallel to the eyebrows. It was designed as a
portable, wearable way to treat patients suffering from a severe
form of winter depression dubbed seasonal affective disorder, or SAD.
   ``Almost everyone I know can't stand February and looks forward
to spring,'' said Dr. George Brainard, a neurologist who along with
biomedical engineer Dan Benson developed the hat at Thomas Jefferson
University.
   But, he said, the victims of SAD have an ``outright lack of
energy and an inability to cope.''
   SAD is characterized by withdrawal, social isolation, depression,
a craving for carbohydrates, weight gain, a tendency to sleep longer
and fatigue. People with SAD generally improve as springtime's
sunnier days grow closer.
   Scientists estimate that SAD severely afflicts about 10 million
Americans. About 25 million experience a milder form of the
disorder. Most of the cases occur in the northern states, where days
are shorter.
   Researchers have found that exposure to bright light, or
phototherapy, alters the production of the hormone melatonin and
relieves the depression.
   Brainard said researchers believe the therapy works because light
directed into the eyes stimulates a region of the brain called the
hypothalamus, which controls production of hormones, including
melatonin.
   How light works to alter hormone production and relieve
depression is not known, he said.
   The two, 6-inch lights _ five times as bright as the light in a
well-lit room _ fit under the brim of the hat, which is attached by
a cord to a battery pack worn on a shoulder strap.
   Brainard and Benson designed the first prototype two years ago.
This month, they began testing the hat on six patients with SAD and
hope to treat up to 20 this season.
   ``In 85 percent of SAD cases, light therapy has caused a
significant improvement or complete relief of all symptoms,'' said
Brainard.
   But most patients can't spend their days outside in bright
sunshine. The light hat enables people to fit the phototherapy into
their busy lives by wearing the hat at home.
   Patients wear the hat for about two hours a day, usually in the
morning, said Dr. Karen Stewart, director of Jefferson's SAD clinic.
   ``A portable device makes it possible for a person to receive
therapy and still maintain a regular morning routine,'' she said.
   Patients using conventional phototherapy must spend one to five
hours daily in front of a fluorescent light box. The bulky light box
weighs about 25 pounds and patients often complain about scheduling
the therapy around jobs and family.
   ``You can't really carry them on an airplane,'' Brainard said.
   Five of the six patients using the hat have responded to the
treatment, Ms. Stewart said.
   ``One responded so well that even after she was withdrawn (after
a week of wearing the hat), she hasn't relapsed into depression in
three weeks,'' she said.
   The patient who didn't respond was physically ill at the time and
will test the hat again.
   Other scientists also are working on similar projects.
   Dr. Thomas Wehr of the National Institute of Mental Health in
Rockville, Md., said he and his collegues designed several
prototypes of a ``light visor'' two years ago and found it extremely
effective in treating SAD.
   ``We had trouble getting the devices back,'' he said.
   Wehr said he was aware of at least one or two other groups
working on similar devices and his group is continuing development
of a lighter version.
   Both groups have applied for patents.
   The knowledge gained through the clinical testing of the light
hat will further Brainard's research for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration on artificially lit environments, such as
the space shuttle.
   Brainard said that as humans and animals spend increasingly
longer time in space, researchers are concerned about how the body
can react adversely to artificial light.
   His research is financed in part by the space agency to design
and develop lighting systems for the shuttle and the planned space
station.

<HEAD>Suit Filed to Block Use of Animal Genes in Human Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge is being asked to block the
first application of genetic engineering using an animal virus gene
in the experimental treatment of human cancer.
   The request is contained in a U.S. District Court lawsuit filed
Monday by the Foundation on Economic Trends and its president,
Jeremy Rifkin.
   It asks for an injunction to block plans by researchers at the
National Institute of Health to use a rat virus to manipulate a gene
in an experimental treatment of melanoma, a virulent and often fatal
skin cancer.
   The suit claims that the institute's Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee, which reviews human genetic engineering experiments,
approved the cancer therapy without conducting proper public
hearings.
   As the suit was being filed in downtown Washington on Monday,
Rifkin and others in the foundation met with the 25-member committee
at the institute's offices in Maryland for a heated discussion of
Rifkin's proposal that the NIH be required to form a citizen's
committee to evaluate dangers involved in human genetic engineering.
   Members of the institute's advisory group voted 23-0, with two
members abstaining, against forming the citizens committee. Rifkin
vowed to ``come back again and again and again'' with his proposal.
   The lawsuit asks the court to block the first formal attempt ever
to insert a foreign gene into human beings.
   The suit targets research approved earlier this month to treat
melanoma patients with a type of white blood cell, called a tumor
infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL), that has been genetically altered.
   TIL cells are developed by the body in small numbers to fight the
growth of melanoma tumors.
   Three NIH researchers, Steven A. Rosenberg, R. Michael Blaese and
W. French Anderson, showed in earlier work that TIL cells can be
used to battle cancer by taking them from a patient's tumor, growing
them in large numbers in the laboratory, and then reinserting them
into the patient. In results published in December, the technique
was at least partially successful in 12 of 20 patients.
   To understand why TIL therapy works for some, but not others, the
scientists want to trace the white blood cells after they are
returned to the patient. In order to do this, the researchers want
to mark the cells with a bacterial gene that produces a resistance
to neomycin, an antibiotic. In this way, cells from the patient's
tumors or blood stream could be identified and movement of the cells
into the tumors could be monitored.
   But in order to get the gene of the bacteria into the white blood
cells, the scientists proposed to use a rat leukemia retrovirus. It
was the use of this virus that triggered the lawsuit.
   The study proposed that the experimental therapy be used on 10
melanoma patients with a life expectancy of just 90 days, and that
it not be used on other patients until the technique is re-evaluated.
   The research proposal underwent seven months of reviews,
including hearings by NIH committees, the Food and Drug
Administration and a congressional committee. On Jan. 18, James B.
Wyngaarden, director of the NIH, gave final approval.
   In their lawsuit, Rifkin and the Foundation on Economic Trends
say the approval was not proper because a subcommittee review of the
proposal was not conducted with public notice and public
participation, and that final approval by the full committee was by
a mailed ballot, instead of in a public hearing.
   A court clerk said the case has been assigned to the court of
U.S. District Judge John G. Penn. No hearing had been scheduled
Monday, but the clerk said it would probably be sometime this week.

<HEAD>Bush's 1984 Report Took Middle Road on S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush isn't talking yet about his plan
to restructure the savings and loan system, but the report of a
study group he headed as vice president may preview his approach.
   If the 1984 recommendations of the Task Group on Regulation of
Financial Services are any indication, Bush will take a cautious
approach rather than advocate a wholesale restructuring of the
industry.
   The 1984 report recommended maintaining a separate system for
S&amp;Ls, at least in the near term, but allowing S&amp;Ls to become banks
as their activities and services grew more bank-like.
   And, rather than calling for a return to old restrictions, the
group emphasized a system of incentives _ including risk-based
insurance premiums and higher capital levels _ to encourage S&amp;Ls to
operate safely.
   Bush's staff director for the task group, Washington attorney
Richard Breeden, joined the White House staff last week and is
expected to play the key role in shaping the administration's S&amp;L
plan.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that the
president hopes to outline the plan in a Feb. 9 speech, although he
may not have all the details by then.
   Much has changed since Bush signed the task group report. But,
although the magnitude of S&amp;L insolvencies had not yet come to
light, the study recognized what since has been identified as a key
contributor to the problem: permissive laws in some states that
allowed S&amp;Ls to stray into risky areas far removed from their
traditional business of making home mortgage loans.
   Rather than force S&amp;Ls to revert to their traditional form, the
Bush group recommended risk-related insurance premiums, requiring
institutions entering new areas to pay more into the government
insurance fund than conservatively run S&amp;Ls. Currently all S&amp;Ls pay
the same premium.
   Higher levels of capital also would discourage excessive risks,
it said. The owner of an S&amp;L with low capital levels has little to
lose and much to gain from taking a big risk, while the taxpayers
who are the ultimate backers of insured deposits have much to lose
and nothing to gain.
   The task force recommended that S&amp;L capital levels be brought up
to the stricter standards applied to commercial banks. That is now
being done, but won't be in full force until 1991.
   Contrary to the current thinking of most analysts, Bush's group
advocated that federal regulators turn over some of their authority
to the states _ but only to states whose regulatory systems met
federal requirements.
   That would create an incentive for states to develop stronger
regulatory programs, it argued. As a guard against states whose
standards slip, it said federal insurers should be permitted to
revoke the insurance of state-regulated institutions.
   Currently, there are two schools of thought regarding the future
of the S&amp;L industry. One, advocated by the chief industry lobby
group, the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, contends that
thrifts should remain distinct from commercial banks, but that they
ought to stick primarily to mortgage lending.
   The other school says there's no longer a need for a separate
industry. It notes that commercial banks and mortgage firms owned by
non-financial companies such as Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. have entered
home mortgages in a big way thanks to government-chartered agencies
which buy mortgages and repackage them into securities for sale to
investors.
   The Bush task force steered a middle course. It recommended
retaining the Federal Home Loan Bank System for thrifts and keeping
three separate insurance funds: for banks, thrifts and credit unions.
   But it offered a mechanism for the financial system to evolve.
Thrifts that stuck primarily to mortgage lending would remain part
of a separate system. At a certain point, S&amp;Ls that entered enough
new areas, becoming more like banks, would have to join the bank
regulatory system with its stricter regulation.

<HEAD>Mexico Seeks Information That Mmay Link Officials to Drug Trafficking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mexican government has asked U.S. officials
to provide information that allegedly links top Mexican law
enforcement officials to narcotics trafficking, The Washington Post
reported today.
   The paper said former Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
shortly before leaving office, asked U.S. law enforcement agencies
to provide ``any credible information'' on the matter, the Post said.
   The newspaper reported the new Mexican government of President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari asked for the information, a request that
some U.S. officials fear could compromise sensitive U.S.
intelligence sources in that country.
   Shultz, in a Jan. 13 letter obtained by the Post, said a senior
Mexican government official had pledged that ``appropriate
investigations and actions would be taken'' if the request was
fulfilled.
   Shultz said, however, that the Mexicans needed the information
``before it was made public in the press'' because the Salinas
government ``could not be perceived as responding to U.S. media
allegations.''
   The letter, which the Post said has not been answered by any U.S.
agency, is the latest development in a growing dispute between U.S.
law enforcement officials and the State Department over the new
Mexican government's commitment to cracking down on drug trafficking.
   The Post said some U.S. officials have expressed concern that
some of Salinas' top appointees, particularly in the attorney
general's office and other law enforcement agencies, may have ties
to major Mexican drug traffickers or have not shown full commitment
to eliminating drug-related corruption.

<HEAD>Loophole in Election Law Moves Toward Closing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress are moving to close a
custom-made loophole in federal election laws allowing some of them
to keep unspent campaign funds, a potential personal bonus of up to
$1 million each.
   The loophole, which was written to help ensure passage of the
1980 election law, has since lost some of its popularity in
Congress. Repealing the provision is now part of a package of
legislation related to a pending 50 percent pay raise.
   ``It's an embarrassment to them,'' Norman Ornstein, a political
analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, said Monday. ``It's
the sort of question not too many members who were there before 1980
want to have asked of them.
   ``I think it's a foregone conclusion that they'll do away with
it.''
   More than $61 million in surplus campaign funds is sitting in the
accounts of 191 House members and 71 senators who were in Congress
when the law was passed. A ``grandfather clause'' in the law allows
them to convert the money for personal use, an action forbidden for
those who came to Congress later.
   On the average, House members who were grandfathered in hold
about $224,000 in their campaign accounts, while senators, whose
campaigns usually are considerably more costly, have an average of
$341,000, according to FEC records.
   ``I didn't go out and spend all the money because that's not the
way I operate my own home,'' said Rep. Larry J. Hopkins, R-Ky. ``I
spend what I think is appropriate to win.''
   Hopkins, who cruised to re-election on a 3-to-1 margin last year,
had $604,824 left over in his campaign account, according to records
at the Federal Election Commission.
   That puts him in 10th place among members of the House.
   The top spot in the House belongs to Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.,
with more than $1.1 million. Solarz is co-sponsor of a bill that
would abolish the grandfather clause.
   The House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., has more than $1 million _ up from $596,000
since January 1987 _ and has not expressed an opinion on the issue
of abolishing the loophole, according to an aide.
   In the Senate, the list is topped by Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
with nearly $2.1 million and Phil Gramm, R-Texas, with $1.9 million.
However, those amounts are not unusually big war chests since both
those senators face re-election campaigns next year.
   The legislation now before each house would eliminate the
possibility of letting the grandfathered members convert leftover
funds to their own uses but would continue permitting conversion for
the other uses allowed under the law.
   Candidates for Congress can use leftover campaign money to
support political organizations or other candidates. In addition,
members of Congress can use the money to ``defray any ordinary and
necessary expenses'' arising because of their position.
   And, unlike the House, the Senate has a rule forbidding its
members from converting their campaign money for personal use,
although it does not have the force of law and its effect on former
senators or their survivors is unclear.
   Proposals to abolish the exemption in both the House and Senate
have come up as members of Congress are about to pick up 50 percent
pay raises, boosting salaries from $89,500 to $135,000 annually for
rank-and-file lawmakers.
   Hopkins said Monday that he kept his campaign treasury stocked
with cash because he represents a largely Democratic district and he
doesn't want to borrow.
   ``You will never see Larry Hopkins holding one of these dumb fish
frys at $25 a head to retire a campaign debt,'' he said.
   He offered to give back money over the next month to ``anybody
who donated to my campaign last time and is not satisfied. Please
contact me, and I will send the money back.''

<HEAD>Drug Testing Program Blocked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has blocked a random
drug-testing program at the Interior Department, calling it an
example of ``bureaucracy run amok'' that would deprive thousands of
people of their fundamental right to privacy.
   The program, which would have taken effect today, would require
17,000 of the agency's 70,000 employees to be tested for drug use.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene granted a preliminary
injunction sought by the National Federation of Federal Employees.
   In his 36-page opinion, Greene said the program is ``essentially
a show ... in which the civil servants employed at the Interior
Department are the involuntary players.''
   The program was aimed at those who were considered to be holding
jobs sensitive enough to require drug testing. The department's
definition of sensitive positions included clerical assistants, mail
and file clerks, auditors, cartographers and printing press
operators.
   Greene said such designation of routine job holders ``as being
all in sensitive positions is bureaucracy run amok.''
   Greene said the government's goals ``do not justify a significant
intrusion into an employee's privacy, particularly when there is
absolutely no showing that drug use exists that is impairing the
routine functions, let alone the critical responsibilities, of the
department.''
   Greene said the program would deprive thousands of citizens of
fundamental privacy rights, ``not because anyone actually suspects
that they are drug users, but because they are employees of the
government whom that government believes it can command on that
account to repair to the toilets, so that it is able thereby to
demonstrate its commitment to the war on drugs.''
   The program had been envisioned by former Interior Secretary
Donald Hodel as a model for the government.
   Greene did not enjoin the department from testing employees on
``reasonable suspicion'' of drug use. And, the lawsuit did not
address the department's recent policy requiring drug tests of job
applicants, including secretary-designate Manuel Lujan Jr., who was
the first tested under that policy.

<HEAD>Former Sheriff Threatens Suit Against ``Mississippi Burning'' Producers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON HARRIST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawrence Rainey, the sheriff when three
civil rights workers were slain in rural Neshoba County in 1964, is
demanding a retraction from the producers of ``Mississippi Burning.''
   ``They didn't use my name but nobody in Mississippi or any other
state has any doubt they intended that sheriff to be me,'' said
Rainey, 65, now employed as a security officer in Meridian.
   ``We will be mailing a demand letter for a retraction on Tuesday
and that's a prerequisite for a lawsuit under Mississippi law,''
said his attorney, James McIntyre.
   Rainey was acquitted on charges of violating the civil rights of
the three workers in a federal trial at which he was represented by
McIntyre.
   McIntyre said the film ``mixes fact with fiction and depicts
Rainey as terrorizing citizens of Neshoba County. It depicts him as
being a person bent on violence and it is not an accurate, fair
account of what did happen in Neshoba County in 1964.''
   On June 21, 1964, James Earl Chaney, 21, who was black, and
whites Andrew Goodman, 20 and Michael Schwerner, 24, disappeared
after they were released from the county jail in Philadelphia. They
had been stopped for speeding after investigating a church burning
by the Ku Klux Klan.
   Their bodies were found 44 days later in a soggy earthen dam in
rural Neshoba County. All three had been shot to death.
   Alan Parker's ``Mississippi Burning,'' an Orion Pictures release,
is loosely based on the murders. The film, which stars Gene Hackman
and Willem Dafoe, has drawn both praise from movie critics and
criticism from blacks who contend it gives the FBI too much credit
in the civil rights struggle.
   Rainey maintains his innocence and said the movie had subjected
him to ridicule.
   ``The character in the movie was a big man like me and he chewed
tobacco like I chewed tobacco all the time,'' said Rainey, who works
for a black-owned security firm.
   ``Everybody knows it was made off the happenings in Neshoba
County,'' he said Monday. ``The actor had twice as big a crew of
tobacco as I ever had but they might have well as called him
Lawrence Rainey.''
   Rainey, who served as Neshoba County sheriff from 1964 to 1968,
said he had lost a security job in 1975 following a movie based on
the civil rights violence in Mississippi.
   ``I've got a good relationship with blacks,'' he said. ``I'm
working for a black man and a black company but he is getting a lot
of feedback for working me.''
   The former sheriff said he wanted McIntyre to proceed with a
damage suit immediately because ``of the way it has hurt me and is
going to hurt me.''
   ``If they say `We are sorry for what has happened and it isn't
true,''' McIntyre said, ``that still does not negate a cause of
action, it only mitigates the damages.''
   McIntyre noted that of the 18 individuals brought to trial on
charges of conspiring to violate the victim's civil rights, only
Rainey and a few others were found innocent. Seven were convicted
and given sentences ranging from three to 10 years.
   Calls to Orion Pictures were not answered late Monday afternoon.

<HEAD>Brady Meets with Wright, Rostenkowski on Thrift Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is reaching out to
congressional Democrats on the S&amp;L crisis after creating a furor
over a plan to charge depositors a fee for federal insurance of
their savings and checking accounts.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who floated the idea of a
depositors' fee last week in meetings with congressional
Republicans, met privately Monday with House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, and other key Democrats to stress other options being
considered.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee, quoted Brady as saying during the meeting
in Wright's office that President Bush has made no decisions on any
of the alternatives.
   ``Everybody's looking for the path of least resistance,''
Rostenkowski said. ``There's no solution that's not going to be
painful.''
   Industry and government experts say the cost of closing insolvent
thrift institutions while protecting their depositors against losses
would range from $90 billion to more than $110 billion over the next
10 years.
   The alternatives include issuing $25 billion to $60 billion in
bonds, some of it backed directly by the government or through
raising the premiums that banks and savings and loan associations
now pay for federal insurance.
   ``The healthy institutions won't be for increased premiums,''
Rostenkowski said.
   But he added that the idea of charging depositors about $2.50 for
each $1,000 in their checking or savings accounts in federally
insured institutions ``is as flat as a pancake.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that Bush
hopes to spell out plans for dealing with the savings and loan
crisis in his Feb. 9 budget address to Congress but might not be
ready with details by then.
   Fitzwater said Bush and other administration officials will
continue to seek advice from members of Congress despite complaints
by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu that lawmakers had leaked
discussions of a fee on deposits.
   ``Consultations are a very important part of the process,''
Fitzwater said. ``President Bush has been reaching out to Congress
in many forms. We would expect that to continue.''
   Sununu had suggested on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David
Brinkley'' on Sunday that certain members of Congress may have
violated the administration's trust in leaking word that the
depositor fee was being considered.
   Fitzwater said such a fee _ which some critics say would violate
Bush's no-new-taxes pledge _ remains an option.

<HEAD>Quayle Echoes Early Reagan in Criticism of Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle told religious
broadcasters that ``the gospel'' of Vladimir Lenin still pervades
the Soviet Union and the United States must be realistic in dealing
with that communist nation.
   Speaking Monday to the National Religious Broadcasters, Quayle
said the Soviet Communist Party had over the years gained an
``appalling confidence in its own wisdom, indeed, its own
omniscience.''
   ``I think the root of the matter all comes back to a hatred of
God, to a rejection of the entire concept of a religious system,''
he said.
   Comparing the American revolution with the communist revolution
in Russia, Quayle said, ``Look how much good has come into the world
as a result of the first revolution and how much evil has entered
the world because of the second.''
   Bush is addressing the group Wednesday.
   Quayle's comments, somewhat reminiscent of Ronald Reagan's
rhetoric in the early days of his presidency when he called the
Soviet Union an ``evil empire,'' differed in tone from recent Bush
remarks concerning the Soviets.
   Bush has used less harsh wording, but has urged a cautious
approach to U.S.-Soviet relations, which were improving as Reagan's
term came to an end.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Quayle's
comments were not inconsistent with administration policy.
   Quayle quoted Lenin, the leader of the 1917 Communist Revolution,
as saying the idea of God is ``unutterable vileness ... of the most
dangerous kind.''
   ``That was Lenin and unfortunately his gospel is still actively
pursued in the Soviet Union,'' Quayle said.
   On the other hand, Quayle said the U.S. founding fathers had a
``belief in the existence of a Creator whose laws have placed
irrevocable limits on the power of the state.''
   He also said that if Moscow's planned 1991 international human
rights conference occurs, the United States must ensure that it ``is
not just a public relations extravaganza for the Soviet leadership.''
   President Bush has said he would follow through on Reagan's plan
for U.S. participation in the conference, but also has said U.S.
officials will be watching Soviet human rights performance in the
interim.
   Talking about his trip this week to Venezuela and El Salvador,
Quayle said, ``My message will be democracy, democracy and more
democracy,'' he said.
   Quayle is not expected to make any policy initiatives during the
trip but plans to meet with a number of heads of state who will
attend Thursday's inauguration of Venezuela's new president, Carlos
Andres Perez.

<HEAD>New Regulations Aim at Protecting Patients' Rights, Improving Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's 15,000 nursing homes will have to
meet higher standards of care and give patients more say in their
treatment, under new regulations for Medicaid and Medicare
reimbursement.
   The final regulations, announced Monday, cap several years of
efforts by the Health Care Financing Administration to meet the
terms of a law passed by Congress in 1987 to improve the quality of
nursing home care.
   ``These regulations change our focus in regulating nursing homes,
away from looking to see merely if a facility has the capacity to
deliver care, to looking at the quality of care that is actually
being delivered,'' said Dr. William L. Roper, HCFA administrator.
   Among other things, the regulations will:
   _Give patients the right to refuse treatment, manage their own
money, receive visitors, manage their own privacy, express
grievances, be free of physical restraints and not be transferred or
discharged against their will.
   _Offer patients services needed to treat specific conditions and
guard against such things as inappropriate weight gain and loss and
bed sores.
   _Require nursing homes to have 24-hour nursing capability,
including a registered nurse for eight hours of every day.
   _Require facilities to train nurses' aides, provide dental,
vision and hearing care, and offer an activities program by a
qualified professional.
   The final regulations will apply to nearly 15,000 long-term care
facilities. The rules are open to a 90-day comment period and most
will go into effect 90 days after that. The rest will go into effect
Oct. 1, 1990.
   The American Health Care Association, which represents licensed
nursing homes and long-term health care facilities, generally
endorsed the regulations, but expressed concern about the length of
time it is taking to put them in place.
   The group also is concerned that ``if there is not adequate
funding for them, they won't have the impact they were intended to
have,'' said Linda Keegan, a spokeswoman for the association.
   The American Nursing Association said it was ``extremely
concerned at the disregard for the quality of care'' in the
regulations.
   Lucille Joel, president of the nursing association, criticized
the rules for permitting HFCA to waive a requirement that a
registered nurse be on duty for eight hours a day, seven days a week.
   The Health and Human Services agency has proposed no criteria on
which to grant waivers ``and has implied that the waivers may be
used as a way to cut the budget for Medicare and Medicaid nursing
home programs,'' she said.
   Tom Hoyer, director of provider service coverage policy at HFCA,
said the law allows waivers only when a nursing home can't find
nurses to hire and would be granted only if quality of care were not
affected. The agency will be issuing proposed rules for waiver
requirements in the next couple of months, he said.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Combined Drug, Hormone Treatment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new drug therapy can extend the lives of men
with advanced prostate cancer by nearly 25 percent, according to a
study on which the Food and Drug Administration based its approval
of the new treatment.
   The FDA on Monday approved the new hormone-blocking drug
flutamide for use in combination with another drug that affects
hormone production in patients whose prostate cancers are in the
most advanced stage.
   The drug will be marketed under the trade name Eulexin by the
Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison, N.J.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young cautioned that ``flutamide is not
a cure,'' but he said a National Cancer Institute study
``demonstrated how it can be used to extend the lives of some men.''
   Young also stressed that when detected in the early stages,
prostate cancer can be treated successfully.
   ``These prostate cancers generally need not get to this stage _
if every man over 40 would have a simple rectal exam each year,''
Young said.
   Cancer of the prostate, a walnut-size gland at the base of the
male bladder, is the third leading cause of cancer deaths among
American men. It kills more than 25,000 men annually and about
100,000 new cases are reported each year, the FDA said.
   The disease often develops with no noticeable symptoms. Warning
signs can include difficulty in urinating, frequent urination and
presence of blood or pus in the urine or semen. These are the same
symptoms that mark prostate infections and a benign enlargement of
the prostate that is common in older men.
   In its early stages, the disease can be treated successfully by
removing all or part of the prostate or by radiation. But if the
cancer spreads to other tissue and organs, chances of successful
treatment diminish considerably.
   The NCI study involving 617 men with advanced prostate cancer
showed that flutamide, in combination with the previously approved
drug leuprolide, extended survival by nearly 25 percent. Patients
receiving the two drugs survived an average 34.9 months, seven
months longer than the group that received leuprolide alone, the FDA
said.
   The drug has been in clinical development for 15 years and is
marketed in 34 countries, Schering-Plough said.
   The drug works by blocking the spread of cancer cells in the
prostate as well as in surrounding tissue.
   Scientists believe the male hormone testosterone stimulates
proliferation of cancer cells by a diseased prostate. Leuprolide
stops production of the hormone by the testes, and flutamide is
believed to inhibit the hormone's action on cancer cells by blocking
the receptor sites that testosterone uses in the cells, the FDA said.
   Side effects of the combined therapy included hot flashes in 61
percent of the patients, loss of libido in 36 percent, impotence in
33 percent, diarrhea in 14 percent and nausea and vomiting in 12
percent, the agency said.

<HEAD>Review Sought of Bridge-Inspection Rule Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Highway Administration is being
asked to rethink its decision to require bridges to be inspected
every four years instead of every two years, as previously required.
   An auto safety advocacy group and relatives of people killed in a
1987 New York bridge collapse said in a petition filed Monday,
``FHwA failed to obtain crucial information relevant to the decision
and consequently could not make a knowledgeable analysis of the
effects of less frequent bridge inspections.''
   The new rule was passed in August and affects about 122,000
bridges nationwide.
   The federal agency ``has issued the final rule despite the
documented inadequacies of state bridge inspection programs covering
576,000 bridges,'' Clarence M. Ditlow III, executive director of the
Center for Auto Safety, said in a letter accompanying the petition
that asks the agency to review the rule change.
   Also filing the petition were relatives of three people who were
among 10 killed when the Schoharie Creek bridge on the New York
State Thruway fell into the Schoharie Creek on April 5, 1987, after
days of rain and flooding.

<NOTE>Study Says Electric Power Shortages Possible in 1990s</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. power companies must build more generating
capacity than currently planned or the nation may face an
electricity shortage in the 1990s, a trade group says.
   Based on conservative projections of growth in electricity
demand, the nation will need an additional 50,000 megawatts of
generating capacity by 1997 in order to avoid a shortage, a newly
published American Gas Association study said Monday.
   That amount would be needed in addition to the 32,500 megawatts
of capacity currently under construction, the study said.
   Using an assumption of faster electricity demand growth over the
next decade, which the gas group said it considered to be more
realistic, an additional 105,000 megawatts of plant capacity would
be needed to avoid shortages.
   The study said 71 percent of capacity additions planned in the
1979-88 period were canceled.

   Handgun manufacturers and sellers would be
liable for injuries and deaths caused by the weapons, under a new
proposal by the District of Columbia City Council.
   The proposal ``is designed to force gun manufacturers to consider
carefully the purposes for which handguns are manufactured,'' said
Council Chairman David Clarke, the bill's sponsor.
   Sponsors of the legislation said it will be the first of its kind
in the nation.
   The plan would hold handgun manufacturers, importers and dealers
liable for damage caused by handguns, in the same manner that some
states hold tavern owners or party hosts liable for injuries caused
by drunken drivers.
   The bill is supported by 12 of the 13 council members in a city
whose officials are worried about a rising murder rate.
   January is already the bloodiest month in city history, with 49
killings through Monday. The highest yearly total was set in 1988
when 372 people were killed in the nation's capital.

<HEAD>FCC Proposes Lottery for Awarding Radio, TV Station Licenses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission is trying
to abandon the method it has used for the past quarter century to
grant radio and television licenses in favor of a random lottery.
   The FCC decision Monday to scrap the old comparative licensing
process was immediately criticized by a media watchdog group, which
said the commission was abdicating its decision-making
responsibility and closing what has been a means of access by
minorities and women to broadcast ownership.
   In voting 3-0 to dump the old process, commissioners called it
slow, costly and not guaranteed to determine the best applicant.
Under the old system, would-be owners must prove their worthiness to
hold a broadcast license.
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said the lottery is ``faster ...
arguably more equitable.''
   The FCC said the lottery process would be less costly to
applicants, and therefore, ``would lower entry barriers and
encourage newcomers to enter the broadcast industry.''
   But Andrew Schwartzman, executive director of the
Washington-based Media Access Project advocacy group, said the
lottery proposal was ``an outrageous, last-ditch effort to
substitute a roll of the dice for government officials defining and
implementing the public interest.''
   ``It's spitting in the face of minorities and women and
experienced broadcasters and instead it's going to bring in the
buccaneers on the night flight from Las Vegas,'' Schwartzman said.
   Schwartzman claimed that when Congress in 1982 gave the FCC the
power to use the lottery process, it did not envision it being used
for full service broadcasters.
   The commission previously has instituted lottery procedures to
award licenses for low-power TV stations and cellular telephone
operations.
   The comparative process conducts hearings to compare applicants
on factors ranging from the extent to which applicants would
diversify media ownership, the degree to which media owners would be
integrated into station management, whether such owners were local
residents or minorities and the degree of differences in the area in
populations to be served.
   Administrative law judges then grant preferences to applicants on
each comparative factor. The applicant with the best comparative
record receives the license, pending appeals _ a process the FCC
said may take anywhere from three years to five years.
   Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis said the lottery would preserve
two major items of the comparative hearings: credit for
diversification of ownership and minority ownership.
   ``I think that what we've set up in this item will insure that
minority applicants and those with no other broadcast interests will
do at least as well under a lottery as they would have done under a
comparative hearing,'' she said.
   She said that under the current system, one applicant in most
cases will buy out a competing applicant during the challenge
process, and the FCC merely approves the settlement.
   ``I'm told that 80 percent of all our cases settle, and in those
cases we then play absolutely no role in enforcing our comparative
criteria,'' Dennis said. ``So the applicant with the worst
comparative qualifications can simply buy out the other applicants
and we will routinely approve the settlement.''
   She said she was concerned about how the public benefits ``by
having applicants pay each other $65,000 to $70,000 even before they
begin to build a station.''
   The proposal will be open for public comments following its
official publication in about two weeks, the FCC said.

<HEAD>Surrogate Mother, Couple Who Split Up Wage Three-Way Battle For Custody</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman who gave up her baby girl under a
surrogacy agreement and the couple who intended to adopt the infant
but then got divorced are waging a three-way court battle over
custody of the child.
   The fight, further complicated by the fact that the sperm donor
is not the man seeking custody, centers on blond-haired, brown-eyed
Tessa, now 4 years old, biological daughter of Norma Lee Stotsky.
   In January 1985, the day-old girl was given to Richard Reams and
Beverly Seymour, a married couple who paid Mrs. Stotsky $10,000 and
expenses under a surrogate mother agreement.
   The marriage broke up a year later, before the couple started
adoption proceedings.
   The legal entanglements began a short while later in juvenile
court in Columbus when Mrs. Stotsky, Reams and Ms. Seymour
petitioned for custody.
   Subsequently, Reams filed an adoption petition with Mrs.
Stotsky's consent, prompting Ms. Seymour to file one of her own.
   Legal and personal complications have delayed a decision in the
case and put the child and her future at risk, according to Mrs.
Stotsky's attorney, Patricia Grimm.
   ``I honestly feel for all three of these people. They all love
her,'' she said. ``My client is pursuing this for the benefit of
Tessa. She wants to make sure she gets a good home.''
   Despite their clients' differences, Ms. Grimm; Tessa's
court-appointed attorney, Charles Milless; and Reams' attorney, Kim
Halliburton, agree on one thing: Tessa is bound to get hurt.
   ``It really is a legal ping-pong game,'' said Ms. Halliburton.
``Unfortunately, Tessa is the ball.''
   Milless said his goal is to protect Tessa from pain.
   ``Any child involved in a custody battle is an unfortunate child.
Overall, she's in pretty good shape. We have protected her, or tried
to, from publicity,'' he said. ``I'm not so sure that she
understands all of this.''
   A court-ordered paternity test revealed that a sperm donor other
than Reams was Tessa's biological father, despite what Ms. Grimm
said was a ``gentleman's agreement'' among the three parties that
Reams would be the father.
   Although the donor, a former colleague of Mrs. Stotsky's, has
waived any claim to the child, both would-be adoptive parents and
Mrs. Stotsky have not.
   All three filed custody petitions in juvenile court, but a
complicating factor is that Ohio has no law governing surrogacy
contracts.
   The custody requests were put on hold while the question of
petitions for adoption, filed by Reams and Ms. Seymour, was debated.
   Reams and Ms. Seymour temporarily lost their separate efforts to
adopt Tessa last week when Probate Judge Richard Metcalf dismissed
their adoption petitions primarily on the grounds that the two had
failed to post required $3,000 bonds.
   The order moves the case back to juvenile court, where custody
and financial support will be determined, Milless said.
   Reams likely will appeal Metcalf's decision, Ms. Halliburton said.
   ``If his rulings are not reversed, a choice will have to be
made,'' she said. ``This child, who loves both of her parents and
who truly believes that they are her parents, will be awarded to one
of them.''
   Ms. Grimm said another married couple is interested in adopting
Tessa, but has yet to formally enter the case.
   All three attorneys indicated they would fight any attempt by an
outside party to adopt the girl.
   Ms. Grimm said Mrs. Stotsky is undecided about whether to
continue her pursuit of custody once the case goes back to juvenile
court.
   Ms. Seymour could not be reached for comment on the case because
she has an unlisted telephone number.
   Tessa, now a ward of the juvenile court, splits her time each
week between Reams and Ms. Seymour, who live in separate towns near
Columbus.
   Although Tessa knows Mrs. Stotsky, she is unaware that she is her
biological mother, said Ms. Grimm.
   Milless said he has no plans to appeal Metcalf's ruling because
he believes adoption may not be right for Tessa.
   ``I see no reason that one person should be allowed to adopt as
opposed to the other. Adoption freezes the others out of the life of
the child,'' he said.

   Prices for raw materials all over the world
reached their highest level for the 1980s last year, according to
figures collected by the World Bank.
   It calculated that the drought in this country pushed the average
price of wheat to $168.90 a metric ton, or $4.69 a bushel, last
month, compared with an average of $112.10 a metric ton, or $3.11 a
bushel, in 1987.
   Big demand by the industrial countries of east Asia helped raise
the price of copper to a record $3,498.90 a metric ton, nearly $1.20
a pound, the World Bank said Monday.
   The average rise for a long list of commodities was 10.2 percent
for the year. That brought the overall level to just a little _ 2.8
percent _ above the average for the years 1979 to 1981.
   Problems of Third World countries have been aggravated in recent
years by low prices they have been getting for the products of
fields and mines, their chief source of foreign income. For some,
things are now improving.
   Aluminum, nickel, rice, sugar, bananas, fats and oils were all up
for the year. Timber, cotton and oranges were down.
   In addition to the Arab countries of the Middle East, oil is a
major export for Nigeria, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Indonesia and
others. Chile benefits doubly: from the rise in the copper price and
the drop in the oil price, because oil is a big import.
   The average oil price in 1988 was $13.60 a barrel compared with
$17.20 a barrel in 1987, and the price dropped as low as $11.60 a
barrel in the fourth quarter of 1988. However, oil prices increased
steadily in December, reflecting growing market confidence in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' November decision to
set a production ceiling of 18.5 million barrels a day, according to
the report.
   Penelope Hartland-Thunberg, trade expert at the independent
Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that commodity
prices go in short-term cycles, now up and now down. But the long
term trend is now toward a decline as new inventions come into use
and fewer raw materials are used for each dollar of goods produced.
   Ron Duncan, chief of the World Bank's Commodities Division,
pointed out that there is sometimes a wide spread even within
individual commodities. High quality arabica coffees from the
highlands of Brazil, Colombia and Jamaica are being bought more and
more in western Europe, he said.
   The report credited the reintroduction of export quotas under the
International Coffee Agreement as helping raise the price of
arabicas by 20 percent in 1988.
   That meant a shift away from the lower grade robusta coffees
grown nearer the sea in West Africa and Indonesia. Their prices were
down by 8 percent.
   Duncan also emphasized the uneven effects of price movements.
   ``The newly industrialized countries in Asia are importing feed
for pigs and poultry,'' he said. ``That pushes up the price of grain
up for the low income countries of Africa, which have to buy more
because they're producing less themselves and there's less foreign
aid available.''
   West Africa countries, especially the Ivory Coast, are suffering
from low prices for both their coffee and cocoa.

<HEAD>`Night Stalker' Trial Begins After Jury Hears Gruesome Outline Of
Slayings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The lead witness in the ``Night Stalker''
trial described finding the nearly decapitated body of his mother,
whose slaying was the first of 13 blamed on the man who terrorized
California four years ago.
   ``There was a neck gash as if someone tried to remove her head
and almost succeeded,'' Jack Vincow said of his 79-year-old mother,
Jennie.
   ``The sight of my mother's head almost removed was just too much
to deal with.''
   The trial of Richard Ramirez was scheduled to resume today with
more testimony from Vincow, who discovered his mother's body in her
apartment on June 28, 1984.
   During his opening statement Monday, Deputy District Attorney
Philip Halpin gave a detailed account of each of the slayings, using
an enlarged Los Angeles County map as a guide.
   The prosecutor called for the death penalty against Ramirez, a
shaggy-haired drifter from El Paso, Texas, who was chased down by a
mob and arrested in the summer of 1985.
   Halpin did not emphasize the satanic or ritualistic aspects of
the serial murders. He let sensational aspects of the crimes speak
for themselves and delivered a low-key outline of the crimes that
will be recounted for the Superior Court jury during the trial.
   ``This is where your work begins,'' he told the panel.
   Defense attorney Daniel Hernandez reserved his opening remarks
until after the prosecution concludes its case, which Halpin said
would take four months.
   Ramirez, 28, is charged with 13 slayings and 30 other felonies
stemming from the crime spree.
   The unpredictable defendant, who once shouted ``Hail, Satan!'' in
court, was subdued in the packed courtroom Monday and sat slumped in
his chair.
   Dressed in a dark gray suit and sunglasses, he was shackled at
the ankles as a security measure. The shackles were kept from sight
of the jury.
   Halpin described how the ``Night Stalker'' killed his victims
through a combination of shooting, slashing and bludgeoning. Most of
the female victims were raped, sodomized and often asked to ``swear
to Satan.''
   Although the prosecutor said satanic symbols were found at some
murder scenes, he hinted the real motive was burglary.
   He said the killer told his victims virtually the same thing:
``Where's the money? Don't look at me. Shut up.''
   Halpin said the prosecution will prove its case through
fingerprints lifted from crime scenes, ballistics tests and
eyewitness testimony.
   ``Makes you scared to go home at night,'' muttered spectator
Nancy Vgoretz of Los Angeles as she left the courtroom.
   ``I heard so much about him. ... I had to see him in person,''
she said, adding, ``I'm fascinated.''
   Ramirez was arrested after he was captured by an angry East Los
Angeles mob on Aug. 31, 1985, the day his picture appeared in
newspapers for the first time identifying him as the alleged ``Night
Stalker.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen
Tuesday while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange reversed
morning declines to close slightly higher.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which had lost
64.05 points at the end of the morning session, closed 13.80 points,
or 0.04 percent, higher at 31,581.30. The index lost 111.57 points
Monday.
   The dollar ended trading at 129.13 yen, down 0.60 yen from
Monday's close of 129.73 yen. The currency opened at 129.59 yen and
moved between 129.05 yen and 129.63 yen.
   The dollar's lower opening in Tokyo followed a decline in New
York Monday when traders who had bought dollars Friday sold for
profit taking, dealers said. The dollar closed at 129.30 yen in New
York Monday, down from last Friday's finish of 129.43 yen.
   ``In Tokyo, market players were not making any major moves except
for some position adjustments, and many of them remained on the
sidelines trying to determine the future of the dollar-yen rate,''
said Minori Takeuchi of the Chemical Bank.
   However, she said, the currency's slight loss Tuesday morning did
not signal a reversal in the trend toward a stronger dollar. Trading
was also thin because of the lack of market-affecting news, Ms.
Takeuchi said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei index, the market's main
barometer, opened lower despite gains in the Dow Jones industrial
average in New York.
   Traders said institutional investors were cautious due to
fluctuations in the dollar-yen rate on foreign exchange markets.
   Trading was directionless in the absence of major
market-affecting incentives, said one trader with a major securities
firm in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   Seven army personnel including two officers
were killed when an army helicopter crashed in a jungled valley near
the Thai-Burmese border, a police officer said today.
   The transport helicopter was traveling from Mae Sot district of
this border province to a nearby military base in Phitsanulok
province, said Lt. Col. Lamchuan Keotai, Tak's deputy police chief.
   Lamchuan quoted hilltribes people as saying they saw the
helicopter catch fire before plunging to the valley floor.
   The officer quoted the pilot as informing the control tower in
Tak province by radio that due to heavy fog over the mountains he
would increase his altitude from 2,200 feet to 2,500 feet. Contact
was then lost with the craft.
   The cause of the crash was under investigation, the officer said.
   A rescue team including two helicopters and two L-19
reconnaissance aircraft found the wreckage in a densely forested
valley, Lamchuan said.

<HEAD>Authorities: Two Arrested in Chemical Weapons Shipments To Iran And
Iraq</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An American businessman and a Dutch national
have been arrested for diverting shipments of an industrial
lubricant to Jordan for use as a chemical weapon by Iraq,
authorities said.
   Besides announcing the arrests, U.S. authorities said Monday that
a Baltimore-based company agreed to plead guilty to one count of
violating export laws in connection with the export of thiodiglycol.
   The lubricant, used in inks and textiles and sold under the brand
name Kromfax, produces lethal mustard gas when combined with
hydrochloric acid.
   Nicholas J. Defino, 64, of New Jersey and Dutch citizen Frans Van
Amraat, who was apprehended in Milan, Italy, on Jan. 26, were
charged with conspiracy, listing phony destinations on export
documents and violating U.S. export laws.
   Defino surrendered to Customs Service agents in Baltimore on
Monday and was released on bond after appearing before a magistrate.
Van Amraat is awaiting extradition.
   The chemicals, manufactured by Alcolac International Inc. of
Baltimore, were illegally shipped to Iran and Iraq by separate
agents during 1987 and 1988, said U.S. Attorney Breckinridge L.
Willcox.
   The two men were accused of shipping the chemical to Belgium then
to Jordan. From there, the chemical was transported to Iraq, said
Willcox.
   Four shipments, each weighing more than 100 tons, were sent to
Western Europe in 1987 and 1988, but at least three wound up in
Iraq, according to the federal complaint.
   Last year, a West German pleaded guilty to purchasing a component
of mustard gas from Alcolac and shipping it via Greece and Singapore
to Iran.
   DeFino conducted business with Alcolac through Nu Kraft
Mercantile Corp. of New York City, purchasing the more than 400 tons
of the chemical, authorities said. Van Amraat was the European agent
for Nu Kraft, authorities said.
   Willcox said Defino is vice president of United Steel and Strip
Corp. of New York.
   Alcolac officials said the chemicals were sent to the Middle East
without their knowledge.
   ``That was not my understanding,'' said Willcox, who refused to
elaborate.
   Alcolac Vice President Jack Rubin said the company was unaware
the chemicals were going to the destinations other than the European
points listed on shipping documents. He said the company has
cooperated fully with federal investigators.
   One former employee filled out the shipping documents in a way
that ran afoul of the complex provisions of the Export
Administration Act, Rubin said. The employee did not know the
eventual destinations, he said. Willcox declined to say whether the
worker would be charged.
   ``No one within this company had any indication that these
materials were going to be diverted to the Iran-Iraq war zone,''
Rubin said. ``We feel just awful that one of our products was
misused for that end use.''
   The federal investigation previously led to the arrest in July of
Peter Walaschek, a West German employee of Chemco G.m.b.h., who
purchased three shipments of the chemical during 1987 and 1988 for
shipment to Greece and Singapore and then re-exported them to Iran,
Willcox said.
   Walaschek pleaded guilty to violating American export law for
arranging the shipments. After initially agreeing to cooperate with
prosecutors as an informant, Walaschek fled the country, forfeiting
a $350,000 bond, authorities said.
   Willcox said talks were continuing with West German officials
about extraditing Walaschek.
   Chemco had purchased thiodiglycol at the direction of Sexed
Kharim Ali Sobhani, an Iranian diplomat stationed in West Germany,
The New York Times reported Sunday.
   Under American law, exporting the chemical requires a license.
Shipments to Iran, Iraq and Syria are barred.
   Chemco purchased three shipments of thiodiglycol from Alcolac and
90 tons were delivered to Iran in 1987 and 1988, Willcox said. A
later shipment of 120 tons was intercepted by Customs investigators,
who substituted water for the chemical and then traced their travels
to Iran, authorities said.
   One ton of thiodiglycol produces about a ton of mustard gas. One
hundred tons would cover about 50 square miles.

   Pakistani officials are willing for the first
time to agree to verification that they are not building nuclear
weapons if they are permitted to buy U.S.-made reactors for power
production, says a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who brought the proposal back from a
recent trip to Pakistan, said Monday it deserves serious
consideration and he will hold hearings on the idea in his Asia
subcommittee.
   Solarz said ``key'' Pakistani officials had endorsed the
reactors-for-safeguards swap but declined to say which ones. During
his stay in Islamabad he met with new Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and army Chief of Staff Gen. Aslam Beg,
among others.
   Under the proposal, Pakistan would agree to some form of
negotiated verification process to ensure that its nuclear program
is put only to peaceful uses, and is not devoted to weapons
development.
   Pakistan's nuclear intentions have been a source of friction in
past relations with the United States, although U.S. policy-makers
sought to put those concerns aside in recent years because of
Pakistan's cooperation in funneling weapons to the anti-Soviet
rebels in neighboring Afghanistan.
   Now that Soviet troops are being withdrawn, however, the nuclear
issue has come back to the forefront of relations between the two
countries. Administration officials have said U.S. aid to Pakistan
may be cut off after Sept. 30 because President Bush will not be
unable to certify that the Pakistanis have not developed a nuclear
weapon.
   Further details of the Pakistani weapons program were reported
Monday by CBS, which said nuclear materials made in the United
States found their way to Pakistan through by way of West Germany.
   The network said heavy water from the U.S. Savannah River weapons
reactor complex near Aiken, S.C., was sold to a West German company
and was processed 15 to 20 years later into the tritium gas used to
build nuclear warheads. Then, after being sold and resold, it
reached another West Germany firm, NTG, which shipped the gas to
Pakistan, CBS said.
   Pakistan is receiving $230 million in military aid and $215
million in economic aid from the United States this year, making it
the third largest beneficiary of U.S. aid after Israel and Egypt.
   Solarz said an agreement that would provide safeguards against
Pakistani weapons development could not only head off a prickly
showdown over U.S. aid, but it also could facilitate a budding
reconciliation between Pakistan and neighboring India.
   ``If the United States is willing to sell nuclear reactors for
peaceful nuclear energy, Pakistan would agree to establish
full-scope safeguards on all their nuclear facilities, including
existing ones,'' Solarz said in describing the proposal made by
Pakistani officials.
   ``If we can cap the Pakistani nuclear program at its present
level, that would represent a very significant and constructive
development.''
   Pakistan in the past has refused to cooperate in international
inspection procedures under a non-proliferation treaty. Bhutto said
recently that her country will not sign the international treaty
unless India does too.
   Solarz noted that Pakistan's relatively high level of U.S. aid
was based on its key role in supporting the Afghan rebels, and that
the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan would lessen the
need for military aid. But he said there might be a greater need for
economic aid than in the past.
   The Reagan administration, in its 1991 budget proposal, asked
that military aid levels to Pakistan be increased to $240 million
and economic aid be increased to $250 million.

<HEAD>Track Athletes Kill Six, Wound One In Fujian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two track-and-field athletes using starter pistols
killed six people and wounded another for unknown reasons before
police killed one of them in a shootout, a newspaper reported today.
   The official China Sports Daily said 300 armed police officers
surrounded a building in the sports center in the southern city of
Fuzhou on Monday and exchanged shots with Shang Weidong, a 110-meter
hurdler, and Li Zhichuan, who specializes in the decathlon.
   Shang died in the shootout and Li was wounded, the newspaper said.
   The incident began Sunday morning when Shang and Li met three
acquaintances and asked them for $540. The report said it was not
clear why the two men asked for the money, but their request was
refused.
   An official at the Fuzhou city police department said ``women
were involved in the incident'' but declined to elaborate. China has
recently seen a rise in prostitution, especially in the richer
cities along the country's coast.
   The pair went to the room of their three acquaintances later that
afternoon, crashed through the door and began firing, killing the
three acquaintances, the paper said.
   The pair then locked themselves in the room. A short while later,
two men and two women entered.
   Li and Shang killed three of them and seriously wounded the
woman, the paper said. They then fled to the provincial sports
center, where several close friends, also track-and-field athletes,
helped them hide.
   Early Monday morning, police found Li and Shang hiding in the
attic of the five-story building. After a stand-off of almost three
hours, police killed Shang and captured Li in a quick shootout, the
report said.
   It was not clear how Li and Shang obtained live ammunition for
the starter pistols as it can not legally be bought in China.

<HEAD>Warsaw Pact Publishes Figures, Claims Near Parity with NATO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has published its most detailed
breakdown ever of Warsaw Pact conventional forces in Europe in an
effort to rebut Western claims that the Soviet bloc has a clear
advantage over the NATO alliance.
   The breakdown in Monday's edition of Pravda, the Communist Party
newspaper, did not however account for differences between East and
West over how to interpret the figures.
   Those differences have for 15 years stymied negotiations on
reducing conventional forces in Europe.
   In its statement, the Soviet bloc acknowledges having twice as
many tanks in Europe as NATO _ far below the 3-1 advantage alleged
by the West _ but claims the West has the advantage in attack
aircraft and personnel.
   Hence, the Soviets asserted, the strength of the two sides is
about equal.
   Western experts did not agree.
   ``It is clear that the idea of a rough parity of forces in Europe
does not correspond to the factual situation,'' said Henry Sloan, a
spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Gen. John Galvin, the alliance's American military commander,
declared: ``I definitely do not agree that a rough parity of
conventional forces already exists in Europe.''
   Warsaw Pact defense ministers said in a statement that the
figures add up to ``rough parity'' in conventional forces. They said
the Western alliance has issued ``tendentious data based on a
selective approach.''
   New negotiations on conventional forces are to begin March 7 in
Vienna. Those talks were given a boost Dec. 7 when President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev said the Kremlin would reduce the Red Army by half a
million soldiers by 1991.
   Moscow also says it will get rid of 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery
systems and 800 combat planes.
   The other Warsaw Pact countries _ Romania, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany and Poland _ have also
announced cuts in their military forces.
   Pravda's report said the 16-nation NATO alliance has 2.1 million
ground troops in Europe facing 1.8 million from the Warsaw Pact
countries, and 685,000 sailors in nearby seas compared to only
338,000 for the East bloc.
   NATO contends the Warsaw Pact has 3.1 million ground troops,
while the alliance has 2.2 million.
   The Pravda report acknowledged a 2-1 Warsaw Pact advantage in
tanks, and its tables also showed a heavy advantage for the East in
armored personnel carriers and combat infantry vehicles.
   A Western analyst in Moscow said privately that the Warsaw Pact
appeared to have tailored the categories of forces to support its
long-standing contention that the sides are about equal.
   He noted that NATO contends the Eastern alliance has qualitative
superiority in virtually every major weapons system.
   Sample comparative figures illustrate the differences in strength
estimates.
   The report in Pravda says the Warsaw Pact has 59,470 tanks to
30,690 for NATO, but the Western alliance says the figures are
51,500 to 16,424.
   Although the Soviets say the West has a dramatic advantage in
strike aircraft and helicopters, NATO says the Warsaw Pact has a
comfortable edge.
   Warsaw Pact figures say NATO has superior numbers of ground
troops, air forces, navy personnel, strike aircraft, helicopters and
large surface ships, while the East is ahead in tanks, tactical
missile launchers, interceptor aircraft, artillery and infantry
vehicles and armored personnel carriers.
   In its November report on troops in Europe, NATO said the East
had more soldiers, main battle tanks, armored infantry fighting
vehicles, artillery, anti-tank weapons, air defense systems,
helicopters, combat aircraft and armored vehicle launched bridges.
   That report did not include naval forces, which NATO said ``are
capable of global deployment, and this makes it artificial to
identify specific numbers of ships associated with any one region.''
   Analysts generally feel the West has a qualitative edge in
tactical aircraft and naval forces, neither of which is to be
included in the Vienna negotiations.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has chosen former
Soviet prisoner and human rights activist Natan Sharansky to be
Israel's new ambassador to the United Nations, a senior government
official said today.
   News of the choice raised concern among some Israeli diplomats
about the possibility of offending the Soviet Union at a time when
relations with Moscow, broken off more than 20 years ago, are
improving.
   A senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Shamir's selection of Sharansky was expected to get the
necessary approval from Finance Minister Shimon Peres, head of the
left-leaning Labor Party.
   Labor shares power with Shamir's Likud bloc in the coalition
government.
   Sharansky, 41, served nine years of a 13-year sentence in Soviet
prisons and labor camps on charges of spying. He was released Feb.
11, 1986 as part of an East-West prisoner exchange and flew
immediately to Israel to join his wife, Avital.
   He was arrested in 1977 after angering the Soviet authorities as
an outspoken leader of the Jewish emigration movement and for
maintaining numerous foreign contacts.
   Sharansky also belonged to a human rights watch committee headed
by Andrei Sakharov that was sharply critical of Kremlin policies
toward prisoners and national minorities.
   The outspoken Sharansky, interviewed today on Israel army radio,
would not comment on the report, saying only he had not been
officially offered the job.
   Pressed by the interviewer, Sharansky added: ``I will say only
what I want to say. I have enough experience with interrogations and
I know how to give answers. I have had no formal proposal.''
   Israel radio said Shamir's surprise choice of Sharansky followed
a recommendation from former U.N. Ambassador Benjamin Netanyahu, now
deputy foreign minister and a legislator of the right-wing Likud
bloc.
   Israel has not replaced Netanyahu since he left the post last
year.
   The government official said the process of appointing Sharansky
could be delayed as Israeli diplomats study the Soviet Union's
response.
   ``Now that we're on the eve of renewing diplomatic ties, on such
a delicate time in our relations with Moscow, it could take some
time to determine whether this would not offend them,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union, one of the first countries to recognize the new
state of Israel in 1948, severed diplomatic ties during the 1967
Middle East war when Israel seized lands from Moscow's Arab allies.
   Ties have warmed over the past two years, with both countries
exchanging low-level diplomats or consular officials.
   Since arriving in Israel, Sharansky has lobbied to improve
conditions for Soviet immigrants. He also changed his first name
from the Russian Anatoly to the Hebrew Natan.
   Sharansky has turned down bids to join any of Israel's major
political parties. He and his wife have two daughters _ Rachel, 2,
and Hannah, two months.
   Soviet Jewry activists praised the choice of Sharansky for the
U.N. post.
   ``This is a good way for Israel to use his talents,'' said Yuli
Edelstein, a colleague of Sharansky's who immigrated from Moscow two
years ago.

<TEXT>
   In a new offensive against drug
traffickers, Colombia's narcotics police destroyed eight cocaine
laboratories, 2,310 pounds of cocaine and 44 runways in remote
areas, the national police chief said.
   The raids, all in jungle areas, occurred last weekend as part of
Operation Springtime, Gen. Miguel Antonio Gomez said in a news
release on Monday.
   Gomez took over the national police last month in one of the
frequent changes of command in government security forces. New
police commanders frequently come on strong with a series of raids.
   Eight people, who had all made just a few dollars a day as
laborers at the cocaine processing labs, were arrested in the
weekend raids, Gomez said.
   Not one of Colombia's dozen major cocaine bosses has ever been
arrested on drug trafficking charges and convicted in Colombia.
   An average of two dozen cocaine processing labs are destroyed in
Colombia each year, and scores of clandestine runways are bombed by
the air force.
   New labs and new runways appear within weeks. A police colonel
told The Associated Press last year that there probably were more
than 500 clandestine runways in use by drug traffickers in Colombia
at any given time.
   The U.S. government gives about $15 million worth of aid to
Colombia each year in the form of equipment and training to fight
drug trafficking.
   Colombian narcotics officials have suggested privately that $15
million dollars does not go far toward stopping the
multibillion-dollar illegal cocaine trafficking in Colombia.
   Scores of helicopters and thousands of police would be needed to
deal effectively with the problem, the officials have said privately.

   Gentle country crooner Randy Travis and
stylish crossover singer George Michael dominated the American Music
Awards, where heavy metal rowdiness and rap jive earned only limited
acceptance.
   The Shrine Auditorium nationally televised ceremonies Monday
night ushered in first-time categories for heavy metal and rap,
which enjoy widespread youth culture popularity.
   Michael and Travis each won three trophies and diversity reigned
in the winners list with artists like Whitney Houston, Def Leppard,
D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince, Gladys Knight and Guns N' Roses.
   Def Leppard, who didn't attend the ceremony despite three
nominations, won two trophies for heavy metal music but lost with
Van Halen to Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine in the pop-rock
group category. Guns N' Roses lost to Def Leppard twice in heavy
metal but won for pop-rock single.
   The lethargic performance by the tattooed, long-haired ruffians
Guns N' Roses, who were joined by ex-Eagle Don Henley, contrasted
sharply with the show's other flashy, professional numbers.
   Their bad-boy persona also didn't endear them to show producer
Dick Clark, who was forced to move Rod Stewart's performance ahead
of schedule because Guns N' Roses showed up late.
   Travis was named favorite male country vocalist and won the album
trophy for ``Always &amp; Forever'' and the single award for ``I Told
You So.'' He won in three categories last year for the same album.
   Asked about milking awards twice from the same album, he said
backstage, ``I'm not sure how that happened but I'm glad it did.''
   Unlike Grammy Awards decided by artists and industry insiders,
20,000 ordinary music lovers are the arbiters for American Music
Awards. Because ``Always &amp; Forever'' spanned two calendar years, it
was eligible twice.
   It happened before. Glen Campbell's ``Rhinestone Cowboy'' won in
1976-77, Kenny Rogers' ``The Gambler'' in 1980-81 and the
Rogers-Dolly Parton duet ``Islands in the Stream'' got a two-year
ride in 1984-85.
   Michael, formerly of the group Wham!, was favorite male vocalist
in the pop-rock and the soul-rhythm-and-blues categories. His album
``Faith'' claimed the soul-R&amp;B album award.
   ``A couple of years back when I split the group with Andrew
(Ridgely), I knew I had a tough job ahead of me and I thought that
maybe people weren't going to give me much of a chance,'' Michael
told the audience.
   Miss Houston won the female pop-rock and rhythm-and-blues
vocalist categories, her 10th and 11th American Music Awards, and
Miss Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine's Latin beat got them the
pop-rock group award.
   ``I never expected to win this,'' said Miss Estefan. ``It's
wonderful to be able to cross over to a whole new market and to have
everyone from all walks of life like our music.''
   Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips, who dominated the awards in 1976 with
four trophies, beat out hot new acts New Edition and Salt-N-Pepa for
R&amp;B group honors. Alabama won its seventh consecutive country group
trophy.
   Def Leppard swept the heavy metal category as favorite artist and
for the album ``Hysteria.'' The new rap category went to favorite
artist Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince and his album ``He's The D.J.,
I'm The Rapper.''
   Tracy Chapman, who led Grammy nominations earlier this month with
six, was the favorite new pop-rock artist but did not appear to
claim the trophy.
   The ``Dirty Dancing'' movie soundtrack won favorite pop-rock
album.
   Highlighting the three-hour ABC-TV presentation were tributes to
Michael Jackson and Willie Nelson, who were given non-competitive
trophies for personal achievement. A brief segment also honored
three artists who died last year _ Roy Orbison, Brook Benton and
Andy Gibb.
   ``I would first like to thank God, who makes all things
possible,'' said Jackson.
   Guns N' Roses won best pop-rock single for ``Sweet Child O'
Mine'' and Freddie Jackson's ``Nice 'N' Slow'' took the R&amp;B single
award. The favorite new R&amp;B artist was Al B. Sure!, a Boston native.
   Reba McEntire won favorite female country singer, and Patty
Loveless was favorite new country artist.
   Names of nominees were compiled from year-end sales charts of the
music industry trade publication Cash Box.
   Winners were selected by a polling of 20,000 people who receive
ballots sent by Herbert Altman Communications Research Inc. The
ballots are counted by the Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co.
accounting firm.
   The Grammy Awards will be handed out Feb. 22.

   Jeremiah Cole, a 46-year-old former health
maintenance organization senior manager, was the foreman of the jury
that convicted Joel Steinberg of first-degree manslaughter following
a 12-week trial. These are his comments as told to Associated Press
writer Samuel Maull, who covered the three-month trial.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>By JEREMIAH COLE</NOTE>
<NOTE>For The Associated Press</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   We arrived at a verdict in the Joel Steinberg
murder trial in our eighth day of deliberations because for a short
period on Monday I abdicated my position as chairman of the group.
   That action enabled the last holdout (against a guilty verdict
for first-degree manslaughter) to participate more fully in the
deliberations. That person and I had had some friction, some
conflict and another person's assumption of the chair enabled the
holdout to participate without dealing with me.
   The timing for this action was right. It could not have been done
any sooner.
   I knew before the testimony was half over that there was enormous
potential for a hung jury. I could sense it in the people.
   I thought there would be a hung jury. This was because of the
complexity of the case and the circumstantial nature of the evidence.
   It was clear from the beginning that the only possibility of
arriving at a verdict was to keep everyone talking, avoid for a time
the areas of greatest conflict, and try to find things we could
agree on.
   We did not take a vote right away when we began deliberations. An
immediate vote would have made the jurors feel locked into a
position. I felt that we should start with as many facts that seemed
to have significance that we could agree on.
   There were unmistakable indications at the beginning of our
deliberations that we were almost hopelessly divided.
   There were three who indicated that it was more probable that
Hedda (Nussbaum, Steinberg's live-in lover) had done it (fatally
injured Lisa) than that Joel had done it.
   But they were not putting forth their case. They never made any
effort to convince anyone of their point of view. They thought it
was enough that they had this point of view. Essentially, their
position was, ``I don't think Joel did it and that's it.'' They
didn't understand how a jury works and comes to a consensus.
   There were two other groups who were generally willing to argue
their positions. There were four in the Joel-is-guilty group. And
about five were in what basically is a middle group that was
undecided. They always felt they should try to convince the other
people of the positions they were holding.
   The defense strategy changed several times during the trial and
that internal inconsistency weakened their case.
   Only two people could have killed Lisa. If Joel knows Hedda did
it, then what's all this stuff about Reye's syndrome (which the
defense at one point contended was the cause of death). I could have
easily entertained a defense of insanity. And there was another
juror who was in the Joel-is-guilty camp who said she would have
been open to an insanity defense. He left the child on the bathroom
floor when he went out to dinner. Then he comes home and uses
cocaine. There was some casual speculation by us about why they
didn't put on an insanity defense.
   The people who believed Hedda had done it used Marilyn Walton's
testimony (who said she saw Ms. Nussbaum slap Lisa) in their own
arguments. They were taking it into account in support of their case.
   Eventually, we voted unanimously a ``not guilty'' verdict on the
murder count. This was a very difficult vote for several jurors who
may have done so in order to avoid a hung jury.
   There were hundreds of times when tension was relieved by joking.
There were only about four times when people almost came to blows.
   I think that if I look deeply into my heart, I would say there
were people (jurors) I did not trust and some I did not hold in
great respect. Over time, I came to change my opinion about some of
the people.
   In the final analysis, everything we accomplished was as a result
of the two things we had in common, a sense of humor and a great
willingness to work together. One of the court officers said that we
were the loudest and funniest jury he had ever observed. The noise,
the running jokes, and the laughter were our way of letting off
steam during and after our many long tense emotional deliberations.
   There was an enormous amount of affection in that jury room _ I
would say a form of love.
   This jury was an extraordinarily diverse group of people. I think
it's fair to say that despite all of our differences of background
and of opinion, we became a family _ so much so that we are planning
a reunion in March.

   Joel Steinberg, who faced four homicide counts in
the death of his 6-year-old illegally adopted daughter, Lisa, was
acquitted of the most serious charge and convicted of the
second-most serious.
   Steinberg was charged with second-degree murder, which would have
required a finding by the state Supreme Court jury that he had
recklessly struck the girl and then showed depraved indifference to
her life by failing to get medical help.
   The jury acquitted him of that charge, which carries a sentence
of 25 years to life in prison.
   The charge on which Steinberg was convicted _ first-degree
manslaughter _ required the jury to find that he intended to cause
serious physical harm to the girl, and that the injury caused her
death. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 8 1@3 to 25 years in
prison.
   The judge had instructed the jury it could infer that Steinberg
intended to cause the injury ``by the results produced by his act.''
But if they found his use of cocaine had so dulled his awareness
that he could not form intent, they were to find him innocent of
first-degree manslaughter.
   The jury did not need to consider the two lesser charges:
second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.
   The former requires action that is reckless but not with depraved
indifference. It carries a five-to-15-year prison sentence.
   The latter covers situations in which a death is caused by
someone who fails to perceive the risk of his actions. It carries a
term of 1 1@3 to four years.

   Shouting ``Yankee go home,'' dozens of
radical students hurled firebombs today at the U.S. cultural center
in Kwangju, U.S. officials said. It was the second such attack this
month.
   About 30 firebombs were thrown, but none landed inside the
compound, said an official at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. The
official, who requesting anonymity, said there were no injuries or
damage.
   About 50 students shouted anti-U.S. slogans as they dashed out of
alleys and hurled dozens of firebombs and rocks toward the center,
the Yonhap news agency reported. Most of the bombs landed on the
street, it said.
   ``Drive out Yankees who manipulated the Kwangju massacre,''
Yonhap quoted students as shouting.
   They also chanted ``Shut down the Kwangju center'' and ``Punish
(former President) Chun Doo-hwan and (President) Roh Tae-woo,'' the
agency said.
   Roh was elected in December 1987 and replaced Chun, who stepped
down after seven years of authoritarian rule and played a leading
role in the brutal military suppression of the 1980 Kwangju uprising.
   About 100 riot police guarding the center charged at the
attackers, firing tear gas, and chased them away in a few minutes,
Yonhap said. The agency did not say whether any students were
arrested.
   On Jan. 18, about 50 students attacked the center with
sledgehammers, rocks and firebombs and broke windows. No one was
hurt.
   U.S. officials in Seoul, who say the center has been attacked
eight times in the past last year by radical students, today denied
reports that they have decided to close it.
   But they said the facility could close if the attacks continue.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington that
the United States has been seeking promises from South Korean
authorities that they will provide adequate protection for the
Kwangju center and its staff.
   U.S. cultural centers in Seoul and Pusan have also been attacked,
but not as frequently as the Kwangju center. The centers have
libraries and occassionaly offer speaker programs.
   Anti-U.S. sentiment is relatively high in Kwangju, an opposition
stronghold 180 miles southwest of Seoul, because of the suppression
of the 1980 pro-democracy civil uprising in the southern city.
   By official count, about 200 people were killed and more than
1,000 injured or wounded as government troops put down the nine-day
armed revolt.
   Many opposition and dissident figures claim the United States was
involved in the Kwangju incident by supporting a South Korean
government plan to quell the uprising ruthlessly.
   The United States has denied any involvement in the incident and
agreed to submit written testimony from U.S. officials to South
Korean lawmakers who are conducting parliamentary investigations
into misdeeds committed under Chun.
   The United States has 42,000 troops stationed in South Korea
under a mutual defense treaty and many radical students want the
U.S. soldiers to leave.

<HEAD>Gorbachev to Visit West Germany, Cuba, Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
will visit West Germany for the first time in June and plans
wide-ranging economic and political talks with the Bonn leadership,
a government spokesman said.
   Gorbachev also will visit Britain and Cuba in April, the British
government and Soviet media said Monday. Gorbachev had planned
visits to those two nations in December but canceled them because of
the earthquake in Armenia.
   In Bonn, chief government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said in a
statement Monday that Gorbachev would visit from June 12-15, meeting
several times with Chancellor Helmut Kohl as well as other
high-ranking officials.
   Ost said that after the talks, both countries would issue a joint
communique about ``the future of cooperation'' between West Germany
and the Soviet Union. He did not elaborate.
   When Kohl visited Moscow in October, several economic and
cultural agreements were signed.Similar agreements are expected
during the Gorbachev visit, Ost said.
   West Germany is the Soviet Union's largest Western trading
partner and West German banks have been heavily involved in issuing
new credits to help modernize the communist nation's beleaguered
consumer services industry.
   In London, a spokesman for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
office said Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, would visit Britain from
April 5-7.
   The Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda reported Monday that
Gorbachev will go to Cuba in early April, but did not give specific
dates.

   The dollar was mostly lower in calm early European
trading today. Gold prices rose.
   Currency dealers in Frankfurt, West Germany, said the dollar is
in a retrenchment phase after failing to pass key psychological
resistance barriers of 1.870 marks and 130 yen on Monday.
   ``The market was ripe for a downward correction because too many
people were bullish,'' said one dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt.
   Dealers said they expected the dollar to trade within a narrow
range ahead of the Group of Seven industrialized nations meeting in
Washington on Thursday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.60 yen to a closing 129.13. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 129.40 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.8634 West German marks, down from 1.8660
   _1.5845 Swiss francs, down from 1.5884
   _6.3365 French francs, down from 6.3500
   _2.1019 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1085
   _1,362.50 Italian lire, down from 1,365.50
   _1.1815 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1820
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7620, slightly cheaper for
buyers than $1.7650 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $394.65 a troy ounce, up
from $394.50 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $394.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $394.90, up from $394.00 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 59 cents to close at a bid
$396.55.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.84 a troy ounce,
little changed from Monday's $5.83, but its lowest level since March
1987.

<HEAD>Hurricane-Force Winds Blast Through Montana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane-force winds that toppled railroad cars howled through
Montana today as the cold air that caused Alaska's historic cold
snap headed for the lower 48 states after high-temperature records
were set or tied in 16 places.
   The winds, accompanied by snow in some places, gusted more than
100 mph along the east slopes of the Montana Rockies, overturning a
freight train and blowing over grain elevators. No injuries were
reported. Choteau reported a gust of 124 mph. The winds were
expected to spread to Wyoming and Colorado today.
   Moving behind the cold front generating the wind and snow was the
massive dome of cold air that caused the two-week Alaskan cold
spell. Temperatures were expected to drop well below zero by
Wednesday in Montana and North Dakota.
   The high-pressure zone over Alaska set a North American record
Monday for the highest pressure ever recorded: 31.58 inches at
Bettles and Big Delta, Alaska. The old record of 31.53 inches was
set Jan. 1, 1974, over the Yukon Territory, Canada.
   Elsewhere today, rain fell along the northern Pacific Coast and
snow fell on the Cascade mountains of Washington state.
   In Marquette, Mich., the temperature hit 37 degrees early today,
breaking the high-temperature record for the date of 36 degrees set
in 1964. It was the fifth day in a row records were broken or tied
in that city.
   High-temperature records were set Monday in 13 Western and
Midwestern cities, including Rapid City, S.D., where the balmy
72-degree reading surpassed by 3 degrees the mark for the date set
in 1892. It was 67 degrees in Scottsbluff, Neb., breaking the
66-degree record set in 1911 and 62 degrees in Great Falls, Mont.,
breaking the 1962 record of 61. Records were tied in three other
places.
   Today's forecast called for rain in the Pacific Northwest, with
snow in the mountains; snow from the northern Rockies to North
Dakota, northern Minnesota and upper Michigan; scattered rain
showers in the lower Great Lakes and northern New England, with snow
in northern Maine; and continuing strong, gusty winds in the
northern and central Rockies.
   High temperatures were forecast in the teens and 20s from
northern Montana to northern Minnesota; the 30s and 40s from the
Pacific Northwest to the northern and central Rockies, much of the
northern Plains, much of the upper Mississippi Valley, the upper
Great Lakes, New York state and New England; the 70s in Southern
California, southern Arizona, the southern Plains, southern and
western Kansas, the lower Mississippi Valley, the Gulf Coast and
much of Florida; and in the 50s and 60s in much of the rest of the
nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 2
degrees at Havre, Mont., to 70 at the Key West, Fla., Naval Air
Station.

   Barbara Nelson had been afraid to go out
at night because of sniper attacks near her home. Then she learned
that her tenant had confessed to the crimes.
   ``And here he is living in my house,'' Mrs. Nelson exclaimed
Monday after authorities said self-styled commando Yusef Abdullah
Rahman had confessed to one killing and sniper attacks that wounded
three people on eastern Long Island.
   ``I've been sitting here all morning shaking my head back and
forth,'' Mrs. Nelson said. ``I can't believe it.''
   Rahman also has admitted to three killings in Kansas City, Mo.,
authorities said.
   ``There is some indication that he wanted to kill all the drug
dealers in Kansas City,'' Kansas City police Sgt. Pete Edlund said.
   Suffolk County police reported getting telephone calls following
the Long Island attacks in which the caller said his victims were
``drug dealers and crooked cops,'' but police said there was no
evidence that the shootings were drug related.
   Police arrested Rahman on Saturday, six days after weapons found
in a car in Southampton were linked to him and the sniper attacks.
   Police said Rahman told them that he began to play army combat
games when he was 6 years old, bought his first real gun when he was
14 and killed someone four years later.
   ``It appears that he enjoyed killing,'' said Timothy Mazzei,
deputy chief of the district attorney's homicide bureau. ``He got
his kicks out of playing army and shooting people.''
   In written and videotaped confessions after his arrest, Rahman
said he frequently went into the woods to practice combat training
maneuvers.
   On Dec. 5, the day of the first Long Island shooting, Rahman said
he was ``running and crawling'' in the woods when he encountered a
dog, which he shot. He said he then saw the dog's owner, Bernard
Timothy Heaney.
   ``I opened up on him,'' Rahman said in the police confession.
   Police said Heaney was shot to death with a .22-caliber rifle.
   In three other attacks in which people were wounded, Rahman
apparently chose his victims at random, firing into their home
windows before riding away on his bicycle.
   In his final attack, Rahman shot the emergency lights out of a
police patrol car but no one was injured.
   Friends in the lower income neighborhood in Riverhead where
Rahman has rented a room since August described him as an extremely
quiet, devout Muslim.
   ``They seem to be talking about a different person than who lived
here,'' Mrs. Nelson said of police. ``He was very mannerly and
respectful.''
   Mazzei said Rahman told police he knew his actions were wrong and
expressed remorse for his actions.
   ``There is no question there is a sickness involved but we don't
believe he was legally insane,'' he said.
   The case is to be presented to a grand jury later this week.
   Rahman was placed on a suicide watch at the Suffolk County jail,
where he is being held without bail, Warden Salvatore Romano said.

<HEAD>Swaggart Calls Penthouse Story `Diabolical'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart has
accused Penthouse magazine of trying to destroy his ministry through
a ``diabolical and slanderous'' story in which a stripper says she
performed sexual acts for him.
   The stripper's employer labeled the woman's allegations, detailed
in the magazine's current issue, ``a pornographic fairy tale.'' As
Swaggart threatened to file a libel suit Monday, the magazine said
it was standing by its article.
   The allegations by the woman, Catherine Mary Kampen, are similar
to those levied last year by a prostitute, Debra Murphree. Those
allegations led to Swaggart's ouster from the Assemblies of God, a
Pentecostal denomination, and a major downturn in the fortunes of
Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries.
   ``There is not one shred of truth to these allegations. I have
never met or seen the woman,'' Swaggart said at a news conference at
his ministry headquarters.
   ``Our attorneys learned of this fraudulent story in December and
had clearly shown Penthouse and its porno writer, Art Harris (the
author), that the story was untrue,'' Swaggart said. ``We now know
that they already knew and did not care that it was a lie.''
   Penthouse spokesman Sy Presten issued a statement for publisher
Bob Guccione saying the magazine stood behind the story.
   ``The fact that she was with Swaggart has been corroborated by
her husband and others in Louisiana,'' the statement said. ``The
things she reports Swaggart made her do are very similar to the
story of Debra Murphree ... which have never been contradicted.''
   Kampen, 38, was quoted in Penthouse as saying Swaggart gained her
trust with his counseling, then emotionally manipulated her into
acting out sexual fantasies.
   She was reported to be in New York for promotional appearances
about the article and could not be reached for additional comment.
   Rhonda Shear, co-owner of ``Hot Lines,'' a strip-tease telegram
service that employs Kampen in New Orleans, said her sister, Nona,
told her that Kampen made up the story after seeing the Penthouse
account of Murphree's relations with Swaggart.
   ``She told my sister it was all concocted,'' Shear said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles. ``She saw the issue with Debra
Murphree (and said) ... `It's only a matter of time before someone
jumps on that band wagon. Why not me?' ... She said it was foolproof
if she said it happened at her house.''
   Shear's sister, contacted in New Orleans, said a lawyer had
advised her not to comment. She refused to confirm her sister's
story.
   At the news conference, Swaggart accused Penthouse of conspiring
to destroy his ministry and asked for public support.
   ``I am appealing to the American people, and especially the
Christians, to help us by letting the pornographers know they have
filled this land with their filth far too long. There seems to be no
end to their diabolical slander.''
   Attorney Dennis Brewer, a member of the ministries' board of
directors, said Monday that a lawsuit would be filed within the next
few days in Texas, where punitive damages are permitted in libel
actions.
   Last February, Swaggart confessed to an undisclosed sin, and
Murphree said she had been paid by the evangelist to perform sex
acts while he watched. Swaggart later was defrocked by the
Assemblies of God after refusing to step down from the pulpit for at
least a year.
   The furor resulted in the cancellation of Swaggart's programs
from three major cable television networks, an exodus of students
and faculty from his Bible college and layoffs from the ministry, a
major Baton Rouge employer.

   A Greenpeace ship collided with a
Japanese whaling vessel today off Antarctica in the most serious
incident since the environmental group began a campaign a week ago
to stop the whale hunt.
   The Japanese ship, Nisshin Maru No. 3, sustained minor damage to
its hand rails while the Greenpeace ship Gondwana was not damaged,
said Greenpeace spokesman Peter Wilkinson. There were no injuries,
he said.
   Wilkinson, speaking from the Gondwana by radio telephone, told
The Associated Press the 1,435-ton Greenpeace ship was in a
``perfectly legitimate position'' when the vessels collided.
   In Sydney, Greenpeace's coordinator for Antarctica Lyn
Goldsworthy said: ``The Japanese ship used an iron grappling hook
and attached it to the Gondwana to pull it out of the way. In the
maneuvering that resulted the Japanese boat collided with Gondwana.''
   Immediately after the collision, Wilkinson said, there was a
flood of communications between the skippers of both ships. ``The
Japanese told us to stay away and keep a distance of at least 300
yards,'' he said.
   Japan has said it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of
its scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks _
despite a moratorium imposed by the International Whaling Commission.
   Greenpeace contends most of the whale meat will end up in sushi
restaurants in Japan.
   In Tokyo, a whaling official said today that attempts by the
environmental group to block Japanese ships from whaling in the
Antarctic are endangering the lives of the crewmen and amount to
terrorism.
   ``This is terrorism, the same as that opposed by the United
States and other countries,'' said Takehiro Takayama of the
Tokyo-based Japan Whaling Association. ``They have no concern about
human life.''
   Wilkinson said that after the collision, the Gondwana, carrying a
crew of 19, launched inflatable dinghies into the icy waters in an
effort to prevent the loading of harpooned whales onto the factory
ship.
   ``They then turned water hoses on us,'' he said. Wilkinson, a
veteran of Antarctic expeditions, said the Greenpeace vessel later
chased several Japanese catcher ships whose crews were hunting for
whales with explosive harpoons.
   He estimated that Japanese harpooners already have taken between
50 and 55 Minke whales this season, about 10 of them since the
Gondwana caught up with the whaling fleet a week ago.
   Wilkinson said Greenpeace would continue harassing the Japanese
whaling fleet for several more days. ``The whales don't belong to
the Japanese,'' he said. ``They belong to all of us.''

<TEXT>
   The wife and daughter of kidnapped U.S.
Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins sent him birthday greetings in a
message published today by the Beirut newspaper An-Nahar.
   Higgins, who was abducted Feb. 17, 1988, marked his 44th birthday
Jan. 15.
   ``Mrs. Robin Higgins and her daughter, Chrissy, apparently hoped
that the letter would be published on Jan. 15 to coincide with Mr.
Higgins' birthday. But the letter, mailed ... on Jan. 3, was
received by An-Nahar yesterday (Monday),'' the newspaper said in
Arabic.
   An-Nahar published the text in English, apparently hoping
Higgins' captors would allow him to read it.
   The letter said: ``Dear William Richard Higgins, my husband:
   ``I send you warm birthday greetings. We miss you very much
today, as always, but send you special love this day.
   ``We hope and pray that 1989 brings us happier days, and that we
can celebrate all the important days we've missed _ our anniversary,
our birthdays, Christmas _ together, soon.
   ``Your love has kept me warm and strong, my birthday wish for you
is that my love can do the same for you until we are together
again.''
   The letter was signed: ``Love always, Robin and Chrissy.''
   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., headed a 76-man team of U.N. observers
stationed along the border with Israel when he was kidnapped near
the southern city of Tyre.
   His captors, the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth, said Dec. 12 that the Vietnam veteran had been
``sentenced'' to death for spying for Israel. The United States and
the United Nations have denied the charge.
   The same group claimed it has abducted 12 Lebanese Jews since
1984, and has said it killed eight of the Jewish captives. The
bodies of four of the Jews were found in Beirut.
   Higgins is among 15 foreign captives missing in Lebanon since
1985. Terry Anderson, 41, the chief Middle East correspondent for
the Associated Press, is the longest-held of the hostages. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   Four men have been convicted and jailed for
stealing at least $53 million in cash, gold, silver, gems and other
valuables in Britain's biggest robbery. Police say about two-thirds
of the haul is missing.
   Valerio Viccei, the 34-year-old Italian who masterminded the
robbery at a London safe deposit center, was sentenced to 22 years
in jail on Monday after the two-month jury trial at London's Old
Bailey Central Criminal Court.
   Detectives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they thought
Viccei, who had most of a month to dispose of the haul before he was
arrested, still controls much of it.
   One Scotland Yard detective said: ``He is set for a very
comfortable retirement when he gets out'' of prison.
   Assisted by Parvez Latiff, the 32-year-old debt-ridden owner of
the safe deposit center, the gang broke into 120 deposit boxes on
July 12, 1987 and stole enough valuables to fill a bathtub at their
hideout, prosecutor Roy Amlot told the jury.
   Viccei and an accomplice had posed as customers at the safe
deposit center across from Harrods department store in the expensive
Knightsbridge area.
   Once inside, they pulled guns on security guards and on Latiff,
who concealed his involvement. The gang members then spent two hours
breaking open boxes, taking goods such as a 40-carat diamond, since
recovered, belonging to the wife of West German industrialist Gerd
Rudolph Flick.
   One robber cried, ``Bingo,'' when he opened a box containing
$265,000 worth of cocaine, the court heard.
   But Viccei cut his finger on one box, took off his glove, and
left a fingerprint, which allowed police to arrest him a week before
he planned to flee to South America.
   Viccei estimated the haul was worth $70 million and detectives
said it was worth at least $53 million.
   Latiff, who had been promised one-third of the haul, was
sentenced to 18 years in prison for robbery and five years
concurrently for possessing a gun.
   One accomplice, David Poole, was given 16 years with a five-year
concurrent sentence. Another, Peter O'Donohue, was sentenced today
to 11 years in jail. ``Some you win, some you lose,'' O'Donohue said
as he was led from the court.
   Viccei also received a concurrent 12-year term for a firearms
offense.
   Police said about $17 million worth of the haul has been
recovered. They said about $12 million worth of this will be
returned to owners but that about $5 million worth remains unclaimed.
   Police think many of the mainly foreign owners may not have
claimed items of stolen property because they want to conceal the
full extent of their wealth for political, tax or other reasons.
   Once any appeals or subsequent trials have been dealt with, the
unclaimed goods will be auctioned off for charity, police said.
   Insurance companies have contacted detectives to authenticate
claims and losers cannot claim for more than they admitted to
police. One detective said: ``We think a lot of people have lost
property they never told anyone about.''
   Britain's previous biggest robbery was the theft of gold,

<HEAD>Takeshita Departs for Summit With Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita left Japan for the
United States today for talks with President Bush on U.S.-Japanese
cooperation in international affairs as well as trade and defense
issues.
   Takeshita's small delegation includes his wife, Naoko, and
Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno. They are to stay one day in New York
before traveling to Washington for the summit Wednesday.
   Senior Foreign Ministry officials said they expect the meeting _
Bush's first session with a foreign head of government since he took
office Jan. 20 _ will allow the two leaders to discuss issues of
global importance and get to know each other better.
   Takeshita, 64, wants to discuss with Bush ``how we can best
coordinate important issues with the United States, mainly on the
international situation. ... We do not intend to raise specific
issues,'' said Yukio Okamoto, director of the Foreign Ministry's
First North American Division.
   Recent criticism of Japan's large trade surplus and defense
spending by Bush appointees, including Trade
Representative-designate Carla Hills and Secretary of
Defense-designate John Tower, suggests the Americans may want to
discuss specific issues.
   While in Washington, Takeshita is to present to former U.S.
Ambassador Mike Mansfield his government's prestigious First Class
Order of the Rising Sun award. Mansfield, 85, retired last year
after being ambassador to Japan for 11 years. Foreign Ministry
officials said the medal has been awarded to only two other
foreigners: Gen. Douglas MacArthur and former West German Chancellor
Konrad Adenauer.
   Takeshita is to visit Los Angeles and meet briefly with former
President Ronald Reagan before returning to Tokyo on Feb. 7.

   Israeli soldiers fought with youths who threw
stones and hoisted outlawed Palestinian flags today during another
general strike in the occupied territories, and 17 Arabs were
reported shot and wounded.
   Also today, a fundamentalist Moslem leader in the occupied Gaza
Strip said he would back elections in the territories under
international supervision and would be willing to meet with Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin. The minister has proposed a peace plan that
includes such elections.
   Today's general strike, which shut businesses and halted
transport, was called by the Palestinian uprising leaders, who are
backed by the Palestine Liberation Organization. On Monday, PLO
activists persuaded Palestinians to ignore calls for a work stoppage
ordered by a rival Moslem extremist group, Hamas.
   Arab doctors said 17 Palestinians were shot and wounded in
clashes throughout the territories. The army said it was checking
reported casualties.
   The worst clash was in the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp,
where residents hung 10 outlawed Palestinian flags from utility
poles, Arab reports said. Nine Palestinian youths, including a
13-year-old, were shot and wounded, Arab doctors said.
   A 75-year-old woman was shot in the face during a clash with
soldiers in a village near the West Bank town of Jenin, said doctors
at Al-Ittihad Hospital in Nablus.
   Seven other Palestinians were wounded in clashes in Gaza City and
the Nusseirat refugee camp, as well as the West Bank's Balata and
Jenin refugee camps, Arab doctors said. The wounded included a
16-year-old boy shot in the head, they said.
   The 13-month revolt, which has spawned repeated protests and
general strikes, has claimed the lives of 370 Palestinians and 15
Israelis. The Palestinians are protesting occupation by Israel,
which seized the lands from neighboring Arab states in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the fundamentalist
Hamas movement, said he supported an Israeli proposal to hold
elections in the occupied lands, but he said the vote must be under
international supervision.
   ``There is no escape from a dialogue,'' Yassin said on Israel
television's Arabic-language program.
   Yassin said he would be ready to meet with Rabin if an invitation
were extended, said television reporter Yoni Ben-Menachem, who
interviewed him.

   Another senior military officer told
Communist Party leaders today Yugoslavia's economic and political
crisis is threatening to break apart the nation and that the army
might intervene.
   Vice Adm. Stane Brovet told the session of the policy-making
Central Committee that in some parts of Yugoslavia ``the situation
is escaping control ... (and the country's) territorial integrity
and constitutional order are being jeopardized.''
   Protesters in a wave of mass demonstrations in past months have
demanded sweeping changes in party leadership.
   ``Forces that wish the destruction of Yugoslavia through
non-institutional (illegal) methods are appearing on the scene,''
Brovet said.
   ``Yugoslavia can survive only as a true federation ... and the
forces which are working toward the breakup of such a Yugoslavia
should be prevented primarily by political but also by all other
means,'' he said without elaborating.
   His comments followed a similar warning Monday.
   ``What some describe as the battle for Yugoslavia will not be
waged without the Yugoslav army,'' declared Adm. Petar Simic, a
member of the ruling Politburo and the military's chief political
officer.
   Simic called for party unity at the plenary session of the
Central Committee.
   Liberal and hard-liner committee members have been clashing over
how to cope with 250 percent inflation, a sharp drop in living
standards and an alarming increase in labor and ethnic unrest.
   The army generally has remained on the sidelines in the struggle
to end the country's woes that pits advocates of greater democracy
against supporters of a more centralized communist system.
   But senior officers are now showing signs of increasing unease,
and Simic indicated the military _ with an estimated combined
strength of about 200,000 _ might take a more active role ``in
putting a stop to confrontations between the republics.''
   ``The crisis in Yugoslavia is rapidly approaching its
culmination,'' Simic said, adding that the party is ``losing battle
after battle'' as the ``political system is breaking apart.'' The
army is ``stable and prepared to fulfill its role and purpose,'' he
said.
   The Central Committee session was convened to discuss calls for
the resignation of the Communist Party leader, Stipe Suvar, a
liberal-minded Croat who favors greater decentralization of the
economy.
   It was expected to be the scene of a showdown between liberals
and the hardline coalition led by Slobodan Milosevic, the ambitious
party chief of Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six loosely
federated republics.
   Suvar told committee members Monday that Yugoslavia must now
choose between more democracy and ``neo-Stalinism.''
   He also lashed out at Milosevic, his chief political rival, not
mentioning the Serbian party boss by name but attacking the politics
of centralized control favored by Milosevic.
   Milosevic on Monday called for sweeping personnel changes in the
country's leadership, which he blamed for the current crisis.
   ``It would be honest and intelligent that those who have clashed
with the people should allow themselves to be replaced by better and
more capable men,'' he said.
   Milosevic, who has called for more centralized party control over
the country's affairs, draws his support from Yugoslavia's poorer
southern regions. In those areas, people fear that market-oriented
economic reforms could lead to massive layoffs if they cause
unprofitable enterprises to forfeit state subsidies.
   Suvar is supported by Yugoslavia's most liberal and Westernized
republic, Slovenia, and his native Croatia, which favor more
democracy and radical market-oriented reforms as a solution to the
country's protracted crisis.
   Milan Kucan, Slovenia's party chief, warned Monday that
``Yugoslavia is practically falling apart.''
   The country of 23 million people, its living standard in steep
decline since 1980, experienced thousands of strikes last year and
unemployment reached 15 percent.
   Since the death in 1980 of Josip Broz Tito, the strong-willed
founder of communist Yugoslavia, an eight-man rotating presidency
has headed the country under the guidance of the Communist Party.
The system balances the country's competing ethnic groups.

   Afrikaner political leaders
hope to raise $420,000 to build a monument honoring former Prime
Minister Hendrik Verwoerd, one of the principal architects of
apartheid.
   State-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said a site has been
set aside for the monument in downtown Pretoria, the administrative
capital. The money would be raised through a nationwide campaign.
   It quoted Willem Cruywagen, chairman of the monument committee,
as saying Verwoerd deserved to be honored because he oversaw South
Africa's establishment as a republic when it left the British
Commonwealth in 1961.
   Verwoerd's policies showed enmity toward the Africans, the
British and Jews. He laid the groundwork for the government's racial
separation policies after becoming minister of native affairs in
1950. He became prime minister in 1958 and held the office until his
assassination in 1966.
   One of his chief creations was the homeland system. He envisioned
a future South Africa in which only whites would be citizens, while
blacks would have voting rights only in nominally autonomous tribal
homelands.

   Joel Steinberg was convicted of beating to death
his illegally adopted daughter, but jurors rejected a murder charge
because his live-in companion ``could have saved Lisa's life''
during nearly 12 hours she lay comatose on a bathroom floor.
   Eight days of heated deliberations ended Monday when the jury
reached the manslaughter verdict in the case that focused national
attention on domestic violence and the question of who should report
cases of suspected child abuse.
   By acquitting Steinberg of second-degree murder, the jurors
decided that the disbarred lawyer had not shown ``depraved
indifference to human life'' when he struck 6-year-old Lisa in a
rage in November 1987.
   ``It's a sad day for the kids who are being abused in this
country,'' said Dr. Vincent Fontana, chairman of the Mayor's Task
Force on Child Abuse, who believed Steinberg was guilty of murder.
   ``The child protective system failed (Lisa), the school system
failed her, and now the judicial system has failed her.''
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau promised to seek the maximum
8 1@3-to-25-year prison sentence for the first-degree manslaughter
conviction, which required the jury to find that he intended to
cause Lisa serious harm. Steinberg, 47, faces sentencing March 8.
   ``Steinberg has shown himself to fully deserve that sentence,''
Morgenthau said, adding: The case ``highlighted the dreadful
problems that beset our city _ child abuse, drug abuse and family
violence. All of us have a responsibility to work to ensure that
similar tragedies do not reoccur.''
   Steinberg was stoic as the verdict was announced, ending a
three-month trial in a case that spun a web of drugs and domestic
violence from behind the facade of a quiet Greenwich Village
building.
   ``He did not say anything,'' said Steinberg's attorney, Ira
London. ``He did not do anything.
   ``We do not consider this (verdict) a win for Joel or a triumph
for Joel,'' said London.
   London said an appeal is planned based in part on the showing of
a graphic videotape of injuries suffered by Steinberg's former
companion, Hedda Nussbaum. He has called the tape prejudiced and
inflammatory.
   Michele Launders, Lisa's 27-year-old biological mother, fled the
courtroom in tears and would not speak to reporters after the
verdict.
   Just before the announcement, she said, ``The only verdict that
would be justice for Lisa is murder.''
   She had been sitting next to Graceann Smigiel, the grandmother of
a then-16-month-old boy who was found in Steinberg's apartment,
tethered to a crib and drinking spoiled milk, when police and
paramedics removed Lisa's comastose body on the morning of Nov. 2,
1987.
   Steinberg and Ms. Nussbaum were charged with Lisa's death but Ms.
Nussbaum testified under immunity as the star prosecution witness.
   Publicity about the case reached a peak during Ms. Nussbaum's
emotionally wrenching testimony in December, when local television
stations gave gavel-to-gavel coverage and Cable News Network
broadcast extensive chunks of her testimony nationwide.
   During seven days of testimony, she said she was so dominated by
Steinberg that she was unable to defend herself from virtually
systematic beatings, or to protect Lisa.
   She said that Steinberg told her in bed on the night of Nov. 1,
1987, after they had free-based cocaine and while Lisa lay comatose
on their bathroom floor, that he had ``knocked Lisa down and she
didn't want to get up.''
   She said she was unable to bring herself to summon help promptly.
The girl lay there nearly 12 hours before Ms. Nussbaum called an
ambulance; she died of brain damage in a hospital three days later.
   Juror Helena Barthell said the panel ``virtually ignored'' the
testimony, which was sharply challenged by defense lawyers who
stressed Ms. Nussbaum's responsibility in Lisa's death.
   ``Hedda Nussbaum could have saved Lisa's life if she had made
that call'' for medical assistance, Mrs. Barthell said.
   She also said the manslaughter charge was a compromise, with some
jurors arguing for the murder charge and some leaning toward lesser
charges.
   A murder conviction, she conceded, ``certainly ... would have
sent a stronger message.''
   Deliberations had been so heated that jurors nearly came to blows
four times, said foreman Jeremiah Cole, who asked the court for a
few minutes to ``kiss and make up'' before the verdict was announced.
   Ms. Nussbaum's lawyer, Barry Scheck, said his client is
``relieved it's all over.''
   He said she watched the verdict on television at the psychiatric
hospital where she has lived since March.
   ``The possibility of a hung jury was a very frightening prospect
for her. She would have to go through this all again,'' he said.
   Defense lawyers claimed it was Ms. Nussbaum who fatally beat Lisa
out of jealousy over the attention Steinberg paid the child.
Prosecutors _ pointing to Ms. Nussbaum's own severe injuries and
deteriorated mental state _ said she was incapable of such an act.
   Nonetheless, state judge Harold Rothwax instructed the jury to
consider Ms. Nussbaum an accomplice. As such, her testimony had to
be supported by other evidence to secure a murder conviction.
   One question was how Ms. Nussbaum, a former children's book
editor for Random House, could allow herself _ much less the child _
to sustain such damage.
   Another was how bruises on Lisa could have been noticed by a
student teacher at her elementary school and by neighbors, but
failed to come to the attention of child welfare officials. Yet
another issue was the ease with which Steinberg illegally gained
custody of Lisa and the other child, Mitchell, from their unwed
teen-age mothers. The boy has been reunited with his biological
mother.
   At the center of the case were the unknown motivations of
Steinberg, who was disbarred last fall for having falsely claimed a
military exemption from the bar exam. He did not testify at the
trial.
   Steinberg's lack of concern for the girl exhibited ``more than
depraved indifference to human life,'' Assistant District Attorney
Peter Casolaro said at the trial. ``It was monumental indifference
to human life.''

<TEXT>
   City conservatives shunned ultra-rightists who made
a surprisingly strong showing in West Berlin elections and instead
opened talks today on forming a mainstream coalition with leftists.
   The ultra-rightist Republicans, campaigning on a platform of
ridding Berlin of foreigners, captured 7.5 percent of the vote and
11 seats in the West Berlin legislature. It was the first time they
gained a place in that body since their party was formed in 1983.
   However, the conservative Christian Democrats, who suffered heavy
losses in Sunday's vote, ruled out a coalition with Republicans.
   The Republicans' national chairman is Franz Schoenhuber, a
66-year-old former Nazi Waffen SS soldier. Under West Germany's
complicated election laws, the party will also gain two seats in the
national parliament after the December 1990 federal elections.
   National party leaders instructed West Berlin's Christian
Democratic mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, to begin today's coalition talks
with his leftist Social Democratic rival Walter Momper.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats lost a natural ally
when the centrist Free Democrats failed to gain any seats in the
legislature. The two parties had governed West Berlin in a coalition
that also controls the federal government.
   Sunday's voting gave the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats
55 seats each in the 138-seat house, while the far-left Alternative
List came away with 17 seats.
   Momper said he would not govern with the Alternatives as long as
they insist on cutting back the number of Allied troops stationed in
West Berlin.
   The outcome was overshadowed by the success of the Republicans,
who say they have 1,000 card-carrying members in West Berlin and
more than 7,000 nationwide.
   Kohl told a news conference in Bonn on Monday the outcome was
worrisome because of the Republicans' appeal among West Germans, who
are increasingly worried by a wave of foreigners competing for jobs,
housing and social services.
   ``There is an urgent need to discuss these problems and come up
with better solutions,'' Kohl said.
   Mayor Diepgen, calling the elections ``a bitter loss,'' said the
obvious surge in ultra-right support poses a serious challenge for
the leading political parties in the city and country.

   Eddie LeVeque, the last of the original
Keystone Kops, the troupe of slapstick gendarmes whose comic antics
endeared them to a generation of silent film fans, has died at age
92.
   LeVeque, who was born in Mexico, died Saturday, said his son,
Gilbert.
   The actor's first role in a major film was in 1914 in the D.W.
Griffith classic ``Intolerance.''
   He later joined the Keystone production company and appeared as
one of the Keystone Kops, which usually were featured in a series of
misadventures that involved split-second sight gags and an
inevitable chase scene.
   LeVeque quit the studio in 1917 to serve in World War I. That
same year producer Mack Sennett shaped a second group of Keystone
Kops that continued to perform into the 1920s.
   After the war, LeVeque appeared in such epic silent films as
``The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'' with Rudolph Valentino and
``The Black Pirate'' with Douglas Fairbanks Sr.
   He later worked in radio as a disc jockey and continued to play
small roles in films, often cast as a kindly priest.
   He is survived by a son, two daughters and six grandchildren.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize for his struggle against apartheid in South Africa, has
called on a fellow Nobel laureate to join him in mediating the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   Tutu made the offer to 1986 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Elie
Wiesel as he accepted an award Monday night from the Stephen Wise
Free Synagogue in Manhattan.
   ``The idea, I must say, did not come to me `cerebrally,' but in a
vision, because of its symbolic significance, as two men who have
been honored with the Nobel Peace Prize,'' Tutu said at the award
ceremony.
   He said he had not consulted with Wiesel, the author and
Holocaust survivor, before making his proposal. Wiesel was not in
the audience.
   Tutu said he supported Israel's right to territorial integrity
and condemned terrorism, ``But Israel is not infallible,
mercifully.''
   Tutu was honored by the synagogue ``for his leadership in the
struggle against apartheid and for the entire spectrum of civil and
human rights for all peoples.''

Son</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge has released an Amish man
jailed for contempt for refusing to turn over his 6-year-old son for
cancer treatments despite warnings the child will die without
medical help.
   Hardin District Judge Janet Coleman, who had found Danny Mast in
contempt of court Friday, ordered his release Monday after
concluding jailing the father would not help the child, Amos.
   In a brief statement, Coleman said: ``I have done my best to
convey to Mr. Mast the seriousness of his legal position in the hope
that he might relent and not allow this child to die untreated. He
has not done so.''
   But the judge overruled a motion to have all previous orders in
the case canceled _ meaning Mast was still held in contempt of court.
   Amos was diagnosed with cancer in October and was under the care
of Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville. In December, a hearing
was held after the child's physician contacted the Hardin County
attorney about the case. At a second hearing in early January,
hospital officials said the child had not resumed chemotherapy.
   Without the treatment, the boy is expected to live only a few
months, said Assistant County Attorney Chris Shaw.
   ``There's really no doubt in my mind that, barring a miracle,
this boy is going to die,'' Shaw said. ``You keep hoping they're
going to listen to reason.''
   Relatives and family members said the child is not in the
community and may have been taken to another state.
   Monroe Miller, Mast's father-in-law, said last week that he
believes his grandson is being helped by a ``natural'' treatment of
herbs and vitamins.
   Mast is a member of an Amish community of 15 families living in
Sonora in southern Hardin County. Their religion teaches separation
from the world and stresses simplicity as a way of life.

   The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution has approved the main parts of an agreement to transfer
the largest collection of American Indian artifacts from New York to
Washington for permanent display.
   The agreement in principle, reached last week, would create a
national museum of the American Indian on the Washington Mall as
part of the Smithsonian but would keep a smaller satellite museum in
New York City, to be situated in the old U.S. Custom House in lower
Manhattan.
   Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian, said at a press
briefing after the regents met Monday that only technical issues
remain. ``I don't think any are of fundamental importance,'' he said.
   The Museum of the American Indian has for years been trying to
move from a small Upper Manhattan building which is only big enough
to display about 1 percent of the collection of more than 1 million
artifacts. The bulk of the collection has been stored for many years
in a Bronx warehouse.
   Title to the Heye Collection of Indian artifacts would be
transferred to the Smithsonian, pending approval by the New York
state attorney general and state courts.
   Adams indicated he believed a final agreement would go to the
Smithsonian's executive board before May 15, the deadline for
Congress to allocate funds for the national museum in the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1. The Smithsonian cannot build a new museum
without congressional approval and federal money.

<HEAD>Government Report Vindicates Chun, Opposition Cries Foul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A long-awaited government report today
vindicated former President Chun Doo-hwan of corruption and power
abuses during his seven-year rule.
   The three main opposition parties accused the government of
covering up the wrongdoings of Chun, who is a friend of President
Roh Tae-woo and former classmate at military college. Opposition
leaders said they will work to seek the appointment of a special
prosecutor to thoroughly investigate alleged wrongdoing by Chun, his
family and associates.
   In a report ending nearly a year of investigation, the
prosecution said 47 people have been arrested, including 13 members
of Chun's family, a former government intelligence chief, two former
Cabinet ministers, a ruling party lawmaker and a former Seoul mayor.
   Senior prosecutor Park Chong-chul announced the report's findings
and said 20 other people have been booked for indictment but not
detained. Trial dates have not been set.
   Those arrested and indicted are charged with embezzlement and
abuse of authority for personal gain. But none was accused of
raising illegal political funds for Chun _ a main complaint voiced
by the opposition.
   Prosecutor-General Kim Ki-choon said the investigation was
conducted in a ``neutral and independent manner,'' but opposition
parties said the results fall far short of public expectations.
   Rep. Lee Sang-soo, spokesman for the largest opposition Party for
Peace and Democracy, charged the prosecution took its cue from Roh
Tae-woo and did not look into Chun's alleged wrongdoings.
   Chun, 58, left office last February. He has denied any personal
corruption, but surrendered $24 million in illegal political funds
before going into rural exile.
   Radical students and dissidents have demonstrated frequently in
recent months, demanding Chun be punished for alleged corruption and
human rights violations.

   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation
Committee voted unanimously to recommend that Samuel Skinner, head
of the Chicago area transit system, be confirmed as secretary of
transportation.
   The senators took less than five seconds to give voice-vote
approval to President Bush's nominee and send his name to the Senate
floor.
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., praised all of Bush's Cabinet
selections and said that he was ``deeply impressed by the openness,
integrity and the smarts'' of both Skinner and Robert Mosbacher,
whose nomination as commerce secretary also was approved by the
committee.
   Skinner, 50, who is a licensed pilot, promised during his
confirmation hearings last week to support mandatory drug testing
for transportation workers in safety-related jobs and to combat air
terrorism.
   Skinner also said he would work to build up the Coast Guard and
the maritime industry and said he planned to formulate a long-range
national transportation policy.
   Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., said he expected the
Skinner and Mosbacher nominations to be approved by the full Senate
later in the day.

   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Four long-range Soviet missiles slammed
into villages today near the main Soviet withdrawal route and killed
70 people, Moslem guerrillas said.
   Western diplomats said an upsurge in Soviet and government
attacks during the past week appeared to be aimed at pressuring the
guerrillas to reach a political settlement with the Soviet-backed
government in Kabul.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Red
Army is expected to be out of the Kabul area by Feb. 6.
   Moscow pledged in a U.N.-brokered accord last year to remove all
of its more than 100,000 combat troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   Although the final phase of the pullout is in full swing in
Kabul, the diplomats did not predict when the Soviets would leave
other parts of the country, notably Shindand air base in western
Farah Province.
   Jamiat-i-Islami, one of the major Afghan guerrilla factions, said
it received news of today's missile attack in a radio report from
its commander, Ahmad Shah Masood.
   The guerrillas said the SS-1 Scud missiles hit in the Khinja
section of the Panjshir Valley about 30 miles northeast of the
Salang Highway.
   There was no independent confirmation of the missile attacks.
   Official Afghan media have accused Masood of attacking convoys
carrying food to the capital. However, the Jamiat faction said the
convoys also were loaded with arms and ammunition for the Kabul
regime.
   Combined Soviet and Afghan government forces have leveled
villages and killed hundreds of people since Jan. 23 in coordinated
high-altitude bombing attacks, artillery barrages, missile launches
and ground assaults, according to Western and guerrilla sources.
   Most of the attacks were targeted along the Salang Highway, the
Red Army's main pullout route between Kabul and the Soviet border,
they said. But they said villages up to 30 miles away from the road
also suffered.
   Also today, the 11 remaining members of the U.S. Embassy staff in
Kabul left the country a day after closing their mission because of
concerns about fighting in Kabul after the Red Army leaves. The
embassy staff flew out of the Afghan capital aboard a chartered
plane to New Delhi, India, and they are expected to go to Washington
later this week.
   Although the embassy was closed Monday, the Americans could not
immediately depart because Kabul airport was shut by a three-inch
snowfall.
   In Washington on Monday, the State Department accused the Soviet
Union of pursuing what it called a ``scorched earth'' policy as its
troops withdraw.
   By contrast, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said,
U.S.-armed Afghan insurgents were showing restraint toward the
departing Red Army.
   ``The Soviets continue what might even be called a scorched earth
policy, as they continue very, very intensive air activity,'' Redman
said. ``We just don't believe that this kind of a policy is what is
called for at the time when Afghanistan ought to be looking to the
future.''
   One Western diplomat in Islamabad said ``the Soviet bombing and
missile attacks cannot be explained by a putative Soviet desire to
protect its retreating troops.''
   He said the guerrillas ``have not been attacking the withdrawing
Soviet troops on the Salang or elsewhere.''
   ``The situation for survivors of these attacks is bleak,'' said
another diplomat. ``Survivors have been left homeless in the midst
of one of the worst winters in recent memory, in most cases without
provisions.''
   The communists seized power in Kabul in a 1978 coup, touching off
a civil war with Moslem insurgents. Soviet forces intervened in
December 1979 to replace one pro-Moscow government with another,
then remained to fight the guerrillas.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Back Europe's Ban Of Hormone-Treated Beef</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer groups are supporting a European ban
of hormone-treated beef from the United States and say consumers
here also should demand the right to buy meat certified as
chemical-free.
   The Consumer Federation of America and other consumer advocates
are also urging President Bush to reverse the administration's
refusal to let Texas and other states export hormone-free beef while
Europe and the United States spar over the safety of growth hormones.
   The consumer advocates want Bush to negotiate a 90-day
cooling-off period with the European Economic Community to keep the
dispute from escalating into a trade war.
   ``If the European Community and the United States proceed in the
direction that they're going we very well could have a real trade
war in which consumers on both sides of the Atlantic are really
going to be the ones who get hurt,'' Rod Leonard, executive director
of the Community Nutrition Institute, said Monday.
   The EEC has said it will slap tough tariffs on American walnuts
and dried fruit if no progress is made by Feb. 20 to end the dispute
over hormones used by domestic producers to fatten cattle more
quickly.
   The EEC on Jan. 1 banned imports of beef treated with hormones,
contending they are a health threat. The United States disputes
those claims and retaliated against the loss of about $100 million
in annual beef sales by setting $100 million in higher tariffs on a
variety of Common Market goods.
   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower has been working
with the EEC to certify hormone-free beef from Texas and find buyers
for the Lone Star exports.
   But the U.S. Trade Representative's office last week said such a
deal would not be allowed because the U.S. Department of Agriculture
has no way to certify beef is hormone-free.
   Leonard said he believes USDA ``can do a certification procedure
if it wants to'' and questioned the administration's decision to bar
such exports as farmers, inching toward recovery after their worst
recession in decades, have an opportunity to find new markets.
Leonard said a 90-day cooling off period would give Bush time to
develop a hormone-free beef certification procedure.
   The Consumer Federation of American said the EEC's ban is ``an
issue of consumer protection and not trade protection.''
   ``Serious questions have been raised about the necessity and
safety of hormone additives in meat. Through the ban, consumers in
Europe have expressed their preference for hormone-free beef. They
have opted to be safe, rather than sorry, and we believe that
preference must be respected,'' said Sandra Eskin of the CFA, which
represents more than 240 state, local and national organizations.
   She said U.S. consumers should push their preference for
hormone-free beef and urge the USDA to develop a procedure that
certifies beef has not been treated with hormones and other drugs or
chemicals.
   Rich Parker, a spokesman for the American Meat Institute, said
prices would increase if producers stopped using growth hormones.
The AMI contends the hormone issue is a trade barrier that has
``nothing to do with safety,'' Parker said. ``Europe wants to be a
net exporter, not a net importer.''

<HEAD>Man Pleads Guilty to Defeauding Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man accused of marrying at least four women has
pleaded guilty to defrauding two women lured to the altar by his
promises to share an inheritance with them.
   Victor Barr, 49, married at least four women under false
pretenses, lived off their cash and credit, and then deserted them,
federal authorities said.
   He pleaded guilty Monday in U.S. District Court to charges
stemming from two of those marriages. Barr told U.S. District Judge
Barbara Hackett that he married Carol Kelly of Pontiac in April 1988
and defrauded her of $20,000.
   ``I told her I need a wife to marry me for six months and I told
her I'd give her $200,000 for marrying me,'' said Barr, who faces up
to 27 months in prison and a $120,000 fine under terms of his plea
bargain.
   He also admitted marrying Margaret Gearing of Cleveland in July
1988 under false pretenses and defrauding her of $30,000 by using
her credit cards and writing her bad checks to cover expenses.
   When Barr married Gearing, he was already married to Kelly and to
Lois Mauger of Cheektowaga, N.Y., federal investigators said. In
November, he married another woman from Reno, Nev., but she
discovered his scheme and had him arrested.

<HEAD>Authorities Break Up Mafia-Terrorist Arms and Drugs Ring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have broken an international
ring of Sicilian Mafia and right-wing terrorists who trafficked in
drugs and weapons, newspapers reported today.
   Arrest warrants for 72 suspects wanted for criminal association,
arms and drug trafficking have been issued in Italy and abroad,
including the United States and Switzerland, the reports said
quoting authorities at a Monday news conference. Names of suspects
living outside Italy were not immediately disclosed.
   Authorities said they arrested at least 48 people Monday for
involvement in the ring, whose plots included plans to sell French
warplanes to the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau.
   The investigation extends to Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Peru,
Canada and Nigeria, the Turin daily La Stampa said.
   Warrants were issued by Judge Alba Dova of the Tuscan coastal
city of Massa Carrara, where the investigation was coordinated for
more than a year.
   Dova said the link between the Mafia and right-wing extremists
``leads one to think of the existence of an international extremist
right-wing political organization that finances itself through
illegal financial operations and ties with organized crime.''
   Much of the illegal trafficking was arranged through two Italian
import-export firms called Eurogross and Fininvest 2000, authorities
said.
   The ring's activities included deals in stolen art, cars and
foreign currency, with some money recycled through coded Swiss bank
accounts, they said.
   A key figure named in the warrants is Marco Affatigato, a reputed
leader of New Order, an extreme rightist group accused of a string
of terrorist attacks in Italy in the 1970s and early 1980s.
Affatigato is believed to be in France.
   Among Mafia suspects rounded up in raids were members of the
Corleone family, considered Sicily's most powerful Mafia clan, and
of the Minore family from Trapani, a Sicilian port linked to
clandestine drug and arms shipments. The man considered the Corleone
family's ``cashier,'' Michele Cillari, was among more noted figures
arrested on Monday.
   The judge said the investigation stemmed from the 1987 discovery
of arms and drugs aboard a Lebanese ship off Italy's Adriatic coast.
The ship set out from Beirut and was loaded with heroin, hashish, an
anti-tank bazooka, a Soviet grenade-launcher and other arms.
   Initially, it was linked to alleged arms smuggling between Italy
and the Middle East, including clandestine delivery of mines to
Iran. Several Italian industrialists and arms manufacturers were
arrested but later released and charges dropped.
   On Monday, official said documents seized in connection with the
ship led them to the ring. Evidence included false certificates of a
dummy bank called the ``Canadian Credit Bank'' of Detroit.
   The gang allegedly plotted to deliver French Mirage jetfighters
to Guinea-Bissau, acting as middlemen in return for kickbacks,
authorities said.
   The scheme allegedly involved an Italian representative of the
African country and an official of the French aircraft company
Dassault-Breguet. It was not known if the planes were delivered.

<TEXT>
   Spain's Duke of Cadiz, who died after
skiing into a cable at the World Alpine Ski Championships, was
remembered as someone who liked to ``ski fast and drive fast.''
   Alfonso de Borbon y de Dampierre, a 52-year-old first cousin of
King Juan Carlos and member of the international governing body of
ski racing, had been skiing Monday with companions when he collided
with the cable, which was being raised to support a banner at the
finish line of a course at Beaver Creek Resort, officials said.
   No official cause of death has been determined, but he suffered
severe neck lacerations, said Jeff Beavers of the Eagle County
Sheriff's Department.
   King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia in Spain expressed their sorrow
over his death. The victim's brother, Gonzalo de Borbon, said he
would fly from Madrid to Colorado today to bring his body back to
Spain for burial.
   The accident occurred Monday afternoon as the slalom course was
being converted for downhill competition. Members of the ski patrol
and emergency personnel attended to the duke at the scene, but he
was pronounced dead on arrival at Vail Valley Medical Center,
Beavers said.
   Beavers said authorities were continuing to interview witnesses.
   All Monday night events were canceled by World Championship
officials, who ordered flags flown at half-staff and made plans for
a memorial service.
   De Borbon, who was not in the line of succession to the Spanish
throne, had served as Spain's ambassador to Sweden from 1969 to 1973.
   An avid skier, he was president of the Spanish Skiing Federation
from 1977 to 1984 and president of the Spanish Olympic Committee
from 1984 to 1987. He was a member of the Council of the
International Ski Federation.
   ``This is a very sad occasion,'' said Bob Knous, head of the
Vail-Beaver Creek World Championship Organizing Committee. ``This
was something none of us ever hoped to see anywhere, especially at
an event of this magnitude.''
   De Borbon's father was the elder brother of King Juan Carlos'
father. Both men's fathers were the sons of King Alfonso XIII, who
abdicated the Spanish throne in 1931.
   De Borbon was a descendant of Louis XIV, the French Sun King, and
was the Bourbon or ``legitimist'' candidate for king had the
monarchy ever been restored in France.
   In 1972, he married Carmen Franco, granddaughter of the late
Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, but they divorced in 1982.
   In February 1984, he again made headlines following an auto
accident in which the older of his two sons was killed on the way
home from a skiing trip in the Spanish Basque country. A judge ruled
that de Borbon, who was driving, had been negligent and stripped him
of the custody of his other son.
   Francisco Fernandez-Ochoa, the slalom gold medalist at the 1972
Olympics and a close friend of the duke, said de Borbon liked to
``ski fast and drive fast.''
   Referring to the duke's divorce, the fatal auto accident and the
skiing tragedy, Fernandez-Ochoa described the victim as ``an unlucky
person. Bad things happened to him.''
   It was the second tragedy involving a ski official during a major
event in the past year. In the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary, Dr.
Joerg Oberhammer, a prominent Austrian surgeon affiliated with that
country's ski team, was killed when he was knocked into the path of
a snow-grooming machine.

   Emperor Hirohito was given the posthumous name
``Showa'' in a palace ceremony attended today by top government
leaders and court officials.
   The ceremony, held in the Imperial Palace's Pine Room where the
late monarch's body lies in state, is among dozens being performed
before Hirohito is buried Feb. 24.
   Showa, which means ``enlightened peace,'' has been used over 62
years to refer to Hirohito's reign, which began in 1926 and ended
with his death from cancer at age 87 on Jan. 7.
   Among dignitaries at the ceremony were Hirohito's son, newly
enthroned Emperor Akihito, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and
Supreme Court Chief Justice Koichi Taguchi.
   Also today, the Cabinet declared Akihito's Dec. 23 birthday a
national holiday, while Hirohito's birthday on April 29 will be
renamed ``Greenery Day'' and remain a holiday.
   Prince Aya, second in line to the throne after Crown Prince
Naruhito, will return to Britain on Wednesday to continue zoology
studies at Oxford University, Imperial Household Agency officials
said. Aya is to return to Japan for his grandfather's funeral.

   The evacuation flight carrying the last
11 U.S. Embassy staffers out of the besieged Afghan capital narrowly
missed a head-on collision with a Soviet transport plane today, the
two most senior American diplomats said.
   ``We had a near-collision 10 minutes after take-off with an
incoming flight from the north,'' Jon D. Glassman, charge d'affaires
at the closed U.S. Embassy in Kabul said after arriving in New Delhi.
   Jim Schumaker, the second-ranking diplomat at the embassy, said
the Americans' chartered Indian Airlines flight came within a mile
of a head-on collision with the Soviet IL-76 transport plane.
   ``Air traffic control at Kabul is never very good,'' Schumaker
said.
   Both diplomats praised the captain of the Indian Airlines Boeing
737 for his quick and expert action in avoiding a collision.
   ``We drank a champagne toast after crossing the Afghan border,''
Schumaker said.
   The State Department ordered the U.S. Embassy's two diplomats,
four Marine guards and five-member support staff to leave Kabul
because of fears the Afghan army could not protect foreign diplomats
after the Red Army withdraws.
   The Americans are expected to return to Washington this week.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan's civil war nine years ago
and are to be gone by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement.
Moslem insurgents, who get most of their support from the United
States and Pakistan, were not parties to the agreement and predict
victory soon after the Red Army departs.
   The U.S. Embassy closed after an emotional ceremony during which
the American flag was lowered.
   Embassy staff members traveled to Kabul airport today in two
bullet-proof jeeps escorted by an Afghan army car.
   At the airport, Marine Sgt. David Hinkell cut the U.S. flag from
the jeep top, rolled it up and handed it to Glassman.
   Glassman said the embassy would reopen when peace is restored to
Afghanistan.
   ``We'll be back in a few months,'' he said.

   A woman dropped her 4-year-old daughter from a
second-story window, but the child was caught by a passerby and was
uninjured.
   ``I told her, `Don't do it. Don't drop the baby,''' Melvin
Ashley, 25, said he told the mother Monday. ``But then she just
dropped her, and she (the child) fell right in my arms.
   ``I asked her if she was all right and then she stopped crying.''
   Authorities said the mother was taken to the Milwaukee County
Mental Health Complex for observation, and the 4-year-old and two
siblings were being cared for by the Milwaukee County Department of
Social Services.
   Ashley said he was walking down a street when he heard glass
breaking.
   ``She (the childen's mother) was throwing dressing drawers and
stuff out the window,'' he said.
   Ashley said he then saw the woman hold the 4-year-old out the
window by her legs.
   He positioned himself under the window as a crowd of 10 to 20
people gathered on the street and tried to persuade the woman not to
drop the child.
   The girl was covered with blood when she landed in his arms but
she was not cut anywhere, Ashley said.
   The blood ``must have been from the woman when she broke all the
windows,'' he said.
   Ashley said a neighbor took the child while he called police.
   ``I was just glad I was there to help her,'' Ashley said.

<TEXT>
   A man named Noid, apparently annoyed by
Domino's Pizza's ``Avoid the Noid'' ads, held two Domino's employees
at gunpoint for more than five hours before they escaped and he
surrendered, authorities said.
   Kenneth Lamar Noid, 22, told police he thinks Tom S. Monaghan,
owner of the Detroit-based pizza chain and the Detroit Tigers
baseball club, ``comes in his apartment and looks around,'' said
Police Chief Reed Miller.
   Investigators believe Noid was ``having an ongoing feud in his
mind with Monaghan about the `Noid' commercials,'' said detective
Sgt. Mark Bender. ``Apparently, he thinks they're aimed at him.''
   Domino's national TV advertising campaign features the ``Noid,''
a red-hatted, red-caped gremlin who uses every trick he can to make
sure the pizza is not delivered hot and fresh but is never
successful.
   Police said Noid entered the suburban Atlanta store shortly
before 11 a.m. Monday and made one of the employees call police to
tell them he had taken hostages and to stay clear of the area.
   When police arrived, Noid fired four warning shots into the
ceiling of the store, Capt. Dave M. Perkins said. Police did not
return fire.
   ``He said he didn't want to kill them, but if the police came in
he would shoot them,'' Perkins said.
   Noid demanded $100,000, a get-away car, and a science fiction
book titled ``The Widow's Son.''
   He also ordered and ate a pizza.
   One hostage fled the store after 5{ hours and the second escaped
about 15 minutes later while Noid's back was turned, authorities
said.
   Noid gave up minutes later and was charged with two counts of
kidnapping, two counts of aggravated assault and theft by extortion
for demanding the $100,000 from Domino's, Perkins said. He was held
today on $250,000 bond.

   The governor ordered National Guard troops
to help with patient care today at a state hospital, where unionized
employees have staged a sickout since Saturday. Most of the workers
later showed up.
   General Hospital spokesman Dan Caley said hospital officials
requested the troops from Gov. Edward D. Diprete, and the
approximately 60 uniformed Guard members were assigned to work
throughout the hospital.
   ``They're not here for security at all,'' Caley said.
   About 80 employees eventually showed up at the state General
Hospital this morning, out of 106 scheduled to work, Caley said.
   ``Things seemed to have cooled off a little,'' said Fran
Segerson, a spokeswoman for the governor. ``With 80 percent of the
employees working, it seems like some of the employees are getting
tired of this.''
   Talks continued between the hospital and union leaders to end the
sickout by attendants and licensed practical nurses, but Caley had
no details of the talks. The union, which has refused to comment,
reportedly is angry over proposed schedule changes designed to
reduce the hospital's burgeoning overtime bills.
   Segerson said the governor called out the Guard after a meeting
Monday night between Thomas D. Romeo, director of the state
Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals, and

   ``I think that last night they hoped to get the problem resolved,
but when it looked like they couldn't do that, he wanted to ensure
that patient services were not affected,'' Segerson said.

   About 150 tourists and 50 crew
members were evacuated from an Argentine navy oceanographic vessel
after the ship ran aground in the Antarctic, an official report said
today.
   The ship Bahia Paraiso sustained three gashes when it ran aground
Saturday in the Bismarck Strait near the U.S. exploration base
Palmer on the Antarctic Peninsula, the Telam state news agency said.
Three days later, it was listing 11 degrees to its port side in high
winds and heavy seas.
   The tourists, mostly from the United States and Europe, and crew
were taken first to Palmer.
   Some went on to the Chilean air force base on King George Island,
840 miles south of the Chilean port Punta Arenas. Others flew by
military transport to Argentina's naval base at Rio Gallegos in
southernmost Santa Cruz Province, and then on to the capital, Buenos
Aires.
   There were no reported injuries, and many passengers chose to
resume their vacations.
   Crew members and specialists waited at the Palmer base for a
break in the weather that would allow them to return to the ship and
begin repairs.

   A man who ``literally exploded'' was
hospitalized today after he detonated a homemade bomb when a police
officer questioned him about a domestic argument, authorities said.
   James Sherman Adams, 49, was in critical condition at Comanche
Memorial Hospital, a hospital official said.
   Policeman David Schucker, 24, was treated and released after
suffering minor cuts from the explosion Monday night, hospital
spokeswoman Kelly Brack said.
   Schucker responded to a report of domestic disturbance and
stopped a vehicle reportedly involved, police Maj. Robert Martin
said.
   ``After stopping that vehicle, during a routine conversation with
the driver, the driver literally exploded,'' Martin said.
   The man told Schucker that he had an explosive device and set the
device to go off in a few seconds, police Capt. Bob Adamson said.
The man apparently was upset because his estranged wife had obtained
a protective order.
   Shotgun shells, screws, a pager, down from the lining of a jacket
and wires were scattered by the explosion, Martin said.

   A court today acquitted a man who spent 30 years on
death row for the kidnap and murder of a 6-year-old girl.
   It was Japan's fourth case in six years in which a death row
inmate was acquitted of murder in a retrial. In all four cases,
judges said confessions, which defendants made during interrogation
but later recanted, lacked credibility.
   After today's verdict, the court freed Masao Akabori, 59, who had
been sentenced to death by a district court in 1958. The sentence
was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1960, but a retrial began in 1987
in the Shizuoka District Court after four appeals by Akabori.
   ``I am glad I won the appeal because I am innocent. And I am so
thankful to my lawyers and all the people who have supported me and
encouraged me through the past 35 years,'' Akabori said in a
statement.
   His lawyers said he managed to avoid hanging because of an active
support group. Such a long stretch on death row is rare but not
unprecedented in Japan.
   Akabori was arrested two months after 6-year-old Hisako Sano was
kidnapped and strangled March 10, 1954, near her home in Shimada
about 125 miles west of Tokyo.
   Under police questioning, he confessed to the crime, but he later
withdrew the confession and pleaded innocent.
   Today's verdict by a three-judge panel said Akabori's confession
lacked credibility, and there was no other credible evidence linking
him to the crime.
   Akabori's lawyers said he is entitled to $930,200 in government
compensation for his wrongful time behind bars.

   Fliers from the aircraft carrier USS
John F. Kennedy returned home today feeling relieved and proud after
a six-month voyage that included the shooting down of two Libyan
jets over the Mediterranean.
   ``The way the crew reacted was in a very professional manner and
that's what we're all about. We did as we were trained to do,'' said
Capt. Jerry Norris, commander of Airwing 3 aboard the Kennedy.
   Two F-14 Tomcat jet fighters from the Kennedy shot down two
Libyan jets that approached them in a hostile manner on Jan. 4.
   While planes from the Kennedy returned today, the carrier and its
battle group will return to their homeports Wednesday.
   Today's return to the Oceana Naval Air Station and the Norfolk
Naval Air Station coincided with a visit by President Bush to the
carrier USS America at the Norfolk Naval Base, but he had no plans
to greet the aviators.
   A Navy spokesman said he doubted the fliers would feel left out.
``Mostly they're going to be concerned about their families,'' said
Navy spokesman Phil Wilkinson.
   Among the friends and relatives waiting to greet the returning
fliers were Loretta and Clyde Smith of Natrona Heights, Penn., along
with six relatives and a large banner reading ``Welcome Home
Shawn,'' to greet their son, Lt. Cmdr. Shawn Smith.
   This was the third time the family has gathered from around the
country to meet Shawn when he returned from a deployment, Mrs. Smith
said. ``This was the most frightening one of all.''
   The Navy did not release the names of the pilots involved in the
shooting for security reasons.
   The fliers said the shooting was a small part of a deployment
they were relieved to see end on schedule.
   ``It's our job,'' Shawn Smith said. ``Just the long separations
make it hard.''

<TEXT>
   Millions of the nation's poorest working
families are missing out on a federal check of up to $874 a year,
and dozens of labor, church and business groups began a campaign
today to let them know about it.
   Working families with children and incomes of up to $18,576 may
qualify for a portion of the earned-income tax credit. If they
qualify, their tax bills could be wiped out completely _ and they
could get a check even if they owe no tax.
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-profit
Washington-based organization that keeps an eye on federal actions
affecting low- and middle-income Americans, is coordinating a drive
to educate potential recipients of the credit. The campaign is being
underwritten by organized labor, the U.S. Catholic Conference, the
Conference of Mayors and other groups as diverse as Planned
Parenthood and Vietnam Veterans of America.
   ``We are concerned that millions of low-income working families
with children may miss out on a valuable benefit they have earned,''
Robert Greenstein, director of the center, told reporters.
   The 1986 tax overhaul expanded the credit, making it available to
more families. At the same time, the new law eliminated as many as 6
million poorer people from the tax rolls altogether, meaning they
don't even have to file a federal tax return.
   However, they must file a return in order to receive the
earned-income credit. Greenstein and his coalition are distributing
fliers, radio commercials and other educational material that spells
out the credit and how to obtain it.
   ``We think it is almost a crime if the people who are entitled to
these benefits don't obtain them,'' said Kenneth Young, executive
assistant to the president of the AFL-CIO.
   Sharon Daly, director of social policy for the Catholic
Conference, said the nation's 189 dioceses will be asked to place
inserts in church bulletins and lead community discussions to ensure
that poor families are informed of the credit.
   As many as 11 million families are eligible for the credit, which
was enacted in 1975 to provide a bonus that was aimed at keeping
them off the welfare rolls. The benefit was designed essentially to
offset a significant part of the Social Security taxes paid by the
poorest workers.
   The credit begins declining after family earnings exceed $9,840;
it disappears once income hits $18,576.
   The credit cancels out up to $874 of a family's tax bill. If the
family owes no tax, the credit is ``refundable'' _ that is, it can
exceed tax liability. Thus, if a family owes no tax, the government
will mail a check for up to $874.
   Greenstein pointed out that workers who qualify for the credit
may be able to get it in advance in their paychecks through the
year. Too, those who qualified for the credit in the past but did
not file for it may be able to collect retroactive payments for the
past three years.

<TEXT>
   A conservative activist told the Senate Armed
Services Committee today that he encountered Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower in an inebriated condition on several
occasions accompanied by women other than his wife.
   The witness, Paul Weyrich, chairman of the Free Congress
Foundation, has opposed Tower's nomination on grounds he is soft on
Star Wars. Today Weyrich questioned whether Tower had the moral
character to oversee the Pentagon reforms that President Bush has
promised he would initiate.
   ``I have made enough personal observations of this man here in
Washington to have serious reservations about his moral character,''
Weyrich said.
   Weyrich claimed that Bush's transition team received hundreds of
letters criticizing Tower, some containing specific allegations of
``moral impropriety'' against the nominee, but did not bring the
letters to the president's attention.
   Weyrich said he never saw the letters, but ``I have encountered
the senator in a condition lacking sobriety as well as with women he
was not married to.''.
   ``The encounters occurred frequently enough to make an
impression. I did encounter this on a number of occasions,'' he said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the panel, immediately
suggested that discussions of any information Weyrich had on the
nominee's personal life be taken up in a closed session scheduled
this afternoon. Tower was to testify in that session.
   Tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before
his nomination was announced by Bush. In divorce papers filed by his
second wife, Lila Burt Cummings, Tower was accused of ``marital
misconduct.''
   Bush has defended Tower, saying an FBI background check found
nothing that would prevent him from serving as defense secretary.
   Tower, a 63-year-old Texas Republican, served 24 years in the
Senate, including a brief tenure as chairman of the Armed Services
Committee from 1981-84.
   ``He considers SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative) a bargaining
chip. We don't,'' Weyrich has said previously. ``He's not in favor
of military reform. We think military reform is necessary
particularly in this year of budget crunch.''
   Tower told the committee last week he does not ``believe that we
can devise an umbrella that can protect the entire American
population from nuclear incineration. I think that's unrealistic.''
   Tower said a more limited system might work but cautioned that
``it remains to be seen whether that is a realistic objective.''
   In his two days of testimony, Tower also pledged to remain
objective in Pentagon decision-making despite receiving more than $1
million in consulting fees from defense contractors.
   But Jackson, a senior fellow and associate professor at the
Fulbright Institute of International Relations at the University of
Arkansas, questioned Tower's pledge.
   ``Mr. Tower is the wrong man for this job at this time,'' Jackson
said in a telephone interview Monday. ``I plan to focus on how he
symbolizes the revolving door syndrome in the defense culture as he
called it.''
   Jackson, onetime foreign policy adviser to former Secretary of
State Edmund Muskie, said Tower showed little interest in defense
reform when the Texas senator served as chairman of the Armed
Services panel.
   ``He's a bad choice when we need someone whose track record is
sound,'' Jackson said.
   Phillips, president of the National Council for Industrial
Defense, said Monday he is unsure whether Tower will implement the
reform recommendations of the Packard Commission, the presidential
panel that called for strengthening the authority of the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   ``I'm not sure he knows what's involved, what kind of buzzsaw
he'll run into,'' said Phillips.
   Phillips, who heads a non-profit, non-partisan organization that
includes small defense subcontractors, also criticized Tower's
record on foreign sourcing for contracts.
   ``I don't know what his position is,'' Phillips said. ``When he
was on the committee he didn't do anything to help our industries,
then when he left he worked for British Aerospace (as a consultant).
A lot of our people have gone out of business.''

   Israeli troops and allied militiamen
today expelled four Lebanese from Israel's self-proclaimed security
zone in south Lebanon, police said.
   The action brings to 74 the number of people expelled from the
area this month.
   Police said three women expelled _ Majida Ghader, 29, Insaf Ali
Hinnawi, 21, and Youmna Markiz, 21 _ were teachers from the Sunni
Moslem village of Shibaa. A man, Yousef Sleem, 18, was expelled from
Houla.
   Ms. Markiz told reporters in Rashaya, north of the security zone,
that an officer of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia
told her they were expelled ``because we had participated in
demonstrations against the establishment of an Israeli-sponsored
local administration in Shibaa.
   ``They also accused us of inciting our students against this
administration,'' she said.
   On Jan. 25, Israeli troops and the militia expelled 40 civilians
from Shibaa, including seven women and 25 children, after residents
marched to protest creation of a local administration.
   Israel established the 6-to-10 mile deep security zone to curb
guerrilla raids from south Lebanon when it withdrew the bulk of its
army in 1985, three years after invading Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   In an attempt to end Nicaragua's
economic crisis, President Daniel Ortega has announced plans to cut
the budget by nearly half, lay off 35,000 troops and public
employees and end subsidies for basic goods.
   He said in announcing the austerity plan on Monday that city
dwellers would be hardest hit and suggested many move back to the
farm.
   Speaking to the National Assembly, Ortega called for the
cooperation of private business and told landholders the leftist
Sandinista government would no longer confiscate private property.
   However, opposition leaders said they are puzzled by the plan and
won't support it.
   ``Daniel's speech is rather nebulous,'' said Ramiro Gurdian, vice
president of the opposition Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate and
president of a farm owners' organization. He said there was no
agreeement with private businessmen to back the plan.
   Opposition leader Enrique Bolanos said he understood the speech
to mean the government wants to control everything, including
producers' profits, while producers take all the risks.
   ``It doesn't make much sense,'' he said.
   In ending the two-hour, 40-minute address, Ortega told his fellow
3.5 million Nicaraguans that sacrifice is needed to bring the
economy out of crisis and curb inflation, which reached 20,000
percent last year.
   ``I appeal to the sensibility and honesty of all Nicaraguans so
this proposal doesn't turn into a political confrontation,'' Ortega
said. ``Otherwise, we'll be paying with the blood and the future of
our people.''
   He said the federal budget this year would be cut by 44 percent _
461 billion cordobas or about $100 million to $200 million.
   The president said the government would impose a ``war economy''
policy if inflation is not brought under control. He did not
elaborate.
   Ortega said the government will reduce subsidies for basic goods,
but did not provide details.
   He did not say during the speech how many workers the government
plans to lay off. But in a telephone interview with the newspaper El
Nacional in Caracas, Venezuela, he put the figure at 35,000,
including 23,000 from the army and Interior Ministry and 12,000 from
other public institutions. The Sandinista army had 74,000 troops
last year, including reservists and militia.
   Laid-off workers will receive temporary compensation and be
offered agricultural employment, he said, noting that about 10,000
workers are needed for the coffee harvest.
   He suggested, in addition, that laborers who live in cities
consider moving to rural areas to find employment.
   Thousands of Nicaraguans migrated to Managua, the capital, and
other cities to flee the fighting during the 7-year war with the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels in which a preliminary cease-fire was
reached last March.
   Thousands more flooded into cities after Hurricane Joan ravaged
the country in October. The storm killed more than 100 people, left
at least 200,000 people homeless and caused more than $800 million
in economic damage, according too the government.
   Ortega has described storm damages to crops as immeasurable, and
annual Soviet bloc assistance of $500 million has failed to right
the battered economy. Nicaragua once exported rice and beans, but
now imports those staples; shortages have pushed food prices skyward.
   Ortega said the budget cuts will require deep slashes in capital
investment and government credits to agriculture and business.
   State-run banks, he said, will provide new loans ``only to those
who can pay,'' but he said the government would continue
``stimulating private producers, regardless of their political
positions.''
   In another gesture to the private sector, Ortega declared that
government confiscations of private property were a thing of the
past.
   About 85 percent of farmland in Nicaragua is in private hands,
and just 15 percent is owned by the state, he said.
   Ortega also announced that the official and parallel rates of
currency exchange will be merged to eliminate black market demand
for dollars. He did not say what the rate would be.
   The official rate, 2,300 cordobas per dollar, is used to
calculate payment for exports, and the parallel rate, at 4,400
cordobas, is used for those selling dollars.
   The dollar now fetches about 5,500 cordobas on the black market.
   The president blamed Nicaragua's runaway inflation on spending
associated with the Contra war, which by government count claimed
26,500 lives. A United States trade embargo imposed against
Nicaragua in 1985 also reduced government revenues, he said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. attorney for Massachusetts resigned
following months of allegations that he politicized his office and
lied about seeing his predecessor smoke marijuana.
   ``The work of this office is far too important to be sidetracked
by any controversy,'' Frank L. McNamara Jr. said in announcing his
resignation Monday.
   In his brief statement, McNamara did not mention a continuing
Justice Department investigation into his conduct that staff members
said had hindered the office's activities.
   He said he intended to return to private practice.
   Jeremiah O'Sullivan, head of the New England Organized Crime
Strike Force, was named the interim head of the office and was sworn
in this morning before U.S. Judge Edward F. Harrington in Boston.
   McNamara, a 41-year-old Republican, has been the target of a
Justice Department investigation since November, when investigators
found no evidence to support allegations that he saw William F. Weld
smoke marijuana. During the probe, McNamara admitted to smoking
marijuana himself.
   On Friday, 28 of the 39 assistant U.S. attorneys working for
McNamara wrote to U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, urging him
to expedite McNamara's departure.
   ``Mr. McNamara's conduct and performance while United States
attorney is resulting in a loss of confidence in the adminstration
of justice,'' the letter said. ``The credibility and operations of
this office will continue to be damaged ... unless he is removed.''
   Prosecutors who had been critical of McNamara privately expressed
relief over his decision to leave.
   President Reagan nominated McNamara to replace Weld in April
1987, when Weld ascended to head the Justice Department's criminal
division. But McNamara's confirmation was held up while the FBI
investigated his failure to pay income tax for several years, and
irregularities in his congressional campaign finances after his
unsuccessful 1982 race against then-House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip''
O'Neill Jr.
   During the confirmation process, McNamara said he believed Weld
was trying to scuttle his nomination and told investigators that he
had seen Weld drunk on a couple of occasions. He also alleged he had
seen Weld smoke marijuana at a 1982 wedding party.
   A Justice Department investigation failed to support McNamara's
charges, and McNamara admitted that he had smoked marijuana at a
later date.
   Last weekend, McNamara denied urging a federal investigation into
marijuana-smoking charges against Democratic U.S. Rep. Joseph
Kennedy II and Robert Farmer, the top fund-raiser for Gov. Michael
Dukakis's presidential campaign.
   McNamara said the allegation stemmed from an unsubstantiated FBI
report that was leaked to reporters.
   In November, several assistant prosecutors said McNamara pursued
an investigation of a prison land deal by the Dukakis administration
in an attempt to discredit Dukakis, then the Democratic nominee for
president.
   Shortly after McNamara's announcement Monday, Dukakis commended
him for resigning, saying, ``It was long overdue.''

   The strongest high pressure system in North American history
tightened its frigid grip on Alaska, and that arctic air hit Montana
today after high wind blew railroad cars off their tracks and
knocked down a grain elevator.
   Balmy weather that set records for warmth in many cities ended
abruptly today in Montana, where Great Falls dropped to 10 degrees
below zero this morning, after a record high of 62 on Monday, the
National Weather Service said. The temperature at Great Falls
dropped 48 degrees within three hours after the cold front of arctic
air passed over the city.
   Nearly two dozen rural North Dakota schools closed today when
strong northerly wind reduced visibility to near zero with blowing
snow and dropped wind chill factors to 45 degrees below zero.
Authorities advised no travel in the northeastern part of the state.
   It was 51 degrees below zero Monday morning in Fairbanks, Alaska,
where the temperature has risen above minus 40 only once during the
past three weeks. There were unofficial readings of 75 below in some
parts of Alaska, the weather service said.
   The severe cold in Alaska closed schools, brought state
government to a virtual standstill and was tentatively blamed for
the crash of a Canadian military transport plane outside Fairbanks.
High wind that produced extreme wind chill factors also disrupted
the flow of oil through the Alaska pipeline by preventing ships from
entering Valdez harbor to load up.
   The cold air is being caused by a dome of extremely high
atmospheric pressure over Alaska. The barometer at Northway, Alaska,
rose to a record high of 31.74 inches of mercury, the weather
service reported today.
   Just the day before, Big Delta, Alaska, reached a high of 31.54
inches, breaking the previous record for North America of 31.53
inches, recorded in the Yukon Territory of Canada in 1974.
   Although temperatures in much of Alaska have risen slightly since
the weekend, the moderation has been accompanied by rising winds
that have disrupted ship traffic and created dangerously low
wind-chill readings.
   The arriving cold front produced snow today over Montana and
North Dakota and wind chill factors were between 30 and 40 below
zero over North Dakota.
   Before the front arrived, weather service forecasters in Great
Falls said it would be the ``coldest arctic system in five years''
to hit the state.
   ``This is a very dangerous storm and should not be taken
lightly,'' the weather service said in a special statement issued
Monday.
   Meanwhile, wind up to 124 mph hammered Montana on Monday, blowing
at least 10 railroad freight cars off their tracks near Browning,
toppling a grain elevator near Cut Bank and fueling an unusual
mid-winter range fire, authorities said. No injuries were reported.
   The wind was caused by the flow of air between a high pressure
system over Utah and lower pressure along the arctic cold front, the
weather service said.
   It coincided with a period of record high temperatures in Montana
and across much of the country.
   High temperature records fell in places as far apart as Great
Falls, Mont., where it was 62; Burlington, Vt., where it was 45; and
Minneapolis-St. Paul, where it was 48. Miami tied its record for the
date of 82.
   Although Alaska is exporting its cold weather, no significant
warming is expected there for at least five days, the weather
service said.
   There was, however, some good news for Alaskans on Monday when
the Coast Guard reopened the Valdez Narrows between the Port of
Valdez and Prince William Sound late Monday after winds abated
enough to allow safe tanker operations.
   Gusts approaching 100 mph had forced the closure of the port for
a day, prompting the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. to reduce flow in
the trans-Alaska oil pipeline by 65 percent.
   Alyeska spokesman Tom Brennan said the pipeline should be able to
resume normal production of about 2 million barrels a day by late
Tuesday. The state treasury had stood to lose $3 million a day in
lost taxes and royalties if the closure had continued.
   The temperature crept a few degrees above zero in south-central
Alaska on Monday, 55 mph gusts blew windows out of a downtown
Anchorage office building. Schools were closed in several places
around the state, and the state court system shut down out of
concern for the safety for jurors.
   Gov. Steve Cowper ordered all non-essential state employees in
Fairbanks to stay home until there was a break in the weather.
   The cold continued to hamper exercises designed to show the
military's ability to function in harsh arctic conditions. Canada
pulled its troops out of Brim Frost '89 after eight men were killed
when a transport plane crashed while trying to land at Fort
Wainwright near Fairbanks.

<HEAD>International Survey Finds US Youth Among Worst in Science, Math</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds last 2 grafs with reaction</HEAD>

   American teen-agers came out at the bottom of
the heap in a survey of math and science performance among students
in five countries and four Canadian provinces, the Educational
Testing Service reported today.
   The low math performance levels are ``a matter for grave
concern'' while the science results ``are sobering and pose a
serious challenge to our position in the world community,''
according to the report, called ``A World of Differences.''
   The ETS study is its first international assessment of
educational progress, a counterpart to the group's periodic national
assessments in various academic fields. It was financed by the
National Science Foundation and the Department of Education.
   Findings were based on tests of approximately 24,000 13-year-olds
in Ireland, Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States,
British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec. The last three
were divided into French- and English-speaking samples.
   In all countries and provinces, the more time spent watching
television, the poorer student performance in both math and science,
the report found. And in all but two, more than 50 percent of the
students reported spending an hour or less each day doing homework
in all their subjects. The exceptions were Ireland and Spain, where
two hours or more was the norm.
   The survey revealed that almost all U.S. 13-year-olds have
mastered math basics and know everyday science facts. But ETS notes
that ``national assessments consistently reveal a weakness in
higher-order thinking skills'' and this is borne out in the
international assessment.
   Korean students demonstrated the highest overall mathematics
achievement while those from the United States and Ontario (the
French speakers) showed the lowest.
   For example, the report said, 78 percent of the Korean
13-year-olds can use intermediate mathematics skills to solve
two-step problems, compared with only 40 percent in the United
States and French-speaking Ontario.
   Also in Korea, 40 percent of the students understand measurement
and geometry concepts and can solve even more complex problems _
compared with under 10 percent in the United States and
French-speaking Ontario.
   Despite their poor performance, the ETS report said, two-thirds
of U.S. students said they considered themselves ``good at
mathematics.'' Only 23 percent of Korean students, the highest
achievers, shared that attitude.
   That only 40 percent of the U.S. students can solve two-step
problems ``is a matter for grave concern,'' ETS said. Percentages
for more complicated tasks ``are even more modest and suggest that
the pool of trained talent from which to draw our future scientists,
engineers and technicians is small indeed.''
   Based on comparisons with more successful participants in the
assessment, ETS suggests examining the impact of heavy television
watching, the small amount of math homework typically done, and the
importance attached to math by schools and society in general.
   On the science front, youths in Korea and British Columbia turned
in the best performance. The United States, along with Ireland and
French-speaking Ontario and New Brunswick, ``perform well below the
mean,'' the report said.
   ``The United States has traditionally thought of itself as
technologically innovative and in the forefront in science,'' ETS
said. ``These results are sobering and pose a serious challenge to
our position in the world community.''
   More than 70 percent of the youngsters in Korea and British
Columbia can use scientific procedures and analyze scientific data
while only 35 percent to 40 percent of their peers in the bottom
four samples showed the same degree of competence, the report said.
The U.S. results are ``clearly unacceptable,'' it said.
   Gordon Ambach, executive director of the Council of Chief State
School Officers, called the ETS report ``striking and challenging''
_ particularly its finding that U.S. students, who did worst in
math, think they're good at it.
   ``Before we feel `good' about our performance, we had better test
it against the competition,'' Ambach said in a statement. ``The
United States cannot be internationally competitive with our
13-year-olds at the bottom in mathematics and near the bottom in
science achievement.''

<HEAD>Wife Sentenced in Plot To Kill Husband</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge sentenced a woman to 3{ to nine
years in prison for plotting to murder her estranged husband and
using her teen-age son to hire someone to do the job.
   Carol Boyle-Lawton, a 39-year-old mother of three, pleaded guilty
last September to charges of solicitation to commit murder and
corruption of minors.
   Montgomery County Judge William H. Yohn on Monday ordered her
jailed in the state prison at Muncy.
   Assistant District Attorney Barbara McNulty presented testimony
at the two-day sentencing hearing that Ms. Boyle-Lawton a year ago
told her son Michael Boyle, then 17, that she needed his help to
kill her husband, Charles Lawton, to ``get him out of her hair'' and
collect on his $300,000 insurance policy.
   Michael Boyle found a ``hired killer'' in a classmate at
Wissahickon High School near Ambler, who was actually a state
trooper posing as a student while investigating drug trafficking at
the school, officials said.
   Trooper Mark Fulton testified that he met with Ms. Boyle-Lawton
several times to plan the killing and that she gave him money for a
gun and silencer.
   She provided him with a $1,000 down payment, pictures of her
husband and a written description of him, Fulton said.
   The trooper secretly wore electronic equipment to record their
conversations. Portions of the wiretap were played back in the
courtroom, including Ms. Boyle-Lawton's voice stating amid
obscenities, ``I want him dead. I want the insurance.''
   Ms. Boyle-Lawton said she had second thoughts about killing her
husband and had tried to back out of it.
   ``I wanted to get out, but he (Fulton) was the one who pursued
it,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Sultan Qaboos of Oman has banned tourists
from sea turtle nesting beaches to allow the endangered species to
breed in private, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Qaboos decreed that no one is allowed to watch the turtles in the
area around Ras al Hadd, about 125 miles south of the capital,
Muscat, according to the Oman daily, the Observer.
   Campers have been disturbing the turtles and leaving trash along
their nesting beaches, the largest in the Indian Ocean, the sultan
said.
   These beaches are of ``national, regional and worldwide
importance for the survival of this species which is threatened with
extinction,'' he said.
   ``To prevent further disturbance of the turtles and damage to the
environment, it has been decided that camping and turtle watching by
day or night is prohibited,'' the decree said.
   A government survey conducted from 1977 to 1980 highlighted major
nesting and breeding areas of the sea turtles. Omani rangers were
trained to take over protection and control activities in 1979 so
that the turtle population could be monitored properly.

<HEAD>Soviets Acknowledge 111 Murders in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet government, in keeping with a new policy
to disclose crime statistics, said Tuesday that 111 murders were
committed in the entire country in January, including one policeman
killed in the line of duty.
   Militia Col. Yuri Arshenevsky, a spokesman for the Interior
Ministry, was quoted by Tass as saying previously classified crime
statistics henceforth ``will be available for everyone.''
   The first figures released as part of the new policy showed 93 of
the 111 January murders had been solved and that most ``were
committed at home due to drunkenness and jealousy,'' the official
news agency said.
   In January 1988, New York City reported 152 cases of murder and
non-negligent manslaughter.
   Tass said 137 holdups were committed in January 1989, only 61 of
which were solved. The report added that drivers of unregistered
taxis increasingly are being victimized.
   ``One militia serviceman was killed this month when performing
his official duty of maintaining public order, and 12 were
injured,'' the report said. It added the militia personnel, the
Soviet Union's uniformed police force, used firearms 11 times during
the month and that investigation showed each case was justifiable.
   Arshenevsky said the ministry will begin publishing a statistical
bulletin and ``in due course, possibly, all people who wish will be
able to subscribe to it.''
   Soviet authorities used to provide no information about domestic
crime, and the state-controlled media ignored the subject, but under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of greater openness, the
subject often is discussed in the media. Some particularly
noteworthy cases, such as airplane hijackings and even the recent
firebombing of a private cooperative restaurant in Moscow are widely
reported.
   Pravda published a report by the Interior Ministry in January
that the crime rate in the Soviet Union had soared by 17 percent
during 1988. The report, however, gave no figures for individual
crimes.

   An 80-year-old woman faces a possible
jail term and hundreds of dollars in fines for six citations
accusing her cats of digging up a neighbor's shrubs and using his
yard and van as a litter box.
   The city's Animal Control Department issued the citations against
Nan Farris over a six-month period because of complaints by her
neighbor. Mrs. Farris was ordered into Municipal Court this
afternoon to answer the citations.
   If convicted, she faces $943 in fines and an unspecified jail
term.
   ``The whole thing is about the silliest thing I've ever heard
of,'' she said. ``This thing is crazy, and I don't know why it's
happening.''
   The city takes a different view.
   ``Unfortunately, there is a violation involved _ animal at large
_ and it is normally our policy to prosecute,'' a spokeswoman for
the city attorney told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
   The neighbor, Ralph Neal, said he lived in a neighborhood overrun
by cats and didn't see any humor in the situation.
   ``All I want is for my property to be left alone,'' he said last
summer. ``I have a right to plant shrubs without getting my hands in
cat stuff.''
   Charles Baldwin, Mrs. Farris' attorney, wrote to the city
attorney's office seeking dismissal of the citations.
   ``I would appreciate it if the great city of Fort Worth could
find in its heart to show mercy and dismiss these tickets, as I
don't believe a conviction in this case would serve as a deterrent
to other cats with a compulsion to violate the law,'' Baldwin wrote.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, flanked by
the U.S. attorneys from New York, Chicago and Kansas City, today
announced formation of special task forces to target ``crime in the
suites,'' primarily securities and commodities fraud.
   The Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Forces, including 15
additional assistant U.S. attorneys, will be located in six cities:
New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Kansas City and
Denver.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in New York and U.S. Attorney
Anton Valukas in Chicago already have undertaken substantial
investigations of the markets in those two cities.
   ``We are undertaking to bring this additional firepower to bear
on behalf of investors who might otherwise run the risk of being
defrauded or lose confidence in the market,'' Thornburgh said.
   He said the task forces were being formed to ``combat what can
aptly be called crime in the suites.'' Fraud is being committed
``under the guise of respectability in the financial and securities
markets,'' he said.
   In addition, Thornburgh said the Treasury loses more than $90
billion a year as a result of tax fraud, and white-collar crime has
been a factor in many recent business failures, including many of
the bank and savings and loan closings.
   There was no immediate word on how much the new effort will cost.
Those involved in the task forces will be senior, experienced
prosecutors who will be replaced in their current jobs by new
attorneys, Edward S.G. Dennis, assistant attorney general in charge
of the Justice Department's criminal division, said at a news
conference.
   The task forces will concentrate on the most complex and
difficult frauds, including stock loan frauds, precious metals
fraud, ``parking'' of securities with buyers concealing how much of
a stake they have in a company's stock, and major bank and brokerage
frauds, plus tax evasion, obstruction of justice and perjury,
Thornburgh said.
   ``These investigations are difficult and require the
sophisticated efforts of experienced prosecutors,'' Thornburgh said.
``They are not made by breaking down the door and seizing the
evidence.''
   Agents from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal
Revenue Service, the Postal Inspection Service, the FBI and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission also will be involved in the
probes.
   Giuliani, who is leaving his post today after five years, made a
name for himself in part by attacking insider trading on Wall Street
and has long called for additional money to uncover fraud in the
securities markets.
   Valukas of Chicago supervised a two-year undercover investigation
of the ntion's largest commodity markets, resulting in allegations
that as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated
customers and profited themselves in illegal trades.
   Under the new task forces, the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan will get six additional assistant U.S. attorneys, while
the offices in Chicago and Los Angeles will get three each, and San
Francisco, Kansas City and Denver will get one apiece. An
unspecified number of investigators, paralegal workers and other
support personnel will be added to those offices as well.
   In addition to Giuliani, Valukas and Dennis, Thornburgh was
joined at the news conference by Benito Romano, who becomes interim
U.S. attorney for Manhattan on Wednesday after Giuliani steps down,
and Robert Ulrich, U.S. attorney in Kansas City and chairman of the
attorney general's U.S. Attorneys Advisory Committee.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he will insist on
tighter controls and higher quality from military contractors in a
drive to ``wring the last drop of waste and mismanagement out of the
way we buy our weapons.''
   He said those steps are vital to building a national consensus in
support of a strong defense.
   Bush, on first trip out of Washington as president, made his
remarks in a speech on the deck of the aircraft carrier America at
the huge Norfolk Naval Base to an audience of thousands of Navy
personnel and contractor employees.
   Standing coatless in temperatures in the 50s, Bush coughed
frequently and spoke in a raspy voice, evidence of a cold that has
plagued him for nearly a week. ``Excuse the cough here,'' he said.
   After the speech, Bush had lunch on the ship with enlisted men.
He said he was feeling better but that his throat was bothering him
so much he thought he might not be able to make it through his
speech and had been ``just croaking away'' during it.
   Touching on cost overruns and the current criminal investigation
into Pentagon purchasing practices, the president said:
   ``Even if overruns are not new, they are still wrong _ and hurt
the national security, particularly when budgets are tight. We want
tighter controls and higher standards in weapons procurement.''
   Bush, who was a carrier-based Navy pilot in World War II, said
the ``first bulwark of our national defense is our national will. If
our will is ruptured, our ship of state cannot sail _ or at least
sail safely.
   ``I firmly believe that the vital first step to broadening our
national consensus on defense is to wring the last drop of waste and
mismanagement out of the way we buy our weapons,'' he said. ``And
that's what we intend to do.''
   The Justice Department is pursuing a 2-year-old investigation of
alleged purchasing fraud. The case focuses on charges that private
consultants, hired by military contractors, bribed Defense
Department officials to obtain inside information that gave
companies an edge in bidding for Pentagon work.
   The probe so far has led to guilty pleas by several individuals
and one defense-contracting firm the indictment of another
contractor.
   Some 5,500 crew members stood at parade rest on the flight deck
of the 1,048-foot-long carrier as Bush spoke. Several hundred
civilian contractor employees and some members of Congress also were
were in the crowd.
   Taking note of the setting, the president said: ``You know, as an
old carrier pilot, today is a very special day for me. I can't help
thinking of the carrier I once sailed on, the USS San Jacinto.'' He
said World War II-vintage carriers were much smaller, ``had narrow
decks, smaller planes, no electronics.''
   The president used the occasion to emphasize his program to
highlight public service, praising members of the military for the
sacrifices they make.
   ``In the years ahead I want to make sure that those who build our
ships, planes and weapons live up to the standards of service,
dedication and duty that this crew and this shipyard set,'' he said.
   Bush predicted that one day peace and freedom will triumph
worldwide.
   ``And on that day, who were the heroes, generations to come will
ask. Who drove the chariots of fire across the sky? Who brought that
day to the earth. And the answer will be you.''
   The president pledged to be not only commander-in-chief but a
friend to the military. ``And together we will work to spin the
gossamer thread of human dreams into a sturdy fabric of peace that
will last for generations to come,'' he said.

   Amnesty International today told the U.N. Human
Rights Commission that Israel has killed about 60 Palestinians in
the occupied territories by misusing tear gas.
   A PLO spokesman, meanwhile, told the 43-nation commission that
Palestinian children were being killed in ``Israeli gas chambers.''
Nabil Ramlawi, a Palestine Liberation Organization representative,
said the Israeli practices were ``reaching war crime proportions.''
   ``It's all a great lie,'' said Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel.
   Ramlawi charged that pregnant Arab women were beaten, causing
them to miscarry, and that organs were stolen from dead Palestinians
to be used in transplant operations in Israeli hospitals.
   A text of Ramlawi's speech was not available, but an unofficial
summary paraphrasing his speech said his comments on ``Israeli gas
chambers'' seemed to refer to the use of tear gas.
   The 13-month Palestinian revolt in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip has claimed the lives of 370 Palestinians and 15
Israelis. The Palestinians are protesting occupation by Israel,
which seized the lands from neighboring Arab states in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Amnesty's statement said it was gravely concerned because Israeli
authorities ``appear so far to have condoned if not encouraged the
excessive use of force, knowing that it would result in the death or
injury of thousands of people.''
   Amnesty said about 300 civilians have been shot and killed by
Israeli soldiers during the uprising, and that thousands of other
people were shot and injured, many critically.
   ``Deaths in the occupied territories have also been caused by the
apparently deliberate misuse of tear gas, fired for example into
hospitals and homes,'' Amnesty said. ``This has happened despite
explicit instructions from the manufacturer not to use tear gas in
confined spaces as it is potentially lethal.''
   It said about 60 people were reported to have died in ``tear-gas
related incidents, some of them as a direct result of its misuse.''
   Pazner denied all the allegations. ``It's all nonsense,'' he
said. ``Israel does all it can to cause the minimum damage to
property and, of course, with respect to human life. Israel has
certainly not shot into hospitals.''
   Amnesty said only three Israeli soldiers were reported to have
been convicted following fatal shootings, with the longest sentence
being 18 months in jail for manslaughter. Amnesty said a few other
soldiers drew lesser terms for punitive beatings.
   ``No prosecutions in cases of apparently deliberate misuse of
tear gas resulting in deaths are known to have been initiated,'' it
said.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
arrives Wednesday to put the final touches on preparations for the
first Sino-Soviet summit since the two communist giants split in
bitter rivalry 30 years ago.
   Shevardnadze's visit comes after a year of rapid progress in
bilateral relations expected to culminate this spring when Mikhail
S. Gorbachev becomes the first Soviet leader to travel to China
since 1959.
   During his three-day stay, Shevardnadze is to hold two rounds of
talks with his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, and will meet with
Premier Li Peng. He is also to travel to Shanghai for a meeting
Saturday with China's top leader, Deng Xiaoping.
   Shevardnadze is not scheduled to meet Communist Party head Zhao
Ziyang, Eastern European sources said. China apparently wants to
wait for Gorbachev before officially recognizing a restoration of
relations between the two parties.
   Qian, who in December became the first Chinese foreign minister
to hold talks in Moscow in 32 years, told Australian Foreign
Minister Gareth Evans on Monday that the Cambodian conflict would be
high on the agenda.
   Soviet support for Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia has been the
last and hardest sticking point in Sino-Soviet discussions on
normalizing political ties.
   But China, apparently satisfied that Moscow wants Vietnam to end
its war against the Chinese-backed resistance in Cambodia, accedes
that conditions for a summit have been met.
   The Gorbachev visit, which could come as early as the second half
of March, would be the first since Nikita S. Khrushchev met his
ideological foe Mao Tse-tung in Beijing in 1959.
   Khrushchev, already feuding with Mao over the leadership and
direction of world communism, at that meeting rescinded an offer to
provide China a prototype atomic bomb. The next year, Moscow
withdrew more than 1,000 technicians and ended all assistance for
China's industrial and military development.
   Relations reached a nadir in 1969 when troops along the border
clashed and Mao called on the nation to prepare for all-out war.
   Political normalization talks started in 1982, but made little
headway because of what China calls the ``three obstacles'':
Cambodia, the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and Soviet military
presence along the Chinese border.
   But 1988 proved ``particularly auspicious'' for Sino-Soviet
relations, the authoritative weekly Beijing Review said in its
latest edition. It cited Gorbachev's decision to leave Afghanistan
and his announcement of major troop reductions in Soviet-ally
Mongolia and along the Sino-Soviet border.
   Last August the two sides for the first time held direct talks on
how to solve the Cambodian conflict, and in October they settled
most of their disputes along the eastern sector of the 5,000-mile
border.
   Qian, returning from his historic visit to Moscow in December,
said, ``the most important result was that we started the
normalization process.''
   But the Chinese also emphasize there will be no regression to the
relationship of the 1950s, when the newly founded communist state in
China depended on Soviet economic aid and followed the Soviet lead
in international affairs.
   Normal relations with Moscow, the Beijing Review said in an
indirect reference to the United States, ``will not affect the
development of friendly relations between China and other countries.
   Washington, whose own normalization of relations with China was
in part spurred by common concern over the Soviet military threat,
has welcomed the Sino-Soviet rapprochement, saying it will ease
tensions.

   Speaker Jim Wright today was conducting a rare,
hurry-up survey of House members that leaves open the possibility of
a public vote on the 50 percent congressional pay raise scheduled to
take effect next week.
   Wright, asked if he would schedule a vote should members demand
one in the survey, said, ``If the members want it, yes, of course.''
   But House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said, ``I don't
think there will be a vote.'' He predicted that in return for the
raise becoming law on Feb. 8, the House will approve a day later a
package of outside-income and campaign-finance restrictions applying
to members.
   In the survey sent to House members late Monday, the speaker said
he wanted to be ``faithful to the wishes'' of lawmakers, and asked
whether they demanded a vote before Feb. 8.
   An Associated Press survey of the 100 senators, meantime, found
that 88 plan to vote against the pay raise and six for it, with the
other six either undecided or unwilling to disclose their position.
   Wright awaited the replies of his colleagues as the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee began two days of hearings on the
issue that has dominated the early days of the congressional session.
   Lloyd Cutler, the chairman of a federal pay commission that
recommended the increase, defended the proposed $45,000 raise before
the panel but said lawmakers should retain a similar increase for
judges and federal bureaucrats if they don't accept it for themelves.
   Wright has acted in other ways to blunt the impact of the
proposal to raise congressional pay from $89,500 to $135,000.
Negotiators for the speaker and the Republican leadership have
tentatively agreed to major elements of a package to severely
restrict outside income.
   Wright said he would keep the anwers confidential but asked
members, ``Tell me how you really feel.''
   In addition to asking about a vote, Wright asked if members:
thought the raises proposed by former President Reagan were fair;
would cut the 50 percent proposal to 30 percent, thus offsetting
what House members can keep in speech honoraria; would support a
strict ban on all honoraria, and would vote against rescinding the
raise if it meant a loss of income, assuming an honoraria ban passes.
   Most of the six senators who told the AP they planned to vote for
the raise said they will do so only if honoraria are banned in
return.
   It was unclear how many of the possible ``yes'' votes in the
survey were firm, since the language of the pay rejection resolution
was still under discussion. More than a quarter of the Senate has
sponsored legislation that would roll back the increase if it
becomes law on Feb. 8 as expected.
   Senate leaders also are negotiating whether to restrict outside
income beyond a simple ban on honoraria _ the catchall term covering
speaking fees, appearances and articles.
   House negotiators representing the leadership in both parties
have tentatively worked out restrictions that range far beyond an
honoraria ban.
   The raise from $89,500 to $135,000 for rank-and-file lawmakers
can only be stopped if both houses reject the increase. Senate
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, has promised senators a
vote on rejecting the pay plan, but House Democratic leaders have
said they will not allow a vote.
   The pay proposal, submitted to Congress in former President
Reagan's final budget, would give lawmakers, federal judges and top
political appointees in the executive branch 50 percent increases.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said he will vote for the pay
raise but keep only the amount that will replace the money he now
earns from honoraria.
   Dodd said it is a politically tough choice, and he was critical
of those who would ``vote no and take the dough.''
   ``To me, that's the height of hypocrisy. That is why people have
so much difficulty with Congress and politicians,'' he said.
``That's where peoples' stomachs begin to turn. You've got to be
honest about it.''
   Several senators opposed to the raise said they will return the
money to the government or give it to charity.
   Those who said they will support a raise in some form included
Dodd, James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., Spark M. Matsunaga, D-Hawaii,
Mitchell, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
   Senators who said they were undecided or refused to disclose
their views were Glenn, Slade Gorton, R-Wash., Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, and
William V. Roth Jr., R-Del.
   The remaining senators said they are against the raise.
   In the House, the tentative agreement on outside income is
designed in part to soothe public anger over the size of the
increase and the lack of a House vote.
   The package, according to leadership sources, would:
   _End the honoraria system, which has allowed rank-and-file House
members to keep up $26,850 of the money they earn each year from
speeches, articles and other appearances.
   _Abolition of the ``grandfather'' loophole in campaign financing
law. The loophole has allowed 190 House members who were in office
as of Jan. 8, 1980, to stockpile more than $39 million in surplus
campaign money for their personal use. The provision does not apply
to senators.
   _Restrict travel, probably through time limits, that is often
paid for by special interests who invite lawmakers for speeches and
plant tours. This would prevent members from getting long vacations
at resorts, even if they speak for free.
   _Restrict non-honoraria income, such as fees for serving on
corporate boards.

   Afghan guerrillas who have fought
Marxist regimes since 1978 say they want a non-aligned Islamic
republic, but not necessarily the kind an Arab nation or the
Persians of Iran would create.
   ``The people of Afghanistan are Moslems,'' Hamed Karzai said, but
added: ``We have lived in that location for thousands of years. It's
a question of culture.
   ``He's an Arab, I'm an Afghan. He wears skirts, I wear this,'' he
said, pointing to his loose cotton trousers and knee-length shirt
called a shalwar kameez. ``And we are absolutely different from
Iran.''
   Karzai is a spokesman for the seven-party Islamic Unity of Afghan
Mujahedeen based in this ancient, dusty frontier city, and a
political officer of the Afghan National Liberation Front.
   The front is considered one of the more moderate,
Western-oriented parties of mujahedeen, or ``holy warriors.'' Karzai
acknowledged that conservative groups have more power within the
alliance and said there are differences on how to define an Islamic
state even within the Afghan context.
   Shahruk Gran, a field commander of the moderate National Islamic
Front of Afghanistan, said all the guerrillas are Moslems but that
does not mean they fit a specific political mold.
   ``Some people misinterpret Islam _ some putting it on a narrow
path and some on a broader one,'' he said, ``but I think for all of
us it means having the right of choosing our own government.''
   He and the other mujahedeen believe that right was usurped in
April 1978 when communists seized control of Afghanistan in a
military coup. The insurrection began soon afterward.
   More than 5 million Afghans have fled the country, most of them
to Pakistan, the neighbor to the east, and the others to Iran, on
Afghanistan's western border. The guerrillas use refugee camps as
bases and most of their support comes from the United States and
Pakistan.
   Soviet military forces intervened in December 1979 and an
estimated 115,000 Red Army soldiers were in Afghanistan when they
began withdrawing May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement. All are to
be gone by Feb. 15.
   Gran's reference to broad and narrow paths illustrates the
difference between the three moderate parties and the four groups of
hardliners who describe themselves as Islamic revolutionaries first
and Afghans second.
   Among the most powerful conservative factions is the
Hezb-i-Islami faction led by Gulbaddin Hekmatyar.
   ``Our government should be one of Moslems, especially those who
have shed their blood for Allah against the foreign invaders and
their puppets,'' he said in an interview last 1988. ``The future of
Afghanistan is for those who have fought for it and no one else.''
   Pressure has been brought from outside, particularly the United
States and Pakistan, for a softer position now that the Soviets are
leaving and the Marxist regime in Kabul is expected to fall.
   ``There is room for all of us, but under no circumstances will we
accept the communists, not after what they have done,'' said Ghaus
Amer, a Hekmatyar spokesman in Islamabad, capital of Pakistan.
   Whatever their differences, the mujahedeen factions agree their
government should have friendly relations with neighbors, even the
Soviet Union, but be free of foreign interference.
   ``We have a 2,000-kilometer (1,200-mile) border with the
Russians, so of course we want good diplomatic relations,'' Karzai
said. ``There will be problems with trust, especially at the
beginning, but we will have to build those relations gradually.''
   Strong as their desire for independence may be, the Afghans will
be heavily dependent on foreign aid to rebuild after a decade of war
that reduced many cities to rubble. Much of the industry and
agriculture is idle or in ruins, and mines litter the landscape.
   One-third of the prewar population lives in the refugee camps of
Pakistan and Iran and must be repatriated. U.N. officials estimate
reconstruction and resettlement will cost more than $2 billion.
   Western diplomats in Islamabad expect most Afghans to be
preoccupied with rebuilding their lives.
   One said: ``The question of government is relevant mainly to the
political leaders'' of the mujahedeen. ``The Afghans' tradition has
been to run their affairs locally with as little interference as
possible from Kabul.''

   Authorities are investigating an extensive
Polish espionage ring that spied on the U.S. Embassy and recruited
senior Austrian security officers, authorities said Tuesday.
   They learned of the network through an officer in the Polish
intelligence service who defected to the West German
counterespionage agency, said an official at the Interior Ministry
on condition of anonymity.
   Officials said the agents included senior officers of the
Austrian state police and Polish emigres.
   The spies' targets included the West German and U.S. embassies in
Vienna as well as Polish emigres and regime critics living in
Austria, according to police sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   A prosecutor's office has begun investigations, but no charges
have been filed in the year-old inquiry, a prosecutor said.
   Some suspects won't face prosecution since several offenses date
back five years or longer and can no longer be prosecuted under
Austrian law, the prosecutor said.
   The Vienna newspaper Der Standard said a journalist and a retired
state police colonel confessed, and some of the agents had worked
for the Polish secret service for more than 15 years.

   About 80 demonstrators shut down the Golden
Gate Bridge at the height of rush hour this morning to demand faster
government action in stopping the spread of AIDS.
   The demonstrators started blocking lanes about 7:30 a.m. and
quickly succeeded in stopping traffic in both directions, said
bridge officer Lou Garcia. The fog-shrouded bridge reopened at about
8 a.m.
   Highway Patrol cars and San Francisco police were sent to clear
lanes for commuter traffic heading into the city from Marin County.
About 20 people were arrested.
   The closure snarled traffic on Highway 101, which is normally
crowded at that hour under the best of conditions. Frustrated
motorists shut off their engines and got out of their cars to see
what was going on.
   The group spread a banner across the width of the famous span and
handed out leaflets to stalled motorists.
   Garcia said it was too foggy to tell what the demonstration was
about.
   But a caller to The Associated Press bureau in San Francisco said
the protest was organized by a group called Stop AIDS Now Or Else.
   The caller, who did not identify himself, said the demonstrators
either have the fatal disease or have been deeply affected by it.
   ``About 80 people are blocking traffic in protest of the
inactivity of the government the last eight years and telling George
Bush we're not going to remain inactive,'' said the caller. ``We're
going to continue to put pressure on Washington to do more for
people with AIDS.''

<TEXT>
   Seasonal stirrings are about to lead the
nation's groundhogs from their snug burrows in search of _ lady
groundhogs.
   That's right, when the furry mammals set forth in midwinter they
couldn't care less about making weather predictions, researchers say.
   It's hormones that get them moving. Only the timing proves a boon
for small town chambers of commerce which seek publicity by taking
advantage of the appearance of the animals and the associated
ancient weather folklore.
   Feb. 2, known as Groundhog Day in the United States, has been a
time for weather prognostications for centuries. The date is also
known as Candlemas in the Christian tradition, a feast somewhat
overshadowed by the commercial hype in recent years.
   The popular idea of predicting winter's end from animal behavior
extends back at least to the ancient Celts, and was spread by the
Roman legions.
   Over the centuries farmers came to consider the celebration,
occurring about halfway between the winter solstice and the spring
equinox, a good time to try to make weather predictions, applying
the theory that the rest of winter would be the opposite of that on
Candlemas.
   ``If Candlemas be bright and clear, there'll be two winters in
the year,'' goes one traditional British rhyme. ``If Candlemas bring
clouds and rain, go winter, and come not again.''
   Similar beliefs are reported from Ireland, Scotland, France and
Spain. So serious was this taken that some German farmers were said
to have preferred to see a wolf in the stable than that Candlemas
day be pleasant and clear.
   It was the Germans who settled in Pennsylvania who brought to
America the tradition of predicting the weather on this date.
   In Europe they had looked to the first movements of hibernating
bears, hedgehogs and badgers for weather predictions. On this side
of the ocean the honor fell to the woodchuck _ also known as the
groundhog or marmot.
   Woodchucks do begin to leave hibernation at this time of year _
at least in some parts of the nation. But scientists report that
what's on the animals' minds is sex, not weather.
   The males come out of the burrows first, while female groundhogs
won't awaken for a week or more. In the meantime, the males search
for food and fight among themselves according to researchers in
Maryland and Pennsylvania.
   The folk belief, however, is that animals somehow know future
weather and, if they end their hibernation and sally forth, spring
is close.
   Thus developed the worry that a shadow might frighten the animal
back into its home, leading to a prediction of six more weeks of
winter.
   Most folks consider that bad news.
   In the more northerly areas of the country, however, some people
are said to hope that the groundhog will see its shadow _ predicting
that winter will last ``only'' six more weeks.
   The U.S. Naval Observatory, meanwhile, relays a report that
sailors who have been stationed at Guantanamo Bay say local people
in Cuba have a somewhat similar tradition.
   That is that around this date banana rats find a tree to climb
and relax in. If they settle at a low level of the tree it will be a
bad year for hurricanes, while rats climbing high in the trees means
a mild hurricane season, the belief goes.
   For the more religious, the church observations on Feb. 2 are
known as the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord and the Feast of
the Purification of Mary.
   This celebrates the time when Mary, as required by Jewish law,
went to the Temple in Jerusalem to be purified 40 days after giving
birth to a son, and to present that son, Jesus, to God.
   That presentation of Jesus, said to bring light to the world,
helped lead to the custom of blessing, on this date, the candles
destined to be used for the rest of the year. Hence, the name
Candlemas.
   And even those candles extend the weather-folklore connection,
with the superstition that a candle blessed on this date will
protect a home if lighted during a thunderstorm.

   A man accused of faking his own death in
a $1.5 million insurance fraud was arrested carrying the driver's
license of the man whose body was part of the scam, an FBI agent
said.
   Melvin Hanson, co-founder of Just Sweats, a Whitehall, Ohio-based
athletic clothing store chain, was arrested in connection with the
insurance scam at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport Sunday night by U.S.
Customs Service agents, police said Monday.
   The suspect was carrying a driver's license and other papers that
belonged to Ellis H. Greene, a former Ohio man whose body was found
in a Glendale, Calif., doctor's office and reported to be that of
Hanson, said Douglass C. Ogden, agent in charge of the Columbus FBI
office. The body later was identified as that of Greene.
   But the arrested man denied he was Hanson and plans to fight
extradition to Ohio, Ogden said.
   Hanson, 47, and his business partner, John B. Hawkins, 25, have
been sought by police in Columbus and California since mid-1988,
when it was discovered that Hanson was not dead and Hawkins had
disappeared.
   Theft charges against Hanson and Hawkins were filed Oct. 14 by
Farmers New World Life Insurance Co. of Mercer Island, Wash., which
paid Hawkins $1 million in death benefits. Hawkins was Hanson's
beneficiary.
   Police in Los Angeles and Glendale, Calif., have been
investigating Greene's death as a homicide.
   Hanson was arrested upon his return from Acapulco, where he had
gone to see a plastic surgeon, authorities said. When he was
arrested, the suspect carried identification cards under 13 names,
authorities said.
   The suspect carried no identification under the name Melvin
Hanson but scars around his eyes, apparently from plastic surgery,
convinced authorities the man they arrested was Hanson, Ogden said.
   Ogden said fingerprints taken after the suspect was arrested
would be compared today with those in Hanson's military records.
   Danny Burns, who was appointed by U.S. District Court in Fort
Worth to represent the man, said his client is not Hanson, but
Wolfgang Eugene von Snowden, as indicated on the passport he was
carrying.
   The arrested man was charged with theft by fraud on a warrant
from Ohio. U.S. Magistrate Gene Grant set bond at $5 million, and
the man was jailed.
   Hanson and Hawkins also are accused of stealing about $2 million
from Just Sweats, which they founded in 1985. Just Sweats has filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy
laws.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Reilly, designated to head the
Environmental Protection Agency, promised today aggressive and
timely enforcement of environmental laws, saying the environment can
be protected without hindering economic growth.
   Reilly's nomination by President Bush as head of the federal
government's key environmental agency is expected to win early
Senate approval. His appearance today before the Environment and
Public Works Committee prompted bipartisan praise from members.
   Sen. Quentin Burdick, R-N.D., committee chairman, called Reilly,
who is president of the World Wildlife Fund, ``a person ... who
appreciates that a great nation must be a good steward of its land,
its air, its water and its natural resources.''
   ``I'm pleased to join the chorus of admirers and welcomers,''
said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., noting that Reilly was
introduced to the panel by no fewer than five senators from three
states.
   Reilly told the senators that while he plans to enforce
environmental laws aggressively ``whenever it is warranted to
safeguard public health and environmental quality'' he also will
seek to deal with environmental problems through consensus and
cooperation.
   ``We no longer have the time or luxury of allowing the
bitterness, the polarization, the wasted resources and other
excesses'' that have marked the conflicts in recent yeas between
environmentalists and industry.
   Reilly said he has spent his career in the environmental movement
``advocating environmental protection and economic growth'' and
added that he was ``convinced we can find it.''
   Reilly ticked off a list of priority issues facing the EPA such
as finding ways to come to grips with the problems of acid rain,
depletion of the earth's ozone layer, global warming, ocean
pollution and cleaning up toxic waste dumps.
   But he said the problems posed by acid rain are ``ahead of
everything else'' and promised early EPA action to develop
legislation aimed at dealing with the issue.
   ``We expect to offer a comprehensive proposal for congressional
consideration as soon as possible'' aimed at achieving a
``substantial reduction of acid rain by the end of the century,''
Reilly said.
   Several senators noted Reilly's desire to deal with environmental
issues through consensus and expressed concern that the approach
might lead to inaction on part of the EPA.
   ``Will you conciliate, mediate, negotiate away our environmental
laws?'' asked Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who nevertheless expressed
support for Reilly's nomination.
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., urged Reilly to be ``an
environmental advocate'' in the Bush administration and allow the
EPA not to be a ``reluctant combatant as it often has been'' in the
Reagan administration.
   ``You can count on me being an advocate,'' replied Reilly.

   A lone hijacker seized control today
of a Colombian airliner with 116 passengers aboard, authorities
said, and surrendered after diverting the plane to Costa Rica.
   The Ace airline Boeing 727 was commandeered at about 11 a.m.
after taking off from San Andres Island, Colombia, en route to the
city of Medellin, the Civil Aeronautics Department of Colombia said.
   ``The hijacker during the flight told the pilot, Jaime Perez, he
would burn a passenger alive if he did not divert the flight to
Costa Rica,'' said Costa Rican air traffic controller Carlos
Paniagua.
   Radio Reloj, a Costa Rican radio station, said it received an
anonymous telephone call saying the hijacker was seeking the freedom
of an American and several Colombians under arrest in Costa Rica on
drug charges.
   Public Security Director Hernan Garron said the hijacker turned
himself in after the plane landed in Costa Rica at about noon.
   A Costa Rican anti-terrorist squad and Red Cross personnel went
aboard the plane, according to control tower officials at the
airport north of the Costa Rican capital.
   Some passengers were taken to an airport lounge for treatment for
shock, Garron said.
   Garron said the hijacker apparently acted alone.
   Officials in Colombia said the plane carried 116 passengers and
six crew members.

   Staffers of the National Park Service at
Yellowstone National Park were ``determined to maintain the natural
fire regime'' as fires grew out of control there last summer,
according to a memo by a park service official visiting from another
park.
   The memo by Sequoyia National Park fire specialist Howard Nichols
said Yellowstone staffers ``were bemoaning the fact that new (fire)
starts, as mandated by the secretary'' had to be suppressed,
according to a copy of the memo made public today at a congressional
hearing on the fires.
   The Aug. 15 memo was submitted by Nichols to the western regional
director after a week-long visit to Yellowstone that began July 28.
On July 21, then-Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel ordered that
what some have called the ``let it burn'' policy be suspended and
all fires fought.
   Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont., submitted the memorandum at a joint
hearing of the national parks subcommittee of the House Interior
Committee and the forests subcommittee of the House Agriculture
Committee.
   Nichols did not say that anyone disobeyed Hodel's order. But
Marlenee suggested to Denis Galvin, deputy director of the National
Park Service, that the memo showed that Hodel's policy ``was not
being carried out.''
   Galvin said the service would ``absolutely'' look into points
raised by the memo.
   Among other things, Nichols said, ``The tactics used for these
fires may well result in the suggestion that Yellowstone was using
suppression dollars to achieve natural resource benefits, a patently
illegal use of these funds.''
   Also, he said, Yellowstone's pre-existing fire plan ``was
deficient in not stating how many acres should be permitted to burn
at any time.''
   Marlenee and other members of Congress from the Yellowstone area
have protested that the park service endangered their constituents'
businesses and property in neglecting to fight the fires until they
were too far gone for effective suppression.
   The park service and environmental groups supporting it argue
that fire is necessary to regenerate the high lodgepole pine forests
of Yellowstone, and only the unforeseeable and exceptional drought
made 1988's fires so devastating to normal tourist and other
activity.

<HEAD>Air Transport Group Urges Delay Of New Denver Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful airline industry group has urged further
study before construction begins on Denver's proposed new $3 billion
airport.
   The Air Transport Association, which represents most major U.S.
airlines, including Denver's two largest carriers, opposes the
city's plan to break ground on the new airport this summer.
   It will voice that position during public hearings in Denver this
week. The new airport is planned about 20 miles farther out of the
city than Stapleton International Airport, located on the city's
eastern outskirts.
   ``This airport isn't needed right now,'' Leslie Rowland, a
spokeswoman for the Washington-based association, said Monday.
``We've already got a lot of unused capacity right now. This needs
further evaluation.''
   The group hasn't decided what an appropriate timetable should be,
she said.
   Rowland said the association decided last week to participate in
Denver's public hearings, partly on the advice of Continental and
United airlines. Both carriers argue that Denver is planning the new
airport too quickly, and both are represented on the transport
association's executive committee.
   Mayor Federico Pena and Gov. Roy Romer say a new airport is
needed because Stapleton, among the nation's busiest airports, can't
handle its traffic volume. Critics of the new aiport say Stapleton's
volume has fallen off somewhat in the past year and that Stapleton
should be expanded rather than building at a new site.
   The Federal Aviation Administration supports the airport plan,
said FAA spokesman John Leyden.

<HEAD>Housing Affordability Measure Down Slightly in December</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An index measuring the ability of the typical
American family to buy a home edged down in December, leaving buyers
with slightly less purchasing power than they had a month earlier, a
real estate trade group said Tuesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said its affordability index
was 112.3 in December, down from 112.8 in November.
   The December figure means that a family earning the median income
of $32,100 had 12.3 percent more income than needed to qualify for a
mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of a
median-priced home.
   For all of 1988, the index was 113.4, down slightly from 113.8 in
the previous year, as family incomes mostly keep pace with increases
in mortgage interest rates and home prices.
   The median price of an existing home in December fell $300 from
the previous month to $87,700, meaning half the homes sold for more
and half for less. Median family income rose $104 and the mortgage
rate used to calculate the index rose from 9.48 percent to 9.61
percent, representing a composite of fixed and adjustable rates.
   The affordability index, which has been above 100 since June
1986, was at its highest point for 1988 in April, when it reached
113.8.

   Author Fernando Namora, one of Portugal's
best-known novelists, died Tuesday after a 50-year literary career.
He was 69.
   Namora, who was proposed for the Nobel Prize in 1981, was an
instigator of the neo-realist spirit in Portuguese literature that
tried to capture the texture of rural life in the 1940s.
   He was born in the central Portuguese town of Condeixa in 1919,
studied medicine in Lisbon and became a doctor serving remote
mountain locations.
   His experiences of the rough life of the mountain people in
Portugal's Serra de Estrela region formed the basis for his early
novels, including ``Mountain Doctor,'' which was translated into
many languages.
   Namora wrote more than 30 books and several volumes of poetry.
   In 1988, President Mario Soares awarded Namora the Order of Henry
the Navigator, Portugal's highest civilian honor.

<HEAD>Bush Pledges to `Wring' Waste out of Military Procurement System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush pledged Tuesday to ``wring the
last drop of waste and mismanagement'' out of the scandal-scarred
military procurement system and said that cost overruns hurt the
national security.
   Standing on the sun-splashed deck of the aircraft carrier
America, Bush delivered his message in a speech to thousands of
sailors at the Norfolk Naval Base and Air Station, the largest naval
installation in the country. A number of representatives of defense
contractors also were in the audience.
   Still fighting off a cold, Bush had a raspy voice and coughed
repeatedly during his remarks. He said later he had been ``just
croaking away'' and wasn't sure during his speech that he would be
able to finish.
   It was his first out-of-town trip since becoming president, and
his speech came against the backdrop of a fraud and bribery scandal
in the military procurement system.
   Bush said he believed that the overwhelming majority of
procurement officers and defense contractors care about the quality
of the ships, planes and weapons that they sell to the Pentagon. ``I
am determined to make sure that every single one of them does,'' he
said.
   The president said that cost overruns are not a new problem but
``they are still wrong and hurt the national security, particularly
when budgets are tight.
   ``We want tighter controls and higher standards in weapons
procurement, and we will get tighter controls and higher standards
in weapons procurement,'' he said.
   Saying he will insure that the military has the proper support
from the country, Bush said, ``I firmly believe that the vital first
step to broadening our national consensus on defense is to wring the
last drop of waste and mismanagement out of the way we buy our
weapons. And that's what we intend to do.''
   Bush flew by helicopter from Washington and landed directly on
the deck of the carrier. A staff helicopter that landed first sent a
gust of wind across the deck that nearly blew away the red carpet
taped down for the president. It was rolled up and then laid out
again once Bush landed.
   As part of security precautions, Bush's armored limousine was put
on the ship's deck. It rode alongside him as he walked.
   Bush did not wear an overcoat in the mild weather _ the
temperature was in the 50s _ although the sailors and many members
of the audience wore jackets and coats to ward off the chill of the
wind. Bush, who came down with a cold late last week, said he was
feeling better.
   Despite his cold, Bush seemed in good spirits. After his remarks,
he ate lunch in a mess hall with enlisted sailors, dining on egg
drop soup, Cantonese meat sticks, pork-fried rice, a spring roll,
shrimp and a glass of milk.
   He asked if the chow was ``show business food'' or if the sailors
always ate as well. They said they generally ate pretty well.
   ``You want a little Trivial Pursuit?'' he asked a sailor. He said
he had been stationed at nearby Oceana Naval Air Station ``a
thousand years ago'' as World War II was coming to an end.
   ``I had just gotten orders to go back overseas,'' he recalled.
``Thank God, the war ended.''
   Introducing Bush to the audience, Vice Adm. Richard Dunleavy, the
air commander of the Atlantic Fleet, told Bush ``you're back to your
roots'' and proclaimed a homecoming.
   Bush was a naval combat fighter in World War II and recalled some
of his experiences.
   Saying he would demand high standards from defense contractors,
Bush said, ``I've been inside a submerged submarine while depth
charges were going off all around it. And I know what it's like to
hear the vessel strain and shake and pray to God that the people in
charge of buying and building cared as much about the vessel as you
do.''
   Bush spent weeks aboard a submarine during the war after he was
rescued as sea when his plane was shot down.

<HEAD>1989-90 Budget Calls for Billion Dollar Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres on Tuesday
introduced a $30.7 billion budget for the 1990 fiscal year with a $1
billion deficit that was bigger than expected.
   The document presented to the Knesset, or parliament, calls for a
19 percent increase in the government's operating budget to be
partly offset by a reduction in the development budget and increases
in taxes and fees.
   Defense outlays are to rise to $5.9 billion in the fiscal year
beginning April 1, from $5.05 billion in the current year.
   Part of the rise in military spending is to cover increased costs
for countering the 14-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Dealing with the Arab revolt has been
costing the government about $14 million a month.
   The budget is expected to win easy approval in parliament, where
a coalition between Peres' Labor Party and Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's Likud bloc controls four-fifths of the seats. But tax
increases and cuts in food subsidies have already brought an angry
public response.
   Peres has pledged to hold down federal spending. In announcing
his economic austerity program on Jan. 1, he said the aim was to try
to hold this year's deficit to the same level as last year's $833
million in red ink.
   He did not explain Tuesday why the goal was not attained, but he
told parliament that ``We have learned that nothing feeds inflation
more than a budget deficit. ... Therefore, we decided to cut the
expected budget deficit.''
   The nation's massive Histadrut labor federation, which represents
about 80 percent of Israeli workers, has pledged to oppose Peres'
plan, contending it will increase unemployment and significantly
raise food, transport and insurance costs that workers can't afford.
   An announced earlier, the budget calls for reducing government
subsidies for food and public transport. Fees for universities,
hospitals and insurance are to increase, and new taxes will be
imposed on cars and imported services.
   Israeli TV estimated up to 4,000 government workers could lose
their jobs under the austerity program.
   The Israeli economy grew a sluggish 1 percent last year, down
sharply from 5.2 percent growth in 1987. About half of the slowdown
has been blamed on the uprising, which has reduced tourism, business
investment and sales to the territories.

<HEAD>Ugandan President Says Libya Too Small To Be Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni said Tuesday
that Libya was too small a country to present a threat to other
states, ``but if they do, we'll kick them out.''
   Museveni, speaking at a National Press Club meeting with
reporters, also said that although the United States has accused
Libya of supporting terrorism, the Libyans have denied the charge.
``So we don't know what to think,'' he said.
   ``Libya has no power to destabilize anyone. They're just 3
million people,'' said Museveni, who is on a private visit here to
promote his country to business leaders and journalists. ``If they
do,'' he added, his government will ``kick them out.''
   Libya, as well as North Korea, provides Uganda with weapons and
military advisers. Uganda also got some $8 billion in 1988 from the
United States for development projects.
   U.S. officials are pleased with Museveni's three-year rule,
saying he is the best leader his country has had in recent years.
   Museveni came to power in 1986 after waging guerrilla warfare
against the governments of Idi Amin and Milton Obote. Museveni had
accused both men of bankrupting Uganda in pursuit of personal power
and wealth.
   The annual State Department report on human rights around the
world, which is to be published this month, praises Uganda for
progress it has made in offering amnesty to resistance groups and
allowing a free press, but also criticizes long jail periods without
trial and a slow judicial process, U.S. officials say.

<TEXT>
   The main organization of Moslem
guerrillas fighting communist forces in Afghanistan is the
seven-party Islamic Unity of Afghan Mujahedeen, the major recipient
of military aid from the United States, Pakistan, China and Saudi
Arabia. Its component groups are:
   _ Hezb-i-Islami, led by the ambitious Gulbaddin Hekmatyar. It is
a hardline Islamic revolutionary group reputed to have received the
most money and arms from abroad.
   _ Hezb-i-Islami, led by the elderly Yunis Khalis. It split from
Hekmatyar's group in the early 1980s mainly due to a personality
clash with Hekmatyar's faction, but it shares the same fervent
ideology.
   _ Jamiat-i-Islami, led by Burhanuddin Rabbani. It is reputed to
be the most effective militarily and it boasts the mujahedeen's most
famous commander, Ahmad Shah Masood. It is thoroughly Islamic, but
less hard-line than the Hekmatyar and Khalis groups.
   _ Ittehad-i-Islami, led by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf. It is the weakest
of the hard-line groups but one of its top officers, Ahmad Shah, was
designated by the alliance in 1988 to head a provisional mujahedeen
government that never fully materialized.
   _ Harakat-e-Inqilab-i-Islami, led by Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi. It
began as the broadest-based insurgent group with a large following,
mixing hard-line elements with urban intellectuals, but has shrunk
because of a lack of central organization.
   _ National Islamic Front of Afghanistan, led by Syed Ahmad
Gailani. It has a traditional, family-oriented following with
democratic, nationalist views. Gailani is often at odds with the
hard-liners, especially Hekmatyar.
   _ Afghan National Liberation Front, led by Sibghatullah
Mojaddidi, current rotating chairman of the mujahedeen alliance. It
has moderate views similar to those of the National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan. Mojaddidi has a strong personal following but the party
has never received the external support to be effective militarily.

<HEAD>Radio Pioneer Pegeen Fitzgerald Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends mourning the death of Pegeen Fitzgerald
recalled how she and her husband, partners in a groundbreaking radio
format, wove their way into the hearts of ardent listeners from
Eleanor Roosevelt to average New Yorkers.
   ``If you listened to them, it seemed like you were eavesdropping
on a conversation with a loving but not always an agreeing couple,''
said radio host John A. Gambling, who worked with Mrs. Fitzgerald
and her husband, Edward, at WOR-AM.
   Mrs. Fitzgerald, 78, died of breast cancer Monday in her
apartment, said Roger Garner, a personal assistant. It was from that
apartment that the Fitzgeralds most often broadcast their unscripted
show _ a program which featured discussions of the couple's everyday
life, their friends and current events.
   ``They got mad at each other on the air. They celebrated things
on the air,'' said Kathy Novak, a television producer who
apprenticed with the Fitzgeralds. ``Pegeen always said, `We don't
read from any scripts.'''
   The show, which first aired in 1937, ended with the death of
Edward in 1982. Mrs. Fitzgerald continued on WOR for another year
before moving to public radio station WNYC, where she was on the air
until last spring.
   The Fitzgeralds' program was the first of its kind, and quickly
inspired an assortment of imitators.
   The monthly bills could provide a show's worth of material. As
the couple chatted, the sounds of their many pet cats or their
cleaning woman running the vacuum could be heard in the background.
Their only preparation for the program was a cursory reading of the
newspapers and listeners' mail.
   The couple's on-air arguments were the result of honest anger;
Edward once became so upset during one breakfast show that he
returned to bed and left his wife alone to finish the show.
   ``We're a true soap opera,'' she once remarked to a reporter.
   Mrs. Fitzgerald first took to the airwaves when employees of a
department store where she worked had to fill the air time of a
store-owned radio station.
   In 1937, a WOR-AM executive offered to put a microphone in her
office at the store and she soon was doing a half-hour show during
her lunch hour.
   When she caught pneumonia, management asked if she could go on
air from her hospital bed and later from her home while she was
convalescing.
   Because she did not want her announcer, Henry Morgan, to see her
in a bathrobe, she asked if her husband could take his place. The
husband-wife combination became a radio first, and First Lady
Eleanor Roosevelt once went to their apartment to watch.
   Ardent listeners protested vigorously whenever station executives
tried to remove the Fitzgeralds from the airwaves. The listeners
were so devoted to the couple that several willed their pets to the
animal-loving couple.
   Mrs. Fitzgerald was survived by four sisters and one brother.

<HEAD>OSHA Proposes New Protections for Electric Utility Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government proposed Tuesday to expand
safety requirements at electrical utility companies and said the
changes could prevent about one-third of the 75 work-related deaths
in the industry each year.
   The proposal by the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration would cover 660,000 employees of electric
utilities and related services, the government said.
   The regulations, subject to a public comment period before they
take effect, were drafted in cooperation with the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Edison Electric Institute,
a utility industry trade group.
   The guidelines would affect such routine tasks as using ladders
to enter manholes as well as work on exposed electric lines by
tree-trimmers and repair workers.
   OSHA said it would cost about $21 million to bring utilities in
compliance. The regulations would not cover construction and
telecommunications workers who face similar hazards. Those workers
are covered by separate standards.
   The tighter rules were proposed for electric utility workers
because they encounter far greater risk of electric shock and falls,
OSHA said in a statement. The proposal does not cover electric power
plants not run by utilities but OSHA said it was considering
extending the rules at a later date to cover all electric power
generation, transmission and distribution.
   The agency said full compliance with the regulations should
eliminate 24 to 28 of the approximately 75 work-related fatalities
each year among covered workers. More than 3,200 injuries also
should be prevented, OSHA said.
   Electric shock accounts for half the deaths and injuries in the
industry.
   To protect workers from shock, the guidelines would require wider
use of protective equipment such as insulating blankets, gloves and
sleeves. A number of training and safety measures also are included
in the proposed guidelines.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold, stiff wind rips down Town Lake as
Terry Page stands on the deck of a floating shantytown. Overhead, a
man yells from a passing car on the First Street bridge: ``Get a
job.''
   ``Right there is someone who doesn't understand the issues of the
homeless,'' said Page, who knows the problems first hand.
   Page, 29, spends many of his days and nights on the shantytown,
three scrapwood huts lashed together atop styrofoam blocks that have
been anchored in the middle of the lake that bisects downtown Austin.
   The floating eyesore _ deliberately ugly to prick the consciences
of the thousands who drive or jog by daily _ has been floating in
the lake since the end of October. It is the creation of the Street
People's Advisory Council, or SPAC, an organization founded by James
Williams that has performed similar publicity stunts to increase
awareness of the homeless.
   Last year, SPAC members took a gosling hostage and threatened to
cook and eat it if the City Council didn't meet with them. They got
their meeting.
   Williams, 49, was briefly held by police for trespassing last
year when he and other homeless people broke into and lived for
several days in an abandoned house owned by the University of Texas.
   When the state Legislature convened in January, SPAC members
panhandled at the Capitol for quarters so they could park a couch in
a metered parking space.
   The group is now lobbying the City Council to build a permanent
tent city for the city's 2,700 homeless people. Although Austin
winters are generally mild with temperatures in the 50s, the
thermometer occasionally dips below freezing.
   ``I try to figure out something that is humorous and to the
point. A lot of people have heard the issues and have turned a deaf
ear,'' Williams said in a recent interview.
   Acting City Manager Barney Knight says Williams and his group
have been forceful. ``They've done a very effective job in keeping
their issue before the public.''
   Others who try to serve the area's down-and-out mistrust Williams
and SPAC.
   ``They are a self-appointed group serving themselves. As far as
homelessness and needing of assistance, they are phonies,'' said
Marion Morris, director of Helping Our Brothers Out, or HOBO.
   HOBO provides transitional housing for homeless people and works
with other human service agencies to get help the needy.
   ``I personally don't feel these people (SPAC members) should come
under the heading of the homeless,'' Morris said. ``They should come
under the heading of chemical abusers.
   ``A lot of these guys have been on the street most of their
lives. They would like to use the government services to sustain
them while they go about taking care of their drug habits,'' he said.
   Williams concedes some SPAC members have drug and alcohol
problems, but he said Morris misses his group's point.
   ``We're strictly a high pressure advocacy group. We're a
non-providing group; we're a referral agency'' Williams said.
   SPAC has only five people on its council, but 20 to 30 people
check in daily at its offices, said Carl Riley, sergeant-at-arms and
executive administrator.
   ``HOBO has a low outlook on street people and we don't,''
Williams said. ``I don't practice telling someone how to run their
life. We don't push re-hab on them, we don't push religion. We try
to get people into some type of housing with dignity.''
   Housing is the critical issue. ``If a person has an address and a
telephone then they can get employment,'' said Williams, originally
from Los Angeles but who has lived in Austin for the past 15 months.
``And then the next thing would be health care services.''
   Williams, Page and a man named Joe who refused to give his last
name live in the floating three-plex.
   Knight said the structure on Town Lake probably violates a city
ordinance, but added, ``We're somewhat reasonable about giving these
people a way to advertise.''
   To circumvent the ordinance, the three men have purchased a
fishing license and keep several lines in the water.
   Although short on dignity, the huts have many comforts.
   Page and Williams built shelves inside their units. They have
heaters, sleeping bags, camping stoves, lanterns, radios and an ice
chest full of food. They also have a car battery rigged up to power
a light at night. Williams has a rowboat to ferry people and
supplies from shore. All the materials to construct the boats have
been donated.
   And as a symbol, the boats have served well, Page said.
   ``That's what they're meant to be, eyesores. People ask us, what
is this for? We tell them we are protesting about low-income
housing. There's not enough of it.''

<TEXT>
   The military service exemption for
sons of Jewish victims of the Holocaust has been extended to the
grandsons of those persecuted, the defense minister said Tuesday.
   The issue of military service ``is still very sensitive'' for the
children of Holocaust survivors, Defense Minister Rupert Scholz said
in an interview with the Hamburg-based Panorama television program.
   ``The decision to extend the exemption is in keeping with a
long-standing desire for reconciliation,'' Scholz said.
   Until recently, only the sons of Holocaust victims were exempted
from West Germany's compulsory military service.
   Scholz said the decision was made at the request of the West
German Jewish Council.
   The Jewish Council made its request after a Frankfurt court ruled
against a Jewish man who asked that he be exempted because his
grandfather had been a victim of Nazi persecution.

   Eye-stinging spruce smoke cloaked

quipped.

   The Scouts' weeklong course 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle
is short on lectures and long on cold. At least four full days and
nights are spent in the wilderness 500 miles northeast of Anchorage.
   Now in its third winter, the Alaska Army National Guard school
has trained about 150 people to cope with temperatures that
consistently range in the neighborhood of 40 degrees below zero. It
hit 45 below on the last two nights of January's class, and a couple
days after the students left, Alaska's great cold wave struck with
temperatures down to 50 and 60 below zero.
   Students run the gamut from Army Special Forces troops to raw
National Guard recruits, and Alaska Adjutant General John Schaeffer
says it is not just non-Alaskans and non-natives that need the
training.
   ``The type of Eskimo we're enlisting today doesn't have the
survival skills of the older Eskimos,'' says Schaeffer, a
participant in the January class. He estimates about half of the
Guard is Eskimo or Indian.
   Because of cultural changes, natives no longer have to rely on
the skills handed down for generations, says Schaeffer, an Eskimo
from Kotzebue. ``We've got a bunch of Eskimos and Indians around
here who would have as much trouble (surviving the cold) as anyone
else.''
   Schaeffer, an experienced arctic outdoorsman, says he attended
the class to lend it some credibility and assure its permanency and
funding.
   ``We're doing what we should have been doing for years _ taking
the skills we've learned from centuries of living here and passing
them on,'' the two-star general says.
   The school was started in response to requests from National
Guard flight crews, who wanted training similar to that offered at
the Air Force's ``Cool School'' at Eielson Air Force Base near
Fairbanks.
   Maj. Jerry Finney, the U.S. Army adviser to the 5th Scout
Battalion of the 297th Infantry, got together with an Arctic Village
hunting buddy, Timothy Sam.
   Sam recruited other instructors from the nearby Gwich'in Indian
villages of Venetie and Fort Yukon, and they began showing students
what it takes to survive.
   The practical experiences of the natives are backed by scientific
data from Finney about human physiology and thermodynamics.
   Finney says one of the most difficult survival obstacles is to
overcome the macho approach to the cold. Too often, soldiers are
afraid to admit they are freezing, he says.
   At 40 below zero, severe frostbite can occur within two to four
hours as the result of a series of minor errors or less than an hour
from one serious mistake, Finney says.
   The worst injury in the six previous classes at Arctic Village
involved a Special Forces sergeant who suffered serious frostbite to
nine toes. Part of the cause was an experimental boot, but much of
it was a stubborn unwillingness to acknowledge the cold, Finney says.
   ``Nobody knows better than you if you're cold,'' Finney preaches.
``If you're cold, do something about it. Deal with it.''
   Shelter construction is one of the areas of major emphasis at the
school. Types of shelters depend on the materials at hand, and the
foothills of the Brooks Range near Arctic Village have plentiful
supplies of stunted black spruce.
   Boughs are used for ground insulation and to thatch the sides and
roofs of lean-tos. Limbless trunks become the framework for the
shelters. Wood is gathered for all-night fires.
   Instructors show students how to snare hares and catch fish to
supplement their diet. But this part of Alaska doesn't support a
bunny population large enough to feed two dozen hungry troops.
Ice-fishing is somewhat more productive.
   Ideally, a caribou would be killed, and instructors detail the
many uses for the meat, hide and entrails. The Gwich'in have
survived on caribou for centuries.
   But this January, the nearest caribou were 80 miles away.

   Actor Tommy Lee Jones insisted on doing his
own stunt work during the 16-week production of the CBS miniseries
``Lonesome Dove,'' much to the producer's distress.
   The four-part show, which starts Sunday, focuses on a 2,500-mile
cattle drive. Jones plays the drive leader, Captain Call, in the
production based on Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.
   In the Feb. 4 issue of TV Guide, producer Dyson Lovell said he
feared Jones would get hurt atop a bucking horse, even though the
native Texan raises cattle and horses on his ranch.
   But Jones told Lovell he wanted to ride.
   ``If I don't, you get half a performance,'' he told the producer.
   ``Silver Spoon'' star Ricky Schroder, who at 18 is appearing in
his first adult role, said he spent three weeks in Texas learning

   Dimitra Liani, the girlfriend of Premier
Andreas Papandreou, says she longs for the moment when Greeks will
accept her.
   Ms. Liani, 34, has come under heavy criticism from Greek
politicians and newspapers since she began appearing in public with
the 69-year-old Papandreou three months ago and he announced he
would divorce his wife.
   ``I believe that at some point the Greek people, with their sense
of justice, won't stick by this picture that they have of me,'' said
the tall, blond former stewardess in her first interview, published
in the latest Greek edition of the French magazine Marie Claire.
   Newspapers daily ridicule the premier's relationship with the
twice-divorced Ms. Liani, while there is a growing feeling among
Greeks that the love affair is making them look ridiculous abroad.
   Papandreou announced in October he intended to end his 37-year
marriage to his American-born wife, Margaret. The former Margaret
Chant of Elmhurst, Ill., married Papandreou in 1951 when he was a
junior economics professor at the University of Minnesota.

<TEXT>
   A man accused in a scheme to produce $22
million worth of poor-quality counterfeit money pleaded guilty to
two counterfeiting charges.
   Julio Antonio Marmol, 41, of Santa Ana, entered the pleas Monday
in U.S. District Court as part of an agreement with prosecutors.
Judge J. Spencer Letts set bail at $500,000 and scheduled sentencing
for April 10.
   Marmol pleaded guilty to one count of possessing $7,700 in
counterfeit money and one count of possessing photographic plates
for counterfeiting. Each charge carries a maximum prison term of 15
years and a $250,000 fine.
   In exchange for the pleas, the U.S. attorney's office dropped
three counts of possessing counterfeit money.
   Marmol, a restaurateur, veterinarian and newspaper delivery man,
was arrested in September when Secret Service investigators seized
$22 million in counterfeit $100 bills at his home, along with
printing plates, photographic negatives and other equipment. The
printing press was not found.
   ``The quality of the paper was far inferior to genuine
currency,'' said Richard J. Griffin, chief of the Los Angeles Secret
Service office. ``Genuine currency has red and blue fibers right in
the paper and there was no attempt to even simulate those fibers.
The overall quality of the printing just wasn't there.''
   The counterfeiting plan was uncovered when a couple tried to
spend two of the bills at a department store and a clerk spotted the
money as fake. The couple cooperated with the Secret Service.

   Exiled King Michael of Romania on Tuesday accused
his homeland's communist government of ``an unhindered rule of
terror'' and asked for an urgent U.N. inquiry into human rights
there.
   In a message to the 43-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission, the
king said such an investigation should be granted priority because
``at stake is the survival of 23 million people forced to applaud a
regime that starves them, humiliates them, and destroys their cities
and villages.''
   ``Such infamy is possible only because the Romanians have been
deprived of all their rights, even the most elementary ones,
allowing an unhindered rule by terror,'' the message said.
   The king has condemned President Nicolae Ceausescu's plans for
``consolidating'' rural settlements. Critics say the plan would
involve razing thousands of villages.
   King Michael, 67, went into exile in 1948 and lives near Geneva.

   The jet carrying the U.S. Embassy staff
out of Kabul on Tuesday narrowly missed hitting a Soviet transport
plane approaching the besieged capital of Afghanistan, the two
senior American diplomats said.
   ``We had a near-collision 10 minutes after takeoff with an
incoming flight from the north,'' Charge d'Affaires Jon Glassman
said after the chartered Indian Airlines Boeing 737 arrived in New
Delhi.
   ``Air traffic control at Kabul is never very good,'' said Jim
Schumaker, second-ranking diplomat at the Kabul embassy, which
closed Monday.
   He said the plane carrying the last 11 Kabul staff members came
within a mile of a collision with the Soviet Ilyushin-76 transport.
   Both men praised pilot R.C. Maulay for his quick and expert
evasive action.
   ``We drank a champagne toast after crossing the Afghan border,''
Schumaker said.
   Maulay is a veteran of flights in an out of the Kabul airport,
which requires precipitous corkscrew landings and takeoffs.
   The airport sits on the Kabul plain, which is turned into a
geological bowl by surrounding hills and mountains. Planes routinely
drop flares designed to divert heat-seeking missiles fired by Moslem
guerrillas camped in the heights around the city.
   In closing the embassy, the United States cited fears of
deteriorating security after all Red Army soldiers leave.
   Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to
help the Marxist government fight Moslem guerrillas. All are to be
gone by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated withdrawal agreement.
   Other Western nations also are closing their embassies. West
Germany removed its remaining staff members last Saturday.
   The last U.S. Embassy personnel to leave were Glassman,
Schumaker, five other members of the U.S. Foreign Service staffers
and four U.S. Marine guards.
   Maulay, the pilot, modestly did not mention the near-collision.
   He said the chartered jet carried 8 tons of cargo on the two-hour
flight from Kabul to to Delhi.
   John R. Hubbard, U.S. ambassador to India, and his deputy, Grant
Smith, greeted the Americans, who smiled broadly and carried their
luggage to limousines and vans. Two large embassy trucks loaded the
rest of the gear.
   The New Delhi embassy issued a statement saying most would return
to the United States soon.
   Most non-communist nations, including the United States, removed
their ambassadors from Kabul in protest after Soviet troops arrived.
The withdrawal also constituted a diplomatic snub and refusal to
recognize a succession of governments put in power by assassination
and party purges.

<HEAD>Man Who Took Pizza Workers Hostage Believed Upset Over `Noid' Commercials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMBLEE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man named Noid who held two pizza
employees hostage for five hours at gunpoint was angry over the
pizza chain's ``Avoid the Noid'' commercials, the man's uncle said
Tuesday.
   Kenneth Lamar Noid, 22, was arrested Monday after the five-hour
standoff at a Domino's pizza store ended with the hostages' escape.
   He was being held Tuesday on $250,000 bond in the DeKalb County
jail pending a Feb. 17 hearing on two counts of kidnapping, two
counts of aggravated assault and theft by extortion.
   Noid had expressed anger to his mother, Julia, about the
commercials, ``but I guess she didn't think it would rise to this,''
his uncle, David Noid, said.
   Domino's national television advertising campaign features the
``Noid,'' a red-hatted gremlin who tries to foil Domino's pizza
deliveries but always fails.
   Chamblee Police Chief Reed Miller said Kenneth Noid told police
that he thinks Tom S. Monaghan, owner of the Detroit-based pizza
chain and the Detroit Tigers baseball club, ``comes in his apartment
and looks around.''
   Investigators believe Noid was ``having an ongoing feud in his
mind with Monaghan about the `Noid' commercials,'' said Sgt. Mark
Bender, a Chamblee police detective. ``Apparently, he thinks they're
aimed at him.''
   Police said Noid, armed with a .357-caliber Magnum, entered the
suburban Atlanta store Monday and made one of the employees call
Chamblee police to tell them he had taken hostages and to stay clear
of the area.
   When police arrived, Noid fired four warning shots into the
ceiling of the store, Capt. Dave M. Perkins said. Police did not
return the fire.
   Noid demanded $100,000, a getaway car and a science fiction book
titled ``The Widow's Son,'' police said. He also ordered and ate a
pizza.
   The two employees, Sean Burnsed, 22, and Darrell L. Wilson, 25,
escaped unharmed while Noid's back was turned. Noid gave up minutes
later, police said.

   The government will still accept refugees
who fled after September's military coup, even though the deadline
for return under a repatriation program expired, a government
spokesman said Tuesday.
   The spokesman, Kyaw Sann, said 2,313 students and others who fled
had already returned from border areas.
   The government estimated that 3,000 people fled to the
Thai-Burmese border and other frontier areas after the Sept. 18 coup
and shootings of hundreds of anti-government demonstrators. The
guerrillas put the number of refugees at more than 5,000.
   Sann said although the formal deadline for return would not be
extended, refugees would still be accepted at 27 government centers.
   Most of the students joined Karens and other ethnic minority
groups fighting the central government.
   Human rights groups have accused Burmese authorities of
arresting, torturing and executing some who returned. The government

<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday it has no
evidence that the suspicious deaths of two priests within 10 days
were politically provoked.
   ``There is no ground to suppose that there is someone going
around Poland and spreading death among priests,'' government
spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference.
   Authorities performed an autopsy Tuesday on the body of the Rev.
Stanislaw Suchowolec, 31, a pro-Solidarity priest found dead Monday
after a fire swept his apartment in the northeastern city of
Bialystok, 119 miles northeast of Warsaw.
   Urban said an investigation is continuing into the death of
another priest, the Rev. Stefan Niedzielak, 74, who died of a broken
neck on Jan. 21. Niedzielak was sympathetic to the Solidarity
movement.
   ``There is no evidence to assume or suppose the existence of a
political provocation'' in the deaths, Urban said.
   The Rev. Cezary Potocki, chancellor of Bialystok district, said
Roman Catholic Church officials attended the autopsy of Suchowolec,
who worked in the parish of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
   Suchowolec died apparently from smoke inhalation, according to
results of an initial investigation by the local prosecutor and
church officials, Urban said. The cause of the fire still is unknown.
   A housekeeper sounded the alarm after smelling smoke early Monday
morning, Urban said.
   ``The doors which were closed from the inside were forced open.
There was a considerable amount of smoke in the room. Father
Suchowolec was lying next to the couch. His dead dog was lying there
too,'' he said.
   ``The windows in the room were shut. The window and door panes
were blackened with soot. Maybe the electric circuits were cut off,
which could have been the source (of the fire),'' said Urban.
   Suchowolec actively supported the banned trade union Solidarity.
   Early in his six years as a priest, he served for three years as
vicar in Suchowola, home village of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, who
was murdered by security police in 1984.
   Suchowolec had organized pilgrimages to Popieluszko's gravesite
in Warsaw.
   Zofia Romaszewska, of the Solidarity Commission on Intervention
and Law Abidance, said Suchowolec had informed the commission that
he had been assaulted and that his car had been tampered with at
least twice.
   Zbigniew Romaszewski, another member of the commission which
records human rights' violations, said Suchowolec's car had been
stoned Aug. 4, 1988, and two days later his parents' apartment was
burned.
   Romaszewski said the incidents were fully documented, but Urban
said no threats were reported to investigative authorities.
   Chancellor Zdzislaw Krol of the church's Warsaw district said
Niedzielak had received anonymous threats before his death, but the
chancellor had not taken them seriously at the time. Niedzielak
maintained a shrine to Poles killed in the Soviet Union during World
War II.
   More than 5,000 people attended his funeral in Warsaw.

   A man who claimed to be an astronaut sported
impressive medals, uniforms and badges and even wangled a 10-minute
audience with the lord mayor of Dublin.
   But Robert Hunt, 27, was grounded Monday when he was arraigned on
charges of larceny and fraud and ordered held on $100,000 bail. He
was charged with duping a youth into joining the Navy and then
claiming he could get him released from his commitment for $2,000.
   Hunt claimed to be a Marine captain, a decorated fighter pilot
and told convincing but false stories about himself to his wife, his
in-laws, some people at the Bedford Veterans Administration
Hospital, an Aer Lingus pilot and cadets at the U.S. Naval Academy
in Annapolis, Md., according to state Trooper Andy Palombo, a state
police investigator.
   Palombo said he started looking into the stories earlier this
month. ``I did some checking and found out there was no such animal
as Robert Hunt who was a Marine captain and fighter pilot or
astronaut,'' he said.
   The charges against the man stem from allegations he persuaded an
18-year-old Saugus youth to enlist in the Navy and then told the
teen-ager's parents their son could get out of his commitment for
$2,000, Palombo said. They paid him that amount twice; once in a
check he said was no good and then in cash, though he later cashed
the check, Palombo said.
   Last summer the man married a woman who, like her parents, was
convinced that he was an astronaut. The man showed them burned
kitchen tiles he claimed came from the explosion of the Challenger
space shuttle three years ago.
   ``When I arrested him Saturday noon at his home, his wife still
thought he was an astronaut,'' Palombo said.
   The charges against Hunt also include his alleged use of his
wife's credit card for a variety of charges, including the charter
of a private jet to Montreal.
   He later wrote the crew complimenting them on their performance.
   ``Being a former astronaut, I would like to make note that the
landing in Montreal was equal to our landing of the shuttle
Atlantis,'' the letter stated.
   Before he flew with his wife to Ireland just before Christmas, he
called ahead to tell officials in Ireland he was an astronaut,
Palombo said.
   ``He was given a big state welcome and made an honorary citizen
of Ireland by Lord Mayor of Dublin Benjamin Briscoe because he was
an astronaut,'' according to Palombo.
   But Briscoe's spokeswoman, who requested anonymity, said Briscoe
gave Hunt a 10-minute audience on Oct. 8 at Mansion House, his
official headquarters, after being told Hunt was a visiting
astronaut.
   A source close to Briscoe, also requesting anonymity, said Hunt
told him British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was arranging for
him to be married in Westminster Abbey in London. Briscoe quickly
realized the man was ``not the full shilling,'' but politely went
along with the charade, the source said.
   ``He's very good,'' the trooper said. ``I had him in the cruiser
and I asked him one question. He talked for 10 minutes, without
hesitating, from Medford to Boston.
   ``I said to him, `But you never answered my question,' and he
said, `That's right.'''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said Tuesday he
would work to restore public faith in his government, which has been
shaken by a major financial scandal.
   Speaking to members of his Liberal Democratic Party hours before
leaving on a weeklong U.S. trip, he said ``political reform is my
top priority.''
   ``No matter how difficult, I will restore the people's trust in
government and earnestly work toward political reform,'' Takeshita
said. ``I will thoroughly enforce discipline in my administration
and bring back public faith in it.''
   For the last six months, Japanese politics has been rocked by
disclosures that top politicians or their aides profited from shares
in a real estate development firm because they bought them before
public trading. When the sales went public, the shares soared in
value.
   The purchases of shares in the firm, a subsidiary of the
information conglomerate Recruit Co., were not illegal but raised
questions of political ethics, fund-raising and influence-peddling.
   Three of Takeshita's Cabinet ministers have resigned in the last
three months because they received political donations from Recruit
or were linked to purchase of the shares.
   ``In the wake of the Recruit problem, we have been subject to
severe criticism over political ethics,'' Takeshita said in his
speech to the conservative party, which he addressed in his capacity
as its president. ``Political reform should be the basis for all
reform.''
   He said he had assembled an advisory group on political reform
that has begun drawing up concrete measures to deal with the problem.
   The political opposition calls the Recruit affair proof of
corruption in the governing party, although a few opposition
politicians have also been implicated. The opposition has demanded
that the entire Cabinet step down and Takeshita call new elections,
but he has refused.
   In an editorial last week, the newspaper Asahi Shimbun said the
scandal had damaged the image of politicians.
   ``It does nothing but deepen the nation's political discredit,''
the Asahi said. ``Takeshita must make clear to the people how he
will put an end to such a shameful political situation and take
political responsibility.''
   The Liberal Democrats have been buffeted in both electoral and
opinion polls in recent weeks.
   A recent survey by Kyodo News Service showed support for
Takeshita had plummeted from 53.4 percent in September to 35.9
percent. A poll released Saturday by the Asahi put public support at
28 percent, down from 57 percent a month earlier.
   The party also suffered a setback in elections last weekend in
Kitakyushu, western Japan, where the opposition Socialists and
Communists made slight gains in municipal balloting.
   Opposition politicians also claim a new tax package, which
introduces a general consumption tax of 3 percent and lowers
corporate and higher-bracket income taxes, was steamrolled through
Parliament and benefits the wealthy.
   Also Tuesday, Takeshita disclosed his personal assets, saying he
was worth more than $1 million.

<HEAD>FDA Panel Develops Guidelines on Dental X-rays</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Food and Drug Administration panel said
Tuesday that children with healthy teeth may need dental X-rays no
more than once every year or two, and dentally healthy adults once
every two or three years.
   The panel's guidelines, reported in the current issue of the
Journal of the American Dental Association, were prompted by concern
among some experts about the frequency of dental X-rays, both
overuse and underuse.
   ``Although the radiation risk from a dental X-ray is extremely
low, our goal is to eliminate any unneeded radiation exposure,'' FDA
Commissioner Frank E. Young said in an news release on the
guidelines Tuesday.
   ``Until these guidelines were developed, there were few concrete
criteria a dentist could use in deciding when X-rays were needed,''
he said.
   Young also stressed the flexibility of the guidelines, saying
``these are not hard and fast rules. In deciding whether an X-ray is
needed, the dentist must use clinical judgment in evaluating the
patient's needs.''
   The guidelines say children and adults generally do not need
X-rays each time they see a dentist if they are not at high risk and
show no signs of dental disease. High-risk patients include those
with enamel defects, poor dental hygiene or inadequate exposure to
fluoride, or those who come from families with poor dental health.
   The guidelines say that children visiting a dentist for the first
time will need X-rays.
   Most children who have not developed cavities and do not show any
other symptoms of dental disease will need X-rays generally once
every year or two, according to the guidelines. X-rays also are
sometimes needed to check on the proper growth and development of
permanent molars.
   The panel's guidelines are supported by the American Dental
Association, the Academy of General Dentistry, the American Academy
of Dental Radiology, the American Academy of Oral Medicine, the
American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and the American Academy of
Periodontology, the FDA said.

   The managing director of Volvo was caught
speeding in a company car and almost lost his license, police said
Tuesday.
   Police stopped Pehr Gyllenhammar while he was driving to work at
Volvo's Goteborg headquarters at 60 mph, 16 mph over the speed
limit, said Goteborg traffic chief Lars Svensson.
   Gyllenhammar was fined for the Dec. 7 incident. An average fine
for that speed is about $100. He could have lost his license if he
was caught traveling 3 mph faster, Svensson said.

   A juror hopes Joel Steinberg's manslaughter
conviction will send a message to other child abusers. But prison
sentences alone won't solve the complex problem, experts said
Tuesday.
   ``Think about what you're doing,'' juror Anne-Marie King, a
physical therapist, implored all child abusers after the verdict
Monday night.
   Steinberg will face a maximum prison term of eight and one-third
to 25 years for fatally injuring 6-year-old Lisa, his illegally
adopted daughter, on Nov. 1, 1987.
   ``It's important that these cases be prosecuted _ but I am not
sure that ... will deter anything,'' said Dr. Richard Krugman,
director of the Denver-based Kempe National Center for the
Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect.
   ``The idea that they might go to jail for it is so far from their
(abusers') thinking that it's not a very effective deterrent,''
agreed David Finkelhor, an expert in domestic violence and a
professor of family research at the University of New Hampshire.
   Instead, Krugman and others said, the trial should highlight the
urgent need for prevention.
   ``I haven't been impressed that there's been an enormous effort
to do something about prevention and treatment of abused children in
New York City _ before or after Lisa Steinberg,'' said Krugman.
   ``You could prevent 500 serious cases of abuse'' with the money
spent prosecuting Steinberg, said Krugman. ``That would be a living
memorial to her _ to have a prevention program in her name.''
   Dr. Vincent Fontana, director of the Mayor's Task Force on Child
Abuse, said the social system is riddled with problems.
   ``Child protective agencies are understaffed, overloaded and
poorly supervised. People are leaving agencies after they've been
trained because of demoralized attitudes,'' he said.
   Child abuse deaths number two to three a week in New York City
and about 4,000 to 5,000 a year nationwide, said Fontana.
   Steinberg had illegally gained custody of Lisa and a baby boy
from their unwed, teen-age mothers.
   Despite the family's supposed affluence _ Steinberg was an
attorney, now disbarred, and his companion Hedda Nussbaum was a
children's book editor _ Lisa slept on a sofa and looked
increasingly dirty and unkempt. A school photographer testified that
he used makeup and lighting tricks to camouflage bruises. Neighbors
and a teacher also noticed injuries.
   A child abuse caseworker had visited the Steinberg home in 1984.
Less than a month before Lisa's death, police found Ms. Nussbaum
with a swollen lip, but she refused to press charges.
   Ms. Nussbaum later testified for the prosecution about a 12-year
relationship in which she was beaten, brainwashed and subjected to
other bizarre punishments for transgressions imagined by a
cocaine-using Steinberg.
   Fontana charged that Ms. Nussbaum, although ``physically damaged
and perhaps mentally damaged, could have certainly saved the child''
before the abuse escalated.
   ``That doesn't excuse the school system, doesn't excuse the
police, doesn't excuse the child protective agency, doesn't excuse
the community. There were friends, relatives, neighbors who knew
what was going on and no one did anything,'' he said.
   Still, some good could emerge from the tragedy.
   State senators introduced 11 new bills Tuesday to toughen
penalties for child abuse.
   Fontana is pressing the mayor for a special agency ``that will
prioritize child abuse and neglect.'' He also suggested that
schools, hospitals and social service agencies have access to a
computerized data bank to judge whether a child is at risk.
   Meanwhile, the trial has shown that abuse occurs in all walks of
life, said Deborah Daro, director of research for the Chicago-based
National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse.
   ``Lisa Steinberg's legacy is that the middle-income people have
been able to identify with child abuse,'' echoed Fontana.
   Dr. Samuel Klagsbrun, Ms. Nussbaum's psychiatrist at Four Winds
Hospital in Katonah, said the case has made a difference in two
ways: by heightening awareness of domestic abuse and by proving that
``a severely battered woman, with significant treatment, can come
back to life. ... That's the most hopeful part for women who are
battered and watching this story.''
   ``The real question is, what shape will this experience take down
the line?'' said Klagsbrun. `` ... Will people learn something from
it _ or is it just another sensational story which disappears?
   ``I think this is such a powerful story that it won't be
forgotten.''

<HEAD>Quayle Will Meet with Salvadoran President and Rightists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle, on a mission to
encourage democracy in Latin America, will meet with El Salvador's
outgoing president and representatives of rightwing factions but not
with anyone from the leftist party battling for power in the
upcoming election, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
   Quayle's stop in San Salvador on Friday will include meetings
with President Jose Napoleon Duarte and members of his Christian
Democratic Party as well as with representatives of the rightist
Nationalist Republican Alliance, or ARENA, and ``a very diversified
group of people,'' said a senior Bush administration official.
   But Quayle will not meet with leftist presidential candidate
Guillermo Ungo or members of his Democratic Convergence Party, those
officials said.
   The officials, who briefed reporters on the condition of
anonymity, said Quayle's schedule should not be read as a sign the
administration is taking sides in the March 19 election or is
signalling any rejection of the recent truce proposal put forward by
the guerrilla coalition allied with Ungo's party.
   The explanation the officials offered for Quayle's willingness to
meet with candidates of two political parties but not the third was
that ``it would send the wrong signal at this point, given the
delicacy of the internal situation. ... We want to go down there and
see what the major parties have to say.''
   Another U.S. official knowledgeable about relations with El
Salvador said it would be awkward for Quayle to meet with a civilian
ally of rebels fighting to overthrow the U.S.-backed government.
   Quayle's three-day journey _ with a stop in Venezuela on Thursday
for the inauguration of that country's new president, Carlos Andres
Perez _ is being characterized as a chance for the vice president to
get acquainted with Latin leaders, hear their concerns on such
issues as the debt crisis and regional strife, and show U.S. support
for Latin democracies.
   One official who briefed reporters said the trip would also
bolster Quayle's statements that he will be a top adviser to Bush.
   The vice president ``will be privy to information that no one
else has right now,'' and will relay it to the president, the
official said. Bush's policies on such matters as Latin American
debt and the regional peace process are under review; Quayle is not
expected to offer major policy initiatives.
   Quayle's office has not released the names of the heads of state
with whom he will meet in Caracas, saying the plans are not yet
final.
   But a State Department official involved in planning the trip
said he is scheduled to meet with the presidents of Spain, Portugal,
Brazil, Colombia and Honduras. He will also meet with a group of
Caribbean leaders.
   One of the topics for those meetings will be the plight of the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels battling the leftist government of
Nicaragua.
   In El Salvador, the focus of discussions will be human rights.
   An administration official said Quayle intends to ``have very
good, substantive, specific conversations, very straightforward,''
to emphasize that the administration is serious about adherence to
human rights.
   Officials have expressed concern that Congress will balk at
further aid to the strife-torn nation if its government does not
reign in human rights abuses.
   Ungo's party is a political ally of the umbrella Faribundo Marti
National Liberation Front, which has been fighting the government
since 1979. On Jan. 23, the guerrillas offered for the first time to
participate in elections, but only if the ballotting is postponed
until September.
   Opinion polls have shown ARENA's candidate, Alfredo Cristiani,
leading Christian Democrat Fidel Chavez Mena, with Ungo trailing.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Tuesday
that six task forces are being created in major cities to combat
``crime in the suites'' by fighting against securities and
commodities fraud.
   ``We see every year billions of dollars of losses to investors
and in tax revenues to the federal government by reason of schemes
involving deceit, concealment and breach of trust carried out, for
example, in the securities and commodities businesses,'' Thornburgh
told reporters.
   The attorney general, flanked by U.S. attorneys from New York,
Chicago and Kansas City, announced plans to create six securities
and commodities fraud units in those cities as well as Los Angeles,
Denver, and San Francisco.
   The announcement came just weeks after disclosure that federal
investigators in Chicago had been conducting a two-year undercover
operation that has turned up widespread evidence of fraud by
commodities futures traders at the Chicago Board of Trade and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Thornburgh said 15 federal prosecutors with experience
investigating insider trading, stock manipulation and other
sophisticated financial crimes would be assigned to work exclusively
in this area along with law enforcement agents.
   The units will ``combat what can aptly be called crime in the
suites,'' Thornburgh said, ``the kind of criminal activity that's
carried out under the guise of respectability in the major financial
markets.''
   ``All of these investigations are difficult and require the
sophisticated efforts of experienced prosecutors. They are not made
by breaking down the door and seizing the evidence,'' said
Thornburgh, himself a former U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh.
   The task force idea was first pressed in 1987 by federal
prosecutors, including Rudolph Giuliani, the outgoing U.S. attorney
in New York who spearheaded the successful prosecution of insider
trading on Wall Street.
   Thornburgh hinted that the creation of task forces in Denver, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and Kansas City would result in criminal
indictments.
   ``Stay tuned,'' the attorney general told reporters.
   Selection of those cities for task forces was based on ``what the
history had been, what the pending investigation caseload was,'' he
said.
   ``The problem is bad enough that we want to undertake some extra
steps to deal with it,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``The record speaks for itself in the prosecutions that have been
undertaken ... to indicate we want to bring this additional
firepower to bear on behalf of investors who otherwise might run the
risk of being defrauded and might lose their confidence in the
integrity of these markets,'' he said.
   Thornburgh defended Chicago U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas, who has
been accused by defense attorneys of using ``strong-arm'' tactics to
pressure commodities traders into cooperating with the investigation.
   ``Mr. Valukas has kept the department fully apprised of any
significant investigations that he has undertaken and they have been
approved at the appropriate levels,'' Thornburgh said.
   The attorney general said the 15 new positions would be taken
from extra slots in U.S. attorneys offices provided for in the new
drug bill and other legislation. The experienced prosecutors would
be replaced with new hires, he said.
   Another 15 investigators and some clerical support staffers would
be assigned to the task forces, which would number between 30 and 40
people, department officials said.
   Agents from the U.S. Postal Service, the Internal Revenue
Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, would also be permanently assigned to
the task forces.

   A military tanker plane carrying 19 people
crashed today on takeoff at Dyess Air Force Base, killing at least
16 people, the Air Force said.
   The KC-135A tanker crashed in a ball of flame near the south end
of a runway, Air Force officials said. The wreckage scattered over a
wide area and still burned more than an hour after the crash.
   Airman 1st Class Lois Morrell, speaking from Dyess, said at least
16 people were killed.
   The plane's crew ``never got it off the ground,'' said Vernon
Wright, 19, who was on his way home when he saw the crash.
   ``The first thing I saw was just the mushroom of the smoke. ... I
thought was they were having a fire drill,'' he said.
   ``I heard the plane as it was coming down,'' said Skeet Jackson.
``Engines were backfiring and missing. It curved off to the left and
crashed. And then I saw the ball of smoke and fire go up.''
   The plane, assigned to K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base in Michigan,
was en route from Dyess to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii on a
training mission, said Dyess Airman 1st Class Beverly Foster.
   The KS-135, dubbed the Stratotanker, is the backbone of the Air
Force's refueling fleet. The four-engine jet, a military spin-off of
the Boeing 707, normally takes a crew of four or five but can carry
more passengers even when carrying fuel.
   A KC-135 crashed Oct. 11, 1988, at Wurtsmith Air Base near
Oscoda, Mich. The plane, also from K.I. Sawyer, crashed and burst
into flames on landing. The crash killed six and injured 10 aboard.

   Deeply split factions in Yugoslavia's
Communist Party quarreled for the second day at a key meeting
Tuesday, and the military issued new warnings that it will intervene
if the crisis continues.
   The meeting also was told that the Central Committee will discuss
demands for the ouster of national party chief Stipe Suvar, but that
the 23-member Politburo, the most powerful party body, will make a
final decision.
   Suvar took the floor to announce that if the Politburo decides to
relieve him, ``I shall accept this only as a moral reprimand because
the Central Committee alone can decide on an ideological-political
measure,'' such as dismissing him.
   His comments suggest there is disagreement even on the rules and
procedure for a possible dismissal.
   The meeting of the policy-making Central Committee, which started
Monday, is marked by a rift between liberals and conservatives over
ways to overcome the country's worst economic and political crisis.
   As opposing delegates clashed, two senior military officers
issued dramatic warnings that the armed forces would not remain idle
if the country's fortunes continue to decline.
   ``One of the biggest barriers to the stabilization of the
situation in the country is the disunity of the leaderships on all
levels,'' said Vice Adm. Stane Brovet, the deputy defense minister.
   ``Yugoslavia can survive only as a true federation, and the
forces which are striving toward the breakup of such a Yugoslavia
should be prevented primarily by political, but also by all other
means,'' Brovet said.
   The military has remained on the sidelines of recent political
conflicts between those favoring more democracy and political
pluralism and those advocating a strong, centralized communist
system to solve the country's problems.
   Senior officers show signs of increasing unease over the crisis,
which includes a 250 percent inflation rate, a sharp drop in living
standards and an alarming increase in labor and ethnic unrest.
   The political chief of the armed forces, Adm. Petar Simic, told
the meeting Monday: ``What some describe as the battle for
Yugoslavia will not be waged without the Yugoslav army.''
   Both military men have called for an end to the feuding.
   But supporters of Slobodan Milosevic, the hard-line party chief
of the Serbian republic, continued attacks on Suvar, a Croat, and
other non-Serbian federal officials whom they blame for Poland's
protracted crisis.
   Croatian Ivo Druzic sparked a sharp debate when he appealed to
Suvar and Milosevic to reconcile their differences and compromise.
   Druzic compared their clash to ``a train being pulled in opposite
directions by two locomotives.''
   Milosevic rejected this assertion without indicating any
willingness to compromise.
   Vukasin Micunovic, a Central Committee member from Montenegro,
said, ``The intolerance shown at this meeting ... is a result of the
struggle for power'' under way in the party leadership.
   Milosevic's supporters at the session criticized Suvar's opening
speech Monday, when he said the country faces a stark choice between
more democracy or ``neo-Stalinism.''
   ``Yesterday's speech, without a trace of self-criticism ... does
not offer answers to any of the key questions,'' said Serbian member
Tomislav Radovic.
   Milosevic is supported by Yugoslavia's poorer regions, which fear
that market-oriented economic reforms will cause layoffs at
loss-making, state-subsidized enterprises.
   Suvar is supported by Slovenia and his native Croatia, which
favor increased political pluralism, more democracy and radical
market-oriented reforms.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called
President Bush ``a very good and old friend'' Tuesday and said the
two have only minor differences concerning the conduct of economic
policy.
   Greenspan played down reports of a rift between the Federal
Reserve and Bush which surfaced last week after Bush said in an
interview he did not believe the central bank should be trying to
slow economic growth because of a fear of inflation.
   ``Whatever differences do exist _ and I think they are minuscule
_ have been exaggerated,'' Greenspan said during an appearance
before the congressional Joint Economic Committee.
   In an interview, Bush had cautioned the central bank against
overreacting to the threat of inflation following testimony the
previous day by Greenspan in which the Fed chairman said the risk of
higher inflation was serious enough that Fed policy should err more
on the side of ``restrictiveness than of stimulus.''
   In his comments, Bush said, ``I don't want to see us move so
strongly against fear of inflation that we impede growth.'' On
Friday, Bush said during a press conference he didn't believe the
differences between the new administration and the central bank were
that great.
   Sen. Paul Sarbannes, D-Md., said he was concerned that
disagreements between Bush and Greenspan were being aired publicly
rather than being worked out in private. He questioned Greenspan
about his access to Bush and the role he has had in making
suggestions on what should be in the budget Bush will submit to
Congress next month.
   Greenspan said he had not met with Bush since December but that
he was meeting on a regular basis with Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, Bush's top economic spokesman. Greenspan said he expects to
be consulted on the contents of Bush's budget before the president
unveils it in a joint address to Congress on Feb. 9.
   ``I have no problem communicating with President Bush. He is a
very good and old friend of mine,'' Greenspan said. ``I am not the
least bit concerned about what is going on. I think the press is
trying to make this a cause celeb where none exists.''
   Many private economists have said the new administration, which
needs robust economic growth to drive the budget deficit down, could
be on a collision course with the Fed, which since last March has
been pushing interest rates higher in an effort to slow the economy
and keep inflation from getting out of hand.
   In his comments Tuesday, Greenspan sought to minimize any
differences he might have with the new administration.
   Greenspan said the economic predictions used by the Reagan
administration to construct its final budget were optimistic but
were ``well within the range of reasonableness,'' especially if
Congress and the Bush administration agree on significant spending
cuts that will meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction targets.
Those targets call for reducing an expected $161 billion deficit
this year to $100 billion in the fiscal year which begins Oct. 1.
   Bush budget director Richard Darman has indicated the new
administration will base its own budget revisions on the optimistic
forecasts contained in the Reagan budget.
   Greenspan said that while he expects that the current economic
recovery, which has lasted a peacetime record of six years, will
some day end in a new recession, he said the imbalances that
normally preceded a downturn were not now in evidence.
   Greenspan said that rather than pushing the economy into another
downturn, he believes the Fed's efforts to boost interest rates
would extend the length of the recovery by keeping inflationary
forces under control.
   On another matter, Greepspan said the huge U.S. trade deficit,
which has shown little improvement over the past six months, would
begin improving again this year without the need for a further drop
in the value of the dollar.

<TEXT>
   The leaders of war-scarred Sudan have begun
to reshuffle their nation's Cabinet, Egypt's state-run news agency
said Tuesday.
   Sudan's State Council, which acts as a collective presidency,
decided to remove seven ministers, according to the Middle East News
Agency. It said Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi of Sudan was expected to
form a new government within 24 hours.
   The decision has not been officially announced in Sudan.
   Among those affected was Hassan Turabi, minister of justice and
head of the fundamentalist National Islamic Front. He has been at
the center of a debate over a tentative agreement for peace with
southern rebels.
   Turabi, who opposed suspending Islamic law as part of a pact with
rebels in the heavily Christian south, is expected to become foreign
minister, the Egyptian report said.
   The Democratic Unionist Party, a member of the governing
coalition in Sudan, signed the peace agreement with the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army in November. But it withdrew from the
coalition when Mahdi refused to present the agreement to the
government, apparently to avoid angering Turabi's party.
   Mahdi is now expected to select ministers from groups including
his Umma Party, the National Islamic Front, and southern parties,
according to the Egyptian report.
   Since he came to power by general elections in April 1986, Mahdi
has reshuffled his Cabinet three times.
   Sudan has been shaken by chronic food shortages. Protests over
food prices broke out in December and killed four people. The
Sudanese also suffer from severe hunger and face a $14 billion
foreign debt.

   Officials are trying to speed up
the opening of the nation's fourth oil refinery because of shortages
created by a fire at a nearby facility.
   The Jan. 24 blaze killed five people and destroyed a facility
that had been producing 60,000 barrels a day. The cause of the fire
was not known.
   Although the government diverted oil supplies from the north,
long lines formed at gasoline stations in several cities in the
heart of the oil-producing region.
   The fourth refinery, built to handle 200,000 barrels of petroleum
daily, was scheduled to open March 16.
   The government set up a task force to speed up the opening of the
new refinery.
   Aret Adams, managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corp., said replacing the destroyed refinery would cost $300
million. It was opened in 1965 by British Petroleum.
   Production from the new $850 million refinery had been scheduled
to go to overseas markets. Until the lost production capacity is
replaced, however, about half of it will be sold in Nigeria or
neighboring countries.

   Authorities arrested a South Korean deck officer in
connection with a collision of cargo ships that left seven South
Korean seamen dead and 10 missing, a prosecution official said
Tuesday.
   The 2,400-ton Semba Wang of Singapore collided with the 2,900-ton
Panamanian-registered Catherine-Rose Thursday off western Japan. The
Catherine-Rose, which was carrying a crew of 17, sunk after the
collision.
   Choi Young-kyo, a 48-year-old deck officer of the Semba Wang, is
under investigation for negligence and blocking sea traffic, said an
official at the prosecutor's office in Moji about 520 miles
southwest of Tokyo.
   None of the Semba Wang's 16 South Korean crewmen was hurt, but
the vessel suffered heavy damage.

   John F. Kennedy International Airport has become
the first airport in the country to install traffic lights on its
runways and taxiways to reduce chances of a ground collision.
   Officials said Tuesday the experimental system is working well.
   The red light-green light system initiated Jan. 15 is intended to
backstop the air traffic controllers who direct the movement of
about 500 airplanes a day on the airport's nine miles of runways and
28 miles of taxiways.
   ``So far the feedback has all been positive,'' said Jack Gartner,
manager of aeronautical services for the Port Authority at JFK.
``They (pilots) are apparently pleased to see this as a supplement
to the verbal commands when they cross the runways.''
   Similar systems are functioning at London's Heathrow and
Frankfurt's Main airports and have been recommended by the
International Civil Aviation Organization to guide airplanes and
ground equipment in bad weather.
   The $600,000 cost of the system was shared by the Federal
Aviation Administration and the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, which operates the airport.
   The system is being tested at 15 of the most critical
intersections where taxiways cross runways. In all, there are about
75 places where taxiways cross runways, Gartner said.
   The need for such a system has been underscored by the increasing
number of ground collisions at airports around the world. The worst
such collision occurred in 1977 at Tenerife on the Canary Islands
and killed 583 people.
   The traffic lights are radio controlled from the tower, said FAA
spokesman Duncan Pardue.
   In the tower, a person called the local controller instructs all
aircraft on the ground. With the new system, a second controller
monitors conversations between the local controller and the pilots
and operates the red and green lights accordingly.
   ``It will remove a chance for error where the pilot and the
controller do not understand each other, or don't communicate for
some reason, or where the pilot hears clearance for a plane that he
think is his, but isn't,'' Pardue said.
   ``Voice control will still govern, however. If the light is red,
the pilot has to ask about it,'' Pardue said.
   He said it was too early to say whether the FAA would eventually
mandate such systems as busy airports.

   With little more than 1,370 days until the next
presidential election, the Democrats have a front-runner to
challenge President Bush. According to the first 1992 campaign poll,
the leader is Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
   The mid-January ABC News survey, which an ABC polling analyst
termed ``just a fun read on what people think,'' underscored the
Massachusetts senator's standing as the most familiar name among
Democrats.
   ``As my family keeps reminding me, I've been elected president 73
times in the past 20 years in polls like this,'' quipped the senator.
   Kennedy emerged as the top 1992 presidential choice among
Democrats or independents leaning Democratic.
   ``You're kidding,'' said Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup
Organization, when told of the poll.
   ``At this point, premature understates the case by a lot,'' said
Kohut.
   Kelly Hanley, a polling analyst at ABC News, said the survey was
``just a fun read on what people think and we found Ted Kennedy at
the top, which we've found in the past never turns out to be true.''
   Kennedy is familiar with the role of early front-runner.
   In July 1985, Kennedy held a 15-point lead over Gary Hart in a
Gallup poll measuring Democrats' preferences for the 1988
presidential nomination. Kennedy remained the front-runner through
Dec. 19, 1985, the day he announced he would not run for president.
   In the new survey, Kennedy was the choice of 26 percent of people
shown a list of seven prominent Democrats and asked ``which of the
following persons do you think would be the best candidate for the
Democrats to run in 1992.''
   Ms. Hanley said the survey was done because ``we were interested
in seeing what type of support Michael Dukakis had at the moment.''
   The 1988 Democratic presidential nominee has announced he will
not seek another term as governor of Massachusetts, but has refused
to rule out a 1992 presidential run.
   The ABC poll had him tied for third place with Jesse Jackson. In
second place was Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York.
   The top four finishers in the survey were bona fide Democratic
liberals, a political species supposedly headed for the endangered
list after landslide defeats in the last three presidential
elections.
   Trailing the four leaders were Sens. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee
and Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
   ABC polled 781 people who described themselves as Democrats or
independents who lean toward favoring Democrats. They were contacted
between Jan. 12 and 16 and the results had a 4-point margin of
error, meaning they could be off as much as four percentage points
up or down.
   Kennedy was the first choice of 26 percent and Cuomo of 19
percent. Dukakis and Jackson were named by 15 percent each, while
Gore had 6 percent, Bradley 5 and Gephardt 4.
   One prominent Democrat not included on the ABC list was Texas
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen who received highly favorable reviews as the
party's vice presidential candidate in 1988.

   Natan Sharansky, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
choice to represent Israel at the United Nations, is a short,
balding man who spent nine years in Soviet prisons but seems never
to lose his sense of humor.
   ``I will say only what I want to say. I have enough experience
with interrogations and I know how to give answers,'' Sharansky, 41,
told a radio interviewer who pressed him to comment on the reported
appointment.
   In the early 1970s, Sharansky, a mathematician by profession, was
a member of a human rights watchdog organization headed by physicist
Andrei Sakharov, a Nobel Prize laureate.
   Sharansky gained prominence as a spokesman for the group. He had
wide contacts with foreign journalists in Moscow and emerged as a
champion of the Soviet Jewry emigration movement.
   Sharansky married in 1974. A day after the wedding, his wife,
Avital, left for Israel, hoping that he would soon follow.
   But Sharansky was denied exit visa. In March 1977, he was
arrested and in 1978 convicted of espionage and sentenced to 13
years in prison.
   He spent nine years in Soviet prisons and labor camps and became
a symbol of the Soviet Jews' plight, thanks to the efforts of
Avital, who tirelessy campaigned on his behalf in the West.
   Freedom came on Feb. 11, 1986, when Sharansky was released in a
dramatic East-West spy swap on Berlin's Glienicke Bridge.
   In Israel, Sharansky first kept a low profile, devoting himself
to family life. He and Avital now have two daughters, 2-year-old
Rachel and Hannah, born in November.
   Avital became an observant Jew during the years of Sharansky's
forced absence, but Sharansky has defines himself as non-religious.
Newspapers have speculated the marriage may fail apart because of
religious differences.
   Sharansky, for whom unity is a prime value, responded angrily to
the reports.
   ``I feel like my own bald pate has been conscripted into Israel's
Kulturkampf,'' or culture war, he said in a recent interview.
``People here concentrate too much on their differences ... instead
of principles and common aims.''
   Sharansky has successfully defeated attempts by many of Israel's
parties to lure him into their political embrace.
   But besieged by his former compatriots, he emerged last year to
found a lobby group that seeks to improve conditions for thousands
of Soviet immigrants plagued by shortages in jobs and housing.
   Unity, again, was the key, and Soviet Jewry activists said only
Sharansky could unite about 10 groups representing the immigrants.

<TEXT>
   If the city of such hostelries as the Waldorf,
the Pierre and the Plaza doesn't have enough truly first-class hotel
rooms, architect I.M. Pei has a solution: a 50-story hotel where
singles start at about $400 a night.
   ``It's an expensive piece of property, it's going to be expensive
to build, and it's going to be expensive as hell to live in,''
Robert Burns of Regent Hotels, which will run the Regent of New
York, said Tuesday at a news conference.
   The 400-room hotel, which will be on 57th Street in the heart of
Manhattan, is to open in 1991. It is expected to cost $300 million,
according to the developer, EIE International of Japan.
   Burns said nightly rates would be nearly $400 to $700 for suites.
   The developers say some international travelers, especially
business people on expense accounts, already are paying as much as
$400 a night in many of the world's largest cities, and will happily
do the same in New York.
   Pei's design calls for a tower of honey-colored limestone that
steps back gradually from its base, rising to a crown marked by four
lanterns.
   The Regent's 600-square-foot standard room will be the size of
many one-bedroom apartments in Manhattan, and about 40 percent
larger than the average New York hotel room, its developers said.
   According to a Regent Hotels description, each room will feature
walk-in closets, separate dressing areas, three telephones and two
telephone lines, two or three color television sets, connections for
computers and fax machines, and a videocassette recorder and compact
disc player.
   In a touch borrowed from Asia _ Regent is based in Hong Kong _
each floor, even upper ones with as few as six rooms, will have a
steward to attend to guests' needs. According to a news release,
these might include ``having a button sewn, flowers delivered, a
limousine ordered.''
   The most expensive hotel in New York City is probably the Plaza
Athenee on the upper East Side, where single rooms cost about $300.
Others, according to the Convention and Visitors Bureau, include the
Pierre at $250-$340; the Plaza at $215-$290, or $450 for a Central
Park view; and the Peninsula $210-$365. Relative bargains include
the Hilton at $155-$200, the Marriott Marquis at $210-$235 and the
Waldorf-Astoria at $180-$240.
   Business has been good, with an occupancy rate of about 76
percent, 10 percentage points higher than the national average,
according to the bureau.
   But, as staffer Kathleen Astrom noted, ``now things are going to
spread out.'' Several luxury hotels have opened in Manhattan in the
past year, and six more are under construction.

   The United States urged the Polish government
Tuesday to conduct a ``thorough and rapid'' investigation into the
recent deaths of two Catholic priests who were sympathetic to the
Solidarity labor union movement.
   ``We're following these cases with concern,'' said State
Department spokesman Charles Redman.
   The Rev. Stanislaw Suchowolec, 31, a pro-Solidarity priest, was
found dead Monday after a fire swept his apartment in the
northeastern city of Bialystok, 119 miles northeast of Warsaw.
Another priest, the Rev. Stefan Niedzielak, 74, died of a broken
neck on Jan. 21. Niedzielak also was sympathetic to the Solidarity
movement.
   ``We hope and expect Polish authorities will conduct a thorough
and rapid investigation, especially in light of (Suchowolec's)
reported relationship with opposition groups,'' Redman said.
   Of the Niedzielak case, the spokesman added, ``We also look
forward to the results of a thorough investigation of that killing.''

   The Navy on Tuesday awarded a $459.4 million
contract to Texas Instruments Inc., combining in one fixed-price
contract its fiscal 1989 order for HARM missiles along with those of
the Air Force and West Germany.
   The Navy, in a brief announcement, said it was buying 2,449
High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles, or HARMs, from Texas Instruments
this year. That combines an order for 1,319 for itself, 950 for the
Air Force and 180 for West Germany, the Navy said.
   The sale to West Germany, worth $35.2 million, is the first-ever
foreign sale of the weapon.
   The HARM missile is an air-to-ground missile used to attack enemy
radars of the sort that guide anti-aircraft guns and surface-to-air
missiles. The HARM guidance system is designed to automatically lock
on to the enemy radar's emissions.
   The Navy said Tuesday's contract was awarded to Texas
Instruments' Defense Systems and Electronics Group in Dallas and
will be administered by its Naval Air Systems Command.
   ``Delivery of these missiles will begin in December 1990 and will
continue through November 1991,'' the Navy said.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board on Tuesday
announced new restrictions on savings institutions' investments in
so-called ``junk bonds,'' which pay high interest rates but carry
more risk than investment-grade bonds.
   The agency, which regulates about 3,000 federally insured S&amp;Ls,
barred insolvent institutions from making new investments in junk
bonds and generally will require them to sell junk bonds they
already own.
   Exceptions to the rule are permitted if bank board examiners
believe holding the junk bonds is in the near-term interest of the
government insurance fund backing S&amp;L deposits.
   Solvent, but shaky, institutions that don't meet capital
requirements will be required to get government approval before
buying junk bonds.
   Existing regulations permit the purchase of junk bonds, but
institutions can invest no more than 5 percent of their portfolios
in a single junk bond mutual fund.
   Over the last several years, junk bonds have been a profitable
investment for many S&amp;Ls. Analysts worry, however, that if the
issuing companies default during an economic downturn, S&amp;Ls will be
stuck for a loss.
   At the end of last June, junk bonds accounted for $13 billion, or
1 percent, of the industry's $1.29 trillion in assets, the bank
board said.

<TEXT>
   Prices farmers get for raw products began 1989
with a 1.4 percent increase from December to January and were up 12
percent from a year ago, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its first
price report of the year that higher prices for cattle, hogs,
tomatoes and wheat were partly offset by lower prices for
strawberries, grapefruit, peanuts and oranges.
   New quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet
expenses rose 1.2 percent from October and averaged 6.1 percent more
than a year ago. Higher prices for feeder stock, including pigs and
cattle, along with higher calf prices accounted for most of the rise
since last fall.
   In a related report, the board said preliminary figures showed
last year's corn production, which was shriveled nearly a third by
drought and heat, had a value of more than $13 billion, an average
of $2.60 per bushel. That was down from almost $14 billion in 1987,
when the crop averaged only $1.94 per bushel.
   The value is USDA's estimate of how much a crop is worth, whether
a farmer sells it for cash or feeds it to livestock.
   Soybeans were valued at almost $11.9 billion, an average of $7.70
per bushel, compared with $11.3 billion and $5.88 in 1987. Wheat was
third at $6.63 billion and $3.70 per bushel, compared with a 1987
value of $5.5 billion and $2.57 per bushel.
   According to the preliminary January price figures, based mostly
on midmonth averages, the index for livestock and livestock products
as a group rose 1.9 percent from their December average and were up
6.8 percent from January 1988.
   The department's all-crops price index for January rose 0.7
percent from December and was up 20 percent from a year earlier.
Prices of food grains were up 3.2 percent from December. Wheat
prices rose 14 cents per bushel from December to $4.08 in January,
the highest since March 1981. Rice dropped 8 cents per 100 pounds to
$6.52 per hundredweight.
   Prices of commercial vegetables rose 8.2 percent from December,
with tomatoes and sweet corn leading the increase.
   The all-fruit price index dropped 6.8 percent from December but
still averaged 16.2 percent more than in January 1988.
   Oranges dropped to $6.20 per box from $6.50 in December but were
up from $5.64 a year earlier. Grapefruit declined to $3.72 per box
from $4.71 in December and $5.63 in January 1988.
   Although the projections are subject to change, USDA economists
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $48
billion to $58 billion this year, compared with a near-record of $57
billion in 1988. That is the difference between cash receipts and
cash expenses during the calendar year.
   Department economists say cash expenses are expected to rise
moderately in 1989 with expanded crop acreages and costlier
production items.
   Food prices in 1988 rose an average of about 3.7 percent, and
USDA analysts say another increase of 3 percent to 5 percent is
likely in 1989.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $69.30 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally,
up from $67.20 in December and $65.40 in January 1988. Those are
averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $41.70 per 100 pounds, compared with $39.70 in
December and $43 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.58 a bushel, was up from $2.53 in December and $1.77
in January 1988.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $4.08 per bushel, compared with $3.94 in December and $2.75
a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $6.52 per 100 pounds, down from $6.60 in December
and $7.93 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $7.64 per bushel, compared with $7.53 in December
and $5.73 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 54.2 cents per pound, down from
55.3 cents in December and 61.7 cents in January 1988.
   _Eggs were 63.7 cents per dozen, compared with 59.7 cents in
December and 49.3 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $13.40 per 100 pounds, compared with $13.50 in December
and $12.50 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 35.3 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
35.5 cents in December and 27.1 cents a year ago.

<HEAD>Administration To Propose Package Of Tax Breaks In Revised Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will propose a round of
tax breaks reflecting campaign promises in its Feb. 9 budget
rewrite, but disagreement has surfaced over a major component, a
reduction in the capital gains tax, officials said Tuesday.
   Administration budget writers have not reached a consensus on
whether the lower rates urged by Bush during his campaign should
apply equally to the sale of homes, stocks and other assets, said
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Treasury officials hope to minimize any adverse effect on the
budget deficit that might result from lowering the tax on certain
assets, such as private real estate and art objects.
   Sources said it is likely that the budget plan Bush unveils at
the time of his address to a joint session of Congress next week
also will include:
   _A child-care tax credit of up to $1,000 per child that would be
available to low-income families, generally those earning less than
$10,000 a year.
   _New tax incentives for oil and gas exploration, likely coupled
with a call for removal of remaining price controls on natural gas,
now affecting about 40 percent of production.
   _A proposal for tax-free ``enterprise zones'' to be established
in some inner city areas to promote commercial growth, a program
championed on Bush's nominee for Housing and Urban Development
secretary, former Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.
   In addition, administration officials are still wrestling with
terms of a package to help bail out troubled savings and loan
institutions, and it appeared likely that some variation on a
proposal for an increased fee for deposit insurance would be part of
the new Bush budget plan.
   Bush said even before he took office that his campaign vow to
propose a reduction in capital gains tax rates would be part of the
budget revisions he makes to the $1.15 trillion spending plan for
fiscal year 1990 that former President Reagan submitted Jan. 9.
   And Bush reiterated his support for such a plan in a news
conference last Friday.
   However, sources say there is still disagreement over exactly
what form the tax cut should take.
   Capital gains _ profits from the sale of real estate, stocks and
other assets _ are currently taxed at the same level as other
income, at 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent, depending on
overall income.
   Bush would lower the rate to a maximum of 15 percent.
   He claims that such a move would be an incentive to investment,
generating up to $4 billion a year in new revenues. However, many
leading economists, including the bipartisan Congressional Budget
Office, argue that lowering the tax would have the opposite effect _
reducing revenues and further worsening the budget deficit.
   To make sure the proposal does have the potential for spurring
investment, administration budget writers are trying to fine-tune it.
   For instance, while it could be argued that a lower capital gains
rate for the sale of coprorate stocks and commercial properties
might spur additional investment, it might be more difficult to
argue the same for the sale of private homes and objects of art,
analysts suggest.
   The package of tax breaks to be included in Bush's budget plan
all reflect promises he made during last year's presidential
campaign.
   However, White House officials say it seems unlikely that all of
Bush's promises will make it into the document _ budget constraints
being what they are.
   Bush must propose a plan that will get the federal budget
deficit, currently hovering at about $150 billion, down to below the
Gramm-Rudman target of $100 billion for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1.
   And, he has repeatedly vowed, he will do it without proposing new
taxes.
   ``Obviously we'll be setting priorities. I think you'll see
education, environmennt, child care,'' said a senior White House
official, insisting on anonmymity.
   On education, the official said the budget plan would highlight
``a few guiding principles,'' such as excellence and achievement and
accountability and choice of schools.
   However, some of Bush's campaign promises on education _
including a $500 million National Merit scholarship program, an
expansion of the Head Start program and a $50 million increase in
school experimentation _ may be considerably pruned back, sources
said.
   The sources also said Bush's campaign proposal to expand Medicaid
coverage to more lower-income Americans and to allow low-paid
workers to purchase it was being given a low priority in budget
preparation talks.
   ``There's no question George Bush wants to make this a kinder,
gentler nation. But he also wants to reduce the federal deficit. The
two have to be reconciled,'' said the senior White House official.
   Budget Director Richard G. Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady have been meeting almost daily to discuss key budget
decisions, according to White House aides.

<HEAD>Judge Says He'll Probably Let INS Restrict Travel Of Asylum Applicants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Tuesday he
probably will allow the Immigration and Naturalization Service to
return to a policy of restricting political asylum applicants to
southern Texas pending reviews.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela extended until Feb. 20 an order
blocking the procedure, but added: ``At that time, unless I'm
persuaded otherwise, the restraining order will be lifted.''
   ``We're pleased with the results,'' said William Joyce, associate
general counsel for the INS, who traveled from Washington for
Tuesday's hearing. ``The judge was fair.''
   INS critics cited a sharp increase in homeless Central Americans
living in squalid conditions in the area after the procedure took
effect Dec. 16. A group of immigration attorneys sued the INS over
the matter here on Jan. 6, and on Jan. 9 Vela issued a temporary
restraining order blocking the procedure.
   Under the procedure, the district began requiring asylum
applicants to file their claims in Harlingen and await decisions
there in 30 days, a period in which they were not allowed to work.
The most visible effect of the travel restriction was a rugged
campsite east of Brownsville, where more than 300 Central Americans
camped out on the ground under discarded cardboard and sheets of
plastic.
   Huge case backlogs in cities such as Miami and Los Angeles made
it necessary to keep the immigrants near their points of entry while
the government sorted out thousands of unfounded asylum claims, the
government maintains.
   The only issue Vela agreed to consider in the class-action
lawsuit, on behalf of Central Americans and other asylum-seekers in
the INS' Harlingen District, was whether the INS instituted the
change without allowing time for public comment as required in the
federal Administrative Procedures Act.
   ``I am somewhat inclined to believe that probably what was taking
place here would not require a notice and comment ... was more
procedural than substantive,'' Vela said.
   Robert Rubin, one of the attorneys suing the INS, said the
plaintiffs still hope the judge will rule against the INS after a
closer examination of the suit.
   ``The judge certainly indicated that he was not happy with the
situation as it existed, and strongly admonished the government that
he would be concerned if conditions ever returned to the state that
existed prior to his issuance of a temporary restraining order,''
said Rubin, with the San Francisco Lawyers' Committee for Urban
Affairs.
   Before Dec. 16, the INS allowed asylum-seekers who voluntarily
presented themselves to the Harlingen District to travel on to their
U.S. destinations, where they often were allowed to work while
pursuing their claims for refugee status.
   Hundreds of Central Americans left the area on northbound buses
and other vehicles after Vela made it possible for them to travel
again Jan. 9.
   Many headed for Miami. But officials from the Miami area visited
southern Texas to tell the refugees they had no shelter for them,
and joined officials in Texas in calling on the federal government
for help.
   Vela said he was concerned with past asylum statistics showing
that, of the thousands who traveled into the U.S. interior, 75
percent never showed up at INS offices to legally pursue their cases.
   More than 30,000 Central Americans, about half of them from
Nicaragua, passed through the Harlingen District in 1988, most
having crossed the Rio Grande illegally in the vicinity of the
border city of Brownsville, according to the INS.

<HEAD>DA Won't Oppose New Trial For `Thin Blue Line' Prisoner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man whose conviction for killing a police
officer was questioned in the movie ``The Thin Blue Line'' has
gotten the backing of the district attorney in his quest for a new
trial.
   A brief filed by District Attorney John Vance's office in the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on Monday said perjured testimony
may have tainted the conviction of Randall Dale Adams for the 1976
slaying of Robert Wood. Vance said, however, he still believes Adams
is guilty of the murder.
   The officer was shot at least five times during a traffic stop.
Adams, 40, has spent 12 years in prison, consistently maintaining
his innocence.
   A key witness changed his testimony last month and said Adams
wasn't even in the car stopped by Wood. A judge ruled Adams did not
get a fair trial and should either be granted another or set free.
   Evidence has surfaced that at least four other trial witnesses
lied, authorities have said. Last fall, the documentary ``The Thin
Blue Line'' examined the case.
   In the brief filed with the appeals court, Vance's office said it
``has no objection to ... the finding that (Adams) is entitled to a
new trial.''
   District Court Judge Larry Baraka, who heard three days of
testimony in December, concluded Adams was probably innocent, that
key witnesses had committed perjury and that former Assistant
District Attorney Doug Mulder suppressed crucial evidence that might
have cleared him.
   Vance told the Dallas Times Herald he had not read the brief his
office filed, he had instructed assistant prosecutors to send it to
the appeals court if they felt the evidence supported Adams' claims.
   ``I told them to do whatever was right on the thing. If that's
the way it was, that's the way it was,'' said Vance.
   The prosecutor said that if Adams is granted a new trial, he will
try to charge Adams again.
   ``It's obviously a radical shift in their position,'' said
defense lawyer Randy Schaffer. ``At least on the surface, it appears
they're doing the honorable thing.''
   He added he plans to use Vance's brief in his efforts to persuade
the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to free Adams while the
appeals court considers the case.

<HEAD>Brady Testifies on Buyout Tax Law Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady gave a
qualified endorsement Tuesday to limiting tax deductions for
interest payments on debt incurred in leveraged buyouts, if the
resulting revenue were used to reduce taxes on stock dividends.
   ``If you're going to make a change _ and clearly we're not
suggesting one _ we would suggest that you look in the area of
perhaps limiting interest deductions and using that money to give a
break to corporate owners of stock,'' Brady told the House Ways and
Means Committee.
   Echoing his testimony last week before the Senate Finance
Committee, Brady said the Bush administration would prefer Congress
``wait a little'' to see if the trend of leveraged buyouts, which
approached $100 billion in 1988, begins to diminish on its own.
   ``We have a habit of correcting things just as they are about to
correct themselves,'' Brady said. ``If we wait a little longer, this
thing is not going to gobble us up. We can't prove at this point
that the economy has been damaged.''
   Congressional Democrats, however, made it clear they're under
pressure to rein in junk-bond-financed corporate takeovers,
particularly because insurance companies and other holders of
long-term, investment-grade bonds are beginning to be hurt in the
deals.
   For example, owners of some $5 billion in long-term bonds in
RJR-Nabisco Co., saw the value of those securities drop by a $1
billion to $4 billion almost overnight upon the announcement of its
pending takeover by buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
last fall for $25 billion.
   ``I have a feeling that we're looking at a Richter scale that's
showing zero and then we have an eruption of 7 or 8 on the scale and
it's too late,'' said Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., using a major
earthquake with widespread, heavy damage as a metaphor.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the panel's chairman, said the
outcry for congressional action has become deafening in the 16
months since then-Treasury Secretary and now Secretary of State
James A. Baker III tried to blame the 1987 stock market crash on an
attempt then to curb leveraged buyouts through tax law changes.
   Brady agreed that the ``driving force'' behind the buyout
phenomenon is that companies can avoid a 34 percent corporate income
tax rate by raising their capital through debt rather than stock
sales.
   He said the Treasury Department also has been attempting to find
a way through Internal Revenue Service regulations or a legislative
proposal to make the tax treatment of stock-equity and bond-debt
financing more equal, saying the buyout problem would disappear with
a ``level playing field.''
   ``So far we haven't been able to come up with one,'' he said,
adding that the financial community's response to his appeals for
suggestions has been ``disappointing.''
   Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, likened Brady's qualified endorsement
of reducing the tax deductibility of interest on junk bonds in
exchange for a corporate tax credit on dividends to ``a kiss through
a veil'' and criticized him for not coming up with specific
suggestions.

<HEAD>Americans Last in Math, Below the Mean in Science in International
Survey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American teen-agers scored dead last in math
and well below the mean in science in an international survey whose
results ``pose a serious challenge to our position in the world
community,'' the Educational Testing Service said Tuesday.
   The U.S. youngsters were outperformed in math by their
counterparts in four other countries and four Canadian provinces and
were among the worst science achievers in the assessment of 24,000
13-year-olds.
   ``The obvious conclusion is that unless we're careful, the Buck
Rogers of the 1990s is going to be living in Seoul, Korea, instead
of Chattanooga or Chicago,'' said former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander, now president of the University of Tennessee.
   ``How many times must this nation be reminded of its educational
deficit?'' Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos asked in a statement,
referring to repeated findings that U.S. children perform poorly in
math and science.
   Cavazos called the situation ``a national tragedy,'' while other
educators termed the survey results frightening and devastating.
   ETS officials tried to put a less-pessimistic face on their
findings, noting that almost all of the U.S. teen-agers demonstrated
mastery of basic math skills and knowledge of everyday science facts.
   ``We are making improvements on our own terms. We are educating
every child in America,'' said Archie Lapointe, executive director
of the ETS Center for the Assessment of Educational Progress.
   ``Everyone is talking now about higher-order skills, higher
standards. I'm very confident that this is going to happen,''
Lapointe added. ``If we articulate what we want to do, the schools
will deliver.''
   But Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said elementary school teachers won't be able to deliver
unless they are required to take math and science courses to qualify
for their licenses.
   ``We've got a long way to go before we turn it around,'' Shanker
said. ``The next generation of (elementary school) teachers has
already been educated without math or science. You've got a terrible
pipeline problem.''
   The assessment, financed by the National Science Foundation and
the Department of Education, was based on tests of students in
Ireland, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States,
and Canada's British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec.
The last three were divided into French- and English-speaking
samples.
   Korean students demonstrated the highest overall mathematics
achievement while those from the United States and French-speaking
Ontario showed the lowest. Youths in South Korea and British
Columbia turned in the best science performance. The United States,
along with Ireland and French-speaking Ontario and New Brunswick,
``perform well below the mean,'' the report said.
   Among the specific findings:
   _Seventy-eight percent of the Korean 13-year-olds can use
intermediate mathematics skills to solve two-step problems such as
computing the average age of five children. That compares with only
40 percent in the United States and French-speaking Ontario. The
report called the U.S. performance ``a matter for grave concern.''
   _Forty percent of the Korean students understand measurement and
geometry concepts and can solve more complex problems, such as
figuring out the radius of a circle. That compares with under 10
percent in the United States and French-speaking Ontario.
   _Despite their poor performance, two-thirds of U.S. students said
they considered themselves ``good at mathematics.'' Only 23 percent
of Korean students, the highest achievers, shared that attitude.
   _More than 70 percent of the youngsters in Korea and British
Columbia can use scientific procedures and analyze scientific data
compared with only 35 percent to 40 percent in the four bottom
nations and provinces.
   ``The United States has traditionally thought of itself as
technologically innovative and in the forefront in science,'' the
report said. ``These results are sobering and pose a serious
challenge to our position in the world community.''
   Many educators said U.S. performance could be improved if
teachers and parents expected more of students and showed more
enthusiasm themselves about science and math. And they said
international comparisons are helpful in determining how high
expectations should be.

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said at a U.N. Human Rights
Commission meeting Tuesday that Israeli soldiers have fired tear gas
into hospitals and homes during the Palestinian uprising, causing up
to 60 deaths.
   Israel denied the charges.
   An envoy of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in an apparent
reference to the accusation, told the 43-nation meeting Palestinian
children had died in ``Israeli gas chambers.''
   Amnesty spokeswoman Ingrid Kircher read a statement saying the
Israeli forces fired tear gas into hospitals and homes, a
``deliberate misuse'' because manufacturers' instructions say the
gas can kill in confined places.
   She said about 60 people were reported to have died in tear
gas-related incidents, ``some of them as a direct result of its
misuse.''
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said in
Jerusalem: ``It's all a great lie. Israel has certainly not shot
into hospitals.''
   An army spokesman said Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip act ``in accordance with the international law and
judicial procedures.''
   The spokesman said on condition of anonymity that the army will
provide a detailed response to the allegations after a ``careful
study of the report.''
   The PLO observer, Nabil Ramlawi, made the reference to ``Israeli
gas chambers'' in his remarks to the U.N. meeting in Geneva.
   Many of the 6 million Jews who died in the Nazi holocaust were
killed in Nazi gas chambers.
   Ramlawi also accused the Israelis of beating pregnant women to
cause them to miscarry, burying people alive to save ammunition
instead of shooting them, and stealing organs from wounded
Palestinian patients to be used in transplant operations on Israelis.
   The statement of London-based Amnesty expressed grave concern
over what it called ``extensive human rights violations'' by Israel
despite growing domestic and international protests. It said Israeli
authorities ``appear so far to have condoned _ if not encouraged _
the excessive use of force.''
   More than 365 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in the
13-month revolt. The Palestinians are protesting occupation by
Israel, which seized the lands from neighboring Arab states in the
1967 Middle East war.
   Amnesty said about 300 civilians have been shot to death by
Israeli soldiers.
   The group's statement also said thousands of Palestinians _
including children, elderly people, and wounded patients _ have been
``forcibly removed from hospitals'' and beaten by Israeli army and
security forces. It said at least eight of the victims died.
   Amnesty urged the Israeli government to crack down on excessive
use of force and prosecute those guilty of abuses.

<HEAD>Former Commander of USS Pueblo Gives `More Frank Account' of 1968
Capture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE LAYFIELD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea's capture of the USS Pueblo and its
83-man crew, who were held prisoner for 11 months in 1968, would not
have occurred if the Navy had acted properly, the ship's former
commander said.
   ``The story of the Pueblo, in a nutshell, is one of a naval
officer, his crew, and his ship, set to do a job; things went bad,
and the Navy abandoned them,'' retired Comm. Lloyd M. Bucher said in
a letter published this week in two naval magazines.
   In an interview Tuesday, Bucher said he was speaking out two
decades later because ``I was still an emotional nervous wreck and I
could not concentrate on doing a job of presenting a good solid
case'' at an investigation after the incident.
   ``I would say this article is a more frank account than I have
given before,'' he said. ``Not because I didn't try to give an
accurate account before, but because I have a much clearer
understanding of the event than I had at the time of the inquiry in
1968-69.''
   Bucher, 61, who retired from the Navy in 1973, described the
incident in a book, ``Bucher: My Story,'' published in 1970. He is
now an artist in Poway, Calif.
   Bucher's letter appeared in Proceedings and Naval History
magazines published by the U.S. Naval Institute in Annapolis, a
professional society for sea services personnel.
   To mark the 20th anniversary of the Pueblo incident, the 1988
fall issue of Naval History published the reflections of five flag
officers who were involved in the incident.
   Bucher's letter was an unsolicited response to that article, said
Paul Stillwell, editor-in-chief of Naval History.
   ``I was surprised when I saw the (initial) article. Ninety
percent of what was in that article was never mentioned during the
Pueblo inquiry. It was filled with misinformation,'' Bucher said.
   The Pueblo lacked the proper equipment to repel an attack, Navy
admirals knew the mission was risky yet approved it anyway, and
Pueblo officers were not kept properly informed of world events
affecting the ship, Bucher charged in his letter.
   The Pueblo, under the guise of a technical research ship, was
commissioned to seek intelligence, including pinpointing radar and
other defense installations. The North Koreans captured the vessel
on Jan. 23, 1968, keeping its crew hostage until Dec. 22, 1968. One
sailor died in captivity.
   Rear Admiral Frank L. Johnson, then-commander of Naval forces in
Japan, wanted two .50-caliber machine guns stowed below the decks of
the Pueblo. When Bucher argued that the guns should be available for
use topside, Johnson ordered that they be covered by tarps to
disguise them.
   Bucher has been widely criticized for not having fired a shot to
protect the ship.
   Retired Admiral John J. Hyland, then-commander in chief of the
Pacific Fleet, levied sharp criticism against Bucher in the initial
article.
   ``He never manned the guns. He didn't go to general quarters
until he'd already been fired upon and sustained some casualties.
... Bucher got a completely failing grade,'' he said.
   Bucher wrote that the Pueblo was surrounded by four Korean
torpedo boats and one gunboat, and ``there was no possiblity of
manning our machine guns, or getting to the ammunition ... The tarps
were frozen and the gun positions totally exposed.''
   From the outset, Navy officials knew that it was risky to send an
essentially unarmed ship into international waters off North Korea,
Bucher said. He also said he had been told that there was no
probability of an attack, but that Navy officials promised
retaliation just in case, Bucher said.
   In fact, no U.S. forces came to the Pueblo's aid despite a call
for help, he said.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Seek Moratorium on Cuts in Medicare Payments to Hospitals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 160 senators and representatives put
their names on a proposed resolution Tuesday seeking a one-year
moratorium on cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals.
   Reductions in Medicare payments to health care institutions will
accelerate the growing rate of hospital closures, putting the health
care of the elderly, disabled and even entire communities at risk,
the lawmakers said.
   Though they acknowledged the nation's budget pressures, the
sponsors said Congress also needs time to analyze the impact of the
payment policies of the $87 billion federal health insurance program
for the elderly and disabled.
   ``One year from now I think we're going to be in a position to
make a better judgment about where we should go and what we should
do,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a chief sponsor of the
non-binding resolution. ``But to devastate hospitals further today,
to put the squeeze on the poor and elderly of this nation is
unwise.''
   Former President Reagan, before he left office last month, sent
Congress a proposed budget for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1,
that trimmed $2.4 billion from Medicare Part A, the section of the
program that pays hospitals. He also proposed cutting about $1
billion from Medicare Part B, which pays physicians.
   Reagan called for a total 10 percent growth in total Medicare
spending, which would hold the program's budget to $94.9 billion
next year.
   President Bush is due to send Congress his budget proposal next
week, and according to Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Ways and Means subcommittee on health, the Medicare portion is
expected to be about the same as Reagan proposed.
   Stark told reporters that Bush budget director Richard Darman
told him last week that his budget proposal ``won't be much
different from the Reagan proposal relative to Medicare, and my
guess is the (House) Budget Committee will come out at somewhere
between $2 (billion) and $5 (billion) cut in Medicare.''
   ``I can't really see that we'll do anything different from what
we've done in previous years, and that means we'll take some out of
the hospitals and some out of the doctors and will try to give some
assistance in that to the inner city hospitals ... and rural
hospitals,'' he said.
   Members of the American Hospital Association are in Washington
this week for the group's annual meeting and they have been visiting
the lawmakers on Capitol Hill about issues of interest, including
the resolution for a one-year reprieve from cuts.
   ``This resolution is very important to say: Wait. We simply
cannot make further reductions without cutting into the quality of
care,'' said Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.
   The lawmakers noted that more than 80 hospitals closed last year,
more than 400 have closed since 1982 and many others are losing
money, particularly rural and inner city hospitals. Medicare
cutbacks are largely to blame, they said.
   ``Fifty percent of hospitals are losing money on every Medicare
patient,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn. ``We cannot cost-cut
with blindness to the consequences of that policy.''
   Meanwhile, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, introduced legislation
designed to save faltering rural hospitals by boosting government
reimbursements for patient care and improving physican recruitment.
   Bentsen blamed inequities in the Medicare prospective payment
system for contributing to the problems of rural hospitals. Under
the program, hospitals are reimbursed for the average costs of their
elderly Medicare patients and not on actual costs.

<HEAD>EPA Chief Promises Acid Rain Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Reilly, picked to head the
Environmental Protection Agency, said Tuesday his chief
anti-pollution priority will be acid rain and he promised to produce
a legislative proposal for the problem as soon as possible.
   ``Acid rain for our point of view is first out of the box,'' he
told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The panel is
expected to vote later this week on Reilly's nomination as head of
the federal government's top agency dealing with the environment.
   ``It's ahead of everything else,'' Reilly said at another point
when asked by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., if he believed acid
rain was a serious problem.
   For more than six years, Congress has been grappling with
legislation to curb acid rain. But tough national legislation didn't
gain White House support under former President Reagan and last year
became bogged down in Congress.
   Acid rain, blamed for polluting vast areas of vegetation, streams
and lakes along the country's northern tier and in Canada, is caused
primarily by emissions from fossil fuel burning plants in the
Midwest and Ohio Valley.
   Reilly said President Bush is committed to ``the substantial
reduction of acid rain by the end of this century'' and the EPA is
working to develop proposed changes in the federal Clean Air Act to
deal with the acid rain problem.
   During the 2{-hour hearing, both Republicans and Democrats,
including senators who are often on opposite sides, praised Reilly,
who for 16 years has been executive director of the Conservation
Foundation and the president of World Wildlife Fund.
   Sen. Quentin Burdick, R-N.D., committee chairman, called Reilly
``a person ... who appreciates that a great nation must be a good
steward of its land, its air, its water and its natural resources.''
   ``I'm pleased to join the chorus of admirers and welcomers,''
said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., noting Reilly was introduced to
the panel by no fewer than five senators from three states.
   Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, objected to what he called the EPA's
often ``heavy handed'' approach to enforcing environmental laws. But
he praised Reilly's nomination.
   Reilly promised to enforce such laws ``aggressively and timely
whenever it is warranted to safeguard public health and
environmental quality,'' but said he also hopes to deal with
environmental problems through consensus and cooperation.
   Denouncing the ``bitterness, the polarization, the wasted
resources and other excesses'' that have marked conflicts between
environmentalists and industry in the past, Reilly said he is
convinced the country can both protect its environment and have
economic growth.
   Several senators, noting Reilly's desire for consensus, expressed
concern that the approach might lead to inaction on part of the EPA.
   ``Will you conciliate, mediate, negotiate away our environmental
laws?'' asked Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who supported Reilly.
   Lieberman urged Reilly to be ``an environmental advocate'' in the
Bush administration and not allow the EPA to be a ``reluctant
combatant as it often has been'' in the Reagan administration.
   ``You can count on me being an advocate,'' replied Reilly.

   Two tiny polyps removed from Gov. William
A. O'Neill's colon were found to be non-cancerous, according to test
results released Tuesday.
   The polyps were discovered and removed Monday during O'Neill's
regularly scheduled six-month checkup. A year ago, one of three
polyps removed from O'Neill's colon contained cancer cells. Three
removed in June were benign.
   ``We are very happy to report that the pathology analysis has
confirmed that the two polyps are a common type of benign polyp,''
said Dr. Jay Benson, coordinator of gastroenterology at St. Francis
Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford.
   ``There was no evidence of any malignancy or pre-cancerous
changes. Removal of the polyps constitutes complete and definitive
treatment,'' Benson said.
   He said O'Neill, 58, would be required to return for another
checkup in six months because there is, on average, a 5 percent to
15 percent chance of recurrence.
   O'Neill went to his office after Monday's procedure and resumed
normal working hours Tuesday.

   About 80 demonstrators demanding more
commitment to stopping AIDS closed the Golden Gate Bridge during
Tuesday's morning rush hour, stalling thousands of commuters in a
traffic jam.
   The fog-shrouded bridge was closed for 46 minutes while Highway
Patrol officers arrested 26 protesters affiliated with a group
called ``Stop AIDS Now Or Else.'' The demonstrators were cited on
charges of trespassing and creating a public nuisance and then
released, officials said.
   A spokeswoman for the group said they chose the bridge for the
protest because it would be ``the most disruptive to people.''
   ``AIDS is disrupting our lives and until people's lives are
disrupted, they don't pay attention,'' said Darla Rucker,
spokeswoman for the group of AIDS victims and friends of AIDS
patients.
   ``We don't have the time to wait. My friends are dying all around
me.''
   The demonstrators closed all the traffic lanes by spreading a
banner that read: ``AIDS = Genocide; Silence = Death; Fight Back,''
according to Highway Patrol officers, who called for police vans to
cart off those arrested.
   Some motorists stuck along U.S. 101 north and south of the bridge
expressed anger at the demonstration and traffic tie-up.
   Ruth Wheeler, of Larkspur, said she veered off the highway in
Marin County, parked at a Safeway store and queued up with some 20
people to use five public telephones.
   ``People at Safeway were very upset. They said it was going to
defeat their (the protesters') cause,'' said Wheeler, who finally
arrived at her destination about 9:30 a.m. ``The people said, `Hey,
if they think I'm going to be for them, doing something like this,
forget it.'''
   One motorist whose trip into San Francisco usually takes a
half-hour finally parked his car and took a ferry across the bay.
Although he beat most of the traffic, he said it took him two hours
to reach his office.
   Leaflets that the protesters distributed to motorists criticized
the government's handling of the AIDS crisis, quoted several AIDS
victims and urged motorists to ``Get out of your car and join us.''
   ``Are you sick and tired of being stuck on this bridge? So are
we!'' the leaflet said. ``Are you wondering how long it will be? So
are we! Are you wondering `Why me?' So are we!''
   A caller to The Associated Press bureau in San Francisco said the
group was protesting ``the inactivity of the government the last
eight years and telling George Bush we're not going to remain
inactive.''
   ``We're going to continue to put pressure on Washington to do
more for people with AIDS,'' the caller said, refusing to identify
himself.

   National Park Service staffers in Yellowstone
National Park fought last summer's forest fires so
unenthusiastically that critics might well charge them with illegal
use of funds, according to an internal memo given to Congress on
Tuesday.
   The Aug. 15 memo was written for the western regional director by
Sequoia National Park fire specialist Howard Nichols, who paid a
one-week visit to Yellowstone starting last July 28 to help project
the courses of the fires.
   On July 21, Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel ordered the
service to drop its ``let it burn'' policy and fight all fires. By
the time snow arrived in late September, more than 700,000 acres, a
third of the park, had been burned over, though the service says
almost all of that will quickly rejuvenate.
   Under the ``let it burn'' policy, fires that met certain
conditions were supposed to be allowed to burn themselves out, but
fires that threatened lives or developed areas or areas outside the
park were supposed to be fought.
   The Forest Service, part of the Agriculture Department, conducts
commercial timbering on most land adjacent to Yellowstone, and
fights all fires there.
   ``The tactics used for these fires might well result in the
suggestion that Yellowstone was using suppression dollars to achieve
natural resource benefits, a patently illegal use of these funds,''
said the Nichols memo.
   Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont., submitted the memo at a joint hearing
of the national parks subcommittee of the House Interior Committee
and the forests subcommittee of the House Agriculture Committee.
   On the memo, another official, Bruce Kilgore, chief of resource
management and research in the western region of the service, had
written, ``Perhaps not circulated widely at this time ... until we
get our act together.''
   Projections made on July 3 by the Yellowstone staff ``showed, as
we did, that the Fan fire would eventually leave Yellowstone and
burn Forest Service lands. Yet no firm suppression action was taken
until the fire was within a mile of the boundary,'' Nichols wrote.
   The memo said the Yellowstone staff often ``seemed to be
satisfied to call the ... park boundary the confinement line''
corresponding to natural boundaries that could be relied on to check
fires, ``although few natural barriers could be found there.''
   After Hodel's order, ``in spite of millions being spent and 2,000
fires, Yellowstone staffers were bemoaning the fact that new starts,
as mandated by the secretary'' had to be fought, the memo said.
   Despite his criticisms, Nichols said the fires had improved the
ecosystem of the park.
   Marlenee said the memo showed that Hodel's policy was ``not being
carried out,'' though it did not make specific allegations that the
secretary's order was disobeyed.
   Denis Galvin, deputy director of the park service, said points
raised in the memo would be ``absolutely'' checked out by an
internal investigations team.
   Marlenee and other members of the Congress have accused the park
service of disregarding the interests of residents dependent on
tourism through the ``let it burn'' policy.

<HEAD>Wind Damage to Land Worse in November, December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wind damage to land in the Great Plains is up
sharply, reflecting the 1988 drought that hit much of the nation in
the spring and summer, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said nearly 2.2 million acres were reported damaged in
November and December, up more than 80 percent from 1.2 million
acres in the same two months of 1987.
   ``A lot of the damage is a result of drought,'' Scaling said.
``The reasons vary by area, but major factors are lack of (crop)
residue and poor vegetative cover _ both caused by a lack of
moisture.''
   Scaling said more than 80 percent of the land reported damaged
was cropland, the remainder primarily rangeland.
   Texas accounted for more than 30 percent of the erosion damage in
November and December with 664,128 acres.
   Scaling said that in addition to the damaged land in November and
December, nearly 19 million acres were ``in condition to blow,''
with five months still remaining in the critical wind season.
   November and December are the first two months of an annual
seven-month season when winds are highest and the soils are driest
in the Great Plains. Surveys were made in 541 counties of the
10-state region.
   Although the 1987-88 season began with relatively light damage,
it picked up as moisture conditions worsened. When the season ended
last May 31, more than 13 million acres had been damaged, the
second-largest acreage since the agency began records in 1935.
   The most widespread was in 1955 when about 16 million acres of
Great Plains land were damaged by wind. Another bad year was 1980-81
when 12.5 million acres were damaged.
   According to the survey, the state-by-state breakdown comparing
damaged acres in November and December with the damage during the
same two months of 1987-88, included:
   _Colorado, 28,795 acres damaged this season and 17,070 in 1987-88.
   _Kansas, 135,550 and 31,520.
   _Montana, 510,875 and 304,023.
   _Nebraska, 54,405 and 74,590.
   _New Mexico, 51,100 and 3,300.
   _North Dakota, 188,200 and 230,000.
   _Oklahoma, 68,480 and 31,288.
   _South Dakota, 112,250 and 69,400.
   _Texas, 664,128 and 250,220.
   _Wyoming, 346,754 and 190,885.

   Three years after stepping out of Soviet prison,
human rights activist Natan Sharansky appears headed for a new
career as Israel's ambassador to the United Nations.
   An aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and another senior
government official Tuesday confirmed radio reports that Shamir
chose Sharansky for the post, which will have to be approved by the
Cabinet.
   Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman, said the prime minister hopes the
former refusenik's worldwide popularity will be a boon to Israel's
public image that has taken a beating during the Palestinian
uprising.
   ``We hope he could help improve our image,'' Pazner said. ``This
is definitely the consideration.''
   Later, however, Pazner said in a statement that Sharansky had not
yet been officially nominated. ``Such an idea was indeed raised, but
there is no decision yet on that nomination,'' he said.
   The report that Sharansky was chosen took many Israelis by
surprise and prompted concern among some diplomats about angering
the Soviet Union at a time when Moscow has ended a 20-year
diplomatic break to improve ties with the Jewish state.
   Sharansky, 41, served nine years of a 13-year sentence in Soviet
prisons and labor camp on charges of anti-Soviet espionage before
being freed in a dramatic East-West spy swap on Berlin's Glienicke
Bridge on Feb. 11, 1986.
   Sharansky was an outspoken activist for the emigration movement
of Soviet Jews and belonged to a human rights committee headed by
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov that sharply criticized
Soviet treatment of prisoners and national minorities.
   Sharansky's case was made famous largely by the efforts of his
wife, Avital, who waged a tireless campaign during their forced
separation of 12 years.
   Sharansky did not answer his telephone Tuesday and declined
direct comment when interviewed by Israel army radio, saying he had
not been formally appointed.
   Pressed by the interviewer, Sharansky added: ``I will say only
what I want to say. I have enough experience with interrogations and
I know how to give answers.''
   A government official said Sharansky also was the choice of
Israel's Russian-born Foreign Minister Moshe Arens. His appointment
will need approval from Finance Minister Shimon Peres under his
Labor Party's coalition agreement with Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc. It also will need Cabinet approval.
   One government official said on condition of anonymity that the
approval may be delayed over fears of offending the Soviet Union,
which has warmed ties with Israel recently. The Soviets broke
relations after Israel occupied Arab land during the 1967 Middle
East war.
   ``Now that we're on the eve of renewing diplomatic ties, on such
a delicate time in our relations with Moscow, it could take some
time to determine whether this would not offend them,'' said the
official.
   Sharansky has kept a low profile in Israel. Last year, he founded
a lobby group that seeks to improve conditions for thousands of
Soviet emigres plagued by shortages in jobs and housing.
   He has stayed out of politics and said in a recent interview with
The Associated Press that he had not found his place in any of the
parties.
   He was critical of the divisiveness in Israel's 120-member
Parliament that has 15 parties and said he would like to see the
electoral system changed. ``I'm concern that everything in Israel is
partisan. I'd like to see more mutual values and consensus in party
politics,'' Sharansky said.
   At the United Nations, Sharansky may find himself being called on
to defend Israel's strong tactics in trying to quell the nearly
14-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Arab groups once sought his support in vain, he said. ``To say
that because Sharansky was against the Soviet Union this should also
make him against the Israeli government, this isn't true. There is
no parallel between them,'' he said.
   Sharansky said he investigated complaints about Israel's behavior
in the territories and defended the stance of his new homeland.
   ``For a country in a state of war, you cannot have the same rules
as for a country not at war. But it is important to keep
democracy,'' Sharansky said.

   Burley tobacco farmers will have a 1989
national marketing quota of 587.6 million pounds, up 24 percent from
last year's 473 million pounds, the Agriculture Department announced
Tuesday.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg said the 1989 crop
price support will be $1.532 per pound, up 3.2 cents from the 1988
level.
   Goldberg said the budget deficit assessment _ an assessment on
payments mandated by 1987 budget legislation _ on this year's crop
will be 0.34 cents per pound, divided equally between the producer
and buyer of burley tobacco. The assessment to finance the
no-net-cost burley program will be announced later, he said.
   Burley tobacco producers will be polled Feb. 27 to March 2 to
decide whether marketing quotas on a poundage basis will continue
for the next three years, he said. More than a two-thirds majority
of those voting are required for approval of the quotas. In the last
vote, 97 percent favored quotas for the 1986, 1987 and 1988 crops.

<HEAD>Company Suspected Of Selling Rocket Parts To Libya, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors on Tuesday launched a
criminal investigation of a Munich company suspected of illegally
selling rocket guidance equipment to Libya, West German television
reported.
   Earlier Tuesday, a government-owned company said it found
evidence that it was duped by another West German firm into
providing plans for a suspeted poison gas factory in Libya,
believing the technology was being used for a Hong Kong
pharmaceutical plant.
   The ARD television network said customs officials in Stuttgart
gave Munich investigators documents linking the company Globesat to
the alleged sale of rocket guidance equipment to Libya.
   The report gave no additional details but said officials suspect
West German export laws and regulations governing the sale of
military technology may have been violated.
   Globesat's Munich offices were closed Tuesday night, and company
officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
   Another Bavarian company is under investigation by prosecutors in
Munich in connection with allegations that it helped Libya develop
the ability to refuel its warplanes in flight.
   Meanwhile, the government-owned Salzgitter Industriebau GmbH said
in a statement that a review of company records ``revealed that were
were deceived'' in its transactions with Imhausen-Chemie, a company
suspected of playing a larger role in the suspected chemical weapons
plant in Libya.
   Salzgitter said that among its records was a letter from
Imhausen-Chemie that mentioned Rabta, site of the plant south of the
Libyan capital of Tripoli. The statement did not reveal further
contents of the February 1985 letter but said it was turned over to
prosecutors investigating possible violations of export laws.
   Salzgitter officials have acknowledged doing business with the
Lahr-based chemical concern but have said it was contracted to
produce engineeering designs for a pharmaceutical plant in Hong Kong.
   ``Employees who were working on the Hong Kong project at the time
did not assign any importance to the mention of Rabta'' in the
letter, the statement said.
   The company said it had also sent experts to Hong Kong to inspect
the factory it was contracted to design and found ``that our work
had not been put to use there.''
   It also said switching equipment Salzgitter supplied was not
installed there.
   Salzgitter officials said the company is considering legal action
against Imhausen-Chemie.
   U.S. officials contend the plant in Libya is designed to produce
chemical weapons. Libya says it is a pharmaceutical factory.
   Imhausen-Chemie is the target of a criminal investigation to
determine if export laws were broken in connection with deliveries
for the Libyan plant.
   Several companies have admitted doing work for Imhausen-Chemie,
but deny knowledge that their equipment and blueprints were destined
for Libya.

<TEXT>
   Federal subsidies totaling almost $1.3 billion
are being paid to cotton and rice farmers for taking part in 1988
acreage programs, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the departments
Commodity Credit Corp., said eligible producers of upland cotton
will receive final deficiency payments of $725 million under the
1988 program.
   The rice payments total $570 million, he said.
   Deficiency payments are made under a formula to make up the
difference betwen a target price for a commodity and an average of
market prices or the government price support loan rate, whichever
is higher.
   In the case of cotton, for example, the market price average was
56.5 cents per pound, or higher than the support level of 51.8
cents. The target was 75.9 cents. Thus, the ``deficiency'' payment
is 19.4 cents per pound.
   For rice, the target was $11.15 per 100 pounds. The market price
average of $6.84 exceeded the loan rate of $6.63, so the deficiency
payment is 4.31 per hundredweight.

<HEAD>Leftist Newspaper Folds After 112 Years, Bans By Bismarck and Hitler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newspaper Vorwaerts (Forward),
which survived bans by Bismarck and Hitler and championed Social
Democratic causes for 112 years, is folding because of heavy
financial losses, the party said Tuesday.
   The Social Democratic Party has spent about $27 million since
1970 to cover the weekly newspaper's losses.
   But rising costs and falling circulation forced the party to
close the newspaper, party treasurer Hans-Ulrich Klose told
reporters.
   The decision, reached ``with a heavy heart,'' came after it
became clear that the leftist-liberal newspaper would not be able to
raise its circulation of 46,000 by 50 percent.
   The weekly's staff of 44 will lose their jobs when the last issue
goes on sale on Saturday.
   Founded in 1876 by Wilhelm Hasenclever and Wilhelm Liebknecht,
Vorwaerts stopped appearing for 12 years when Chancellor Otto von
Bismarck banned the Social Democrats in 1878.
   Vorwaerts took a strong anti-Nazi line and was banned by Adolf
Hitler in 1933. Its staff went into exile and continued to publish
in Prague and then Paris until German troops marched into Paris in
1940.
   The newspaper returned to German soil in September 1948 as the
official organ of the Social Democratic party.
   The national printers trade union criticized the decision by the
party's leadership to fold the paper, saying the public was losing
``an important voice.''

   First lady Barbara Bush on Tuesday helped make
sandwiches for the homeless and read to children at a daycare center
for poor children as she visited a drug-infested area of the
nation's capital to laud the work of volunteers.
   Arriving at Martha's Table about 20 blocks from the White House,
Mrs. Bush put on a red apron to make salami and cheese sandwiches
for a food truck operated by the non-profit center to feed the
homeless.
   That done, she sat in a rocking chair as children from the
facility's daycare center gathered around, quietly munching cookies
she had brought from the White House.
   Mrs. Bush, the mother of five and grandmother of 10, read from
the book ``How Fletcher Was Hatched.''
   At one point, a dog in the book was described as howling. Mrs.
Bush looked at the children's upturned faces and asked, ``Who can
howl like a dog?''
   That produced a cacaphony of yelping with little resemblence to a
howl but Mrs. Bush smiled and said, ``You got it.''
   The book proved to be longer than she had anticipated _ ``This is
the longest book,'' she exclaimed at one point _ so she deftly
summarized and improvised to avoid reading page after page.
   The children seemed to take her visit in stride. When she had
finished, one girl asked her to quiz the audience on what they'd
just heard.
   Mrs. Bush merrily complied, asking about the name of the
protagonist dog and the story's plot as the children chorused the
answers.
   Asked by reporters if she planned to make the homeless and needy
a special project, she noted that she is also involved in fighting
illiteracy and said, ``Anybody who needs help and I can help them,
I'm planning to try to help.''
   She said she hoped her visit to Martha's Table would help
Americans realize how important volunteers are, ``what a job they do
and how really important it is to help people who need a little
help.''

<HEAD>Opposition Charges Coverup On Chun; Students Attack U.S. Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition accused the government
of a coverup after prosecutors issued a report Tuesday that did not
link former President Chun Doo-hwan to corruption and power abuse.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, dozens of students demanding
punishment for Chun and the withdrawal of American troops threw
firebombs at a U.S. cultural center for the second time this month.
   The three main opposition parties said they will jointly seek to
appoint a special prosecutor to make a thorough investigation of
alleged wrongdoing involving Chun, his family and associates during
Chun's seven-year rule.
   In a report wrapping up nearly a year of investigation, the
prosecution said 47 people have been arrested, including 13 members
of Chun's family, a former intelligence chief, two ex-Cabinet
ministers, a governing party lawmaker and a former Seoul mayor.
   Senior prosecutor Park Chong-chul said 20 others have been
indicted but not detained. No dates for trial were given.
   Those arrested or indicted were charged with embezzlement and
abuse of authority for personal gain, but none was accused of
raising illegal political funds for Chun, a major charge raised by
the opposition.
   Prosecutor General Kim Ki-choon said the prosecution conducted
its investigation in a ``neutral and independent manner.''
   Rep. Lee Sang-soo, spokesman for the largest opposition group,
the Party for Peace and Democracy, said the report showed the
prosecution took its cue from President Roh Tae-woo and did not look
into alleged wrongdoing by Chun.
   Roh, who has carried out broad reform and sought to distance
himself from Chun, has opposed punishment for the authoritarian
former president, saying it would amount to retaliation.
   Suh Chung-won, spokesman for the No. 2 opposition group, the
Reunification Democratic Party, also accused the government of a
coverup and called for the appointment of a special prosecutor.
   Chun, 58, who left office last February, denied any personal
corruption, but he surrendered $24 million in political funds before
going into rural exile in November.
   Radical students and dissidents have demonstrated frequently in
recent months, demanding that Chun be punished on charges of
corruption and human rights violations.
   About 50 radical students, shouting anti-Chun and anti-U.S.
slogans, hurled dozens of firebombs at the U.S. cultural center in
Kwangju, an opposition stronghold 180 miles southwest of Seoul.
   The U.S. Embassy in Seoul reported no casualties or property
damage. Local news reports said about 100 South Korean riot police
guarding the center fired tear gas and chased the attackers away in
a few minutes.
   Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Embassy in Seoul denied reports it
decided to close the Kwangju center but said it could be shut down
after more attacks, of which there were 26 since 1981 and six last
year alone.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the
United States has been seeking promises from South Korean
authorities that they would provide adequate protection for the
Kwangju center and its staff.

<HEAD>Judge Says Jurors' Familiarity with North Poses `Triability' Problem</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates in top 8 grafs with seven in jury pool, North lawyers'
objections, request for sequestering, picking up in 8th graf pvs, John
Keker,</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The judge in Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial
chose seven people for possible jury duty during Tuesday's long
opening day but said there could be problems with the ``triability
of the case'' because so many potential jurors had seen or read of
North's testimony in congressional hearings.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said only 16 of the first
54 prospective jurors indicated on questionnaires that they weren't
exposed to North's congressional appearances in which he supplied
details about misleading Congress and shredding documents. The
former White House aide testified to House and Senate investigating
committees in 1987 under a grant of limited immunity from
prosecution.
   North's lawyers, who contend an impartial jury cannot be
empaneled, objected as Gesell's picked the first seven people for a
pool from which the jury might eventually be chosen. The selection
process will continue Wednesday.
   Defense lawyers also filed a motion asking that ``in the event a
jury can be empaneled, it should be sequestered immediately to
minimize the potential for exposure to immunized testimony and to
protect Lt. Col. North's constitutional rights.''
   One of those in the pool of prospective jurors, a retired postal
clerk, said she paid as much attention to North's televised
testimony as she paid to ``the three Stooges.'' She said her house
had burned down and she was occupied at the time of North's
congressional testimony with itemizing household items that had been
lost in the blaze.
   Still, North's lawyers objected to her selection, noting she said
she turned on a TV set during North's testimony but said in her
questionnaire she had seen none of the hearings.
   Another ordered into the jury pool was an unemployed man looking
for work as a security guard who said he saw North on television
during the congressional hearings but knew nothing about him.
Attorney Barry Simon objected to the selection, saying that ``if he
heard even one'' small portion of North's testimony, ``which he very
easily could have,'' he should be disqualified.
   Gesell also heard arguments on how exposure to North's earlier
testimony should affect qualification or disqualification of other
potential jurors.
   John Keker, the head of the prosecution team, argued that the
question should be whether a potential juror can be fair and
impartial, not whether the person was exposed to North's testimony.
In that testimony, North detailed instances of misleading Congress
and altering and shredding documents as well as other matters for
which he is now charged with crimes.
   North attorney Simon said anyone who was exposed to North's
testimony should be disqualified, even if the person remembers
nothing about it. Simon said jurors could experience ``sudden
recall'' as the trial progresses and details of the case against
North are presented and that therefore ``all the work is for
naught'' in attempting to select a fair and impartial jury.
   As proceedings began, North, dressed in a dark suit, sat at the
defense table. He had testified to Congress in his ribbon-bedecked
Marine uniform but has since retired from the service.
   North's trial on charges of lying to Congress, shredding evidence
and conspiring to commit tax fraud ``arises following a period of
fairly intense publicity on television, newspapers, magazines''
which will continue, Gesell said.
   He quickly excused the first five prospective jurors after all
said they had been exposed to North's 1987 testimony, in which he
detailed activities in connection with which he is now accused of
crimes.
   North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, also sought to rule out as
jurors anyone who in recent days had seen North's congressional
testimony replayed in news reports as the trial start neared.
   Keker, who heads the prosecution team for independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh, said he wanted to present arguments on the process
of automatically disqualifying prospective jurors because they
thought they might have been exposed to North's testimony.
   The judge said he wanted to consider ``how we're going to deal
with this problem. ... This relates to the triability of the case.''
   Gesell wants to find 50 people out of a pool of 300 who have not
been exposed to the congressional testimony of North or other
witnesses at the congressional hearings.
   Indicted last March, the retired Marine lieutenant colonel and
decorated Vietnam veteran is the first figure in the Iran-Contra
affair to come to trial.
   He could face up to 60 years in prison and $3 million in fines if
convicted of all 12 crimes with which he is charged.
   North is accused of lying to Congress about his role in funneling
money to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels when Congress had banned U.S.
aid to them. He is accused of lying to the attorney general about
his role in giving the Contras millions of dollars in profits from
the Reagan administration's secret arms sales to Iran.
   He also is accused of shredding National Security Council records
and participating in a tax fraud conspiracy in which wealthy donors
would get tax breaks for contributions to the Contras.
   Former National Security Adviser John Poindexter and arms
suppliers Richard Secord and Albert Hakim also face criminal charges
in the case, but are to be tried separately later.

<HEAD>Justice Department to Review State Request on Mexico Drug Info</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Tuesday it will
review a State Department request that it give Mexico information
linking top law enforcement officials in that country to narcotics
trafficking.
   David Runkel, an aide to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
confirmed that the department had received the Jan. 13 letter
written by then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Shultz's letter relayed a request from Mexican President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari for information in U.S. law enforcement files
that might link Mexican officials in his government to illegal drugs.
   The request is expected to be greeted cooly by federal law
enforcement officials who fear that sharing such information with
Mexico could compromise intelligence and endanger the lives of
informants.
   Runkel declined to comment on how the department might respond to
the request, saying only: ``There are some issues'' raised by
Shultz's letter.
   Illegal drug traffic has been a sore subject of U.S.-Mexican
relations over the past few years. U.S. officials, notably some
members of Congress, have accused Mexico of not doing enough to rid
law enforcement agencies of corrupt officials.
   Mexico, for its part, has accused the United States of being the
source of the drug problem, pointing to the deman for illegal drugs
among Americans.

   Severe cold, high wind and blowing and drifting snow moved into
the north-central part of the nation Tuesday, while southerly
breezes from the Gulf of Mexico spread unseasonable warmth across
the central part of the nation.
   At least 39 cities reported record high temperatures for the
date, from Colorado to Ohio and from Fort Worth, Texas, to St.
Cloud, Minn.
   But elsewhere, a blizzard warning was posted through the night
for the eastern slopes of the Rockies in Montana, where East Glacier
had received 6 inches of snow by mid-afternoon and wind gusting up
to 45 mph caused blowing and drifting snow and create very low wind
chill factors.
   Storm warnings and watches also were posted for the rest of
Montana, northern Idaho, Wyoming, northern Colorado, northeastern
North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota.
   Elsewhere, snow fell over parts of the Northwest, including the
Cascade Mountains of Washington state and the mountains of Oregon,
and a winter storm watch was posted for northwestern Oregon.
   A few showers were scattered across New York state and Vermont.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 20
degrees below zero at Cut Bank, Mont., to 82 at Fort Myers and
Naples, Fla. Tuesday morning's low for the Lower 48 states was 19
degrees below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Wednesday, snow was forecast over the mountains of the
Pacific Northwest through the northern high Plains to Upper
Michigan, accompanied by strong, gusty wind over the northern
Plains. Scattered showers were forecast from the central Pacific
Coast through the mid Mississippi Valley to New England.
   Highs remaining below freezing were predicted from the central
Rockies through Nebraska and the Dakotas to Upper Michigan,
including highs remaining below zero across Montana and North
Dakota; above 50 from the southern and central coast of California
through the southern half of the Plains to the Atlantic Coast, as
far north as southern New England; and in the 70s and lower 80s over
much of the area from the southern Plains to the southern Atlantic
Coast.

   Bill Schreiber wasn't warning motorists about
just any chuckhole in the street outside his office.
   To prove it, he and others stood in the downtown street lowering
a 10-foot pole completely into the opening as startled motorists
veered away.
   City workers barricaded three of four lanes of Boulder Avenue
south of downtown Tuesday morning after officials were informed of
the two manhole-sized holes that opened into a cavern big enough for
a car.
   A storm sewer cave-in apparently was to blame, officials said.
   Schreiber, a systems analyst at Mid-Continent Casualty Co., said
he saw a car hit one of the holes Monday evening.
   He then walked into the street to divert traffic, at times
lowering his briefcase into one of the holes to demonstrate its
wheel-damaging potential.
   Someone else found a 10-foot-long pipe to illustrate the problem
for motorists.
   ``That was kind of fun,'' Schreiber said. ``We'd hold the pipe up
standing on the pavement, and then drop it. When it all disappeared,
they got the idea pretty quickly.''

   In the battle to sell military hardware,
a small Texas company is about to fire a most unusual shot _ an ad
that features a whiff of war.
   BEI Defense Systems is promoting its ``extraordinarily lethal''
Flechette rockets with scratch-and-sniff advertisements in trade
publications.
   The ads, emblazoned with the slogan ``The Smell of Victory,''
release the smell of cordite, the aroma that follows a rocket
explosion.
   George Coutoumanos, director of U.S. government programs for BEI,
came up with the idea in an effort to draw attention to his firm,
which is small by defense industry standards. Last year, the rocket
and electronics manufacturer handled about $47 million in defense
contracts.
   Coutoumanos said he believes the ads, to be reproduced next
month, will be a first among defense contractors although perfume
manufacturers make regular use of such ads.
   ``My advertising usually gets lost in magazines,'' Coutoumanos
said. ``I usually get buried by the big guys _ the Boeings and the
General Dynamics. Who's going to read my ad when they can look at a
beautiful F-16 going over the countryside?''
   Coutoumanos said defense advertising is a tough line to develop,
because everything tends to look the same. He says posing pretty
women alongside sleek rockets doesn't impress those looking to buy
military hardware.
   Specifically, Coutoumanos is trying to persuade U.S. military
buyers and other defense hardware shoppers that his $400-$800
rockets are a better value than other, more high-profile missiles,
such as the Stingers.
   ``I'd really like to hire a major star and get them to sing and
dance, but it doesn't work that way,'' Coutoumanos said. ``And
shooting off rockets on television isn't really appropriate, I
think.''
   Coutoumanos said the ad will appear first in the Feb. 1
international editions of the Armed Forces Journal, then later run
in Jane's monthly magazine in time for the Paris Air Show.
   ``Next year, I'm going to do the `Sound of Victory.' You're going
to run your thumbnail across some kind of strip and you will hear
the explosions.''

<HEAD>Ledwig Re-Elected CPB Head, Sets Priorities in Budget Fight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Donald E. Ledwig was re-elected president and
chief executive officer of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting
on Tuesday, and urged public broadcasters to join together to fight
for money from Congress.
   The election of the 51-year-old Ledwig, who has held the position
since July 1987, took place at the CPB board meeting in San Juan,
Puerto Rico, the CPB said.
   The board also discussed CPB's proposed operating budget for
fiscal year 1990. The budget calls for $254.3 million for public
broadcasting purposes.
   The budget, which will be voted on at the board's March meeting,
calls for increasing to $9 million program funds for independent
producers and minorities.
   In all, Congress has designated $233 million in fiscal year 1990
for CPB, a private, non-profit corporation that develops
non-commercial radio and television services.
   President Reagan's fiscal 1990 budget proposal, which includes
CPB funds for the following two years, calls for $242 million in
fiscal year 1991 and a freeze on spending in 1992.
   Reagan's budget calls for elimination of funds for the Star
Schools satellite delivery program operated by the Satellite
Educational Resources Consortium.
   His budget also calls for no additional funds to replace an aging
satellite that delivers programs to public radio and TV stations.
   Ledwig said Tuesday he would urge Congress this spring to fully
fund CPB's fiscal 1992 authorization of $265 million and to free the
remainder of the $200 million authorized for the satellite's
replacement.
   Ledwig told Congress last year that unless the satellite is
replaced, the skies will go dark for public stations that rely on it
to receive programming from the Public Broadcasting Service.
   At its meeting Tuesday, the board also re-elected Paul E.
Symczak, vice president, general counsel and secretary; Frederick L.
DeMarco, vice president and treasurer; and Rozanne Weissman, vice
president for corporate communications.

   Critic Says He's Seen Tower Inebriated, With Other Women
</TEXT>

INSERTS 2 grafs after 11th graf pvs, `The committee,' with committee continuing

<TEXT>
   A conservative activist testified Tuesday he
has ``on a number of occasions'' seen Defense Secretary-designate
John Tower publicly inebriated and in the company of women other
than his wife.
   But members of the Senate Armed Services Committee said after a
closed session with the witness that he failed to provide specifics
to support his allegation.
   ``I have made enough personal observations of this man here in
Washington to have serious reservations about his moral character,''
Paul Weyrich told the Senate panel, which is conducting Tower's
confirmation hearing.
   Weyrich's comments prompted quick criticism from Sen. Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo., who complained about ``innuendos ... and
insinuations'' against the former Texas senator.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman, suggested any further
discussion of Tower's personal fitness take place in a previously
scheduled afternoon session that was closed to the public.
   Senators emerging from that session sounded unimpressed.
   ``A number of allegations prove to be wrong,'' said Nunn, who
added that the committee is ``continuing to pursue all allegations.''
   ``I heard nothing that you didn't hear in the open session. I
didn't hear anything persuasive to me,'' Wallop said.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said, ``As an old trial lawyer, I would
have to say that most of what I heard has to fall into the hearsay
category, even given the high motives of the witness.''
   Weyrich was unclear if Tower was married on the occasions he saw
him, according to Dixon.
   ``Beyond statements of seeing Senator Tower on a couple of
occasions carrying a little more alcohol than he should have, he
hasn't been able to add anything specific that wasn't hearsay,''
said Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   Tower refused to comment on the allegations or executive session
as he left the committee office.
   The committee has been expected to approve Tower to head the
Defense Department, and there was no immediate indication that
Weyrich's remarks would change that.
   A closed session is scheduled Wednesday morning followed by an
open session on conflict of interest, Nunn said. Asked if the
committee's work would be completed, Nunn responded, ``I hope so.''
   The committee chairman said he was unsure if they would vote this
week on the nomination. Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said he expected a
vote next week.
   Tower was not present when Weyrich took the witness chair and
uttered in public the allegations that had simmered for several
weeks while President Bush was deciding on a candidate to head the
Pentagon.
   ``Over many years, I have encountered the nominee in a condition
lacking sobriety as well as with women to whom he was not married; I
recognize senators' wives because I worked here in the Senate for
many years,'' Weyrich said.
   ``I did encounter this on a number of occasions.''
   Other witnesses also spoke out against the nominee, questioning
Tower's support for the Star Wars defense proposal and his ability
to institute Pentagon reforms in light of his past ties to defense
contractors.
   But it was Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation and a
longtime proponent for the most conservative of Republican causes,
who got the most attention.
   He contended that Bush's transition team received hundreds of
letters criticizing Tower, some containing specific allegations of
moral impropriety against the nominee, but did not bring the letters
to the president's attention. But Weyrich said he never saw the
letters.
   Tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before
his nomination was announced. In divorce papers filed by his second
wife, Lilla Burt Cummings, Tower was accused of ``marital
misconduct.''
   Bush has defended Tower, saying an FBI background check found
nothing that would prevent him from serving as defense secretary.
When he announced the nomination he dismissed ``a lot of rumors that
proved to be groundless.''
   Tower, a 63-year-old Texas Republican, served 24 years in the
Senate, including a tenure as chairman of the Armed Services
Committee from 1981-84.
   Weyrich also criticized Tower's record on the Strategic Defense
Initiative, saying that the nominee sees Star Wars as a ``bargaining
chip'' for negotiations.
   Tower said last week he does not ``believe that we can devise an
umbrella that can protect the entire American population from
nuclear incineration. I think that's unrealistic.'' He said a more
limited system might work but cautioned that ``it remains to be seen
whether that is a realistic objective.''
   William G. Phillips, president of the National Council for
Industrial Defense, questioned Tower's commitment to Pentagon reform
in the wake of last year's Pentagon procurement scandal and the
former senator's ties to defense contractors.
   ``His confirmation would signal to the defense contractor
community that they have little to fear from any meaningful reform
of defense procurement procedures,'' Phillips said.
   ``It would signal that the `revolving door' of Pentagon-defense
contractors relationships was still in vogue,'' he said.
   Tower said last week in two days of testimony that he received
fees of more than $1 million for consulting work for seven defense
contractors, including such industry giants as Rockwell and
Martin-Marietta.
   He promised to implement reform recommendations of a presidential
commission and the Goldwater-Nichols Act.
   William E. Jackson Jr., senior fellow at the Fulbright Institute
of International Relations at the University of Arkansas, accused
Tower of stonewalling Pentagon reforms and said the former senator

   ``I do not see the need for someone associated with a `fire hose'
approach to the defense budget and someone who is mired in the
`revolving door' culture,'' Jackson said.

   The Senate voted unanimous approval Tuesday
evening of Samuel K. Skinner as President Bush's transportation
secretary.
   Skinner, whose confirmation came only hours after a Senate
committee swiftly approved the nomination, said, ``I will work hard
to make all modes of transportation safer, more efficient and less
expensive for the American consumer.''
   He also pledged to work with Congress, the public, transportation
industries and all interested groups to develop a new national
transportation policy ``for the 1990s and beyond.''
   Both Democrats and Republicans on the Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee praised Skinner as an excellent nominee.
The panel took less than five seconds to give unanimous voice-vote
approval to the former federal prosecutor who flies airplanes and
has been running the nation's second-largest transit system in
northern Illinois.
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., praised all of Bush's Cabinet
selections, saying he was ``deeply impressed by the openness,
integrity and the smarts'' of both Skinner and Robert Mosbacher,
whose nomination as commerce secretary also was approved by the
committee.
   On one controversial issue, in written response to a committee
question submitted after last week's hearing, Skinner said he would
review the mileage standards required of automakers for 1990.
   Unless the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration acts,
the standard would increase from 26.5 miles per gallon for 1989 to
27.5 for 1990. The auto industry opposes the tougher standard set
under a federal fuel conservation law.
   Skinner, 50, also promised during his confirmation hearing to
support mandatory drug testing for transportation workers in
safety-related jobs, to combat air terrorism and to push for
fairness to U.S. airlines abroad even if it means putting him at
odds with the State Department.
   He said he would work to build up the Coast Guard and the
maritime industry.
   Skinner, nicknamed ``Sam the Hammer,'' gained a reputation for
toughness as he headed up a special investigative team that
successfully prosecuted former Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner for bribery
in 1973.
   His nomination faced no opposition after the committee cleared
away a brief controversy over Skinner's failure as U.S. attorney to
prosecute a major drug manufacturer.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, had questioned Skinner's failure
to prosecute G.D. Searle Co. on allegations that it falsified test
results on its Nutrasweet artificial sweetener.
   Metzenbaum withdrew his objections after talking with Skinner,
however, and announced his support for the nomination. Skinner told
the committee the decision not to prosecute was made by his
successor but he acknowledged making minor mistakes as he recused
himself from the case and joined the law firm that had represented
Searle.
   Metzenbaum and other committee members said they were convinced
Skinner had acted honorably and honestly in the matter.
   Skinner has been a close associate of Illinois Gov. James R.
Thompson and headed Bush's 1980 and 1988 presidential campaigns in
Illinois.

   A Korean-American businessman charged with
trying to export nerve gas also held classified documents revealing
the United States' capability to intercept enemy communications, the
government disclosed Tuesday.
   Papers filed in U.S. District Court by prosecutors fighting the
release of Juhwan Yun on $2 million bail gave new details on the
documents, which Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Singer earlier said
were found on a desk at Yun's import-export business.
   ``Revelation of the information would not only compromise
specifics of our EW (Electronic Warfare) capabilities but would also
reveal details of our knowledge of enemy threat,'' said a memorandum
written by Navy Capt. M. Oetinger, vice director of the Pentagon's
Joint Electronic Warfare Center, to the U.S. Customs Service.
   Yun was arrested Jan. 12 by U.S. Customs Agents when he arrived
for a meeting with an undercover agent he believed was an arms
dealer.
   After a hearing Monday, U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin
ordered Yun released, saying the government failed to demonstrate
that Yun was a risk to flee. But he stayed his order to give the
government time to appeal the decision.
   After the government filed the new information Tuesday, Sarokin
refused in a late afternoon court hearing to reconsider his
decision, but again stayed the order, until 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, to
give the government time to take the matter to the 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   Ms. Singer has argued that Yun apparently had contacts with
several foreign governments, which would prefer he not stand trial
in the case.
   The government previously has said Yun may have had contacts at
U.S. military installations. The documents filed Tuesday reveal that
those contacts may have been at U.S. bases in other countries.
   Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Arnie Williams said he had reviewed
the government disclosures but declined comment.
   The new information filed alleges that Korean-language documents
marked ``Secret'' and found in Yun's office show how much is known
about an unidentified enemy's electronic signals and gives details
of specialized warfare systems expected for use in the years 1992
and beyond.
   The government's new filings do not say if the documents were
from the South Korean government or if the enemy mentioned was North
Korea.
   The Korean-language documents also discussed electronic
countermeasures, the jamming of enemy signals and the deposition,
numbers and locations of enemy forces, according to the court papers.
   Yun is charged along with a Briton for allegedly plotting to buy
the nerve gas sarin and other military equipment for export.
Authorities have said the nerve gas's possible destination was Iran.
   Richard Cimusz, an FBI counterintelligence agent, said in a new
affidavit filed Tuesday that Yun had been investigated previously
for allegedly trying to obtain other military equipment, including
night-vision equipment, fighter planes and tank parts.
   The government has said Yun boasted of high-level military and
civilian contacts with Yugoslavia, the People's Republic of China
and South Korea.
   Cimusz said that Yun has had contact with officials of two
different countries that ``are of counterintellgnece interest to the
FBI'' and that he had ``official documents from a third country of
counterintelligence interest to the FBI.''

   Authorities say they smashed a drug and
weapons operation by the Sicilian Mafia and right-wing extremists
that included plans to sell French warplanes to Guinea-Bissau in
West Africa.
   Newspapers said Tuesday at least 48 people had been arrested.
   At a news conference Monday, authorities said 72 arrest warrants
were issued on charges of criminal association and trafficking in
arms and drugs for suspects in Italy and abroad, including the
United States and Switzerland. Names of suspects living outside
Italy were not disclosed.
   La Stampa, a Turin daily, said the investigation also extended to
Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile and Nigeria.
   Judge Alba Dova issued the warrants in Massa Carrara, a Tuscan
coastal city where the investigation was coordinated for more than a
year.
   Dova said the link between the Mafia and right-wing terrorists
``leads one to think of the existence of an international extremist
right wing political organization that finances itself through
illegal financial operations and ties with organized crime.''
   Much of the illegal traffic was said to have been arranged
through two Italian import-export companies.
   Other illegal activities included trafficking in stolen art, cars
and foreign currency. Some of the money was allegedly recycled
through coded Swiss bank accounts.
   A key figure in the warrants is Marco Affatigato, a reputed
leader of Nuova Ordine (New Order), which is accused of several
terrorist attacks in Italy in the 1970s and early 1980s.
   Affatigato is believed to be in France. Whether he had been
arrested was not known.
   Among Mafia suspects caught in raids Monday were members of the
Corleone family, considered Sicily's most powerful Mafia clan, and
of the Minore family from Trapani, a port in western Sicily linked
to clandestine drug and arms shipments.
   The man thought to be the Corleone ``cashier,'' Michele Cillari,
was among better-known figures arrested.
   Judge Dova said the investigation stemmed from the discovery of
arms and drugs in 1987 on a Lebanese ship off Italy's Adriatic
coast. The ship, from Beirut, carried heroin, hashish, an anti-tank
bazooka, Soviet grenade-launcher and other arms, authorities said.
   Police initially linked the shipment to alleged smuggling of arms
between Italy and the Middle East, including clandestine delivery of
mines to Iran. Several Italian industrialists and arms manufacturers
were arrested, but they were freed later and the charges dropped.
   On Monday, officials said documents seized in connection with the
ship _ including false certificates of a dummy ``Canadian Credit
Bank'' of Detroit _ put them on the trail of the Mafia-terrorist
operation.
   The gang allegedly plotted to deliver French Mirage jets to
Guinea-Bissau, acting as middlemen in return for kickbacks.
   An Italian representative of the African country and an official
of the French manufacturer, Dassault-Breguet, identified only as Mr.
Covanschi, also were said to be involved. Whether planes were
delivered was not clear.

   Somali Prime Minister Mohamed Ali Samater said
Tuesday his government has taken a series of steps designed to
achieve peace and prosperity internally and to improve relations
with its neighbors.
   Samater spoke in an interview at the outset of a visit partly
aimed at refuting allegations that Somalia has engaged in widespread
human rights abuses while attempting to put down an insurrection in
the northern part of the country.
   The United States has imposed sharp cutbacks in aid to Somalia as
has the United Nations and Great Britain. An Australian-based aid
agency pulled out of Somalia three weeks ago, citing political
repression.
   But Samater said, ``Our position is that we have not committed
human rights abuses.''
   Samater's visit is part of a diplomatic offensive the Somali
government has initiated in an effort to bolser its international
image. He will meet with Assistant Secretary of State Chester
Crocker on Wednesday and also plans consultations on Capitol Hill.
   As evidence of Somalia's new approach, Samatar said all political
prisoners, numbering between 200 and 250, are being released and
that steps have been taken to ensure that persons detained on
suspicion of criminal conduct have a prompt judicial proceeding.
   He also said that state controls over the economy are being eased
in order to revitalize the country's productive capacity. In
addition, he said the government is willing to move toward a
political settlement with the northern-based insurgency.
   Somalia has enjoyed close political and military ties with the
United States for years but many in Congress were appalled last year
over a reported dramatic increase in human rights abuses. Under
congressional pressure, the administration placed a hold on about
$55 million in economic assistance.
   Holly Burkhalter, who monitors the rights situation in Somalia in
her role as associate director of Human Rights Watch, a private
group, disputed Samatar's account about the situation in Somalia.
   ``It's very, very serious indeed,'' she said. ``The fact that
nearly half a million Somalians left their country for the dubious
privilege of refuge in Ethiopia says more than anything else about
human rights conditions in Somalia.''
   In addition, the United Nations last month decided to withhold
food aid from an estimated 400,000 Ethiopian refugees in Somalia,
contending that Somalian authorities were using the Ethiopians for
military activities. A U.S. official said the U.N. finding had been
corroborated in interviews with eyewitnesses.
   But Samatar said the U.N.'s own figures show that 77 per cent of
the Ethiopian refugees are women or children and that the rest are
too aged to fight.
   ``Only a small percentage is able bodied,'' he said.

<HEAD>16 Hangings; Four Tehran Radio Execs Jailed For Insulting Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran hanged 16 more people for various
crimes and sentenced four Tehran Radio executives to jail Tuesday
for a program that insulted Islam, official news reports said.
   Ten women and one man were hanged Tuesday in the northwestern
Iranian provinces of Zanjan and Markazi after they ``confessed to
setting up dens of corruption and adultery,'' the Islamic Republic
News Agency said, without elaborating.
   The hanging verdicts were issued by the local Islamic courts, and
confirmed by the Judicial High Council, said IRNA, monitored in
Nicosia.
   Earlier, IRNA reported five Afghan nationals, convicted of
robbery and rape, were hanged publicly Monday in the northeastern
city of Mashhad.
   They were convicted of 13 charges brought against them, including
armed robberies, rape and ``terrorizing people,'' IRNA said without
giving details.
   The London-based Amnesty International, which monitors human
rights, on Monday called for international efforts to pressure Iran
into halting what it described as a six-month campaign of political
executions.
   It said about 1,000 people were executed during that period.
   Iran's media, which is tightly controlled by the government, has
reported few political executions in the past few months. But it has
said some 132 drug smugglers have been executed this month as part
of an anti-narcotics crackdown.
   Tehran Radio's broadcast director, Mohammad Arab Mazar-Yazdi, was
sentenced by the Penal Court to five years in jail, and three other
executives were sentenced to four years plus 50 lashes after a
Saturday broadcast that offended Islam and angered Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, IRNA said.
   IRNA did not say what exactly angered the patriarch of the
Islamic revolution. But it said the episode of the daily program
``Family'' was devoted to the role of women in Islamic society on
the occasion of the birthday of Fatima Zahra, the daughter and only
child of Prophet Mohammed, the founder of Islam.
   Khomeini wrote to the managing director of radio and television,
Mohammad Hashemi, on Sunday demanding that those responsible for
airing Saturday's episode of a daily program called ``Family'' be
sacked and punished.
   In the letter, text of which was carried by IRNA on Monday,
Khomeini said: ``If proven that there was a deliberate insult,
undoubtedly the person who has made the insult receives a death
sentence.''
   He also warned that if such an incident was repeated the entire
adminstrative body of the radio and television ``will be severely
punished.''
   The other three executives sentenced were Mahmoud Abulqasemi,
director of Islamic ideology; Hamid Khunmeri, head of supervision;
and Mohammad Rasekh, editor of ideological programs, IRNA said.

   The United Mine Workers, complying Tuesday with
a request by governors in three coal-producing states, dropped a
strike deadline and said its 1,700 workers at Pittston Coal Group
mines would continue working without a contract.
   At the same time, the union expanded its effort to pressure
Pittston through protests and other actions aimed at the company's
business partners, announcing a boycott of Virginia-based Crestar
Financial Corp. and its banks.
   Despite the decision not to strike at midnight Tuesday, union
president Richard L. Trumka had harsh words for Pittston management
and said he was ``not overly optimistic'' an agreement would be
reached in the next 30 to 60 days, the extension period requested by
the governors of Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
   Trumka accused Pittston officials of failing to bargain seriously
and of trying to break the union.
   Pittston thanked the union for its action and, meeting a
longstanding UMW request, said its chief executive officer, Paul
Douglas, would accept Trumka's invitation for a face-to-face
meeting. UMW officials have sought the meeting because they contend
company negotiators do not have the power to make concessions.
   Pittston Coal Group President Michael Odom suggested the two
sides ask the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to
intervene in the talks and promised the company would ``exert every
effort to assure that the time during the cooling off period is
utilized effectively to achieve a settlement.''
   Govs. Gaston Caperton of West Virginia and Wallace Wilkinson of
Kentucky hailed the decision to postpone a strike and urged both
sides to reach agreement on a contract. Virginia Gov. Gerald
Baliles, through a spokeswoman, expressed similar sentiments.
   Trumka said Crestar's decision to give Pittston a loan in
December 1987 amounted to helping the company build a strike fund.
The union's contract expired less than two months later and the
miners have been working without a contract since then.
   Union action against the bank, Trumka said, began with the
withdrawal of $29.7 million _ $23 million by the Bakery and
Confectionary Union and Industry International Pension Fund and $6.7
million by the UMW.
   Crestar spokesman Neil Cotiaux said the bank regretted the union
action and considered it to be unfair. ``Crestar has no dispute with
union or its members,'' Cotiaux said in a statement. ``Our
participation in the credit arrangement with Pittston is an
extension of previous credit arrangements.''
   Pittston Coal Group, based in Lebanon, Va., is a subsidiary of
The Pittston Co. of Greenwich, Conn. Pittson last February refused
to sign a wage agreement the miners union negotiated with other
major eastern coal producers.
   Over the past week, the company has been considering a union
offer made a week ago in response to an offer Pittston made in
November. Pension and health benefits are the major sticking points
in the talks, union officials said.
   Pittston has said it planned to operate its mines in the event of
the strike and possibly would hire permanent replacements.

   An Argentine ship which ran aground off the
Antarctic Peninsula has floated free, and a leak of diesel fuel that
was threatening penguins and other wildlife has stopped, National
Science Foundation spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday.
   But the ship, from which all passengers and crew members have
been evacuated, is in danger of sinking.
   Renerie said the vessel is taking on water, is down at the stern
where water is up to the first deck, and is heeled over 25 degrees.
   Two Argentine vessels were headed to the vessel to try to pump
the remaining fuel from the ship and salvage it if possible, but it
remained in danger of sinking and had drifted against a nearby
island, he said.
   In Argentina, the government news agency Telam reported that the
ship, the Bahia Paraiso, would probably be towed to Rio Gallegos,
Argentina to be repaired.
   Telam quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: ``The fuel it
carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steel
drums so a spill is practically impossible.''
   The ship, a 400-foot-long double-hulled vessel, ran aground
Saturday about two miles from Palmer Station, a U.S. research
facility which is located about 600 miles south of Cape Horn, the
tip of South America.
   The 316 people aboard, including 82 passengers and 234 crew
members, were rescued by power boats and taken to Palmer Station.
The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the
South Shetland Islands, from which they were airlifted to the South
American mainland Sunday. But 104 crewmen remain at the station,
said Renerie.
   Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been
rationed to two meals a day, said a NSF statement.
   The crewmen will remain until the two Argentine salvage vessels
are expected arrive Thursday or Friday, the statement said.
   The ship sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and some of
the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing ashore
near Palmer station.
   The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a
vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and has affected penguins,
sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the statement said.
   There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the
wildlife in the pristine surroundings.
   ``Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may
already have been affected by the leak,'' the NSF statement said.
   The ship was carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline and
canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station
near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, it said.

<HEAD>Jury Hears Case on Earrings Made of Human Fetuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury at the Old Bailey criminal court will decide
whether earrings made of human fetuses are art or obscenity.
   Exhibit One, in a glass case, is a mannequin's head with a black
curly wig, a scarf and a pair of human fetuses, of three to four
months' gestation and freeze-dried, attached to its ears.
   Police seized the head Dec. 1, 1987, opening day of an exhibition
of 40 items at the Young Unknowns art gallery in Waterloo, south
London. The show was called In Animal.
   Canadian sculptor Richard Gibson, 36, the creator, and gallery
owner Peter Sylveire, 43, were charged with outraging public decency
and causing a nuisance.
   They pleaded innocent, and this week a jury of 10 women and two
men began listening to lawyers argue whether the work is art or
outrage.
   Geoffrey Robertson, who represents Sylveire and sees the case as
an important test of obscenity laws, said in court Monday one
purpose of art is ``to shock and jolt the public from its
complacency.''
   He said the fetal sculpture could be seen as demonstrating that
``women wear abortions as lightly as they wear their earrings.''
   Prosecutor Michael Worsley said Tuesday the issue was not
artistic merit or lack of it, but whether the earrings would shock,
disgust or revolt a decent member of the public.
   He declared the fetuses, which were obtained from a pathology
lecturer, to be an outrage to public decency.
   Sylveire was said to have told a journalist at the gallery he did
not think the earrings were ``any more immoral than sculptors using
human hair.''
   Gibson said he found the police reaction ``over the top'' _ too
extreme.
   Worsley told the jury Gibson ``saw nothing wrong with his work,
but said that some people might have a moral objection to it.''
   Britain legalized abortion in 1967, and the law allows abortions
up to the 28th week of pregnancy.

   Maoist guerrillas shot a police commander to
death as he walked on a dark street in an Andes mining town,
officials reported Tuesday.
   Six gunmen killed Cesar Chavez Vila on Monday night while he was
vacationing in Cerro de Pasco, a mining town 120 miles northwest of
Huancayo, police said.
   Chavez Vila commanded the national police detachment in Huancayo,
the Junin state capital and an important trading center for the
central Andes. It is 140 miles east of Lima.
   Guerrillas of the Shining Path movement have increased attacks in
the area recently. Officials say the rebels want to cause economic
chaos by disrupting mine production and delivery of agricultural
products from the central Andes to Lima.
   More than 12,000 people have been killed in political violence,
most of them peasants in the Andes, since the Shining Path began its
guerrilla campaign in 1980.

<HEAD>Administration Tells Of Dialogue With Saudis For Jet Fighters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has told Congress it
may seek permission to sell more than 100 F@A-18 fighter jets to
Saudi Arabia if the Saudis want the planes, sources said Tuesday.
   The possibility was raised in a cover letter to a classified list
of proposed foreign arms sales submitted to the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee last month.
   The annual list details possible U.S. arms sales. For each
large-scale sale, Capitol Hill must be notified and Congress then
has 60 days to block the deal.
   The letter left open the possibility the administration will
notify Congress during the coming year of its intent to sell Saudi
Arabia the F-18s, but the letter doesn't commit the United States to
such a sale.
   The list was compiled by the Reagan White House and could be
changed by the new administration.
   The list includes the sale to Saudi Arabia of M1-A tanks and
multiple rocket launchers. Most of those items are not expected to
be controversial, said the sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Saudi Arabia has told the United States it is still shopping
around Europe for alternatives to the F-18, such as the French
Mirage 2000 or a fighter jet produced by a joint British-French
venture, the sources said.
   The Saudi decision may only come next year, once all the European
models are available, they said. The Saudis are not in a rush to
make the decision because the new jets are designed as replacement
for its current U.S. fleet of F-5s and F-15s, which is good at least
until 1995.
   While the Europeans are offering the Saudis better financial
terms than the United States, the Saudis are still attracted by the
quality of U.S. aircraft, which have been the mainstay of their
arsenal, and the pilot training program offered by the United
States, the sources said.
   The Saudis are also seeking to avoid an embarrassing fight with
Congress over such a sale, which many on Capitol Hill oppose.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., last month put the administration
on notice he would try to block an F-18 sale on the grounds it
endangers Israel. The two nations are technically still in a state
of war.
   The Reagan and Bush administrations have both argued that
persistent congressional rejections of such aircraft sales have
driven the Saudis to look elsewhere, at the expense of U.S.
businesses and foreign policy interests.

   The Soviet Union will withdraw 10,000
soldiers in 22 units from Hungary by the end of next year, Soviet
military officers told reporters Tuesday.
   A total of 50,000 troops will be withdrawn from Hungary,
Czechoslovakia and East Germany under a plan announced by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In Hungary, the units include a full tank division, a training
tank regiment, an airborne assault battalion, a fighter aircraft
group and a chemical defense battalion, the Soviet officers said.
   Col. Gen. Matvei Burlakov, commander of the Soviet southern army
group stationed in Hungary, said the withdrawal would reduce the
strength of the southern army group by 10,000 troops, including
2,400 officers. Soviet troop strength in Hungary now is 62,000.
   Burlakov said the troops will be withdrawn from the Austrian
border.
   More than 2,200 artillery pieces and trench mortars, 450 tanks
and more than 3,000 motor vehicles will be withdrawn in stages
beginning in May or June, he said.
   Eleven Soviet garrisons will be disbanded and the facilities
handed over to the Hungarians, including 900 apartments and 19
barracks, he said.

   Democrat Bernard Aronson has been chosen by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III for the key post of assistnat
secretary for inter-American affairs, congressional sources said
Tuesday.
   A Democratic Senate source, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, said Aronson was picked because he is a moderate who can
appeal to both Democrats and Republicans on divisive Central
American policies, particularly Nicaragua.
   But the appointment may provoke controversy among some
congressional liberals because Aronson once helped lobby Congress on
behalf of a military aid package for the Contra rebels fighting
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   ``I think it's more than just a trial balloon,'' said Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum, R-Kan., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
   Aronson emerged from a group that included at least two other
contenders to succeed Elliott Abrams in the job. Abrams became the
lightning rod for the Reagan admistration's Nicaragua policy, the
longest-running dispute with Congress of Reagan's presidency.
   Baker had reportedly also been considering Robert C. Helander, a
New York attorney, and Deane R. Hinton, U.S. ambassador to Costa
Rica, but both were objectionable to conservatives who saw them as
not sufficiently devoted to the Contras.
   Aronson had met in recent days with both House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, and paid courtesy calls to other congressional leaders on
Tuesday.
   Aronson, a former speechwriter for Walter F. Mondale, now is a
member of a Council on Foreign Relations study group on Central
America.
   When the Reagan administration was trying to sell a Contra aid
package on Capitol Hill in 1986, Aronson joined a group of other
liberals to help and wrote a speech for Reagan that admitted Contra
human rights violations and sought to condition military aid for the
rebels on improving their human rights record.
   ``I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to work
together,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., who visited with
Aronson and said the appointee spoke in support of the regional
peace plan drawn up by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu offered a public vote
of confidence Tuesday for James A. Baker III, saying the new
secretary of state is open to new ideas and ``not dogmatic'' in
discussions with church leaders pressing for sanctions against the
white-ruled government of South Africa.
   ``I don't want to be euphoric, but we certainly have been
impressed,'' said the Nobel Peace Prize winner, who flew to
Washington for the early-evening meeting between Baker and a
delegation sponsored by the World Council of Churches.
   Tutu said Baker made no promises, but indicated the new
administration is reviewing its policy toward South Africa.
   Asked to compare his first meeting with Baker and past sessions
with former Secretary of State George Shultz, Tutu said:
   ``I was very impressed by the fact that he was not dogmatic, he
actually was discussing with the group and was interested in any
initiative that the United States might actively take to pressure
the South African government to the negotiating table.''
   ``They are ... involved in a review process. He did not dismiss
us, he listened to us with very considerable interest,'' Tutu said
after the half-hour session at the State Department.
   Tutu joined a delegation that has been on a three-week tour of
the United States, several West European capitals and Japan to
convince government officials to take a stronger stand against South
Africa and its policy of apartheid.
   The archbishop said the delegation asked Baker to consider the
imposition of more economic sanctions against South Africa as a
means of pressuring the white-rule government to abolish apartheid.
   Tutu stressed, however, the real appeal to Baker was made as an
appeal against racial injustice.
   ``More than anything else, the call of the delegation (was) that
the United States had to take a moral leadership in what is a moral
issue facing the world,'' Tutu said.
   In 1986, Congress imposed sanctions against South Africa despite
a veto by then-President Reagan, putting in place a ban on new loans
and investments, a prohibition of the importation of South African
coal and other materials, and halting direct U.S.-South African air
links.
   The group of church leaders, formally known as the Eminent Church
Persons Group of the World Council of Churches, is composed of
Metropolitan Paulos Mr Gregorios, India; Rev. Canaan Banana,
Zimbabwe; Elaine Hesse Greif, New Zealand, World YWCA general
secretary; Lysaneas Maciel, Brazil, Brazil National Assembly federal
deputy and Ministry of Labor legal counselor; Lucille Mair,
Trinidad, University of the West Indies; Rev. Carl Mau, Washington,
D.C., former Lutheran World Federation general secretary.

   A Soviet Jewish scientist who disappeared in
Paris and was reported as a defector by French diplomats has arrived
in Israel, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
   ``All I can say is that Mr. Yakov Kogan has arrived in Israel a
few days ago. I am not aware of the circumstances of his arrival,''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said.
   French diplomatic sources said Tuesday that Kogan, a member of
the Soviet Academy of Sciences who had been in Paris for a seminar
on telecommunications, dropped from sight over the weekend and was
seeking asylum in Israel.
   Liel declined comment about Kogan's reported defection and said
he did not know where Kogan arrived from.
   Radio Shalom, a Jewish FM station in Paris, said Kogan is a
mathematician who participated in a seminar sponsored by the French
Foreign Ministry and disappeared Sunday. He was to have returned to
the Soviet Union on Tuesday.
   Israel Television quoted French sources as saying Kogan
approached Israeli representatives in Paris last week in a ``direct
or indirect way.''
   It said the Israelis consulted with the Foreign Ministry in
Jerusalem and decided that their consulate in Paris would issue a
tourist visa for Kogan, a standard procedure for every Jew who asks
to immigrate to Israel.
   Immediately afterwards, officials of the Jewish Agency ordered a
plane ticket for Kogan, again a customary procedure regarding a Jew
who cannot fund a ticket, the television said.
   There was no immediate response from the Soviet Union, which cut
diplomatic ties with Israel following the 1967 Middle East war.
Israel has demanded the right of free emigration for every Jew
wishing to live in the Jewish state.

   The Soviet Embassy on Tuesday denied
allegations by Sweden's naval chief that Soviet submarines continue
to intrude into Swedish waters.
   Embassy spokesman Anatoly Novikov was quoted by Swedish radio as
saying Soviet captains ``have been ordered not to come any closer to
Swedish territorial waters than 30 kilometers,'' about 19 miles.
   Sweden says it has evidence of about 40 violations of its waters
a year, but efforts to catch an intruder or force a sub to the
surface have failed.
   Admiral Bengt Schuback charged Monday that Soviet submarines from
secret Baltic bases keep violating Swedish waters.
   ``They can't come from anywhere but hidden bases in the Baltic,
and we know Western countries have no such bases,'' he said at a
military seminar.
   But his superior, Torsten Engberg, chief of the defense staff,
told the seminar that ``there is not enough evidence to identify any
nationality.''
   Last week the navy said it ``had indications'' that a submarine
had penetrated waters outside Stockholm. ``Indications'' usually
refer to tracks on the seabed left by mini-subs, sightings of a
periscope by fishermen or sonar signals.
   Sweden has not officially accused any nation of violations since
1983, when the government protested Soviet incursions to Moscow. Two
years earlier a Soviet submarine ran aground a naval base in
southern Sweden.

   Officials confirmed Tuesday that the woman who
claims in Penthouse magazine that she performed sexual acts for
television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart has a string of arrests in the
New Orleans area.
   Swaggart's attorneys distributed documents showing that Catherine
Mary Kampen had been arrested in Orleans, Jefferson and St. Bernard
parishes on various charges, including theft and issuing bad checks.
   The documents were distributed at a news conference Monday during
which Swaggart vehemently denied knowing Kampen and threatened to
sue the magazine.
   Kampen, a 38-year-old stripper, claims in the March issue of
Penthouse that she was Swaggart's ``sex slave'' for six months. The
magazine quotes Kampen as saying Swaggart demanded that she perform
sadomasochistic and degrading acts.
   Swaggart was defrocked by the Assemblies of God last year and saw
his international ministries rocked by allegations that he paid a
New Orleans prostitute to perform sex acts for him. He confessed at
that time to an unspecified sin but never discussed the accusations
made by the prostitute, Debra Murphree.
   On Monday, Swaggart accused Penthouse of trying to destroy his
ministry through a ``diabolical and slanderous'' story.
   ``Feel free to publish anything you like,'' Swaggart warned the
magazine at a news conference Monday, ``but be prepared to back it
up in court.''
   Penthouse Publisher Bob Guccione said in a statement Monday that
he stood behind the story.
   Penthouse spokesman Sy Presten said the terms of Kampen's
contract with the magazine prevented her from talking to the press,
but ``we're working on setting up a press conference next week.''
   Kampen's arrest record is mentioned in passing in the Penthouse
article. Art Harris, who wrote the piece, said the arrests were
minor.
   ``You wouldn't expect someone who got into this situation to have
the background of a nun,'' he said Tuesday.
   Harris refused to comment on charges by Ronda Shear, co-owner of
the strip-tease telegram service that employs Kampen, that the woman
had concocted the story after seeing a Penthouse story on Murphree.
   According to records distributed by Swaggart's lawyers, Kampen
was arrested in Jefferson Parish on Dec. 30, 1986, and charged with
criminal damage to property and theft of under $100. Kampen was
convicted and paid a $200 fine and court costs, said Linda Simpson
of the district attorney's office.
   On Aug. 17, 1973, Kampen was arrested and charged with issuing
worthless checks in St. Bernard Parish. She was given one year's
probation and fined $40.
   Kampen was arrested in New Orleans on Jan. 10, 1972, under the
name of Cathy M. Smith, and charged with using a stolen driver's
license and forged receipt to get $53 from a department store. Court
records confirm she was fined $100 and received a suspended
six-month jail sentence.

<TEXT>
   Witnesses said a daughter of actor John
Wayne is a loving but emotionally immature parent, so a judge plans
to award custody of the late actor's 1-year-old granddaughter to the
girl's father.
   Orange County Superior Court Judge Ronald E. Owen announced his
tentative ruling in a memorandum issued Monday.
   Owen said Aissa Wayne, 32, is unfit for custody of Anastasia
Wayne.
   ``The various mental-health professionals that testified seemed
to have one common thread running through their testimony,'' Owen
said in his ruling. ``That is, that the mother, although loving,
lacks familiarity with the child, is emotionally immature and lacks
direction herself.''
   The judge said he would grant custody of Anastasia to Dr. Thomas
A. Gionis, a Pomona orthopedic surgeon, while allowing Ms. Wayne to
visit every other weekend beginning Feb. 10.
   ``I've spoken to Aissa several times already,'' Gionis said.
``I'm sure we will always remain close for the mutual benefit of the
child.''
   Ms. Wayne shares custody of two children by a previous marriage.
   Gionis' attorney, George L. Stephan, called private
investigators, psychologists and family counselors to testify during
a lengthy hearing to show that Ms. Wayne spent little time with
Anastasia when the girl was home for visits, often leaving the child
to the care of housekeepers.
   In an unrelated development, the spacious Newport Beach estate
where Ms. Wayne and a friend, financier Roger Luby, 52, were bound
and pistol whipped by two intruders last October has been put on the
auction block to pay off the mortgage. The attackers were never
caught.
   The minimum bid on Luby's 7,000-square-foot, six-bedroom house
must be nearly $1.2 million cash in order to pay off the mortgage,
according to a notice of trustee sale filed Jan. 23.

   Convicted killer Ian Lightbourne got a
stay of execution Tuesday, less than 15 hours before he was to die
in the electric chair. A second convicted killer also slated for
execution Wednesday was saved by an earlier stay, and officials were
unsuccessful in getting that ban lifted.
   The state Supreme Court voted to block indefinitely Lightbourne's
execution scheduled for 7 a.m. Wednesday at Florida State Prison
near Starke. Earlier Tuesday, Lightbourne lost an appeal in circuit
court in Ocala.
   Raymond Robert Clark got a stay last week from his scheduled
execution Wednesday. Had both killers gone to the chair, it would
have been the first double execution in Florida in nearly 25 years.
   State Attorney General Bob Butterworth asked the U.S. Supreme
Court to allow Clark's execution to proceed by vacating the stay
granted by the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Clark
was under his fourth death warrant.
   By the end of business Tuesday, however, Carolyn Snurkowski,
chief of death penalty appeals for Butterworth, said she didn't
expect a ruling before Wednesday morning. The warrant authorizing
Clark's execution doesn't expire until Feb. 7.
   The last execution in Florida was Jan. 24 when confessed serial
killer Ted Bundy was put to death for the 1978 kidnap-murder of a
Lake City schoolgirl.
   The last double execution was May 12, 1964, when Sie Dawson and
Emmett Blake died 28 minutes apart.
   Lightbourne, 29, under his second death warrant, was sentenced
for the 1981 murder of Nancy A. O'Farrell, 41, near Ocala.
   Clark, 47, was convicted of the 1977 murder of St. Petersburg
businessman David Drake.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 12th graf, `For the...' to CLARIFY and add that allowing
state-run hospitals to take fee-paying patients also will have effect of
boosting private insurance.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Tuesday proposed the biggest shakeup
in Britain's free health system, boosting private health insurance
and allowing big hospitals to charge fees.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in a statement introducing a
government policy document, called the plan the ``most far-reaching
reform of the National Health Service in its 40-year history.''
   The opposition Labor Party, which introduced free health care
after World War II, accused her Conservative government of setting
out to wreck the system.
   The changes will be drafted later as a parliamentary bill that is
assured of passage by the Conservative-dominated Parliament. They
are expected to be in operation within the next three years.
   The plan was seen by some as an attempt to borrow from the
American health system, with its emphasis on private care, without
increasing spending.
   ``In other words, excellent care, eventually, for perhaps as much
as three-tenths of the population, but deteriorating health care for
the remainder,'' said Dr. David Owen, a physician who leads the
centrist Social Democratic Party.
   Government officials said the reforms would streamline the health
bureaucracy and give the public wider choice, while denying no one
access to free treatment.
   It was a ``change of pace, rather than a change of direction,''
said Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke.
   ``The National Health Service is and must remain open to all
regardless of income, financed mainly out of general taxation,'' he
told the House of Commons.
   Under the plan, the 320 biggest and most sophisticated of the
2,000 state-run hospitals in Britain can become self-governing in
1991, taking fee-paying private patients and billing local
authorities for the others.
   Breaking another post-war tradition, the self-governing hospitals
will charge patients for extras such as choice of meals, private
telephones or television.
   For the first time, too, private health insurance for the
elderly, who are the biggest burden on the state system, will be
tax-deductible. Allowing the state-run hospitals to take in
fee-paying patients also will have the effect of boosting private
health insurance.
   Self-governing hospitals will be able to attract higher quality
staff, from consultants to cleaners, by setting their own pay scales.
   Other changes planned over three years include fining general
practitioners who resort too readily to prescibing medicines.
   Family doctors with big practices will get separate state budgets
to buy drugs and hospital treatment from private, state or
self-governing hospitals for elective surgery. They will be allowed
to keep half of any savings on the drugs budget.
   Consultants and general practitioners will have their costs
independently audited and, like hospitals, will be encouraged to
compete for patients.
   Labor's parliamentary spokesman on health, Robin Cook, said the
plan was the work ``of people who will always put a healthy balance
sheet before healthy patients.''
   Left-wing health workers' unions were outraged.
   Rodney Bickerstaffe, leader of the biggest health union _ the
National Union of Public Service Employees _ described the proposals
as a ``cynical charter'' to replace the NHS with ``a commercial
circus.''
   ``Treatment will be price-tagged, leaving the poor, the
chronically sick and the elderly out in the cold. Sick people will
be shunted round the country in a scramble for the cheapest care,''
said Bickerstaffe.
   The National Health Service, which with a staff of 1 million is
second only to the Soviet army as the biggest employer in Europe,
has been a major frustration for Mrs. Thatcher since she won power
in 1979.
   Mrs. Thatcher insists on her right to private health treatment
``at the time I want and with the doctor I want.'' She argues it is
pointless to throw more money at the National Health Service without
increasing its efficiency.
   The service, used by 90 percent of the population, is popular
with voters and Mrs. Thatcher has held back from exposing it to her
strategy of rolling back the frontiers of socialism.
   Instead, spending has increased in real terms by nearly one-third
since 1979 to $38.7 billion a year.
   But the enduring public image is of a system subjected to budget
cuts by the Thatcher administration in which children die waiting
for heart surgery.
   Waiting lists persist partly because demand is limitless and
treatment ever-more expensive and sophisticated. Britain spends 6
percent of gross national product on health, compared with an
average of 9 percent in other industrialized countries.
   The service is funded out of general taxes and a compulsory 10
percent deduction for health and state pension contributions from
each employee's salary, which employers have to match.

   A lone bagpiper played a Scottish
lament and relatives hugged and wept Tuesday at a symbolic burial
service for 17 people whose bodies were never found following the
crash of Pan Am Flight 103.
   A single black casket containing the ashes of unidentified
remains was lowered into a grave at Dryfesdale Cemetery outside
Lockerbie to the strains of ``Flowers of the Forest.''
   The 30-minute prayer service was attended by about 500 mourners,
including 34 relatives of six missing Americans.
   The ashes represented the Americans, one Canadian, three
Hungarians and seven Lockerbie residents whose bodies were either
not found or identified. Police called off the search last week.
   A bomb exploded aboard the New York-bound Flight 103 on Dec. 21,
killing 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground.
   The coffin was lowered into the grave by representatives of the
airline, the police, the armed forces and other rescue services.
   Among the missing were Tom and Rosalind Flannigan, whose
10-year-old daughter, Joanne, is buried nearby. Their house was
destroyed in the crash.
   Some relatives threw soil into the grave or left personal
mementos at the graveside. These included a photograph of Nicole
Boulanger, 21, of Shrewsbury, Mass., and a newspaper clipping
telling of one of her successful performances as a drama student.
   A local clergyman, the Rev. Alan Neal, said those who died ``were
part of us and will forever be part of our lives. May this last
farewell express the depth of our love for them. May it ease our
sense of loss and strengthen our hope.''
   U.S. Consul General Douglas James, and representatives of the
airline and the British and Hungarian governments presented wreaths.
   The grave was marked by a simple granite stone presented by Pan
Am and inscribed, ``In memory of all victims of the Lockerbie air
disaster who died on Dec. 21, 1988.''
   In London, the Transport Department said Tuesday that more than
100 measures to tighten security at British airports have been
implemented since the bombing.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon said in a statement to
Parliament that the measures include tougher conditions for issuing
passes to the vicinity of aircraft, more searching of staff and
articles they carry when entering controlled areas, and searching
all vehicles approaching aircraft.
   It also includes increased patrols, a reduction in the number of
control posts to release staff for improving security elsewhere, and
escorting delivery goods to minimize the risk of prohibited articles
reaching aircraft.

   A lawyer for convicted child killer Joel
Steinberg said Tuesday he will appeal his client's first-degree
manslaughter conviction on the ground the judge allowed evidence
that inflamed and prejudiced the jury.
   Attorney Ira London said state Supreme Court Justice Harold
Rothwax prejudiced the case by letting the jury see a videotape of a
seriously beaten Hedda Nussbaum, the defendant's former live-in
companion, and by his instructions to the jury on intent.
   The lawyer objected to Rothwax's statement at a pretrial bail
application that second-degree murder defendant Steinberg was
``probably guilty, probably would be found guilty and probably would
be sentenced to life in prison.''
   ``I think that statement the judge made is something he may
regret in view of the appellate issues we are going to raise in the
case and we will include that,'' London said.
   Steinberg, 47, was convicted of first-degree manslaughter Monday
in the death of Lisa, the 6 year old he obtained at birth and raised
but never legally adopted.
   The jury found Steinberg guilty after eight days of deliberations
following a 12-week trial. Steinberg faces up to 25 years in prison.
   ``There is no question in my mind from the length of the
deliberations and from talking to the jurors ... there is no
question that Joel got a fair shake from the jurors,'' London said.
But ``it is a serious issue whether Joel got a fair trial because of
the judge's rulings.''
   London said the judge hurt Steinberg unfairly when he refused to
answer ``no'' to the jurors' question about whether they should
infer intent on the basis of the victim's injuries even though they
had been unable to find intent.
   ``We felt a simple one-word answer would have answered the
question,'' the lawyer said. He noted that the jury came in a short
time later.
   ``He chose not to say `no,' and he chose to go into some long
explanation which later, according to what the jury has told us, led
to the conviction on manslaughter in the first degree,'' London said.
   And allowing the jury to see the tape of Ms. Nussbaum's injuries
inflicted by Steinberg ``was a prejudice that I don't know any
criminal defendant could recover from.''

<BYLINE>Yusupov And Spraggett Draw; Move To Sudden-Death Finish ^By DAVID
GOODMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Artur Yusupov of the Soviet Union and Kevin
Spraggett of Canada drew the seventh game in the World Chess
Championship Candidates quarterfinal on Tuesday, leaving the match
to be decided in a sudden-death finish.
   The 27-move draw left the match score tied 3.5 points apiece. The
victor of the eighth game, scheduled for Thursday, will win the
contest and advance to the semifinal stage.
   In the event of a draw, a series of sudden-death tiebreakers at
increasingly high speeds on Saturday will decide the contest.
   Canadian observers are hoping Spraggett, a 34-year-old from
Montreal who will play with the advantage of white on Thursday, will
defeat the pre-match favorite and become the first North American
since Bobby Fischer to reach the semifinals.
   The winner of the Candidates, a series of knockout matches, will
challenge world champion Garri Kasparov for his title.
   In the seventh game, Yusupov, playing white, gained a clear edge
from the opening and began to build a dangerous initiative, experts
said.
   But Yusupov, a 28-year old Muscovite, chose a safe but passive
continuation on his 21st move that enabled Spraggett to neutralize
white's advantage.
   Both players used up most of their allotted time in their early
stages and left themselves only half an hour to ponder 20 moves.
Each player has two hours in which to mkae their first 40 moves.
   Canadian observers said Yusupov appeared nervous in the latter
stages of the game.
   ``Spraggett is in good physical shape and his nerves will be good
if it comes down to a blitz finish,'' said Canadian International
Master Jean Hebert. British Grandmaster Jonathan Speelman is already
through to the semifinal stage of the Candidates.
   Former world champion Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet Union leads
Iceland's Johann Hjartarson by 1.5-0.5 in the third quarterfinal in
Seattle, Wash.
   The first game of the remaining match, between Dutch Grandmaster
Jan Timman and Lajos Portisch of Hungary in Antwerp, Belgium, was
adjourned Tuesday after 61 moves.

   An explosion triggered by a mattress fire ripped
through a fourth-floor apartment Tuesday, propelling three
firefighters out windows and injuring eight, officials said.
   ``It's called a flash-back,'' said Fire Department spokesman
Frank Szwedo explained. ``It has the same properties as an
explosion.''
   The firefighters were extinguishing what had started as a
mattress fire when oxygen reached the smoldering material, causing a
blast with such force that it apparently sent the firefighters out
the windows, Szwedo said.
   The most severe injury was sustained by Joseph Gaska, 39, a
firefighter who fell four stories, officials said. Gaska underwent
surgery for abdominal injuries and was in serious condition with
second-degree burns, said Michael Reese Hospital nursing superviser
Joyce Gaines.
   No residents of the South Side apartment building were reported
injured, Szwedo said.
   Five firefighters suffered burns to the head or neck areas,
another had multiple fractures and another had a broken ankle and
possible back injuries, Szwedo said.

   The last of the military
victims of a Pan Am jetliner crash over Scotland was returned
Tuesday to the United States to a brief planeside ceremony at Dover
Air Force Base.
   The remains of Army 2nd Lt. Jewel C. Mitchell, 32, were welcomed
by an 18-member U.S. Air Force honor guard.
   After the flag-draped coffin was removed from the plane, and a
base chaplain said a prayer, the remains were taken to the base
mortuary to be prepared for burial.
   Mitchell was among 15 active duty military personnel killed when
a bomb exploded on Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21.
Killed were 259 passengers and crew, and 11 people on the ground.
   Among the dead were 10 dependent military family members.
   Mitchell, of New York, was assigned to the 40th Transportation
Co., 21st Theater Army Area Command at Manheim, West Germany.

<HEAD>Business, Opposition Leaders Unhappy With Government's Economic Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: SUBS lead to CORRECT to 1989; ADDS 4 grafs too UPDATE with La
Prensa comment and Ortega reported seeking Venezuelan aid.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders and businessmen said
Tuesday they were puzzled and dissatisfied with the leftist
Sandinista government's austerity plan for 1989 and will not support
it.
   President Daniel Ortega's speech outlining the inflation-fighting
plan ``is rather nebulous,'' said Ramiro Gurdian, president of the
Union of Nicaraguan Agricultural Producers and vice president of the
Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, an opposition coalition.
   ``He (Ortega) did not mention he had the backing of the producers
because he simply doesn't have it,'' Gurdian said in an interview.
   Ortega, in a speech before the National Assembly on Monday,
outlined a 1989 economic plan that includes budget cuts of more than
40 percent, a decrease in capital investments and restricted credit.
   The budgetary cuts will mean laying off about 35,000 government
workers, Ortega was quoted as saying in an interview published
Monday in the Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional.
   The plan's aim is to curb rampant inflation, which reached 20,000
percent last year and is projected to run at 300 percent a month
through May.
   It also seeks to increase productivity in this Central American
country, Ortega said exports plummeted from $450 million in 1980 _ a
year after the Sandinistas took power _ to $267 million in 1988.
   The Sandinistas have been meeting with labor groups and
businessmen to seek their support for the plan, which Ortega said
would cause an economic downturn initially.
   ``The measures have an element of a recessive character,'' Ortega
said in his speech. ``This is inevitable, although temporary.''
   The president said idle workers could be absorbed into
agriculture, including 10,000 needed in coffee harvesting.
   Gurdian said the coffee harvest was about to end and doubted an
office worker could be very effective as a field hand.
   ``Maybe they can be employed for a month, but when it's over,
then what? What are you going to do with those people?'' Gurdian
said.
   Ortega said his government is ``trying to apply a capitalist
policy different from the other countries which have been held up to
us as models.'' But he added that ``we as Sandinistas, Marxists,
Marxist-Leninists'' are trying to develop socialism within
Nicaragua's reality as a Central American country.
   ``I've been trying to find messages of political economy, and I
must confess that I'm lost,'' said Enrique Bolanos, a cotton grower
and former president of the Superior Council of Private Enterprise.
   ``He's cutting investments nearly to zero, and if there's no
investment, there's no growth; if there's no growth, there are no
new jobs,'' Bolanos said. Ortega also said production costs will be
strictly controlled because they ``cannot be higher than in the
Central American markets.''
   Gurdian and Bolanos blamed high production costs on the state,
which sets the price of raw materials and buys products from growers
at a set price.
   ``They (government) tell you, `Here's the raw materials, here's
your tractor and these are going to be your profits,''' Gurdian said
angrily. ``I am not going to work so the state can tell me how much
I'm going to earn. I work to earn money.''
   The Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate includes four political
parties, three labor unions and the Superior Council of Private
Enterprise.
   The opposition newspaper La Prensa said Ortega's speech left
Nicaraguans disillusioned, and it called for reforms that would let
them elect a new government ``that is more efficient and
advantageous for the people.''
   Meanwhile, Venevision, a private television station in Caracas,
Venezuela, said Ortega has asked Venezuela for economic aid.
   Ortega met with Venezuelan President-elect Carlos Andres Perez
after his arrival in Caracas for Perez' inauguration, scheduled for
Thursday.
   Venezuela and Mexico provide cheap oil to some Caribbean and
Central American nations under the San Jose Accord, begun in 1975 by
Perez during his first presidency. But since 1982, Venezuela stopped
providing oil to Nicaragua because Managua did not pay its bills.

   Unionized attendants at a state-run
hospital temporarily halted their sickout Tuesday after they were
threatened with dismissal and National Guard troops were called in
to feed, wash, and dress patients.
   Eighty of the 91 workers scheduled to work the 3 p.m. shift
showed up, and the Guard was sent home, said hospital administrator
James Benedict.
   The union and the state will negotiate their disputes over
staffing, scheduling and overtime during a two-week cooling-off
period, said Robert K. Vincent, a governor's aide who met with union
officials for 1{ hours.
   ``If they can't agree, they'll shake hands and agree to disagree,
but they'll address that disagreement through the normal procedure''
of grievances and arbitration, Vincent said.
   Union officials were not at the union hall and did not return
telephone calls seeking comment.
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete called out the Guard to fill in for absent
workers after talks collapsed Monday between Local 1350 of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and
Thomas D. Romeo, director of the state Department of Mental Health,
Retardation and Hospitals.
   Vincent said DiPrete had warned the workers that any who did not
show up for Tuesday's third shift, beginning at 11 p.m., and could
not prove they were ill would risk being fired.
   ``We're kind of out of our element, but we seem to be doing OK,''
said Sgt. Dean Mansfield, one of about 60 Guardsmen who rolled up
the sleeves of their fatigues and went to work Tuesday morning.
   The state-run hospital provides long-term care to 425 patients,
about 75 percent of whom are elderly.
   Romeo, under heavy pressure from DiPrete to cut overtime costs,
ordered changes in the hospital work-schedules that angered the
union.
   The changes will remain in place during the cooling-off period,
Vincent said. He said the hospital's overtime budget has been
$55,000 for each two-week pay period, but actual spending has been
closer to $95,000. The changes are aimed at bringing that figure
down to $85,000 per two weeks, Vincent said.
   Eighty-five of the 106 workers scheduled for Tuesday's first
shift reported for work, said Joan M. Wilkicki, the hospital's
administrative coordinator.
   The absentee rate has varied greatly from shift to shift. On
Monday, most of the first shift reported for work but well over half
of the second-shift workers called in sick.
   The Guard pitched in to perform ``non-skilled'' care, such as
feeding, washing and dressing patients and changing their linens,
under the direction of medical staff, said Capt. John Loughlin II,
the Guard's public information officer.

<TEXT>
   The navy on Tuesday reversed its
position and said the tourist boat that sank on New Year's Eve,
killing 55 people, was overcrowded and not fit to venture into sea
waters.
   A two-week examination of the boat, which was hauled from the sea
floor in mid-January, showed the Bateau Mouche should have carried
not more than 62 when it capsized and sank with at least 150
revelers aboard, a navy report said.
   The report said the popular sightseeing craft was badly
maintained, had a waterline above the basement portholes, had a
second-floor addition that affected the boat's stability and was
full of loose, heavy tables and chairs.
   The boat sank while on a midnight excursion to watch fireworks
off Copacabana beach.
   Days later, the Navy Ministry released a report that declared the
boat was fit for 153 people and seaworthy, according to port
authority guards.
   But the navy and police investigating criminal responsibility in
the sinking have been under constant pressure from civic groups
comprised mostly of friends and relatives of victims.
   The navy said Tuesday it would open an investigation to determine
why naval engineers approved the boat for large tourist excursions.
   The navy said it also would investigate why port authority guards
allowed the midnight sail despite obvious overcrowding and severe
rocking of the boat in high waves.
   The owners of the boat and the tourist agency that organized the
excursion were imprisoned briefly last week and released on bail.
Police have not yet determined criminal responsibility.

<HEAD>U.N. Expects Foreign Ministers of Iran and Iraq In New York Next
Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq are
expected to visit New York next week when the Security Council
debates the peacekeeping force separating their armies, a U.N.
spokesman said Tuesday.
   The presence of both foreign ministers would give
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar a chance to discuss ways
of breaking the stalemated Iran-Iraq peace talks.
   Negotiations on ending the eight-year war deadlocked immediately
after they began Aug. 25.
   U.N. officials hope Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and his
Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, will be present when the
Security Council considers extending for six months the mandate of
the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group on Feb. 8, said U.N.
spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   A diplomatic source close to the talks said the foreign ministers
were informally invited to New York.
   The foreign ministers have not announced whether they will attend
next week's council session.
   Perez de Cuellar received a briefing Tuesday from his special
representative to the peace talks, Swedish U.N. Ambassador Jan K.
Eliasson, who returned from visiting Baghdad and Tehran during the
last week.
   Eliasson's talks with senior Iranian and Iraqi officials produced
no sign of progress on the major stumbling blocks in the peace talks
_ freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf or the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway; the exchange of 100,000 prisoners of war; or withdrawal of
military forces to the border.

<TEXT>
   At least 13 more people were killed in
pre-election violence, officials said Tuesday. The government
assigned armed bodyguards to candidates but took steps to control
their movements.
   The government also invited foreign groups to monitor the Feb. 15
parliamentary election.
   Eleven of the latest slayings were blamed on Sinhalese radicals
of the People's Liberation Front and occurred in southern and
central Sri Lanka late Monday and Tuesday, a police officer said on
condition of anonymity.
   Indian troops stationed in Sri Lanka to enforce an
Indian-brokered Tamil peace accord on Tuesday shot and killed two
people believed to be members of the most powerful of the Tamil
separatist group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in northern
Sri Lanka, police said.
   A senior police officer, also speaking privately, said the
government has assigned 8,376 bodyguards _ six to a candidate.
   ``In addition to the politicians being issued two pistols, one
for himself and the other for his most trusted bodyguard, police
have issued four repeater shotguns'' for each candidate, the officer
said.
   Political violence before the election prompted the government to
order candidates to keep their gun-toting bodyguards off the streets
after sundown, a senior police officer said Tuesday.
   Ten candidates have been slain in the past 3{ weeks.
   The governing United National Party, headed by President
Ranasinghe Premadasa, blames the Sinhalese front and opposition
parties for most of the political killings.
   The biggest opposition group, former Prime Minister Sirimavo
Bandaranaike's Sri Lanka Freedom Party, and other opposition groups
say the political assassinations were carried out by bodyguards and
other gunmen working for members of the United National Party.
   Police statistics say 600 people were killed in political
violence in January, but a Western diplomat said he thought the
figure was too high. The diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, declined to say what he thought the actual toll might be.
   The government on Tuesday said it was inviting international
groups to monitor the election in which nine political parties and
10 independent groups are fielding 1,396 candidates for the
225-member Parliament.
   The government said the People's Liberation Front killed 800
people prior to January. Most of the victims were government
officials, policemen or supporters of the United National Party.
   The front vowed to kill anyone who supported the government's
attempts to end an insurrection by members of the Tamil ethnic
minority. The front said a July 1987 peace accord offered too many
concessions to the Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people.
   Tamil guerrillas have been waging a guerrilla war and terrorist
campaign since 1983 in their quest for a separate homeland, which
they say is needed to combat what they call discrimination by the
Sinahlese majority.
   More than 8,500 people, including at least 600 Indian
peacekeeping soldiers, have died in the Tamil revolt. Most of the
victims were Sinhalese civilians massacred in their villages or
ambushed on buses and trains.
   The Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population, dominate
the government and the military.

<TEXT>
   The feuding family of brain-damaged
singer-composer Barry Sadler has agreed to allow a judge to name an
independent guardian to handle his affairs, another judge said
Tuesday evening.
   Cuyahoga County Probate Judge John J. Donnelly said Sadler's
family ``has gotten together'' and agreed to let Probate Court Judge
James Everett, in Nashville, Tenn., name an independent guardian.
   Under the agreement, the guardian must consult with family
members before making major decisions for Sadler, said Donnelly, who
said relatives indicated a preference for naming as guardian a
Vietnam veteran like Sadler.
   Sadler's mother, Bebe, and son, Thor, 24, had made competing
appeals to be named guardian for Sadler, who was interviewed Monday
night by Donnelly at Southwest General Hospital in suburban
Middleburg Heights.
   ``The responses were confusing,'' said Donnelly. Sadler
repeatedly referred to this year as 1980 even after being told the
correct date, the judge said.
   Sadler, 48, could name only two of his three children, Donnelly
said.
   Sadler is best known for his ``Ballad of the Green Berets,''
which was a hit in 1965. He reportedly lost 30 percent of his brain
when he was wounded by gunfire last fall in Guatamala City, where he
had lived for five years.
   The nature of the attack has never been disclosed.
   A psychiatrist and psychologist, both of whom interviewed Sadler
at the hospital, testified Tuesday at the guardianship hearing and
were split on whether he was mentally competent.
   Gintautas Z. Sabataitis, a psychologist from Parma Heights, said
Sadler was competent but ``severely limited'' in his abilities and
needed a guardian to look after his affairs.
   Joel S. Steinberg, a Lyndhurst psychiatrist, said he had not
determined whether Sadler was competent.
   ``I didn't reach a conclusion about that,'' he said. ``I had to
leave it in the air.''
   Steinberg said Sadler had suffered ``profound neurological loss''
but said he was surprised by Sadler's capacities.
   Sadler's mother, who moved to Cleveland from Denver to be close
to her son, filed for guardianship after Thor Sadler was appointed
guardian for his father by a judge in Nashville.
   Sadler was treated there for two months before coming to the
Cleveland Veterans Administration hospital Nov. 8.

   The Directors Guild of America on Monday
announced its nominations for the prestigious DGA achievement award,
marking the five directors as favorites for Academy Awards in March.
   Alan Parker, who brought the controversial civil rights film
``Mississippi Burning'' to the screen, was one of the five nominated
for outstanding directorial achievement in 1988.
   Also named were Charles Crichton, director of the crime-caper
comedy ``A Fish Called Wanda''; Barry Levinson, who guided the
autism film ``Rain Man''; Robert Zemeckis, the creative force behind
the animated, live action hit ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit''; and Mike
Nichols, director of the corporate comedy ``Working Girl.''
   Only three times in motion picture history has the DGA award
winner failed to go on to win the Academy Award for best director.
   In 1985, Steven Spielberg won the DGA honor for ``The Color
Purple'' but Sydney Pollack took the Academy Award for ``Out of
Africa.'' The two other non-repeaters were Francis Ford Coppola in
1972 when his ``Godfather'' lost to ``Cabaret'' and Anthony Harvey
in 1968 when ``The Lion in Winter'' lost to ``Oliver.''
   Clint Eastwood, who won a Golden Globe for best director
Saturday, wasn't among the nominees, who are chosen by a vote of
their peers. But ``Working Girl,'' which won four Golden Globes, and
``Rain Man,'' winner of two, both are in the running.
   ``I was hoping Clint Eastwood would be nominated this year, but
(his film ``Bird'') wasn't,'' said Spielberg, who announced the
nominations at a news conference at the DGA headquarters. ``I
thought `Bird' was an outstanding directorial accomplishment,'' he
said.
   The DGA winner will be announced March 11 at the 41st annual DGA
awards dinner-dance, to be held concurrently in Los Angeles and New
York.
   All 9,000 members of the DGA were eligible to vote on the
nominations, and all are eligible now to vote for the winner. The
guild includes film and television directors and their assistants.

   President Bush intends to nominate Michael H.
Armacost, currently Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs,
as the new U.S. ambassador to Japan, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
   Armacost is the highest-ranking career foregin service officer at
the State Department. He succeeds former Sen. Mike Mansfield, who
has retired.
   Armacost's pending nomination was confirmed by U.S. sources who
declined to named.
   He is a former U.S. ambassador to the Philippines and is also the
ranking Asian specialist on the National Security Council staff.
   Bush is due to visit Japan for the Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor
Hirohito. U.S. relations with Tokyo are at a crucial stage, with
pressure building in Congress to have the Japanese increase their
contribution to the country's defense.
   Another problem in the relationship is the U.S. trade deficit of
$57 billion caused by an influx of Japanese products.
   But Mansfield, announcing his retirement late last year, said he
was leaving with ``our heads high'' because the deficit had been
narrowed as a result of hard bargaining to open Japanese markets and
efforts to get Japan to boost its domestic consumption as well as
imports.
   Japan is also beset with domestic problems, including allegations
that top politicians or their aides profited from shares in a real
estate development firm by buying them before the firm was publicly
traded.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita will hold talks Thursday and
Friday with Bush, Secretary of States James A. Baker III and
Congressional leaders.
   Under former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Armacost played
a key role in dealing with Soviet authorities on regional disputes
in Afghanistan, southwest Africa, Cambodia and Central America.
   An imposing 6-footer, Armacost has a quiet demeanor and low-key
style.
   Twenty years ago, he served in Tokyo as a visiting professor of
international relations at the International Christian University in
Tokyo.
   Armacost, 51, is a graduate of Carleton College and Columbia
University. He is married and has three children.
   He is expected to be succeeded in the job of under secretary of
state by Robert Kimmet, a Washington lawyer. Bush is breaking
precedent by not naming a career diplomat to the post, but Lawrence
Eagleburger, another former foreign service officer, is to be
nominated Deputy Secretary of State.
   In another move, Bush is expected to name Richard T. McCormack,
former ambassador to the Organization of American States, to the
post of Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.
   Late Tuesday, congressional sources said Bush is expected to pick
Bernard Aronson, a Democrat, as assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs.
   A Democratic Senate source, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, said the choice had been made because Aronson was a
moderate who could appeal to both Democrats and Republicans on
divisive Central American policies, and Nicaragua in particular.
   Aronson would succeed Elliott Abrams in the post. Abrams became
the lightning rod for the Reagan admistration's Nicaragua policy,
which was the longest-running dispute with Congress of his tenure.
   Meanwhile, a White House source said President Bush is expected
to name John Negroponte, deputy national security adviser, as
ambassador to Mexico. Negroponte, a former ambassador to Honduras,
also has served in a variety of foreign postings, including in Hong
Kong, Vietnam and Ecuador.

   Abba Eban, Israel's former foreign
minister, on Tuesday rebutted accusations by a senior PLO official
that the Jewish state is using Nazi methods to suppress the uprising
in its occupied territories.
   The Monday statements by Bassam Abu Sharif, a senior aide to
Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat, were
``intellectually ridiculous and morally outrageous,'' Eban told
reporters.
   Abu Sharif and Eban spoke outside a privately sponsored
conference on ``The Israeli-Palestinian Problem in European
Perspective,'' which involves prominent figures from both Israel and
the PLO.
   But both men's public addresses to the three-day gathering, which
opened Tuesday, reflected a far more conciliatory mood and called
for direct Israeli-PLO talks to end the Mideast conflict.
   Abu Sharif told a Monday news briefing that ``even the Nazis did
not dare to implement several of the measures'' being used by
Israeli troops to stop the 14-month uprising in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   So far, the uprising has cost the lives of at least 370
Palestinians _ including 47 killed by supposedly non-lethal Israeli
plastic bullets _ and of 15 Israelis.
   ``Our people and our organization are suffering under organized
state terrorism,'' Abu Sharif said. He charged that Israel had set
up ``concentration camps'' for Palestinians that he compared to Nazi
Germany's Auschwitz death camp of World War II.
   Eban told reporters on Tuesday, ``That sort of rhetoric is going
to be an obstacle to peace. ... It is a stupid thing to say.''
   But he also noted that ``I notice that neither he (Abu Sharif)
nor his colleagues used such language in our presence here today.''
   Instead, the PLO official said in his conference address, ``We
hope the future developments (in the Mideast) will help to convince
(Israeli premier Yitzhak) Shamir there is no other way to peace but
to sit down and talk.''
   Palestinians realize ``realize they cannot build their future on
the ruins of another people,'' Abu Sharif said.
   In his address, Eban told the conference that he believed the
PLO's recent renunciation of terrorism and its acceptance of
Israel's right to exist behind secure borders.
   ``If it is real, it would be reckless not to probe it and if it
were a fraud, it would be important to expose'' the PLO claims, Eban
said. ``We must surely have reached the negotiating hour.''

   Real events are so outrageous these days that it
sometimes seem satire and parody aren't possible. Then along comes
``The Kathy &amp; Mo Show: Parallel Lives,'' at the off-Broadway
Westside Arts Theater, proving that oblique looks at life can be
surprising and hilarious.
   Kathy Najimy and Mo Gaffney write and perform an evening of duet
vignettes, much in the way that Lily Tomlin has done a series of
solo character portraits.
   The show, which opened Tuesday night, is subtly feminist. It
begins with the two women as angels deciding at the Creation how to
organize the human race. They pick skin colors and worry that white
people may feel inferior. They give men egos so they won't feel
deprived while women bear the children.
   We check back with the angels at the start of Act 2. About the
white people, Kathy says, ``Don't ask.'' She reports that ``the male
ego thing certainly took off.''
   The two women are expert at every character they present, young
and old, women and men.
   Sometimes their sketches are deeply felt and poignant. One
concerns the daily meeting in a Texas bar of a married drunk who
keeps proposing and a gallant, lonely woman who fears she'll never
get what she needs to make her feel complete because she doesn't
know what it is.
   Kathy does one tender solo turn, as a woman whose favorite nephew
admits he's homosexual. She gives up her wish for him to have a wife
and children, and decides to remain his doting aunt.
   Some sketches are holdovers from ``The Further Adventures of
Kathy and Mo,'' presented at the off-Broadway Second Stage in 1986.
One new one, in which Kathy dreams of being the perfect wife Kenny
Rogers sings about, with cuts to Mo, a prostitute talking to
herself, doesn't quite work. And the coda, in which many of the
sketches' characters return for an instant, is more confusing than
fun.
   But we laughed through almost all the evening, especially as the
elderly Madeleine and Sylvia shift gears adjusting to a meatless,
fishless health-food restaurant, even donating to its cause _ ``Save
the fish.''

   The record cold air that stunned Alaska swept into the lower 48
states Tuesday, dropping temperatures in Montana by more than 70
degrees in less than a day, and the weather system keeping Alaska
cold intensified to a North American record.
   Blowing snow driven by winds gusting to over 100 mph in some
areas dropped visibility to zero, closing schools in Montana and
North Dakota and briefly shutting down a Minnesota highway.
   Balmy weather that set records for warmth in many cities ended
abruptly in Montana, where Great Falls dropped to 10 degrees below
zero Tuesday morning, after Monday's record high of 62, the National
Weather Service said.
   Helena, Mont., plummeted from 44 degrees at 6 a.m. Tuesday to 6
below zero at 8 a.m. Wind chill factors plunged to near 80 degrees
below zero in parts of the state and East Glacier had 6 inches of
snow by mid-morning, the weather service said. By afternoon much of
the state was below zero.
   The agency issued a blizzard warning for the eastern slopes of
the Rockies in Montana and warned: ``This is a very dangerous storm
and anyone caught outdoors will be in grave danger in the warning
areas.''
   In the town of Cut Bank, about 100 miles north of Helena, the
temperature plunged 23 degrees in one minute, and 103 mph winds
dropped the wind chill to 75 below zero. By 7 p.m., it was 22
degrees below zero.
   ``It was a drastic drop, really fast,'' said Glacier County
undersheriff Bill Barron.
   But ahead of the cold air, high temperature records were broken
or tied Tuesday in 64 cities from Colorado to Ohio and from northern
Texas into southern Minnesota. Dodge City, Kan., soared to 80
degrees, surpassing the record of 76 set in 1911; Chicago climbed to
65, breaking its 1877 record of 56; Louisville, Ky., hit 67, also
breaking a 112-year-old record; Detroit climbed to 60, breaking the
mark of 54 degrees set in 1890; Grand Island, Neb., reached 72; and
Fort Smith, Ark., hit 77.
   Cold air from Siberia was trapped over Alaska by a dome of
extremely high atmospheric pressure. The barometer at Northway,
Alaska, rose to a record high of 31.74 inches of mercury, the
weather service reported Tuesday.
   The previous North American record was Monday, at 31.54 inches at
Big Delta, Alaska, which toppled the old record of 31.53 measured in
Canada's Yukon Territory in January 1974. By contrast, hurricane
Gilbert had the lowest recorded pressure in the Western Hemisphere
at 26.22 inches on Sept. 13.
   ``This is the highest, coldest record-breaking system in the past
100 years,'' said meteorologist Wally Younker in Anchorage.
   Alaska's overnight low was 62 below zero at Eagle and Northway
near the Canadian border, and the wind chill in the Bethel area fell
to 80 below early Tuesday.
   Temperatures of minus 40 kept schools closed for a second day in
Fairbanks and Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper ordered all non-essential
state workers in the city to stay home until the cold spell snaps.
   Schools also were closed a second day in the Matanuska-Susitna
Valley north of Anchorage because of wind chills to 50 below. Snow
drifts up to 4 feet were reported at the intersection of the Parks
and Glenn highways. Heavy ice in Cook Inlet hampered barge traffic
between Nikiski refineries and coastal villages that need fuel.
   Juneau chilled only to 11 below zero early Tuesday, but Alaska
Electric Light and Power Co. asked people to conserve electricity to
avoid rotating blackouts. An avalanche last week downed the power
line to the city's hydroelectric dam, and one of the city's two
auxiliary diesel-fired generators failed.
   The Montana Highway Department advised emergency travel only
Tuesday on most highways from Helena north to the Canadian border.
North Dakota authorities advised no travel in the northeastern part
of the state, including Interstate 29, because of blowing and
drifting snow. Twenty-six miles of U.S. 2 in northwestern Minnesota
were closed by blinding, blowing snow.
   Wind gusting to 86 mph pushed ahead of the cold air crossing
Wyoming on Tuesday, ripping porches from houses and destroying an
empty mobile home, said Dan Dennis, chief of the Lander Rural Fire
Department.
   In Washington state, crews were in the process of restoring power
to more than 100,000 customers in Island, Snohomish and Skagit
counties where high winds felled utility lines.
   Forecasters in North Dakota said the Siberian blast could last
until mid-February and predicted overnight lows this weekend of 20
to 40 below zero.
   High wind knocked down utility poles, cutting off power in
scattered areas in northwestern Montana and along the eastern slopes
of the Rocky Mountains, and utilities said their repair crews were
struggling in the cold.
   ``They can't hardly stand to work in it,'' said Cal Hatch, line
superintendent with Sun River Electric Co-op Inc. near Great Falls.
   Some Montana schools stayed open Tuesday because they feared
sending children back home in the bitter cold. School District 1 in
Helena said children who couldn't be taken directly home by bus or
would be home alone would be taken back to school to await their
parents.
   Some orchardists in Washington state fired up smudge pots to save
the nation's largest cherry crop and the second-largest apricot
crop, both of which were just beginning to bud. The state's fruit
industry is worth $540 million.
   ``All that weather you have been reading about in Alaska and
Canada's Yukon will plunge southward,'' warned weather service
meteorologist John Jannuzzi in Seattle.
   No deaths or injuries directly attributable to the cold had been
reported in Alaska. There has been speculation, by the governor and
others, that icy fog may have contributed to Sunday's crash of a
Canadian military plane that killed eight men.

<HEAD>Party Leader Hints Major Leadership Changes Possible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chief said in an
interview published Tuesday that a split in the party leadership is
slowing reform and indicated high-level personnel changes are
possible.
   Karoly Grosz, reviewing the first 10 months of his tenure as
party leader, said the leadership is ``waging a battle within
ourselves'' which has slowed its ability to implement reform.
   Differing views are leading to a ``deterioration'' of the party's
ability to implement reform, which could be grounds for personnel
changes in the party elite, he told journalists from the government
daily Magyar Hirlap and the Communist newspaper Nepszabadsag.
   If the party's policy-making Central Committee ``reaches the
conclusion that the political committee (Politburo), or the general
secretary ... cannot fulfill their tasks in this situation, it
should draw the appropriate conclusions,'' Grosz was quoted as
saying.
   ``A leadership and a leader has to reckon with all this,'' he
said in excerpts of the interview, carried by the state news agency
MTI.
   In the same interview, Grosz appeared to criticize Imre Pozsgay,
a member of the party's 11-member ruling Politburo.
   Pozsgay, one of the country's leading reformers, said in a
weekend radio interview that the 1956 anti-communist revolt was not
a counterrevolution, as officially termed for the past 30 years, but
a popular uprising.
   Grosz said Pozsgay's statement, based on work by a party
committee he heads that is reviewing the country's past 40 year
history, was premature.
   But in a television interview broadcast Monday evening, Grosz
said the Central Committee could reach the same conclusion as
Pozsgay ``if the facts justify it.''
   Many of the demands voiced in the short-lived revolution, such as
increased democracy, a multiparty system and opposition to a
Stalinist-style leadership are reflected in Hungary's reform process
now.

<HEAD>Licensing Board Clears Obstacle To Low-Power Tests at Seabrook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of two obstacles to low-power testing of
the Seabrook nuclear power plant was cleared Tuesday when a federal
board decided not to hold hearings on workers' performance during an
emergency exercise.
   Seabrook's owners now can get their long-awaited low-power
license if they prove that they can come up with $72.1 million to
decontaminate and dismantle the reactor if it conducts the atomic
tests but never operates commercially.
   The $5.8 billion Seabrook reactor was completed in July 1986
after years of delays and cost overruns. It remains idle because of
evacuation-planning and financial obstacles.
   In a Dec. 21 ruling, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission set two
conditions for low-power testing: establishment of the
decommissioning fund, and a decision by one of its licensing boards
on whether to open hearings on plant workers' performance during the
two-day exercise in June.
   Seabrook spokesman Sean O'Neill said Tuesday plant owners expect
to submit a decommissioning-fund plan ``within the next couple of
weeks.'' John Eichorn, chairman of the Seabrook owners' executive
committee, said recently the owners are trying to buy a surety bond
to meet the $72.1 million commitment.
   On procedural grounds, the licensing board Tuesday dismissed
Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon's request for the
hearings, NRC spokesman Frank Ingram said. The plant is near the
Massachusetts border, and six Massachusetts communities lie within
the plant's 10-mile evacuation plan.
   Shannon's request was based on an NRC staff inspection report
dated July 15 but the request was not filed until Sept. 16.
   The licensing board said Shannon waited too long to file the
request.
   A spokeswoman for Shannon, Mary Breslauer, promised an appeal.
   ``Obviously we believe we were well within the legal time frame''
for filing the contention, she said. ``What we got (from NRC
inspectors in July) was an initial report, very undetailed ... We
did not get detailed backup reports until mid-August. Clearly until
then we couldn't file.''
   The initial NRC inspection report said Seabrook control-room
support staff displayed ``questionable engineering judgment'' and
other shortcomings during a hypothetical accident under the exercise
scenario.
   The NRC concluded, however, that plant workers passed the test,
which was part of a federal exercise of Seabrook's evacuation plans.
   O'Neill, the Seabrook spokesman, said plant officials also had
not yet seen the licensing board ruling, but ``it sounds like good
news.''
   Licensing delays last year forced the key Seabrook owner, Public
Service Company of New Hampshire, to seek bankruptcy protection, and
other owners' finances also have become strained.

   A military refueling jet bound for Hawaii
crashed in a ball of flames on takeoff Tuesday at Dyess Air Force
Base, killing all 19 people aboard, the Air Force said.
   Officials at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base near Marquette, Michigan,
where the flight originated, said the plane's passengers included
spouses of military members or retired military members.
   The plane's crew ``never got it off the ground,'' said witness
Vernon Wright, 19. ``The first thing I saw was just the mushroom of
the smoke.''
   ``I heard the plane as it was coming down,'' said Skeet Jackson
of Abilene. ``Engines were backfiring and missing. It curved off to
the left and crashed. And then I saw the ball of smoke and fire go
up.''
   Initial reports fowarded to Air Force commanders at the Pentagon
suggested the pilot of the plane experienced some kind of problem
during his take-off roll, according to officials who spoke on
condition they not be identified.
   ``It was toward the end of the roll and he apparently had no
choice but to press on,'' said one source.
   ``But he didn't have the power to get up for some reason,'' added
another.
   The wreckage burned for more than an hour after the crash. The
plane came to rest tilted at about a 45 degree angle, a charred wing
tipped toward the sky.
   Military search and rescue teams set up floodlights and searched
into the night before the last two bodies were found, a base
spokesman said.
   The flight manifest showed that 17 of those on board were from
Sawyer Air Force Base and the other two boarded at Dyess, Master
Sgt. Al Dostal at Dyess said.
   The plane was en route from Dyess to Hickam Air Force Base in
Hawaii on a training mission, said Dyess Airman 1st Class Beverly
Foster.
   The sources in Washington said the plane was carrying close to a
full load of fuel totaling 155,000 pounds, including its own fuel
and fuel to transfer during the flight to Hawaii to some F-16
fighters flying across the Pacific.
   The Air Force said the KC-135A tanker crashed at 12:10 p.m. near
the south end of the Dyess runway, near U.S. Highway 277 about six
miles southwest of Abilene.
   The maintenance record for the plane, powered by four Pratt &amp;
Whitney jet engines, was not yet available, said Lt. Col. George
Peck, a spokesman at Strategic Air Command Headquarters at Omaha,
Neb.
   There is no ejection system on the plane, built in 1963, said
Peck.
   It was the second crash at Dyess in less than three months. A
B-1B bomber crashed there Nov. 8. The four-man crew safely bailed
out.
   The KC-135, dubbed the Stratotanker, is the backbone of the Air
Force's refueling fleet.
   The aircraft, a military spin-off of the Boeing 707, normally
takes a crew of four or five. It can carry a sizeable load of
passengers even when carrying fuel.
   The military began using the first KC-135As in 1956. The tankers
have a range of 1,150 miles while carrying 120,000 pounds of
transfer fuel. They cost $20.1 million.
   A KC-135 crashed Oct. 11, 1988, at Wurtsmith Air Base near
Oscoda, Mich. That plane, also based at Sawyer, crashed and burst
into flames on landing, killing six and injuring 10. An
investigation into that crash has been completed, but SAC has not
made it public.

   Employers and all but the poorest Americans
would be taxed to finance a national health care system extending
medical insurance to the estimated 37 million who lack coverage,
under a plan proposed by a commission including three former
presidents.
   The proposal encourages continued reliance on private health
insurance provided through the workplace, but calls for a new
program to provide universal access to basic medical services. Costs
would be spread among employers and all Americans above 150 percent
of poverty level.
   The plan offered Monday is designed to extend medical coverage to
all Americans, stem the growth of medical expenses which now stand
at $550 billion annually, and improve the quality of medical care
nationwide, said the National Leadership Commission on Health Care,
which worked 2{ years preparing its proposal.
   ``If we continue the present trend, the $550 billion will double
in six years and triple in 12 years,'' said Paul G. Rogers, a former
Democratic congressman from Florida who co-chaired the commission
with former Iowa Gov. Robert D. Ray, a Republican.

   Joel Steinberg was convicted of manslaughter but
not murder in his adoptive daughter's death after jurors rejected
testimony by his battered live-in companion that he beat the girl
and left her comatose on the bathroom floor.
   Eight days of heated deliberations ended Monday when the jury
reached the compromise verdict in the case that refocused national
attention on domestic violence.
   By acquitting Steinberg of second-degree murder, the jurors
decided that the disbarred lawyer had not shown ``depraved
indifference to human life'' when he struck his illegally adopted
6-year-old daughter, Lisa, in a rage in November 1987.

   In an attempt to end Nicaragua's
economic crisis, President Daniel Ortega has announced plans to cut
the budget by nearly half, lay off 35,000 troops and public
employees and end subsidies for basic goods.
   He said in announcing the austerity plan on Monday that city
dwellers would be hardest hit and suggested many move back to the
farm.
   Speaking to the National Assembly, Ortega called for the
cooperation of private business and told landholders the leftist
Sandinista government would no longer confiscate private property.
   In ending the two-hour, 40-minute address, he told his fellow 3.5
million Nicaraguans that sacrifice is needed to bring the economy
out of crisis and curb inflation, which reached 20,000 percent last
year.

   The judge who sentenced former Olympic diver
Bruce Kimball to 17 years in prison for the drunken driving deaths
of two teen-agers says he hopes the case ``screams out to young
people.''
   Kimball, 25, pleaded guilty during the first hour of his trial
Jan. 11 to spare the victims' families the pain of hearing testimony
and viewing photographs of the Aug. 1 accident, his attorney and
family have said.
   On Monday, he again changed his plea, this time from guilty to no
contest as a technical move aimed at making it easier for victims
and their families to gain insurance benefits.
   Prosecutors said Kimball was drunk and driving about 75 mph when
his sports car slammed into a crowd of 30 teens gathered on a dark
dead-end street in suburban Brandon, killing two and injuring four.

   Pakistani officials are willing for the first
time to agree to verification that they are not building nuclear
weapons if they are permitted to buy U.S.-made reactors for power
production, says a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who brought the proposal back from a
recent trip to Pakistan, said Monday it deserves serious
consideration and he will hold hearings on the idea in his Asia
subcommittee.
   Solarz said ``key'' Pakistani officials had endorsed the
reactors-for-safeguards swap but declined to say which ones. During
his stay in Islamabad he met with new Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and army Chief of Staff Gen. Aslam Beg,
among others.
   Under the proposal, Pakistan would agree to some form of
negotiated verification process to ensure that its nuclear program
is put only to peaceful uses, and is not devoted to weapons
development.

<HEAD>Epic McMurtry Western Turned into Four-Day Event for CBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Durn. Just when you write off the whole danged
network season, CBS comes along with a big ol' event, a four-night
masterpiece of a Western, ``Lonesome Dove.''
   The eight-hour miniseries begins Sunday and runs through
Wednesday.
   Readers who loved Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel
can be assured that Austin screenwriter Bill Witliff has transformed
it into a film that enlightens rather than obscures the heart of it.
   For viewers who haven't read the novel, the movie stands on its
own. It's proof that the miniseries is still a worthwhile genre for
epics like ``Lonesome Dove'' that can't be contained in a two-hour
film.
   The cast is virtually unprecedented for a network movie _
Oscar-winners Robert Duvall (``Tender Mercies'') and Anjelica Huston
(``Prizzi's Honor''), plus Tommy Lee Jones, Diane Lane, D.B.
Sweeney, Frederic Forrest, Robert Urich, Ricky Schroder, Chris
Cooper, Glenne Headly and William Sanderson.
   Witliff wrote ``Raggedy Man'' and ``Country'' and co-wrote ``The
Black Stallion.'' Director Simon Wincer's credits include ``Phar
Lap'' and the network miniseries ``Bluegrass.''
   But the miniseries belongs to Duvall. Well, the book did belong
to Gus McCrae. Duvall, an actor who becomes his role, has found in
coot-philosopher Gus a character who becomes the actor just as much.
   Jones (with his hair dyed white) holds his own with Duvall, no
mean feat. He has perhaps a more difficult role, as the simmering,
taciturn Call.
   Gus and Call are legendary ex-Texas Rangers reduced to running a
down-at-the-heels cattle outfit along the Rio Grande, just outside a
wide spot in the road called Lonesome Dove.
   When old companero Jake Spoon (Urich) shows up after 10 years,
running from a fatal misunderstanding in Arkansas, he's full of
tales of a cattleman's paradise in a wilderness called Montana.
   Call, without Indians and outlaws to keep his mind off the ghosts
of his past, figures an adventure is just what he needs, and he's
soon rounded up 2,600 head of Mexican cattle and an inexperienced
bunch of hands and headed off on a 3,000-mile trail drive.
   Gus is usually satisfied to sit on the porch avoiding work,
swigging whiskey and expounding loudly on any subject that happens
to come up. But he goes along hoping to see his true love, Clara
(Huston), who is married to a horsetrader in Nebraska. Jake trails
along with Lorie (Lane), a young prostitute who believes his promise
to take her to San Francisco.
   Meanwhile, Arkansas sheriff July Johnson (Cooper) embarks
reluctantly on a mission to bring Jake to justice. He is soon
distracted, though, by the news that his wife (Headly) has run off.
She, too, is bound for Nebraska, and an outlaw she still loves.
   Along the way, the cowboys tangle with sandstorms, stampedes,
horse thieves and Indians. Lorie is stolen by Blue Duck (Forrest), a
vicious renegade who duels with Gus and meets an unusual demise.
   Witliff did an exceptional job of turning McMurtry's vivid but
often introspective 840-page book into a film, preserving the
dialogue and improving the ending by a simple rearrangement of minor
events.
   Much of the violence and raunchiness of the book remains, though
toned down for network TV. When Gus is under attack by Indians on
the open plains, he stabs his horse to death to use him for cover.
   Wincer occasionally lapses into unnecessary slo-mo melodrama. But
only occasionally. The action sequences are mostly superb.
   Set designer Cary White has turned the ``Lonesome Dove'' of
imagination into a reality. And Douglas Milsome's cinematography is
evocative without being too darned purty.
   Witliff telescopes many events, so the miniseries gets going much
more quickly than the book. By the end of the first night, the trail
drive is under way and the first fatality has occurred at the Nueces
River. By then, any viewer with a pulse should be hooked.
   In exchange for the quicker pace, the miniseries shucks some of
the character development of the book. There's no way around that
unless the network stretched the miniseries into a week. After four
nights, viewers might wish that they had.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gunfire comes from a passing car,
exploding just after the shouted gang slogans _ battle cries on the
urban killing fields where the medics move in to pick up the pieces.
   In the darkness, sometimes with the gunmen still looking on from
the sanctuary of a gathering crowd, the paramedics move in.
   They ignore red and blue gang colors and tattoos, tending wounds
sometimes reminiscent of war, radioing ahead to an emergency room
already overcrowded with the city's poor. There, an ER doctor will
treat yet another victim of the violence that claimed 351 lives in
Los Angeles County last year.
   Suburban counties are beginning to mount their own tolls.
   For Los Angeles County fire paramedics like Mike Siefert and Joe
Kinney the victims and shootings blur together. Only the most brutal
stand out.
   For Siefert, that was a bloody morning at Gage and Rugby avenues
in Huntington Park, a primarily Hispanic suburb where downtown
highrises loom in the distance like mirages of prosperity. The
attack was retaliatory. The victim was the mother of a gang member,
shot in the stomach with a shotgun.
   ``They assassinate one another,'' Siefert said.
   Sometimes the killers don't flee, forcing paramedics to work
under the eye of gang toughs who Kinney said often ``walk right back
up and watch; see if they killed them or not.'' Sometimes paramedics
must watch victims bleed, waiting until police secure the area.
   The Los Angeles City Fire Department will not even allow its
paramedics to be interviewed for fear that the attention will put
them at risk.
   In the heart of the violence is Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew
Medical Center, near Watts amid neighborhoods claimed by the Bloods
and Crips black street gangs.
   The most common operation at the hospital is an exploratory
laparotomy, to repair damage from a gunshot wound. In 1986, there
were 754 such operations _ nearly four times the number of
appendectomies, said Dr. Arthur Fleming, chairman of surgery.
   ``You give it your 102 percent and you patch them up and you send
them out to start the vicious cycle all over again,'' said Brenda
Allmond, the hospital's trauma nurse coordinator.
   Police Chief Daryl Gates has likened street warfare to conflicts
in Lebanon, Northern Ireland and South Africa. With attackers here
favoring Uzi submachineguns and AK-47 assault rifles, those on the
front line know the references to war are not so far-fetched.
   ``The trauma is exactly the same,'' said Kinney.
   Doctors say they see more shotgun and small-caliber handgun
wounds than those from Uzis. But they don't diminish the violence.
   ``They'll say to you if their loved one dies, `You're going to
get more business tonight' ... and the retaliation sets in,'' Ms.
Allmond said.
   Gang members 10 at a time have stormed emergency room doors at
King to get to the wounded. ``There were times the gang members
walked in ER and our doctors were shaking in their boots,'' said
Fleming.
   The violence did not always rate front-page headlines and
top-of-the-hour newscasts. But on Jan. 30, 1988 Karen Toshima _ a
27-year-old Long Beach woman who could have been anyone from the
comfortable suburbs _ was slain by gang crossfire while strolling
through Westwood, the upscale district of shops, restaurants and
theaters near the University of California, Los Angeles.
   With that began Los Angeles' 1,000-officer task force nicknamed
``The Hammer,'' which rounded up hundreds of reputed gang toughs;
the so-called gang summits with local ministers that brought a call
for jobs but no end to the shootings; and the ``city under seige''
news stories.
   Fleming, a former military man, says the solution is a job corps,
combining work and discipline for gang members. But he believes
police sweeps have had some success quelling violence.
   The day after a weekend sweep that netted 870 arrests, ``we had
one death in one 17-year-old and other than that it was relatively
quiet.'' The teen who died bore the MSC tattoo, initials of the Main
Street Crips. He was slain by a bullet that clipped the main vessel
leading into the bottom of the heart.
   Hundreds survive the violence. Some come to Rancho Los Amigos
Medical Center in suburban Downey for rehabilitation.
   In the hallway, Dr. Lance Stone, director of the adult brain
injury unit, passes a zombie-like young man, who shuffles slowly,
eyes focusing loosely when Stone says hello. The man was a bystander
to a gang fight. Bullet fragments hit him in the arm and head,
leaving him with nerve injury and extreme pain. He had been
attending college; now he can write, but no longer knows how to read.
   Stone estimated 10 percent to 15 percent of his patients bear
gang-related injuries. Dr. Douglas Garland, director of the spinal
cord injury unit, where the primary cause of injury is gunshot
wounds, puts the number near 35 percent.
   These men have seen patients unable to move because of
gang-related injuries, patients who will need wheelchairs the rest
of their lives, but still retain gang affiliations.
   ``We've had patients who have refused a red or a blue
wheelchair,'' said county social worker Wendy Ross.
   Ms. Ross' one ``success story'' is an 18-year-old who was shot
during his gang initiation about two years ago. The gang provided
the target, and Ms. Ross believes it was a setup. The target was an
undercover policeman, who drew his weapon and shot the boy, leaving
him without the use of his legs. The teen-ager has earned his high
school diploma, moved into his own place and is starting community
college. He wrote to thank Ms. Ross for her friendship and help in
beginning a life without his legs. Then added, ``But if that is what
it cost for me to change my ways and find good friend it worth it.''
   For others, there are few bright spots.
   Dr. Joe Morales, director of emergency admitting at Los Angeles
County-USC Medical Center, sees more than a dozen gang victims, most
under the age of 25, come through hospital doors each week.
   ``If they're 7 or 8, we assume they're innocent,'' Morales said.
``Otherwise we lose all hope.''

<HEAD>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Program Targets Military Veterans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The setting is peaceful, on a lake
surrounded by Douglas firs. But peace is far from the minds of the
war veterans who meet here to unload decades of violent and fearful
thoughts and feelings.
   For many, it's the first time since the war that they've felt
free to cry.
   ``Some of these people haven't felt in years,'' said Anne
Gregory, manager of nurses for the post-traumatic stress disorder
program at the Veterans' Hospital at American Lake, herself a
Vietnam veteran.
   ``The fact that some of these people are still sane is
remarkable. PTSD is treatable, but it takes time,'' Gregory said.
   An estimated 470,000 of the 3.14 million vets who served in
Vietnam suffer from PTSD and 80 percent of those never have sought
mental help, said American Lake director Ray Scurfield. His is one
of 14 relatively new programs in this country trying to help PTSD
victims. Three percent of its participants served in Korea and World
War II, the rest in Vietnam.
   In the company of other vets and a professional staff of 23 that
includes 13 veterans, men who never quite left the war behind tell
of sleepless nights, flashbacks, guilt over having killed, guilt
over having survived, uncontrolled anxiety and rage and the
isolation they feel.
   Holding hands, they ride in Huey helicopters in maneuvers similar
to those commonly used in the war. The sound of the rotors and rush
of wind was enough for one to tearfully recall his last flight in a
Huey, a trip that ended in an ambush and the deaths of 18 of the 35
men in his squad.
   Some go on an Outward Bound trip and push their limits in rapids
in search of new perspectives on their abilities and their lives.
   Many vets are hearing for the first time that it's human to feel
what they feel, and that anyone who has experienced severe trauma _
the Holocaust, for example, or even major earthquakes _ can feel the
same way.
   And it's the first time many have let go _ the birth of a long
period of healing, forgiveness, learning to live with memories,
trusting themselves and others, and hoping for the future.
   ``They're digging things out of me here that I didn't even know
were issues,'' said Dan Collins, 42, of Tacoma. ``You look at
somebody and see them blown to hell, and they're not there.
   ``It's a convenient way not to make friends, because I'm afraid
of them dying ... I avoid people ... for that and other reasons.
   ``That's the nice thing about this place. They confront you on it
and you have to face what's going on inside of you.''
   Scurfield said any victim of severe trauma can develop chronic
symptoms that can include intrusive imagery, numbing, helplessness,
fear that leads to rage, fear that leads to grief, anger against
authority and ``the system,'' inability to control emotions and
actions, broken relationships and work histories, depression,
anxiety, hypervigilance and sleeping disorders.
   They sometimes express those symptoms and other times avoid
expression altogether, as they probably did at the time the trauma
took place. This leads to physical and emotional isolation and
confusion over personal responsibility, self-worth, relationships,
work _ even play.
   The 11-week program at American Lake, begun in 1985, has served
350 so far, and has an eight-month waiting list. Applicants must
have served in a war zone, have received some counseling already,
and be drug- and alcohol-free. It costs the Veterans Administration
$107 per day per patient.
   Participants learn about controlling anger, anxiety and stress
and about substance abuse and PTSD. They also examine pre-war
experiences that may have contributed to their war reaction;
war-zone trauma; and their post-war years.
   They even look at the benefits of trauma: intense comradeship,
emotional and spiritual insights, and heightened sensitization to
life's horrors and to political behavior, Scurfield said.
   ``By going back to the wound, you finally realize that you have
to feel the pain, the grief, the loss, before the wound is actually
healed,'' said Leonard Horst, 42, of Sequim. ``You'll always have
the scar, but at least you have acceptance and forgiveness.''
   All are encouraged to attend outpatient counseling for six months
to three years to consolidate gains made while in the program,
Scurfield says. Failure to do that can easily mean backsliding and
renewed isolation.
   Vets listen carefully when Scurfield explains how their anger
probably stems from fear. How they had to go to Vietnam at a time
when they would have been undergoing a lot of change anyway and so
were especially vulnerable. How they're the only ones who can change
the crazy life patterns.
   ``The rage is justified, but you still need to let go of it,''
Scurfield said. ``If how you're going to feel or what you're going
to do is determined by someone else, you're not in control... I'm
not saying don't fight, you must ... not let the symptoms control
you. Open a valve and release some of it without hurting yourself.''
   The understanding and definition of the disorder continues to
evolve. How successful American Lake and PTSD treatment are is
anybody's guess without a better follow-up system and more
coordination among the 14 programs, said Scurfield, a doctor of
social work who did psychiatric work in Vietnam.
   A lot more money and programs are needed, especially in the West,
Scurfield testified before Congress last summer. Special emphasis
should be placed on professional support for veteran self-help
groups in geographically isolated areas, where many choose to live
because of low, fixed incomes.
   Scurfield lays the delayed response in identifying and treating
PTSD _ a disorder professionals now believe has always existed among
trauma victims _ to naive psychology trends, right-wing beliefs that
common knowledge of PTSD would undermine the country's ability to
defend itself, and concerns over the immense potential financial
strain of treatment.
   In a recent survey sent to 180 American Lake graduates and
answered by 85, a majority had been helped in self-esteem,
relationships, and understanding they have the responsibility and
ability to change. But a significant minority reported no real
change in depression and anxiety, relationships and intrusive
symptoms.
   ``I definitely needed another tuneup and more time,'' said
Richard Fairfield, 39, of rural northeast Utah. ``It took me 20
years to get as screwed up as I was... If they had helped me 20
years ago, I wouldn't be here. The program should be longer.''
   Ten percent of participants have returned once, Scurfield said.
   Despite its admitted weaknesses, Steve Petty, a VA social worker
in Loma Linda, Calif., and a member of a congressionally mandated
PTSD committee, says American Lake is considered on the cutting edge
of treatment.
   ``These people know what's going on,'' said Fairfield. ``When I
wake up at 3 a.m. drenched in sweat and have to talk, they're
there.''
   It's the only program with a special support group for children
of Vietnam vets, and it's the only one that incorporates the
helicopter rides.
   ``I was trying to make sense out of nonsense,'' said Jeff
Russell, 36, of Olympia. ``I felt I was the only person who felt
that way.
   ``This program ... gave me a chance to work on issues and stop
from hitting bottom... I have to pick myself up, and live.''

   If Orson Welles were alive today, he would likely
be fuming about ``goats and monkeys.''
   That's how the celebrated filmmaker of ``Citizen Kane'' often
referred to Hollywood studio executives who tampered with his
movies. It was a line from Shakespeare's ``Othello,'' and Welles was
indeed a classicist and a genius.
   But despite his artistry and the acclaim he received after his
brilliant work on 1941's ``Citizen Kane'' _ considered by many to be
the greatest movie ever made _ he was never able to direct another
Hollywood film without major interference from the front office.
Welles, who died in 1985, often boasted that it was the only film
that was never taken away from him.
   But even ``Citizen Kane'' is no longer immune to tampering.
Turner Entertainment Co., which infuriated filmmakers and movie
buffs by colorizing ``Casablanca'' and ``It's a Wonderful Life''
among others, has announced plans to give Welles' classic the same
treatment. Television entrepreneur Ted Turner acquired the rights to
the movie in 1985 when he bought MGM-UA Entertainment Corp. with its
massive film library for $1.5 billion.
   Directors, including Woody Allen, the late John Huston and Billy
Wilder, and such actors as Jimmy Stewart, took their fight against
colorization to Congress, pushing for legislation to create a
national film commission with powers over the color-enhancement
computerized process. They have long argued that the process often
destroys the original work of art, changing mood and intent.
   Turner has long argued that he's merely protecting his investment
by tapping into a new audience for old movies of the 1930s and '40s
_ young people who grew up on color TV.
   ``I like things in color. We see in color,'' Turner said. ``I'm
colorizing `Casablanca' just for controversy's sake. Once people
start watching the colored version, they won't bother with the
original.''
   However, while Turner presents his color versions on his two
cable-TV networks, other commercial networks continue to show the
black-and-white originals and attract large audiences.
   And colorized films have had only moderate success in video
sales, according to Van Stevenson of Erol's Inc., the nation's
largest independent video chain.
   Sales figures for 1988 show that the colorized version of ``It's
a Wonderful Life,'' by far the biggest seller, sold 2,000 units at
the retail price of $8.95. For the black-and-white version, 10,705
sales, retailing at $4.95, were reported. Few colorized films are
available for rentals.
   ``There's a market for both,'' Stevenson acknowledged. ``I think
you have to keep in mind what's out there. Most of the young people
grew up in a colored world while film buffs and afficionados want
the originals.''
   While two companies are coloring test scenes of ``Citizen Kane''
to see if the process is even feasible on the movie, critics
continue to fume.
   ``It's nothing short of criminal. They're tampering with a
masterpiece,'' said director Robert Wise, who helped edit ``Citizen
Kane.''
   ``If he (Welles) were alive today, he would be at somebody's
throat. He would be bombasting all over the place.''
   While ``Citizen Kane'' made headlines at first when a brash,
young Welles parodied the life of newspaper magnate William Randolph
Hearst, it is an unchallenged, magnificent work of art and
technology because of its innovative use of lighting, camera and
sound.
   While many movies had been made in color by 1941, notably ``Gone
With the Wind,'' ``The Wizard of Oz'' and ``A Star Is Born,'' Welles
considered black-and-white essential to setting the proper mood for
his film.
   ``Orson always said a black-and-white film abstracts reality,''
recalled Barbara Leaming, who collaborated with Welles on his
autobiography. ``The words he always used for Kane were
`hallucinatory' and `dreamlike.' He said it created a mood several
steps removed from the real world.
   ``For Orson, black-and-white was one the things that gave
`Citizen Kane' the possibility of being an art film. He said all of
the elements were conceived in the same way. If you change one
element, all of the other elements are going to look wrong.''
   Although Welles had never made a feature film before signing a
contract with RKO in 1939, he was already famous. In 1938, his
notorious ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast convinced thousands
of people that Martians had landed in New Jersey. His innovative
stage productions with the Mercury Theatre and his work with
Harlem's Negro Theatre, including an all-black presentation of
``Macbeth,'' made him the talk of Broadway.
   He considered several sources for his first film. He had
originally attempted an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's short novel,
``The Heart of Darkness'' (later a source for Frances Coppola's
``Apocalypse Now''), but the start of World War II in 1939
endangered the film's success in Europe, a market considered vital
by RKO.
   He also looked into making a comedy starring Carole Lombard or
Lucille Ball and a Mexican melodrama based on a novel by Arthur
Calder-Marshall but then came up with on another idea based on
conversations with his friend, Ashton Stevens, a drama critic for
the Hearst-owned Chicago American.
   Stevens had intrigued Welles with his depictions of Hearst, whose
parties at his San Simeon castle and extra-marital affair with the
actress Marion Davies were the talk of Hollywood.
   Welles and Herman Mankiewicz put together a script that
chronicled the life of a newspaper tycoon and would-be politician,
Charles Foster Kane, who dies a lonely man after his attempts to
make an opera singer out of his wife, Susan Alexander, destroy his
personal and professional life. (They won the Academy Award for best
screenplay.)
   The film's plot centered on a reporter's efforts to determine the
meaning of the dying Kane's final word, ``Rosebud.'' For those who
never saw the movie, Rosebud was the name of his sled.
   Hearst was the main source for ``Citizen Kane'' but Welles also
drew upon the lives of obert McCormick, a wealthy Chicago
businessman who had himself tried to promote an untalented opera
singer, and Samuel Infull, who had built an opera house in Chicago.
   Instead of a straightforward narrative, ``Citizen Kane'' jumps
back and forth in time as the reporter interviews people who knew
Kane and newsreels depict the highlights of his public life. It is
similar in structure to ``Marching Song,'' a play Welles wrote when
he was 17, based on a reporter's search for the abolitionist John
Brown.
   ``Orson was fascinated by a story within a story,'' said Leaming,
a professor of theater and film at Hunter College. ```Citizen Kane'
was a logical development.''

   Welles cast himself as Kane and also used several of the old
Mercury players, including Joseph Cotten, Everett Sloane and Agnes
Moorehead. To compose the soundtrack, he hired Bernard Herrmann, who
would later work with Alfred Hitchcock on ``Vertigo,'' ``North by
Northwest'' and several other films.
   But the most important member of the ``Citizen Kane'' crew was
cinematographer Gregg Toland, whose credits included ``Wuthering
Heights'' and ``How Green Is My Valley.'' Toland, anxious for the
chance to try out new techniques, had requested to work for Welles.
   ``Toland was the single greatest cinematographer of all time,''
Wise said. ``He was a master in every way.''
   Toland and Welles made extensive use of deep-focus photography,
which by putting the entire frame of a picture into focus, allowed
several points of view to be shown simultaneously. Deep-focus had
been used by silent film director D.W. Griffith but was largely
discontinued in 1925 when a new type of film stock made the effect
technically unfeasible.
   By the late '30s, however, the quality of film had improved
enough to allow again for deep-focus, and Welles and Toland used it
to stunning effect.
   In one scene, Kane's parents sign an agreement to place young
Charles under the guardianship of Walter Thatcher, a cold-hearted
New York banker. Kane's father is seen at the left side of the frame
and his mother is in closeup at the right with Thatcher leaning over
her shoulder. In the background, Charles is seen playing outside in
the snow. Because everyone in the frame is shot in focus, the viewer
can appreciate how many people are affected by what has taken place.
   In another scene, Susan is taking a singing lesson from Matisti,
a prominent teacher. The lesson is obviously going badly and Matisti
is clearly frustrated by Susan's hopelessly off-key singing.
   An increasingly impatient Matisti is seen in the left side of the
frame, a clearly uncomfortable Susan sings on the right side, and in
the far background, Kane, in sharp focus, enters the room and
angrily advances to the piano. Again, several points of view are
expressed in one frame.
   Welles often shot Kane from floor level to make him appear larger
and demonstrate his dominance over other people. In one of the
film's final scenes, when Kane's marraige is rapidly falling apart,
Welles uses camera angles to underline the relationship of the
couple. Kane is shot from below as he listens to Susan scream, and
is viewed from above when he responds, making him tower over her.
The shadow he casts obscures her.
   Ceilings had rarely been seen in a Hollywood film until Welles
put them on camera in ``Citizen Kane'' by using extreme up-angle
shots.
   ``I suppose that closing the top of a set was the real revolution
we caused,'' Welles once said. ``It's disastrous to let a camera
light a set without a ceiling _ it's artificial.''
   Before ``Citizen Kane,'' filmgoers' main exposure to newsreels
had been Hearst's ``March of Time'' clips, which offered hyped-up
versions of current events. Because of an intricate technical
process, the newsreels in ``Citizen Kane'' had the same ``grainy''
look as the Hearst films.
   ``What I had to do was take all the film Orson shot and degrain
it,'' Wise said. Frank Miller, manager of public relations for
SuperStation TBS, said a company to do the coloring has not yet been
hired and could not determine what would be done with the newsreel
footage.
   Shooting for ``Citizen Kane'' began in June of 1940 and was
completed in late October. The film premiered in May 1941 at the
Palace Theatre in New York and received rave reviews except from
papers controlled by the outraged Hearst.
   ``On seeing it for the first time, one got a conviction that if
the cinema could do that, it could do anything,'' said film critic
Penelope Houston.
   Welles' next film, ``The Magnificent Ambersons,'' was reduced by
RKO from 131 minutes to 88 minutes after a disastrous screening. By
1948, Welles was working for Republic Pictures Corp., which
specialized in film vehicles for such cowboy stars as Gene Autry and
Roy Rogers. He would have only sporadic success the rest of his life.
   ``I began at the top and have been making my way down ever
since,'' Welles said.
   In the mid-1970s, Ralph Weinger, an electronic equipment designer
from Philadelphia, began experimenting with the process of
converting black-and-white film to color.
   ``The black-and-white film is transferred to one-inch
videotape,'' Weinger said. ``A computer operator picks out key
frames from each individual scene and by using an electronic light
pencil assigns color values to the actors and objects. Then the
computer takes over and colors all the other frames in the scene.
   
   ``A minute of the scene can be colored in one hour. A 100-minute
movie can be completed in a day and a half.''
   The average cost for colorizing a movie is $183,000.
   The first job for Weinger's process was the 1978 TV docu-drama,
``King.'' Filmways could find no color footage of the 1963 March on
Washington to interweave with the dramatized Martin Luther King,
Jr., story. Weinger provided four minutes of the March in color.
   NBC heard about the process and hired Weinger to color a
half-hour of World War II newsreels for ``Ike,'' the biography of
Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   Turner Entertainment issued its first colorized version of a
Hollywood classic in 1986 with ``Yankee Doodle Dandy.''
   ``They go back to the original black-and-white negative and make
it sure it's in the best possible condition. It's then transfrerred
to video tape. We never touch the negative,'' said Turner
Entertainment's Miller.
   ``The corporation has a team of researchers who study everything
available about the film. They talk to people around at the time.
They also study the styles of Technicolor of the period. Their
research is pretty exhaustive.''
   The colorization of films has also meant that high-quality prints
for the black-and-white versions are now available. In February, New
York's Biograph Theatre, a leading revival house, will be starting a
``Tribute to Turner Entertainment,'' showing brand new prints of
``Citizen Kane'' and ``Casablanca'' among others.
   ``The Turner people are very good, first class,'' said Frank
Rowley, program director of the Biograph. ``I play the pictures as
they're meant to be played.''
   For Welles, who was working on an adaptation of ``King Lear'' at
the time of his death, films were meant to played in
black-and-white. Leaming recalled that even in the '80s, he had an
aversion to filming in color.
   ``He knew that the pressure of the market became too strong, that
people wanted color films,'' Leaming said. ``He would say, `I'll put
a color prolog on `King Lear' and fool them. They'll give me the
money and then I'll shoot it in black-and-white the way it should
be.'''

   Americans' after-tax incomes shot up 3.8
percent last year, with some of the extra money going to raise the
nation's personal savings rate from the 40-year low it had hit just
a year before.
   The Commerce Department said Monday the gain in income, adjusted
for inflation, was the best since a 3.9 percent gain in 1986 and
more than double 1987's 1.7 percent.
   In December, personal income totaled $4.2 trillion, with much of
the $37.1 billion jump from November resulting from farm subsidy
payments. Without those outlays, the government said, December's
total income would have been up 0.8 percent.

   Americans' after-tax incomes shot up 3.8 percent last year, but
the cost of employer-sponsored health care jumped 18.6 percent,
according to new reports.
   The Commerce Department said Monday the gain in income, adjusted
for inflation, was the best since a 3.9 percent gain in 1986 and
more than double 1987's 1.7 percent. Some of the extra money went to
raise the nation's personal savings rate from the 40-year low of a

   Analysts said the report stirred some inflationary concern in the
bond market but was largely shrugged off by Wall Street, where the
Dow Jones industrial average edged up 1.25 points to 2,324.11, its
highest close since the market crash in October 1987.
   The health-care survey by A. Foster Higgins &amp; Co. in New York
found that costs rose 18.6 percent per worker last year after
increases of 7.7 percent in 1986 and 7.9 percent in 1987.
   The average cost per employee of health care plans was $2,354 in
1988, up from $1,985 in 1987, according to the survey of more than
1,600 employers, whose plans cover 10 million workers and dependents.
   In December, personal income totaled $4.2 trillion, with much of
the $37.1 billion jump from November resulting from farm subsidy
payments. Without those outlays, the government said, December's
total income would have been up 0.8 percent.
   Last year's income gains spurred both spending and savings.
   Consumer spending rose 2.8 percent after adjusting for inflation,
following increases of 2.7 percent in 1987 and 4.3 percent in 1986.
   In December alone, spending rose 0.9 percent, with the biggest
increase, 4.1 percent, posted for durable goods _ ``big ticket''
items expected to last three or more years.
   Meanwhile, the average personal savings rate rose a full
percentage point, from 3.2 percent to 4.2 percent, the highest since
the 4.4 percent set in 1985.
   The 1987 rate was the smallest since a 3.1 percent rate in 1947.
   Economists said the figures were a good sign for continued
economic strength in the coming year.
   ``There's a balanced picture for consumers, with a strong
increase in income, a solid increase in spending and some increase
in savings,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co.
``All three of those ... are quite desirable if the expansion is
going to keep on rolling along.''

   Face to face at last with the big savings and
loan issue, America's private and public leaders will writhe in pain
as they seek a way out of the mess, hoping to disguise the pain or
dissipate it most broadly.
   The fact is, however, that no such effort can help society avoid
paying the cost of bailing out insolvent thrifts, estimates of which
seem to be at a rock- bottom low of $20 billion and an uncapped high
of more than $100 billion.
   It matters not what you call the vehicle for raising the money _
a tax, a fee or an increase in insurance premiums _ it is inevitable
that a large number of ordinary Americans are going to pay for it.
There is no other way.
   It matters not, for example, who the culprits are or what they
did or the injustice of it all. You can jail the culprits, but you
cannot transform mismanagers into financial geniuses who can earn
back and pay what they lost.
   The pain may be hidden in business assessments, but business
sooner or later passes on its costs to customers. There's no way
Uncle Sam can pay, since he has hardly a dime in his pockets that
you, taxpayers, didn't give him.
   So testy is this matter, that it threatens to end President
George Bush's honeymoon abruptly. Bush's proposal calls for a
25-cent a year fee for every $100 on deposits at banks, credit
unions and, of course, savings and loans.
   Clearly, it has flaws. It might, for instance, unfairly penalize
smaller institutions and their depositors while allowing operators
of large money market funds to escape. Conceivably, money could flow
from one to the other.
   But any proposal that is offered is likely to be flawed and
subject to criticism as unfair.
   Recognizing this, William C. Dunkelberg, professor of economics,
authority on savings and loans, and dean of Temple University's
School of Business and Management, offers this defense of Bush's
proposal:
   ``Our problem is simply this: We failed to accurately forecast or
anticipate the insurance liability for the S&amp;L systems. So, we
charged too low a premium to cover the insurance claims.
   ``Now, we need a surcharge that amounts to 25 cents per $100 of
deposits. It means that if you have $100 in your local bank paying 5
percent interest you will get $4.75 rather than $5 for every $100 of
savings.''
   Dunkelberg cites state automobile insurance charges as roughly
comparable.
   ``During the 18 months I have lived in New Jersey, this has
happened a number of times to my automobile insurance. Liabilities
for uninsured and high- risk state insurance program were
dramatically underestimated.
   ``As a result, we were `taxed,' if you wish to use that word, to
make up the shortfall in the past premiums that had been charged.
   ``I may be unhappy with the insurance premium boost, incensed
over rumors of mismanagement, poor planning, fraud and other factors
that produced the huge insurance deficit, but I cannot solve any of
those problems by refusing to pay the `one-time' additional charge
on my premium to remove the deficit _ claims now owed by the
insurance system to thousands of innocent motorists.''
   The S&amp;L situation, he maintains, ``is no different.''
   Many people affected to one degree or another will challenge that
assertion, and the entire proposal might be abandoned for another
that, in turn, is likely to be severely criticized.
   The issue is basic and painful, one that touches on the phrase
``we the people,'' so often cited to express pride in participatory
government.
   Most often the reference is in regard to inherent rights. The
rest of the definition defines obligations.

   The lid on the cost of health-care plans popped
off in 1988 as the expense per worker of employer-sponsored programs
shot up 18.6 percent, a new survey says.
   The jump came after two years of moderate increases _ 7.7 percent
in 1986 and 7.9 percent in 1987 _ and ``there doesn't appear to be
much relief in sight,'' according to a report released Monday by A.
Foster Higgins &amp; Co., a New York-based benefits consulting firm.
   Health insurers swallowed some of the unexpected cost increases
last year and will pass them along this year, ensuring another stiff
rise, said John Erb, the managing consultant who conducted the
survey.
   The average cost per employee of health care plans was $2,354 in
1988, up from $1,985 in 1987, according to the survey of more than
1,600 employers, whose plans cover a total of 10 million workers and
dependents.
   The figures include the cost of plans to both employers and
employees.
   The medical-care component of the Labor Department's Consumer
Price Index rose 6.9 percent last year, making it the
fastest-growing part of the inflation measure. But the cost of
services is only part of the problem for employers and employees,
Erb said.
   According to Erb, these were some of the factors in last year's
big jump:
   _Expensive medical services such as heart and liver transplants
are becoming more widely available, so more people are using them.
   _The federal and state governments, strapped for money, are
holding down how much they pay health-care providers for Medicare
and Medicaid patients. That forces the providers to raise their
prices to other customers.
   _Doctors are raising fees for outpatient services because
patients tend to be more highly reimbursed for them and are less
likely to complain. The higher reimbursement was intended to
encourage use of outpatient services, which are generally cheaper
than hospital care.
   _Doctors are requiring more follow-up visits, some of which may
not be medically necessary.
   ``The providers of care have gotten wise to some of the tricks
and are compensating for it,'' Erb said in an interview.
   John J. Ring, chairman of the American Medical Association, said
in response he did not see any evidence that doctors were reaping
big fee increases from the shift to outpatient care.
   Ring, a family physician in Mundelein, Ill., also said he would
like to see statistics backing up Erb's claim that doctors were
requiring medically unnecessary follow-up visits. Erb said he did
not have such statistics.
   The 1988 increase was smallest, 15.6 percent, for companies with
under 1,000 employees, which usually pay for their plans through
insurers. Insurers did not anticipate the big increase in expenses
last year and are likely to put through big increases this year to
compensate, Foster Higgins said.
   To illustrate the increased availability of high-tech medical
care, Erb said there are about 120 U.S. medical centers that can do
heart transplants, up from 30 just two years ago. Also, he said, it
has become common for hospitals to give heart-attack patients a dose
or even two of TPA, a clot-dissolving drug that costs $2,000 a dose.
   ```Miraculous cures' are becoming more common,'' he said in a
written statement. ``But miracles cost money.''
   The cost of providing benefits for mental health and substance
abuse shot up 27 percent in 1988 to an average of $207 per employee
and now totals 9.6 percent of total medical plan costs, Foster
Higgins said.
   At the same time, more employees are screening prospective
employees for substance abuse. Twenty-four percent screened at least
some prospective employees last year, up from 20 percent in 1987,
the survey found.
   Erb said health plans that require employees to share costs are
usually successful in reducing costs to employers. But health
maintenance organizations, which were touted as a way to rein in
expenses, apparently have not succeeded as planned, he said.
   According to the Foster Higgins survey, 59 percent of employers
said premiums paid to health maintenance organizations (HMOs) were
as high as or higher than premiums under traditional health-care
plans.

   Yugo America Inc., the importer of
inexpensive Yugoslav-made cars, is trying to throw its financial
problems into reverse by filing for protection under federal
bankruptcy laws.
   Yugo, its parent company and an affiliated corporation asked a
bankruptcy judge Monday for protection from their creditors. Their
petition said more than 300 companies and individuals may hold
claims against the firms.
   Yugo's sales slipped to 31,546 cars in 1988, a plunge of 35
percent from its 1987 performance.
   Former company president William Prior cited sagging sales and
the loss of dealerships when he resigned in November.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Vincent J. Commisa signed an order Monday
allowing Impex Car Corp. to provide financing and take management
control of the company, said Kenneth A. Rosen, a company attorney.
Impex is an affilliate of Zavodi Crevna Zastava, the Yugoslavian
manufacturer of the Yugo car.
   ``The purpose of the financing is to continue the sale of Yugo
automobiles to dealers and to provide the supply of parts to
dealers,'' said Rosen.
   Yugo was joined in its filing by its parent Global Motors Inc.,
and affiliate Proton America Inc.
   Toma Savic, a Yugo sales representative from Yugoslavia, said
Monday after the National Automobile Dealers Association Convention
in New Orleans the filing could ease Yugo's efforts to stay in the
United States, where it has about 250 dealers.
   Some of those dealers objected to the decision.
   Dick Loehr, a dealer in Kalamazoo, Mich. who also sells other
lines of cars, said Yugo dealers tried to talk company officials out
of filing the bankruptcy papers.
   ``The dealers thought that the investors group (behind Yugo) was
a bottomless pit,'' he said, adding that the dealers had heard
rumors about a possible bankruptcy filing for some time.
   The filing did not shock industry analysts.
   ``It's really not a surprise at all'' said analyst Chris
Cedergren of California-based J.D. Power and Associates.
   ``Global Motors has had some financial difficulties for a while
now,'' Cedergren said. ``They put a great deal of money into Global
Motors hoping they would turn it around.''
   ``It really didn't help that much,'' he said.
   Analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc. said the car's design may have been to blame for the filing.
   `I just think it wasn't attractive and you might as well spend
the extra thousand and get something else,'' she said. ``That's what
happened.''
   Yugo, based in Upper Saddle River, touted its boxy subcompact
cars as the cheapest new auto in the United States when they went on
sale in August 1985 at $3,995.
   Sales topped 39,100 in the first 10 months of 1987, but dropped
to 26,000 in the same period of 1988, according to figures released
by the company.
   Several calls placed Monday to the company were not answered.
   In its filing, Yugo listed $30.5 million in assets and the same
amount in liability and equity. Global Motors listed $27.4 million
in each category. Proton America listed $10,000 in each.
   Mabon Nugent and Co., a New York investment banking company which
invested $10.5 million in Global Motors and owns 33 percent of the
company, said the bankruptcy filing was welcome.
   ``It is appropriate that the Yugoslavian manufacturer of the car
has come forward with support necessary for the company to proceed.
Hopefully, they will be able to complete a plan of reorganization
and continue to serve Yugo dealers and customers,'' the banking
concern said.
   Court papers said the filing was authorized by Marcel Kole, the
company's chief financial officer and acting chief executive officer.
   He said the company is committed to doing business in the United
States.
   In April 1988, Yugo had 300 employees and now has 60, Kole said.

   USAir Group said it would merge its Piedmont

   The combined airlines will operate under the USAir name on and
after that date, USAir Group said in a statement Monday.
   USAir Group bought Piedmont for $1.6 billion in November 1987,
making USAir the nation's seventh-largest airline.
   USAir Group's 1988 earnings were $165 million, or $3.81 a share,
on revenue of $5.71 billion, compared to $194.6 million, or $5.28 a
share, on revenue of $3 billion the year before.

<HEAD>Government Sets Stricter Rules Against Insider Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's government approved Tuesday stricter rules
against insider stock trading, defining the practice clearly and
providing for criminal penalties for the first time.
   The new rules, approved at a Cabinet meeting, will be put into
effect April 1, Finance Ministry officials said.
   ``Amid the ongoing internationalization and popularization of
securities transactions, regulations on insider trading are
indispensable for a sound development of our country's securities
market by increasing the sense of fairness and transparency in the
stock market,'' Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told a news
conference.
   Murayama said that to protect investors, companies should ``make
an effort to positively open up their company information, while
establishing a moral climate to prevent insider trading.''
   In Japan, large-scale insider trading is limited because of the
infrequency of corporate takeovers, analysts say. But leaks of
information about company developments to a limited number of
investors are believed to be frequent, along with stock manipulation
by some large brokerages, financial sources say.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange has become the world's largest stock
market, exceeding New York and London in terms of market
capitalization. But Japanese law previously lacked a clear-cut
definition of insider trading.
   Under the newly revised Securities and Exchange Law, securities
subject to insider trading regulations are company bonds, stocks and
warrant bonds issued by domestic and foreign companies listed on the
stock exchange, the officials said.
   They said the new rules restrict advance leaks of ``important
information'' concerning companies, including decisions made by
board meetings on such matters as mergers and aquisitions,
introduction of new products, financing and cooperative agreements.
   ``Any person who leaks, for example, the news of a company's
merger will face up to six months imprisonment or a fine of 500,000
yen ($3,900),'' said a Finance Ministry official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The new rules say important information will be regarded as
public 12 hours after it has been released to more than two news
organizations. News organizations include general newspapers, news
agencies and broadcasting organizations.
   Japan's recent major stock scandal involved a different type of
practice _ offering selected key politicians and businessmen stock
shares not yet listed for public trading. Once public trading did
begin in the shares of Recruit Cosmos, a real estate company, prices
rose and early buyers made large profits.
   The practice was not illegal, but raised questions of ethics and
disguised bribery.

   Terry Hanks has about 30 Yugos on the lot of
Sundance Chevrolet in Lansing, Mich., and he's wondering what's
going to happen to them.
   Yugo America Inc., the troubled importer of inexpensive
Yugoslavian-made cars, its parent company and an affiliate on Monday
filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws.
   Yugo officials maintain they want to continue doing business in
the United States and that another marketing system would be set up.
The company said the supply of cars, which sell for about $5,000
apiece, would continue along with warranty work.
   That was good news for dealers like Hanks, many of whom tried to
talk the company out of filing the bankruptcy papers.
   ``It's a good little car,'' Hanks said, calling the bankruptcy
filing a ``shame.'' Hanks said in a telephone interview that his
dealership sells about 400 cars a month, 30 of which are Yugos.
   But he also said it was possible the dealership would get rid of
the franchise if Yugo's price rose too much.
   Jeff Van Hill, sales manager of Elhart Dodge-Yugo in Holland,
Mich., agreed that the boxy, economy car is a good seller. ``The
Yugo has done a good job for us,'' he said. ``It's filled a good
(car market) niche.''
   He said the Yugo has outsold every model Dodge offers except its
popular Caravan minivan. Nationwide, Yugo sales dropped 35 percent
in 1988 compared with 1987.
   Bob Mackie, general manager of Classic Chevrolet in Grand Rapids,
Mich., said his organization decided two months ago to drop the car.
   ``We had written a letter to them to resign our franchise,'' he
said. ``Basically, we are sitting with 37 of their automobiles that
they are to purchase back from us.''
   Co-owner Ken Shephard of O'Donnell Motors in San Gabriel, Calif.,
also has bailed out of a Yugo franchise.
   ``We're done with Yugo,'' he said. ``We canceled in August, took
a 90-day extension on parts and warranty and delivered our last Yugo
earlier this month.''
   Shephard said Yugo still owes him about $20,000 for unpaid
warranty claims and factory incentive costs for which he put up the
money.
   ``We thought pretty much in October that we would not see that,''
he said.
   Shephard said he didn't think anything was wrong with the car, it
just didn't sell. But Yugos began leaving his lot when he slashed
the price to $2,900, at a loss of about $2,500 per car.
   ``I'm glad to say that we don't have any more,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in the government's latest auction to the highest
level in three weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 8.33 percent on Monday, up from 8.26
percent last week. An additional $7.2 billion was sold in six-month
bills at an average discount rate of 8.39 percent, up from 8.31
percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since Jan. 9, when three-month bills
sold for 8.36 percent and six-month bills averaged 8.48 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.63 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,789.40 and 8.88 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,575.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 8.97
percent last week from 8.96 percent the previous week.

<TEXT>
   Shamrock Holdings Inc. has filed a
lawsuit to block Polaroid Corp.'s $1.1 billion stock buyback plan,
which analysts believe was designed to thwart a hostile takeover by
the television and radio concern.
   Shamrock, the Disney-owned company that has been pursuing
Polaroid since last summer, filed suit Monday in Delaware State
Court.
   The suit asks the court to prohibit both Polaroid's buyback
program and its plan to issue $300 million in convertible preferred
stock, which also were announced on Monday. Polaroid said it
indicated it had invited two members of the investor group,
Corporate Partners L.P., to join its board of directors.
   In its suit, Shamrock alleges Polaroid's directors ``breached
their fiduciary duties by issuing additional, dilutive voting
securities to persons friendly to management in the face of
Shamrock's announced intention to wage a proxy contest at Polaroid's
upcoming annual meeting.''
   Since July, the instant photography pioneer has been fighting a
hostile buyout offer from Shamrock, which is offering $45 a share in
a tender offer that values Polaroid at about $3.2 billion.
   Shamrock, a television and radio concern owned by the Roy E.
Disney family, also has indicated it will wage a proxy fight for
control of Polaroid's board at the company's annual meeting in May,
and if successful would force the sale of Polaroid either under its
offer or a higher third-party bid.
   Shamrock president and chief executive officer Stanley Gold
called Polaroid's actions irresponsible and a sign of entrenched
management.
   ``The placement of preferred stock, together with the proposed
stock buy-back program, is clearly a defensive action designed to
park even more Polaroid shares in `friendly hands' at the expense of
Polaroid's public shareholders,'' Gold said.
   Polaroid stock closed Monday at $40.62{, up 62{ cents in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Polaroid spokesman Sam Yanes denied the planned stock issue was a
defensive move designed to discourage Burbank-based Shamrock's
advances.
   ``It's designed simply to deliver a portion of the company's
current value while enhancing the growth prospects for its values,''
Yanes said.
   Companies frequently buy their own stock to reduce the number of
shares outstanding and to raise the stock price. Such practices have
become common among companies seeking to discourage takeovers.
   Some analysts said Polaroid's stock buyback was unlikely to
attract shareholders unless the market price of Polaroid stock tops
Shamrock's $45-a-share offer.
   ``There's no incentive for people to sell the Polaroid stock,''
said Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York.
   Henderson said stockholders would do better to tender their stock
to Shamrock and wait for the market price to rise. If the stock
appreciates, he said, stockholders could withdraw the tendered
shares and sell them on the open market.
   ``The catalyst to all this restructuring is Shamrock, whether
(Polaroid officials) admit it or not,'' he said.
   Peter Enderlin, an analyst with New York's Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co., predicted Polaroid's stock price would rise due to the
repurchase plan. He said the company was prepared to pay more than
the $45 offered by Shamrock.
   ``Unless Shamrock comes back with another increase I think
definitely the pendulum has swung to Polaroid protecting their own
company,'' said Charles K. Ryan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets.
   The preferred stock to be issued to Corporate Partners, a firm
managed by New York investors Lester Pollack and Ali Wambold, is
convertible to common stock at a price of $50 a share.
   The group also received warrants to purchase 635,000 shares of
Polaroid common stock at $50 a share.
   Polaroid has 71.6 million common shares outstanding.
   Polaroid's board of directors last week rejected as inadequate
Shamrock's sweetened $45 offer, which includes 9.7 million shares
issued under Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan.
   Shamrock is appealing a Delaware court ruling that upheld the
Polaroid employee stock ownership plan. Polaroid is incorporated in
Delaware.
   Shamrock contends the employee stock was issued specifically to
block a takeover. If the plan is invalidated, Shamrock says, it will
raise its offer to $3.36 billion, or $47 per share.

   The Senate Commerce Committee voted today to
recommend that the Senate confirm President Bush's nomination of
Texas oilman Robert Mosbacher as commerce secretary.
   The committee's voice vote came despite a request by the public
interest lobbying group Common Cause group to delay action on the
nomination of Mosbacher until more is known about the nominee's
fund-raising on behalf of Bush.
   Mosbacher, 61, was warmly received at his confirmation hearing
before the committee last week as he promised to work to increase
U.S. exports and to vigorously enforce laws designed to protect U.S.
business from unfair foreign competition.
   But Common Cause said Monday the committee's vote should be
postponed until more complete information is obtained on corporate
donors to the Republican National Committee. The group says it wants
to ensure against a conflict-of-interest between those corporate
contributors and Mosbacher's work as commerce secretary.
   Common Cause says the RNC has yet to release a full and accurate
list of the people and corporations that gave at least $100,000 each
to the ``Team 100'' fund-raising drive led by Mosbacher, who was
Bush's chief fund-raiser.
   The Republicans released a list of people who had made
contributions, but said much of the money was given on behalf of
corporations that were not identified.
   Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer said the information on
corporate donors was needed ``to allow the public to be able to
identify any possible connections that might arise between the
soft-money contributions and any direct interest the contributors
may end up having in issues before the Commerce Department under Mr.
Mosbacher's leadership.''
   Committee Chairman Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., responded that he
would not delay the vote because it would be wrong to ``raise sand''
over conduct that was allowed under federal election law.
   Hollings did say that he would introduce legislation to limit
spending in federal elections.
   ``The fault here lies with the Congress and not with Mr.
Mosbacher,'' he said.

<HEAD>Unocal Earnings Up Strongly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unocal Corp.'s earnings expanded nearly
five-fold in the final three months of 1988, in part because of
improved earnings from refining and marketing operations and a $98
million after-tax gain on the sale of the company's downtown
headquarters, the company reported.
   The company said Monday other factors contributing to the rise
included increased gains from asset sales and improved chemicals
earnings.
   For the fourth quarter, after-tax profit totaled $141 million, or
$1.21 a share, on revenue of $2.6 billion. That compared with
earnings of $29 million, or 26 cents a share, on revenue of $2.3
billion in the same period in 1987.
   Profits for all of 1988 rose 165 percent to $480 million, or
$4.12 a share, from $181 million, or $1.56 a share in 1987.
   Unocal President and Chief Executive Officer Richard J.
Stegemeier said the stronger earnings were the result of higher
demand for refined products and improved product margins, although
there was some margin slippage at the end of the year.
   The 1988 results also include a $33 million after-tax refund for
overpayment of windfall profit tax and a $13 million gain from the
settlement of certain pension obligations, Stegemeier said.
   He said the company's refining, marketing and transportation
segment recorded earnings of $182 million in 1988, up from $42
million in 1987. For the fourth quarter, earnings were $58 million,
up from $14 million the previous year.

<HEAD>Quarterly Earnings Up 22 Percent, Annual Rise 14 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coca-Cola Co. said Tuesday its net income for
the fourth quarter rose 22 percent as the soft drink company
benefited from increased international sales and a drop in costs.
   Annual earnings for the Atlanta-based company were up 14 percent,
going over the billion-dollar mark for the first time in the
company's 103-year-history. The previous record was $934 million in
1986 before the company spun off its bottling and movie subsidiaries.
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Coke earned $235.5 million
compared with $193 million a year earlier. After a $5.2 million
deduction for preferred stock dividends, the earnings were 65 cents
per share, compared to 52 cents in the 1987 quarter, when there was
no preferred stock deduction.
   Fourth-quarter revenue edged up 1.8 percent to $2.03 billion from
$1.99 billion a year earlier.
   The cost of goods sold fell 8.1 percent for the quarter to $912.8
million from $993.4 million.
   For the year, net income was $1.04 billion from $916.14 million
in 1987. After a $6.43 million preferred stock dividend, earnings
per share were $2.85, compared with $2.43 in 1987 when there was no
preferred stock dividend.
   The company said foreign soft drink shipments grew 7 percent last
year, led by combined volume and operating income increases of 26
percent in Canada and 12 percent in the Pacific.
   Domestically, soft drink concentrate and syrup shipments rose 6
percent and operating income was up 9 percent. Retail case sales
advanced an estimated 5 percent.
   Coca-Cola Foods, which includes Hi-C and Minute Maid brands, had
a 15 percent increase in volume for its boxed fruit juices. However,
volume for frozen orange juice was down 22 percent and chilled
orange juice volume fell 6 percent.
   The company reported a 34 percent increase in operating income
growth for the division, however, because of a restructuring in 1987.
   Coca-Cola reported a 57 percent decline in equity income because
of lower earnings at Columbia Pictures Entertainment resulting from
the one-time writedowns associated with restructuring.
   In December 1987, Coca-Cola's Columbia Pictures subsidiary was
combined with Tri-Star Pictures to form Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc., which is now a free-standing company in which
Coca-Cola owns 49 percent of the stock.
   Coca-Cola also owns 49 percent of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the
largest bottler of Coke products. Those two companies contributed
$29.5 million in income for the quarter and $48.3 million for the
year.
   During 1988, the company said it repurchased 18.9 million shares
of common stock, decreasing outstanding shares by 3.4 percent. In
all, the company has bought back 25.5 million of the announced
repurchase of 40 million shares.

   Futures prices for grain and soybeans advanced
sharply in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Prices were supported by higher than expected weekly export
figures and talk of a report from Sparks Commodities, a private crop
analyst, that pegged Argentina's soybean crop lower than USDA
estimates, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Also boosting prices was a weather forecast calling for colder
temperatures in growing areas for U.S. winter wheat, he said.

   Livestock and meat futures prices were mostly higher on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   In early trading, cattle was .02 cent to .13 cent higher, with
the contract for delivery in February at 74.45 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .17 cent lower to .05 higher, with March at 84.25 cents

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Mine Workers today agreed to extend
its deadline and continue negotiations with the Pittston Coal Group,
averting a walkout by 1,700 miners scheduled for midnight tonight.
   Union President Richard L. Trumka told a Washington news
conference the union would accept a request by the governors of
Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia to call off the strike deadline
in favor of continued negotiations.
   Govs. Gerald Baliles of Virginia, Gaston Caperton of West
Virginia and Wallace Wilkinson of Kentucky made the request last
week, asking the union to agree to a 30-to-60-day cooling-off period.
   Trumka promised to comply with that request.
   At the same time, however, Trumka announced the latest
development in the union's ``corporate campaign'' of trying to put
pressure on Pittston through protests and other actions against the
company and its business partners.
   Today's target was Crestar Financial Corp., one of five banks
that in December 1987 extended to Pittston a $100 million line of
credit. That was one month before the expiration of the miners'
contract. They have been working wothout a contract since.
   Trumka said the Crestar boycott began today with the withdrawal
of $29.7 million from the bank _ $23 million by the Bakery and
Confectionary Union and Industry International Pension Fund and $6.7
million by the UMW.
   ``I anticipate that millions more will be withdrawn from Crestar
to protest its financial support of Pittston,'' Trumka said.
   In a letter to the three governors announcing the extension of
the strike deadline, Trumka thanked them for their support and said
the union for the most part has ``walked the road alone'' in its
search for a fair settlement to the contract squabble with Pittston.
   And he again called on Pittston chief executive officer Paul W.
Douglas to meet face-to-face with him to discuss the negotiations.
   The Pittston Co., based in Greenwich, Conn., is the corporate
parent of the coal group, based in Lebanon, Va.
   Miners have been on the job with no contract at Pittston since
last Feb. 1. After Pittston refused to sign a wage agreement the UMW
reached at other major eastern producers.
   The sides met again Monday, but dd not resolve their differences.
   Over the past week, the company has been considering a union
contract offer made last Tuesday in response to an offer Pittston
made on Nov. 9. During the year of negotiations, each side had
accused the other of hindering progress by refusing to bargain in
good faith.
   Pittston had said repeatedly it planned to operate through a
strike, perhaps by hiring permanent replacement miners. The union
responded with a ``corporate strategy'' in which it tried to
pressure Pittston through demonstrations and other actions against
its business partners.

<HEAD>State Gaming Officials Want to Bar Investment Company From Casino
Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State gaming officials moved today to bar
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. from doing business with New Jersey's
casino industry because of the firm's involvement in a major Wall
Street corruption scandal.
   Anthony J. Parrillo, director of the New Jersey Division of
Gaming Enforcement, issued a statement saying the division filed a
complaint with the Casino Control Commission seeking suspension of
the investment company's casino business dealings, a lucrative
source of business for Drexel.
   Parrillo said the gaming division wants Drexel's business stopped
until a federal fraud investigation surrounding the firm is
completed.
   Drexel has earned fees totaling more than $120 million by
marketing securities valued at more than $3 billion for the Atlantic
City casinos, according to Parrillo, whose division is the
investigative arm of the state attorney general's office dealing
with the gaming industry.
   Last month Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay
a record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle the biggest
securities fraud probe in history.
   Most of the charges concerned Drexel's relationship with Ivan F.
Boesky, a one-time leading takeover speculator who turned states
evidence in late 1986 after admitting to extensive insider trading
in stocks.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, flanked by
the U.S. attorneys from New York, Chicago and Kansas City, today
announced formation of special task forces to target ``crime in the
suites,'' primarily securities and commodities fraud.
   The Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Forces, including 15
additional assistant U.S. attorneys, will be located in six cities:
New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Kansas City and
Denver.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in New York and U.S. Attorney
Anton Valukas in Chicago already have undertaken substantial
investigations of the markets in those two cities.
   ``We are undertaking to bring this additional firepower to bear
on behalf of investors who might otherwise run the risk of being
defrauded or lose confidence in the market,'' Thornburgh said.
   He said the task forces were being formed to ``combat what can
aptly be called crime in the suites.'' Fraud is being committed
``under the guise of respectability in the financial and securities
markets,'' he said.
   In addition, Thornburgh said the Treasury loses more than $90
billion a year as a result of tax fraud, and white-collar crime has
been a factor in many recent business failures, including many of
the bank and savings and loan closings.
   There was no immediate word on how much the new effort will cost.
Those involved in the task forces will be senior, experienced
prosecutors who will be replaced in their current jobs by new
attorneys, Edward S.G. Dennis, assistant attorney general in charge
of the Justice Department's criminal division, said at a news
conference.
   The task forces will concentrate on the most complex and
difficult frauds, including stock loan frauds, precious metals
fraud, ``parking'' of securities with buyers concealing how much of
a stake they have in a company's stock, and major bank and brokerage
frauds, plus tax evasion, obstruction of justice and perjury,
Thornburgh said.
   ``These investigations are difficult and require the
sophisticated efforts of experienced prosecutors,'' Thornburgh said.
``They are not made by breaking down the door and seizing the
evidence.''
   Agents from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal
Revenue Service, the Postal Inspection Service, the FBI and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission also will be involved in the
probes.
   Giuliani, who is leaving his post today after five years, made a
name for himself in part by attacking insider trading on Wall Street
and has long called for additional money to uncover fraud in the
securities markets.
   Valukas of Chicago supervised a two-year undercover investigation
of the nation's largest commodity markets, resulting in allegations
that as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated
customers and profited themselves in illegal trades.
   Under the new task forces, the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan will get six additional assistant U.S. attorneys, while
the offices in Chicago and Los Angeles will get three each, and San
Francisco, Kansas City and Denver will get one apiece. An
unspecified number of investigators, paralegal workers and other
support personnel will be added to those offices as well.
   In addition to Giuliani, Valukas and Dennis, Thornburgh was
joined at the news conference by Benito Romano, who becomes interim
U.S. attorney for Manhattan on Wednesday after Giuliani steps down,
and Robert Ulrich, U.S. attorney in Kansas City and chairman of the
attorney general's U.S. Attorneys Advisory Committee.

<HEAD>Varity Makes New Offer for Fruehauf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada's Varity Corp. has made a new offer for
Fruehauf Corp. that would be more favorable for Fruehauf
stockholders than Fruehauf's own recapitalization plan, Varity said
Tuesday.
   The total amount of the offer was undisclosed. Varity and
Fruehauf officials did not immediately return phone calls seeking
details.
   Varity called off earlier negotiations on acquisition of Fruehauf
in October, citing only its review of Fruehauf's records and assets.
   Varity, formerly Massey-Ferguson, is a Toronto-based farm and
industrial machinery maker.
   Fruehauf makes truck trailers and automotive and maritime
products, and its Kelsey Hayes subsidiary is a leading supplier of
antilock braking systems. Fruehauf has struggled with debt since a
1986 leveraged buyout and reported a net loss of $41.5 million for
1987.
   After Varity's earlier offer was called off, Fruehauf said in
December it would propose recapitalization, deferring some debt and
increasing cash available for operations. It also said it would
explore other alternatives presented to the company.
   The new Varity offer came in a letter dated Monday from Victor
Rice, chairman and chief executive officer of Varity, to T.Neal
Combs, vice chairman and chief executive officer of Fruehauf.
   Rice proposed that Varity acquire Fruehauf in an exchange of
Varity shares for Fruehauf stock. Holders of Fruehauf notes and
debentures would receive a combination of Varity shares and new
Fruehauf debt guaranteed by Varity.
   The offer would be more favorable for stockholders than
Fruehauf's proposed recapitalization, he said. ``They would not be
dependent for the value of their securities on the future operations
of Fruehauf alone.''
   Rice said the offer would remain open until 5 p.m. Feb. 17.

<HEAD>Facsimile Machines Transform Life But Can Create Headaches _ and
Lawsuits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Facsimile machines, the latest office
rage, have made it easier and possibly more fun for workers to work,
stay in touch, and even order lunch, but they also have fallen prey
to human goofs and greed.
   A presidential candidate used a fax machine to enter the race at
the last minute. A Boston radio station accepts contest entries by
fax _ and notifies winners the same way.
   But a leading retailer recently lost a $73 million lawsuit in
federal court here partly because a confidential document was faxed
to the wrong place, and irritation is growing as ``junk fax''
increases.
   Still, ``Once you have one you can't live without it, and you use
it more and more,'' said Elliot King, co-author of ``The Book of
Fax: An Impartial Guide to Buying &amp; Using Fascimile Machines.''
   The machines convert a page of information into an electronic
format, then transmit it via telephone line to another machine on
the other end, where it is decoded and printed. The average office
fax costs $1,000 to $4,000.
   More than 4 million fax machines will be purchased by 1991, and
sales are expected to grow at 30 percent a year well into the 1990s,
according to King's book.
   ``To a lot of people the fax machine has become a fact of life in
the office,'' said Barbara Crouse, advertising and promotion
director for Boston's WROR-FM.
   The radio station has been using the fax to entice office workers
to listen. It has been running a contest asking workers to fax in
the funniest thing found lying around the office. The chuckle of the
day wins, with the victor receiving notification from the station
via fax.
   ``They not only have to send us the fax, but they have to watch
their fax machines to see if they've won,'' said Crouse.
   Office workers can also use the machines to place lunch orders at
``fax food'' restaurants.
   ``We do a lot of delivery and takeout and for them to just fax
over their order, it goes through less hands and it keeps the order
more correct,'' said Evie Young, manager of Maxine's Seafood Cafe in
Los Angeles. ``It saves us in tying up phone lines.''
   She said the restaurant, which got its fax machine in October,
gets about half its takeout requests via fax, roughly 15 to 20
orders per day.
   The portable fax opens up a whole new world to faxaholics.
   ``I had a guy come in here once who wanted a portable one so he
could take it golfing,'' said Anthony J. Villaloando, owner of
Citifax Information Systems in Northbrook, Ill.
   Portable fax machines were used constantly during the
presidential election, said Tad Devine, director of delegate
selection for Michael Dukakis' Democratic primary campaign and
campaign coordinator for vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen.
   Both candidates traveled in planes equipped with fax machines.
They also had portable fax for use in their hotel rooms, he said.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri almost missed his chance to run
for the Democratic presidential nomination when his filing papers
failed to show up for the primary deadline.
   ``When it was not there late that afternoon, his campaign was
contacted by the secretary of state in Oklahoma and Gephardt's
campaign sent in a fax,'' said Devine.
   But fax fiascos can be expensive.
   A federal lawsuit that ended in a $73 million judgment against K
mart Corp. earlier this month was initiated when a clerk mistakenly
faxed a confidential document to Fashion House, a Pawtucket-based
merchandise wholesaler.
   The document, an estimate of the commissions owed, was intended
for K mart headquarters in Troy, Mich. K mart is appealing the
judgment.
   ``It is a danger,'' agrees King. ``It's like mail without an
envelope and you can make a lot of mistakes.''
   Just like the U.S. Postal Service, junk mail is a problem.
   A Connecticut legislator recently proposed legislation that would
ban the unsolicited use of fax machines to send advertising messages.
   ``It's a really effective way for people to direct sales and
services,'' King said, explaining the 10 percent return on mass
faxings is more than double that of bulk mailings.
   In addition, the ``fax attacks'' cost the solicitor less money
than mailings because there are no printing, envelope stuffing or
postage fees. The owners of the targeted telecopier, however, gets
stung $3 to $4 for the price of paper, printing and manpower, said
King.
   Daniel Fishman, King's co-author, envisons another problem _
fax-a-porn.
   ``Some enterprising young person sometime will enter the business
of pornography,'' he said. ``Call up and get a pornographic
photograph'' faxed to you.

   Whittaker Corp. says it expects the company or
a subsidiary will be charged in a federal investigation, apparently
the Pentagon fraud investigation.
   The company said in a terse news release Monday that Justice
Department investigators had presented evidence that ``certain
employees or a unit of Whittaker caused money to be paid to a
government employee in connection with certain government
contracts.''
   ``Whittaker believes that it is likely that the investigation
will result in criminal charges being brought against Whittaker or
one of its subsidiaries,'' the release continued.
   The company didn't name the employees or the subsidiary, but
Whittaker's now-closed command and control systems unit in
Farmington, Ark., was searched in connection with the probe in June.
   Investigators have been examining dealings between the company
and Jack Sherman, a Marine Corps contracting official who pleaded
guilty last week ot taking bribes of $43,500 from an unidentified
industry consultant serving as a government informer, the Wall
Street Journal reported.
   Investigators found documents showing contact between Sherman and
an official of Lee Telecommunications Corp., a company that
Whittaker bought in 1986, the Los Angeles Times reported.

<HEAD>USX Reports Fourth-Quarter Turnaround</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. on Tuesday reported profits of $158
million in the fourth quarter of 1988, saying a rejuvenated steel
division helped it rebound from a $14 million loss in the same
period a year earlier.
   The nation's largest steelmaker said the profit, equal to 55
cents a share, came on sales of $4.4 billion, up from $4.3 billion
in the last three months of 1987.
   USX Chairman David Roderick attributed the turnaround in part to
the company's improved steel division, USS.
   Operating income there was $501 million on sales of $5.8 billion,
four times higher than the $125 million on sales of $3.7 billion
reported for 1987.
   USX, formerly known as U.S. Steel, also is the parent of Marathon
Oil Co. and Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp.
   For the entire year, USX said earnings tripled to $756 million,
or $2.62 a share, on sales of $16.9 billion. That compares to
profits of $219 million, or 54 cents a share, on sales of $14.9
billion in 1987.
   ``All of our major segments were profitable in 1988, and we
expect improved profitability in both our steel and energy segments
in 1989,'' Roderick said in a statement. ``We are stronger
financially now than in any recent year.''
   Operating income from energy operations rose 7 percent, to $475
million from $444 million in 1987, despite continued trouble at
Texas Oil &amp; Gas.
   The unit reported losses of $31 million for 1988 and $7 million
for the fourth quarter, compared with operating income of $2 million
for 1987 and a loss of $4 million for the 1987 fourth quarter.
   USX blamed diminished margins on gas gathering and weak crude oil
prices for the Texas Oil &amp; Gas losses.

<HEAD>Cut The Capital Gains Tax?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It appears that George Bush won't give up on his
idea of cutting the capital gains tax, which pretty much guarantees
an explosive battle in Congress.
   That battle will erupt because capital gains are seen as
something that involve the rich. But either that notion is false or
millions of Americans now qualify as rich, and the list grows larger
with every year.
   In truth, capital gains concern anyone who inherited or purchased
a few shares of stock or a house or who in almost any other way
built a financial estate through ingenuity, hard work or just luck.
   Under the 1986 tax act, the capital gains tax was raised from a
maximum of 20 percent to 28 percent for all earners of capital
gains. The increase was 40 percent for wealthy taxpayers, but 100
percent for many poorer taxpayers, who real capital gains rate was
only 14 percent or 15 percent.
   It brought capital gains taxes in line with taxes on ordinary
income.
   That was bad enough, said critics, who also observed other quirks
in the situation _ that such taxes can be applied to income never
made, to buying power that never existed, and to funds a taxpayer
never got a chance to use.
   Definition: Capital gains are profits realized from the sale of
capital assets such as securities or real estate.
   Often they involve risk, and usually they are the results of
long-term investments. For this and other reasons, including the
nation's need for such capital investments, gains generally were
taxed at less than ordinary income.
   Consider the consequences now of taxing such long-term gains at
the same rate as ordinary income _ income that is taxed during the
same year in which it is earned.
   Assume an investment of $5,000 in stock held for seven years. If
the appreciation averages 10 percent over that time the investor
will have about doubled his money. The capital gains would be
$5,000; the tax about $1,400.
   While it appears the invester earned 10 percent, he really earned
only 6 percent because the value of the dollar changed in that time.
Inflation eroded it at a rate of 4 percent a year, an assumption but
a very safe one.
   At 6 percent a year money will not double in seven years. The
$5,000 sum will grow to about $7,100 in buying power. But the
investor will pay capital gains taxes as if it had grown to $10,000.
He will pay $1,400 in taxes.
   Deducting the taxes from the inflation-adjusted total earned
leaves him with just $5,600 or $5,700 _ an average annual gain of
$100 or less for having risked his money and invested his savings in
the American economy.
   The example is a modest one. Consider, for example, a person who
put some money away back in 1970 with the idea of using it for
retirement. The investment has since tripled in value to a very tidy
sum. Or has it?
   Consumer price inflation in 1970 was 5.9 percent, followed by 4.3
percent in 1971, 3.3 percent in 1972. Not too bad, but then it hit
6.2 percent in 1973 and 11 percent in 1974. It never fell below 5.8
percent through 1978.
   Thereafter, the tale becomes grim. Three successive years of
double-digit inflation hit, the worst of these years being 1980,
when official consumer price inflation measured year to year struck
13.5 percent.
   By the year 1983, the value of the 1970 dollar had been cut in
half and, of course, it has been cut additionally since then, even
though inflation has been restrained to an ``acceptable'' 3- to 5
percent a year.
   The 1970 investor has allegedly tripled his money. Assuming an
investment of $5,000, he now has more than $15,000, although
sensible people know that in 1970 dollars it is worth less than half
that, or about $7,000.
   Nevertheless, should that investor sell, he has a $10,000 capital
gain on which taxes must be paid. And that tax will levied at the
same rate at which money currently earned is taxed. that is, as if
it had current buying power.
   In short, the investor will be liable for $2,800 tax on what in
effect is $7,000 in terms of the 1970 dollar. He ends up with a net
loss.

<HEAD>Control Data Posts $12.8 Million Loss In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. on Tuesday reported a fourth-quarter loss of
$12.8 million and annual profits of only $1.7 million, while its
chairman forecast another disappointing year for 1989.
   The fourth-quarter results of the Bloomington, Minn.-based
computer maker compared to net earnings in the same period a year
ago of $10.8 million, or 26 cents a share. Sales for the quarter of
$933 million were slightly ahead of last year's $927 million.
   It was the second consecutive quarter of losses after four
profitable quarters.
   For the year, Control Data's net income dropped to 3 cents a
share on sales of $3.6 billion from the 1987 level of $19.3 million,
or 45 cents a share, on sales of $3.4 billion.
   The computer maker suffered from poor results in its mainframe,
supercomputer and semiconductor businesses, Chairman Robert Price
said.
   ``Although we anticipate the majority of Control Data businesses
to be profitable in 1989, the company's overall operating
performance will continue to be disappointing until we fix the
problems that undermined 1988 results,'' Price said. ``The goal for
the coming year is to resolve those problems and lay a foundation
that is the basis of strong performance in subsequent years.''
   Mainframe computer shipments in 1988 were hurt by delays in
getting critical logic ships from a supplier and by soft demand,
especially in the United States, Price said.
   In July the company temporarily shut down several of its
mainframe plants and temporarily idled 7 percent of its work force
in response to the trouble.
   The company's new ETA Systems supercomputer subsidiary had poor
1988 results, and semiconductor revenues were off partly because the
data storage market continues to be weak, he said.
   Nancy Foltz, a spokeswoman for the company, said layoffs,
attrition and the sale of some businesses in 1988 resulted in a 2.3
percent decrease in Control Data's work force from 34,500 employees
at the end of 1987 to 33,700 at the end of 1988. In addition, the
company has told its 27,000 U.S. employees that they must take five
days off without pay in the first quarter of this year.
   Other changes at Control Data included changes in top management
in December, including the appointment of Lawrence Perlman as
president.

<HEAD>GATT Panel Backs EEC In Dispute Over U.S. Trade Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international trade panel has
recommended the United States amend its Tariff Act of 1930 to make
it comply with international trade rules, the EEC Commission said
Tuesday.
   It said a disputes panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, the world trade body, found Section 337 of the act violates
international trade rules.
   The section deals with the right of the U.S. International Trade
Commission to rule on patent violations by importers.
   The disputes panel said by comparison patent violations of
U.S.-produced goods go to federal court where accused parties have a
better chance to defend themselves than those before the ITC.
   The panels' finding will be discussed by the full GATT Council on
Feb. 8, EEC Commission spokesman Nico Wegter said.
   ``The commission is, of course, pleased with the fact that the
panel shares the view of the commission'' that the United States
violates international trade rules.
   Officials at the U.S. mission to the EEC declined to comment on
the ruling that was issued in December but was not made public
unitil Tuesday.
   The panel's ruling stems from a 10-year-old dispute between Akzo
NV, the Dutch chemicals group, and Du Pont Co. of the United States
over patent rights for aramid fibers. These synthetic fibers are
used in the automotive, aerospace, defence and construction
industries.
   In November 1985, the ITC blocked imports into the United States
of AKZO's aramid fibers saying the company had violated Du Pont's
patent rights.
   Akzo complained to the EEC commission about the procedure used by
Du Pont to seek protection from foreign competitors under section
337 of the Tariffs Act.
   In 1987, the commission found the U.S. law to amount to an unfair
trade practice. It took the issue to GATT where a special disputes
panel was formed later that year.
   The commission said Tuesday if the GATT Council, which is made up
of officials of the 100 or so GATT member states, adopts the panel's
report, the United States must take the ``necessary measures to
rectify as quickly as possible the present situation.''
   A spokesman for the EC chemical federation, Cefic, said AKZO and
Du Pont had settled their dispute while the investigation was
continuing.
   He welcomed the ruling on Section 337 saying it represented was
``increasingly burdensome'' for EEC businesses and said the panel's
ruling was ``a victory'' for the EEC.

<HEAD>French Commission Urges Criminal Probe Of Suspicious Stock Buys</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's stock market watchdog agency on Tuesday
recommended a criminal investigation of the insider trading scandal
that has embarrassed the Socialist government, but said it could not
identify individuals guilty of leaking information that led to
suspicious stock purchases.
   The Commission des Operations de Bourse said Max Theret, a
businessman with close ties to the governing Socialist Party, made
``eminently suspicious'' purchases of stock in the U.S. company
Triangle Industries Inc. just before it was acquired by the French
state-owned firm Pechiney SA.
   The COB, in an unusual public report, said explanations by Theret
and his associates were contradictory and apparently were made up
after the fact, and it appeared that Theret or another official of
his investment firm, the Compagnie Parisienne de Placements,
received an inside tip of the imminent takeover.
   The agency recommended a criminal investigation, but said it was
not able to identify who, in or out of the government, might have
provided the information for inside trading by Theret or others.
   The COB has no enforcement or punishment power, and has no power
to investigate outside of France. The agency can, however,
investigate locally and recommend prosecution to the state
prosecutor's office.
   Theret's investment firm bought 32,300 shares of Triangle stock
just before the sale to Pechiney and made a profit of $1.4 million.
   Theret has said he decided to buy Triangle stock based on his
research into the packaging industry and has denied getting inside
tips.
   The commission also said a close friend of President Francois
Mitterrand, Roger-Patrice Pelat, was among the investors who
profited by purchasing Triangle stock at about $10 a share in the
days just before Pechiney's $56 a share buyout offer on Nov. 21.
   Pelat, his wife and sons made more than $350,000 in the deal, the
commission said, but it did not accuse Pelat of insider trading or
any other wrongdoing.
   The COB said it found ``serious, precise and concordant''
indications of illegal activity, but said it could not identify
anyone guilty of leaking word of the deal.
   Commission chairman Jean Farge acknowledged his investigators had
been unable to track all the suspicious trading, some of which was
conducted by corporations based in the Caribbean or Switzerland.
   Because Pechiney is state-owned, several high government
officials were kept informed of the negotiations with Triangle and
government approval was required.
   Premier Michel Rocard and other Socialist leaders have responded
to the burgeoning scandal in recent weeks by saying previous
conservative governments were involved in more serious scandals than
this one, while promising to bring out the truth and punish any
wrongdoing.
   The affair led earlier this month to the resignation of Alain
Boublil, Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy's top aide, the
government official most closely involved with the takeover. Boublil
said he wanted to be free to defend himself more vigorously.
   A series of newspaper and magazine articles strongly have hinted
that Boublil leaked the information.
   Pelat, who has known Mitterrand since their days together in a
German prisoner-of-war camp and in the French Resistance, is one of
six people identified in the report as having bought shares during
the few days after the Pechiney-Triangle deal was reached and
reported to the French government, but before it was made public.
   Pelat's stock moves, and nearly all other elements of the
commission's report, had been widely reported in French news
accounts of the scandal, which has dominated the political scene for
weeks.
   But the commission report, with its extensive examination of
Theret's explanation for his purchases, was seen as likely to give
new political impetus to the scandal.

<HEAD>Boom Appears Headed for Bust: U.S. Population Growth Likely to Peak
in 2038</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The population boom appears headed for a bust
in the United States, with Census Bureau experts projecting Tuesday
that the number of Americans will stop growing in 50 years and then
begin to shrink.
   The prime reason: A decline in births as the post-World War II
Baby Boom matures.
   The aging of that giant generation means that never again will
America have as many women in the prime childbearing ages of 18 to
34 as it now does, census demographer Gregory Spencer said.
   ``After 1995 the population may grow more slowly than ever before
_ more slowly than even during the Great Depression of the 1930s,''
Spencer said.
   His study estimated that the nation's population could rise
gradually from the current 247 million to a peak of nearly 302
million by the year 2038 and then begin to decline.
   That is the middle projection of a series of some 30 different
possibilities included in the study.
   The lowest growth estimate would have the population peak at
264.5 million in the year 2020 before starting to decline, while the
high-growth scenario would have the nation at 501 million and still
growing in 2080.
   While wary of calling one series ``most likely,'' Spencer said
that in general, when people ask what the population will be like in
the future, he gives them the middle series of projections.
   The bureau compiles 30 sets of estimates, however, in an attempt
to account for varying possibilities in birth rates, death rates,
differences between races and ethnic groups, immigration and so
forth.
   According to the middle series, the U.S. population will climb
for 50 years, peaking in 2038, and then begin a modest decline.
   During that coming half-century the overall increase is expected
to total about 56 million, nearly the same amount the U.S. grew
during the last 25 years.
   After that peak, shrinkage should occur, although it will be
``really quite modest,'' Spencer said, with the population falling
by only about 10 million over the subsequent 42 years.
   ``So, obviously, it wouldn't take very much to make this not
happen,'' he added.
   The projection for slower growth, followed by decline, stems from
the fact that ``we have had fertility in this country below
replacement level since the mid-1970s,'' Spencer said.
   Currently each women has a lifetime average of about 1.8 births,
while it takes 2.1 to keep population stable.
   ``The main thing keeping the number of births up is the sheer
enormous number of women of childbearing age,'' Spencer said.
   But those Baby Boomers are now heading into older age groups that
tend to have fewer children, while a much smaller group of young
women is coming along into the childbearing ages.
   Already the number of women aged 18 to 34 has begun to decline,
the study said. Peaking at 35.3 million in 1985 it slipped to 35.2
million by 1987 and is expected to drop to 34.7 million by 1990 and
by 2080 to be below 30 million.
   Spencer noted that the population projections assume that
fertility will become slightly higher in the next few years.
   This is based on the expectation that many women who have
postponed families while attending school and launching careers will
decide to have children before they become too old to reproduce.
   The report also says the nation's elderly population, which has
attracted so much attention in recent years, is expected to grow
more slowly after the mid-1990s, and then accelerate again after
2010.
   That slowing is expected because the small generation born in the
Depression and war years of the 1930s and 1940s will be moving into
this age group.
   But once the postwar Baby Boom reaches that plateau, the elderly
segment will resume the rapid growth it has seen in recent years.
   Other findings of the new report include:
   _The share of the population under age 35 may never again be as
large as it is now _ 55 percent. That percentage is expected to drop
to 48 percent in 2000, 46 percent in 2010 and 41 percent in 2030.
   _The white population may begin to decline in 40 years while the
black and other races population is expected to continue increasing.
   _By the year 2030, the population could include as many as 32
million immigrants who entered the country after 1986, and their
descendants _ 12 percent of the population.
   Here is a rundown of the projected U.S. population in coming
years, based on the middle set of estimates. The Census Bureau
estimated the U.S. population at 246,879,546 as of Jan. 1 of this
year.

<HEAD>BP Shareholders Approve Buyback of Kuwait Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum PLC shareholders on Tuesday
approved a $4.2 billion buyback of more than half the 1.32 billion
BP shares owned by the government of Kuwait.
   Approval of the repurchase followed a British government order
earlier this month that the Kuwait Investment Office, the
London-based investment arm of the Kuwaiti government, reduce its
21.68 percent ownership in the petroleum company to 9.9 percent.
   An unexpectedly large turnout at the special meeting and the
number of proxy votes cast ``show small shareholders have had an
interest in what we've been doing and approve,'' BP Chairman Peter
Walters said after the vote.
   Kuwait had been ordered by the British government to dispose of
its BP interest above 9.9 percent within three years, but BP said
the buyback would remove the element of uncertainty over the pending
disposal and ultimately aid the performance of the company's shares.
   The British government's order to the Kuwaitis came after a
ruling in October by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that the
big Kuwaiti holding could ``operate against the public interest''
because of Kuwait's membership in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   The Kuwait Investment Office built up its holding by buying
partly paid BP stock in the months following the government's 7.2
billion pound, or $13.2 billion, public offering of BP shares in
October 1987.
   The sale by the Conservative government under its policy of
privatization coincided with the stock market crash. The offering,
which included the government's remaining 31.5 percent stake in BP,
was seriously undersubscribed.
   Although the price BP will pay the Kuwaitis amounts to 305 pence
for each of the 790 million shares owned by Kuwait, BP will
effectively pay 247 pence a share because of tax credits.
   Walters said the repurchase would be completed by mid-March.

   Futures prices for grain and soybeans were sharply

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of unemployed Norwegians nearly
doubled in one year to a postwar record with 4 percent out of work,
the government announced Tuesday.
   ``The registered unemployment rate increased to an extraordinary
level (in January), and the figures are the highest that have been
registered in postwar time,'' the government labor agency said.
   Officials at Norges Bank, the central bank, had predicted the
increase, calling it a ``necessary evil'' in an austerity program
aimed at reducing inflation and other economic problems.
   The official January figures of 86,600 jobless did not include
36,700 people involved in government-funded work programs.
   Norway went into a sharp economic decline in the mid-1980s with
the drop in prices of oil, a major export. The last unemployment
record was in January 1985, when 79,700 people were officially
listed as jobless.
   The labor agency said the January figure was up 16,900 from last
month and up 44,000 from a year earlier.

<HEAD>Borden Posts 15.4 Percent Gain In Fourth-Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borden Inc. said Tuesday its fourth-quarter
profit rose 15.4 percent despite drought-related costs that severely
affected the company's dairy products earnings.
   For the three-month period ended Dec. 31, Borden's net income
totaled $93.9 million, or $1.27 a share, up from $81.3 million, or
$1.10 a share in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 9.9 percent
to $1.98 billion from $1.8 billion in the 1987 quarter.
   For all of 1988, the giant food producer posted a 16.8 percent
increase in after-tax profit to $311.9 million, or $4.22 a share,
from $267.1 million, or $3.62 a share in the previous year. The
company's revenue for the year totaled $7.2 billion, up 11 percent
from $6.5 billion in 1987.
   Borden Chairman R.J. Ventres attributed the latest gains to
``internal business growth spurred by the benefits of
acquisitions,'' including the purchase a year ago of The Prince Co.,
which makes pasta products.
   Strong performances by the company's Snacks and International
Consumer Products Division and the Grocery and Specialty Products
Division, including Eagle Brand products, were largely responsible
for Borden's yearlong gains, the company said.
   But drought-related costs resulted in a 12 percent slump in
operating income for the company's dairy sector, to $102.3 million
in 1988 from $116.3 million in 1987.
   Borden said profit margins were squeezed, especially in the
second half, by unprecedented cost jumps for raw milk.
   ``Fierce competition at the retail level delayed cost recovery in
product pricing,'' Borden said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The volume of help-wanted advertisements in major
newspapers rose slightly in December, indicating little change in
employers' hiring plans, a business research group said Tuesday.
   The Conference Board said its Help Wanted Advertising Index rose
to 161 last month from 157 in November and 156 in the year-ago
month. The board said the index fluctuated in a narrow range
throughout the year.
   The seasonally adjusted index equaled 100 in 1967.
   The index measures volume of classified ads in 51 major
newspapers nationwide and is sensitive to changes in the demand for
labor and general business conditions.
   Conference Board Economist Ken Goldstein said, ``The monthly
survey data show no change in the labor market conditions that have
prevailed for the last year or so. But a change may not be that far
off.''
   Goldstein predicted there may be a slowing in the job market in
1988 following a year in which unemployment hit a 14-year low.

   The stock market was higher in late trading
today, rebounding a bit from its earlier decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 5.89 points at
2,330.00 at 3 p.m. EST, after posting declines through the trading
session. Advancing issues edged out declines by around 4-to-3 on the

   Many traders continue to express confidence in the strength of
the rally, though, believing today's pullback to be temporary.

   Church, labor and business organizations opened
a campaign Tuesday to inform millions of low-income working families
that government checks of up to $874 a year may be theirs for the
asking.
   ``Money? For me? From the IRS? You're kidding!!!'' read posters
and ads aimed at spreading the word about the earned-income tax
credit. ``If you're thinking about not filing a federal income tax
return because you don't owe any income tax ... think again! They
may owe you.''
   ``We are concerned that millions of low-income working families
with children may miss out on a valuable benefit they have earned,''
Robert Greenstein told a news conference in announcing the drive.
   Greenstein is director of the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a non-profit Washington organization that tracks
government actions affecting low- and middle-income Americans. The
center is coordinating the campaign to make sure that all the 11
million families eligible for the tax credit get it.
   Dozens of organizations are participating in the campaign,
ranging from Vietnam Veterans of America, to the Edison Electric
Institute, to the Children's Defense Fund.
   About 6.3 million families claimed the credit on returns filed in
1987. If all those eligible claimed it this year, it would cost the
Treasury about $6 billion.
   Greenstein said the special effort to educate poorer families is
necessary because many are simply unaware the tax credit exists.
Although the 1986 tax overhaul expanded the credit and made it
available to more families, the new law also removed up to 6 million
poor people from the tax rolls and exempted most of them from
withholding and from even having to file a tax return.
   Greenstein fears _ and the Internal Revenue Service supports his
conclusion _ that because they had no tax withheld, millions of
lower-income families will not file a return. They, thus, would miss
the credit.
   The tax-rate reductions in the 1986 law became fully effective
for the first time in 1988, and many low-income workers are
receiving for the first time a W-2 form indicating they had no tax
withheld.
   The credit is available to working families who have at least one
child living at home and had 1988 income of less than $18,576. The
credit is for 14 percent of the first $6,240 of earnings _ chiefly
wages and tips. The maximum credit of $874 is allowed until income
exceeds $9,840; the credit then decreases until income reaches
$18,576, when it disappears.
   The benefit is unique because it can exceed a family's total
income-tax liability, even if the liability is zero. For example, a
woman with one child could have earned $6,200 last year, had no tax
withheld and owed no tax. If she files a return, the IRS will mail
her a check for $870.
   ``We think it is almost a crime if the people who are entitled to
these benefits don't obtain them,'' Kenneth Young, executive
assistant to the president of the AFL-CIO, told the news conference.
The labor federation and several of its union are participating in
the campaign.
   Young noted that both spouses in a family could earn the minimum
wage (about $6,900 each) and the family could still qualify for a
substantial credit.
   Sharon Daly, head of domestic social policy for the U.S. Catholic
Conference, said each of the nation's 189 dioceses will be asked to
spread the word about the credit, including using inserts in church
bulletins.
   The campaign also seeks to inform eligible families that they can
receive the credit in their paychecks throughout the year rather
than having to wait until the end of the year for a lump-sum
payment. Fewer than 1 percent of the families eligible for the
credit receive the advance payments.
   Greenstein also noted that a person who was eligible for the
credit before 1988 but failed to claim it may be able to file
retroactively and receive the benefit for up to three years in the
past.

   StarSignal Inc. has introduced what it
said is the first facsimile machine capable of sending full-color
pictures over conventional telephone lines.
   The company said Monday that the device, with a $19,000 price
tag, will be aimed at the growing desktop publishing market and
other uses that require fast transmission of color images. The
transmitted image could be printed out or electronically stored on
the other end.
   The new ``Colorfax'' system, which includes a color scanner,
color printer, data compression device and high-speed modem, can
scan any color document and reproduce it in 256,000 color
combinations, said StarSignal President Robert Widergren.
   After several weeks of testing the device, the company will start
shipping the unit in quantity in March, Widgren said.

   The stock market finished higher today in active
trading, rebounding briskly late in the session.
   Analysts said the market succumbed early today to profit-taking
in the wake of last week's impressive rally, which continued on
Monday.
   ``We're pretty overbought,'' said Edward Nicoski, an analyst at
Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis. ``It just looks like
we're undergoing a bout of profit-taking.''
   Wall Street's bullish enthusiasm was dampened somewhat by
comments today by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan,
analysts said. Among other things, Greenspan told Congress' Joint
Economic Committee that the potential threat of inflation still
persists in the economy.
   The Fed chairman had made similar statements last week, but the
stock and bond markets were unruffled by them at that time.
   After the market tested lower levels, however, it bounced back
late in the day and again showed the strength characterizing its
recent rally. As the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell toward
the 2,300 level, a massive buying surge was said to be triggered.
   ``This is a market that shows resilience,'' said Monte Gordon,
director of research at Dreyfus Corp.
   The comeback reinforced market players' belief that many foreign
investors and U.S. institutions are poised to jump on the rally
bandwagon.
   ``I remain bullish on the market,'' said Peter DaPuzzo, manager
of the retail equity group at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``I think
the ingredients are still there for the market to continue with the
rally.''

<HEAD>Navy Awards $459.4 Million Contract To Texas Instruments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy on Tuesday awarded a $459.4 million
contract to Texas Instruments Inc., combining in one fixed-price
contract its fiscal 1989 order for HARM missiles along with that of
the Air Force and West Germany.
   The service, in a brief announcement, said it was buying 2,449
High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles, or HARM's, from Texas
Instruments this year. That combines an order for 1,319 for itself,
another 950 for the Air Force and 180 for West Germany, the Navy
said.
   The sale to West Germany, worth $35.2 million, is the first-ever
foreign sale of the weapon.
   The HARM missile is an air-to-ground missile used to attack enemy
radars of the sort that guide anti-aircraft guns and surface-to-air
missiles. The HARM guidance system is designed to automatically lock
on the enemy radar's emissions.
   The Navy said Tuesday's contract was awarded to Texas
Instruments' Defense Systems and Electronics Group in Dallas and
would be administered by its Naval Air Systems Command.
   ``Delivery of these missiles will begin in December 1990 and will
continue through November 1991,'' the Navy said.

<HEAD>Office of Fair Trading To Investigate Complaint Against De Beers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was
investigating a complaint alleging anti-competitive practices by a
London-based diamond cartel controlled by South Africa's giant De
Beers diamond organization.
   The watchdog body said De Beers ``appeared to have'' a monopoly
on diamond trading in London and it was interested in establishing
whether there had been an abuse of the monopoly.
   Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, a British mining concern with no
diamond interests, acknowledged that it filed the complaint as a
defensive move against a stalled takeover bid by Luxembourg-based
Minorco SA.
   Minorco is 60.1 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. of South
Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold and
diamond mining interests controlled by the Oppenheimer family of
South Africa.
   The British government is expected to rule in the next few weeks
whether to allow Minorco to proceed with its 2.9 billion-pound
(about $5.1 billion) bid for Consolidated Gold following an
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   A Consolidated Gold spokesman, commenting on condition he was not
identified, said the company wanted to point up the ``monopolistic
tendencies'' of South Africa's Anglo-American group of companies.
   De Beers' Central Selling Organization, which controls 80 percent
of world diamond trading, has been based in London for 60 years.
   As well as selling the stones mined by De Beers and other South
African companies, the organization trades on behalf of diamond
producers including Zaire, Australia, Botswana and the Soviet Union.
   The Office of Fair Trading said it would first have to establish
whether it had jurisdiction over the Central Selling Organization
because although it is based in London, De Beers is a South African
company.
   There is no time limit on the office's investigation. After it is
completed, the Office of Fair Trading may decide to refer the
complaint to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   A spokesman for the Central Selling Organization said the Office
of Fair Trading notified the organization about the inquiry but
hadn't yet requested any information.
   ``It's still early'' in the investigation, said the spokesman,
commenting on condition he was not identified.
   De Beers's shares were unchanged Tuesday on the London Stock
Exchange at $12 (U.S.).

<HEAD>NADA President Issues Challenges to Automakers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automakers are discriminating against the
nation's automobile dealers, who must unite to make buying and
selling cars a fairer game in the United States, the president of a
dealers' group said Tuesday.
   ``We dealers are swivel-necked from turning the other cheek, and
it simply has to stop,'' said Ron Tonkin, the 1989 president of the
National Automobile Dealers Association.
   ``We want automakers to be healthy and profitable, but not by
wreaking havoc on the best, most loyal friends they ever had, their
dealers,'' said Tonkin, a dealer with 10 stores holding 14
automobile franchises in the Portland, Ore., area.
   In his speech to about 20,000 peopel attending NADA's annual
convention, Tonkin singled out the subsidies from automakers to
companies that buy fleets of cars.
   He said he wanted the makers to ``simply tell us `We will sell to
no one for less than we sell to our franchised dealers.'''
   But company officials for the Big Three automakers said their
fleet brokers are franchised dealers.
   C.N. Moore, General Motors Corp.' vice president for customer
sales and service, said from his office in Detroit that all GM's
fleet sales are through franchised dealers, except for sales to the
federal government.
   ``These people that Ron Tonkin was talking to today are the
people who deliver all these cars to fleet customers,'' Moore said.
   Ford Motor Co. spokesman Ray Windecker and Chrysler Corp.
spokesman Tom Houston each said their companies' fleet sales are
arranged through dealers. Chrysler's cars for the federal government
must go through dealers, Houston said.
   Ford sells directly to the federal government and the Red Cross.
   But Tonkin said dealers who handle fleet sales frequently handle
only the paperwork associated with them, not the vehicles themselves.
   ``While technically what they're saying is correct,'' Tonkin
said, ``after you go out beyond the dealer that's doing the
paperwork, there are dealers who are damning it.''
   Automaker officials declined to say how much a subsidy might be
worth to a dealer.
   Around 20 percent of the industry's sales, roughly 1.6 million
cars a year, are to fleet customers, the companies said.
   On other matters, Tonkin:
   _Called on automakers to pay for space in their showrooms like
food and beverage makers pay for shelf space in grocery stores.
   _Said he was forming a task force to meet with manufacturers
hoping to find a way to make customer satisfaction indexes more
uniform. Tonkin said the indexes sometimes discriminate against
dealers and should be standardized for the industry.
   _Simplify warranties to make them more understandable for car
buyers and sellers.

<HEAD>Cold Weather, Coming of Lent Affect Futures Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The onslaught of colder weather and an expected drop in meat
demand during Lent influenced futures prices for some farm
commodities Tuesday, analysts said.
   Grain and soybean prices were up sharply on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Prices were bolstered by unexpectedly high weekly export
inspection figures and a report from Sparks Commodities, a private
crop analyst, that pegged Argentina's soybean crop lower than U.S.
Agriculture Department estimates, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``A weather forecast calling for bitter cold temperatures in
wheat growing areas supported the wheat prices,'' said Mickey Luth,
a Chicago analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Wheat settled 3\ cents to 6} cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in March at $4.40{ a bushel; corn was 3} cents to 7\ cents
higher, with March at $2.74} a bushel; oats were 6 cents to 6} cents
higher, with March at $2.21} a bushel; and soybeans were 4 cents to
12} cents higher, with March at $7.72} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures prices were mostly higher on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cash prices were helpful for both cattle and hog futures, said
Jerry Gidel, general analyst with G.H. Miller, but enthusiasm was
limited by the propect of diminished consumer demand for meat during
Lent, a 40-day religious period which begins Feb. 8.
   ``The cold weather forecast has been a factor in the
marketplace,'' said Gidel in Chicago. ``There should be less farmer
movement of animals to market once the colder temperatures set in.''
   Cattle settled .10 cent to .42 cent higher, with the contract for
delivery in February at 74.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08
cent to .30 cent higher, with March at 84.47 cents a pound; live
hogs were .05 cent to .80 cent higher, with February at 43.35 cents
a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to 1.00 cent
higher, with February at 39.52 cents a pound.
   Precious metal prices were lower for the fourth straight session
on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   ``The further declines were in response to strong dollar gains,
which were accomplished by (Federal Reserve Chairman) Alan
Greenspan's anti-inflationary statements to Congress today,'' said
Jim Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc. in New York.
   Gold settled $3.70 to $4.10 lower, with the contract for delivery
in February at $391.60 a troy ounce; and silver was 4 cents to 4.4
cents lower, with February at $5.79.2 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil settled 16 cents to 26 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in March at $17.03 a barrel; and heating oil was .31
cent to .64 cent lower, with February at 52.28 cents a gallon.

   The dollar surged to three-month highs Tuesday
after Federal Reserve Board Chairman said the U.S. trade deficit
would shrink in coming months without a decline in the dollar's
value.
   Gold prices, meanwhile, fell to their lowest level in two years,
continuing the downward trend that began last Friday when they broke
below $400 an ounce.
   Greenspan also said that the Federal Reserve's efforts to boost
interest rates would not lead to a recession, but would extend the
current expansion by keeping inflation under control.
   Currency dealers took the remarks to mean that the U.S. central
bank was unconcerned by the dollar's recent rise and was willing to
keep interest rates tight, something that would make
dollar-denominated investments attractive.
   ``It was Greenspan today,'' said Kathryn Curtin, assistant
treasurer of the National Australia Bank Ltd. in New York.
   Testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress,
Greenspan also reiterated his statement of last week that the
current rate of inflation is too high and said he expects a further
substantial contraction in the U.S. trade deficit.
   Dealers have been focusing on firm U.S. interest rates this year
rather than the budget and trade deficits that preoccupied them last
year.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.60 yen to a closing 129.13. But later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 129.85 yen. In New York the dollar rose to
130.13 yen from 129.30 on Monday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7535 to buy one pound, cheaper for buyers than $1.7650 late
Monday. In New York the pound fell to $1.7531 from $1.7625.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
levels, included: 1.8767 West German marks, up from 1.8595; 1.5978
Swiss francs, up from 1.5808; 1.1830 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1813; 6.3743 French francs, up from 6.3235; and 1,371.3 Italian
lire, up from 1,360.5.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
levels, included: 1.8710 West German marks, up from 1.8660; 1.5985
Swiss francs, up from 1.5884; 6.3580 French francs, up from 6.3500;
2.1100 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1085; 1,365.00 Italian lire, down
from 1,365.50; and, 1.1840 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1820.
   The price of gold fell sharply in New York after having been
little changed earlier in the Far East and Europe.
   ``The (precious) metals have just done nothing for so long and
they have to test their lows before they can go higher. ... It's a
matter of water seeking its proper level,'' said Alan Posnick,
senior vice president of MTB Banking Corp. in New York.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose 59 cents a troy ounce to close at a bid
$396.55.
   Gold fell slightly in London to a late bid price of $394.25 a
troy ounce, compared with late Monday's $394.50. In Zurich, gold was
slightly higher, closing at a bid $394.20 compared with $394.00 late
Monday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $391.60 a troy ounce from $395.30 on Monday. Later,
Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was bid at
$390.80 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $394.35 late Monday.
   Silver bullion prices rose slightly on the London market where
the metal was trading at a late bid price of $5.85 a troy ounce,
compared with Monday's $5.83. But on New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $5.792 an ounce from $5.832 on
Monday.

   Energy futures prices declined Tuesday due to
weather and other factors as investors awaited new statistics on
domestic petroleum supplies.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell 26 cents
to close at $17.03 after falling 45 cents on Monday.
   Among refined products, the February contract for unleaded
gasoline lost 1.16 cents to settle at 47.72 cents a gallon, while
domestic heating oil slumped 0.31 cent to a settlement price of
52.28 cents a gallon. The prices of other contract months also
declined.
   Traders said the reopening of the Alaska pipeline after a partial
closing on Monday due to sub-freezing temperatures, contributed to
the drop in heating oil prices. Near-month contract prices had
jumped on Monday as investors anticipated a surge in demand due to
the partial shutdown as well as the blast of cold temperatures that
hit the United States.
   Heating oil and gasoline prices also lost ground as investors
adjusted their positions on the last day of the February contract,
analysts said.
   Jim Fiedler, chief energy broker for E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., said the decline in crude prices was due partly to
technical corrections following several weeks of steadily rising
prices since November's agreement by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   The accord, which took effect Jan. 1 and extends for six months,
set an oil production quota of 18.5 million barrels a day for the 13
OPEC members.
   At the time the accord was reached, OPEC was producing more than
22 million barrels, far more than the market could absorb. The
excess forced prices to the $12 range, below the $18 benchmark price
set by OPEC.
   Traders said they also anticipated a buildup in energy stocks
when the American Petroleum Institute released its weekly report
after the close of trading on Tuesday.

   The stock market finished higher Tuesday after
rebounding briskly late in the trading session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 18.21 points to
2,342.32, its highest close since the October 1987 market crash and
its third straight finish over 2,300 since the collapse. The widely
watched blue-chip barometer had lost as much as 15 points earlier in
the day.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2-to-1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
960 up, 541 down and 493 unchanged.
   ``This is a market that shows resilience,'' said Monte Gordon,
director of research at Dreyfus Corp.
   The comeback reinforced market players' belief that many foreign
investors and U.S. institutions have been reassured by a strong
dollar and apparently sound economy _ and are ready to jump on the
Wall Street bandwagon that began rolling last week.
   ``I remain bullish on the market,'' said Peter DaPuzzo, manager
of the retail equity group at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``I think
the ingredients are still there for the market to continue with the
rally.''
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 194.05 million
shares, up from 167.83 million in Monday's session.
   Analysts said the market weakened early Tuesday from
profit-taking in the aftermath of last week's impressive rally,

<HEAD>Xerox Announces Cuts Of 2,000 Jobs; Posts Loss For Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, Xerox stock, to UPDATE with closing price.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp., dissatisfied with its earnings, on
Tuesday announced a $275 million streamlining program under which it
will cut 2,000 jobs, trim its electronic typewriter business and
stop selling medical image-making equipment.
   The Stamford, Conn.-based copier giant said a charge to cover
costs of the program was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1988,
resulting in a $77 million loss for the quarter.
   Without the pre-tax charge of $275 million, profit in the quarter
would have risen 8 percent, Xerox said.
   Xerox stock rose 37{ cents a share to $62.37{ in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Xerox lost money last year in electronic typewriters; document
workstations; and medical image-making, which uses an unusual
copying process called xeroradiography, according to David Kearns,
Xerox's chairman and chief executive.
   ``We are not moving as rapidly toward our objectives as we feel
we must,'' Kearns said in a news conference, explaining the
streamlining program.
   The losses were partially offset by a good reception for its new
50 Series of copiers and healthy profits in the financial services
business, which accounts for 30 percent of Xerox revenue, the
company said.
   Xerox said its loss in the fourth quarter contrasted with a
profit of $155 million, or $1.43 a share, a year earlier. Without
the charge, it said, profit would have been $167 million. Revenue
rose 6 percent to $4.4 billion from $4.15 billion a year earlier.
   For all of 1988, Xerox said its earnings fell 33 percent to $388
million, or $3.50 a share, from $578 million, or $5.35 a share, a
year earlier. Without the fourth-quarter charge, profit would have
risen 9 percent to $632 million. Revenue rose 9 percent to $16.4
billion from $15.1 billion.
   The biggest portion of the fourth-quarter charge, $140 million,
comes from writing off excess manufacturing capacity at its
electronic typewriter plant in Fremont, Calif., and disengaging from
the Xerox Medical Systems business, which is based in Monrovia,
Calif.
   Xerox will continue to provide service and supplies to existing
customers of its medical equipment.
   Another $100 million of the charge comes from the cost of
reducing overhead and employment. Kearns said the company could not
yet say how many of the 2,000 job cuts would have to be achieved by
layoffs, vs. retirements or voluntary resignations.
   The jobs that are being eliminated are in staff rather than in
sales or manufacturing, Kearns said. The cutbacks in Fremont and
Monrovia, Calif., will not involve big job cuts because employment
has already been reduced there, Xerox said.
   The company said the market for cheaper and medium-priced
electronic typewriters has shrunk much faster than expected, leaving
the industry with excess capacity.
   Xerox said it hopes to cure the losses in its document
workstation business by gradually dropping its own workstations and
switching its software over to industry-standard workstations made
by Sun Microsystems Inc.
   Separately, Xerox said it was reorganizing its management. It
said Wayland R. Hicks, an executive vice president, will head a new
marketing and customer organization. William C. Lowe, who was hired
from International Business Machines Corp. in December, will head
development and manufacturing and Jay H. Nussbaum will head a new
unit, Integrated Systems Operations.

<HEAD>Bass Group Discloses 5.6 Percent Stake in Houghton-Mifflin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of Houghton Mifflin Co. stock soared
Tuesday after a group led by wealthy Texan Robert M. Bass disclosed
it recently increased its stake in the publisher to 5.6 percent.
   The Bass Group said in disclosing its holdings that its latest
purchase was for investment purposes, and the company pointed out
that Bass had been an investor in Houghton Mifflin for some time.
   Nonetheless, Wall Streeters remembered that it was the Bass
Group's bid last May that led to the takeover of another publishing
giant, Macmillan Inc., at a price about 80 percent higher than the
company's stock had been trading.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Houghton Mifflin shot up
$8.87{ a share to $45.25. At that price, the company's 14 million
shares are valued at about $633 million.
   The Bass disclosure follows two years of sweeping changes in the
publishing business that has seen Macmillan fall to British
publisher Robert Maxwell, Harper &amp; Row Publishers Inc. yield to
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Grolier Inc. sell to Hachette SA of
France.
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., another publishing giant,
underwent a costly recapitalization in 1987 to avoid being acquired
by Maxwell.
   Alan Kassan, who follows publishing companies for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said Bass demonstrated his interest in the publishing
business with his initial Macmillan bid and his earlier acquisition
of Bell &amp; Howell Co., an information services and publishing concern
based near Chicago.
   ``I don't know what his intentions are, but he has the interest
and the deep pockets to acquire the whole thing if he so chose,''
Kassan said.
   Bert Boksen, who follows media companies for Raymond James &amp;
Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., said Houghton Mifflin could
command a price in the mid-$50 a share range should a buyout effort
be made.
   A woman answering the telephone at Bass's offices in Fort Worth,
Texas, said it was company policy not to comment on its business
plans.
   Boston-based Houghton Mifflin is a leading educational publisher
and also publishes general interest books and educational and
word-processing software.
   It ranked fourth in the nation behind Harcourt, Gulf &amp; Western's
Simon &amp; Schuster and Macmillan based on 1987 educational revenue,
according to the trade newsletter Educational Marketer, published by
Knowledge Industry Publications Inc. in White Plains, N.Y.
   Shearson's Kassan said Houghton Mifflin has been a well-run
company with ``a fair earnings performance'' over the past two years.
   Hougton Mifflin earned $24.1 million, or $1.70 a share, on
revenue of $368.3 million in 1988.
   Nonetheless, Kassan said the company is vulnerable to a takeover
because it has a relatively small amount of its stock in the hands
of company insiders and is ``clearly a leader'' in the elementary
school reading market.
   The elementary school market stands to improve over the next few
years, industry analysts believe, as a growing number of children
reach school age.
   In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Bass Group said it purchased 161,200 shares of Houghton Mifflin
stock between Jan. 10 and Jan. 27 at a prices ranging from $34.21 to
$36.80 a share.
   It said the purchase leaves it with 790,200 common shares of
Houghton Mifflin, or 5.6 percent of its 14 million shares.
   In its statement, Houghton Mifflin said, ``We do not see anything
unusual in the Bass Group's filing. Houghton Mifflin has other large
stockholders, most of whom have been investors for a long time.''
   Paul D. Weaver, secretary for the company, declined comment when
asked if the company's board had met to discuss the matter.
   The company adopted as poison-pill takeover defense plan in
December.
   Last May, the Bass Group prpoosed to acquire Macmillan for $64 a
share at a time when the company's stock had been trading at about
$50 a share. Maxwell acquired Macmillan last fall at a price of
$90.25 a share, or about $2.5 billion.

<HEAD>7-Eleven To Accept Payment Of Utility Bills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Utility customers who don't pay by mail will soon
be able to pay their bills at some 7-Eleven stores.
   National Payments Network of Paramus, N.J., said Southland
Corp.'s 7-Eleven was the first national chain that had agreed to let
the company install computer terminals to handle its electronic
payment system.
   National Payments Network caters mainly to poor and elderly
people who pay their utility bills with cash in person rather than
sending checks by mail, according to Bill Coleman, vice president
for sales and marketing.
   Utility companies in 18 states already accept bills paid through
more than 2,000 locations where the National Payments Network has
outlets. Those are mostly mom 'n' pop stores or small, regional
chains, Coleman said.
   Four 7-Eleven stores in the Los Angeles area have already tested
the National Payments Network system. Other markets will be added as
time goes on, he said.
   Since 7-Eleven stores are franchised, some may choose not to
participate.
   Although many supermarkets and other retail outlets accept
payment of bills, the National Payments Network gets money to
billers faster because it is electronic. That can make a difference
if a utility customer is threatened with cut-off.
   In some areas, 50 to 60 percent of all customers pay their
utility bills in person, National Payments Network said in a news
release.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carlyle Group, a Washington-based investment
partnership, on Tuesday made a new, higher offer for Fairchild
Industries Inc., the Chantilly, Va.-based defense and space
electronics contractor.
   Carlyle made what it called a friendly offer to purchase all
outstanding shares of Fairchild Industries at $16.30 per share, or
more than $230 million assuming 14.4 million shares are outstanding.
   Fairchild's stock fell 25 cents a share to $14.75 in consolidated
New York Stock Exchange trading.
   The new price per share is the same as Fairchild said Monday it
had agreed to pay to acquire the 25 percent stake held by its
largest shareholder group.
   Fairchild, attempting to stave off a takeover threat by the
Carlyle Group, announced Monday that it intended to buy back $75
million worth of stock and securities held by the big shareholder
group, which is headed by George Soros.
   Carlyle countered with its offer Tuesday. It said that if the big
shareholder group was getting $16.30 a share for its block, the rest
of Fairchild shareholders were also entitled to get that much per
share.
   ``We request that you weigh this proposal in light of your
fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders, not management,''
Carlyle said in a statement.
   Fairchild said Monday it planned to sell the common stock it will
acquire from the Soros group to its employee stock ownership plan.
Fairchild said that step could make an acquisition that is not
approved by the board of directors more difficult.
   A partnership controlled by the Carlyle Group owns 9.99 percent
of Fairchild common shares. Its original offer was $15.50 a share,
which amounted to a little more than $220 million for the common
stock. The total acquisition cost to Carlyle under the original and
new offers would be higher because of the cost of acquiring other
securities or taking on Fairchild debt.

<HEAD>Ex-Rookie Analyst To Pay $127,000 In Insider Trading Scam; Friend
Accused</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former junior securities analyst convicted of
inside trading in a major fraud scandal will pay back more than
$127,000 in illegal profits under an agreement approved Tuesday by a
federal judge.
   In addition, a college friend of the 24-year-old trader, Stephen
Wang, was accused in U.S. District Court in Manhattan of making
$30,000 in profits from illegal information supplied by Wang in a
separate scheme.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Owen approved a final settlement in
which Wang, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, agreed to pay
$127,585 to satisfy claims arising from his role in what the
government has called one of the biggest inside trading frauds in
history.
   Under the settlement between Wang and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, a court-appointed receiver will oversee and distribute
the money to cover claims by investors who said they lost money
because of Wang.
   The SEC also filed a complaint charging that Jerome B. Cronin,
also 24, of Chicago, allegedly traded in stocks of at least six
companies using tips provided by Wang, who was sentenced last
October to three years in jail.
   In a settlement with the SEC also approved Tuesday, Cronin agreed
to pay back $20,000 in illegal profits. He did not admit or deny
guilt.
   The SEC's civil complaint alleges that Cronin violated anti-fraud
provisions and received non-public information from Wang about
upcoming tender offers and other pending corporate action.
   The alleged illegal transactions occurred via telephone between
Wang in New York and Cronin in Chicago, who knew each other as
undergraduates at the University of Illinois, from July 1986 through
at least September 1987, according to the complaint.
   ``We're saying (Cronin) knew this was inside information,'' SEC
spokesman Chiles Larson said.
   Wang, then a junior analyst with the prestigious investment firm
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., pleaded guilty to conspiring with Taiwanese
businessman Fred C. Lee to profit in the stock market on secrets
about pending corporate takeovers. The SEC said Lee made about $19
million in illicit profits and paid Wang $200,000.
   At the time, Wang also pleaded guilty to a separate, smaller
insider trading scheme with an another party, now identified as
Cronin.
   The SEC complaint states that Cronin made at least $30,000 from
the information and paid Wang $4,000.
   Cronin allegedly traded in the securities of at least six
publicly held companies: Lehigh Press Inc., Utah Power &amp; Light Co.,
Rexnord Inc., Colt Industries Inc., Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.,
and Burlington Industries Inc.
   The charges against Wang were first disclosed last June.
   At the time, the amount of allegedly illicit profits and the
government's requested penalties, totaling $76 million, made it the
second-largest securities fraud case behind the $100 million in
illicit profits and penalties surrendered by jailed speculator Ivan
Boesky in 1986.
   The Wang case was considered important because much of the
activity came during the height of publicity surrounding Boesky.
   In December, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. agreed to plead guilty
to six felonies and pay a record $650 million in fines in the
largest securities fraud case on record.

   BP America Inc. said Tuesday it is changing the
name of its 7,400 U.S. service stations to ``BP'' by 1991 to better
reflect its status as the largest producer of U.S. crude oil.
   The U.S. subsidiary of the London-based British Petroleum PLC now
operates retail stations in 26 states under Sohio, Boron, Gulf and
BP logos.
   ``I think BP is in many ways the invisible giant of corporate
America,'' said James H. Ross, BP America president and chief
executive officer.
   ``We are the major player in U.S. upstream oil, one of the most
successful and innovative oil companies here and indeed worldwide.
We are far bigger than houshold names in Ohio like TRW, Goodrich and
Sherwin-Williams,'' he said.
   ``Upstream'' refers to the exploration and production side of the
oil business, in contrast with ``downstream'' operations, which
refer to refining and marketing.
   Ross said BP America also has changed the names of its U.S.
exploration, refining and marketing and chemicals businesses to
reflect the BP label.
   BP America operates about 750 service stations in the Northeast
which are identified by the BP logo, with its green shield and two
bright yellow letters. In addition, it has 1,100 Sohio stations in
Ohio, 600 Boron stations in Michigan and western Pennsylvania, and
5,000 Gulf stations in the Southeast. BP America acquired the Gulf
stations from Chevron Corp. in 1985 after Chevron purchased Gulf
Corp. and sold assets to avoid antitrust problems. It also recently
acquired Mobil stations in three West Coast states that will convert
to the BP brand.
   BP America said it plans to redesign some of the service stations
according to a new format.
   Ross said the company ``conducted extensive research, both
nationally and internationally,'' before deciding to unify its
businesses under one name.
   He said use of the name ``BP'' in the United States would provide
the company with a ``consistent identity.''
   BP America, based in Cleveland, moved its headquarters from New
York after the company purchased controlling interest in
Cleveland-based Standard Oil in 1987.

<HEAD>Tribune Co. Reports 67 Percent Jump In 4th Quarter Net Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tribune Co. reported Tuesday its fourth-quarter
profit increased 46 percent, sparked by improved newspaper and
newsprint results and a lower income tax rate.
   Net income for the last three months of 1988 amounted to $62.9
million, or 84 cents a share, compared to $43.2 million, or 56 cents
a share, for the fourth quarter a year earlier, the company, which
publishes the Chicago Tribune, said in a statement.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 8 percent to $625 million from $581
million in 1987.
   For the full year, net income rose 49 percent to $210.4 million,
or $2.78 a share, up from $141.5 million, or $1.80 a share, for 1987.
   Full-year revenue rose 9 percent to $2.33 billion from $2.15
billion a year earlier.
   The 1987 results included pre-tax charges of $21.7 million for
the fourth quarter and $40.1 million for the year relating to
employee severance charges at the New York Daily News, the Tribune
said. Excluding those charges, net income per share increased 18
percent for the fourth quarter and 34 per cent for the year.
   The 1988 improvement reflected record operating profits and a
reduction in the effective tax rate, the company said.
   Operating profit for the company's newspaper business rose 58
percent to $92.4 million as revenue rose 6 percent to $422 million
in the fourth quarter. For the year, the newspaper oprating profit
was $263.7 million, up 37 percent, while revenue rose 7 percent to
$1.6 billion.
   Weakness in the national spot advertising market led to a 3
percent decline in television revenue for its broadcasting and
entertainment group, which operates WGN-TV in Chicago, the company
said. The group's operating profit for the fourth quarter was $16
million, down 4 percent from 1987, as revenue fell 1 percent to $126
million.
   For the year, the broadcasting and entertainment group's
operating profit rose 24 percent to $77.8 million as revenue rose 4
percent to $506 million.

<TEXT>
   Texas Eastern Corp. urged its stockholders in
full-page advertisements in major newspapers Tuesday not to sell
their shares to Coastal Corp., which has mounted a $2.6 billion
takeover bid.
   In addition, several companies that may be interested in making a
competing offer for Texas Eastern have been reviewing the natural
gas company's data.
   Texas Eastern's board of directors on Sunday rejected Coastal's
$42-a-share bid.
   ``Coastal's offer of $42 per share is inadequate. Therefore: Do
not be stampeded into any hasty decision,'' the ads in the Houston
Chronicle, The Houston Post and the Wall Street Journal state.
   Texas Eastern spokesman Fred Wichlep declined to comment on the
number of firms that have reviewed the Texas Eastern data.
   ``All I can tell you is that the data rooms were open on
Saturday, Sunday and Monday, and we have had people in them every
day,'' Wichlep said Monday.
   Texas Eastern, a Houston-based natural gas transmission company,
said last week it planned to contact about 50 companies it believed
may be interested in making a competing offer to the bid by
Houston-based Coastal.
   Wichlep said no special efforts are being used to screen
potential competing bidders. Each company, however, is required to
sign a confidentiality agreement.
   Industry sources have identified British Gas, Elf Aquitaine and
Houston-based Enron Corp., which operates the nation's largest
natural gas transmission system, as three companies that have made
trips to the Texas Eastern data rooms.
   Texas Eastern closed at $48.25, up 25 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange trading Tuesday.
   Before Coastal disclosed its tender offer, Texas Eastern stock
was trading for about $30 a share.
   Coastal President James R. Paul has described Texas Eastern's
search for a competing bidder as an effort to stall Coastal's offer
and a waste of stockholders' money. Coastal's offer is to expire
Feb. 13.

<HEAD>Du Pont Gets Patent for CFC Replacements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co. has received a patent on a
compound blend that could accelerate the replacement of halogenated
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which damage the earth's ozone layer,
a spokesman said Tuesday.
   The company said the three-component blends of environmentally
acceptable compounds will have no adverse effects on the
environment, compared to CFC-12, one of the products suspected of
depleting the ozone layer.
   Du Pont is the largest maker of CFCs in the world and has said it
will cease making the chemicals by the end of the century.
   Scientists say CFCs have the potential to damage the environment,
including decreasing the ozone layer, a shield that protects the
earth from ultraviolet light.
   Under the Montreal Protocol treaty, countries producing CFCs have
agreed to reduce CFC production by 50 percent by 1998. The United
States has signed the agreement.
   The new blends could be used for existing medium-temperature food
display cases, vending machines, water coolers, home refrigerators
and freezers, and automobile air conditioners _ all of which make up
about 30 percent of the CFC market in the United States.
   The new blends would gradually be placed in items that use CFCs
as they wear out. ``Otherwise we would not be able to phase out
production (of CFCs) until all the equipment was off the market,''
said Tony McCain, Du Pont manager of the alternative development
program.
   ``We will still work to find an alternative for new equipment.
This would go in parallel with it,'' he said.
   ``We have received a patent on the technology which says the
blend works. But it will take a couple of years to test it in
operating systems to define all the changes that might be required
in a refrigerator or car and then we have to finish the process
development,'' McCain said.
   The new technology was made public Monday at a meeting of the
American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning
Engineers in Chicago.
   Candidate components for the blends include HCFC-22, HFC-152a and
HCFC-124.
   McCain said HCFC-124 is a new product.
   ``Mix those three together and you get something very close to
what we had with CFC-12 as far as performance,'' he said.
   McCain said the blends were more energy efficient than HFC-134a,
the leading single-product candidate alternative for CFCs.
   Du Pont plans to introduce a series of alternative products in a
three- to five-year period beginning in 1990. Complete phaseout of
CFCs may take until the turn of the century, the company said.

   Car dealers from both sides of the world have
some straightforward advice for their U.S. friends _ learn how to
sell used cars.
   More than 100 auto dealers and manufacturers representatives from
16 foreign countries were among thousands of U.S. automobile dealers
who attended the 72nd annual convention of the National Automobile
Dealers Association, which ended Tuesday.
   Visiting dealers from Australia and England, with almost the same
words, said they were struck by how little attention U.S. dealers
paid to selling cars that have some miles on them.
   ``You have no idea how to sell a used car,'' said Bruce White, a
Nissan dealer from Melbourne, Australia. ``I think we can teach the
Americans how to sell them.''
   ``I think we can sell a used car better than you can,'' said
Ashley Winter, a Ford dealer from Newcastle, England.
   In separate interviews, White and Winter said used-car sales make
up half or more of their dealership volumes, and speculated that the
difference may be because U.S. drivers don't treat their cars as
well.
   NADA figures show that used-car sales accounted for 6.3 percent
of all vehicle sales in the United States in 1987, the latest year
for which figures are available.
   Two U.S. auto dealers said the proliferation of used-car auction
houses and used-car businesses not affiliated with a franchised
operation is probably the reason.
   John Bayer of Dudley, Mass., who sells Pontiac, Cadillac and
Oldsmobile cars, said there was discussion at the NADA convention
about preparing a car for resale.
   Bayer and Steve Grindstaff, owner of Grindstaff Chevrolet in
Elizabethton, Tenn., said in interviews that the condition of a
trade-in is a major consideration of whether the car is kept on the
dealer's used-car lot or sold elsewhere.
   Prices also are a big difference in cars sold in the United
States and overseas, the dealers said. Governmental regulations and
duties jack up the prices of cars in Australia sometimes by 100
percent, White said.
   He added the regulations also make some vehicles too expensive
for him and his fellow dealers to handle.
   ``We'd love to have these vans,'' White said after seeing some of
the customized van conversion displays on the NADA show floor. ``But
you can't get them in.''

   Maytag Corp. said Tuesday it will sell the
five furniture companies it obtained last week in its acquisition of
Chicago Pacific Corp.
   ``The furniture companies are all quality firms with
well-established brand names, but they don't fit in with our
long-range plans,'' Maytag president Daniel Krumm said.
   ``Selling them will strengthen our balance sheet,'' he said.
   For sale are Brown Jordan of El Monte, Calif.; Gunlocke of
Wayland, N.Y.; Kittinger of Buffalo, N.Y.; McGuire of San Francisco;
and Pennsylvania House of Lewisburg, Pa.
   Krumm said the companies had combined estimated sales last year
of $254 million. He said the companies will be sold as a group.
   Also for sale is Charter Group of Martinsville, Va., which
handles contract sales to the hospitality industry.
   Maytag purchased Chicago Pacific for $1 billion, primarily to
obtain its Hoover division, best known for Hoover vacuum cleaners.
Hoover's foothold in European markets also gives Maytag a chance to
expand European sales of its major appliances, which include the
brand names Admiral, Hardwick, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, Maytag and
Norge.

<HEAD>Contracting For New Construction Rebounds 8 Percent In December</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracting for new construction rebounded 8
percent in December, marking a departure from the general
sluggishness of 1988, according to a report Tuesday.
   ``Despite its strong finish, 1988 was a year of generally
softening construction activity, as the value of all newly started
work fell 2 percent short of the 1987 peak,'' George A. Christie,
vice president and chief economist of F.W. Dodge Group, said in a
statement.
   Christie said the 1988 decline ended a five-year period of
continuously expanding construction contracting. He predicted the
market would decline again this year.
   The big factors in the drop were overbuilt commercial properties
and limited public funding, according to F.W. Dodge, a unit of
McGraw-Hill Inc. An additional factor this year is higher interest
rates, Christie said.
   Construction of highways and other public works projects
contributed to an 18 percent increase in the non-building category
in December over November. For the year, the category fell 1 percent
from 1987.
   Residential building rose 7 percent in December but was about
even for the year.
   Contracting for non-residential buildings rose 4 percent in
December but was down 5 percent for the year.
   By region, contracting fell 4 percent in the Northeast, held even
in the North Central region, fell 4 percent in the South and rose 2
percent in the West, F.W. Dodge said.

<HEAD>Robert Bass Busiest Of Wealthy Brothers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Houghton Mifflin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The billionaire Bass brothers are often
described as classic passive investors, but their business ventures
have kept them among the nation's 400 richest people.
   The Bass dynasty traces its roots to the forays of wildcatter Sid
Richardson, who made a series of successful oil strikes in West
Texas. Upon his death in 1959, he willed most of his money to his
partner and nephew, Perry Bass.
   After vastly expanding Richardson's holdings, Perry retired in
the late 1960s and left the family empire to his four sons, who each
inherited $2.8 million. They combined assets to form Bass Brothers
Enterprises, which was managed by eldest son, Sid Bass.
   With bold moves from the oil patch into stocks and real estate,
the brothers added to their collective and individual fortunes.
   Among their most lucrative ventures, the Basses netted an $850
million capital gain after helping to thwart a 1985 takeover fight
for Walt Disney Co. Also that year, the family liquidated Bass
Brothers Enterprises, its primary investment vehicle, and divided
the assets four ways, freeing the brothers to cut some individual
deals.
   Since then, Robert Bass has focused much of his energy on the
information sector. In 1985, he led a group that made a $205 million
investment in Cincinnati-based Taft Broadcasting Co. that was worth
$718 million two years later. He and two other shareholders divided
Taft's assets, with the Bass group getting $157.5 million in cash, a
television station in Columbus, Ohio, and two large cable television
properties.
   In 1988, Robert Bass was instrumental in prying away the Westin
hotel chain from Allegis Corp. for $1.53 billion. In March, he sold
the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan to fellow billionaire Donald J. Trump
for $410 million.
   Last May 17, he reached an agreement to purchase Bell &amp; Howell
Co., a publishing information services company in Skokie, Ill.
   On the same day, a group that he led proposed to buy Macmillan
Inc. The move put the publishing giant in play and it was acquired
last fall by British publisher Robert Maxwell for $2.5 billion and
gave the Bass Group a gain of about $75 million on its holdings
before expenses.
   Most recently, the Bass Group put up $350 million for the bailout
of insolvent American Savings and Loan Association of California, a
subsidiary of Financial Corp. of America.
   The brothers zealously guard their privacy, persistently refusing
interviews and shunning transactions that would require much
financial disclosure.
   They have been described as atypical Texas tycoons with their
conservative style and reserved manner. In Fort Worth, they are
universally revered for their civic investments.
   Sid is director of the generous Sid Richardson Foundation. Ed
often described as the family maverick, has been more interested in
arts and environmental projects. Lee is working with Sid, while
Robert has taken an interest in some political projects.
   ``The big difference in the Basses _ and most people like the
Basses _ is that they're really not looking for any credit for what
they do. They do it because they think it's what they should do and
what's good,'' said Dee Kelly, a Fort Worth lawyer and longtime
family friend.
   Despite their financial muscle, the Basses aren't the
strong-arming type, preferring to work with the management of target
companies, as they did in the Disney situation, Checchi noted.

<HEAD>Foreign Investment in U.S. Setting New Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign investment in the United States, which
soared to a record of $58.1 billion reported in 1987, is set to go
even higher for 1988 according to Richard Apcar, director of
investment analysis at the Commerce Department.
   ``How much the increase will be depends on the data we're still
collecting for the last few months of the year,'' he said in an
interview Tuesday.
   ``It was about $30 billion for the first half of 1988, and I'd
guess about $20 billion for the first half of 1987.''
   Actual investment figures are much larger. For more than half the
deals reported the department could not find any figure at all.
   The biggest takeover in 1988 was the acquisition of Federated
Department Stores, the fifth largest U.S. retailer, by Campeau Corp.
of Toronto, Canada. That was about $6.6 billion.
   In 1987 British Petroleum Co. spent nearly $8 billion for the 45
percent of Standard Oil Co. that it did not already own. That put
the total of British acquisitions for the year at $21.2 billion.
Figures were identified for only 117 of the 249 transactiona.
   As has been the case for the past three years, Japan was the most
active investor with 490 separate deals. Of these, 235 carried
idenifiable prices totalling 13 billion.
   ``While Japan will continue to be the source for most Asian
investments for the foreseeable future, it is interesting to note
that other Asian-Pacific investors, especially from Australia and
New Zealand, have increased their activity here -- the number of
transactions doubled and the value quadrupled in 1987,'' said the
Commerce Department's report.
   It was issued last Friday.
   ``Foreign investment makes an important contribution to the U.S.
economy,'' Michael Boskin, named by President George Bush as his top
economic adviser, said last week.
   ``By helping to build productive plant and equipment in the
United States, foreign investment contributes to current and future
increases in jobs, productivity and growth...
   ``Concerns about foreign ownership are somewhat exaggerated. By
the end of 1987, measured net foreign assets in the United States
amounted to some 3.1 percent of U.S. netwealth on an historical cost
basis.''
   The Commerce Department's report said the trend toward the growth
of foreign investment began in 1983, with the recovery from the
recession of the previous two years. The total number of deals had
peaked at about 1,200 in 1981 and then dropped sharply. In 1987 the
total was 1,328, with values reported for 588 of them. That was an
increase of 26 percent over the year before.
   The report attributed the big rise since 1983 to:
   _The drop in the international price of the dollar after 1985,
which made it cheaper for foreigners to buy in this country
   _Eagerness by many American firms to become more profitable and
avoid takeovers by getting rid of divisions and subsidiaries they no
longer wanted
   _Tthe belief by foreign investors that they must invest in the
world's largest consumer market in order to stay competiive in the
world.
   Boskin said that although the United States has become a debtor
country -- with larger assets owned here by foreigners than
Americans own in other countries -- U.S. direct investment in actual
property and equipment remains greater than foreign direct
investment in the United States. The figures are reversed when
indirect investments such as stocks and bonds are tasken into
account.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. and lawyers representing
thousands of black employees in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana announced
Tuesday they had tentatively settled a bias suit against the
automaker that could give the plaintiffs payments totaling $3
million.
   The two sides agreed upon a proposed consent decree to end the
case, but GM did not admit it had discriminated against blacks in
promotions and pay raises, company spokeswoman Patricia J. Molloy
said.
   The proposal provides for distribution of $1.6 million to about
2,800 former GM employees, and raises averaging $1,000 a year for
about 1,000 current employees, plaintiffs' attorney Dennis D. James
said.
   James told a news conference the proposed decree also requires
five years of monitoring to ensure that black salaried employees get
their fair share of promotions and pay increases.
   Sheldon Miller, another attorney for the plaintiffs, said the
tentative agreement ``reaffirms the importance of class-action civil
rights litigation, especially in the current unfriendly political
climate towards civil rights in general.''
   The suit, filed in 1983 by four employees, was a class action on
behalf of 10,000 salaried black employees who worked for GM between
1982 and 1986 in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio.
   Those states were chosen for the suit because GM employees there
made a manageable-sized group for the legal action, and because GM
plants and offices in those states account for 75 percent of the
company's salaried employees, James said.
   Members of the class will be notified of the proposed agreement
over the next two weeks and be given a chance to lodge any
objections they may have. U.S. District Judge John Feikens then will
schedule a hearing on whether the decree should be approved, James
said.
   The decree was submitted to Feikens about two weeks ago and
Feikens gave his preliminary approval Tuesday, James said.
   ``This will help blacks to achieve a more equitable position in
upper management and also middle management,'' said the Rev. James
Kennedy, one of the four original plaintiffs.
   Kennedy, now pastor of Mount Carmel Baptist Church in Flint, was
employed at GM's AC sparkplug subsidiary in Flint.
   He told the news conference that after starting in 1956, he
worked his way up from janitor to supervisor of warehousing and
shipping at the AC plant, but found that whites had better paychecks
and higher job expectations.
   Also present were two other original plaintiffs, Larry Dodson,
sales engineer at GM's Allison Transmission subsidiary in
Indianapolis, and Larry Kitchen, an employee of GM's
Chevrolet-Pontiac-GM of Canada group in Detroit, who both reported
similar experiences.
   The fourth plaintiff, Dennis Huguley, formerly on GM's design
staff in Warren, Mich., left GM for a job with Mercedes Benz of
North America in Charlotte, N.C., James said.

   Federal aviation officials ordered airlines
Tuesday to inspect all of four types of Boeing airliners built in
the last eight years after wiring mix-ups were found on four more
planes.
   In its most far-reaching order to date on the possibility of
cross-wiring and cross-plumbing in airline safety systems, the
Federal Aviation Administration gave airlines 25 days to complete
the testing of both engine and cargo hold safety systems in 741
aircraft.
   ``This will easily affect most airlines,'' said FAA spokesman
Fred Farrar. The inspections were ordered for 472 Boeing 737s, 33
Jumbo 747s, 123 757s and 113 767s manufactured after Dec. 31, 1980.
   Previous FAA orders prompted by the discovery of fouled-up wiring
or plumbing in several Boeing aircraft throughout the world were
limited only to plumbing and wiring on individual types of airliners.
   Wiring and plumbing problems became the subject of FAA orders
after British authorities speculated the pilot of a British Midland
Airways 737 was deceived into shutting down his only good engine in
a crash that killed 44 people in England Jan. 8.
   Authorities have not concluded what caused both engines to be
shut down in the British plane, but since the crash, cross-wiring of
engine or cargo hold fire warning systems has been found in other
planes.
   Inspections ordered earlier by British authorities covered Airbus
A320s as well as Boeing 737s, but faulty wiring has been found only
in Boeing aircraft, all of which are built in Seattle.
   Boeing spokesman David Jiminez said the aircraft builder had no
immediate comment on the latest order. Officials of Boeing and
several airlines had said they agreed with previous orders as
prudent measures to ensure safety.
   The newly ordered tests are not expected to disrupt airline
schedules and can be completed anytime over the next 3{ weeks while
the airliners are undergoing routine maintenance.
   Under the ``airworthiness directive'' issued by the FAA's Seattle
office, airlines are ordered to repair and report any defects to the
FAA.
   Farrar said the four additional problems were found either during
work done under previous directives or in independent testing by
airlines.
   They included faulty wiring on three 757s, he said, including one
case of an incomplete circuit that would have kept a fire
extinguisher from operating and two cases of cross-wiring. One would
have indicated the wrong engine was overheating and the other would
have set off the fire extinguisher to the wrong engine, Farrar said.
   The fourth case involved cross-wiring that would have indicated
fire in the wrong engine of a 737, he said.
   Farrar said that while foreign airlines flying Boeing aircraft
are not required to follow the directives, most of them will conduct
the tests.

<HEAD>2nd GAF Trial Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The second trial of GAF Corp. on stock
manipulation charges opened in federal court in Manhattan Tuesday.
   ``This is a case about cheating in the stock market,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney Carl Lowenson Jr. told the jury picked for the second
trial.
   GAF, a major manufacturer of specialty chemicals and building
materials, and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, were indicted
last July for allegedly manipulating the stock of Union Carbide
Corp. in 1986. They were accused of improperly trying to inflate the
price of Union Carbide stock to enhance the value of GAF's holdings
in the corporation.
   GAF attorney Arthur Liman countered Tuesday that a government
probe had uncovered ``no smoking gun'' to link the defendants to the
stock manipulations of Boyd Jefferies, onetime head of a Los
Angeles-based trading firm.
   Jefferies, who struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after being
implicated in the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal, testified for
the government at the first trial, which began in December.
   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe declared a mistrial in that
proceeding Jan. 10 because of an error by Lowenson, who failed to
reveal a report that concluded a key piece of evidence had been
altered.
   The second trial was convened after U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall refused to continue a delay requested by the
defense, which claimed a second trial would violate the defendants'
right to avoid double jeopardy.

<HEAD>Centaur Demands Special Meeting Of Pennwalt Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centaur Partners, stymied in its $765 million
effort to buy Pennwalt Corp., said Tuesday that holders of more than
34 percent of Pennwalt's stock have called for a shareholders
meeting, at which Centaur hoped to replace the chemical company's
board.
   Centaur said it had delivered to Pennwalt proxies from
shareholders owning approximately 34.6 percent of Pennwalt's
outstanding stock. Under Pennsylvania law, a special meeting must be
called if one is requested by the holders of at least 20 percent of
a company's outstanding voting stock.
   State law requires the company to call the meeting within two
months of the request, Centaur said.
   Pennwalt officials said they were ``in the process of reviewing
the demands to determine whether they have been submitted by the
requisite shareholders and whether they are in a form that would be
effective.''
   At the meeting, Centaur said, Pennwalt shareholders would be
asked to remove the directors, reduce the board from 11 to five
members and eliminate the requirement that directors also be
shareholders.
   In addition, the shareholders would be asked to elect five new
directors proposed by Centaur.
   Candidates nominated by Centaur would likely be more sympathetic
to the partnership's offer.
   Centaur, whoise principals are New York financiers Abbey J.
Butler and Melvyn J. Estrin, launched a $100-a-share bid in
mid-December for the 6.98 million shares of common stock it did not
own. At the time, the group owned about 12.7 percent of Pennwalt's
shares.
   In an effort to thwart the bid, Pennwalt spent $403.8 million to
buy 4.75 million shares, or about 40 percent of those outstanding.
   Pennwalt stock closed Tuesday at $106 a share, up 25 cents in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Pennwalt is fighting the Centaur bid in court, claiming
disclosures made by the group in its tender offer and the
solicitation of proxies from Pennwalt's shareholders were false and
misleading.

   Genentech Inc. has decided not
to appeal a British ruling that denied the company exclusive
marketing rights in England to a drug used to fight heart attacks.
   The company said Tuesday ``the doctrines applied in the British
case will have no relevance in U.S. patent cases.''
   Genentech had fought in the British courts against Wellcome PLC
over the British patent for recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator, or TPA. The drug, marketed by Genentech in North America
under the name Activase, is used to dissolve blod clots that cause
heart attacks.
   England's High Court ruled in July against Genentech's unusual
claim to have patented the drug itself.
   In the past, companies have generally been allowed to patent only
the lab process for making genetically-engineered drugs, because the
drugs themselves are found in nature.
   Genentech originally said it would appeal the British ruling.
   TPA has yet to be approved by the federal Food and Drug
Administration for sale in the United States.

   Holiday Corp. has sold five Holiday Inn

   The hotels were sold to a limited partnership, Holiday Pacific

concentrating on property management.
   The company announced plans in 1987 to sell off assets to
generate $900 million in after-tax proceeds as part of an overall

<HEAD>Justice Dept. Says Company Agrees to Settle Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California computer company has agreed to pay
$7.4 million to settle claims that one of its subsidiaries
improperly charged the Pentagon on contracts, the Justice Department
said Tuesday.
   The department said it had reached the agreement with Computer
and Communications Technology Corp. of San Diego and the subsidiary,
Zeta Laboratories Inc., of San Jose, to settle a government claim
that the Defense Department was defrauded on contract charges
between 1983 and 1986.
   The alleged improprieties were discovered in June 1986 when
Whittaker Corp. acquired Zeta from CCT, the department said.
Whittaker canceled the deal to acquire Zeta, which manufactures
microwave components and subassemblies for weapons systems.
   Last October, Raymond Y.C. Ho, the former president of Zeta, and
William E. Fogarty, the company's former chief financial officer,
pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with the case.
   Both men were fined and ordered to perform 1,000 hours of
community service.
   The companies agreed to pay $1 million plus interest in four
installments and remit the balance after CCT sells the Zeta
subsidiary, the department said. The company could owe a total of
$750,000 worth of interest depending upon when the final payment is
made, the department said.

   The U.S. dollar maintained its strength against the
Japanese yen Wednesday while share prices plunged, discouraged by
the yen's weakness, dealers said.
   The dollar, which opened at 130.58 yen, up a strong 1.45 yen from
Tuesday's 129.13-yen finish, moved mainly between 130.30-.67 during
the early session. It was changing hands at a slightly lower 130.32
yen shortly after midmorning.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 13.80-point loser Tuesday, shed another 102.44
points, or 0.32 percent, to end the morning session at 31,478.86.
   Currency dealers said the strong dollar opening in Tokyo followed
an overnight surge in New York which was prompted by comments from
U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan who said current
exchange rates were tolerable.
   Testifying before a joint economic committee of Congress,
Greenspan said U.S. industry is competitive enough at the present
dollar rate. He added that the current rate of inflation is too high
and he expects a substantial cut in the U.S. trade deficit.
   Dealers said the absence of central bank intervention also fueled
the dollar's jump.
   On the stock exchange, the market's main economic barometer fell
as investors, discouraged by the dollar's rally, started selling
issues, said an analyst with Nomura Securities, Japan's largest
brokerage firm.
   Some participants remained on the sidelines, he added, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   ``There is no sign of the yen's recovery at the moment, but I
believe investors' purchasing power is still strong,'' the analyst
said.

<HEAD>Archer Daniels Midland Seeks 1 Million New Illinois Central Railroad
Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archer Daniels Midland Co. has told federal
officials it wants to increase its stake in Illinois Central
Transportation Co., the target of a $440 million takeover bid,
authorities said.
   Archer Daniels, the Decatur, Ill.-based grain processor, already
owns about 2 million shares of Illinois Central and is seeking
approval to buy another 1 million shares, officials said Monday.
   On Friday, Prospect Group, which operates in the railroad,
insurance, and consumer products and services businesses, began a
$440 million tender offer for Illinois Central Transportation Co.,
less than a month after the railroad was spun off by Whitman Corp.
   Analysts generally believe Archer Daniels is trying to protect
its own interests through the stock purchases. Archer Daniels's
holdings already amount to 9.8 percent of the railroad, but the
grain processor also is one of Illinois Central's largest shippers.
   Archer Daniels said in a filing Monday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission it has notified the Federal Trade Commission of
its desire to increase its holding of common stock in Illinois
Central to no more than 25 percent.
   Archer Daniels has until Feb. 27 to buy the shares, provided the
government approves the purchase.
   The drought last summer made Archer Daniels more dependent than
usual on Illinois Central's freight lines because barge traffic was
slowed or blocked by low river water levels.

<DATELINE>MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allied-Signal Inc. said Tuesday its
fourth-quarter earnings dropped 24 percent from a year earlier, when
income was boosted by a one-time tax benefit.
   Allied-Signal said it earned $104 million, or 70 cents per share,
in the last quarter of 1988, down from $136 million, or 88 cents per
share, in the same period of 1987.
   In the year-earlier period, Allied had a gain of $59 million due
to a one-time tax benefit.
   Sales for the fourth quarter rose to nearly $3.01 billion from
$2.95 billion in the final quarter of 1987.
   For all of 1988, the company reported net income of $463 million,
or $3.10 per share. In 1987, the company had net income of $656
million, or $3.90 per share.
   Sales for 1988 totaled $11.91 billion, up from $11.12 billion.
   The 1987 earnings included net gains of $125 million from the
company's sales of its interest in Henley Group and the issuance of
common stock by its former Union Texas Petroleum subsidiary.
   ``Our core businesses remain strong,'' said Edward L. Hennessy,
chairman and chief executive officer of Allied-Signal.
   Allied-Signal is involved in the aerospace, automotive products
and engineered materials industries.

   Banks and savings institutions were braced
Tuesday for a possible proposal from the Bush administration to
raise their insurance premiums as a way to rescue the government
fund that insures savings and loan associations.
   A White House official said Tuesday night the prevailing thought
in the administration is that such an approach ``is one of the more
attractive'' solutions.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity said that
increased risk for the insurer should translate into higher premiums
for the institutions.
   White House officials were convened in a meeting late Tuesday by
chief of staff John Sununu in a meeting that focused on what
recommendations to make to Bush on the S&amp;L situation.
   `Things are a little scary to us,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther,
executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of
America.
   Guenther said he interpreted comments over the weekend by Sununu
as indicating the administration was backing away from its
controversial suggestion that depositors pay a fee of about 25 cents
on every $100 in their accounts.
   Meanwhile, several members of the Senate Banking Committee called
for a quick infusion of $2 billion into the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp. so that regulators could liquidate more insolvent
S&amp;Ls while Congress debates proposed reforms.
   Sununu, responding to questions in a Sunday television interview,
had defended the deposit fee idea as if he were talking about an
increase in the premium that institutions have been paying since
1934.
   He ``seemed to be moving away from a deposit fee to an increase
in banks' premiums,'' Guenther said in an interview.
   Senior administration officials are saying they will urge
President Bush to propose a premium hike rather than a fee aid by
depositors, according to Tuesday's editions of The New York Times,
which cited unidentified sources, and NBC News.
   Bush intends to present at least an outline of his S&amp;L plan when
he addresses Congress on Feb. 9. So far he has indicated no
preference among the many options.
   ``If I were to make a prediction, my guess is those premiums are
going up,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``Somebody's going to end
up having to pay them. My guess is it will probably be the
institutions, but the depositors will pay them indirectly.
   ``We'll bury this (deposit fee) proposal on the one hand and dig
it up through another hole,'' he said.
   The administration has told members of Congress it likely will
propose selling bonds for about $45 billion. The difficulty comes in
raising the $7 billion to $9 billion needed each year to pay off the
bonds.
   The S&amp;L industry and many members of Congress advocate using tax
money, an alternative the Bush administration is trying to avoid.
   Guenther said an increase in premiums for both banks and S&amp;Ls
would be unfair because about two-thirds of the money generated for
S&amp;Ls would come from banks.
   He estimated that a 25-cent increase in banks' 8.3-cent premium
would push as many as 750 profitable banks into the red. To the
extent that banks and S&amp;Ls pass on the cost to their customers
through lower interest rates on deposits, it would encourage
depositors to put their money in uninsured money market mutual funds
offered by brokerage firms, he said.
   The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the largest S&amp;L trade
association, has said it cannot pay more toward the FSLIC's problems
and at the same time raise more capital from investors as a buffer
between losses and insured deposits.
   At the congressional hearings, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
noting an estimate that insolvent S&amp;Ls are losing $1 billion a
month, said Congress should give regulators about $2 billion
immediately so they can liquidate some institutions rather than
rescuing them with promissory notes and loss guarantees.
   ``I have to believe that an immediate infusion of about $2
billion for the next six months or so would save us money in the
long run,'' he said.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., agreed, saying, ``It's probably
going to be six, seven, eight months at best'' until Congress acts
on a reform package.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., while not specifically backing
Dodd's proposal, said, ``I think we have to consider acting more
rapidly.''
   The committee chairman, Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., is
against spending any money on the problem without tying it to
reforms needed to prevent the problem from reoccurring. But he said
regulators were free to ask Congress for more money.
   William Fulwider, a spokesman for the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, said the agency would wait until the Bush administration
presented its proposal before deciding whether to ask Congress for
interim financing.
   The bank board has already advocated that Congress allow it to
speed up the sale of the remaining $5 billion in previously
authorized bonds rather than spread the borrowing through 1990, as
now required.

<HEAD>Earnings Rise in Double Digits at Warner-Lambert, Schering-Plough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Schering-Plough Corp. said Tuesday its fourth-quarter earnings
rose 24 percent and attributed the rise to strong performances in
international sales.
   Another big drug and consumer products company, Warner-Lambert
Co., also cited sales gains in reporting its earnings for the same
period jumped 17 percent.
   Schering-Plough, based in Madison, N.J., said it earned $92.9
million, or 83 cents per share, in the final quarter of 1988, up
from $75.2 million, or 67 cents per share, in the same period a year
earlier.
   Sales for the fourth quarter totaled $739.9 million, a 12 percent
rise over $663.5 million the year before.
   Robert P. Luciano, chairman and chief executive officer, said
international sales turned in an ``exceptional'' performance during
the quarter.
   Warner-Lambert, headquartered in Morris Plains, N.J., said it
earned $77.5 million, or $1.14 per share, in the fourth quarter, up
from $66.3 million, or 95 cents per share, in the same period of
1987.
   Sales increased 11 percent to $997.9 million from $899 million.
   Joseph D. Williams, Warner-Lambert's chairman and chief executive
officer, attributed the performance to strong sales in the United
States and abroad.
   For all of 1988, Schering-Plough reported earnings of $389.8
million, or $3.48 per share, up 23.2 percent from $316.4 million, or
$2.73 per share, during 1987.
   Sales in 1988 were $2.97 billion, a 10 percent rise over the $2.7
billion reported in 1987.
   Warner-Lambert said it earned $340.3 million, or $5 per share,
during 1988, up 15 percent from $295.8 million, or $4.15 per share,
in 1987.
   Sales increased 14 percent to $3.91 billion from $3.44 billion.
