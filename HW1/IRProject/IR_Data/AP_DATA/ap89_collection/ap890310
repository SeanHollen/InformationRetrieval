   A surfer was killed after a shark
dragged him from his board while bathers watched in horror at a
popular South Australia beach, police said today.
   Police said the injured surfer died as his friend towed him 200
yards to the beach. The attack came while the two men surfed off
Waitpinga Beach, 50 miles south of Adelaide, just before dusk
Thursday.
   Police said the victim, 27-year-old Matthew Foale, was dangling
his leg in the water when the shark grabbed it and dragged him
underwater.
   An autopsy was to be held later today to determine cause of
death, which may be drowning or loss of blood from a severed artery,
officials said.
   South Australian waters are notorious for shark attacks. In
October, a shark dragged a teen-ager from his surfboard but the boy
escaped by punching the shark on the snout. He needed more than 110
stitches for wounds to his leg.

<TEXT>
   A man was sentenced to seven months in prison for
threatening to kill Nagasaki's mayor after the official said the
late Emperor Hirohito bore some responsibility for World War II.
   Nagasaki District Court officials said Masato Saito, 26, was
sentenced Thursday. He was arrested Jan. 5 after he broke into city
hall, armed with a knife, in an attempt to force Mayor Hitoshi
Motoshima to retract his statement on the emperor's war
responsibility.
   Hirohito, who held divine status until Japan's defeat in the war
in 1945, died on Jan. 7 of intestinal cancer. He was 87.
   Saito's arrest came about nine weeks after the mayor stated in a
municipal assembly session that the then-ailing emperor could have
ended the war sooner and spared Nagasaki from being attacked with a
U.S. atomic bomb in the war's closing days.
   The mayor's remarks angered Japanese right-wing groups, who
generally promote respect for the emperor.

   Here is a transcript of a statement by John
Tower shortly after the Senate rejected President Bush's nomination
of him to be defense secretary.
   It is time for the bitterness, rancor and anger to fade, and for
those elements of government who have been involved in the
confirmation process to unite and to be about the people's business.
   I will be recorded as the first Cabinet nominee in the history of
the republic to be rejected in the first 90 days of a presidency and
perhaps be harshly judged.
   But I depart from this place at peace with myself, knowing that I
have given a full measure of devotion to my country.
   No public figure in my memory has been subjected to such a
far-reaching and thorough investigation nor had his human foibles
bared to such intensive and demeaning public scrutiny.
   And yet, there is no finding that I have ever breached
established legal and ethical standards nor been derelict in my duty.
   I am deeply grateful to our great president for his continuing
confidence in me and his unflagging support in the most difficult of
circumstances.
   I am obliged to my old colleagues in the Senate who rallied to me
with fervor, zeal and eloquence in the face of staggering political
odds.
   I shall always be in their debt.
   I am thankful to the thousands of Americans who have inundated me
with messages of encouragement and support.
   It is my intention to return to private life in my beloved Texas.
   But I shall speak out from time to time on national issues when
my knowledge, experience and insights may contribute to public
debate.
   I hope that my successor will be speedily and expeditiously
confirmed and I wish him Godspeed.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One U.S. Embassy librarian remembers
handing a copy of Billboard magazine through an iron gate, past a
militiaman, to a young Pole interested in keeping up with the
Western pop music scene.
   It was a time of martial law and authorities frowned on such
things.
   During that bitter winter of 1981-82, and for years before and
after, the library at the U.S. Embassy and ones run by British and
French institutes have been virtually the only source of Western
news, books and magazines for Poles.
   The official information lock has eased some.
   Authorities no longer bother to check luggage at airports, video
stores are opening in Warsaw, the jamming of foreign broadcasts has
ended, satellite dishes bring a world full of signals into the
country, an underground press publishes vigorously, and the official
media provide a broader range of views.
   But still no Western newspapers are on sale regularly in Warsaw,
and Newsweek magazine circulates a few hundred copies for a country
of nearly 38 million.
   At the U.S. Embassy library, however, anyone can come in for
English-language fiction, magazines ranging from House &amp; Garden to
Fortune, college catalogues, reference works or even American
telephone books.
   ``This library is very famous because books are here that you
cannot get anywhere else,'' said a woman researching her doctoral
thesis on Martin Luther King Jr.
   The U.S. Information Agency pays for embassy libraries worldwide,
spending about $15,000 annually to stock the Warsaw branch.
   In Poland, the agency also supports smaller reading rooms at U.S.
Consulates in Krakow and Poznan and a scholarly study center at
Warsaw University.
   The embassy library has about 8,000 volumes of fiction and
non-fiction and 136 magazines, covering ``wide spectrum of political
thought ... from National Review to New Republic,'' said Alice
Lemaistre, the U.S. cultural officer.
   She describes the library as a way of ``filling in the gaps'' in
Poles' understanding of the United States.
   She said it is important, for example, that Poles considering
emigrating to the United States understand how much housing costs.
   The British Institute, which operates independently of the
British Embassy, runs a 28,000-volume library in Warsaw and branches
in four cities.
   Planes carrying books were among the first to arrive in the
post-World War II relief operation, said the institute's director,
Richard Alford.
   ``It was a much more risky proposition for Poles to come here
during the (Stalinist) 1950s,'' said Alford. ``Now, nobody thinks
twice about it.''
   One patron during the relatively relaxed 1970s recalls the
American library as the ``in'' place to be seen for high school
students studying English.
   The British library has a computer link to a Western database for
research that had been running for only a few days in 1981 before
martial law was declared and communications links cut.
   The re-established system serves Polish scholars whose libraries
do not have the money to buy specialized books and journals from the
West.
   Militia officers posted outside the U.S. Embassy discouraged
library use during martial-law, and the government press reported,
falsely, that it was closed.
   Still, Poles came. Testimony to their determination is the worn
copy of Herman Wouk's ``The Caine Mutiny'' with the library card
recording a due date of Jan. 4, 1982, three weeks after martial law
was imposed.
   Now, about 4,300 people have library cards at the U.S. libary and
up to 150 people pass through the embassy metal detector to use it
daily.
   Newsweek, Time and the International Herald Tribune, which is
published in Paris, are ``read to death,'' said Ms. Lamaistre.
   One day recently, a Polish music writer was catching up on
Rolling Stone magazine, and a student was checking out ``Trouble
Spots of English Grammar.''
   Art, theater and film _ both libraries show movies in English _
are favorite topics and computer magazines are newly popular.
   Also well-thumbed are copies of such decorating magazines as
Metropolitan Home and do-it-yourself guides, a result of the
improvisation that takes over when the store shelves are empty.
   ``There is a voracious appetite for anything in the way of
Western literature,'' said Runnall Davis, head of the British
Council Library where about 90 percent of the 7,000 fiction titles
are on loan at any time.
   ``We are a window to the West,'' he said. ``This is one place
where Poles can come and see things from a different point of view.''

   In Northern Ireland's endless cycle of killing
and revenge, the combined weight of statistics and rhetoric often
eclipses the human tragedy. Here is a report from an AP
correspondent who studied the poignant details behind the latest
killing.

<DATELINE>COAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On an unseasonably warm and sunny
day this week, the official death toll in the Northern Ireland
conflict went up by one stock car racer, one violin-maker and one
nearly blind old-age pensioner.
   Leslie Dallas, Austin Nelson and Ernie Rankin were chatting in
the forecourt of Dallas's garage in Coagh on Tuesday when an Irish
Republican Army squad drove up in a red car and shot them dead.
   Why? Because 40-year-old Dallas was running the garage as a front
for a Protestant murder squad, said the IRA. Because the IRA are
sectarian killers, said the police. Because of unavenged previous
slayings, said the analysts.
   Three Protestants killed in an obscure County Tyrone village may
be mere statistical blips in the larger picture of the IRA's
68-year-fight for a united Ireland, and the Protestants' equally
dogged struggle to remain part of Britain.
   But to Coagh they were local heroes: Dallas as a driving champ,
Nelson as a violin-maker who had just been featured on network TV,
and Rankin as the jovial old codger who played the role of village
``character.''
   The garage stands on a corner of Hanover Square where generations
of villagers have stopped to shoot the breeze, and the IRA admits
that Nelson, 68, and Rankin, 71, were innocent bystanders who were
killed ``in the general confusion.''
   On the morning after the killings, Coagh (pronounced Coke) was
wrapped in an overpowering sense of lives abruptly cut down.
   The raw shell of an unfinished violin lay on Nelson's work table.
Two doors down, in Dallas' garage, an uncompleted worksheet was
spread on a desk, and his racing trophies lined the windowsill.
   A red carnation was jammed in the garage padlock. Bunches of
daffodils lay on the asphalt by the bullet-pocked garage wall.
   Such random death is depressingly common in Northern Ireland.
Ordinary people die in the cross-fire, or because they happened by
just as a bomb exploded. They may die simply because of their
religion, or because they have a brother in the IRA, or because of
mistaken identity.
   ``It's the ordinary people who suffer, and no two ways about
it,'' snapped Nan Duff, a neighbor who saw the bodies lying by the
garage.
   She could just as well have been referring to Phelim McNally, or
Tony Fusco, Barney Lavery or Ian Catney, or 13-year-old Emma
Donnelly _ just some of the people who have been killed ``by
mistake'' in recent months.
   Phelim McNally loved children _ at 28 he already had five _ and
playing the accordion. His brother Francis is a pro-IRA politician,
but Phelim was never involved in anything that might single him out
for murder.
   In November he delivered his pregnant wife Pauline to the
hospital and went to Francis' house to give his 10-year-old nephew
an accordion lesson. Someone knocked at the door. Francis went to
the window. Phelim, less schooled in the art of survival, opened the
door and was shot dead.
   Four hours later, Pauline gave birth to their sixth child. Death
can have a grisly way of becoming a family event in Northern
Ireland. Dallas, for instance, died in front of his children. They
had just gotten off their school bus.
   Then there was Barney Lavery, 67, driving home with his
13-year-old granddaughter Emma Donnelly when an IRA bomb went off
outside a police station in Benburb and killed them.
   Emma was junior camogie (women's hurling) player of the year.
Lavery had been the number-caller at the bingo evening to raise
funds for the Ancient Order of Hibernians. The IRA apologized for
the mistake.
   On Jan. 18, Ian Catney, 26, was shot dead by Protestant gunmen
behind the counter of his mother's gift shop in Belfast. On Feb. 9,
Tony Fusco was gunned down while waiting for his daily ride to his
job at a glass factory.
   Both were Catholics. Neither had any known political links. The
Ulster Volunteer Force, a Protestant paramilitary group, claimed
responsibility. As the priest said at Fusco's funeral, it was
``guilt by association, guilt by family name, guilt by unfounded
suspicion, collective and community guilt, guilt by religion...''
   Austin Nelson was a retired truck driver who had turned to making
violins in the shed behind his house. The television documentary
about him was aired the night before he died.
   ``The film was the talk of the town on Tuesday. Dad was so
proud,'' said his son, Michael, 26. ``Two ladies came by. They'd
seen the film and asked to him to play them a tune. One of the
ladies told him that even though she met him only for a short time,
she'd remember him for the rest of her life.''
   Ernie Rankin was a life-long bachelor and soccer fanatic who
stood out by his white, shoulder-length hair. Being nearly blind, he
would sit inches from the TV screen to watch the games.
   He liked having the local youngsters over for big matches and
would make them tea while they watched the soccer. Among the
qualities the villagers remember was his extraordinary ability to
loop his leg around his neck.
   On Tuesday, Ernie dropped in on Austin. Then he ambled over to
the garage to see who was around for a chat. A few minutes later,
Austin put down the violin he was working on and headed off to join
him. The stolen car carrying the three IRA attackers was already on
its way to Coagh.
   The killings in Coagh pushed the death toll since 1969 to 2,727.
Sixty-nine percent of the dead were civilians.

   A taxi company owner and his wife who
jokingly spiked a party cake with a laxative have been sentenced to
75 days in jail on a battery conviction.
   Martin Yauch, 38, and Lois M. Yauch, 40, originally charged with
placing a foreign substance in edibles, pleaded guilty in November
to a reduced charge of misdemeanor battery. They were sentenced
Thursday.
   Investigators said the couple placed a commercial laxative in a
cake at a company party in May 1987 as a prank. Some employees
became ill but none required hospitalization.
   The Circuit Court jail sentence involves the state's Huber Law,
under which the couple can leave jail during working hours.

   The countdown began early Friday for
a Monday launch of space shuttle Discovery with a crew of five
astronauts and a powerful communications satellite.
   The clock began ticking as test conductor Jerry Crute issued the
traditional call to stations to the launch team. The initial task
was to electrically activate the spaceship's thousands of systems.
   The launch will be the 28th shuttle mission and the third since
the Challenger explosion killed all seven aboard more than three
years ago.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 8:07 a.m. EST Monday. During five days
in orbit, the astronauts will deploy a $100 million communications
satellite and conduct scientific experiments.
   Steady rain slowed work at the launch pad Thursday, but National
Aeronautics and Space Administration spokeswoman Lisa Malone said it
would not delay the countdown.
   Air Force weather officials said the outlook for Monday was ``go
for launch'' with a forecast of scattered clouds, light winds,
visibility seven miles and temperature 62 degrees.
   The astronauts will fly here Friday from their training base in
Houston to make final preparations for launch.
   The commander is Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats; the pilot is Air
Force Col. John E. Blaha, and the mission specialists are Marine
Cols. James F. Buchli and Robert C. Springer and Dr. James M.
Bagian, a medical doctor.
   It will be the second shuttle flight for Coats and the third for
Buchli. The others are space rookies.
   They are scheduled to return to Earth on March 18, landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., at 6:14 a.m. PST.

   Jack O'Brien often performs before an
empty House, but he's virtually guaranteed an encore.
   Alone beneath the crystal chandeliers and solemn portraits of the
state House chamber, O'Brien sometimes drones on for hours at a time
in the early days of a legislative session, addressing 118 empty
chairs _ and occasionally a doorman.
   As House clerk, it's his lonely job to fulfill an obscure
constitutional requirement that the title of every bill be read
aloud before it is considered by lawmakers.
   ``It's a mechanical thing of really just going through, reading
and turning papers as fast as you can,'' said O'Brien, a 20-year
veteran of the job. ``It's just a constitutional requirement.''
   The requirement was meant to ensure that lawmakers and other
interested parties know what measures are under consideration, but
the mandate appears merely quaint in an information-saturated age
when bills are dissected by staff analysts, touted by lobbyists,
trumpeted in press releases or preserved on computer disks.
   So House rules authorize so-called ``perfunctory sessions'' that
spare lawmakers the torture of sitting through the litany of
legislation _ 4,298 House bills in the 1987-88 session alone.
   ``Probably the longest day we've had was the 1975 deadline for
filing bills when there was 1,021 of them,'' he said. ``It was a
long, long day.''
   On designated days, O'Brien walks into the deserted chamber,
turns on the public address system and, functioning as speaker,
chaplain and clerk, calls the House to order, says a prayer and
reads bills.
   ``Maybe it's a waste of effort,'' said Emery Koehler, head
doorkeeper of the House and a faithful member of O'Brien's audience.
``That's not my personal opinion, but a lot of people might draw
that conclusion.''
   O'Brien said there are times when he's tempted to liven things up
a bit. But because the sound system carries his words to various
state offices _ and to tape recorders that preserve the ``sessions''
for posterity _ he said he's cautious when encouraged to break from
the script.
   ``There's a little horseplay around the chamber,'' he said.
``When there's pages in the chamber ... they've tried their best to
break me up. I'm an attraction there that they can't resist.''
   Though it often seems that no one is paying attention, O'Brien
said he knows that's not the case.
   ``All I have to do is one thing wrong _ whatever it might be,
mispronunciation or some other side remark _ and I find out in a
hurry how many people who do hear me and do listen,'' he said.

<HEAD>Nigerian Student Suspended over Child Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Nigerian medical student charged with
child abuse who says he was only disciplining his daughter in a way
acceptable in his culture has been suspended by the University of
Florida for one year.
   The decision by Art Sandeen, vice president for student affairs,
means Fons Amaye-Obu is suspended from classes until after the
spring semester of 1990, the student's attorney, Horace Moore, said
Wednesday.
   Moore is appealing the decision to university Provost Bob Bryan,
who is to become acting president later this month.
   Amaye-Obu, 34, faces criminal charges of aggravated child abuse
since his 15-year-old daughter accused him of beating her in August
at their campus apartment.
   Amaye-Obu, saying the university has no right to intervene in
family affairs, appealed his case to Sandeen after the Student
Conduct Committee recommended expulsion.
   Under the suspension, Amaye-Obu could graduate after returning in
the summer of next year. A fourth-year student, he lacks only two
months of school and a medical internship before completing his
medical education.
   Amaye-Obu, separated from the girl's mother, said he struck his
daughter after she shouted at him when he asked her to put dinner on
the table. The police report says the girl's eyelids and lips were
swollen and she had a bruised nose, which Amaye-Obu denies.
   Moore said he showed Sandeen that the daughter had good grades
when she was living with her father, but has not done as well in
school since moving out last fall.
   ``It appears as though we've totally disregarded his daughter's
welfare and need for strong parental guidance,'' Moore said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His adversaries, even a few subordinates, used
to call him the Littlest Caesar in Washington, a nickname as
prophetic as it was derisive. In the end, just shy of the ides of
March, John Tower was done in by his fellow patricians in the Senate.
   He wanted so badly to crown his public career as secretary of
defense he even swore abstinence, sort of, from the nectar of grape
and grain. A Texas friend, George Bush, continued to swear by him.
But those oaths were not enough to win Tower the oath of office.
   The Senate's 53-47 vote late Thursday sealed the first rejection
in history of a Cabinet nominee of a newly elected president. More
astonishing to some is that the Senate turned against one of its
own, a four-termer who once headed the very committee, Armed
Services, that dealt the cruelest blow by declaring him, on a
largely party-line vote, unfit.
   Tower, 63, surely is among the least surprised that knives were
drawn by his former colleagues in the once-fabled, self-protective
society of the Senate, which never before had rejected a former
senator for an executive post.
   Twenty-two years ago, Tower waged a lonely battle against the
censure of Democratic Sen. Thomas Dodd, the late father of current
Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. He recalled then that Sen.
Prescott Bush, another Connecticut senator and the late father of
the president, had once been asked by a young woman if senators
really were courteous and deferential to each other, regardless of
political belief.
   ``He replied: `Yes, young lady, it is true ... but when one of us
breaks a leg, we eat him.'''
   Broken leg or not, Tower may have been particularly vulnerable to
those carnivorous instincts. He left the Senate in 1985 with an
especially low reservoir of good will for a departing committee
chairman.
   He had monumental confrontations with leaders of his own party,
much less the Democrats who watched him ram Ronald Reagan's massive
defense budgets through the Senate. He waged jurisdictional wars
with other Republican chairmen, and few members were spared his acid
tongue in floor debates.
   Indeed, the only Senate club that John Tower seemed to care about
was the one he figuratively carried on his shoulder. Compromise was
not his cup of tea. He once refused, even, to shake hands with the
Democratic congressman, Robert Krueger, who dared run against him in
1978.
   ``John Tower is a former member of the Senate, but it is probably
also the case that he doesn't have a lot of intimate friends here or
any aura of popularity or good will,'' said Republican Sen. Richard
Luger of Indiana. ``He is not necessarily a person who ingratiates
himself with anybody.''
   Still, he fared well with the electorate of Texas, which put him
into the Senate in 1961 when the Republican Party could have held
its state conventions in a phone booth. He won three more terms
before retiring from the Senate in 1985.
   He didn't lack for cockiness. At a 1979 costume party in Dallas,
the 5-foot-6 Tower turned up in a Superman suit, a rare departure
from his tailored pinstriped suits and Saville Row cotton shirts.
``I was born to play Superman,'' he said. ``I'm a man who stands for
truth, justice and the American way.''
   To him that meant bashing liberal Democrats for ``creeping
socialism,'' supporting a greater war effort in Vietnam _ he still
believes the United States should have won _ and striving for
military superiority, not just parity, against the Soviet Union.
   Twice divorced, he was long the subject of rumors about his
personal life. His second wife, Lilla, divorced him in 1987 after
charging him with ``marital misconduct.'' Last week, he acknowledged
only that he had broken his wedding vows.
   But stories about his drinking were the most damaging. Tower at
first denied that he'd had a problem with alcohol. Later he admitted
that he was ``a pretty good scotch drinker'' in the 1970s but said
he drank only moderately in recent years, mainly wine.
   Others didn't see it that way. The FBI, according to Sen. Ernest
F. Hollings, D-S.C., turned up ``corroborated facts _ with words
`crocked,' `bombed,' `excessive drinking,' `sloshing,' `stoned,'
`comatose' ...''
   Many of those accounts came from sources with little or no
credibility. But several came from Americans with no apparent ax to
grind with Tower, even former aides and defense industry executives.
   Though his confirmation hearings opened with a tide of good will,
many senators became disturbed by Tower's dodginess and pattern of
denial over the alcohol issue. He admitted to ``excessive
drinking,'' but steadfastly asserted he had not ``abused'' alcohol.
He claimed his switch from scotch to wine was evidence of
moderation, a refrain often heard from problem drinkers who fail to
acknowledge that average servings of wine, beer or liquor all have
the same alcoholic content. He took a pledge of abstinence, but
conditioned it on confirmation _ he continued to drink wine, he
said, in the meantime. To some, that too smacked of the problem
drinker's claim that he or she can quit any time _ but not just now.
   Then too, there were concerns about Tower's coziness with the
defense industry, especially in light of his million-dollar-plus
earnings as a consultant for the likes of Martin Marietta, LTV,
Rockwell and Textron. Between those jobs, he took on two key
assignments from Reagan, first as a strategic arms negotiator, then
as head of the presidential panel that investigated the Iran-Contra
scandal.
   Even his severest critics gave him high marks for his Iran-Contra
report, but the reviews were mixed about his stint in Geneva, where
Tower apparently was bored as a negotiator with the Soviets. More
troubling, according to Democrats, was Tower's own testimony that he
later counseled defense contractors on their sales prospects in
light of his perception of the likely outcome of those confidential
talks. Tower denied that he shared any secrets or that any conflict
of interest was involved.

<HEAD>`It's Incredible,' Says Conductor of 7 Million Singing Kids</HEAD>

   Band director William P. Foster thought he'd
done it all, from Macy's Thanksgiving Day parades to more than 200
football halftimes. But now he was lifting his baton for the
challenge of a lifetime.
   With help from a global TV hookup, Foster conducted what
promoters billed as ``the world's largest concert.'' He led no fewer
than 7 million school kids in a songfest Thursday that spanned the
United States and reached from Tunisia to the Philippines.
   But Foster is an old pro, and he didn't flinch.
   Natty in a high-collared white uniform with gold buttons, he
mounted the podium in the Kennedy Center's Grand Foyer to conduct
400 local school children in a half-hour choral program performed
simultaneously by millions of other youngsters via television.
   Among them were the ``Singing Bears'' of Coral Park Elementary
School who sang along at a shopping mall in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. In
Ohio, the Columbus Symphony Youth Orchestra played host for 2,800
local school children, and more than 4,000 youngsters from across
Colorado gathered at three sites in the Denver area to join the
singing.
   One hundred children from 20 countries who attend an American
school in Tunis sang under Foster's televised baton at the U.S.
Embassy in the Tunisian capital. Others chimed in from West Germany,
Guam and American Samoa.
   Although it was midday Thursday in Washington, it was nighttime
when 170 singers and band members performed from schools in the
Marshall Islands, 2,400 miles southwest of Hawaii. Nearly 600 pupils
chimed in from an elementary school at the U.S. naval base at Subic
Bay in the Philippines.
   They all followed Foster's conducting cues on seven selections
including Woody Guthrie's ``This Land is Your Land'' and Irving
Berlin's ``God Bless America.'' The same music had been performed by
2,400 children in a performance taped last November in the Brooklyn
Academy of Music.
   The concert was broadcast Thursday by 315 public broadcasting
stations nationwide and by the Armed Forces Radio and Television
network to American schools at military bases and U.S. embassies
overseas.
   ``It's an incredible experience,'' said Foster, director of bands
at Florida A&amp;M University at Tallahassee for the past 42 years.
   Even though his own marching band and its precision-drill
exploits have been seen by millions of people at football halftimes
_ including the 1969 Super Bowl _ nationally televised parades and
TV soft drink commercials, Foster said, ``this was a big deal.''
   This press agent's dream is produced annually by the Music
Educators National Conference, a non-profit association of 58,000
music teachers and administrators, to dramatize the importance of
music studies in the schools. The mass sing-along, which began in
1985, was underwritten this year by McDonald's Corp.
   Opera soprano Susan Dunn, who began her singing career in school
and church choirs in her hometown of Bauxite, Ark., told the Kennedy
Center singers that she hoped their part in the worldwide concert
would encourage other youngsters to study music.
   ``I know first hand that music is more than singing and learning
rhythm,'' said Miss Dunn, who is starring this week in a Washington
Opera production.
   ``Music is intrinsically valuable, and is a crucial element in
the school curriculum because it helps our children develop their
creativity and self-discipline,'' she said.

   Opposition leaders praised a government
agreement to create a new national legislature with freely elected
members, but they say open elections on the local level must be the
next step toward true democracy.
   Government and opposition negotiators, in a breakthrough that
could give Poland the first democratic national elections in the
communist bloc, agreed Thursday to add a second chamber of
parliament open to all candidates.
   The agreement also calls for 35 percent of the seats in the
existing parliament, the Seijm, to be open to opposition candidates.
   Additionally, the sides agreed in principle to establish a post
of president who would be elected by a majority of both chambers of
Parliament, which would form the National Assembly.
   Opposition figures cautioned that the tentaive reforms only are a
first step toward substantive democratic reform.
   ``If the process of the democratization is to work, it must
include solutions of such problems as local governments which would
be elected in completely free elections,'' said Bronislaw Geremek,
head of the opposition group negotiating with the government on
political reform.
   He also called for opposition access to mass media and freedom to
create associations.
   ``Such reform cannot begin and end at the top authorities,''
opposition negotiator Zbigniew Bujak told state television late
Thursday. ``It must also be made from the bottom.''
   Authorities have insisted on elections in June, leaving the
independents little time to mount effective campaigns.
   Candidates for the new parliamentary chamber, provisionally
called the ``senate,'' can be nominated by an existing group or
gather 5,000 signatures to run, said Janusz Reykowski, a government
negotiator.
   Reykowski is the leader of the government side on the working
group dealing with political reforms, part of the broader talks
between opposition and the government on Poland's future.
   Opposition negotiators said the number of members in the future
sentate still remained to be negotiated.
   They also said the agreement on free elections to the senate was
part of a trade-off for conceding that Poland would have a strong
presidency, which likely would remain in Communist Party control.
   The powers of the president still are to be debated, but the idea
is to combine in the presidency powers now held by the Council of
State, such as appointing the head of the army and names
ambassadors. The president also would be able to dissolve parliament
and call new elections.
   There has been wide speculation that if a presidency is
established, the post would be filled by communist party First
Secretary Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Reykowski said the proposed new election law would be submitted
to the Sejm as early as next week. The communist party now has an
absolute majority in the Sejm and any laws proposed by the party are
assured passage.
   The electoral changes are part of a package of political and
economic reforms being negotiated since Feb. 6 at the talks between
the authorities and opposition.
   The talks also have resulted in tentative agreement to restore
the banned trade union Solidarity, the farmers' union rural
Solidarity and the Independent Students' Association.
   Solidarity, under the leadership of Lech Walesa, had refused to
come to the negotiating table until the communist party agreed in
principle to restore its legal status, stripped away after the
December 1981 martial-law crackdown.
   Both sides must agree to the entire package for the reforms to
take effect. After a meeting with government officials on Tuesday,
Walesa said the two sides hope to complete work and sign a new
national accord April 3.
   Geremek said entering free elections poses risks for both sides.
   The communist authorities for the first time face ``a test of the
basis of the ruling coaliton.'' But the opposition is at risk
because it is ``completely unprepared'' for competition at the polls.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's defeat on the nomination of
John Tower demonstrates that a Congress dominated by Democrats is
not afraid of him and stands ready to trade blows with the White
House in other tests of power.
   For Bush, the best thing about the long and messy ordeal over
Tower was that it finally came to an end. After a bitter six-day
debate, the Senate killed Tower's hopes of running the Pentagon on a
53-47 vote.
   For weeks, the struggle over Tower had sapped the energy of
Bush's new White House, requiring countless telephone calls and
trips to Capitol Hill by chief of staff John Sununu.
   Allegations against Tower of excessive drinking, womanizing and
conflict of interest with defense contractors diverted attention
from subjects Bush wanted to highlight, and the whole episode
provoked charges of White House bungling.
   Even though Bush insisted the allegations against Tower were
groundless, the nomination reinforced the notion that Bush sometimes
has a blind spot when it comes to picking the right people.
   The White House version of events made it sound as if Tower's
defeat wasn't such a bad thing, after all.
   ``Out of this struggle has come a good unity with the Republican
Party,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``We
brought the administration team together and we feel that it's been
a tempering affair that should serve us well as we move forward.''
   Bush did show that even though the odds were against him, he
didn't back down and yank Tower's nomination. He made a stand for
loyalty and the right of a president to pick his own men.
   But the bottom line, of course, was that Bush was defeated in his
first showdown with Congress.
   In the first three months to six months, a new president develops
an image that becomes a stereotype. ``This is beginning to shape
that image in the wrong way for Bush,'' said Norm Ornstein, a
specialist in the presidency at the American Enterprise Institute.
``It's not fully formed yet but a few more things like this and
he'll have a very bad image he'll have to overcome.''
   Moreover, Ornstein said, ``The degree of respect and fear that
every president wants in his relationship with Congress is not going
to be there as much'' after Tower's defeat.
   For world leaders, Bush's loss could be a source of uneasiness.
   ``It tells them they're dealing with a weaker president than
Ronald Reagan,'' said William Schneider, a political analyst at AEI.
``If you reach a deal with this man, will it stick? Can he sell it
to Congress?''
   Richard Brody, a Stanford University political science professor,
said Tower's defeat may make Bush more cautious on other
nominations, particularly in choosing Supreme Court candidates if
vacancies arise.
   ``With the Democrats _ cutting across ideological lines _ willing
to hang together on this one, it may signal that Supreme Court
nominees are not going to get a free ride,'' Brody said.
   Mindful that the Democrats run Congress and that he'll have to
deal with them again, Bush carefully refrained from doing anything
that would drive a wedge between the White House and Congress.
   He held back on some weapons that are available to the president.
For instance, there were no televised addresses from the Oval Office
on Tower's behalf, no direct challenge to any of Tower's critics.
   Bush seems eager to close the book on the whole affair. ``We owe
it to the American people to come together and move forward,'' Bush
said after the vote.
   Senate Democrats said they, too, did not want the Tower fight to
ruin relations with Bush. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman
Sam Nunn and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell made a hurried
telephone call to Bush after the vote, pledging to work in a
cooperative and productive spirit.
   ``This doesn't represent an effort to be harmful to the
president,'' Mitchell told reporters. ``I hope and believe we can
work together on important matters. The tension of this issue will
have no long-lasting effect on the relationship.''
   No one suggests that Tower's defeat has crippled Bush. The public
didn't seem much interested, and Bush's popularity remains high in
public opinion polls.
   Raymond Wolfinger, a political scientist at the University of
California at Berkeley, said Tower may have been merely ``teething
troubles'' for Bush. ``Lots of presidents learn from mistakes early
in their administration.''

   Tchaikovsky's ``Eugene Onegin'' _ not heard at
the Metropolitan Opera since the 1984-85 season _ returned with a
cast that assures a satisfying evening.
   All the principals were announced as singing their roles for the
first time at the Met, but soprano Mirella Freni had the flu so
Tatyana was sung by Makvala Kasrashvili, a native of the Soviet
Union who made her Met debut as Tatyana in 1979.
   Her voice is splendidly suited to the part. Her soft notes and
high notes are especially lovely.
   Sandra Walker of Richmond, as her sister Olga, has a
mezzo-soprano so rich she sounds more matronly than girlish, but yet
it's a beautiful voice.
   Both acted well. Miss Kasrashvili conveyed a young woman, not
sought out by men, who suddenly awakens into love with the
well-dressed stranger, Onegin. Miss Walker's acting also was
effective. In the Act 2 party when Onegin dances with Olga because
he's bored, she's a bit excited about flirting with him.
   Jorma Hynninen of Finland sang Onegin pleasingly and Jerry Hadley
of Princeton, Ill., was excellent as Olga's jealous fiance. Hadley's
singing sounded Italian sometimes in the first act but he was clear,
forthright and ringing in Act 2, which ends with him shot by Onegin
in a duel.
   Other notable singers who added to the evening's enjoyment were
bass Nicolai Ghiaurov of Bulgaria, who appears in Act 3 as Tatyana's
husband, Gweneth Bean of Battle Creek, Mich., as Tatyana's nurse in
Act 1 and Michel Senechal of Paris who has one aria, in French, as
Tatyana's tutor.
   Andrew Litton of New York, principal conductor of the
Bournemouth, England, Symphony, was making his Met debut. Instead of
trying for the rousing, he drew out and savored orchestral
interludes. He held the orchestra quiet while singers held final
notes as long as they wished. He conducted some of the arias so
slowly one wondered whether the singers had difficulty.
   The scenery for ``Eugene Onegin'' dates back to 1957. The
production was revised in 1977 with new staging, costumes and
choreography for six couples at Act 2 and 3 parties. The revised
production changed the language of presentation from English to the
original Russian.

<HEAD>U.S. Team Returns Home After Laos Delays MIA Project</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. military team returned home today
after the Laotian government, angered by U.S. charges it encouraged
narcotics trafficking, delayed a joint project to search for remains
of missing American soldiers.
   The 14 specialists returned from Bangkok to Honolulu after Laos
failed to give them clearance to enter for the project that was to
begin Saturday, said Ross Petzing, spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in
Bangkok.
   Petzing said the United States appreciated Laos' past cooperation
in accounting for Americans missing from the Indochina war, and
added: ``We hope this mission can be rescheduled.''
   It was to have been the fifth joint excavation of a U.S. warplane
crash site to account for 547 Americans listed as missing in action
from the war that ended in 1975. The U.S. experts on the excavations
are from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the Army
Central Identification Laboratory, both based in Honolulu.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said on Monday he
understood the delay was related to an annual U.S. government report
the previous week critical of Laos' performance in international
efforts to curb drug production and trafficking.
   The report listed a handful of countries that it declared
ineligible for U.S. aid because of their support for drug
trafficking. In the report, President Bush recommended that Burma
and Laos be added to that list.
   Opium production is expanding in Laos, the report said. Evidence
of extensive involvement in the narcotics trade by Laotian military
and civilian officials ``suggests that this is a matter of de facto
government policy,' it said.
   A March 4 broadcast over official Laotian radio denied the
government encouraged anyone in the drug trade and said it was
actually cracking down on it.
   ``The U.S. act of linking Laos to a narcotics issue and
announcing the suspension of its aid to Laos is unreasonable and
unconstructive,'' it said.
   Nevertheless, Laos will ``continue to fulfill our pledge of
giving cooperation to the United States in the search for the
remains of U.S. MIAS,'' it said.

   Japan is investing billions of dollars in
semiconductor manufacturing and support for advanced video systems,
according to congressional witnesses who say the United States may
face a defeat similar to those it suffered in TV and VCR
manufacturing 10 years ago.
   U.S. electronics companies are unlikely to try to enter the
high-definition TV arena unless they get protection from foreign
manufacturers, witnesses told a hearing Thursday of the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance.
   Robert Cohen, senior economist at the New York State Urban
Development Corp., said the Japanese in December committed another
$700 million for a total of $1.4 billion to speed development of
high-resolution display technology.
   The Japanese and Koreans have invested $6 billion for
construction of new semiconductor fabrication plants, he said, with
the governments making capital available at preferential rates.
   Those interest rates are from zero to 2 percent in Japan and from
2 percent to 4 percent in Europe, he said. U.S. companies,
meanwhile, pay double-digit rates for capital.
   The Bush adminstration is considering tax breaks and possible
changes in antitrust laws to spur a U.S. HDTV industry.
   U.S. makers of TV sets and VCRs were driven from the business in
the 1960s and 1970s, primarily because of collusion among Japanese
electronics companies, dumping of below-cost Japanese TV sets in
this country and kickbacks to U.S. importers, witnesses told the
panel.
   In the face of such market assaults, U.S. companies will be
reluctant to enter the potentially lucrative but enormously
expensive HDTV manufacturing arena, the panel was told.
   ``The American television industry was forced out by predatory
and vicious attacks here in this market, said Pat Choate, a vice
president at TRW Inc.
   ``It involved in effect a cartel that was sanctioned by the
Japanese government,'' Choate said. ``It involved massive dumping.
... There was a massive kickback scheme that was involved.''
   Choate said that for the United States to get back into the world
market in consumer electronics, the government must defend U.S.
manufacturers ``from predatory attacks, something that was not done
in the past.''
   Choate said the Japanese see HDTV as an essential element of the
nation's future well-being, ``like building highways ... like
developing other things that are absolute necessities.''
   The committee completed two days of hearings on what the
government role should be in the face of the revolutionary changes
that HDTV _ with its motion-picture clarity and large-screen
displays _ promises not only in entertainment, but in education,
medicine, automated manufacturing, communications and defense.
   Kenneth Flamm of the Brookings Institute said he wasn't sure that
there should be so much focus on HDTV, rather that the government
needed to help restructure the technical policy to support a new
commercial technological base.
   He said HDTV was less important than establishing networks of
cable fiber optics to link homes and businesses.
   ``HDTV is peripheral to that network,'' Flamm said.
   Other witnesses disputed that, saying HDTV, with its heavy use of
semi-conductors and memory chips, could be the driving force behind
a rejuvenated U.S. electronics industry. The subcommittee heard
testimony that there could be $140 billion in sales of HDTV
receivers and VCRs by the year 2010.
   Fred Branfman, director of the group Rebuild America, said the
United States needs all the new technologies and must find a way to
coordinate what Flamm termed the ``piecemeal'' approach to
electronics development.
   Subcommitee Chairman Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said that was
just what his subcommittee intended to do. But he said other
governments were out to protect their own interests, and when ``push
comes to shove,'' they will act.
   Clyde Prestowitz, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, also cautioned that the U.S. government
must tread carefully in any effort to protect the U.S. electronics
industry because U.S. companies also are trying to enter foreign
markets.
   The Defense Department is seeking companies to share $30 million
in HDTV research funds, and ``We might consider some reciprocity
requirement,'' conditioning foreign participation in U.S. efforts to
develop HDTV on the possibility of U.S. participation overseas,
Prestowitz said.
   Markey said the subcommittee planned to ``move very fast'' to
make recommendations on the government role in HDTV development.

   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has taken
control of 45 more failed savings and loans in eight states,
bringing the total under the agency's control to 118 thrift
institutions in 24 states.
   As an interim step, President Bush is having the agency, which
regulates commercial banks, take over the sickest S&amp;Ls, with the
goal of minimizing losses while Congress considers the
administration's proposal to rescue or close such institutions.
   The FDIC plans to take control of about 100 more institutions
within the next month. The agency is emphasizing that the S&amp;Ls will
remain open as usual and that all deposit accounts up to $100,000
are fully protected by federal insurance.
   The 45 institutions in Thursday's action, including 21 in Texas
and nine in Colorado, had assets totaling $13.6 billion. Listed by

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Congress Asserts Itself, Quickly, in Tower Episode</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's defeat on the nomination of
John Tower demonstrates that a Congress dominated by Democrats is
not afraid of him and stands ready to trade blows with the White
House in other tests of power.
   For Bush, the best thing about the long and messy ordeal over
Tower was that it finally came to an end. After a bitter six-day
debate, the Senate killed Tower's hopes of running the Pentagon on a
53-47 vote.
   For weeks, the struggle over Tower had sapped the energy of
Bush's new White House, requiring countless telephone calls and
trips to Capitol Hill by chief of staff John Sununu.
   Allegations against Tower of excessive drinking, womanizing and
conflict of interest with defense contractors diverted attention
from subjects Bush wanted to highlight, and the whole episode
provoked charges of White House bungling.
   Even though Bush insisted the allegations against Tower were
groundless, the nomination reinforced the notion that Bush sometimes
has a blind spot when it comes to picking the right people.
   The White House version of events made it sound as if Tower's
defeat wasn't such a bad thing, after all.
   ``Out of this struggle has come a good unity with the Republican
Party,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``We
brought the administration team together and we feel that it's been
a tempering affair that should serve us well as we move forward.''
   Bush did show that even though the odds were against him, he
didn't back down and yank Tower's nomination. He made a stand for
loyalty and the right of a president to pick his own men.
   But the bottom line, of course, was that Bush was defeated in his
first showdown with Congress.
   In the first three months to six months, a new president develops
an image that becomes a stereotype. ``This is beginning to shape
that image in the wrong way for Bush,'' said Norm Ornstein, a
specialist in the presidency at the American Enterprise Institute.
``It's not fully formed yet but a few more things like this and
he'll have a very bad image he'll have to overcome.''
   Moreover, Ornstein said, ``The degree of respect and fear that
every president wants in his relationship with Congress is not going
to be thee as much'' after Tower's defeat.
   For world leaders, Bush's loss could be a source of uneasiness.
   ``It tells them they're dealing with a weaker president than
Ronald Reagan,'' said William Schneider, a political analyst at AEI.
``If you reach a deal with this man, will it stick? Can he sell it
to Congress?''
   Richard Brody, a Stanford University political science professor,
said Tower's defeat may make Bush more cautious on other
nominations, particularly in choosing Supreme Court candidates if
vacancies arise.
   ``With the Democrats _ cutting across ideological lines _ willing
to hang together on this one, it may signal that Supreme Court
nominees are not going to get a free ride,'' Brody said.
   Mindful that the Democrats run Congress and that he'll have to
deal with them again, Bush carefully refrained from doing anything
that would drive a wedge between the White House and Congress.
   He held back on some weapons that are available to the president.
For instance, there were no televised addresses from the Oval Office
on Tower's behalf, no direct challenge to any of Tower's critics.
   Bush seems eager to close the book on the whole affair. ``We owe
it to the American people to come together and move forward,'' Bush
said after the vote.
   Senate Democrats said they, too, did not want the Tower fight to
ruin relations with Bush. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman
Sam Nunn and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell made a hurried
telephone call to Bush after the vote, pledging to work in a
cooperative and productive spirit.
   ``This doesn't represent an effort to be harmful to the
president,'' Mitchell told reporters. ``I hope and believe we can
work together on important matters. The tension of this issue will
have no long-lasting effect on the relationship.''
   No one suggests that Tower's defeat has crippled Bush. The public
didn't seem much interested, and Bush's popularity remains high in
public opinion polls.
   Raymond Wolfinger, a political scientist at the University of
California at Berkeley, said Tower may have been merely ``teething
troubles'' for Bush. ``Lots of presidents learn from mistakes early
in their administration.''

<HEAD>Schools Can be Improved with Little Spending, Group Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An influential education group is trying to
convince President Bush that he can bring about dramatic school
improvements with little or no extra spending if he adopts its
prescriptions for change.
   ``First, go for quality. Second, reward success in producing
quality. Third ... let the people on the firing line figure out how
to get the job done and get rid of as much of the bureacracy ... as
possible,'' says the blueprint released Thursday by the National
Center on Education and the Economy.
   The report calls on Bush to set ambitious national math and
science performance goals that match or exceed those of students
anywhere in the world.
   It also recommends letting some school districts use federal
money more freely, waiving the usual red tape and regulations in
favor of innovative local plans for as long as students continue to
progress. The successful projects would serve as models to reform
basic federal programs later on.
   New emphasis and cooperation among all levels of government in
the areas of day care, early childhood education and workforce
literacy are also envisioned in the report, called ``To Secure Our
Future: The Federal Role in Education.''
   Apple Computer Chairman John Sculley, chairman of the center
board, said the report has been presented to Bush, White House chief
of staff John Sununu and education secretary Lauro Cavazos.
   Speaking by telephone hookup to a news conference, Sculley said
he did not know whether any of the proposals would be included in an
omnibus education bill now being drafted at the White House.
   But Sculley said Bush was ``extremely interested in what we had
to say'' when he was given a draft last December. ``We do believe we
have the president's ear in terms of how important it is for him to
come out early in his term for massive education reform.''
   The report comes three years after the center, then known as the
Carnegie Forum on Education and Economy, released a highly respected
plan to upgrade the teaching profession. Among the members of its
high-powered board are former North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, former
labor secretary Ray Marshall and pollster Lou Harris. The honorary
chairman is New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   The two major teacher unions responded positively to the group's
latest effort.
   ``While respecting the need for certain regulations, the report
suggests we unhandcuff the system for greater creativity,'' said
Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers.
   Mary Futrell, president of the National Education Association,
said the report correctly stresses the need for federal
encouragement of restructuring.
   ``We also agree that proposed changes in distribution of federal
monies and programs must first be thoroughly tested, on an
experimental pilot basis, before existing regulatory and legislative
processes are modified,'' she said.
   The cornerstone of the report is its proposal to let school
districts design initiatives to improve student performance, ease
the transition from school to work for potential dropouts, and
coordinate social services for disadvantaged students. The money
would come from existing programs in the Labor, Education, Justice
and Health and Human Services departments.
   Local communities, if their proposals were approved by the state
and federal governments, ``would be free to combine the available
state and federal funds as they wish. ... They would continue to be
free of the prevailing rules and regulations as long as they were
meeting the (performance) targets they had set.''
   The other major recommendations:
   _Bush should ``identify the best (math and science) performance
anywhere in the world and resolve as a nation to meet it or beat
it,'' said center president Marc Tucker. The report suggests several
strategies, including a revamped curriculum and a national center to
teach teachers technology.
   _State, federal and local agencies should combine resources for
high-quality full-time day care, preschool child development centers
and before and after school care programs. Poor kids should not be
permitted to enter kindergarten ``as damaged goods, already marked
for failure.''
   _The country must stop treating adult illiteracy as a personal
misfortune ``rather than the threat to the nation's standard of
living that it really is.'' The problem can't be solved by
volunteers, nor can employers be expected to foot the whole bill.

   Soviet treatment of human rights probably
will never be tested before the World Court and Moscow's willingness
to obey court rulings carries more symbolism than substance, U.N.
and State Department legal experts say.
   Pieter Kooijmans, U.N. special investigator on human rights, said
Soviet acceptance of the court's authority in six major human rights
treaties ``is the shattering of a 40-year-old taboo.''
   Interviewed in Leiden, the Netherlands, Kooijmans added: ``It
would be a real breakthrough for human rights if the Soviet Union
would recognize the right of individuals'' to file complaints of
rights abuses.
   The World Court does not hear complaints from individuals, only
governments.
   A State Department legal expert noted that the World Court has
never handled a human rights dispute and said privately that the
Soviet acceptance of jurisdiction ``may amount to nothing more than
a meaningless gesture.
   ``It would be unlikely that a human rights dispute would ever
wind its way to the World Court,'' he said.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Thursday that the
United States welcomes ``any step in the submission of disputes of
this kind to binding decisions by neutral bodies such as the
International Court of Justice,'' the court's formal name.
   The Soviet Union had ratified the six treaties and pledged to
honor them but withheld recognition of the authority of the World
Court to judge its compliance.
   On Wednesday, Moscow announced it would accept the court's
jurisdiction in the human rights treaties, putting into practice a
policy President Mikhail S. Gorbachev advocated in December before
the General Assembly.
   The Soviets agreed to the court's authority on treaties
condemning genocide, banning slavery, guaranteeing political rights
for women, prohibiting racism and outlawing torture.
   Gorbachev also has spoken recently in favor of a larger U.N. role
in such international areas as arms control and space exploration,
traditionally the domain of the Soviet Union and United States.
   The Soviet acceptance of the court's authority will aid the
Soviet campaign to hold a human rights conference in Moscow in 1991
as one of several follow-up meetings to the 1975 Helsinki agreements
on European security and cooperation.
   In January, Washington changed its position and said it would
accept a Moscow conference, citing the Soviet release of political
prisoners, the easing of emigration and more tolerant views on free
speech and freedom of religion.
   Only governments can take cases before the court, which has 15
judges and sits in The Hague in the Netherlands. It has no authority
to deal with complaints of individuals or private organizations.
   Under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, individual citizens can complain of
rights abuses to an international body of legal experts with the
power to order compensation. Hungary ratified the protocol last year.
   The United States has ratified only one of the six human rights
treaties. The Soviets have accepted all six.
   Last year, the Senate finally ratified the 1948 Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, but it rejected
World Court authority over its interpretation. The United States has
signed the five other treaties but the Senate has not ratified them.
   ``We have accepted (World Court) jurisdiction over many more
treaties than the Soviet Union has, bilateral and multilateral,''
the State Department legal expert said.
   The United States rejects World Court's jurisdiction in national
security cases. In 1986, Nicaragua asked the court to rule on the
mining of its harbors and covert U.S. support for Contra rebels. The
court ruled in Nicaragua's favor but the United States, which did
not participate in the case, refused to accept the decision.

   The 45-day deadline that President Bush gave
Congress for enacting his $90 billion savings and loan rescue
package is slipping _ and by months rather than days.
   Despite losses mounting at an estimated $33 million a day, it has
been more than a month since Bush asked for action by April 1 and
none of the appropriate congressional committees has even begun
writing a bill.
   While the administration outlined the basic aspects of Bush's
proposals just prior to his budget address Feb. 9, the details were
not delivered to Congress until two weeks later.
   Both the House and Senate banking committees, which have the
primary jurisdiction, are not scheduled to begin drafting
legislation until after Congress returns April 3 from an Easter
recess.
   But because Bush's package calls for taxpayers to pick up $50
billion of the tab _ at an estimated cost four to six times that
amount over the next 30 years since the money will be borrowed _ at
least half a dozen other committees are demanding a say once the
banking panels are through.
   The tax-writing House Ways and Means and Senate Finance
committees are both claiming jurisdiction and the right to amend
whatever the banking committees do, as are the appropriations and
budget committees on both sides of Capitol Hill.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., a member of the Senate Banking
Committee, said Thursday that a bill ready for final action by
Congress will not be ready until June at the earliest.
   Asked if August might be a more reachable target, Cranston said,
``My hope is that it will be before then but you never know.''
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich., wants to have
a draft bill ready by March 23 when Congress recesses for Easter so
that members can review it over the holiday.
   He recalled that it took Congress a full year to write
legislation for the $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees to bail
out the Chrysler Corp. in 1980. He added that the financial
complexities of the Chrysler package were far fewer than those in
Bush's far bigger S&amp;L plan.
   Unlike Chrysler, which repaid all the money once it became
profitable again, no one expects the government to ever regain the
billions of dollars Bush is asking taxpayers to shell out for
depositors who sought federally guaranteed high interest rates at
deregulated and now insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   Riegle and other Democrats have criticized Bush's proposed
creation of a new government corporation to issue 30-year bonds for
financing the taxpayer portion of the bailout as a way of preventing
the costs from showing up in the federal deficit.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated Thursday that the
fiscal 1990 budget deficit will be $40 billion higher than the $91.1
billion predicted by the administration, attributing $22 billion of
the difference to the cost of the S&amp;L rescues.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing Ways
and Means Committee, said Thursday he expects whatever legislation
is written by the House Banking Committee to be referred to his
panel for amendment.
   ``I do not intend to delay or otherwise hamper the passage of
this important legislation,'' he said, adding that his committee
will only delve into the revenue and federal debt aspects of the
package.
   ``Only in this way can the Congress be assured that the American
taxpayer will have a full understanding of the total costs of the
savings and loan assistance program,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. took control of
another 45 failed savings and loans with $13.6 billion in assets in
eight states Thursday.
   That brings to 118 in 24 states the total number of institutions
that the agency has taken control of since Bush announced his S&amp;L
rescue package in early February.
   Bush instructed the FDIC, which regulates commercial banks, to
take over the sickest S&amp;Ls with the idea of minimizing their losses
while the institutions await rescue or closure. The agency plans to
take control of about another 100 institutions within the next month.

   A sunny, mild winter with no rain has
inspired Italian designers to rethink their cold-weather wardrobes.
   For the fall-winter ready to wear collections, which ended here
Thursday, there are practically none of the usual rainccats, heavy
shearlings and sumptuous furs that usually mark the coming of winter
Italian style.
   Instead, designers played heavily on lighter wool coats, capes,
shawls and every possible shape of jacket from the blazer to the
blouson.
   Fake furs, and fur look-a-like fabrics served the double purpose
of placating conservationists, and offering cheaper, cooler
alternatives to the traditional wraps.
   The biggest champion for the ecological cause was Milan's
``numero uno'' Giorgio Armani, who showed stoles, jackets and even
floor length coats in synthetic substitutes of leopard, tiger,
panther among others. As the fake furs were paraded down the runway
a voice speaking for the animal world announced, ``thank you Armani
for saving our skins.''
   Fendi, famous for their extravagant furs also nodded in the
direction of the conservationists with a collection of inside out
furs. The leather side of pelts from sable to skunk is in fact
treated to look like polished cotton, so that the coat stripped of
its lining is reversible.
   The new Milanese coat is very big, soft and cozy with ample
dropped sleeve, and wide shawl collar. Sometimes it is belted at the
waist, at others it flows freely to the ankle.
   After several seasons where the skirt dominated the fashion scene
from the daring 1980's minis skirt, to the feminine mid calf-length
alternative, pants are firmly back on the Milan runway. Often
man-tailored and cuffed, they also come super-wide especially for
evening, or as skin-fitting as tights.
   At the beginning of a new decade the Milanese designers have
opted to to let women make their own fashion decisions in color and
style. Thus there is not one strong message for next season but a
lot of fashionable suggestions, from Gianfranco Ferre's dramatic
silhouette, of stiff-collared, gold cuff-linked white silk blouse
draped with a lavish fox scarf, and worn over simple gray flannel
pants, to Giorgio Armani's tailored art student look, to Byblos'
leisurely weekend collection.
   As to the color scheme there were the usual staple black and
white, and Milan smog shades. Fall shades were also popular, with
aubergine or eggplant and mustard the newest hues. For those who
want a more cheerful winter the designers also offered lots of
bright blue, yellow and tangerine, along with festive red.
   Hairstyles for next winter are generally longer than in recent
seasons, with some designers calling for a return to the wild and
wooly looks of the 1960's.
   There is, however, one point on which all the Milanese designers
insist. High heels even for evening are no longer chic. Instead
fashionable women will warm their winter feet in elf-like suede
booties.

<HEAD>House Bill Creating Eastern Strike Study Panel Advances</HEAD>

   Democrats say legislation awaiting House
approval would edge Eastern Airlines and its striking machinists a
step closer to labor peace _ one way or another _ but Republicans
are scoffing at the bill's value.
   On a voice vote, the House Public Works Committee on Thursday
sent a measure to the full House that would force President Bush to
name an emergency board to recommend a way to end the 7-day-old work
stoppage. Passage by the Democratic-controlled chamber is expected
next week.
   Bush opposes such a step, arguing that direct talks between the
ailing carrier and the striking International Association of
Machinists are the only way to end the 17-month-old impasse. Eastern
sought protection from its creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New
York on Thursday.
   Even though the union-sought bill faces an uncertain fate in the
Senate _ and the likelihood of a Bush veto _ Democrats say the
measure focuses public attention on the walkout, puts pressure on
the two sides to reach an agreement and might even produce a formula
that would end the dispute.
   Some of them also say it could embarrass the president into
taking action.
   ``It focuses a very bright light on inexcusable presidential
inaction,'' said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., who is active on labor
issues for the House Dmocratic leadership.
   The board's suggested solution would be only a recommendation,
but lawmakers say it could ultimately be imposed on the airline and
its workers in later, separate legislation.
   ``If they don't accept it, Congress can act on it and I would
have no hesitation on bringing an offer to the committee,'' Rep.
James Oberstar, D-Minn., chairman of the Public Works aviation
subcommittee, told the committee before the vote.
   Republicans, however, said they believe the bill has little
chance of becoming law. Even if it does, they said, the board would
do little to bridge the animosity that has been festering between
the two sides for years.
   ``This is mainly political window-dressing to make it look like
Congress is doing something,'' Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark.,
ranking Republican on the panel, told reporters after the vote. ``It
accomplishes absolutely nothing.''
   The bill also would provide for a cooling-off period of up to 26
days while the special board studies the dispute. During that time,
rehired workers would receive their pre-strike salaries, while
employees who are laid off would be entitled to unemployment
benefits.
   An earlier version of the bill would have allowed a cooling-off
period of up to 60 days. But the panel shortened the time frame,
heeding Eastern's arguments that it lacks enough cash to survive a
two-month delay.
   The basic dispute, which is over wages and benefits, is between
Eastern and the 8,500-member International Association of
Machinists, but most of the carrier's pilots and flight attendants
have refused to cross picket lines.
   The measure would require the emergency board to recommend
solutions to contract disputes between Eastern and its pilots' and
flight attendants' unions, which both have expired contracts.
   The measure's fate is uncertain in the Senate, where a solitary
opponent can often use procedural delays to kill legislation. Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Wednesday he would ``oppose any effort''
to pass the bill.

   The Pentagon faces paralysis even if George
Bush quickly finds a replacement nominee for John Tower as defense
secretary, officials say.
   Some of the officials argue President Bush will have to elevate
the authority of Acting Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV, a
Reagan holdover, or the department's attempt to project a
business-as-usual posture will crumble.
   ``The routine stuff is getting done, thanks to Will Taft,'' said
one official. ``But we're running out of time, now. You can't just
focus on the routine stuff.''
   Said another senior official, who is also a Reagan holdover,
``We're getting close to the deadline for budget decisions over
here.''
   That same official said it would take several weeks before a
replacement for Tower can be installed at the Pentagon.
   The Senate voted 53-47 Thursday to reject Tower's nomination
after questions were raised about his alleged alcohol abuse,
indiscreet behavior toward women and ties to defense contractors.
   In the meantime, say Pentagon officials, the Pentagon's internal
budget deliberations are coming to a head and that the department
will have to submit a plan to the White House by the end of the
month for slashing almost $6.4 billion from its fiscal 1990 request.
   What worries some officials even more is that without a secretary
of defense, the selection and confirmation of key deputies
throughout the department remains at an absolute standstill.
   Bush has submitted only one other Pentagon nomination _ that of
former GM executive Donald J. Atwood to become deputy defense
secretary _ to the Senate. But that nomination now likely goes on
hold pending selection of a new defense chief, and the dozens of
under secretaries and assistant secretaries that help run the
department are still not on board, the officials said.
   ``We don't have any kind of new team in the top bureucratic
positions,'' said one source. ``And that means months of delays down
the road in having people geared up to deal with budget and policy
matters.''
   Moreover, the Pentagon has missed congressional deadlines for
three reports on important military issues and does not have a
secretary representing it during a special 90-day strategic military
policy review ordered by Bush.
   ``We're still in the staff-work phase of that review but if you
don't have a secretary by April, then you begin to have problems,''
said one official.
   ``The administration is talking about deciding things like the
shape of our nuclear arsenal and there's no secretary of defense,''
said another source. ``At least Tower had been working on that,
pending confirmation.''

<HEAD>Two Indian Museums Would Cost More than $150 Million, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Building a new Indian museum in Washington and
moving the existing one in New York City will cost more than $100
million, not to mention annual operating costs of about $25 million
a year, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution told a
congressional panel.
   ``We are in the process of developing detailed cost estimates for
this undertaking but recognize already that they will not be
inconsequential,'' Secretary Robert Adams told the House Interior
Committee.
   Adams appeared with representatives of the Museum of the American
Indian and the city and state of New York to detail a tentative
agreement reached in January transferring ownership of the Heye
Foundation's collection of Indian artifacts to the Smithsonian.
   The pact, which must be approved by the Smithsonian's executive
board and New York state courts, would solve the problem of
preserving the collection of 1 million artifacts, a fraction of
which are on display in the New York museum. Most are stored in a
Bronx warehouse.
   Adams also estimated one-time costs ``in the tens of millions of
dollars'' for taking over the collection of the Museum of the
American Indian and building additional storage space at the
Smithsonian's Museum Support Center in Suitland, Md.
   ``These costs, of course, must be weighed in the light of an
extraordinary opportunity _ indeed, an obligation _ to preserve a
collection of monumental significance, make it more accessible to
the public than it ever has been, and to share it fully with those
whose ancestors created the obejcts within it,'' Adams said.

<HEAD>Kassebaum Only GOP Senator to Break Ranks on Tower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE GOULD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the moment came, Nancy Landon Kassebaum
sat alone at her desk on the crowded, silent floor of the United
States Senate.
   When her name was called, she rose, alone among her Republican
colleagues, and said what none of them had said or would say about
the nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense.
   ``No,'' said Kassebaum, with nearly all of the 100 senators
sitting quietly in their armchairs, listening as she became the only
Republican senator to join Democrats in defeating Tower's nomination.
   It was the latest display of independence by the junior senator
from Kansas, who serves her state with Bob Dole, the senior senator,
Republican leader and prime fighter on behalf of Tower.
   Kassebaum is independent, yet loyal.
   Had her vote been needed, she said, she would have swallowed her
objections to Tower and voted for his confirmation. As she later
explained to reporters: ``I would not have wanted to be the
defeating vote ... if it was that important to the president.''
   Twice before in recent years the 56-year-old Kassebaum has broken
ranks with her party on hot, highly-partisan issues.
   ``It's very tough when you go against the president of your own
party and against my senior senator, who is the Republican leader.
But I really didn't have a lot of arm-twisting,'' she said.
   ``I think people, whether they were disappointed or not, and I'm
sure some were, respected the independent judgment that you bring to
bear on these issues,'' Kassebaum added.
   Such was the case twice in 1986 _ in the summer when she voted
against the nomination of Dan Manion to be a federal judge, and in
the fall when she voted with Democrats to override President
Reagan's veto of limited economic sanctions against South Africa.
   In the Manion case, she also showed party loyalty while
dissenting. Told during the roll call that a fellow Republican who
wanted to vote in favor of Manion couldn't be located, she agreed to
``pair'' her vote with the missing senator, in effect canceling out
each other's vote.
   Kassebaum, who served as head of a congressional Military Reform
Caucus, said her chief concerns about Tower involved his work for
defense contractors.
   ``The next secretary of defense is going to have to counter the
debilitating impact that the defense procurement scandal has had on
public confidence in our defense establishment,'' she said.
   She said did not believe that Tower could ``provide the
leadership that is necessary to forge a consensus on the critical
national security issues confronting us today.''
   One of only two women serving in the Senate _ Democrat Barbara
Mikulski of Maryland is the other _ Kassebaum also took note of
Tower's alleged attitudes about and treatment of women.
   She noted a Pentagon study that found harassment and promotion
problems facing women in the military and said ``I am not confident
that Senator Tower would give these issues the priority they demand
or would demonstrate the necessary sensitivity to their
seriousness.''
   But Kassebaum made no mention of Tower's drinking habits, subject
of much of the week's debate.
   ``It was not immaterial,'' she said. But ``it's hard to judge
someone on moral standards.''
   Kassebaum, daughter of Alf Landon, the 1936 GOP presidential
nominee who was buried by a Roosevelt election landslide, said she
thought of her late father during the Tower debate.
   ``I couldn't help but think of my dad, who I'm sure would have
said, `Nancy, you should vote with the president.' He would have
felt strongly that way. But as with most who have an appreciation of
government, he would have respected the judgment I brought to bear.''
   The senator faces another judgment call in the not-too-distant
future.
   She came to the Senate in 1978, promising if elected to serve no
more than two terms. Her current one expires in 1990, and she is
under GOP pressure to run for another six-year term.
   At a meeting in Dole's office recently, President Bush posed for
pictures with Kassebaum. The president wore a campaign button
saying, ``Run, Nancy, Run!''

   Kitty Dukakis says she would have preferred to keep
her personal crisis and drinking problem private, but she now wants
to help others.
   ``My hope is that by being public, I might encourage others to
seek help through programs like the one I entered at Edgehill
Newport and the extraordinary fellowship of AA,'' she said Thursday,
adding that she is eager to go through the Alcoholics Anonymous
program.
   The wife of Gov. Michael Dukakis also said she had a drinking
problem long before encountering the stresses of her husband's
public life. ``I don't blame the (presidential) campaign for my
being an alcoholic,'' she said.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, spoke at a news conference two days after
completing a monthlong rehabilitation program in Rhode Island.
   She said her drinking became a serious problem in the three
``terribly painful and lonely'' months after her husband's defeat.
   ``Any crisis could have led to the drinking,'' she said. ``The
campaign was a very positive experience. The only problem is that we
lost.''
   Accompanying Mrs. Dukakis were her husband and her father, Harry
Ellis Dickson, retired associate conductor of the Boston Pops.

   Thousands of Barbadians cheered
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, who addressed the Senate in a ceremony
marking the 350th anniversary of this eastern Caribbean island's
parliament.
   ``Any nation which can boast of the continuous existence of their
parliament for 350 years has sure grounds for pride,'' she said
Thursday at a joint session of the House of Assembly and Senate.
   Crowds gathered in Bridgetown's Trafalgar Square, adjacent to the
parliament buildings, and applauded Elizabeth and her husband,
Prince Philip, as they stepped out of their limousine and entered
the Senate.
   She said that the ``small band of expatriate Englishmen'' who
established Barbados' House of Assembly in 1639 ``believed that a a
self-governing system formed according to the principles of
individual liberty would bring more order and comfort to their lives
in an unfamiliar environment.''

   Columnist and TV commentator George F. Will
has resigned as a University of Maryland regent under pressure, but
Gov. William Donald Schaefer said he isn't ready to accept Will's
departure.
   Schaefer said he will decide whether to ask Will to remain on the
Board of Regents after he talks to board Chairman Peter O'Malley.
   The Evening Sun of Baltimore has reported that Will attended none
of the seven regents' meetings since he was appointed last July and
has not attended subcommittee meetings.
   ``I think he thought he was under pressure from the press and
others as to why he didn't attend,'' the governor said.
   But he said Will made it clear when he agreed to accept the
appointment last summer that he would miss many meetings because of
his busy schedule. Will writes a syndicated newspaper column and is
a comentator for ABC-TV.
   Will resigned March 2, saying the demands of his profession were
``incompatible'' with service on the board. But Schaefer said he is
nonetheless a valuable addition to the Board of Regents because of
his prestige.
   ``He knows everybody,'' the governor said. ``He interviews with
the greatest. To me he was just a good person to have as a member of
the Board of Regents even though he couldn't come to all the
meetings. I put him on with that understanding.''

   South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu is
running for the Harvard Board of Overseers to push for the
university's total divestment from companies doing business in his
homeland.
   ``Harvard is a great leader in world education. The time has come
for Harvard to become a moral leader as well in the worldwide
struggle against apartheid,'' Tutu said Thursday in a prepared
statement.
   ``With her help, and the help of men and women of good will
throughout the world, we shall one day soon transform my beautiful
and troubled land into a genuinely democratic, non-racial society,''
Tutu said.
   The archbishop's candidacy was announced at the University of the
Western Cape in Cape Town, South Africa, said his spokesman John
Allen. News conferences also were held in Harvard and in Bogota.
   The Harvard Alumni Association has announced 10 candidates for
the five positions open, making a total of 15 candidates. Results of
the election, voted on by the 160,000 alumni worldwide, will be
announced June 8.

<HEAD>Brazil Expected to Cause Boost in Worldwide Oilseed Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New estimates by the Agriculture Department
suggest that American soybean farmers will continue to hear the
approaching samba sound of Brazilian footsteps in the world oilseed
market.
   Not that South American production is taking over the soybean
lead enjoyed by the United States for many years, but world trade _
and domestic prices _ are sensitive to the slightest movement in
production and demand.
   The USDA said Thursday that improved prospects for soybeans in
Brazil have helped boost the forecast slightly for 1988-89 global
oilseed production to 198.6 million metric tons.
   Officials said the total increased less than 1 percent from
indications last month and still was 4 percent below last year's
record.
   Soybeans, forecast at 93.4 million tons, accounted for most of
the increase from February. The U.S. share of world output was 41.9
million tons.
   In 1987-88, when world soybean output was 103.2 million tons, the
U.S. harvest was 52.3 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of soybeans or wheat, or 39.7 bushels of corn.
   ``Brazil's crop estimate was raised by 1 million tons to 21
million tons, reflecting larger area indications and highly
favorable growing conditions over the past month,'' the report said.
   At 21 million tons, the crop would be a record for Brazil and
about 11 percent more than the harvest of 18 million tons in 1987-88.
   Brazil and Argentina are the leading foreign competitors of U.S.
farmers in the world soybean market. Along with other Southern
Hemisphere countries, they are watched closely for signs of changes
in soybean and grain production patterns.
   For example, the improved outlook for Brazil's soybeans has been
an important factor this week in commodity futures trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade, along with weather conditions that could
affect spring planting kin the United States.
   ``Argentina's soybean prospects deteriorated further in February,
although the improvement in moisture and temperature trends late in
the month probably aided soybeans,'' the report said.
   The forecast for Argentina soybeans was reduced by 500,000 tons
to 8.5 million tons in 1988-89, compared with 9.9 million tons last
season.
   Looking at grain, the report said global prospects for 1988-89
``are little changed from last month. Argentina's new corn crop
continued to deteriorate, but South Africa's crop showed further
improvement.''
   World grain trade for 1988-89 was forecast to be up slightly from
February indications, with larger imports expected for China and the
Soviet Union. The U.S. grain supply and use estimates were largely
unchanged.

   The Agriculture Department has scrapped a plan
which would have held farmers and others in the marketing chain
financially accountable for selling livestock found to contain
illegally high traces of drugs at time of slaughter.
   The ``bill-back'' proposal was announced May 24, 1988, and was
subjected to public review during formal rulemaking procedure.
Nearly 300 comments were received.
   B.H. ``Bill'' Jones, administrator of the department's Packers
and Stockyards Administration, said Thursday the bill-back plan was
designed to shift economic responsibility for violative drug
residues from the meat packer to the person causing the violation.
   The proposal involved illegally high residues of sulfa and
antibiotic drugs found in carcasses of young calves, culled dairy
cows and swine.
   Jones said 87 percent of the comments opposed the concept of
bill-back, with most questioning the ability to trace and accurately
identify the source of the illegal drug residues.
   Although the proposal has been withdrawn, Jones said that would
not preclude anyone suffering financial hardship because of an
illegal drug residue from seeking restitution.
   Buyers are entitled to know the identity of the seller, including
a consignor, when an animal carcass is condemned as a result of a
drug violation, he said.

<HEAD>Iron Deficiency in Children May Raise Risk of Developmental Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young children with iron-poor diets may risk
problems in mental and physical performance that will continue as
they enter school, a researcher says.
   New research findings underline the importance of preventing iron
deficiencies from birth, said Betsy Lozoff of the Case Western
Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland.
   A study of 191 outwardly healthy one-year-olds in Costa Rica
found that those with anemia caused by iron deficiency scored lower
than other children in mental and physical performance.
   Preliminary results of a follow-up study suggest the score
deficits persisted in those children through age 5, even though the
anemia had long since been corrected, Lozoff said Thursday.
   The children scored within normal ranges for mental and physical
abilities, but the deficits might be enough to affect performance in
school, Lozoff said.
   Speaking at a symposium on nutrition, children and health
sponsored by the New York Academy of Medicine and the New York State
Department of Health, she cautioned that the study does not prove
iron deficiencies cause the poor scores.
   Myron Winick, a professor of nutrition and pediatrics at the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York,
agreed with that caution. Perhaps other circumstances that tend to
occur in homes of children with iron deficiencies are really
responsible, he said.
   In any case, iron deficiencies in young children can be prevented
by breast feeding, using iron-fortified formula and cereal, and
keeping iron in mind when solid foods are introduced, Lozoff said.
   Among American children, such steps have cut the prevalence of
iron-deficiency anemia from about 25 percent of infants to about 3
percent to 8 percent, Lozoff said.
   In the Costa Rican study, anemic one-year-olds showed deficits in
both mental measures and in performance on such tasks as walking by
themselves, climbing stairs and walking along a board.
   Results of efforts to eliminate such deficits by correcting the
anemia have been discouraging, raising the question of whether the
iron deficiency is truly to blame, Lozoff said.
   Researchers have also found that if very young rats are given too
little iron, a deficiency of the mineral in their brains will
persist into adulthood, even if the iron-poor diet is corrected in
later life, she said.
   Such studies have not been done in humans because they require
removing brain tissue, Lozoff said.

<HEAD>Darman's Private Stance on Taxes Questioned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget talks between the White House and
Congress are off to a less-than-smooth start, as early political
squabbling dampened otherwise optimistic talk.
   President Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, and Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady met with the Democratic chairmen and senior
Republicans from the House and Senate budget committees Thursday
afternoon to launch an initial two-week search for agreement.
   The participants said they hoped to draw a map on how to reach
compromise on a fiscal 1990 budget, although they might not reach
that destination themselves.
   Their goal, they said, is a general plan to balance competing
interests of defense and domestic programs, taxes, and reducing the
deficit, but without the detail of a congressional budget resolution.
   Darman characterized the first meeting as deciding on a
``framework for analysis,'' and the talks broke off until next
Tuesday so that budget technicians could put things in order for
``getting down to the hard part.''
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said the discussions would not necessarily be limited to
fiscal 1990. Bush has proposed a $1.16 trillion spending plan for
the year beginning Oct. 1.
   The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.,
told reporters before Thursday's meeting that he saw the White House
agenda as adopting ``a minimalist approach'' this year and then
opening the door to tax increases later.
   Sasser, who repeatedly has said that a tax boost was needed to
reduce the deficit, told reporters that Darman was privately
agreeing with him.
   Darman, however, denied he had strayed even privately from
President Bush's promise of no new taxes, and said he hoped the
talks would produce a strong deficit-reduction plan.
   ``I can't imagine he would have said that,'' Darman said. Asked
whether he was more favorable to a tax increase than his public
statements have indicated, Darman said, ``Maybe that's what he would
like to believe.''
   The White House contends enacting its budget would reduce the
deficit below the $100 billion target of the Gramm-Rudman law.
   A report by the Congressional Budget Office, released Thursday,
estimated the deficit at $131 billion, $40 billion higher than the
administration projection. Most of the difference was due to an
accounting difference over Bush's plan to bail out the savings and
loan industry.

   James A. Van Allen, the U.S. space
researcher who discovered the Earth's high-energy radiation belts
named for him, has won the $252,000 Crafoord prize of Sweden's Royal
Academy of Sciences.
   The academy, which also awards the Nobel prizes, cited work by
Van Allen which gave the United States the edge at the start of the
space race with the Soviet Union.
   Van Allen, 74, developed new rockets and space instruments used
in launching the first U.S. satellites, the academy said Thursday.
   ``He played an important role in the space race,'' said academy
member Rolf Bostrom. ``He has been kind of a father for experimental
physics in space research.''
   Van Allen, however, never advocated sending men into space,
believing instead that greater scientific benefit could be drawn
from unmanned flights through their instruments.
   The prestigious Crafoord prize, worth $252,000, has been awarded
since 1982. It will be given to Van Allen at a ceremony in September
by Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Urge Drug Czar to Resist Congressional Hearings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug policy director William J. Bennett needs
to ``just say no'' to overeager lawmakers who might make him
squander time in endless hearings, senators said after confirming
the former education secretary in his new post.
   ``I have pledged to Dr. Bennett that the Judiciary Committee will
not call him up to testify in the next six months, as long as he
follows the statute's requirement,'' Judiciary Chairman Joseph
Biden, D-Del., said Thursday as the Senate voted 97-2 for
confirmation.
   Biden urged other lawmakers to do the same, saying the last thing
Bennett needs as the nation's new ``drug czar'' is to shuttle back
and forth to Capitol Hill to field questions.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said congressional procedures must be
streamlined to remove the temptation to summon Bennett for
``seven-camera hearings'' on the drug issue, always a convenient way
to seize the limelight.
   Bennett's confirmation was smooth, even though sparks at times
flew over his strongly worded views as President Reagan's secretary
of education.
   Only Sens. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., voted
against the nominee while Sen. John Warner, R-Va., did not vote.
   Simon, a longtime ally of teacher groups, said he feared that
Bennett would produce ``a blizzard of press releases but not much
action.''
   He was the lone dissenter hours earlier when the Judiciary
Committee voted 13-1 to send the nomination to the floor. He said
Bennett had sought a cut in the Education Department's drug
education budget and ``was not strong'' as an administrator.
   Bennett's new post gives him 180 days to draft a strategy for
fighting the drug war and requires him to study the spending plans
of Cabinet officers and prod them to increase outlays for narcotics
control if he deems it necessary. The president becomes the referee
if the two officials cannot agree.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said Thursday that Bennett ``has a
difficult job (but) it shouldn't be considered mission impossible.''
   Biden told lawmakers the real issue was ``whether President Bush
has a strategy, whether he is going to enunciate that strategy and
whether he is going to put that strategy into effect.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the top Republican on the
committee, replied there was no question that Bush was focusing hard
on the drug problem.
   ``I have been in the White House several times recently and I
assure you that he is vitally interested,'' Thurmond said.
   Biden said he believed Bush was interested but it remained to be
seen if that would be ``matched by overwhelming commitment of
resources and action.''

<HEAD>Quality Control Lacking in US Grain Exports, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American system of handling grain exports
has so many problems with quality control that the United States
could lose its leading role in the world market, says a report
requested by Congress.
   The report, released Thursday by the Office of Technology
Assessment, said U.S. policy on grain lacks even have one definition
of quality.
   ``In grain, the word quality has a variety of meanings _ being
free of foreign material, not cracked or spoiled or having the
proper characteristic for a particular use,'' the report said.
   The problems with American grain have led to an increase in
foreign complaints, the report said.
   ``In the 1970s, one-third of the world's countries supplied grain
to two-thirds of the world; today the reverse is true,'' the report
said. ``This highly competitive environment has made foreign buyers
increasingly sensitive about the quality of grain they import.''
   The report was prepared at the request of the House Committee on
Agriculture and the Joint Economic Committee.
   At a news conference on the report, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.,
said he did not agree with everything it in, but that it was
important in determining how the United States can improve its
competitive edge.
   ``It's a starting point for further debate,'' he said.
   Both he, and Sens. Thomas Daschle, D-N.D., and Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, mentioned that they were troubled by reports of cement chips
in U.S. grain that had been shipped to foreign ports.
   ``My farmers tell me their grain is clean when it is brought to
the elevator,'' said Daschle.
   Conrad said the Secretary of Agriculture has been asked to
investigate further.
   Michael Phillips, who headed the OTA study, said the problem is
with the whole system of marketing grain to foreign countries.
   Compared with other grain-exporting countries, the U.S. system is
more complex, Phillips said.
   He said other countries address the quality problems as part of
an integrated agricultural policy, with more controls at the first
point of sale.
   Most other exporters clean grain at the first point of receipt,
while no economic incentive to do so exists in the United States, he
said.
   He also said foreign buyers complain about the way the United
States blends a wide range of different quality grains in an attempt
to create a uniform product, but this causes differences in
shipments.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said enhancing grain quality must
begin with the design of commodity programs, research at
universities and seed breeders on new grain varieties, and the
standardization of testing procedures.
   Phillips said, however, the United States still has many
advantages over its biggest competitors: Argentina, Brazil, Canada
and Australia.
   ``We can meet almost any demand,'' he said. ``We can produce any
type of grain a buyer wants. We can supply it at any time of the
year and we can move it from terminal to overseas buyer faster thany
anyone else.''

   Warrant Officer James W. Hall III, 30, of Sharon Springs, N.Y.,
was sentenced Thursday night in a military courtroom at Fort McNair
in southwest Washington. Three days earlier he had pleaded guilty to
10 counts of espionage, attempted espionage and violating Army
regulations.
   Col. Howard C. Eggers, the military judge who presided at the
court-martial, also gave Hall a dishonorable discharge and ordered
him to forfeit all future pay and allowances.
   Hall, who will be eligible for parole after serving a minimum of
10 years, was facing the prospect of a death sentence before he
entered into a pre-trial agreement with the government that set his
maximum punishment at 45 years confinment.
   Eggers was not allowed to see the punishment agreement before
passing sentence.
   Army prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed during the
court-martial that Hall had received payments totaling $100,000 to
$200,000 between 1983 and 1988, when he admitted passing classified
information to representatives of East Germany and the Soviet Union.
The annual $30,000 retainer from East Germany was in effect part of
that five-year period.
   Col. David Armitage, chief of the Army's forensic psychiatry
division at Walter Reed Army Hospital, testified Thursday that his
examinations of Hall suggested that Hall was motivated primarily by
money.
   Most of the government's case against Hall, including the details
of his espionage activities, was outlined for Eggers during closed
sessions of the court-martial that were conducted in a secured
courtroom.
   Hall, an intelligence analyst with a top-secret security
clearance, was arrested Dec. 21 near Savannah, Ga., and accused of
delivering film and documents dealing with communications
intelligence and war plans to Warsaw Pact nations.
   At the time of his arrest, Hall was assigned to the 24th Infantry
Division and worked as an intelligence analyst at the Army's G-2
intelligence section. He joined the Army in 1976 and spent most of
his career in Europe working as an analyst of intercepted radio and
telephone traffic and coded messages.
   Before leaving Europe to return to the United States in 1987,
according to testimony, Hall received a medal and a $5,000 bonus
from the East German government.
   After his arrest, Hall began cooperating with military
authorities. The pre-trial agreement required that he submit to
``unlimited debriefings'' and polygraph examinations about his spy
activities.
   He also agreed to testify, if called, against Huseyin Yildirim, a
Turkish-born naturalized citizen to whom Hall allegedly passed the
intelligence information.
   Yildirim, 60, was arrested at his home is Belleair Beach, Fla.,
last December and charged with conspiracy to commit espionage. If
convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.

<HEAD>Refugees Say Trip To United States Too Costly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   For Etelvina Ticas, the road to the
promised land was paved with open palms and demands for payoffs. As
she traveled north to the United States, the question was always the
same.
   ``Do you want to go further? Then hand over money,'' the young
Salvadoran refugee said, crying a bit as she cuddled her 5-year-old
daughter.
   Central Americans such as Ms. Ticas _ refugees fleeing embattled
homelands _ say much of what they saved for their long, dangerous
trip north was slowly sapped by an assortment of smugglers, bus
drivers and corrupt officials.
   ``It happens at all the checkpoints there are,'' said a
27-year-old Honduran woman who gave her name only as Margarita.
``They ask for papers on the bus and the ones who don't have papers
they tell to give them money.''
   Beginning soon after they enter Mexico from Guatemala, the
Central Americans say, people who identify themselves as authorities
demand money to allow them to continue.
   Some also complained of robberies by people they said identified
themselves as police and of extortion by others, including bus
drivers.
   Spokesmen for the Attorney General's Office and the Interior
Department said they knew of no formal complaints of abuses by
people in their departments.
   Central Americans have been flooding north through Mexico, but
they no longer can legally enter the United States and apply for
political asylum without being detained.
   Many have searched for smugglers to help them across the Rio
Grande from this border town, but others say they have run out of
money.
   The refugees, many of them in Mexico illegally, gave only general
locations for checkpoints and were unfamiliar with the multiple
government agencies, making it unlikely they could file a complaint
even if they were willing to go to authorities.
   Ms. Ticas sat in a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas, as
she recalled the arduous, costly journey from eastern El Salvador
that ended with her detention this week shortly after entering the
United States.
   She said those who stopped the buses at about five different
points ``from when we entered Mexico until we left Mexico'' took a
total of between $215 and $260 in Mexican pesos, part of the $700
she had when she entered the country.
   At one stop, men were forced to strip to prove they weren't
hiding money, she said. She had to shake her clothes and jacket.
   She managed to hide a roll of bills but left behind a small
suitcase of clothing as part payment, she said.
   ``There are many scoundrels who commit abuses, who pass
themselves off as police officers,'' Rene Hernandez of the Attorney
General's Office said.
   Both he and Hector Rivera of the Interior Department's
immigration services office said Central Americans must file formal
complaints saying who demanded the money and where the incidents
occurred.
   They said they could refer to any of at least four different
police forces, as well as customs and immigration agents, all under
separate government departments.
   A few said they reached the border without having to pay, but
extortion was the first aspect of the trip mentioned by many and one
of the main reasons they gave for having little or no money left.
   Cirse Amador, 22, a Nicaraguan, said the routine is common among
authorities and others.
   ``They say, `You're not from here. If you want to get to Mexico
City you're going to have to give some dough,''' she said.
   She said about six people paid the bus driver $65, down from his
asking price of $86, to get them by the checkpoints.
   ``The bus drivers took my last $73,'' Luis Alonso Avalos, a
Salvadoran said. ``They said we had passed two checkpoints and that
was what it was worth.''

<TEXT>
   Warsaw Pact and NATO negotiators
emphasized their areas of agreement rather than their sharp
differences as they began new talks on cutting conventional weapons
and building mutual trust.
   The separate sets of talks opened Thursday in Vienna's majestic
Hofburg palace. The new arms negotiations replace 15 years of failed
talks also held here.
   The new sessions on reducing conventional weapons bring together
the 16 NATO countries and the seven Soviet-led Warsaw Pact nations.
The negotiations on closer East-West relations involve 35 nations,
including the Soviet Union and United States, that signed the 1975
Helsinki accords on human rights.
   The chief Soviet negotiator, Oleg Grinevsky, said the differences
between the sides were not insurmountable, and he held out hope of
an initial agreement by the early 1990s.
   Chief U.S. negotiator Steven J. Ledogar said the negotiations
were off to a good start but that NATO did not want to set a time
frame for possible agreements. ``We are not really that far apart,''
Ledogar said.
   Despite the optimistic words, arms reduction proposals presented
by each military bloc at the negotiations underlined the
differences, particularly over air and naval forces and tactical
nuclear weapons.
   Outlining the Warsaw Pact's stance on conventional arms,
Grinevsky proposed deep cuts by 1994 in troop numbers, tanks,
artillery and other land weapons and combat aircraft.
   He gave no numbers, but said both blocs should eliminate any
imbalances and then trim to 10 percent to 15 percent below their
present lowest levels.
   In a second phase, from 1994-97, both sides should trim troop
numbers by 25 percent, or about 500,000 men, he said. In a third
phase, by the year 2000, the alliances should move to strictly
defensive forces.
   By contrast, NATO wants specific overall ceilings. Under its
proposal, each side should be limited to 20,000 tanks, 16,5000
artillery pieces and 23,000 armored personnel carriers.
   NATO says the proposal would eliminate the danger of a surprise
attack and a 2-1 Warsaw Pact edge in those weapons.
   As outlined in a paper given to reporters, the Warsaw Pact
proposal at the closed-door negotiations made no specific mention of
tactical nuclear weapons.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze drew criticism
from the West on Monday for including nuclear rockets in proposals
for the talks, whose mandate specifically excludes the weapons.
   Western officials saw Shevardnadze's proposal as targeted at West
Germany, where there appears to be little political support for U.S.
efforts to modernize aging tactical nuclear weapons.
   Grinevsky said at a news conference that the East was ``seriously
concerned'' about such efforts.
   Nuclear weapons ``are not on the agenda, but they exist (all)
around us. It's impossible to close our eyes to that. I'm just
warning about that, nothing more,'' he said.
   He also said the West should not expect one-sided concessions in
light of unilateral troop and spending reductions already made by
the Warsaw Pact.
   ``Good will has its limits,'' Grinevsky said. ``Let none cherish
the hope that our profound internal changes will be making us more
malleable and agreeable to unreasonable demands or inflated bids.''

   The nation's immigration chief says he'll use
county jails and military facilities to detain Central American
refugees if they continue to stream across the Texas border, but a
House panel chairman says the policy is an ``impending disaster.''
   Alan C. Nelson, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, told a House panel Thursday that there's no
alternative to detaining the refugees while their claims for asylum
are processed, because they'll never be found if given freedom to
travel.
   ``It looks like an impending disaster,'' said Rep. Bruce A.
Morrison, chairman of the House Judiciary immigration subcommittee.
He said the INS detention facility at Port Isabel, Texas _ now with
1,700 refugees _ would soon reach its capacity of 5,000.
   The commissioner said the key to slowing down the stream of
immigrants depends on ``whether the word gets down the line'' that
``there's no free ride'' any more for those crossing the U.S. border
illegally.
   Nelson said the refugees, coming for economic reasons, are
abusing the asylum process by contending they meet the test of a
well-founded fear of persecution in their native countries.
   ``We have other detention facilities'' if the Port Isabel
facility is filled up, Nelson said, including arrangements with
county governments for use of their jails and for use of military
facilities.
   Morrison, D-Conn., and Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, also contended
that the crush of refugees has caused the Bush administration to
reverse the Reagan administration's policy of favoritism toward
asylum requests of Nicaraguans fleeing the communist Sandinista
government.
   ``Something extraordinary is going on,'' Morrison said, citing a
drastic decline in approvals for Nicaraguan asylum requests since
the latest influx of refugees began straining the resources of the
INS.
   Nelson insisted there's been ``no change'' in policy, asserting
that the Nicaraguans coming now were doing so for economic reasons,
while more of their predecessors came because of political
persecution.
   ``I've got to call them as I see them,'' Nelson said, contending
each case is reviewed on its own merits.
   But Morrison said he suspected a deliberate policy change because
asylum approvals for Nicaraguans dropped from 53 percent from
1983-88 to as low as 2 percent on one day sampled last month.
   ``I don't know there's a discrepancy,'' Nelson said to a round of
laughter in the hearing room.
   Bryant asked, ``Is everything okay in Nicaragua? Has the book
changed so you're saying things are not so bad?''
   Nelson and Paula Dobriansky, deputy assistant secretary of state
for human rights, assured the panel they still believed Nicaragua's
communist government was persecuting its people.
   Bryant said that former Attorney General Edwin Meese III invited
Nicaraguans to flee in a July 8, 1987, news release announcing a
liberalization of immigration standards for 200,000 Nicaraguan
exiles then in the United States. The administration strongly
indicated that none of the Nicaraguans would be deported.
   Bryant said there was a ``shocking discrepancy'' between the 53.1
percent approval rate for Nicaraguans from 1983-88 and the 2.7
percent approval for those fleeing the U.S.-backed government in El
Salvador. ``I have serious doubt about that much disproportion,'' he
said.
   Morrison asked Ms. Dobriansky, ``Do you have confidence that if
we go and look at a sampling (of cases) ... we will find no
ideological or political basis'' for asylum decisions?''
   ``I have not reviewed the cases,'' she said. ``We follow the
criteria.''

<TEXT>
   The House Armed Services committee will pass
judgment next week on an independent commission's proposal to close
86 military bases nationwide and partially close or realign 59
others.
   The action, slated for Tuesday, follows a 13-1 vote by the
subcommittee on military installations to oppose a resolution
disapproving the base closings. The full committee's action will be
only advisory, however, and the resolution will ultimately go before
the full House.
   The lone supporter of the resolution in Thursday's vote was Rep.
Jim Courter, R-N.J., who opposes the recommended closing of Fort Dix
in his state and who has said he believes the commission's
cost-benefit analyses are flawed.
   The Pentagon has sought for years to close a number of bases it
views as obsolete, duplicative or otherwise wasteful, but has been
consistently thwarted by members of Congress who protected
installations in their home districts.
   Last year, an independent 12-member Commission on Base
Realignment and Closure was set up to take a look at the issue and
recommend a list of bases for closing. It issued its report last
Dec. 29, and then-Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci forwarded the
recommendations to Congress in January.
   Under the law which established the commission, Congress must act
to accept or reject the recommendations in their entirety within 45
working days after March 1.
   The base closing commission reviewed more than 4,200 military
properties, focusing primarily on their military value but also
weighing environmental and socio-economic considerations.
   The commission said its recommendations would save $693.6 million
annually.

   The dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo on Friday, while share prices rebounded on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange after losing ground earlier in the day.
   The dollar closed at 128.88 yen, down 0.35 yen from Thursday's
129.23-yen finish. The currency opened at 128.85 yen and was traded
in a range between 128.82 yen and 129.08 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
181.21 points the previous day, recouped 45.33 points, or 0.14
percent, to finish trading at 31,701.78.
   The market's main index recovered from its 116.33 point-decline
in the morning session and gained ground in the afternoon.
   Exchange dealers said the market has been bearish since the end
of February because of unwillingness by fund managers to risk their
portfolios as the end of the accounting period for their mutual and
trust funds approaches. Japan's fiscal year ends March 31.
   ``Most fund managers appear to have won reasonable profits,
thanks to the bullish market throughout the year,'' said Keiichi
Nishida, a dealer at Kidder Peabody Securities in Tokyo. ``But most
of them have already cashed in and the market doesn't seem to have
much incentive for buying at this point.''
   He said the trend is likely to continue until the end of the
month.
   ``But market environment is not so bad, either,'' Nishida added.
``So, if share prices go down even further, investors may turn to
buying again.''
   The Nikkei, Tokyo's main economic barometer, has plunged more
than 700 points since Monday.
   In currency dealings, dealers said the dollar's weakness was
prompted by comments from U.S. Budget Director Richard Darman on
Thursday in which he discounted a tax increase. His statement
contradicted that of Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers, who said Wednesday that taxes may rise.
   Market anxiety over the U.S. unemployment figure for February, to
be released Friday in Washington, sidelined many players, added a
dealer at a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The report will provide one of the first indications of how the
American economy has responded to rising interest rates. The U.S.
Federal Reserve Board has been pursuing a restrictive monetary
policy to help slow growth and relieve inflationary pressures on the
economy.

   Eastern's union leaders vow to keep battling Texas
Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo through bankruptcy reorganization,
but some rank-and-file workers say they can't wait that long.
   ``Starting tomorrow, I'll be looking for another job after 12
years here,'' said Cynthia Carrasco, an office service worker and
single mother of two daughters. ``But I'll still be right out here
picketing and protesting. I want my paycheck. I've got rent, food,
clothing to buy.''
   Betsie Romano, a 20-year flight attendant, was on the picket line
Thursday pushing her 2-year-old daughter Beige in a stroller as news
of the Chapter 11 reorganization circulated. ``I was mentally
prepared, but financially, no,'' Ms. Romano said. ``My husband is
unemployed. My family's busted.''
   Yurbano Mayorquin, a 21-year electronics technician, said he'll
be looking for a new job at age 55. ``I'm going to try to start over
again,'' Mayorquin said.
   The Machinists union urged all workers to file for unemployment
compensation, though it was doubtful strikers would qualify.
Striking members also were urged to seek financial counseling and
loans from the Eastern employees credit union.
   The company indicated that this week's paychecks were frozen like
other Eastern liabilities because of the Chapter 11 filing. Union
attorneys are likely to ask the bankruptcy court to order the checks
released.
   Wally Haber, a Machinists district general chairman, said $100
weekly strike-fund payments won't begin for two more weeks under
union rules.
   The pilots' national union will make emergency payments to
Eastern pilots if no resolution occurs by March 15, when the pilots'
next check is due, union leaders said. Flight attendants were
uncertain whether they could obtain any such special benefits.
   Earlier Thursday, workers jammed around television sets in the
Machinists union hall, shouting at Lorenzo and Eastern President
Phil Bakes as they announced the bankruptcy filing in New York. They
cheered for the live telecast that followed of Machinists District
100 President Charles Bryan's news conference in Miami.
   ``It certainly is a sad day for Eastern,'' said Bryan, the
combative union leader who heads 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers
and other ground workers who struck the airline Saturday after talks
broke down in their 17-month contract dispute.
   The strike virtually shut down Eastern when pilots and flight
attendants refused to cross Machinists' picket lines.
   Bryan said his union will fight Lorenzo in bankruptcy court and
in Washington and will picket everything touched by Texas Air,
including a fuel tanker in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Eastern'
sister airline, Continental, where Lorenzo got labor contracts
abrogated in 1983 bankruptcy reorganization.
   The pilots, whose action was blamed by Lorenzo for forcing the
bankruptcy reorganization, also pledged to continue fighting any
sales of assets and to do battle in bankruptcy proceedings.
   ``Chapter 11 means there's still a patient and it's undergoing
surgery and it's coming back,'' said John Bavis, head of the Eastern
pilots. ``That's better than the continued slow dismantling of
Eastern under Texas Air.''
   Bavis said Lorenzo's statement blaming the pilots was
``amazing,'' and that the chairman had sought the strike so ``he can
break the unions and get rid of us once and for all.''
   Bryan said poor management, not Eastern's unions, was to blame
for the strike, and he repeated charges he's made for three years
that Lorenzo intended from the start to try to break the unions and
carve up Eastern.
   The union is urging a nationwide boycott of Continental, which
Bryan says is Lorenzo's ``war machine'' to take advantage of
Eastern's shutdown by expanding its low-cost services on Eastern
routes.

   Relations between the superpowers may seem as warm
as a McDonald's hamburger in Moscow, but a new flood of
anti-American attacks is showing the flip side of glasnost.
   While Soviets themselves are reading more good things about the
United States, their government is providing foreigners with
anti-U.S. material that harkens back to the Cold War.
   Many of the assertions have been heard before from the Soviets:
the FBI murdered the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the CIA massacred
Jim Jones and 900 of his People's Temple followers in Guyana.
   But now, they are part of ``glasnost,'' President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of greater openness, according to an editor at
the Soviet press agency Novosti.
   Hundreds of such anti-American charges are contained in booklets
published recently by Novosti, whose motto is ``Information for
Peace and International Friendship.''
   The deputy editor-in-chief of Novosti's North American
department, Yevgeny A. Posdnyakov, says the slick publications are
not just recycled Cold War propaganda but part of the campaign for
greater frankness.
   ``There is a need to write about everything so people will make
up their own mind and understand things,'' Posdnyakov said. ``The
demand that some zones be free from inquiry by journalists would be
an attack on glasnost.''
   The view from Washington is far different: at least one of the
Novosti books, ``Once Again About the CIA,'' is full of falsehoods
and innuendo designed to smear the reputation of the United States,
U.S. officials charge.
   ``We have discussed this book with the Soviets as a particularly
egregious example of what we call `disinformation,''' said U.S.
Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert.
   Nevertheless, ``Once Again About the CIA,'' whose cover shows
bloody corpses imposed on the Central Intelligence Agency's seal, is
being distributed in special waiting rooms of Moscow airports
reserved for foreigners. According to Posdnyakov, 10,000 copies were
printed in English.
   Novosti publications also are available in Intourist hotels,
whose clientele is largely foreign; from Aeroflot, the Soviet
airline; and from Soviet embassies and other institutions abroad.
   Paradoxically, the publication of the books, largely intended for
foreign markets, comes as official media whose audience is mostly
Soviet are finding much about the United States to praise.
   Ogonyok magazine recently asked whether a U.S.-style jury system
could be instituted, and on Thursday the Communist Party daily
Pravda lauded the taste of hamburgers from McDonald's, which has a
franchise in Moscow.
   The Novosti books strike a far different note. Among recent
releases:
   _ ``Silent Terror,'' billed as ``the book U.S. censors don't want
Americans to read.'' Written by former U.S. cancer researcher Arnold
Lockshin and his wife, Lauren, who obtained political asylum in the
Soviet Union in 1986, the book recounts ``the silent campaign of
harassment and terror which the FBI (the U.S. political police)
organized to force them to conform politically _ or be sorry.''
   The former Houston couple _ members of the Communist Party U.S.A.
who came to Moscow with their three children _ accuse the FBI of
waging an intimidation campaign that included the bugging of their
home.
   The Lockshins also say it was an ``inescapable conclusion ...
that the FBI murdered King,'' the late civil rights leader.
   Their book was printed in 10,000 copies in English, Posdnyakov
said.
   _ ``Once Again About the CIA,'' in 117 pages, accuses the U.S.
intelligence service of committing the ``monstrous crime'' of
killing the Rev. Jim Jones and more than 900 of his followers at
Jonestown, Guyana, in 1978 and of assassinating foreign leaders like
Panama's Omar Torrijos and the Congo's Patrice Lumumba.
   The booklet suggests that CIA made an unsuccessful attempt on the
pope's life in 1981, which an Italian state prosecutor linked
instead to the secret service of Bulgaria, a Soviet ally.

   One out of every three eighth- and 10th-graders
surveyed in 20 states said they have seriously considered killing
themselves, and many have poor health habits that include drinking,
smoking and ignorance of safe sex.
   Thirty-four percent of the 11,000 students _ 25 percent of the
boys and 42 percent of the girls _ reported that they had thought
seriously about ending their lives, and 15 percent had gone so far
as to attempt potentially fatal injuries, the national Centers for
Disease Control reported Thursday.
   Dr. Lloyd Kolbe, director of the CDC's Division of Adolescent and
School Health, said the suicide figures were surprising. ``We just
didn't think it would be that high,'' he said.
   He said it was the first time the suicide question had been asked
in the National Adolescent Student Health Survey, so researchers
lacked a bench mark for comparison.
   ``Many schools in the nation are teaching more about suicide,
about how to identify friends who may be suicidal and many school
faculty are being trained in how to deal with suicides should they
occur,'' Kolbe noted.
   He thought the findings added urgency to such activities. ``I
think what it means is that we need to begin exploring this a little
more and looking at what we can do,'' Kolbe said.
   The 1987 survey addressed questions about alcohol, drugs,
violence, suicide and sex to eighth- and 10th-grade students in
randomly selected classrooms chosen from a national sample of 217
schools in 20 states.
   In the eighth grade, 51 percent had tried smoking and 77 percent
had tried alcohol; by 10th grade, the numbers rose to 63 percent for
smoking and 89 percent for liquor.
   Overall, 22 percent reported smoking in the previous month and
about 32 percent reporting having five or more drinks at one time in
the previous two weeks.
   ``Drinking and drug use ... contributes very substantially to
homicide and suicide,'' Kolbe said.
   The survey also measured students' knowledge about health-related
topics:
   _Forty-seven percent believed wrongly that donating blood
increases the risk of AIDS.
   _Fifty-one percent thought incorrectly that washing after sex
could decrease the likelihood of getting AIDS.
   _Only 43 percent were able to figure out from a cereal box which
was the chief ingredient, and only 42 percent knew what the date on
a milk carton means.
   One bright spot was that more than 90 percent knew that having
sex with a person infected with AIDS or sharing drug needles
increases the chance of transmitting the virus, according to CDC
researchers.
   Kolbe said education and awareness could prevent many needless
deaths among young people.
   ``In the 1-to-24-year-old age group, there are only really four
(predominant) causes of death,'' he said, referring to car crashes,
other injuries, homicide and suicide.
   ``Those causes of death would be drastically reduced if we could
give young people the skills they need to avoid engaging in the
behavior that results in those causes,'' he said.
   Other survey findings:
   _Fifty-six percent of the students said they didn't wear their
seat belt the last time they rode in a car, and 44 percent of the
10th graders and 32 percent of the 8th graders reported riding in
the last month with someone who was drinking or on drugs.
   _Thirty-four percent of the students reported they'd been
threatened with violence in the preceding year, and 14 percent had
been robbed.
   _Twenty-three percent of the boys said they'd carried a knife in
the past year, and nearly one in 10 packed a knife every day.
   The margin of error for the survey was plus or minus 3.5
percentage points for each sex or grade category.

<TEXT>
   Britain's stiff upper lip broke into a big grin
today as millions of people put on red plastic noses, wallowed in
baked beans, donned gnome suits and pretty much turned the day into
a big laughing matter.
   Despite the outbreak of mass silliness, organizers of some worthy
causes will be laughing all the way to the bank if today's ``Red
Nose Day 2'' is as successful as last year's inaugural charity
drive, which raised $27 million.
   The idea behind the fund-raising effort, which was organized by a
group of British comedians and run by a coalition of groups called
Comic Relief, is to get Britons to loosen their pursestrings while
they laugh.
   Two-thirds of this year's cash will go to Third World projects
and to Princess Anne's Save the Children Fund, and the rest to
programs in Britain to help young people and the elderly.
   Britain has been gearing up for today all week. Cars, trucks and
taxis have been sporting big red plastic noses on their hoods and
radiators.
   On Thursday, Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke and two government
colleagues wore red plastic noses and posed for press photographers,
and soldiers paraded with guns and red noses at the Yeomanry
Barracks in York in northern England.
   Most Britons, however, saved their red noses for today. The goofy
89 cent props are purchased from the sponsoring charities, a
national store chain and in many pubs. A chain of gas stations is
selling the car schnozzes for $1.72.
   All proceeds go to Comic Relief.
   As of Thursday night, more than 4.5 million red noses for people
and 2 million for autos had been sold, with a big surge in sales
expected today.
   Rowan Atkinson, Billy Connolly and other top British comedians
predicted that 7 million Britons would don red noses today.
   Tied in with ``Red Nose Day 2'' are 50,000 fund-raising stunts
registered with Comic Relief.
   The stunts range from Ian Hunt's 10-hour wallow in a bathtub full
of cold baked beans at the Sutton Arms pub in London _ for which his
supporters have pledged $1,720 dollars _ to customers at a pub near
Swansea who will hold a candlelit supper atop eight tons of cow dung.
   Several of the staff at the historic Tower of London, one of the
capital's top tourist attractions, planned to spend their working
day clanking round in suits of armor.
   Officers at Leytonstone police station in east London will direct
evening traffic dressed as garden gnomes.
   As last year, the British Broadcasting Corp. plans a seven-hour
comedy extravaganza on television to mark Red Nose Day 2, starring
Comic Relief stalwart Lenny Henry, Atkinson, Rhys Jones, Phil
Collins and more than 100 other show business personalities.
   The French nobleman the Duc de Sully said 359 years ago that the
English take their pleasures sadly. Even today, not everyone is
enamored with red noses.
   ``There is a lot to be said for having no sense of humor... Life
is a vale of tears...'' Columnist Geoffrey Wheatcroft wrote today in
the London newspaper The Daily Telegraph on Friday:
   ``What is more objectionable about today's stunt than its
childishness is its forced merriment... Our own post-Christian
Christmas is bad enough, with its relentless mandatory mirth; it is
not hard to understand why the week around Dec. 25 has the highest
suicide rate of the year.''

   A growing political feud between two
of Yugoslavia's republics has prompted many Serbians to mount an
unprecedented boycott of Slovenian goods, according to news reports.
   Belgrade newspapers said Thursday that many businesses and
shoppers in Serbia, the largest of six republics, are shunning
products from Slovenia to protest support there for ethnic Albanians
who went on strike last month in the southern Serbian province of
Kosovo.
   On Feb. 27, prominent Slovenian intellectuals and politicians
came together in the republic's capital of Ljubljana to express
support for about 1,300 striking miners at the Trepca lead-zinc mine
in Kosovo.
   The federal government sent troop and tank reinforcements into
the province, but three provincial leaders viewed as pro-Serbian
resigned and the striking Kosovo miners ended their eight-day sit-in.
   Tensions between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have led to
mass protests through much of the past year.
   New reports of labor unrest in the province were still emerging.
The official Tanjug news agency said about 400 ethnic Albanian
miners at a nearby mine went on strike Thursday.
   Tanjug said the miners at the Goles magnesite mine, about 140
miles south of Belgrade, rallied at the company's head office and
demanded to talk to Kosovo officials.
   The reasons for strike were not immediately clear. But it
appeared to be ``politically motivated,'' said a journalist in the
provincial capital of Pristina.
   A day after the earlier strike ended, more than 500,000 angry
Serbs, claiming insult to their national pride, protested in
Belgrade against Slovenia.
   They also called for ending political pluralism in Slovenia, the
country's most liberal and industrial republic. Several independent
political groups have been established there in recent months.
   After the rally, hundreds of Serbians ran on the Belgrade branch
of the Slovenian Bank of Ljubljana, closing their accounts and
transferring the equivalent of at least $1.5 million to Serbian
banks, the Belgrade daily newspaper Borba said Thursday.
   Several Serbian businesses have threatened to break off business
with Slovenian firms if the companies refuse to condemn Slovenian
leadership for ``its support for Albanian separatists in Kosovo,''
the newspaper said.
   The Vulkan rubber plant in southern Serbia, a subsidiary of a
Slovenian tire manufacturer, served notice that it was severing its
ties with its mother company, the report said.
   It also said workers at a pig farm near Belgrade refused to allow
hogs that had already been paid for to be loaded on trucks for
transport to Slovenia.
   Shoppers throughout Serbia, meanwhile, have been boycotting
Slovenian goods, which are generally considered superior to local
products, the Vecernje Novosti newspaper reported Thursday.
   ``It is true that our customers are choosing Slovenian goods less
and less frequently,'' Milos Slijepcevic, chairman of Yugoslavia's
largest department store chain, Beograd, was quoted as saying.
   ``Shoppers are now disgusted ... and often loudly complain when
they see such goods on display,'' Slijepcevic was quoted as saying.
   Serbia has been trying to impose more central control on Kosovo,
which is administratively part of the republic but enjoys wide
autonomy under the present Yugoslav constitution.
   Serbian leaders claim that the minority Slav population is being
harassed by the Albanian majority there.

<HEAD>Moslem Fundamentalists Run Israeli City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   UMM EL-FAHM, Israel (AP) _ Moslem fundamentalists who won control
of this city say bad roads and big debts, not an Islamic revolution,
helped propel them to power.
   Nevertheless, some Israeli Jews say they are worried by the
outcome of the election in this northern town of 27,000 people.
   Government officials, scholars and editorial writers have warned
of a fundamentalist trend and some even suggest Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the Iranian patriarch, has become a revolutionary model
for Israeli Moslems.
   Israel has 810,000 Arab citizens, 18 percent of the population,
and 80 percent of them are Moslems.
   Sheik Raed Salah Mahajneh, a Moslem preacher and new mayor of Umm
el-Fahm, said his party won because the town is in disrepair and has
a debt of $3.9 million. He blamed that on skimpy government funding
and a poor job by the previous local administration, which the
communists supported.
   ``We are short of drainage, roads and schoolrooms,'' said the
30-year-old mayor, a policeman's son. ``Anywhere you put your
finger, there is something to be done. We are not in Iran, we are
here. We have been here since before the Iranian revolution.''
   Alex Bligh, a government adviser on Arab affairs, said complaints
of discrimination against Israeli Arabs were ``not totally
baseless.'' Despite improvements, he said, the ratio of government
funds devoted to Jewish and Arab towns is 4-1.
   Mahajneh has the full beard of a Moslem fundamentalist but he
greeted reporters this week in a stylish sweater, slacks and loafers.
   The Islamic Movement's use of mosque donations to build roads and
kindergartens in Arab areas is cited by many observers as a major
reason for its election success.
   A combination mosque, clinic and social center now being built in
Umm el-Fahm was financed with local donations and $45,000 from Cat
Stevens _ the American folk singer who changed his name to Yusef
Islam after becoming a Moslem, Mahajneh said.
   The five-story complex sits on a hill overlooking the town 35
miles northeast of Tel Aviv.
   Such efforts by the party have not arrested decades of neglect,
however. Open sewage drains and rutted, dirt roads are common in
Arab towns and villages.
   The Islamic Movement, which is challenging Communist domination
among Israeli Arabs, won leadership in Umm el-Fahm and two large
villages, and could win three more villages in run-off elections.
Six of the 19 council posts in the biblical city of Nazareth went to
Islamic candidates.
   Bligh, who spoke at a government forum on the elections, called
the victories ``a very disturbing development'' that could have
national implications if the Islamic Movement runs for parliament,
where Arabs occupy a half-dozen of the 120 seats.
   Rafi Israel, an expert on Islamic affairs at Hebrew University,
tied growing fundamentalism among Israel's Moslems to the Islamic
fervor of Khomeini and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. ``I can see
very alarming signs that things might get out of hand,'' he said.
   He noted that the concept of Islam as a system of government and
society as well as a religion were incompatible with the idea of a
Jewish state, and declared it ``nonsense'' to believe Arabs were
loyal citizens of Israel.
   Leaders of the Islamic Movement and newly elected Moslem
officials insist such fears are unfounded.
   ``We will not do anything outside the law,'' Mahajneh said. ``The
law will be here as it is in Tel Aviv.''

<HEAD>Best Way To Attack The Common Cold May Be To Fool It, Scientists
Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists reported today that the next best thing
to a cure for the common cold _ a way to prevent it _ may have
become possible at last by using a kind of cellular illusion to
trick the relentless virus.
   Two teams, working separately, have deciphered the chemical
hitching post that about half of all cold viruses use when they
latch onto cells in the nose and infect them.
   This seemingly arcane discovery may be an important key to
defeating one of humanity's most universal miseries.
   ``It is clearly feasible to develop a treatment based on what we
have learned,'' said Dr. Timothy A. Springer of the Center for Blood
Research in Boston.
   Their anti-cold strategy is simple: Fool the virus.
   The scientists have developed a detailed picture of the
rhinovirus receptor on the cells that make up the lining of the
nose. A cold occurs when a virus attaches itself to one these
receptors and infiltrates the cell.
   Researchers have isolated the gene responsible for making the
receptor, and as a result, they can produce it in limitless
quantities.
   They believe they can keep people healthy by flooding their noses
with copies of the receptor. If a cold virus wanders by, it will
harmlessly attack a dummy receptor and never find a susceptible nose
cell.
   No one knows for sure whether this ploy will work, although it
looks promising in a test tube. A similar scheme is being tested
against AIDS.
   ``If it works, it would be very exciting,'' commented Dr. Richard
Crowell, a virus researcher at Hahnemann University School of
Medicine in Philadelphia.
   Even if the scientific hunch is right, it will be several years
before such treatment is available. There will also be drawbacks.
The therapy will only work against rhinoviruses, which causes about
half of all colds, but it will be powerless against other cold
germs. And it probably will not stop colds once they start.
   ``This is not a cure. It is a scientific step,'' said Dr. Michael
E. Kamarck of Molecular Therapeutics in West Haven, Conn.
   Reports on the two teams' conclusions were published in the
journal Cell. One study was conducted at the Center for Blood
Research, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and Boehringer
Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals in Ridgefield, Conn., and the other at
Molecular Therapeutics, part of Miles Inc., a pharmaceutical firm.
   Springer said his group has already produced a soluble form of
the virus receptor, but they are attempting to develop a version
that will be even more effective as a virus-fooling drug.
   Experts predicted that such a treatment would probably be used as
a nose spray or drops. Since it would be impractical _ and probably
expensive _ to use the drops daily, people might take the medicine
when they are especially worried about getting colds.
   For instance, parents might take the treatment to protect
themselves when their child brings home a cold. Or an athlete might
use it to keep from catching a cold before an important game.
   Scientists said the discovery resulted from combining two lines
of separate research.
   Springer has worked for several years on a structure on the
surface of cells called intercellular adhesion molecule-1, or
ICAM-1. This protein is the receptor that white blood cells use to
hook themselves onto the body's tissues _one step in coordinating
the response to infection and triggering inflammation.
   Meanwhile, Dr. Richard Colonno of the drug firm Merk, Sharp &amp;
Dohme discovered three years ago that 90 percent of all rhinoviruses
attach themselves to just one receptor when they attack the body.
   In the latest work, the scientists found that ICAM-1 is the
portal for both blood cells and cold viruses.
   ``The big thing has been the identification of the two proteins
that we worked on separately being one and the same,'' Colonno said.

<HEAD>Birds, Tribesmen Whistle While They Work in Search of Honey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wild African bird that leads the way to
hidden beehives cuts by nearly two-thirds the time tribesmen must
spend beating around the bush for honey, according to research
proving a unique form of cooperation between species.
   In a study published today in the journal Science, scientists
from Kenya and West Germany say they repeatedly observed a bird
called the greater honeyguide direct people from the Boran tribe in
Africa to the hidden hives of wild honey bees.
   The cooperation between human and honeyguide is the only known
instance in which non-domesticated animals willfully and freely work
with humans to find food in the wild, said Frank Gill, a bird expert
in Philadelphia who was not part of the research.
   The people gather the honey and the birds feed on larvae and wax
left behind, the report says.
   Such a bird had been the subject of myth, part of which calls for
punishment for honey gatherers who refuse to share with the birds.
When that happens, the bird leads the people to a lion or leopard
the next time.
   H. A. Isack of the National Museum of Kenya and H. U. Reyer of
Max Planck Institute in West Germany reported in the article that
they spent three years watching the bird guide people to 186 honey
bee nests.
   The mutual hunt begins, they report, when members of the Boran
tribe create a whistle by blowing through clasped fists or through
hollow shells or nuts.
   Attracted by the whistle, the bird flies to where the people wait.
   ``The greater honeyguide draws the attention of a human by flying
close to him, moving restlessly between perches around him and
emitting a double-noted, persistent call, which sounds like
`tirr-tirr-tirr-tirr,' '' the study says.
   Moments later, the bird will fly away for a minute or more, an
event called the ``first disappearance.''
   When the bird returns, it perches near the humans and gives a
call. When approached to within 15 feet, the bird flies a short
distance away, displaying white tail feathers, and continues to call
to the people.
   ``As the Borans follow, they whistle, bang on wood, and talk
loudly to the bird to keep it interested in the guiding,'' the
report said. ``This pattern of leading and following is repeated
until the bee colony is reached.''
   Isack and Reyer said they proved that the bird's actions were no
accident by repeatedly allowing birds to lead them back to an
untouched beehive.
   ``From different compass points, the bird led us via different,
but again fairly direct, routes,'' the authors reported.
   The study said Borans claim that the birds' actions are based on
the distance to the hive. Those actions included the length of the
``first disappearance,'' the distance between perches as the bird
guides, and the height of the tree limbs the bird picks as perches
during the guiding.
   ``We found all three Boran statements to be true,'' the authors
said.
   Upon arrival at the bee's hive, Isack and Reyer said the
honeyguide bird perches close to the nest and sings a new song, one
that differs from the guiding call. The bird may also fly around the
hive to indicate its location.
   The authors said they staked out some previously-discovered bee
hives and learned that the honeyguide bird would regularly visit
untouched bee nests, sometimes even flying to the hive's entrance
and peering into it.
   ``The information gathered during such visits enables the bird to
engage in its goal-oriented guiding behavior,'' the authors said.
   Borans, who rely on honey as an important part of their diet,
also hunt for honey when no greater honeyguides are around.
   The authors said that in an unfamiliar area the Borans need about
8.9 hours to find a honey hive, but only 3.2 hours when guided by
the bird.

   Nearly a third of all poor children have no
health insurance and nearly 30 percent of children in low-income
families are uninsured, according to a Children's Defense Fund
report.
   The report by the private organization said 32.4 percent of all
poor children and 28.7 percent of children in families with incomes
between 100 percent and 200 percent of the poverty line had no
health insurance in 1986.
   The report warned many children not covered by private,
employer-based health insurance programs are also not getting
adequate coverage under the federal-state Medicaid program and other
health assistance programs.
   ``When the savings and loan industry has a crisis, political
leaders find at least $60 billion to bail them out,'' said
Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman. ``When our
children are dying and being disabled from preventable causes, our
political leaders offer fiscal Band-Aids and say we cannot afford
the few billion to build a health floor to keep our babies alive and
healthy,'' said Edelman in releasing the report during the group's
three-day annual conference this week.

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Grows By $4.4 Billion in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Revised government figures show Americans
borrowed $4.4 billion more than they repaid in January, edging the
annual rate of consumer debt to 7.9 percent.
   The Federal Reserve Board said Thursday the January increase
followed a revised increase of $4.3 billion in December and a gain
of $4.7 billion in November.
   January's increase in the seasonally adjusted rate of credit
growth was up slightly from a 7.8 percent in December but well below
the 8.5 percent rate in November.
   The Fed said a slower growth in auto loans and the category of
debt that includes credit cards helped keep the increase from being
greater , while loans for mobile homes increased after falling
sharply in December.

Health Administration said the money would be targeted for public
and private nonprofit organizations that are providing out-patient
or residential drug treatment services.
   The agency was most concerned with helping reduce and eliminate
the waiting lists of programs where applicants have been waiting
more than a month to be admitted. Goodwin said in some cities the
current wait to enter programs can be six months and longer.
   ``Given the fact that approximately one-third of all new AIDS
cases are contracted through use of contaminated intravenous
needles, it is especially critical that the nation's ability to
provide treatment to drug abusers be expanded,'' Goodwin said
Thursday as he announced the program.
   In addition to the new grant program, Frederick's agency, part of
the Department of Health and Human Services, is providing $518
million this fiscal year in block grants to states for substance
abuse treatment and prevention programs, a spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Historian Says Soviets Were Guilty for Executing Polish Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Polish historian studying a World War II
massacre of more than 4,000 Polish army officers said he is
convinced the Soviets are to blame for the executions.
   Historian and parliament deputy Jarema Maciszewski made the
remarks in an interview Thursday in the official Communist Party
newspaper Trybuna Ludu. He serves as chairman of the Polish side of
a joint Polish-Soviet commission studying what are called historical
``blank spots.''
   The historian was quoted as saying he believes a tentative
conclusion blaming the Soviet Union for the killings at Katyn Forest
will stand.
   ``The expertise unequivocally indicates that all goes to show the
NKVD bodies (Soviet secret police) committed the crimes,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   The Soviet side on the commission, however, ``drew attention to
the fact that the data presented by us ... does not contain, because
it cannot contain, direct evidence of guilt,'' he said in the
interview.
   Maciszewski's interview followed similar remarks Tuesday by
government spokesman Jerzy Urban at his weekly news conference. He
announced two weeks ago that a Warsaw monument to the Katyn victims,
calling them victims of ``Hitler's fascism,'' will be changed.
   The Polish officers were shot through the back of the head and
buried in mass graves uncovered by the Germans at Katyn, near the
Soviet city of Smolensk, in 1943. The victims later were identified
as having been imprisoned in the Soviet Union shortly after the
September 1939 outbreak of World War II.
   The Nazis invaded Poland from the west and the Soviets followed
with an attack from the east when the war began. Germany and the
Soviet Union then signed a non-aggression pact which Hitler broke in
1941, sending invasion forces into the Soviet Union.
   Since assuming power at the end of World War II, communist
authorities in Poland had supported the Soviet version of the
massacre, asserting that the crime was committed by the Nazis in
1941 after their invasion of the Soviet Union.
   Most Poles and historians in the West had long ago concluded that
the killings were carried out on the orders of Stalin in 1940, when
Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were still allied.
   The Katyn episode has come to constitute one of the most
emotional issues in Polish-Soviet relations. For many Poles, it is a
symbol of a long series of Soviet crimes against their country.
   In 1987, Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed to appoint the joint commission to study
Katyn and other painful ``blank spots'' in history.
   Last month, after a parliament deputy complained that the Soviet
side was dragging its feet, Maciszewski unveiled a wartime Polish
Red Cross document found in British archives. He said it gave
incontrovertible evidence that the killings took place in 1940,
before the Nazis occupied the Katyn area.

<TEXT>
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat said today that
he and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi were trying to develop a peace
plan for Afghanistan, United News of India reported.
   ``We are doing our best to achieve a final settlement in the
Afghanistan issue,'' the news agency quoted Arafat as saying as he
inaugurated the New Delhi embassy of the recently declared state of
Palestine.
   Arafat refused to give details. He later met Afghanistan's
ambassador to New Delhi, Abdul Samad Azhar, UNI said.
   On Thursday, Arafat met in Pakistan with leaders of the Afghan
guerrillas who have been fighting the Kabul government for the past
decade.
   The PLO leader told the guerrillas to be more politically
realistic, according to a source close to them who spoke on
condition of anonymity. That could mean compromising with the
Soviet-style government of President Najib.
   The guerrillas have vowed to continue fighting until Najib and
his People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan is ousted from power.
The Soviet Union ended its nine-year military intervention in
Afghanistan on Feb. 15, leaving government forces to fight alone
against the guerrillas, who are backed by the United States and
Pakistan.
   Arafat flew from Islamabad to New Delhi on Thursday for a state
visit lasting about 21 hours, before heading to Bangladesh.
   The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization has been
accorded head-of-state treatment by the three countries in
recognition of the PLO's declaration last November of an independent
Palestinian nation on territory occupied by Israel.

<HEAD>Desire to Go Abroad Leads to Corruption, Official Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The desire to leave China was the major cause of
the most serious corruption cases in Shanghai, an official daily
said today.
   The China Youth News said in six of 15 cases now before Shanghai
courts, young people either embezzled money or took bribes in order
to finance a life abroad.
   One 26-year-old accountant in a Shanghai embezzeled nearly
$19,000 so he could study in Australia. A businessman in a textile
company obtained $13,500 by embezzlement and bribery after he got a
passport and visa.
   An 23-year-old accountant in a bank embezzled $5,670 by making
false receipts to pay for her way out of China.
   The report said next most common were cases of people taking
bribes in connection with construction contracts.
   One deputy general manager of a construction company received
more than $27,000 in bribes for subcontracting work for a Chinese
Academy of Sciences building.
   Another man, named a ``construction hero'' for his good deeds for
Shanghai, was charged with taking $35,100 in bribes.
   China is now waging a nationwide campaign against corruption,
which has become increasingly serious in recent years because of
shortages of commodity goods and raw materials, rough edges in the
new market economy, and price discrepancies between
government-controlled items and those selling on free markets.

<HEAD>With PM-Eastern Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a rundown on how Eastern Airlines' Chapter 11 bankruptcy
filing will affect the carrier's operations:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>GENERAL OPERATIONS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Under federal bankruptcy law, Eastern can continue flying and
reorganize its finances while protected from creditors. Any
reorganization plan is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court
and creditors.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>EMPLOYEES:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern may have a difficult time imposing lower wages on
striking employees since federal law requires bankrupt companies to
negotiate with unions and prove economic necessity before abrogating
their contracts.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes said the carrier is prepared to hire
non-union pilots if pilots honoring the Machinists' strike do not
return to work.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PASSENGERS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The bankruptcy court must approve ticket refunds, said Eastern
spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak, adding that she did not know how the
process would work. In the eyes of the court, ticketholders are
considered unsecured creditors, trailing secured creditors in
priority.
   But passengers who bought tickets with a major credit card
probably won't have to stand in line at the courthouse since federal
law protects consumers who make credit card purchases but fail to
receive goods or services. At Visa U.S.A. Inc., for example,
requests for credit must be submitted no more than 120 days after
the flight date, said spokesman David Brancoli.
   Eastern, meanwhile, will try to get as many planes back in the
air as possible in order to make ``old tickets good,'' Bakes said.
   The company also plans to renegotiate agreements with other
carriers to honor Eastern tickets. Passengers have had mixed success
trying to swap Eastern tickets for seats on other carriers.
Continental Airlines is accepting Eastern tickets, but other
airlines have different policies.
   Chances remained good that if the passenger's destination were a
popular one, another carrier would honor the ticket, although
possibly at a higher price.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ROUTES:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Currently operating shuttle flights linking Boston, New York and
Washington as well as scaled-back service to Latin America, Eastern
plans to restore unspecified routes as its financial situation
improves. Bakes said, however, that the carrier's ``immediate
emphasis'' will be on the shuttle and Latin American routes.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TAKEOVER BIDS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern's bankruptcy filing would not prevent takeover bids,
though an acquisition might be cumbersome since creditor and
bankruptcy court approval is required. Bakes said he would not
speculate on ``any future transactions,'' an apparent reference to
Trans World Airlines Chairman and takeover strategist Carl Icahn,
who has said he is willing to discuss a bid for the airline.
   Bakes said Eastern will consider selling assets to restore
liquidity, like the planned $365 million sale of the shuttle to New
York developer Donald Trump. Assets sales also require court
approval.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>INVESTORS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bakes said ``all creditors will be fully paid'' and shareholders
can expect fair value for their stock. But Standard and Poor's
Corp., a major credit-rating agency, either downgraded or expressed
concern about $277.2 million of Eastern debt.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SOUTH FLORIDA'S ECONOMY:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The state Commerce Department estimated Eastern's payroll in Dade
County, which includes Miami, has added $500 million a year to the
economy, plus $150 million in indirect income based on employee
purchases.
   Tom Ferguson, president of the county's Beacon Council economic
development group, estimated the Miami-based carrier has a $1
billion to $1.5 billion impact in a $50 billion local economy.
   ``Miami was hurting even before the strike,'' said J. Antonio
Villamil, chief economist with Southeast Bank. ``Because of what has
happened, our economy will be flat at best in 1989.''

<HEAD>Veddy Funny: Millions Of Britons Don Red Noses</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's stiff upper lip broke into a big grin
today as millions of people put on red plastic noses, wallowed in
baked beans, donned gnome suits and pretty much turned the day into
a big laughing matter.
   Despite the outbreak of mass silliness, organizers of some worthy
causes will be laughing all the way to the bank if today's ``Red
Nose Day 2'' is as successful as last year's inaugural charity
drive, which raised $27 million.
   The idea behind the fund-raising effort, which was organized by a
group of British comedians and run by a coalition of groups called
Comic Relief, is to get Britons to loosen their pursestrings while
they laugh.
   Two-thirds of this year's cash will go to Third World projects
and to Princess Anne's Save the Children Fund, and the rest to
programs in Britain to help young people and the elderly.
   Britain has been gearing up for today all week. Cars, trucks and
taxis have been sporting big red plastic noses on their hoods and
radiators.
   On Thursday, Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke and two government
colleagues wore red plastic noses and posed for press photographers,
and soldiers paraded with guns and red noses at the Yeomanry
Barracks in York in northern England.
   Most Britons, however, saved their red noses for today. The goofy
89 cent props are purchased from the sponsoring charities, a
national store chain and in many pubs. A chain of gas stations is
selling the car schnozzes for $1.72.
   All proceeds go to Comic Relief.
   As of Thursday night, more than 4.5 million red noses for people
and 2 million for autos had been sold, with a big surge in sales
expected today.
   Rowan Atkinson, Billy Connolly and other top British comedians
predicted that 7 million Britons would don red noses today.
   Tied in with ``Red Nose Day 2'' are 50,000 fund-raising stunts
registered with Comic Relief.
   The stunts range from Ian Hunt's 10-hour wallow in a bathtub full
of cold baked beans at the Sutton Arms pub in London _ for which his
supporters have pledged $1,720 dollars _ to customers at a pub near
Swansea who will hold a candlelit supper atop eight tons of cow dung.
   Several of the staff at the historic Tower of London, one of the
capital's top tourist attractions, planned to spend their working
day clanking round in suits of armor.
   Officers at Leytonstone police station in east London will direct
evening traffic dressed as garden gnomes.
   As last year, the British Broadcasting Corp. plans a seven-hour
comedy extravaganza on television to mark Red Nose Day 2, starring
Comic Relief stalwart Lenny Henry, Atkinson, Rhys Jones, Phil
Collins and more than 100 other show business personalities.
   The French nobleman the Duc de Sully said 359 years ago that the
English take their pleasures sadly. Even today, not everyone is
enamored with red noses.
   ``There is a lot to be said for having no sense of humor... Life
is a vale of tears...'' Columnist Geoffrey Wheatcroft wrote today in
the London newspaper The Daily Telegraph on Friday:
   ``What is more objectionable about today's stunt than its
childishness is its forced merriment... Our own post-Christian
Christmas is bad enough, with its relentless mandatory mirth; it is
not hard to understand why the week around Dec. 25 has the highest
suicide rate of the year.''

   A National Park Service ranger says he
remains optimistic about the fate of three missing Japanese climbers
who have been on Mount McKinley for two weeks.
   The men were described as experienced climbers with excellent
gear and a radio, although contact has not been made.
   ``The ingredients (for survival) are there if they can put it
together,'' Ranger Bob Seibert said Thursday. ``It's been a long
time, though. It sure has.''
   Hurricane-force wind around North America's largest peak
prevented rugged Army helicopters from joining the search Thursday.
An Air Force plane sent up to check wind conditions around the peak
65 miles from Talkeetna reached the 14,000-foot level and
encountered turbulence.
   Crews planned to try again today.
   The climbers were seen by an Austrian team on Feb. 22. The
Austrians were descending and the apanese, who set out Feb. 16, were
ascending the 20,320-foot peak.
   ``It took the Austrians a few days to get down. Nobody has heard
from the Japanese since,'' said John Quinley, a park service
spokesman.
   The climbers' rations probably ran out days ago, but the Park
Service has a cache of food and water at 17,200 feet, Quinley said.
   Members of the Japanese party are leader Noboru Yamada, 39, Teruo
Saegusa, 31, and Kozo Komatsu, 34, all of Tokyo.

   Florida Institute of Technology blocked
plans to put free condoms in copies of today's student newspaper to
promote safe sex during spring break.
   Staffers of The FIT Crimson wanted to insert 6,200 condoms
donated by the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services and Brevard County Public Health Department in the last
issue before the school's spring break.
   The 20-page issue deals solely with safe sex. But after hearing
of the plans late Thursday, FIT administrators said the condoms
could be given only to students who ask for them.
   Condoms have not been available for sale on the FIT campus, but
an AIDS educational task force at the school is expected to
recommend installing condom vending machines there soon, FIT
officials said.

   A young soldier killed by an IRA land mine
left behind a sealed envelope with a simple poem that urged his
family not to cry at his grave.
   Stephen Cummins, 24, was one of two British soldiers killed when
their convoy struck a mine near the Northern Ireland city of
Londonderry on Wednesday.
   His parents, Sheila and Geoff Cummins, had been keeping an
envelope that their son told them not to open unless something
happened to him. On Thursday, they opened the envelope and found
solace from the person they mourned.
   ``Stephen has never done anything like this before. We assume he
copied the poem from somewhere but it has made us realize what a
wonderful son we had,'' said Geoff Cummins.
   But Debbie Turley, 26, who was engaged to marry Cummins in
August, said he was always writing poems.
   Geoff Cummins described his son as a committed and responsible
professional soldier. ``But he would not want to be called a hero.
There is nothing heroic about dying like that,'' the father said.
   The poem reads:
   ``To all my loved ones,
   ``Do not stand at my grave and weep, I am not there, I do not
sleep,
   ``I am a thousand winds that blow,
   ``I am the diamond glints on snow,
   ``I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
   ``I am the gentle autumn rain,
   ``When you awaken in the morning's hush,
   ``I am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled flight,
   ``I am the soft stars that shine at night,
   ``Do not stand at my grave and cry,
   ``I am not there. I did not die.''
   He signed the poem: ``Anonymous'' and added: ``Thank you,
forever, always and a day. Stephen Jeffrey Cummins.''

<HEAD>Boxing Causing Dozens of Military Hospitalizations Yearly, Study
Finds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors today delivered a haymaker to the U.S.
military's boxing program, saying the sport used to maintain fitness
for decades has killed at least one soldier and hospitalized 401
others over a six-year period.
   Army soldiers spent 2,056 days in the hospital and logged 3,581
sick days because of boxing injuries from 1980 through 1985,
military doctors said in today's issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   ``Head injuries accounted for 68 percent of all boxing-related
hospitalizations and 81 percent of (boxing-related) injuries to U.S.
Military Academy cadets,'' said the doctors, led by Maj. Robert W.
Enzenauer, an eye doctor at Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in
Aurora, Colo.
   But a former military boxing coach disagreed with the study,
saying the sport provides excellent mental and physical training and
probably produces fewer serious injuries than college football or
wrestling.
   ``In football, you have the kids that are paralyzed, the kids
that die,'' said Emerson Smith, head boxing coach at the U.S. Naval
Academy for 27 years and chairman of the U.S.A. Amateur Boxing
Federation's Safety Committee.
   ``I don't believe there's any high school or college ... where
you have contact sports where you'll eliminate all serious injury,''
he said.
   Instructional boxing is mandatory at U.S. service academies.
Military graduates known for their boxing prowess as undergraduates
include former Navy Secretary James Webb and retired Marine Col.
Oliver North.
   Enzenauer, who boxed when he attended the U.S. Military Academy,
said sports like the martial arts or fencing would provide the same
benefits without the risks of injury to the central nervous system.
   ``It's inconsistent to train a soldier, to spend money on him, to
teach him how to fly a helicopter, to repair a jeep, to drive a
tank, and then (to have him) participate in a sport that could
conceivably make him unfit for duty,'' Enzenauer said in a telephone
interview Thursday.
   ``There is other military training ... that can teach a soldier
how to deal with fear, how to improve his self-confidence, his
self-esteem, without offering such a risk,'' he said.
   Unlike football or wrestling, the objective in boxing is to
achieve a knockout, which by definition is an injury to the brain,
Enzenauer said.
   The study found that 401 soldiers had been hospitalized in the
six-year period, and one died after complications from bleeding
inside the skull caused by boxing. Another was blinded in one eye.
   ``Evidence that boxing produces irreversible brain damage is now
as indisputable as the link between cigarette smoking and lung
cancer,'' the doctors wrote.
   Concussions, bruising of brain tissue, bleeding inside the skull,
broken facial bones and eye injuries were among the types of head
trauma recorded.
   The study did not examine the price tag for hospital care and
lost productivity due to boxing but said the cost ``is certainly
considerable.''
   Military boxing has served as a springboard to some spectacular
careers. Leon Spinks, a Marine when he won a gold medal at the 1976
Montreal Olympics, eventually defeated Muhammad Ali for the world
heavyweight title.
   Three gold medalists at the 1988 Olympics were U.S. Army boxers.

<HEAD>Salinas Stronger With Dramatic Moves In First 100 Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari today marks the
100th day of his presidency as a more powerful leader whose
political skills have earned respect even from critics.
   The bald, mustachioed 40-year-old economist won the slimmest
victory in the history of his party, which has controlled Mexican
politics for most of this century. He then struggled through rocky
early days when his opponents claimed the election was rigged.
   Since then, however, he has widened his support with measures
aimed at restoring economic confidence and political stability in
advance of vital negotiations over Mexico's foreign debt.
   ``He has gained credibility,'' said Pablo Emilio Madero, former
presidential candidate and a leader of the conservative National
Action Party. The party is the country's second largest behind the
government's Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   Salinas took office after a fraud-marred election in which he
polled barely more than 50 percent. The governing party ended up
with a 260-240 margin in Congress, its lowest ever, and a vocal
leftist coalition that predicted Salinas wouldn't last.
   But infighting has weakened the leftist coalition put together by
Salinas' main opponent in the election, said opposition leader
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.
   And on the right, Salinas undercut conservatives by moving to
weed out corruption, install a freer economy, and improve government
relations with the Roman Catholic church.
   ``Salinas has more political strength now than he did at the
start of his administration,'' said Jorge Arrambide, director of an
association of business groups in the northern state of Nuevo Leon.
``He has struck some spectacular blows with the purpose of getting
massive popular support he did not have in the elections.''
   In January, Salinas' popularity soared when he cracked down on
corrupt oil union leaders once considered invulnerable. He showed an
even hand by also jailing top businessmen accused of shady dealings
during the 1987 stock market crash.
   Salinas appeased the left by firing a hard-line police official
and releasing political prisoners, acknowledging their existence for
the first time.
   He also pledged to wean his party from its chronic use of state
resources in election campaigns and of vote-rigging _ pledges still
questioned by the opposition.
   ``He is making decisions,'' said Jesus Cantu, director of the
independent newspaper El Porvenir. ``The question is whether the
decisions will result in something good or turn out to be just a
little makeup.''
   The government's most immediate problem is the foreign debt,
estimated by the World Bank at $107.4 billion. Salinas wants to cut
in half annual payments, which totaled $14 billion last year, to
free funds for economic growth.
   The economy has been stagnant for six years, and Salinas is under
pressure from a growing population whose standard of living has
dropped steadily. An estimated 1 million new jobs are needed a year.
   Political parties and business groups have rallied to Salinas'
efforts to stem the cash flow resulting from the debt. Nationwide
riots last week in Venezuela also may help Salinas' cause by
alarming creditors.
   Some say the toughness Salinas displayed against the oil union
could just as easily be turned on creditors.
   ``Creditors need to believe that Mexico will resort to a
suspension of payments,'' said Jonathan Heath, chief economic
analyst for the Macro Asesoria consulting firm. ``Salinas has proven
he could provide a credible threat.''

superpowers doesn't suit everyone in the U.S.A.,'' the official Tass
news agency said in its lengthy dispatch today.
   It called the expulsion of Lt. Col. Yuri N. Pakhtusov a
``provocative action.''
   However, there was no immediate word on any Soviet retaliation.
   Pakhtusov, a military attache at the Soviet Embassy in
Washington, was ordered to leave the United States on Thursday after
a six-month FBI investigation culminated in his arrest Wednesday
night.
   A U.S. source identified the 35-year-old Soviet as a member of
GRU, the Soviet military's intelligence arm.
   U.S. officials said he was ordered home after the FBI caught him
receiving sensitive information on how the U.S. government protects
computer secrets.
   Tass mocked those charges and expressed outrage at the FBI's
treatment of Pakhtusov following the arrest outside his Virginia
home.
   ``FBI agents seized Pakhtusov late Wednesday evening, when,
before going to sleep, he left his apartment to put garbage in the
garbage chute. He went out in house slippers, sweatpants, and a
T-shirt,'' Tass said. ``You'll agree that people don't go out into
the cold to receive secret documents dressed like that.''
   Tass said the FBI agents handcuffed Pakhtusov and put him in a
car. The agency said they offered him money to defect, but the
diplomat refused.
   It also said he was not allowed to return to his apartment to
tell his wife what happened or to dress in warmer clothes, and he
was not allowed to call the Soviet Embassy right away.
   ``Even a murderer in the U.S.A. is given the right when arrested
to make one telephone call,'' Tass said.
   The news agency said it is sad that the arrest came at a time
when more Americans are developing ``sympathetic and unconcealed
interest'' in the Soviet Union.
   It said, however, that some Americans are able to ``benefit by
portraying Soviet diplomats as spies and supplying nonexistent proof.

<HEAD>Mammograms Increased After Nancy Reagan News, Other Cancer Publicity</HEAD>

   Nancy Reagan's triumph over breast cancer and a
publicity campaign about the disease may have sent thousands of
women to their doctors for potentially life-saving mammograms,
federal health officials reported.
   A survey of health behavior in 33 states by the Centers for
Disease Control found that 38 percent of women age 50 and older
questioned in November and December 1987 said they had received a
mammogram for breast cancer within a year.
   Those findings, shortly after the then first lady's October
diagnosis, marked an increase of nearly 50 percent over the 26
percent the survey found in the first two months of that year.
   Medical centers in the United States reported after Mrs. Reagan's
diagnosis that the demand for mammograms had gone up. She was later
honored with an American Cancer Society award for her efforts to
encourage women to check for breast cancer.
   A springtime media campaign by the cancer society promoted
screening for breast cancer, and data from the survey ``suggest that
the media events and educational activities were accompanied by
increases in screening mammograms,'' the CDC said.
   The increases in mammograms ``may be related to enhanced public
awareness during the ACS spring campaign and after Mrs. Reagan's
diagnosis,'' the CDC said, although the agency added that the data
cannot directly prove such a connection statistically.
   The cancer society recommends that all women 50 or older have a
mammogram each year.
   Overall, in the CDC's 1987 behavioral risk factor survey, 29
percent of the women 50 and up said they had been screened for
breast cancer in the preceding 12 months.
   The survey excluded women who had mammograms because of a
specific health problem or history, or those who hadn't seen a
doctor for a routine examination at all.
   Other studies also have found that most American women 50 or
older have never had a mammogram, despite recommendations that they
should. Cancer specialists at the CDC and elsewhere say increased
use of mammograms would increase early detection of breast cancer,
raising survival rates for patients.
   Aside from annual mammograms for women 50 and up, the American
Cancer Society recommends that women between 35 and 40 have one
initial mammogram, and that women 40-49 have one each year or two.
   Breast cancer, second to lung cancer as a cause of cancer deaths
among women, kills about 40,000 U.S. women each year.

<HEAD>Scientist Testing Whether Some Sunscreens Create Cancer Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The active ingredient in some commercial
sunscreens can break down into a substance that causes cancer,
according to a study that has prompted further testing to determine
whether there is any risk to users.
   In tests by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 14 of 17
sunscreens containing the sun-blocking agent padimate O, itself used
to prevent skin cancer from overexposure, were found to contain a
newly discovered nitrosamine, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported
Thursday.
   Nitrosamines are a class of compounds notorious for their
cancer-causing ability. Roughly 90 percent of the 300 nitrosamines
tested so far have been shown to cause cancer in animals.
   ``We have a saying in this field _ guilty until proven
innocent,'' said Stephen S. Hecht, director of research at the
American Health Foundation in Valhalla, N.Y.
   ``You just never know,'' he told the Post-Dispatch. ``Basically,
any nitrosamine is cause for concern.''
   But representatives of major health organizations and the
sunscreen industry said people who want to protect themselves from
sun-caused skin cancers should continue to use commercially
available sunscreens until more testing is done.
   Scientists said testing so far has not established whether the
newly discovered nitrosamine is a strong enough carcinogen to
present any substantial risk to people who use sunscreens.
   William Lijinsky, an authority on nitrosamines at the federally
owned Frederick Cancer Research Facility in Frederick, Md., said the
nitrosamine, which goes by the initials NPABAO, probably was a
``very weak carcinogen.''
   ``Compounds of this structure would have a very low activity or
are inactive,'' Lijinsky said.
   Representatives of the American Dermatological Academy and the
American Cancer Society said they were unaware of the nitrosamine in
sunscreens. They said that until officials reviewed any information
that sunscreens were harmful, the groups would continue to recommend
the use of sunscreens to protect against damage from the sun.
   ``If you want to scare people into not using sunscreens, the
public health implications are super,'' said Gerald McEwen, vice
president of science for the Washington-based Cosmetics, Toiletries
and Fragrance Association.
   Padimate O, the sun-blocking agent, is found in some, but not
all, sunscreen products, he noted. The association collaborated with
the Food and Drug Administration to discover NPABAO in sunscreens,
then communicated information about it industrywide.
   McEwen stressed that nitrosamines were a large class of chemicals
found widely in the natural environment and that most human exposure
occurred naturally, such as by eating vegetables and other foods.
   But three other experts said that because NPABAO is probably
carcinogenic. The three are Hecht, of the private, non-profit
American Health Foundation; Richard N. Loeppky, a professor of
chemistry at the University of Missouri at Columbia; and John S.
Wishnok, a biochemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
in Cambridge, Mass.
   Nitrosamines first gained widespread notice in the 1970s. They
were found in tobacco smoke and snuff, vegetables and processed
meats, alcoholic beverages, cosmetics, pesticides, baby-bottle
nipples, synthetic grinding fluids, tire manufacturing plants and
even new cars.
   The FDA has yet to determine the origin of the NPABAO, or whether
it is easily absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream, as
some other nitrosamines are.
   Officials of the FDA have declined to identify the sunscreen
brands in the tests. Results of the tests were first reported in May
at the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer in Omaha, Neb.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Third World, challenging industrial nations on
yet another environmental issue, is slowing efforts to eliminate
chemicals that are eating away the Earth's crucial ozone layer.
   Prodded by increasing scientific evidence that
chlorofluorocarbons are destroying the ozone shield protecting Earth
from cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, the West has promised to ban
or significantly reduce their use by the end of the century.
   Third World countries do not dispute the facts and figures, but
they are just embarking on large-scale expansion of refrigeration,
air conditioning, plastics and electronics industries, most of which
depend on chlorofluorocarbons.
   Australia's science minister, speaking an an international
conference in London this week, wondered aloud if it is fair to ask
for equal measures in both kinds of countries.
   ``This raises a major moral problem in the West,'' said the
minister, Barry Jones.
   The dispute recalls the 1960s debate over the insecticide DDT.
The West discovered it was harmful to both plants and animals and
imposed bans or restrictions in 1970-71 against the wishes of
developing nations, which feared a resurgence of disease-carrying
insects.
   Another environmental issue dividing the West from the Third
World is the dumping of toxic waste.
   President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya told the London conference
that recent dumpings in Africa of toxic chemicals from industrial
countries were ``unfriendly actions ... equivalent to declaring war
on the Earth's ecosystem.''
   On the ozone issue, developing countries demand Western help in
financing any switch from chlorofluorocarbons to safe substitutes.
   The chemicals, developed in the United States more than 50 years
ago as the working fluid for refrigerators, also are used in
aerosols, fast-food packaging and computer solvents. About 1.2
million tons are produced annually, more than 76 percent in the
United States and European Economic Community.
   When chlorofluorocarbons reach the stratosphere 15-25 miles up,
as much as 100 years after emission, they break apart and their
chlorine atoms deplete the ozone. Chlorofluorocarbons also trap
heat, increasing Earth's temperature in a process known as the
greenhouse effect.
   Washington now says it will ban all chlorofluorocarbons by 1999
if safe substitutes become available. The 12-nation EEC has agreed
to a similar timetable but its environment commissioner, Carlo Ripa
di Meana, wants an earlier target.
   Thirty-one countries have ratified the 1987 Montreal Protocol
requiring the amount of chlorofluorocarbons to be cut in half by
1999.
   Another 20 countries have agreed to sign up, but China, India and
Brazil, with rapidly growing populations, are not among them. They
have urged Western nations to create a fund to help them acquire
technology to replace chlorofluorocarbons, but insist the money not
be deducted from existing aid.
   ``Any reduction in these resources for whatever reasons would
mean that the poor of these countries will have to wait longer for
the promised freedom from hunger and poverty,'' said Z.R. Ansari,
India's environment minister. ``The poor are no more prepared to
wait, and there will be social upheaval if they are asked to wait
any longer.''
   China's environment commissioner, Liu Ming Pu, told the London
conference his nation of 1.1 billion people uses less than 2 percent
of the world's chlorofluorocarbons.
   Western nations say the potential for chlorofluorocarbons use in
the developing world is enormous and could wipe out any cuts made by
industrial countries.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Visits South Bronx Catholic School</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Parochial schools may have a friend in new U.S.
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, but he has made it clear that
probably won't sway him into recommending federal tuition tax breaks.
   Cavazos on Thursday visited St. Augustine School of the Arts, the
Roman Catholic grade school proclaimed as an educational oasis in
economically depressed South Bronx on CBS's ``60 minutes'' last
December.
   The school has been praised for its highly unusual curriculum
blending fine arts, especially music, with academic basics. But fame
has not brought fortune, and finances are so tight that ``at times
teachers have been asked not to cash their paychecks,'' said Father
Robert Jeffers, pastor of St. Augustine's.
   St. Augustine's, the only parochial school in the New York
archdiocese specializing in fine arts, admits all comers regardless
of potential talent, unlike most such schools.
   The school's 320 children in kindergarten through eighth grade
are required to study piano through at least fourth grade, and at
least another musical instrument thereafter.
   Cavazos lavished praise on St. Augustine and its mostly black
children. But he stopped short of holding out any promise of
financial relief.
   ``I think that any school that is well run, that is orderly, that
is free of drugs, all schools should be like that,'' Cavazos said.
   But, he said, ``I'm not really pushing for tuition tax credits or
vouchers.''
   ``I still am very optimistic,'' said principal Tom Pilecki. ``I'm
hopeful his visit here will help him see the strength of Catholic
schools. ... We don't have any money at all. We don't have a cent.''
   Tuition at St. Augustine's is only $1,100 a year. Teacher
salaries average just $17,000, half what New York City public school
teachers earn, Pilecki said. The 11 professional musicians and
artists who teach the school's special arts program average $13,000.
   The arts program is supported by about $350,000 a year in
foundation and corporate grants.
   William J. Bennett, Cavazos' predecessor, championed the cause of
parochial education. He pressed often, though unsuccessfully, for
federal tax breaks for parents paying private school tuition. And he
argued repeatedly that urban public schools could learn a lesson or
two from Catholic educators in preserving orderly schools.
   From the 1970s through 1984, enrollment at St. Augustine dropped
from about 500 to fewer than 200. The New York archdiocese was
considering shutting down St. Augustine's.
   But the school saved itself by devising an unusual curriculum
built around fine arts in the fall of 1984. Enrollment has since
rebounded to 320.
   The arts program has paid off, Father Jeffers said, because ``it
gives children a constant sense of accomplishment.''
   ``I would hope Cavazos would see some model here that could be
duplicated in other urban situations,'' said Jeffers.
   Cavazos also visited the Brooklyn campus of Long Island
University to help that school launch a new National Institute for
Hispanic Leadership. The institute's goal is to help Hispanic
youngsters gain leadership positions in the education field, and
eventually in other fields as well.
   ``Universities around this country must, I repeat must, recruit
more minority students,'' he said, and provide more scholarships for
such students.

<TEXT>
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani of
Iran said today that the only way to quiet Moslem furor over the
novel ``The Satanic Verses'' is to burn all copies of the book and
ban it forever.
   In the Malaysian city of Kota Bahru, an estimated 10,000 Moslems
burned U.S. flags and pictures of the book's author, Salman Rushdie,
during a protest against the novel.
   In Montreal, about 100 artists and writers gathered to criticize
the Canadian government for not reacting strongly enough to the
threats against Rushdie.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said Rafsanjani made his latest remarks about the book at the weekly
mass prayer sermon at Tehran University.
   ``If it stays, it will remain forever a source of rebellion and
it would be impossible that peace would come between real Moslems
and the supporters of this book,'' the news agency quoted him as
saying.
   ``The only solution that exists ... is to issue a strict order to
seize all copies in the world and burn it,'' Rafsanjani said.
   He said that stopping production of the book would be a retreat
from the West's claim that it was defending freedom of expression.
   But, Rafsanjani said, ``If those who ignited this flame do not
find a suitable solution, no one knows where it will lead to.''
   The parliament speaker said the issue had become ``the strangest
and rarest crisis in history.''
   Moslems say Rushdie's book blasphemes Islam by insinuating
Mohammed wrote the Koran himself rather than receiving it from God,
and by portraying Mohammed's wives as prostitutes.
   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a death
sentence against the author last month and has used the issue to
staunch the attempt lead by Rafsanjani to open Iran to more contacts
with the West.
   Fourteen Western nations summoned home their top diplomats from
Tehran to protest Khomeini's execution order.
   The author, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem family,
has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Iranian clerics offered a
$5.2 million reward for Rushdie's death.
   Most Middle Eastern nations have banned the book, as have Asian
states with sizable Moslem populations.
   The gathering in Malaysia was organized by the opposition Pan
Malaysian Islamic Party. Police were on hand and there were no
reported disturbances.
   Nik Aziz Mat, head of the party's Council of Theologians, urged
the group to put aside political differences and unite in their
opposition to the book. He said he supported the death threats
against Rushdie.
   In Montreal, the group of artists and writers urged Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney to sever diplomatic relations with Iran
until it rescinds its order to kill Rushdie.
   They also demanded that Canadians who make similar threats be
prosecuted.
   ``Notwithstanding the threats to Mr. Rushdie,'' said writer
Marguerite Corriveau, ``neither the prime minister of Canada or the
premier of Quebec has dared to speak out on behalf of our rights.
   ``When I hear so-called Canadians calling for Rushdie's death,
all I can say is that they're not part of my Canada.''

   Planners of the North Carolina Pickle
Festival have picked the perfect pair to pucker up at the annual
pickle party.
   Organizers, who wanted to add a new flavor to the festival with a
wedding, chose a Mount Olive couple who said they would be ``tickled
pickle green'' to plight their troth in front of thousands late next
month.
   A clever application and pickle industry connections led to
Timothy G. Gautier, 23, and Amy R. Smith, 19, said wedding committee
Chairwoman Lillian B. Langley.
   Gautier works at Charles F. Cates and Sons Pickle Co. and had
worked part-time at Mount Olive Pickle Co. _ the festival sponsors
and two of the nation's biggest pickle producers.
   Miss Smith, a community college student, works for her father's
restaurant that features burgers. ``This couple had said they had
stayed together `through pickles and hamburgers,''' Mrs. Langley
said.
   The two were chosen over five other couples, including some who
promised that their bridesmaids would carry cucumber vines or sprigs
of dill.

   A proposal to turn the water tower
in this Florida resort community into a 10-story pink flamingo has
laid an egg.
   The Santa Rosa Island Authority rejected the idea, dubbed
``Project Pink,'' and a motion to send the plan back to a committee
that endorsed it last week failed. No further action was taken.
   Some local merchants had hatched the proposal to create a local
landmark that could bring attention and tourists to the area, but
authority members said it would only make Pensacola Beach a
laughingstock.
   ``We're afraid publicity we could get would be publicity we don't
want,'' said David McDonald, president of the Pensacola Beach
Chamber of Commerce.
   The authority received a petition signed by 63 residents who were
``opposed to this monstrosity.''
   ``I really thought it was an early April Fool's joke,'' said
Eloise Gann, who presented the petition.
   Supporters were disappointed with the decision on Wednesday but
vowed to keep fighting for the big bird.
   ``They say flamingos are not indigenous to Pensacola Beach but
neither are tourists,'' said Ross Orenstein, general manager of Sun
Ray Cottages.

<TEXT>
   Four senior Scottish police officials are visiting
some families of the 259 victims of the Lockerbie plane disaster to
clear up what they consider a misunderstanding about victims'
belongings.
   The officers from the Dumfries and Galloway police forces will
visit several U.S. cities and talk to relatives who have complained
that the police have been slow in releasing the personal effects of
those who died in the December terrorist bomb blast aboard the Pan
Am jet.
   ``I lost a 16-year-old daughter and she had four suitcases with
her, almost everything she owned,'' said Paul Hudson, an Albany,
N.Y., lawyer who formed the 300-member relatives support group,
Victims of Pan Am 103. ``She had her Christmas presents with her.
Many of our memories of her were with her on that plane.''
   Only five or six relatives of the victims have received any
possessions, Hudson said.
   ``It's the last thing they have to remember their sons and
daughters,'' said North Adams Mayor Jim Barrett, who represented
several western Massachusetts families after the crash. ``Rings,
bracelets, it would mean so much to them to get them back.''
   The British policemen arrived in Boston Wednesday night and flew
to Washington Thursday to meet with U.S. State Department officials.
   ``We feel that to try to ease the frustrations of the relatives
here we should come personally and explain to various groups of
relatives exactly what the position is,'' Assistant Chief Constable
Paul Newell told British television before he left for the United
States.
   A letter of concern from the families that was sent to Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher last month may have resulted in the
officers' visit, said Hudson.
   ``It's a very emotional time,'' said Joe Horgan, whose
brother-in-law was on Flight 103. ``The additional trauma of not
having things returned means that the healing process cannot hit
full stride.''
   But Horgan, a member of the relatives group in charge of property
return, said the families are not angry with Scottish officials.
Horgan, who has visited police in Lockerbie, said Scottish law
differs from American law and authorities there did not want to
release what they consider evidence into a criminal investigation.
   He said the families became upset after receiving a letter from a
U.S. State Department official last month that hinted that some of
the victims' luggage and clothing might be destroyed.
   Horgan said ``all sorts of rumors and innuendo started after
that'' but it was found later to be false. Scottish authorities
``have been very sensitive to our needs,'' he said.
   The Scottish police met with State Department officials Thursday
to work out details of the visits, said department spokeswoman
Frances Jones.
   ``We will be accompanying them and making ourselves available to
family members for any questions they might have of us,'' she said.
   The Scottish policemen will meet with families in New York on
Saturday and in Boston on Sunday, travel to Detroit on Monday and
see families in Canton, Ohio, Tuesday.
   Police recovered more than 11,000 items of property scattered
over an area of 845 square miles.

<HEAD>Ban on Singers Mars City's Grand Latin Festival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A festival that was supposed to show this city's
Latin community at its party-giving best has erupted into a bitter
dispute over a ban on three singers who once performed in Cuba.
   On Thursday, The Miami Herald announced it was pulling out of the
Calle Ocho festival because the event's sponsors, the Little Havana
Kiwanis Club, canceled the scheduled appearance of the
Espanolisimos, a Spanish singing duo.
   Reflecting the city's fervently anti-communist Cuban community,
the Kiwanis Club has banned whoever has performed in Cuba since
Fidel Castro's government took over the island in 1959.
   The singing duo, initially hired by the Kiwanis Club, had been
scheduled to sing on a Herald-sponsored stage during the weekend
festival, which is expected to attract a million visitors.
   But earlier this week, the club discovered that one of the
Espanolisimos singers, De Raymond, performed in a Cuban festival in
1970.
   ``Everybody's in a very tough situation, and we are in a position
that we cannot change our policy,'' said architect Willy Bermello, a
former Kiwanis president. ``We are sorry that a political issue has
made a musical event into a political event.''
   In the past two weeks the club has also barred Puerto Rican salsa
singer Andy Montanez because he sang in Cuba in 1980, and
Mexico-based Brazilian singer Denise De Kalafe, who accepted an
invitation from her own government to perform in Cuba in 1981.
   All three singers have declared their opposition to Cuba's
communist government, but the Kiwanis Club has refused to budge.
   Roberto Suarez, associate publisher of the Herald, said the club
rule made it impossible for the newspaper to continue its
sponsorship of the festival.
   The newspaper ``should not be part of something where there is
censorship, which goes against the First Amendment,'' Suarez said.
   Even within Miami's Cuban community, there are sharp differences
over the policy.
   Tomas Garcia Fuste, executive news director of WQBA-AM and one of
Miami's best-known commentators _ as well as a vociferous
anti-communist _ has criticized the Kiwanis policy.
   ``Just because they went to Cuba is not a reason to not let them
perform,'' Fuste said. ``If they make any pro-Castro statements,
then they should be banned. But not just because they went there.''
   For De Raymond, the ban is particularly painful. He was barred
from Spain's Socialist Party-run television for six years, he said,
because of his strong anti-communist views. He even received death
threats from leftists, he said.
   ``Not only should I not be banned, but _ and I've never said this
_ I deserve a tribute, not a ban,'' De Raymond said.
   Calle Ocho _ or Eighth Street in Spanish, referring to the main
street of Miami's Little Havana _ has grown more popular each year
since it began in 1978. It now attracts sponsors and acts from all
over the Latin world, as well as tens of thousands of tourists.

reported at Bellingham, Wash. A wind advisory remained in effect for
interior sections of northwest Washington.
   Cloudy skies prevailed from the northern Rockies through the
northern and central Plains to the upper Great Lakes and western
sections of the Ohio Valley. Skies were also cloudy over the Florida
Peninsula.
   Today's forecast called for rain in the Northwest, central
California and northeast Florida.
   Highs were expected in the upper 40s in northeast Florida; 30s
and 40s from the middle and north Atlantic Coast states across most
of the Great Lakes region to Minnesota; 70s along sections of the
Gulf Coast; 70s and 80s over the southern Plains and southern Rockes

   Chinese troops rounded up suspected separatists
and kept a tight lid on Tibet today as the embattled region marked
the 30th anniversary of a failed attempt to cast off Chinese rule.
   Police and the military already had detained many Tibetans in
house-to-house searches and planned to move swiftly to crush any
demonstrations to commemorate the anniversary, according to Tibetan
and foreign sources.
   A Tibetan woman, contacted by telephone today, said the capital
was calm and that the army occupied all roads.
   ``There are new arrests ... There are many, but we don't know how
many,'' she said.
   A man came on the line.
   ``Don't talk a long time,'' he said. ``There are a lot of police.
We can't talk long.''
   China imposed martial law in Lhasa on Tuesday to quell three days
of anti-Chinese riots that took 16 lives, according to official
count. Western travelers say most Tibetans put the death toll at
between 20 and 30. Some estimates ranged much higher.
   All foreign tourists were ordered to leave Lhasa by Thursday. It
was believed the last group departed this morning.
   Another Tibetan woman reached by telephone Thursday evening from
Beijing said Chinese troops began rounding up large numbers of
Tibetans after most foreigners left.
   China's national radio today said large groups of protesters
turned themselves in and that police said those who gave themselves
up would be treated with leniency.
   It said some shops had reopened in the mountaintop city of
70,000, and the Barkhor, the central marketplace, was returning to
life.
   During the riots that began Sunday, mobs of Tibetans demanding
independence from China and chanting loyalty to their exiled
spiritual leader the Dalai Lama threw stones, ransacked
Chinese-owned shops, set fire to Chinese property and attacked
government office buildings.
   The Dalai Lama spoke today to about 5,000 ethnic Tibetans in
Dharmsala, India, who gathered to mark the 1959 uprising. He urged
Tibetans to demonstrate against Chinese rule but avoid violence.
   ``The non-violent struggle is the best because of the recent
events,'' he said. ``Have faith in the struggle and continue
demonstrations so that the world will know Tibet is suffering under
Chinese rule.''
   He called on Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to end violence in the
Tibetan capital, according to a statement issued by his headquarters
in New Delhi.
   ``I urge your personal intervention for bringing an immediate end
to the repressive measures against innocent Tibetans and lifting of
the martial law in Lhasa,'' the statement said.
   Thousands of Tibtetans also demonstrated in New Delhi and the
Indian city of Madras today.
   China's leading newspaper today issued a plea for calm and said
that without stability, economic reforms would fail.
   ``The riots in Lhasa ... show how precious stability is to the
(economic) modernization and how important it is for the peace and
happiness of the people. Without stability, nothing will be
accomplished,'' said the front-page editorial in the People's Daily.
   For the Chinese, the March 10 anniversary marked the beginning of
``democratic reform'' in Tibet, the institution of Communist
political and economic systems in the remote Himalayan region.
   Tibetans remember the day in 1959 when tens of thousands
converged on the Dalai Lama's palace to prevent what they thought
was a Chinese military attempt to kidnap their god-king.
   A week later, the Chinese allegedly fired two mortar shells into
the palace ground, and the Dalai Lama and his family fled secretly
that night, eventually reaching India. The Dalai Lama and about
100,000 followers now reside in exile in northern India.
   Following the Dalai Lama's flight, the Chinese army moved in to
destroy the Tibetan resistance, killing hundreds, perhaps thousands,
before order was restored.
   China says Tibet has been part of its territory for seven
centuries. Many Tibetans say their land was independent before the
Red Army moved into it in 1950, and they seek a sovereign state
under the Dalai Lama.
   The 53-year-old Dalai Lama, worshiped as a reincarnation of past
Dalai Lamas, has offered to accept Chinese control over Tibet's
defense and foreign policy in exchange for greater autonomy.
   China rejects the proposal but says it is willing to talk to the
Buddhist leader.

<HEAD>Guccione Says Former Penthouse Pet Turned Back on Career</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note contents</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 36-year-old woman who claims Penthouse
publisher Bob Guccione ruined her acting career by putting her in a
pornographic film is asking a court to award her $10 million in
damages.
   The former model, Anneka DiLorenzo, says Guccione reneged on a
verbal contract to help her career.
   But Guccione defended himself in state Supreme Court Thursday by
arguing that Ms. DiLorenzo got the exposure she needed but ruined
her own career by rejecting three movie offers and disappearing with
a boyfriend.
   ``She simply turned her back on us and went off to Florida in a
drunken spree'' in 1978, Guccione said. He testified he urged Ms.
DiLorenzo to sign a management contract with Penthouse in 1973 and
to let him guide her career.
   Ms. DiLorenzo said in court papers that Guccione was a ``sadistic
evil person'' who ruined her career by putting her in ``Caligula,''
a film loosely based on the life of the mad Roman emperor.
   The two-hour, 23-minute movie, which features bloody tortures and
hard-core sex of almost every variety, includes an explicit sex
scene involving Ms. DiLorenzo and another woman.
   The movie was shown to Justice Elliott Wilk, who is hearing the
trial without a jury. ``Does this movie ever end?'' he asked at one
point.
   ``It kind of makes you appreciate Pee Wee Herman, doesn't it?''
Wilk said.
   When the sex scene featuring Ms. DiLorenzo appeared on the
screen, she fled the courtroom in tears and remained in the women's
restroom for more than 30 minutes.
   Ms. DiLorenzo said Guccione fired her in 1980 when she refused to
accompany him to Japan on a promotional tour for the movie. She said
he had promised her that in return for her years of cooperation with
the magazine, she would always be ``part of his Penthouse family.''
   Penthouse's lawyer, Jeffrey Daichman, said Ms. Lorenzo admits she
has no proof that Guccione ever made such a promise.
   In her deposition, Ms. DiLorenzo said: ``I don't have any written
contracts with Guccione. He and I had verbal agreements. We were
partners in life.''

   A nursing supervisor at the hospital early today told The

treated there.
   Stallone recently started shooting a movie, ``Maverick@The

<TEXT>
   Canada's transport minister has ruled out holding a
special judicial inquiry into the cause of the 1985 Newfoundland
airplane crash that killed 256 Americans.
   The Canadian Aviation Safety Board concluded in a report last
year that the disaster was caused by ice on the wings of the Arrow
Air DC-8.
   However, four of the board's nine members cite evidence of a bomb
or fire that they believe may have been the work of terrorists.
   They have pushed for a new investigation, but Transport Minister
Benoit Bouchard rejected their demands Tuesday. ``We don't have any
reason to believe that (an explosion) happened,'' he said.
   He said no compelling reasons were found to question the majority
report.
   The plane went down shortly after a refueling stop at Gander. It
was carrying 248 soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division to their
home base in Fort Campbell, Ky. Everyone on board, including eight
crew members, was killed.
   It was Canada's worst air disaster.

<TEXT>
   Delegates from 30 nations have
drafted a plan asking Vietnam to curtail the exodus of boat people
from its shores, officials at the international conference said.
   However, the group, which ended a three-day meeting Thursday,
ruled out forcibly repatriating asylum-seekers who cannot show they
are fleeing political persecution, officials said.
   The delegates laid out the measures in a draft plan for
consideration at the International Conference on Indochinese
Refugees in Geneva in June.
   Chairman Majid Mohamed told a news conference the plan would help
``provide durable solutions to the Indochinese refugee problem.''
   The draft plan suggests Vietnam launch a campaign stressing the
risks and hardships of fleeing by boat and work to end illegal
departures by boat people. It also calls on Vietnam to make legal
departures easier.
   Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and other
countries in the region have agreed to provide only temporary asylum
for refugees. Western nations were urged to take in refugees left in
camps in Southeast Asia.
   Officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the conference
voted not to recommend a deadline by which those seeking asylum
would be screened to decide whether they qualified for resettlement
in the West.
   Officials said Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Australia, and some other Southeast Asian countries had
asked the conference to recommend forcible repatriation of boat
people and others fleeing their countries for reasons other than
political persecution.
   Vietnam, the United States, Sweden, the U.N. high commissioner
for refugees were among nations opposed tyo forced repatriation on
humanitarian grounds, said the officials.
   ``The rules are very clear ... whenever refugees are repatriated,
it has to be on a voluntary basis,'' said Jean Pierre Hocke, the
U.N. high commissioner for refugees.
   The officials said the Vietnamese delegation, led by Deputy
Foreign Minister Vu Khoan, had agreed at the conference to take back
anyone who wanted to return voluntarily.
   Western delegations present said they might take in additional
refugees and step up financial aid to help implement the plan.
   So far, 150,000 people have emigrated legally from Vietnam under
its Orderly Departure Program.
   There are about 300,000 Indochinese refugees in Southeast Asia.
About 1.5 million have been resettled since the outflow began 10
years ago, more than 800,000 of them in the United States, officials
said.
   Majid said the plan would be sent to U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar in New York for the Geneva conference June
13-14.

<HEAD>Court Revives Natives' Anti-Drilling Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has cleared the way
for native Alaskans to sue the government in their bid to stop the
offshore oil drilling they contend is destroying traditional hunting
grounds.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday ruled that the
``aboriginal'' rights the natives held in the submerged land, part
of the Bering Sea, were not destroyed by the 1971 Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act, which provided money to resolve all natives'
pre-statehood claims of rights in Alaska land.
   The 3-0 ruling means several hundred natives from the villages of
Gambell and Stebbins can try to prove that drilling in the federally
approved Lease Sale 57, made up of 2.4 million acres off Norton
Sound off Alaska's western coast, would hurt their ability to fish
and hunt for survival needs.
   However, the judges left open the question of whether a 1953
federal law that authorized offshore oil and gas leases had affected
the natives' offshore claims. That issue was returned to a lower
court.
   The natives have sued the Interior Department, contending that
its sale of leases violated their legal rights of subsistence
hunting and fishing on undersea federal land, between Alaska's
three-mile offshore boundary and the 200-mile federal limit.
   Carol Daniel of Alaska Legal Services Corp. said the natives have
hunted and fished on the ice ``since time immemorial,'' building
roads and making camps on the ice several miles offshore to catch
fish, walrus and whales.
   ``The drilling is so dangerous to resources and my clients are so
dependent on the resources,'' said Daniel, attorney for the
villagers. ``They don't have access to the same grocery stores (most
people do). The sea is their market.''
   E. Edward Bruce, attorney for five oil companies that hold leases
in the area, said no decision has been made on whether to appeal the
ruling.
   He said oil companies paid over $300 million for leases in March
1983 and completed exploratory drilling several years ago, but had
not done any drilling for oil production.
   Bruce said he had not been told the results of the exploratory
drilling, but he observed that ``the results were not sufficiently
promising to cause further exploratory drilling in the area.''
   The federal government in other cases has recognized native
Americans' aboriginal rights to follow age-old practices of hunting
and fishing for necessities on government land.

   An explosion ripped through the offices of
the Athens branch of the Banque Nationale de Paris early today,
causing extensive damage but no injuries, police reported.
   The 4 a.m. explosion sparked fires at shops adjacent to the
French-owned bank in the fashionable Kolonaki district of the
capital, police said.
   It took firefighters two hours to bring the flames under control
in the seven-story building where the bank is located. Windows in
nearby stores were shattered and at least four cars parked nearby
were damaged.
   Police said no organization immediately claimed responsibility
for the blast.
   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it
was one of the most powerful bomb blasts in recent times. ``I
presume (it) was set off by some Greek terrorist group,'' he said.
   Authorities said the blast was caused by a time bomb.
   Police said officials were surprised the bombers had specifically
singled out a French-owned bank for attack. However, leftist Greek
terrorist groups have bombed banks in the past.

   Uganda has denied Kenyan charges that one
of its airplanes bombed a Kenyan border village. Ugandan newspapers
today accused Kenyan soldiers of raiding a village across the border.
   The Ugandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday it had
sent no aircraft near the Kenyan border town of Lokichogio, where
Kenya said an Ugandan aircraft attacked on Tuesday. Kenya's Ministry
of Foreign Affairs sent Uganda a protest note Wednesday accusing
Uganda of the attack, which Kenya said killed five people and
injured four.
   The two sides also traded charges of cross-border cattle raids.
Tribal warriors on both sides of the border have traditionally
raided each other.
   The New Vision newspaper, quoting unidentified Ugandan officials,
said Kenya troop movements had been observed near the twin border
towns of Busia. The state-owned newspaper said troops dug trenches
around the airstrip there.
   ``Some Kenyan attackers wearing army uniforms and armed with guns
raided Bukwa in Kapchorwa district and stole cattle from residents
early this week,'' the independent Guide weekly newspaper reported.
   Kenyan and Ugandan security personnel in December 1987 traded
gunshots at Busia, 210 miles west of Kenya's capital, Nairobi. Kenya
admitted no loses on its side but claimed to have killed 20 Ugandans.
   Land-locked Uganda, which depends on Kenya for land transport to
the Indian Ocean, said three of its soldiers were killed in the
conflict.

cardiac arrest. He was 70.
   Beahan died a day after he underwent prostate surgery in a

   Beahan was the bombardier on the plane that dropped an atomic
bomb on Nagasaki, Japan, on Aug. 9, 1945, killing an estimated

   Beahan, a native of Joplin, Mo., attended Rice Institute, now
Rice University on a football scholarship and hoped to be a

   He joined the U.S. Army Air Corps, hoping to be a pilot, but
became a bombardier after washing out as a pilot candidate.
   Beahan retired from the U.S. Air Force as a lieutenant colonel in
1963 and worked for Brown &amp; Root Inc. as a technical writer until he

<TEXT>
   Iran reportedly hanged 81 drug smugglers
today, the highest daily toll since it began cracking down on
illegal drugs in January.
   The smugglers were convicted of possessing and selling heroin,
opium, hashish and other narcotics and were executed in Tehran and
26 other cities, Tehran radio said in a report monitored in Nicosia.
   Some also were convicted of theft, illegal possesion of arms,
kidnapping, and ``indecent acts in contravention to Islamic law,''
the radio said.
   The executions are part of a continuing crackdown on drug
addiction in Iran. Today's hangings bring to 356 the number of
executions reported by Iran since a new anti-drugs law went into
effect Jan 21.
   The previous high toll for one day was 70 executions on Feb. 14.
The new law carries the death sentence for possession of even small
quantities of drugs and gives addicts six months to kick the habit
or face jail terms.
   Earlier this week, the radio quoted an unidentified source at the
country's main law enforcement agency, the Komiteh, who said the
six-month grace period granted to addicts will expire July 23, after
which they will be prosecuted.
   The source said more than 50 tons of illegal drugs were seized
during a 12-month period ending March 21, the radio reported.

   The vehicle, with Vermont license plates, was parked at the gas

   A tough-talking President Bush brought his
anti-drug message to New York, a city where ``the war on drugs is no
metaphor.''
   Bush flew to New York Thursday to pay tribute to law enforcement
officers killed in the line of duty and met with the widow of a Drug
Enforcement Administration agent killed last week.
   Later in the day, Bush used an address to the United Negro
College Fund to repeat his anti-drug theme.
   ``My friends, drug abuse is America's 20th Century version of
human slavery,'' Bush said. ``It chains the spirit and imperils the
ability to learn.''
   He vowed to wage ``unconditional war'' against drug abuse and
said, ``We must fight on every front: education, treatment,
interdiction, enforcement.''
   In his speech at the DEA offices in Manhattan, the president
cited legislation passed by Congress last year providing the death
penalty for drug kingpins who commit murder while trafficking in
drugs.
   ``Just as the penalty for cop killers helps even the odds,
stripping our enemies of their ill-gotten gains turns the table in a
dramatic and highly effective way,'' he said.
   ``I have some bad news for the bad guys: Hunting season is over.
The rules on our side have changed too. It's about time.
   ``Here in New York City, as in other cities across the country,
the war on drugs is no metaphor,'' he said. ``Before we could bury
(DEA Agent) Everett Hatcher last week, another officer was gunned
down, felled by a single shot fired pointblank beneath his
bulletproof vest.''
   Bush, who headed a drug interdiction task force as vice
president, met with Hatcher's widow, Mary Jane Hatcher, just before
his speech.
   Bush, who has opposed strict gun controls and who has defended
the right of sportsmen and hunters to have semiautomatic rifles, did
say in his speech that he has asked William Bennett, his drug policy
coordinator, to ``look into what can be done to prevent fully
automatic assault weapons from falling into the hands of the
criminals you face.''
   On Feb. 9, Bush asked Congress for $5.5 billion for the war on
drugs, with the bulk of that going to law enforcement efforts,
including intensified border interdiction.
   At the same time, he is trying to put pressure on law enforcement
officials and leaders in other countries to staunch the flow of
drugs to the United States. Bush noted that he will soon receive a
report from Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on his just-completed
trip to Bolivia, Colombia and Peru.

<HEAD>Leftist Party Joins Social Democrats In West Berlin Coalition</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with business threatening to leave
city because of environmentalists. No pickup. ADDS byline.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A leftist party today agreed to join the Social
Democrats in forming a coalition government in West Berlin, a move
that businesses said could cause them to leave the divided city.
   The coalition of the left-leaning Social Democrats and the far
left Alternative List, the West Berlin equivalent of the anti-NATO
Greens Party, also has prompted Conservative West German politicians
from Chancellor Helmut Kohl on down to warn of dire consequences for
the city.
   Businessmen have opposed the Alternative List's insistence on
tighter environmental controls and claim the leftist group creates a
bad climate for investment. Some businessmen warned they may leave
the city, which had been dominated by Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union.
   The Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats won 55 seats
each in the West Berlin legislature in the Jan. 29 elections.
   The Alternative List won 17 seats and the far-right Republican
Party stunned many West Germans by winning 11 seats.
   After weeks of sometimes tense talks, negotiators for the two
leftist parties announced agreement on the details of the government
early today. The agreement was expected to win easy formal approval
from the full membership of both parties within days.
   The agreement outlined to the news media gives the Alternative
List three senators, who are the equivalent of Cabinet ministers in
other West German state systems. As a result, the far-leftists will
be in charge of programs for the environment, city development,
education, sports, families and youth.
   The Alternative List also has advocated more curbs on the police,
limits on motor vehicle use and more government-subsidized housing.
   Under the leftist coalition government, Social Democrat Walter
Momper will become the new mayor of West Berlin. He will replace
Eberhard Diepgen, whose Christian Democrats suffered severe setbacks
in elections on Jan. 29.
   The Christian Democrats had been actively promoting business
development in West Berlin to help end the isolation of the city 90
miles inside communist East German territory.
   The United States has promoted greater airline access to West
Berlin and has suggested that the city could be the site of U.N.
meetings as well as world conferences on human rights, arms control
and other issues.
   The far-right Republican Partym which has called for the ouster
of foreign workers and asylum seekers from West Berlin, is excluded
from the governing coalition.

<HEAD>Man Sprays In-Laws' House With AK-47 Fire, Kills Self</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man upset over his failing marriage set
his car on fire outside his in-laws' home, fired more than 50 rounds
from an AK-47 assault rifle at them and then killed himself, police
said.
   ``It was like something out of a movie,'' said police Maj. John
Wood. ``Like some Vietnam story.''
   Willie and Ella Mae West were uninjured in the shooting.
   Curtis Sanders, 31, came to the couple's house about 5:45 a.m.
Thursday but her husband didn't want to talk to him, Mrs. West said.
   ``We went back to bed, and then we heard shots ringing and glass
breaking,'' Mrs. West said. ``We were waiting and hoping he wouldn't
come in the door. He was tearing this house apart, and we knew he
wanted to kill us.''
   After firing from outside, Sanders shot the lock off the door and
entered the living room, firing bullets at waist level. He then
fired several shots through the bedroom wall amongst a row of
photographs of the Wests' children.
   None of the other portraits were hit, but a bullet passed through
the center of a picture of Brenda Sanders, his estranged wife. She
was not at her parents' home.
   Mrs. West dove to the floor and called police, as a bullet
slashed her pillow. Two holes were visible in the headboard on the
couple's bed. Another bullet ripped through a chair.
   West managed to grab his own shotgun _ with one shot in it _ from
the closet and fired at Sanders.
   ``Maybe that's what kept him from coming back here, that he knew
we had a weapon,'' Mrs. West said. West said he ducked back into his
bedroom and waited in terror for police to arrive.
   About five minutes after the shooting began, Sanders killed
himself near the front door, police said. He had two small-caliber
shots in his chest. Muscogee County Coroner J. Donald Kilgore ruled
the cause of death a suicide.
   Sanders had filled his pockets with ammunition and also took a
12-gauge shotgun into the house, police Lt. Robert Matthews said.
Investigators said 52 AK-47 bullets were fired.
   Mrs. Sanders said her husband was embittered at the Army for
giving him a dishonorable discharge, angry at the rest of the world
for not hiring him because of the discharge and embittered at his
in-laws for what he thought was interference with his dissolving
marriage.

<HEAD>Egyptian, Libyan Woman Appointed To Libyan Cabinet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya has announced changes in the government's
Cabinet that include the appointment of an Egyptian and the first
female minister.
   Libyan television and the official Libyan news agency JANA
Thursday reported the changes in the General People's Committee.
   The Cabinet spots are bureaucratic posts with little power. Col.
Moammar Gadhafi and a small group of close advisers run the country.
   Cabinet changes are announced each year at the annual meeting of
the General People's Congress, which consists of representatives of
the local grass-roots committees that make up the Libyan government.
   Jadallah Azzuz Al-Talhi will remain foreign minister, according
to the news reports, monitored in Rome.
   Umar Mustafa Al-Muntasir will remain prime minister _ or
secretary of the General People's Committee _ a post that does not
carry the influence it does in other countries.
   Libyan television said the Congress appointed an Egyptian, Amin
Halimi Uthman Kamil, as secretary of the General People's Committee
for Light Industries. The official Libyan news agency JANA said the
appointment demonstrated that Libya ``is the land for all Arabs.''
   Kamil was minister of light industry in Egypt under the late
President Gamal Abdul Nasser and since 1986 has worked as a
consultant to the Libyan Ministry of Industry, JANA said.
   The agency said Fatimah Abd Al-Hafiz Mukhtar became the first
woman appointed to a Cabinet post when she was named secretary of
the General People's Committee for Education.
   ``Such a step, the promotion of a woman to this popular position,
comes within the context of ... enabling woman to impose her will
and occupy her position in the people's administration,'' JANA said.

<TEXT>
   A comatose New York woman who received an
abortion after an emotional legal battle started an evaluation and
therapy program today at a rehabilitation center in this central New
Jersey community.
   ``We're committed to long-term care. ... We're talking months,
not weeks,'' said Dr. Keith D. Cicerone, clinical director of trauma
rehabilitation at John F. Kennedy Medical Center's Robert Wood
Johnson Jr. Rehabilitation Institute.
   Doctors will evaluate Nancy Klein and make an initial prognosis
on her condition in four to six weeks, Cicerone said. He declined to
give her condition or specific details of treatment, citing a
request by the family.
   Mrs. Klein has been comatose since suffering severe brain
injuries in a Dec. 13 automobile accident near her Long Island home.
She had been at North Shore Hospital on Long Island before being
transferred to the institute Thursday.
   Her husband, Martin Klein, went to court last month and won
guardianship of his wife so he could authorize the abortion. She was
17 weeks pregnant.
   Anti-abortion activists challenged the guardianship and appealed
to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case.
   In a lower court, doctors for both sides disagreed about whether
having an abortion could help Mrs. Klein recover.
   She could spend up to two years at the center, and then
additional years receiving out-patient treatment, Cicerone said. The
family was not present.
   Klein said in an interview that he told his wife not to be
scared, although he's not sure she understands. ``I told her we had
worked hard to get her into a place that will get her home faster,''
he said.
   Mrs. Klein's relatives said they have been encouraged by signs of
progress since the abortion on Feb. 11.
   Anne Zusselman, of Delray Beach, Fla., has said her daughter can
move her head to both sides, open her mouth and lift her left arm on
command.
   Doctors at North Shore continue to offer little hope for her
recovery.
   ``Doctors have seen a slight neurological improvement in Mrs.
Klein,'' said North Shore spokesman Daniel Rosette. ``They won't
predict her long-term prognosis, despite the slight signs of
improvement.''

underground, a mining company said today.
   Anglo-American Corp. said the fire broke out Thursday evening at

   Company spokesman Paul Clothier said two of the injured were in
serious condition and the remaining 20 were in a hospital under

   He said the cause of the fire was unknown and an investigation
would be conducted. The company did not immediately release the

   Radical students demanding better pay
and rights for workers battled police today in Seoul as thousands of
workers observed Korean Labor Day with nationwide rallies calling
for free union activity.
   Riot police fired tear gas to block 200 students from marching
off Joong-Ang University in southern Seoul.
   The students pelted police with rocks and lobbed firebombs at
them in fighting that lasted about 40 minutes. There were no
injuries or arrests.
   At peaceful rallies in Seoul and at least four other cities,
workers accused the government of siding with company owners and of
suppressing free union activity.
   About 10,000 workers affiliated with the Federation of Korea
Trade Unions gathered at a gymnasium in Seoul to urge the government
to ensure labor rights and better pay and working conditions.
   Labor unrest has plagued hudreds of companies this year, and
government officials predict more and longer labor disputes in April
and May.
   In the southeastern port of Ulsan, Hundai Heavy Industries Co.,
South Korea's largest shipyard, remained shut because of a bitter
labor dispute that began Dec. 12.

   A subway train carrying about 150 subway
passengers rammed into a work train today on Manhattan's upper West
Side, injuring 36 people and disrupting the rush hour for thousands
of commuters, authorities said.
   Though many of the passengers were hurled from their seats, none
of the injuries was considered life-threatening, said Transit
Authority spokesman Bob Previdi. Three people were taken to
hospitals and 33 were treated at the scene after the 5 a.m. accident.
   The accident happened when a southbound West Side local rammed a
revenue train that was stopped at the 103rd Street station. Previdi
said the revenue train travels from station to station collecting
money from the token booths. He estimated about 150 passengers were
aboard the local train and five or six Transit Authority workers on
the revenue train.
   He could not immediately say how fast the local train was
traveling at the time of the accident. The cause was under
investigation.
   Commuters faced extensive delays through the morning as a result
of the accident.

   The countdown began early today for a
Monday launch of space shuttle Discovery on a flight its commander
says will demonstrate ``we're a space-faring nation again.''
   The launch will be the third for the shuttle program since the
Challenger disaster more than three years ago, and the first of
seven flights scheduled this year as NASA moves toward its target of
safe, routine, once-a-month missions by 1992.
   ``The countdown started right on time,'' said NASA spokeswoman
Lisa Malone. The ambitious 1989 schedule is getting a late start,
with Discovery's flight delayed nearly four weeks so faulty or
suspect engine parts could be replaced.
   The countdown clock began ticking at 12:01 a.m. after test
conductor Jerry Crute issued the traditional call to stations that
summoned members of the launch team to their posts. The initial task
was to electrically activate the spaceship's systems.
   Charles Henschel, chief of test operations at the Kennedy Space
Center, told reporters today the early hours of the count had
progressed well and that some checks were running ahead of schedule.
   He reported gusty winds at Launch Pad 39B were delaying some
engine closeout and other work but that this should have no impact
on the countdown. He said the weather forecast for a Monday launch
was ``looking good.''
   Liftoff is set for 8:07 a.m. Monday.
   The five astronauts for the five-day mission were to arrive this
afternoon from their training base in Houston to make final flight
preparations.
   The commander, Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats, said in a recent
interview that the first two post-Challenger missions, flown
successfully last September and December, ``were important to show
that we could fly the space shuttle again after the catastrophe.
   ``The next step,'' he said, ``is to prove that we can do it on a
regular basis, that we're back in the business of space, to show
we're a space-faring nation again.
   ``It was very frustrating for us in the space program the last
three years to watch the Russians set new flight time records and do
all the things in space with their shuttle while we've been
grounded,'' Coats said.
   Flying with Coats will be Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, the
pilot; Marine Cols. James F. Buchli and Robert C. Springer, and Dr.
James M. Bagian, a medical doctor.
   Bagian and Springer are to release a $100 million Tracking and
Data Relay Satellite six hours after liftoff. The satellite is to
join two identical satellites to form a global network for
transmitting communications among ground stations, the shuttle and
several other satellites.
   Once the new satellite is operational, NASA will begin closing
down six of its shuttle ground stations.
   Following deployment of the satellite, the astronauts will settle
into four days of science and medical experiments.
   The Discovery is scheduled to touch down March 18 at Edwards Air
Force Base in California.

   George Miller couldn't believe his eyes when he
saw a painting of the Millersburg Ferry on the Susquehanna River
near his former home in Pennsylvania.
   A volunteer for Goodwill Industries, he bought the painting for
$12 as soon as the charitable organization began its annual art sale
last year. He was prepared to pay up to $100.
   But he and his wife, Ruth, couldn't believe their ears when they
found out how much the painting was worth _ $35,000 to $50,000.
   ``At first I just laughed about it,'' Mrs. Miller said Wednesday
as she and her husband helped set up this year's sale at the Arizona
State Fairgrounds. ``I thought it was funny. It took a little while
for it to set in.''
   The painting, signed by Ned Smith, a wildlife artist who died in
1985, features a stern-wheel ferry that has operated on the
Susquehanna for more than 150 years, with the central Pennsylvania
community of Millersburg in the background.
   ``I recognized it right away. It's about 20 miles from where we
were born and raised'' in Juniata County, said Miller, a retired
police officer.
   Last summer, an appraiser and the Pennsylvania Historical Society
for Fine Arts told the Millers what the painting was worth.
   Even though he knows he can get up to $50,000 for the painting,
Miller doesn't intend to sell it.
   ``Why sell it and have to give half the money to Uncle Sam?'' he
asked.
   Instead, he plans to loan the painting to the Pennsylvania
Historical Society for Fine Arts on a long-term basis.

<TEXT>
   A Swiss engineering company today said
it has cut its business links with a military-industrial complex in
Egypt that reportedly plans to build a plant to produce poison gas.
   The company said it believed the parts it shipped to Egypt would
be used to produce pharmaceuticals but that it severed its business
relationship with the Egyptian complex on the advice of the Swiss
government.
   The comment by Krebs A.G. followed a news report in The New York
Times today saying that U.S. officials believe Egypt is assembling
Swiss-made parts that could be used to create a chemical weapons
plant.
   The report, quoting Swiss and U.S. officials, said the Bush
administration hasn't decided how to respond to the reported
Egyptian plan.
   The Times said Krebs delivered to Egypt parts that will be
installed in a plant at Abu Zaabal, north of Cairo.
   But Mohammed Wahby, a spokesman for Egypt's Embassy in
Washington, denied Egypt plans to build a chemical-weapons plant.
``We are not involved in the manufacture of chemical weapons,'' the
Times quoted him as saying.
   The plant is part of a military-industrial complex that is also
scheduled to include someday a joint Egyptian-American plant for
assembling the M-1 tank, the newspaper said.
   An unidentified U.S. official told the Times the Bush
administration's efforts to stop the proliferation of chemical
weapons applies to all countries and not just those which have had
hostile relations with the United States.
   The administration official was quoted as saying the United
States has not decided how it will respond to the information about
Egypt, a nation that could play a key role in U.S. efforts to bring
a peace settlement to the Middle East.
   But the Times quoted another U.S. official as saying the United
States had recently told Egypt it was concerned about the project.
   The paper quoted a Swiss Foreign Ministry official as saying his
government had ``reason to believe'' the plant was intended to make
poison gas. It also quoted him as saying he would not provide
details because he had to protect intelligence sources.
   Kreb's president, Hans Rudolf Weber, told The Associated Press
today that the company cut ties to the military-industrial complex
in Egypt on the advice of the Swiss government. He would not
elaborate.
   Weber said Egyptian authorities told his company that the Abu
Zaabal plant would be controlled by the Health Ministry and would
produce pharmaceuticals. He said Krebs A.G. has supplied the plant
with parts since 1976 but has now halted all deliveries and also was
no longer sending any experts to Egypt.
   The state secretary in the Swiss Foreign Office, Klaus Jacobi,
sent a letter to Krebs last week demanding that the company sever
its relationship with the project, the Foreign Ministry official
said.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Palestinian Group Held Two American Diplomats In Syria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian group based in Syria detained two
American diplomats for more than eight hours before handing them
over to Syrian authorities, the State Department says.
   ``The two embassy officials were not harmed,'' press officer
Nancy Beck said Thursday, adding that the U.S. government filed a
protest with the Syrian government on Thursday over the March 3
incident.
   Ms. Beck said she didn't have the names of the U.S. officials.
   She said armed members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command stopped and detained the officials outside
the Damascus area, holding them ``for over eight hours'' until they
were turned over to Syrian authorities.
   ``The Syrian government immediately contacted the U.S. Embassy
and turned over our personnel to the embassy,'' Ms. Beck said.
   ``Today we are registering our strong protest of this incident to
the Syrian government, stressing that we hold it responsible for the
safety of our diplomatic personnel,'' she said.
   ``We once again urge Syria to take action against the PFLP-GC
terrorist group to insure that there is no repetition of such
incidents and that it end its activities,'' Ms. Beck said.
   ``Because the PFLP-GC is headquartered in Damascus, Syria must
bear responsibility for its actions,'' she said.
   The PFLP-GC is a faction formed by Ahmed Jibril, an officer in
the Syrian army, in 1968. Most of its attacks have been against
Israeli targets.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with new quotes from Clark and to CLARIFY
that suspension is due to begin Monday pending formal ratification of school
board later in the week. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PATERSON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Clark, the high school principal who
became famous for his no-nonsense discipline, has been ordered
suspended because he arranged a school assembly at which four
strippers performed, officials said.
   Thursday's action marks another episode in the turbulent tenure
of Clark at Eastside High School, part of which led to the new film
``Lean On Me,'' which depicts Clark as a well-intentioned
administrator whose tough tactics arouse controversy.
   The suspension was ordered by Paterson's superintendent of
schools, Dr. Frank Napier, according to Robert G. Rosenberg,
attorney for the board of education. The five-day suspension is due
to begin Monday.
   ``Dr. Napier has stated that Mr. Clark failed to supervise his
building on this particular day,'' Rosenberg said.
   The school assembly included an act by dancer Wanda Dee in which
she stripped male dancers down to their G-strings. School officials
on hand stopped the show right away. Rosenberg said there were at
least three male dancers.
   Clark was not at the school the day of the assembly last month
and has said he never expected the dance group he hired to lapse
into lasciviousness.
   He also called the school officials ``puritanical demagogues''
for taking action against him. In an interview Thursday with the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette before a speech at Slippery Rock University
of Pennsylvania, Clark said the suspension is to last five days ``if
the kids don't tear the building down.''
   ``I'm not questioning the inappropriateness of the act,'' he
said. ``But for them to get sanctimonious on me....''
   ``They were going to suspend somebody,'' he said. ``So I said,
`You want to suspend somebody, suspend me. I need a rest. I'm tired
and you're going to pay me.'''
   The suspension must be ratified by the school board, which will
meet Thursday. Rosenberg said Napier is empowered to suspend
employees in advance of formal ratification by the board, and he
said board members were likely told of Napier's decision before it
was announced. He also said Clark was not expected to fight the
suspension.
   In Paterson earlier Thursday, Clark, toting his trademark
bullhorn, led a group of more than 500 students across city streets
to the Board of Education offices to plea for more bilingual
teachers in the school system.
   Napier said he met with the students and discussed ways in which
he could recruit additional bilingual teachers.
   As a result of the meeting, a committee of school officials and
students will be formed to help recruit additional bilingual
teachers, Napier said.

   Sen. Sam Nunn, fresh from the bitter debate
over the nomination of John Tower to head the Pentagon, called today
for a cooling of ``the passions that are now bubbling in
Washington.''
   ``We cannot prevail as a great power if either our allies or our
adversaries look to Washington and see endless division and rancor
instead of a principled, unified American policy,'' said Nunn.
   As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Georgia
Democrat led the successful fight to defeat the Tower nomination.
   He struck a conciliatory note in a speech opening the annual
conference of the Democratic Leadership Council, an organization of
centrist Democrats who banded together four years ago to halt what
they saw as a leftward drift of their national party.
   The current chairman of the DLC, Nunn opened the meeting with a
grim message: ``In presidential elections, the Republicans are now
the de facto majority party.''
   Nunn cited what he called the successes of the DLC and said,
``Our progress has been overshadowed by a larger failure _ the
collective failure of Democrats to reverse our party's dismal record
in national presidential elections.''
   The Democrats have lost five of the last six presidential
elections.
   He went on to say that when legislative seats are realigned in
1991 to reflect populations shifts, the situation ``can only get
worse'' for Democrats.
   Census projections indicate a continued shift of House seats from
Northern industrial states to the Sunbelt, from traditionally
Democratic strongholds to areas of emerging Republican strength.
   Nunn came to the conference following the 53-47 Senate vote
rejecting President Bush's nomination of Tower. It was the first
time the Senate had turned down a nominee for a president's initial
Cabinet and it came after a bitter, often highly partisan debate.
   ``I hope the passions that are now bubbling in Washington will
soon cool,'' said Nunn, ``and we can get on with thr business of
forging a defense and foreign policy that is supported by the main
elements of both political parties.''
   Nunn went on to say that ``our nation cannot afford a separate
Dempcratic and Republican foreign policy on issues as important as
arms control, relations with the Soviet Union and the future of
Latin America.''

   March 10 has double significance for
James Earl Ray: it was 20 years ago today that he pleaded guilty to
killing the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and it's also his 61st
birthday.
   But no celebrations were planned by Ray, now a Brushy Mountain
State Prison inmate. He spent another day working in the prison's
laundry and continued to pass time on his 99-year prison term.
   ``This is a big holiday for prosecutors, judges and the media to
celebrate,'' Ray said in a telephone interview from the prison.
``Not me.''
   Former Shelby County District Attorney General Phil Canale and
his assistant, now Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Robert Dwyer,
don't have any parties planned either. Dwyer said he has only one
regret about that day.
   ``I was actually disappointed in the guilty plea, '' Dwyer said.
``There was no question that we would have been able to prove him
guilty if we had gone through a trial.''

<HEAD>Government Reverses Itself On Restoring Civil Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has reversed a decision
to restore full constitutional rights, which were suspended March 2
amid nationwide rioting and looting over austerity measures.
   Government spokesmen had promised that full civil rights would be
restored on Thursday. But the decision was revised to include only
freedom of speech, Interior Minister Alejandro Izaguirre said on
television Thursday night.
   ``The government considers it prudent to maintain the suspension
of some of the measures,'' Izaguirre said without elaborating.
   Under the suspension, authorities can continue to arrest people
without charges, enter homes at will, prohibit demonstrations and
public meetings and restrict freedom of movement.
   The military will continue to patrol the streets, Izaguirre said.
   University students protesting the latest austerity measure,
higher bus fares, began the week of violence Feb. 27. Authorities
say 256 people were killed and thousands injured in the rioting.
   Some observers say authorities fear there could be renewed
rioting when university classes resume Monday.

   Gregory Peck, who joked that he's
``entirely too young'' for the honor, was saluted by fellow Oscar
winner Jane Fonda and others as he received the American Film
Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award.
   Peck, 72, was honored at a tribute Thursday attended by scores of
Hollywood stars. The program will be telecast on NBC on March 21.
   ``You can never really go as far or go as deep as you would like
to,'' Peck told the audience. ``So there's always something else to
try for _ there's always a new challenge.''
   Peck's latest movie isn't even out yet _ ``Old Gringo,''
co-starring Miss Fonda and Jimmy Smits of ``LA Law.''
   ``I may not be his first leading lady or his last, but I
certainly got him at his ripest,'' Miss Fonda said.
   Audrey Hepburn, who co-starred with Peck in ``Roman Holiday,''
said, ``I've waited 37 years to say with all my heart and all my
love, `Thank you, Gregory Peck.'''
   Miss Hepburn was host of the event, which attracted such stars as
Lauren Bacall, Virginia Mayo, Dorothy McGuire, Liza Minnelli,
Jennifer Jones, Charlton Heston, Dinah Shore and Frank Sinatra.
   Mary Badham, who played Peck's daughter in the 1962 film ``To
Kill a Mockingbird,'' recalled that he immediately befriended her
when she arrived in Hollywood. She called him ``one of the kindest,
most gentle human beings in the world.''
   ``Mockingbird'' brought Peck an Academy Award as best actor for
his role as a Southern lawyer who defends a black man accused of
rape.
   ``It was his greatest role because he was so much like Atticus
Finch,'' Miss Badham said.
   Miss Bacall, who starred with Peck in the 1957 movie ``Designing
Woman,'' said she first met him when he was 17 years old.
   ``I thought he was the most gorgeous creature I had ever seen in
my life,'' she said. ``But it was 15 years before I made a picture
with him.''
   Angie Dickinson said she ran into one major problem when she was
asked to co-star in the 1963 film ``Captain Newman, M.D.''
   ``Universal Pictures told me I had to agree to a long-term
contract,'' she said. ``But they told me my co-star would be Gregory
Peck. I said, `What the hell? What's seven years?'''
   About 1,000 people attended the black-tie tribute at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel. Past recipients of the award include Orson Welles,
Bette Davis, James Cagney, Henry Fonda, Alfred Hitchcock, Jack
Lemmon and Barbara Stanwyck.

   The army withdrew troops today from crowded
areas of two of the largest refugee camps in the occupied Gaza Strip
in a plan that will put more paramilitary police and mobile units in
the volatile camps.
   Troops today began moving out of some posts in the Jabaliya camp,
which has 52,000 residents, and on Thursday began leaving the Shati
camp, where 42,000 Palestinians live, Palestinian witnesses and
Israel radio said.
   Israel radio said the soldiers would be replaced by mobile units,
deployed in less crowded areas, which could move quickly in case of
violence.
   Army officials said without eleaborating that the redeployment
was aimed at reducing casualties in the 15-month Palestinian
uprising.
   The total number of soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip will not
be cut, but many combat soldiers will be replaced by border police
trained in riot control, an army spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   The military moves came as Foreign Minister Moshe Arens left for
the United States on a 10-day visit. He is to meet with President
Bush and Secretary of State James Baker.
   Arens is expected to seek U.S. support for peace efforts that
focus on an interim solution for the occupied territories. U.S.
officials are expected to urge Israel to reduce the violence used in
suppressing the 15-month Palestinian uprising.
   At least 393 Arabs and 17 Israelis have died since the
Palestinian rebellion against Israeli occupation began in December
1987. The Israelis seized the lands from Arab neighbors in the 1967
Middle East War.
   The lastest death came Thursday when a 16-year-old Palestinian
was shot to death and 10 Arabs were wounded in clashes with Israeli
troops.
   Military officials believe removing permanently stationed units
from the camps will lower tension.
   ``The policy is now to reduce the hold, to reduce the friction
between Israeli forces and the local population,'' Southern
Commander Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai was quoted as saying in
independent Haaretz newspaper.
   He added, however, that the new mobile army units will be ready
to move ``to every place and at every moment to disperse
disturbances.''
   The army plan also calls for border police to relieve infantry
units in densely populated Gaza City and the refugee camps of
Nusserat and Bureij.
   Army spokesman Maj. Moshe Fogel said the deployment of
highly-trained border police will reduce the high number of
casualties in demonstrations.
   Elsewhere in Gaza today, the army destroyed rooms in the homes of
three Palestinians from the Khan Yunis refugee camp who were
suspected of throwing firebombs at Arab collaborators, an army
spokesman said.
   Palestinians shuttered their stores and transportation halted
around the strip on the second day of commercial strikes.
   A Palestinian human rights activist was freed from military
detention in Israel one day before Amnesty International USA named
him a ``prisoner of conscience.''
   Zahi Jaradat of Saaer, a village in the West Bank, was released
Wednesday after a year in administrative detention, said an official
at Al Haq-Law in the Service of Man, a human rights group.

<HEAD>Four Blacks Sentenced To Death For Killing Strikebreakers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four members of the black
transport workers union were sentenced to death today for killing
four black co-workers who refused to join a 1987 strike.
   Four more black members of the South African Railway and Harbor
Workers Union who also pleaded guilty to the same killings were
sentenced to prison terms of between eight and 12 years by
Johannesburg Supreme Court Judge T.T. Spoelstra, who cited
extenuating circumstances in their cases.
   According to evidence at the trial, many workers who refused to
join a strike against the state rail company in March and April 1987
were kidnapped and beaten at the Johannesburg headquarters of the
Congress of South African Trade Unions, a black labor federation.
The Railway and Harbor Workers Union is an affiliate of the labor
federation.
   Five employees who had defied the strike were beaten at the
federation building, then taken to an empty lot to be killed,
according to court testimony. One of the five escaped, while the
other four were stabbed and set afire, according to the testimony.
   The killings occurred April 20, 1987, near the end of a
seven-week strike by about 18,000 black rail workers against South
African Transport Services.
   Eight union members who pleaded guilty to charges of attempted
murder, assault, kidnapping and intimidation received suspended
sentences at the Supreme Court.
   The sentences followed a hearing that concluded Thursday on
whether there were extenuating circumstances. All 16 pleaded guilty
last year.
   The four men sentenced to death are: Wilson Matshili, 33, Patrick
Molefe, 27, Takalani Mamphanga 25, and George Maugedzo, 36. No
execution date was set.

<HEAD>Falwell Reaffirms That Ministry Employees Must Tithe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell today told the 2,000
employees of his religious empire that they will be required to be
members of his church and donate 10 percent of their income to it.
   ``We're not changing anything, we're just reinforcing what has
been a policy for two decades,'' the independent Baptist preacher
told workers for Liberty University, Old-Time Gospel Hour, Lynchburg
Christian Academy, Liberty Godparent Home, Liberty Broadcasting
Network and Thomas Road Baptist Church.
   ``The purpose of this is not numbers and money, but coordination
of vision and teamwork,'' Falwell said.
   Falwell spokesman Mark DeMoss did not immediately return a
telephone inquiry about the timing of Falwell's statements. But the
action was announced shortly after Falwell unveiled more detailed
plans for a new $30 million 10,000-seat church near the Liberty
Univerty campus. The new facility won't be ready until at least
1991, Falwell said.
   Falwell said all full-time workers at his ministry will be
subjected to the tithing policy as of July 1. The policy falls
within the limits of the law as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme
Court in a Mormon case, Falwell said.
   But he said the workers should be motivated by faith into tithing.
   ``If this is something you in your heart can't do, it would be
better for you to not be a member of this team, rather than be
forced to serve God here,'' Falwell said.
   Falwell said some exceptions will be approved. For example, some
teachers at his schools are pastors of their own churches; they have
been exempt from the church membership and tithing policies in the
past.
   ``We're not talking about Gestapo methods,'' Falwell said. ``But
we cannot move ahead without getting our camps together, and this is
the year we're doing it. I felt the need to once again verbalize the
vision.''
   If all Falwell employees tithe 10 percent, it will balance the
books of Thomas Road Baptist Church, he said.
   The 33-year-old ministry has a $35 million payroll and a church
budget of $3.5 million, exactly 10 percent of the payroll, Falwell
said.
   Before today's meeting, ministry officials said, tithing and
church membership were required of employees of Liberty University
and Liberty Christian Academy.

   The judge in Fawaz Younis' hijacking trial
today gave the jury stern instructions that seemed to undercut the
defendant's argument that he was justified in taking over an
airliner in Beirut in 1985 because he was under orders from a
Lebanese militia.
   ``Orders to hijack a plane ... are illegal orders,'' U.S.
District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. told the jury of seven women
and five men. ``Obedience to illegal orders is no defense.''
   The judge said Younis should be acquitted only if he did not know
that hijacking was illegal.
   Younis has testified that he knew that hijacking was illegal in
peacetime, and that the Amal militia to which he belonged was not at
war with Royal Jordanian Airlines, the government of Jordan, the two
Americans aboard the aircraft or any of the other 70 passengers and
crew members.
   Younis, 30, has pleaded innocent in the case, which is a test of
a 1984 statute asserting ``long-arm'' U.S. jurisdiction in cases
involving American hostages taken overseas.
   Federal prosecutors sought to convince jurors that Younis knew he
was committing an illegal act against innocent civilians by seizing
control of Royal Jordanian Flight 402 on June 11, 1985.
   In his closing argument Thursday, defense attorney Francis D.
Carter urged the jurors to put aside their preconceptions of
hijacking as they decide the fate of Younis, a member of Lebanon's
Amal militia, a Shiite Moslem group.
   ``It's not the bogyman that you thought _ the word hijacking,''
Carter said.
   If convicted of the six counts against him, Younis could face
life in prison plus more than $410,000 in fines, which he does not
have money to pay. He has been held in isolation since his arrest
September 1987 and is represented by court-appointed counsel.
   Carter, in his final presentation, recounted the civil war that
has engulfed Lebanon since 1975 and tried to convince the jury that
Younis felt compelled to obey the orders from Amal, virtually the
only authority in West Beirut where the lived.
   ``The difficulty that you have is to take American law ... and
put that on top of the facts in Lebanon,'' Carter said. ``You have
to understand what this man had been through,'' Carter said.
   Federal prosecutors J. Ramsey Johnson and Karen Morrissette, in
their closing arguments, reminded they jury of testimony by Younis
that Amal was not at war with the American, Jordanian and Lebanese
passengers aboard the aircraft, nor against the government of
Jordan, which owns the airline.
   Hijacking, said Morrissette, ``is a violation of international
law.''
   ``The defendant cannot hijack an airplane, then come into a
courtroom in this country and say, `Well, someone told me to do it,'
and it's all right,'' she said.
   The prosecution also reminded the jury of testimony from five
eyewitnesses who identified Younis in the court room and recounted
how the hijackers stormed aboard the plane armed with AK-47 assault
rifles and hand grenades and tortured nine Jordanian sky marshals.

<HEAD>FBI Director Says Semiautomatic Rifles Have Destructive Impact on
Society</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI Director William Sessions today said
semiautomatic assault rifles have a ``very destructive impact'' on
society but declined to say whether they should be banned.
   During a meeting with reporters, Sessions said the question of
whether to ban assault weapons like the AK-47 Soviet-style rifle
that was used by a gunman to kill five California school children
required a political judgment he wouldn't make.
   ``It's not my responsibility to make that kind of decision,''
Sessions said.
   But the FBI director said ``the presence of these weapons does
have a very destructive impact on American society and the people.''
   ``Tragedy after tragedy flows from it,'' Sessions said. ``People
and law enforcement officers are victims of these crimes.''
   ``I am sorry we are outgunned and outmanned in that respect,''
the director said, echoing sentiments of many local law enforcement
officials who have asked Congress to ban semiautomatic assault
weapons such as the Soviet AK-47.
   President Bush has resisted calls to ban the weapons that were
made in the wake of the Jan. 17 shooting at a Stockton, Calif.,
elementary school where five children died when a gunman sparyed
them with more than 100 rounds from a Soviet-style AK-47 rifle.
   But Bush, a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association,
said earlier this week that he wants to find a way to prevent the
criminal use of these weapons while doing ``what's right by the
legitimate sportsman.''
   Bush said he has directed drug-czar-designate William Bennett to
study the proliferation of the semiautomatic weapons.
   Critics say the guns can be easily altered to make them automatic
despite legal prohibitions on such weapons.
   Sessions, meanwhile, defended the FBI's background investigation
of former Texas Sen. John Tower, whose nomination as defense
secretary was rejected Thursday by the Senate.
   ``The bureau carried out its function in this case as I'm sure it
did in hundreds of other cases,'' Sessions said, adding he saw ``no
need to change at all'' the FBI's procedures for conducting
background checks on Cabinet nominees.
   Some senators have criticized the bureau as helping spread
innuendo and rumors in its investigation of Tower, whose drinking
habits, relationships with women and financial ties to the defense
industry came under fire.
   Floyd Clarke, the bureau's director of investigations, said the
FBI is careful to verify derogatory allegations made about a
nominee, including questioning the individual about the charges.
   Sessions, who personally removed himself from the Tower case
because of his past political ties with the former senator, said the
White House had not criticized the FBI's handling of the
investigation.
   Sessions said he intended to serve out his 10-year term as FBI
director. The director said reports that Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh was trying to remove him were ``as much a surprise to me
as anyone.''
   ``I intend to serve out... my full term,'' Sessions said.
   But Sessions acknowledged that he had stopped meeting informally
with members of Congress at FBI headquarters, a practice which
reportedly drew objections from Thornburgh.
   ``I see the attorney general of the United States as the person
for whom I work at the Department of Justice,'' Sessions said. ``I
agree fully with his one-voice concept,'' he said, referring to
Thornburgh's repeated injunction that the department ``speak with
one voice.''

<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Vere Bird won a fourth
straight term in office, but the opposition broke the governing
party's virtual monopoly of the 17-seat Parliament by winning two
seats, officials said today.
   Bird's Antigua Labor Party captured 15 seats in Thursday's vote,
losing one seat from Antigua to the opposition United National
Democratic Party.
   The seat allotted to the sister island of Barbuda, previously
held by Eric Burton, an independent allied with the governing party,
was won by the opposition Barbuda People's Movement.
   Members of the governing party drove around this tiny eastern
Caribbean country this morning with loudspeakers thanking their
supporters for returning them to office.
   ``The people of Antigua and Barbuda today celebrated in the glory
of our democratic process and must be congratulated for their
efforts,'' said Lester Bird, son of the prime minister and chairman
of the Labor Party.
   Bird, 78, first came to power in 1976. He owes his popularity
largely to the country's booming tourism industry, low unemployment
and one of the most prosperous economies in the region.
   Thursday's vote was the second since Antigua became independent
from Britain in 1981. The country had been semi-independent since
1967.
   The Antigua Election Office released the results early today. It
did not disclose the number of votes cast or the turnout. There were
36,504 eligible voters, from a total population of 100,000.
   Opposition parties had accused the government of corruption and
blamed it for running up a $250 million foreign debt.
   Bird said the debt was necessary to improve roads and ports to
stimulate tourism, which earned the island $189 million in 1987.

   A fight erupted at a rally for Republican mayoral
nominee Edward Vrdolyak after a handful of hecklers booed the
candidate and his supporters responded by throwing punches.
   Vrdolyak blamed his Democratic challenger, Richard M. Daley, but
Daley supporters suggested Thursday night's fight was a set-up
crafted by Vrdolyak himself.
   The fight was over in about a minute and there were no arrests.
   ``We knew Daley would resort to this,'' Vrdolyak told the crowd
at a Northwest Side hall. ``We must be winning. They want to throw
the place up for grabs.''
   Countered Daley spokesman Avis LaVelle: ``If Vrdolyak thinks
these people were hired by the Daley campaign, it is more likely
that he or someone in his campaign hired them so they could blame it
on the Daley campaign.''
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer, who was defeated by Daley, the Cook County
State's Attorney, in the Feb. 28 mayoral primary, was courted
privately earlier this week by both Daley and Alderman Timothy
Evans, who bypassed the primary to run as an independent in the
April 4 special election.
   Sawyer delayed an announcement on an endorsement until next week,
but said he probably will remain neutral.
   The April 4 election will choose a successor to serve out the
final two years of Mayor Harold Washington's second term. Washington
died of a heart attack in November 1987.

<HEAD>Bush Will Propose Legislation to Limit Exports of Hazardous Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today announced he will propose
legislation to halt exports of hazardous waste unless there is an
agreement that the receiving country will handle the material in an
approved, safe manner.
   The president's proposal would involve waste that U.S. industry
ships for disposal in other countries. Concerns have been raised by
environmentalists that some countries, particularly in the
developing world, do not regulate disposal and handling of such
wastes in an environmentally safe manner.
   Bush, in remarks at the swearing-in cermony for Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, said he would send legislation to
Congress to empower the United States to block exports by U.S.
companies unless safety can be ensured through a bilateral pact.
   The legislation ``will give the U.S. government the authority to
ban all exports of hazardous waste except where we have an agreement
with the receivng country providing for the safe handling and
management of those wastes,'' he said.
   ``We're determined to work with other concerned governments to
exercise wide stewardship over our environment, particularly where
matters of health are concerned,'' Bush said.
   The legislation Bush proposes would affect any U.S. companies
that export hazardous waste rather than dispose of it in the
approved domestic sites, said Linda Fisher, assistant Environemental
Protection Agency director for policy.
   She said most U.S. exports go to Canda and Mexico, where other
companies that deal in waste receive it. In Mexico, some handlers
use the waste in recycling efforts, she said.
   Most of the countries that have caused concern are third world
nations, she said.
   ``Under current law, the United States has to notify another
country that hazardous waste is being shipped to them. We don't have
any mechanism to make sure it is being handled properly in other
country,'' she said.
   Bush's proposed bill would ensure that companies only ship to
countries that have a bilateral agreement with the United States to
make sure it is handled in a manner that does not endanger health
and the environment.

   Dr. Louis Sullivan said today that under his
tenure, the Department of Health and Human Services will have a
``human face ... a gentle touch.''
   At his formal swearing-in ceremony attended by President Bush,
the new HHS secretary pledged to find better ways to serve the
nation's poor, continue research towards a cure for AIDS, help rid
the nation of drug abuse, develop preventive health strategies and
maintain the Social Security and Medicare programs.
   ``Health and Human Services is the hub of a vast wheel whose
spokes radiate out to touch all Americans,'' Sullivan said. ``During
my tenure, the offices of the department will have a human face, the
regulations promulgated will carry a gentle touch.''
   Sullivan is a personal friend of Bush and his wife, Barbara, who
also attended the ceremony. Mrs. Bush is on the board of trustees of
the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, which Sullivan founded
and served as president. While at HHS, Sullivan, a blood specialist,
is on an unpaid leave from the school as a professor of medicine.
   Bush said Sullivan has his ``complete confidence and my full
support'' at the helm of the department that spends the largest
portion of the federal budget and ``affects the lives of every
American.''
   Sullivan was sworn in right after he was confirmed by the Senate
last week. Today, he took the oath again in a formal ceremony before
several hundred supporters, department employees, members of
Congress and administration officials.
   Sullivan was joined on the podium by his wife, Ginger, and two
sons and daughter. His son, Halsted, a senior at the University of
Virginia, sang ``The Star Spangled Banner.''

<TEXT>
   As many as 115 coastal homes and
structures along the Outer Banks island chain have been destroyed or
damaged by three days of high waves spawned by a storm drifting
slowly out to sea.
   ``I got to laugh to keep from crying,'' said Kitty Hawk resident
Joseph Verscharen as he and his wife, Janet, surveyed the damage to
their oceanfront lot Thursday. ``This was our castle.''
   About 10 feet of their cottage hung over a 6-foot cliff where the
ocean had eroded more than 75 feet of beach and a protective dune
the Verscharens built after storm damage last April.
   Thursday night, officials opened a shelter at Kitty Hawk
Elementary School for oceanfront residents fearing the abnormally
high tides and 15-foot waves.
   Meanwhile, five traffic fatalities and two deaths from
hypothermia were linked to slick roads and cold weather over the
past three days.
   In addition to buildings damaged or destroyed, scores more are
threatened from Sandbridge in Virginia Beach south through the Outer
Banks chain of barrier islands off the North Carolina coast.
   On Hatteras Island, three neighboring motels in Buxton were
endangered when the morning's high tide breached a protective dune.
Residents fighting 45 mph wind and a sleet storm pitched in to fill
sandbags by hand, while bulldozers pushed up sand to rebuild the
dune line.
   ``Whatever we do have left, it will be because the people of
Hatteras came to help. It's something I'll never forget,'' said
Carol Dawson, co-owner of the 43-unit Cape Hatteras Motel. ``The
only thing we can hope for now is the weather. We're at the mercy of
the weather.''
   Outside the old U.S. Coast Guard Station at Oregon Inlet waves
battered the concrete pilings of the bridge over the inlet from
Hatteras to Bodie Island. ``It is as bad as it can be short of a
hurricane,'' said Lt. Martin L. Phillips, commander of the U.S.
Coast Guard Cape Hatteras group.
   He said erosion toppled a 125-foot U.S. Navy electronics tower on
the inlet Thursday morning.
   The storm will probably alter Oregon Inlet, a passage to the sea
for fishing boats, he said.
   ``You can't depend on the aids to navigation out there now,''
Phillips said. ``The storm is pushing a lot of sand around.''
   At Kitty Hawk, a dozen people watched Thursday while a cottage
shook against the waves until its support pilings broke, sliding the
home into the surf in one piece. As it went into the ocean, a new
water heater, kitchen appliances and new decking went with it. The
house made a quarter turn in the waves and bounced off five more
homes to its south before breaking up.
   Armand and Betty Muller, owners of the ClayDon Motor Lodge in
Kill Devil Hills, lost one unit Wednesday and watched Thursday when
another section of the motel they have managed for 23 years slipped
into the sea.
   ``It didn't go all at once. It has been coming down for three
high tides,'' Mrs. Muller said. ``But yesterday, when we saw the
floor fall out of the bottom unit and the furniture go floating
away, we knew it was over.''

<HEAD>It's NYC's Newest Who-o-o-o-o's Who: Barn Owls to Form Park Rat Patrol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL STIEG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They descend at night, death on the wing for the
skittering rats who populate city parks.
   Who?
   Barn owls, that's who _ the city's latest weapon in its endless
battle against the unwanted denizens of the parks.
   The Parks and Recreation Department said Thursday it would start
putting ``owl boxes'' in four parks to encourage more rat-devouring
birds to take up residence.
   It's called ``Operation Owl Prowl,'' and it's considered a
potential alternative to rat poison, which is becoming less toxic to
new generations of rodents and often kills animals other than their
intended targets.
   ``We're getting some recruits in the war against rats,'' said
Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, who calls the park rodents ``very
visible and increasingly bold.''
   Officials hope the plywood honeymoon cottages will encourage the
hundreds of owls that already live in the city to reproduce faster.
   An owl box ``imitates the natural habitat,'' said Marc Matsil,
director of the department's Natural Resources Group. ``They
actually prefer boxes to trees, because they're larger, more
symmetrical, better protected.''
   Similar programs have worked in Mount Rainier National Park in
Washington and Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado, Matsil said.
   Actually, barn owls don't give a hoot _ they make a loud hiss,
and sometimes a clicking sound. When frightened, the snap their
bills. They're medium-size, as owls go, with a white, heart-shaped
face ringed with tan and a tan breast.
   A barn owl can kill three rats in a night's work, Matsil said.
And not just for food _ they'll do it for fun, those feathery
fiends. If a pair of owls is raising owlets, usually four to six per
brood, they'll kill even more.
   ``The nightly labor of these owls will more than justify the
modest expense of the housing we are providing,'' Stern said.
   The program will start in the coming weeks with 25 owl boxes
scattered through four parks, including Central Park. They cost $3
to $7 apiece.
   In a couple of years, the park folks will know if it's working.
In the meantime, the city will keep using pesticides, Stern said,
while trying to keep the poison away from owl habitats.

   A drunken man wedged between a bench and
a building was saved by Gov. Edward D. DiPrite, who stopped his
police-chauffeured car and waited nearly 30 minutes while a rescue
squad freed the man.
   DiPrete was driving through a neighborhood northwest of the
Statehouse on Thursday when he noticed the man in trouble and
sprawled on the bench.
   The unidentified man's legs were atop the bench but his body was
wedged between the bench and the building. His head was touching the
ground.
   ``Are you OK?'' DiPrete asked the groggy man, but got no
intelligible response, The Providence Journal-Bulletin reported
today.
   While DiPrete's bodyguard put in a radio call for help, two women
told the governor the man had been there for an hour.
   ``It's unbelieveable, he's been here for an hour and nobody's
done anything,'' said DiPrete, who had been on his way to a
television appearance after speaking to a Providence College
journalism class.
   The man was taken to Rhode Island Hospital, where a spokesman
said he was unhurt but intoxicated and was held for observation.

<TEXT>
   The quick trip Secretary of State James A.
Baker III took to Vienna this week could mark a turning point in the
development of the Bush administration's foreign policy.
   Baker made tentative arrangements to visit Moscow in May where he
will discuss a summit meeting for President Bush with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   By the time Baker gets his first look at the Soviet Union, a
slow-moving review of U.S. arms control policy will be completed, as
well as a review of the way the United States deploys its strategic
nuclear forces.
   That would free Baker to set a date for the resumption of
negotiations with the Soviets in Geneva to sharply reduce U.S. and
Soviet long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze wanted Baker to
agree to resume in April or May. But Baker demurred. Bush and Baker
want to finish the U.S. internal reviews first.
   When the talks were suspended in December the two sides agreed to
pick up again in mid-February. But Bush ordered a delay to review
the bidding.
   The treaty the two sides were working on is not ready, of course.
Verifying compliance _ which is a diplomatic way of saying making
sure the other side can't cheat _ is unresolved. There are other
problems, as well.
   Still, the negotiators had come a long way since President Reagan
put aside his visceral distrust of Moscow and approved the search
for ways to lower tensions by destroying some of the world's most
powerful weapons.
   The review ordered by Bush implies some backtracking on the U.S.
side.
   But Baker told reporters as he flew home on Monday that the
administration's intention was not to start over, but to build on
the existing foundation.
   He wants to make sure the treaty that finally emerges in Geneva
can be ratified by the Senate. The 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty was yanked by President Carter before a ratification vote
because it faced defeat. And treaties in 1972 and 1974 to limit
underground nuclear tests were not submitted by President Ford
because he feared defeat at the hands of conservative Republicans.
   All three treaties are being observed, more or less. But Bush and
Baker want formal approval of any accord with the Soviets to reduce
long-range nuclear weapons.
   Baker seemed to get along well enough with Shevardnadze, who met
so frequently _ more than 30 times _ with Baker's predecessor,
George P. Shultz, that U.S.-Soviet relations benefited from their
ease with each other.
   At the same time, Baker did not spare the criticism he felt the
Soviets had earned by their diplomatic overture to Iran.
   He called it ``posturing,'' and suggested the Soviets were
interfering with a U.S. effort to isolate Iran over the death
threats leveled by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini against Salman
Rushdie for writing a book Khomeini considers heretical to Islam.
   The Soviets have their own interests, of course, in trying to
mend fences with a fundamentalist government that used to denounce
Moscow and Washington with equal venom as ``the great Satans.''
   One is to try to influence the Afghan rebel leaders who are in
Iran to support the establishment of a new government in Kabul that
is not hostile to Moscow.
   After all, the United States under Reagan tried its own hand at
Iranian diplomacy by surreptitiously shipping loads of missiles to
Tehran to try to secure the freedom of American hostages in Lebanon
and encourage moderation in Iran.
   The result was the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Baker also expressed displeasure over the help the Soviets have
been giving Nicaragua as the Central American country builds up its
armed forces. He complained that the arsenal is a threat to
Nicaragua's neighbors.
   Shevardnadze's response was to call for a halt in U.S. support to
Honduras, El Salvador and other friendly governments, which Baker
turned down.
   On the Middle East, the disagreement was more nuanced.
   Baker said he welcomed Soviet help in trying to resolve the
Arab-Israeli conflict. Given the fact the United States tried for
years to keep Moscow out of the picture, Baker's statement was not a
platitude.
   But he didn't bite at the continuing Soviet call for an
international peace conference. Baker wants more time before he
begins an inevitable U.S. campaign to try to push Israel to the
bargaining table under terms Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir considers
dangerous.

   Soviet inspectors Friday checked an air
base where U.S. cruise missiles were based until their elimination
under a 1987 treaty, and they also examined a missile repair
facility, the Foreign Ministry said.
   The two inspection teams will return to the Soviet Union on
Saturday, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexis Brouhns.
   The inspectors visited Florennes air base, 65 miles south of
Brussels, where 16 ground-launched cruise missiles and four spares
were kept. Inspectors also went to Gosselies, near Florennes, to
check the European repair facility, where unarmed missiles are still
repaired, Brouhns said.
   The missiles arrived in Belgium in 1985 and were removed in
December 1988, one year after former President Reagan and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty.
   It was the Soviet inspectors' second visit to Belgium. Their
first visit was in August.
   The INF treaty provides for the elimination of all Soviet and
U.S. land-based missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3,400 miles by
June 1991.

former Gestapo headquarters in Berlin, police said.
   Several windows were broken and parts of the nearby structure

   A container used to transport the flammable liquid for the attack
was found near the site, police said. A watchman doused the flames

   Police on Friday detained dozens of Moslem
fundamentalists who protested a ruling that prevents women at
universities from covering their heads in accordance with Islamic
tradition.
   About 500 protesters chanting Islamic slogans faced a police
barricade when they began marching after the Friday sermon from the
Hacibayram Mosque in the center of Ankara. A police official said 15
people were detained.
   Two female students were detained in a separate incident at the
downtown post office where a demonstration began after hundreds of
Moslem fundamentalists tried to send telegrams to the president,
premier and members of Parliament.
   At least 15 Moslem fundemantalists were detained in Istanbul at a
similar demonstration in the neighborhood of the Istanbul
University, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
   Anatolia said police detained 10 protesters in the western
province of Bursa and 20 others in the southern province of Adana in
demonstrations after the Friday sermons.
   Protesters in each incident also denounced Salman Rushdie, author
of ``The Satanic Verses.'' They chanted slogans such as ``Down with
Europe, America and Israel!'' and ``Death to Salman Rushdie!''
according to news agency reports.
   The protests grew after a constitutional court on Tuesday called
unconstitutional a parliamentary decision in December that permitted
Islamic-style head covering at the universities.
   Turbaned women say their Islamic beliefs require them to cover
their heads while in mixed company. Their defenders contend the ban
is a restriction of democratic freedoms.
   Defenders of secularism say the head-covering is an ideological
symbol of Moslem fundamentalism and thus a threat to Turkey's
modernization efforts in the past 60 years.
   Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey, reduced the role of
religion in this overwhelmingly Moslem nation. He abolished the
caliphate, adopted laws from Western Europe, replaced Arabic with
Latin script and extended full civil and political rights to women.
   Premier Turgut Ozal, a devout Moslem who has been sympathetic to
protesting students, on Thursday criticized the court's decision.
   ``We want to be a Western country,'' Ozal said. ``We want to be a
community in which freedoms are broad and people don't become angry
because of religious beliefs ... three or four girls wearing turbans
are neither going to drag Turkey backwards or help it to advance.''

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican's senior official on families
today accused Planned Parenthood of ``encouraging promiscuity'' and
criticized feminism in a speech to the U.S. Roman Catholic hierarchy.
   Cardinal Edouard Gagnon, president of the Pontifical Council for
the Family, applauded Catholics who fight against the Roe vs. Wade
decision of the U.S. Supreme Court allowing abortion.
   But he charged that in the United States some forms of ministry
to divorced Catholics had ``degenerated into dating services.'' He
urged caution in granting annulments, saying that in allowing women
to help decide such cases ``we have to be careful that their tender
hearts do not play tricks on them.''
   In Chicago, the acting president of the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, David J. Andrews, said Gagnon ``is absolutely
right'' in suggesting that the group opposes the church's position
on birth control.
   Andrews said Gagnon's speech reflects ``the desperation of a
church trying to come to grips with the issue of sexuality and with
the fact that people the world over rely on effective methods of
birth control and want to keep abortion services safe and legal.''
   Gagnon spoke on the third day of an extraordinary four-day
meeting on the 52 million-member Catholic Church in the United
States. Pope John Paul II summoned 35 American prelates to the
Vatican to discuss how bishops should defend Catholic teaching in
the face of dissent and secularism.
   While Gagnon's speech repeated well-known Vatican positions on
sexual issues, it was strongly worded and unusually specific,
reflecting the church's concern about the high number of American
Catholics going their own way on matters like birth control and
divorce.
   Gagnon told the prelates that Planned Parenthood was challenging
the Vatican's ban on artificial contraception by trying to set up
school-based birth control clinics.
   ``Planned Parenthood programs of sex education in no way resolve
the problem of teen-age pregnancies but rather increase it by
encouraging promiscuity,'' he said, according to a text of his
speech that was released by the Vatican.
   The Canadian cardinal also accused Planned Parenthood of trying
to undermine the only form of birth control the Catholic Church
allows, which is known as natural family planning. It involves
having a couple abstain from sex during the wife's fertile period.
   An estimated 70 percent of American Catholics use artificial
birth control, and U.S. Catholic bishops suggested in a draft
pastoral letter in April that the church should be more responsive
toward them. However, Pope John Paul II has declared there are no
exceptions to church teaching on the issue.
   In his speech, Gagnon called on bishops to do something about
``subtle pornography, that is the degrading of moral values vehicled
by cinema and TV shows which pretend to depict normal American
life.''
   He said Americans had to realize how much influence their
television programs have worldwide. Mentioning the TV series
``Dallas,'' known for its potrayal of sexual affairs and an affluent
society, Gagnon said bishops in other countries ``would like us to
reflect on what we export can do to the conscience of their people.''
   The cardinal said that the church should work for the promotion
of women but that ``ideological feminism has a deterious influence
on the family.'' He did not elaborate.
   In the other major speech given at the session, Archbishop John
Quinn of San Francisco said the American church had successfully
promoted family life but that poverty, drug use and mobility
presented major challenges.
   In an apparent response to Vatican criticism of the high number
of marriage annulments granted, Quinn said diocesan tribunals take
great care in reaching decisions.
   In discussion at today's session, a Vatican cardinal expressed
concern at the large number of annulments granted in the United
States. Achille Silvestrini supplied figures showing that of 46,632
annulments granted in the world in 1985, 36,180 of them were in the
United States.

   The Pacayo Volcano spewed lava, ash and
sand on Friday, destroying coffee plantations in the path of the
molten rock, seismologists said.
   The lava was moving at about 4 yards per hour over its south
slopes, said Eddy Sanchez, assistant director of the Seismological
Institute.
   No injuries have been reported and there was no estimate of
damage.
   ``It's a spectacular but not dangerous eruption,'' Estuardo
Velasquez, the institute's director said.
   The display from two new craters that opened on the 8,420-high
mountain was visible from the capital city 15 miles away on Thursday
night. Hundreds of people drove to the area to get a better look.
   About 255 people were evacuated from the villages of El Caracol
and El Patrocinio after the volcano became active Tuesday. They were
being cared for by the National Emergency Committee in a town on the
slopes of Pacayo, 15 miles from the capital.
   Other villages in the area were watching it closely and feared
the flow could turn to the north, where communities were affected in
June 1987 eruption.

<TEXT>
   The good news from the Milan winter runway,
which kicks off a new fashion decade, is that women can wear what
they like and still be in style.
   No single trend or style emerged in this week's showings of the
Italian ready-to-wear collections for the fall-winter 1989-90.
Rather, it was a mixed fashion bag full of good-looking clothes,
which don't require a perfect body.
   Hemlines range from the thigh to the floor, skirts come in tight
and loose versions, jackets tend to be short but can also be
three-quarter, there are trousers for every taste and configuration,
solid colors abound but so do plaid, floral and paisley prints.
   In general the designers stay away from the sexy aggressiveness
epitomized by the miniskirt _ the Italian rage several seasons ago _
to present a quieter, more casual style: dropped shoulders, long
languid lines and completely flat footwear.
   The color scheme draws inspiration from the shades of an autumn
forest: brown, moss green, burnt yellow and berry blues and reds.
Orange and fuchsia are the favorite shocking shades. Gray and black
show up in every collection.
   As always with Italian ready-to-wear these outfits are based on
the good tailoring and beautiful fabrics which have become the
trademark of the ``moda Milanese'' (Milan fashion).
   Some say the designers put their pocket books before their
creative talents in this latest round of collections.
   But, according to Marjorie Deane, a U.S. consultant who puts out
her own fashion report, this is not necessarily a sin.
   ``Luxury Italian ready-to-wear is our best-seller,'' she said.
``There might not be big news here, but it will be a very popular
season. Women will feel good in these clothes, and why shouldn't
they?''
   The hottest item on the Milan winter runway is the coat, as big
and cozy as possible with broad shawl collar and ample dropped
sleeve, and a hemline which often grazes the floor. Some coats have
hoods; others are worn with long wool or fur scarves.
   Capes and three-quarter jackets also play heavily in the
collections.
   For the animal-lover, the designers offer fake furs made out of
wooly synthetic fabrics to look like everything from sable to
leopard. Fabric printed with animal spots and stripes is another
ecologically minded option.
   Some of the winter offerings of Italy's top ready-to-wear
designers:
   Armani _ The curved hem, tulip-shaped skirt, floral printed silk
quilted jackets, and a whole zoo of fun fake furs.
   Basile _ Chic tweedy daytime suits and beautiful white silk
evening blouses.
   Biagiotti _ Dresses in luxurious bunched and ruffled cashmere.
   Fendi _ Reversible furs where the leather side of the pelt,
treated to look like polished cotton, becomes the outside of a sable
coat as well as its lining.
   Ferre _ Huge wrap-around-the-neck scarves in fox fur printed to
look like leopard and zebra, and the most chic pants on the runway
in simple gray flannel.
   Krizia _ Languid cashmere tunic dresses and hip-length sweaters
featuring prints of her animal of the year: the tiger.
   Missoni _ Beautiful floral printed jackets worthy of the best
years of the famous knitting family.
   Mario Valentino _ Leather at its best in coats and jackets, some
with punched-out suede collars to look like lace.
   Versace _ The shortest skirt in Milan and perhaps the world _
less than a foot of fabric between the waist and the hemline.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. research plane left a Norwegian air
base Friday to test the air over the vast whiteness of the North
Pole, where scientists say pollution rivals that of smog-ridden
American cities.
   The modified P3 Orion surveillance aircraft will make 10
high-altitude flights from Bodoe air force base to trace the sources
and types of pollutants blamed for the ``Greenhouse Effect'' _ the
gradual warming of the atmosphere.
   From the ground, the Arctic may seem pristine in its frozen
isolation, but from high altitudes it is not.
   ``Sometimes visibility is reduced to a couple of kilometers,''
said Russell Schnell, a University of Colorado atmospheric scientist.
   ``Arctic air pollution is as bad as you'd find in any American
city. It's as bad as the Denver brown cloud or the smog of L.A.''
   He is one of 40 American scientists stationed at Bodoe, 540 miles
north of Oslo, until April 20 to chart gases, chemicals, visibility
and temperatures for the Coordinated Eastern Arctic Experiment, a $2
million study of polar pollution sponsored by the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Survey.
   Schnell said his team also flew the Orion, a hurricane stalker in
summer, from Canada and Greenland but ``came to Norway to get as
close as possible to the source of pollution'' for the project's
most comprehensive phase.
   He said more pollution drifts over the pole from Norway than from
the Arctic regions of North America because more people live in the
far north of Europe, where ground temperatures are moderated by the
warmth of the Gulf Stream.
   In a telephone interview from the air base, Schnell said: ``Look
at Bodoe. It's at about the same latitude as Barrow, Alaska. Here
they grow potatoes. In Barrow it's too cold to grow anything. The
Arctic is 1,000 times more polluted than the Antarctic because
people live in it.''
   Twenty scientists and crew were aboard the Orion when it left
Friday for its mission over the pole and Svalbard, an Arctic island
off the northwestern Norway.
   Norwegian and Canadian scientists are assisting the U.S. study
with ground measurements to compare with figures recorded by the
Orion's instruments as the plane passes six miles above the ice
pack, Schnell said.
   This is the winter's second American-financed study of polar
conditions form Norway. In a project sponsored by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, a modifed U-2 spy plane flew
Arctic missions to measure the ozone layer, which shields the earth
from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.
   Schnell said the Orion would measure such ozone-depleting gases
as halon and chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs. He added that ``we
also want data on carbon dioxide levels produced by burning fossil
fuels and on partical pollution, such as dust and soot.''
   Increasing scientific evidence shows that CFCs are destroying the
ozone shield. When CFCs reach the stratosphere 15-25 miles up, as
much as 100 years after emission, they break apart and their
chlorine atoms deplete the fragile ozone layer. CFCs also trap heat,
increasing Earth's temperature.
   Scientists have said the phenomenon could cause dramatic climate
changes within decades that would increase the fury of tropical
storms and raise the level of the seas, threatening coastal floods.
   Rough estimates of the Arctic's condition probably will be
released next month, Schnell said, with more precise figures to
follow in a year.
   A seven-foot section of the Orion's wingtip was removed to house
a radiometer for measuring the sun's rays, he said, and highly
sensitive radar will gauge cloud and particle density.
   ``We also will look for polar lows, small but fierce storms
similar to hurricanes,'' the scientist said.
   ``Long ago, whole Arctic island villages would sometimes
disappear and no one knew why. Polar lows probably swept them
clean.''

   Former national security adviser Robert
McFarlane told a jury today that top Reagan administration officials
discussed whether arranging third-country aid to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels was an illegal act for which the president could be
impeached.
   Testifying at Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial, McFarlane said
then-White House chief of staff James A. Baker III took the position
at the June 25, 1984 meeting of the National Security Planning Group
that it was illegal to solicit third-country aid.
   ``I took it to mean ... that if the president were to authorize
... money from third countries that would be a violation of law and
he could therefore be so charged and impeached ... removed from
office,'' said McFarlane. Members of the planning group included the
president, vice president and secretaries of state and defense.
   McFarlane recalled that Baker's view was ``strongly countered''
and that the consensus from the meeting was that Baker's opinion was
``not true.''
   Saudi Arabia that year began giving the Contras $1 million a
month.
   Prosecutor John Keker asked McFarlane whether top administration
officials were being asked to lie to Congress about the secret
third-country aid. McFarlane said the intent was ``just not to
have'' the matter ``become public.''
   McFarlane said the Reagan administration decided to seek help for
the rebrels from other countries because it did not wish to become
involved in a messy political fight with Congress by seeking
additional Contra aid in an election year.
   ``The American people don't like violence,'' McFarlane said in
regard to the war the Contras were waging against the leftist
Nicaraguan government.
   Earlier today, a public relations consultant who moved money to
the Contras testified at the U.S. District Court trial that North
approved taking a 10 percent cut from private donations to the rebel
cause.
   Richard Miller said North told him at the end of 1985 that ``most
of the people involved'' in the fund-raising network were ``getting
20 to 30 percent.''
   Miller also told how he asked the former White House aide for
lists of ``big-ticket items'' the Contras needed that would be
``comprehensible'' to potential contributors.
   Miller said that in July 1985, North suggested C-4 plastic
explosives and M-79 grenades. But he said the two men agreed that
``it was just not appropriate ... to be raising money for weapons''
through a tax-exempt organization headed by Carl ``Spitz'' Channell,
a conservative fund-raiser with whom Miller was working to support
the Contras.
   However, Miller said, North in October 1985 suggested a list of
items that included 50 shoulder-held anti-aircraft missiles at a
cost of $20,000 to shoot down Soviet HIND helicopters in Nicaragua.
   Miller recalled that North raised the cost to $22,100 when Miller
asked about shipping charges. The list was used to solicit a
contribution from wealthy Connecticut widow Barbara Newington, who
asked North whether he knew where to get the missiles.
   ``He said, `Yes, we know where to get them,''' Miller recalled.
Mrs. Newington ended up giving $1.2 million in stock.
   In the spring of 1986, Miller said, he asked North about the
missiles because Soviet helicopters were still plaguing the Contras.
North responded that ``they really didn't need'' the missiles and
what they needed instead were secure communication devices, the
witness said.
   During a meeting at the end of 1985 in North's office, ``I asked
to take 10 percent out of the stream of money,'' Miller recalled,
and North responded that that seemed ``reasonable.''
   Miller used a Cayman Islands corporation, I.C. Inc., to move
tax-exempt contributions raised by Channell's organization.
   He said ``I would notify Colonel North that I had'' the money
``and would await instruction from Colonel North on where to send
it.''
   Frequently, he said, North told him to move funds to a Swiss bank
account controlled by arms dealers Richard Secord and Albert Hakim,
North's co-defendants in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Miller said his 10 percent cut would be ``automatically
deducted'' from the funds.
   Miller agreed with prosecutor David Zornow that despite North's
refusal to be in the room when money was being solicited by Channell
and others, North in one instance had contacted Miller requesting
$30,000 on short notice, which Miller helped to get. He also agreed
that North was told how much money was going to be solicited from
donors and how much had been obtained.
   Another figure involved in the private Contra fund-raising
network, Daniel L. Conrad, said Thursday that North angrily
complained about having to answer ``asinine'' congressional
questions.
   Conrad, the liaison between North and Channell, said North made
the comment in the fall of 1985 and then told Conrad the two had to
stop meeting at North's office.

   The Vatican on Friday made a major
reorganization of the church in Lithuania and hailed it as a
breakthrough for Roman Catholics in the Soviet republic.
   The steps included the naming of three heads of dioceses by Pope
John Paul II, the first residential bishops appointed in Lithuania
since the end of World War II.
   The changes are believed to have needed at least the tacit
approval of the Soviet government.
   Lithuania, an independent country before the war, was occupied by
the Soviet Union in 1940. About 80 percent of its 3.5 million people
are said to be Roman Catholics.
   ``The Holy See is pleased that we could arrive at a
reorganization that was desired by Catholics in Lithuania,'' said
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   Under the reorganization, Cardinal Vincentas Sladkevicius was
named archbishop of Kaunas and Monsignor Julijonas Steponavicius was
appointed archbishop of Vilnius.
   Sladkevicius had been serving in Kaisiadorys and Steponavicius in
Vilnius but each with the title apostolic administrator. This meant
they were not fully empowered as residential bishops.
   While in practice the functions are similar, the naming of a full
residential bishop has considerable importance for the church as a
sign of a more normal climate.
   Oly in December the Soviet government allowed Steponavicius to
resume his official duties after 28 years in internal exile. He was
exiled to northern Lithuania in 1961 for refusing to collaborate
with Soviet authorities.
   In a third appointment Friday, the pope named Monsignor Antanas
Vaicius bishop of Telsiai, where he had been serving as apostolic
administrator.
   John Paul also named apostolic administrators for Kaisiadorys and
Vilkaviskis.
   In response to a question, Navarro said he didn't believe the
steps meant the way was open for a possible papal visit to
Lithuania. John Paul has said that he has been refused permission to
visit Lithuania on at least two occasions.
   ``I wouldn't make any connection'' to such a visit, Navarro said.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is scheduled to visit Italy
in November and was recently reported to have expressed interest in
meeting with the pope. The Vatican says John Paul would welcome such
a meeting, which would be the first between a Roman Catholic pontiff
and a Soviet leader.

   A severe sandstorm struck the northern and
central Persian Gulf on Friday, reducing visibility to a few hundred
yards and disrupting airline flights in Kuwait and Bahrain.
   Civil Aviation officials said two flights from Sri Lanka and
Bangladsh, bound for Kuwait, were diverted to Manama because of the
storm. When the storm hit Bahrain, at least two departing flights
were delayed for an hour or more.
   Visibility on Bahrain's coastal highway was reduced to less than
600 yards as the huge cloud of yellow dust darkened skies and
covered everything with a coat of silt.
   Temperatures fell to about 46 degrees. Seas were running 3 to 7
feet in deeper waters.
   ``Thick dust was generated by strong winds flowing around a low
pressure system which moved eastward across the region in the
northern gulf,'' said an official from the Bahrain Meteorological
Section.
   Sandstorms are common in the gulf but residents said Friday's was
the most severe in years.
   Small amounts of rain are normal in the arid region this time of
year, but this season has been unusually dry.

   President Bush cast a wide net today for a
replacement for rejected nominee John Tower as defense secretary and
was expected to move swiftly on his choice, his spokesman said today.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was
considering multiple candidates for the post and that ``phone calls
are being made.''
   Fitzwater would not characterize the list and said that while the
president had ``no timetable'' on his announcement, one was expected
relatively soon. He even held out the possibility that a decision
could come later today.
   Bush ``is being encouraged by everyone to do it in spokesman said.
   Presidential aides began looking at various candidates
immediately after ta hurry,'' the
he Senate voted 53-47 Thursday to reject Tower,
Bush's first choice, for the post.
   The president was meeting with advisers on the issue throughout
the day, and both he and top aides were making phone calls to
prospective candidates, Fitzwater said.
   ``A lot of names have been suggested,'' he said, adding that some
of them were among those passed over the first time around when
Tower was selected.
   ``It's not starting from scratch. Basically, there's a large
r Tower and suggested that
some senators made up their minds ``based on groundless rumor.''
   ``Now, however, we owe it to the American people to come together
and move forward,'' he said.
   A new nomination may could come before week's end, a senior
administration official said Thursday. The official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said a long informal list of candidates had
been compiled even before the Tower vote.
   The official noted that some of the names had been compiled late
last year, before Tower was finally selected in December. ``We're
not starting from scratch,'' the official said.
   Fitzwater, however, insisted that Bush himself had not given
serious thought to a replacement as long as Tower's nomination was
before the Senate.
   ``He's had discussions with the chief of staff (John Sununu) and
Brent Scowcroft in terms of what kind of candidates he's interested
in. ... But I would hasten to point out there's some difference
between that and actually having a list of candidates,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Scowcroft himself has been the subject of much speculation for
the defense post. Some members of Congress have even suggested a job
switch with Tower _ since the national security adviser's post does
not require Senate confirmation.
   Scowcroft said Thursday he was not in line for the job, but that
hasn't stopped the talk.
   Among the other contenders, Edwards is popular among lawmakers of
both parties. He is former senior Republican on the House defense
appropriations subcommittee and his expertise on military matters is
widely respected.
   Lewis, chairman of Union Pacific Corp., was transportation
secretary under former President Ford and co-chairman of the
recently disbanded National Economic Commission. He would bring to
the job considerable management experience.
   Rumsfeld served as defense secretary under Ford.
   Of the three senators being mentioned, Warner, a former Navy
secretary, might be the most easily confirmed _ but his nomination
would rob Republicans of one Senate seat, since governors fill
Senate vacancies and Virginia's governor is a Democrat.
   That would not be a problem for Rudman from New Hampshire or
Cohen from Maine, since both states have GOP governors.
   Administration sources have said that Bush, not wanting to
subject another candidate to the grueling experience Tower went
through, seemed likely to pick someone either currently or recently
in government who had been through the confirmation process, or a
member of Congress.
   However, the names of some business executives have also cropped
up _ including Donald Rice of the Rand Corp. and Frank Borman,
former astronaut-turned-executive.
   And, two who served in the administration of former President
Jimmy Carter are also being mentioned as dark-horse possibilities:
Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was Carter's national security adviser; and
James Schlesinger, who was his energy secretary _ after serving as
Ford's first defense secretary.
   Bush planned to spend the weekend in Camp David and invited
members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and their wives. But Fitzwater
said the get-together was mainly social and had nothing to do with
finding a replacement for Tower.

   A human rights activist said a court in the Ukraine
on Friday found a religious activist guilty of organizing an
unauthorized meeting, and that people who surrounded the court were
attacked by police.
   Anatoly Dotsenko, a spokesman for the recently formed Ukrainian
Helsinki Society, said Irina Kalenets was found guilty of helping
organize a gathering of thousands of people Feb. 26 dedicated to
Ukrainian national poet Taras Shevchenko.
   He said the court in the city of Lvov found that the gathering
was not a religious service but an unauthorized public gathering.
Ms. Kalenets is a leader of a women's religious group and a human
rights activist, he said.
   Dotsenko said he received his information by telephone from one
of the society's founders, Vyacheslav Chernovil in Lvov.
   A second person, Mikhailo Gorin, also was taken to court on
similar charges but the results of that case were not known,
Dotsenko said.
   He said police surrounded the court during Gorin's trial and
began to beat and arrest people who gathered outside the police
barricade.
   There was no independent confirmation of his report.
   Lvov, a center of Ukrainian nationalism, is located in the far
western part of the republic. The western part of the Ukraine only
became part of the Soviet Union after World War II, and pockets of
resistance to Soviet rule remained until the early 1950s.

   A Hong Kong official said Friday he expected a
second batch of Vietnamese boat people to return to their communist
homeland next month.
   Secretary of Security Geoffrey Barnes, speaking upon his return
from an international meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on the
region's flood of asylum-seekers, said Vietnam has agreed to accept
another 150 Vietnamese who have volunteered to go home after fleeing
to Hong Kong by boat.
   Hong Kong adopted a tough policy to treat all Vietnamese boat
people arriving after June 15 as illegal immigrants subject to
repatriation unless they can prove they fled persecution.
   About 11,000 Vietnamese have sailed into this British colony
since then, and some have decided they would prefer to return to
Vietnam than face an uncertain future in crowded Hong Kong camps.
   A group of 75 Vietnamese flew to Hanoi on March 2 in the first
large-scale repatriation of boat people.
   Barnes quoted Vu Khoan, the leader of the Vietnamese delegation
at the Malaysian conference, as saying he hoped to see another group
of Vietnamese return home soon.
   ``He (Vu) also said he would like to see a larger group going
back than last time,'' Barnes said.
   Barnes said he expected the next repatriation would take place in
April. ``In the meantime of course we'll try to encourage more to go
back voluntarily,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A multimillion-dollar
international cleanup effort is concluding at the site of a wrecked
Argentine supply ship that still holds about 63,000 gallons of
diesel fuel, U.S. and Argentine officials said.
   The authorities interviewed this week said little more could be
done with the half-sunken ship, the Bahia Paraiso, before the
Antarctic winter sets in.
   ``The mission is practically completed,'' said Capt. Heberto
Rubatino, head of the Argentine navy's anti-pollution office. ``We
are sure we have checked out, cleaned up and controlled all of the
Bahia Paraiso's tanks.''
   Rubatino, in a meeting with U.S. authorities aboard an Argentine
navy cargo ship anchored near the site, said some of the Bahia
Paraiso's fuel storage tanks could not be reached safely by divers
to pump them out. He said they had been sealed.
   A U.S. navy salvage expert, William Walker, said the ship still
held about 63,000 gallons of diesel fuel. He agreed the fuel was
unreachable.
   He said the vessel had been carrying about 265,000 gallons of
diesel fuel when it ran aground Jan. 28 on shoals about two miles
from Palmer Station, a U.S. research base on the Antarctic Peninsula
about 600 miles from the tip of South America.
   The Bahia Paraiso rolled over and partially sank three days after
it ran aground. It is on its side, and part of its gashed orange
hull and its deck remain above the water line. The waters
immediately around the wreck are discolored and smell of fuel.
   The United States, Chile and Argentina sent teams and equipment
to the site. Walker said about 16,400 gallons of fuel was pumped out
of the wreck, after hundreds of thousands of gallons leaked out.
   Walker also said any effort to salvage the vessel, or to cut it
up and remove it from the site, would take three years and cost as
much as $60 million _ far more than the ship's value. Any decision
on whether to salvage the vessel would have to be made by Argentine
authorities, he said.
   Peter Wilkniss, polar programs director for the National Science
Foundation, said clean-up efforts by Argentine and U.S. experts
would conclude about March 15. He said scientists from the United
States, Argentina and Chile was being sent to Palmer Station to
study the spill's effects on the area's wildlife. The foundation
supervises all U.S. activities in Antarctica.
   He said the diesel still in the ship's tanks was expected to
continue to leak, ``maybe for as long as a year.'' Some floating
containment booms would be placed to try to control the leakage.
   ``There's little more we can do before winter sets in,'' he said.
   ``The best thing that could happen, as cruel as it sounds, is for
it (the ship) to break up and spill its guts all at once,'' he said.
This would bring contamination to a quicker end and allow the
wildlife to recuperate, he said.
   Wilkniss said, however, that experts were unable to predict
whether the ship would break up in a big storm or slowly rust
through.
   The Palmer Station area abounds with wildlife, including penguins
and seals. Scientists say they have found many dead seabirds,
including skuas and cormorants, and a few dead penguins, but are
unable to say for certain if pollution was to blame.
   Pollution experts say diesel fuel, because of its high
volatility, evaporates quickly and is less damaging to wildlife than
thicker petroleum products.
   On Feb. 26, a Peruvian research ship, the Humboldt, ran aground
in Antarctica near King George Island, 300 miles from Palmer
Station. Authorities said the Humboldt spilled a small amount of
fuel that was treated by the Chilean navy with chemical dispersants.
The ship was refloated March 6.

<HEAD>Campaign Winds Down Before Sunday's Municipal Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Candidates on Friday ended campaigning for municipal
elections that are largely dominated by local issues but could test
the health of France's Socialist government.
   Political observers gave the Socialists the edge in the voting in
the more than 36,500 communities choosing mayors and city council
members in Sunday's first round of voting. The second round takes
place March 19 in towns where no party wins an absolute majority.
   Television and radio coverage of the campaigns was forbidden as
of midnight Friday. All polls were banned at the start of the week
in keeping with French electoral rules.
   The extreme right National Front made last-minute calls to the
conservative right to join in second-round alliances.
   ``If there can be no such accord, too bad for them,'' National
Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said Thursday night.
   Le Pen is running in Paris' 20th district, a working-class
quarter dominated by Asian and North African immigrants.
   It remained unclear to what extent conservatives would need the
National Front, which stunned the nation when Le Pen gained a
crucial 14 percent of the vote in the first round of May
presidential elections.
   Any sizable Socialist loss would be seen as a judgment on the
government of Socialist Premier Michel Rocard. But that seemed
unlikely to happen because recent popularity polls give high ratings
to Rocard and President Francois Mitterrand.
   The Socialists expect to gain control of as many as 20 additional
cities with more than 30,000 people.
   However, Jean-Marie Le Guen, first secretary of the Socialist
Federation of Paris, conceded Friday he was worried voters might not
go to the polls. He accused conservative Mayor Jacques Chirac of
``refusing to call Parisians to their civic duties.''
   Chirac, who has campaigned on issues such as traffic, environment
and housing, was in no danger of losing his job in the city he has
held since 1977. His Socialist opponent, Interior Minister Pierre
Joxe, has all but conceded defeat.
   Joxe has indicated he would be satisfied if the conservatives
lost several of Paris' 20 districts, where they now have a total
monopoly.
   A loss of even one Paris district would be a setback for Chirac,
the head of the Rally for the Republic. Chirac has been trying to
rebuild his power base, which eroded after his defeat in the May
presidential election to Mitterrand.
   In Lyon, the age factor has become an issue with 78-year-old
incumbant Mayor Francisque Collomb, a centrist, facing Michel Noir
of Chirac's RPR, who at 45 is considered the favorite.
   In the Socialist bastion of Marseille, Mayor Robert Vigouroux,
favored to win re-election, was ousted from the Socialist Party when
he refused to step aside in favor of the official Socialist
candidate, Michel Pezet.
   Center-right candidate Jean-Claude Gaudin also is a candidate.

   The Soviet Union lodged a ``resolute protest''
over the expulsion of a military attache allegedly involved in a spy
operation aimed at learning how the U.S. government protects
computer secrets.
   Lt. Col. Yuriy Nikolayevich Pakhtusov, 35, was told to leave
Thursday. An FBI investigation had led to his arrest Wednesday
night, just a day after the Bush administration opened a high-level
dialogue with the Soviet Union.
   Pakhtusov was described by a U.S. source as a significant catch
because he is a member of the Red Army's GRU intelligence arm. One
official said Pakhtusov was caught ``red-handed.''
   But the Soviet Embassy issued a statement saying the expulsion
order ``could be only qualified as a deliberate provocation against
a Soviet diplomatic official.''
   It denied that Pakhtusov engaged in any wrongdoing and said the
embassy has lodged a ``resolute protest'' with the State Department.
   Asked about the Soviet allegations today, department spokesman
Charles Redman said, ``The reason for our actions is very simple. He
was caught red-handed with the goods and no amount of verbiage can
change that.''
   Redman added that the Soviets have informed the United States
that Pakhtusov will be leaving as requested.
   He said there is no reaosn to believe the incident will affect
U.S.-Soviet relations. The Soviets are aware that the United States
will protect its national security interests whenever it's
threatened, he said.
   State Department press officer Dennis Harter said the Soviet
Embassy was informed that Pakhtusov was being expelled for
``activities incompatible with his diplomatic status.''
   According to one government source, Pakhtusov was asked to leave
by Saturday.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov called the
expulsion a ``gross provocation'' at a regularly scheduled news
briefing today in Moscow, but he did not announce any retaliatory
Soviet action.
   He said ``the U.S. side is assuming all the responsibilities'' of
the decision to expel Pakhtusov.
   Repeatedly asked by reporters whether Pakhtusov was engaged in
spying, Gerasimov responded: ``He did not violate diplomatic status
with whatever he did.''
   Violating diplomatic status is an oft-used diplomatic euphemism
for spying.
   In Vienna on Tuesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III met
for the first time with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and announced plans for a visit to Moscow in May.
   The FBI probe was set in motion in August, two months after
Pakhtusov's arrival, when he approached an American employee of a
company that deals in classified information.
   The American, who was not identified, reported the contact to the
FBI, which began monitoring contacts between the two.
   There is growing evidence that the Soviets are placing high
priority on gaining access to Western computers with sensitive
military, nuclear and space research information stored inside them.
   A week ago, West German authorities charged a computer hacker
with espionage and said a total of eight people were suspected of
selling sensitive computer data from the United States and allied
countries to the Soviets from 1986 through last year.
   The German action was described by officials as the first
confirmed case of Soviet computer espionage. A State Department
official, who asked not to be identified, said there was no
connection between the German and Pakhtusov cases.
   From Moscow the official Soviet news agency Tass today expressed
outrage at the expulsion and reported that Pakhtusov was arrested
while taking out the garbage at his home in Virginia.
   Neither Tass nor other Soviet media said whether there would be
any retaliatory action taken against Americans in the Soviet Union.
   Soviet interest in penetrating Western computer banks has added a
new dimension to the ongoing effort to make stored data secure
without making it inaccessible to those with a legitimate need for
it.
   Previously, the problem had been limited to hackers who try to
penetrate computers as a hobby.
   Pakhtusov is the first publicly acknowledged case of a Soviet
envoy being expelled by the United States since December 1987, when
Mikhail Kathov, second secretary at the Soviet mission to the United
Nations, was ordered home for trying to obtain information on
military technology.
   In September 1986, the Reagan administration, alleging widespread
spying activities, ordered the expulsion in stages of 105 Soviets
from Moscow's U.N. mission. The Soviets retaliated by expelling a
number of American diplomats from Moscow.

   The United States will be responsible for any
consequences arising from the expulsion of a Washington-based Soviet
diplomat accused of spying on U.S. computer operations, Soviet
officials said Friday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov called the
expulsion of Lt. Col. Yuri N. Pakhtusov a ``gross provocation.''
   In Washington, the Soviet Embassy lodged a ``resolute protest''
with the State Department.
   The Soviets did not announce any retaliatory action, but
Gerasimov said: ``In taking the decision to expel Pakhtusov ... the
U.S. is assuming all responsibilities.''
   ``What we have here is an intentional, preplanned action against
a Soviet diplomatic employee who did not carry out any actions
incompatible with his diplomatic status,'' he said at a news
briefing.
   Pakhtusov, a military attache at the Soviet Embassy in
Washington, was ordered home Thursday after the FBI said it caught
him receiving sensitive information Wednesday night on how the U.S.
government protects computer secrets.
   A U.S. source identified the 35-year-old Soviet as a member of
GRU, the Soviet military's intelligence arm.
   Repeatedly asked by reporters whether Pakhtusov was a spy,
Gerasimov said: ``He did not violate diplomatic status with whatever
he did.''
   ``Violating diplomatic status'' is a euphemism for spying.
   U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock called Gerasimov's remarks
``nonsense.''
   Matlock later met with the Soviet deputy foreign ministry,
Vladimir F. Petrovsky. A senior U.S. official, who spoke on
condition he not be identified further, said the meeting was
arranged before the expulsion.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the men discussed ``questions on
global problems and on the activity of international organizations.''
   Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert said the U.S. mission in Moscow
had received no notice of any Soviet retaliation for the expulsion,
``nor do we expect any.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said:
``The reason for our actions is very simple. He was caught
red-handed with the goods and no amount of verbiage can change
that.''
   Redman added the Soviets have informed the United States that
Pakhtusov will be leaving as requested. A diplomatic source in
Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity said Pakhtusov had
been told to leave by Saturday.
   He said there is no reason to believe the incident will affect
U.S.-Soviet relations. The Soviets are aware that the United States
will protect its national security interests whenever it's
threatened, he said.
   Tass and Gerasimov gave different versions of Pakhtusov's arrest.
   Tass said he was taking out the garbage at his Virginia home and
was in slippers at the time.
   Gerasimov said he was arrested while visiting a neighbor in an
upstairs apartment, and indicated he was the victim of entrapment.
   ``He went to visit one of (his) neighbors, and, as is being
asserted, he was offered some financial aid,'' Gerasimov said.
``Perhaps they wanted to hand him some sum of money. What I can see
in this is an habitual FBI tactic.''
   Gerasimov and Tass blamed the expulsion on U.S. opponents of
better superpower relations.
   Over the years, when one superpower expelled a diplomat on spying
charges, the other nation has responded in kind.
   In October 1986, after 25 Soviet diplomats were ordered out of
the Soviet U.N. Mission in New York, the Kremlin expelled five
American diplomats.

<HEAD>IRS Helpers Giving More Wrong Answers to Taxpayer Questions This
Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service said Friday that
its telephone ``assistors'' are giving even more wrong answers than
last year, and the agency promised to waive penalties for taxpayers
who can document the erroneous information.
   So far this year, calls to the IRS toll-free numbers are
producing answers that would lead to errors on taxpayer returns 30.8
percent of the time, the agency said. At this time last year, the
error rate was about 28 percent.
   ``We are not pleased ... with our performance with respect to
accuracy,'' Robert LeBaube, IRS director of taxpayer services, told
reporters. ``It is our every intention to see this error rate go
down as quickly as possible.''
   LeBaube said the agency will not penalize a taxpayer for an error
caused by faulty advice from an IRS employee if the taxpayer can
provide the name of the employee, the question asked and the date of
the wrong answer. The IRS took a similar stance last year.
   ``We are not out to cause pain and suffering of people in any
way,'' LeBaube said.
   He said the massive changes included in the 1986 tax overhaul _
which was hailed by congressional backers and then-President Reagan
as simplification _ and the sheer number of tax bills enacted must
carry a lot of the blame for the confusion among IRS employees.
   ``Since 1976 there have been 138 public laws modifying the
Internal Revenue Code,'' LeBaube said. ``Since the Tax Reform Act of
1986 there have been 13 public laws changing the code, and in 1988
alone there were seven public laws affecting the code.''
   As an example, LeBaube explained, there was a time when it was
simple to answer a taxpayer's question about his or her personal
exemption. Under the new law, he said, ``a `simple' question on the
dependency exemption can require as many as 42 probing follow-up
questions to get the correct answer for a particular taxpayer in a
particular set of circumstances.''
   The General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, did its own
testing of IRS employees during the 1988 return-filing season and
found the agency provided wrong answers to 36 percent of test
questions. One of the main problems, GAO found, was the failure of
IRS employees known as ``assistors'' to probe callers for additional
information.
   The IRS has 5,000 assistors, many of them part-time employees,
answering taxpayers' toll-free telephone calls this filing season.
About 1,500 of that number are new to the job. These workers, who
earn from $6.50 to $11.70 an hour, must have at least a high school
education and undergo a minimum of five weeks' training.
   ``They are not accountants or tax lawyers,'' LeBaube noted. ``I
don't think the economy could support giving us 5,000 tax
accountants'' to answer calls.
   Through last weekend, the telephone system had received 15.5
million calls since Jan. 1, compared with 16.9 million for the same
period a year ago. About 45 percent of the calls are seeking answers
to specific questions about filling out a return. About 84 percent
of callers get through to the IRS on the first or second try,
LeBaube said.
   Although fewer people are calling with questions this year, the
IRS Tele-Tax system, which provides taped answers on more than 150
specific tax subjects, has received 7.8 million calls _ more than
triple the figure at this time last year.
   In an effort to improve the toll-free system, an IRS team is
making about 20,000 calls with test questions this filing season.
The 62 questions used are tailored to approximate those that typical
taxpayers would pose.
   The test system has been enhanced this year to seek out and
correct areas of tax law that are producing the most errors by
assistors. The biggest problems this year are questions dealing with
capital gains and losses and with pensions, LeBaube said.

   Millions of Britons left their inhibitions at home
Friday and clowned around for charity, sporting red plastic noses
while performing crazy antics like kissing policemen or dining on a
dung heap.
   They happily bathed in baked beans or porridge, threw custard at
their bosses and put tax collectors in the stocks as part of the
country's second madcap fund-raising ``Red Nose Day.''
   Six million shiny red noses were sold at pubs, stores and charity
shops for about 85 cents apiece. Another 2 million larger models for
trucks, taxis and cars went for a pound _ about $1.72 _ apiece, and
some even adorned the noses of British airplanes.
   Never have so many acted so silly for those with so little: even
the statue of Prime Minister Winston Churchill outside Parliament
sported a red nose.
   Comic Relief, the coalition of comedians and aid groups
organizing the event, hoped to top the $27 million raised last year
through the first Red Nose Day's sponsored antics, donations and
purchases of noses.
   Two-thirds of the money raised will go to Third World projects
and the Save the Children Fund, and the rest to programs in Britain
to help young people and the elderly.
   ``There's a lot of silliness in people that you tend not to let
out because you're afraid of what others will say,'' said Linda
Robbins, owner of a pub in Swansea, south Wales, where four people
in formal dress were dining outdoors in the garden atop eight tons
of manure.
   ``But on a day like today we can all do it and it's for a good
cause,'' she said as workers carted in the last of the dung.
   The two couples washed down a three-course meal with champagne,
and hoped to earn about $1,200 for Comic Relief.
   Elsewhere, two Welsh men dined on sheep's eyes, lamb's intestines
and clotted pig's blood _ the worst meal they could think of _ to
raise about $340.
   Youth worker Paul Ingham and three friends sat in a bath of cold
rice pudding in Norwich, Ian Hunt wallowed for 10 hours in a bathtub
of baked beans at a London pub, and others bathed in porridge.
   Residents of Clowne in central England, many dressed in clown
suits, declared the town an independent state, set up roadblocks and
demanded that incoming motorists pay ``chuckle money'' and buy noses.
   Two policemen sporting red noses and gnome costumes and two
colleagues with flashing blue lights on their helmets directed
traffic in Leytonstone, east London.
   Other policemen were enlisted by seven women students from
London's Westminster College who raced around kissing bobbies, and
being kissed, to earn about $515.
   Some treated officialdom less pleasantly. Tax collectors in
Durham stood in the stocks while being pelted with wet sponges.
British Rail workers in one office were given the opportunity to
throw custard at their bosses, although only about $70 was raised.
   ``I don't know if people felt their jobs were at risk if they did
it,'' said Phil Matthews, an organizer.
   Virgin Atlantic airline put them on their jets and incoming
passengers were warned of the day at London's Gatwick Airport.
``Announcements are being made on the aircraft about Comic Relief in
case the Americans think we've gone completely mad,'' said an
airport spokesman.
   The BBC televised a seven-hour comedy extravaganza with more than
100 personalities to mark the day.
   The Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, joined in the fun
by sporting a red nose on her ponytail ribbon.
   But Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused to don a nose which
an 11-year-old boy handed her as she toured an inner city revival
project in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens will meet
with President Bush on Monday to discuss the Middle East peace
efforts and other issues of interest to the region, the White House
announced Friday.
   Arens will also meet with Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and with members of Congress during his three-day trip to
Washington, said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said Bush did not have any new Middle East peace
initiatives to suggest to Arens.
   He declined to be specific about what Bush might bring up. Topics
could include the recent State Department human rights report that
criticized Israel's armed forces for excessive violence in putting
down Palestinian uprisings in the occupied territories.
   Arens' visit comes as the Israeli army shifts some of its troops
out of Gaza Strip refugee camps to reduce tension and fatal clashes
in the teeming Palestinian communities.
   Arens, a member of the conservative Likud party, has more
hardline views on dealing with the Palestinians than more moderate
Israeli leaders have. He has criticized a move by the European
Community to organize an international peace conference for the
region.
   The Bush administration also is cool to the idea.
   Arens also has chided the United States, where he grew up, for
opening talks for the first time with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which he accuses of being involved in interntional
terrorism.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir also is expected to visit the
United States in April.

   Actor Sylvester Stallone injured his knee while
filming some football sequences for his new movie and had it checked
at an orthopedic hospital, his publicist said Friday.
   ``The doctor told him his football career is probably over,''
joked Andrea Jaffe. ``No, really, he's fine. He just went to the
hospital. He wasn't rushed there or anything. ... They just bandaged
it up and he's going back to work.''
   Jaffe said Stallone, 42, was shooting scenes for his new movie
``Hard Time'' at Rahway State Prison in New Jersey on Wednesday and
refused to use a double during the hard-hitting sequence which has
inmates playing football, sans protective equipment.
   ``They were doing a lot of tight shots and he was going for that
realism, so he wanted to do it himself,'' Jaffe said. ``He took a
hard hit.''
   The next day when he woke up, his knee was stiff and he went to a
Manhattan hospital to have doctors look at it.
   She said he had no scenes to shoot on Thursday but would be at
work Friday night.

   Ris was moved to action by reports of a Gumbel memo to NBC brass

   ``My feeling is that the people in the networks get kind of

<HEAD>Government Warns Detainees Against Resuming Hunger Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Friday
threatened to crack down on anti-apartheid activists allegedly
trying to revive a mass hunger strike by detainees.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok cited six organziations that
he said were planning to restart a protest fast next week in Durban,
Port Elizabeth and other cities.
   ``Should unrest flare up again or should a single person die as a
result of the hunger strike, the organizations and persons fomenting
these campaigns will have to bear the responsibility for their
devilish deeds,'' Vlok said.
   The organizations named by Vlok included the recently formed
Hunger Striker's Support Committee and the Congress of South African
Trade Unions, the country's largest black labor federation.
   Detainees in Johannesburg began the hunger strike Jan. 23 to
demand that they be freed or put on trial. The strike spread to
other cities, but was suspended in most prisons after Vlok told
church leaders Feb. 16 that he would release a ``substantial
number'' of detainees.
   The government says it has freed 279 detainees since then, while
about 500 people remain held without charge. Anti-apartheid groups
say fewer people have been released and contend about 700 still are
in detention.
   On Friday, the Association of Democratic Journalists announced
the release of free-lance journalist Brian Sokutu, who had been held
for the entire 33 months of the emergency. Like many of those
released, Sokutu is under restriction orders. He is not allowed to
attend any meetings that criticize the government.
   Anti-apartheid leaders accuse Vlok of not keeping his promises,
saying he had given the impression he would release at least half of
those held without charge.
   ``Our hopes for a new attitude on the part of the police and the
government have not been realized,'' said Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu and Stephen Naidoo, the Roman Catholic archbishop of
Cape Town.
   ``The crisis precipitated by the government's
detention-without-trial laws is intensifying,'' their statement
added.
   As many as 500 detainees have participated in the hunger strike,
but only about 20 in the port city of Durban currently are fasting.
Neither the detainees nor any anti-apartheid organization have
publicly called for a new mass hunger strike, but they have warned
it could resume if the government does not release most of those in
detention.
   An estimated 30,000 people, almost all black, have been detained
without charge for varying lengths of time during the 33-month state
of emergency.

   The assistant manager of a grocery store
said he was skeptical when a well-dressed man said he was rushing to
catch a plane and needed a favor.
   ``I don't know. What's the favor?'' Don Baker said he asked the
man who appeared at Chicotsky Fine Foods on Thursday.
   ``Well, you'll like it,'' said the man before peeling off $1,000
in $100 bills and instructing Baker to call the Loaves and Fishes
Soup Kitchen, which had been vandalized earlier in the week.
   ``Tell them they have $1,000 to pick up some groceries,'' the man
said.
   The businessman, who said he was the president of a floor-care
equipment business, told Baker he had shopped at Chicotsky's and
gave him a business card. Baker declined to identify him because ``I
don't think he was doing this for any publicity purpose.''
   Helen Voldness, director of the Loaves and Fishes Metroplex Food
Bank that supplies the kitchen, said the donation will allow the
kitchen to restock after vandals broke in earlier in the week,
forcing it to close for the first time in its seven years.

   Fourth- and fifth-graders whose junk food
favorites have jumped in price by 100 percent say desperate times
call for desperate measures.
   Indignant at prices hiked from 25 cents to 50 cents for cafeteria
snacks such as ice cream or potato chips, the youngsters are staging
a boycott.
   ``If everyone stops buying for a week, it will take them a while
to recover,'' said Jacob Berlin, a fourth-grader at Claypit Hill
School.
   Students at the school in the Boston suburb began their protest
last month with a petition drive.
   That failed, and the 9- through 11-year-olds decided to get tough.
   ``It's not noticeable enough (a protest) to say, `Wow, prices are
going up,'' Jacobs said.
   Students feel some increase would be reasonable, but 100 percent
was too much, he said.
   The food service annual budget of $350,000 for four schools
relies on cafeteria revenues, and the price hike was necessary to
make up for losses suffered because of a shrinking number of
students in the upper grades to patronize the high school snack bar,
said Lillian Mills, who runs food services for the Wayland school
system.
   Early accounts show snack sales at Claypit Hill are down, Ms.
Mills said.
   While teachers have tried not to interfere, fourth-grade teacher
Rick Colpitts said he used the protest for classroom discussions on
economics and the uses of petitions and boycotts.
   ``As a teacher, I'm proud that they were able to take an issue
and mobilize around it,'' Colpitts said Thursday. ``I think it was
good that they were able to stand up and try to change things _
peacefully.''

   The Miracles, the Spinners, a former Supreme and
an ex-Temptation are among the singers a British record producer
hopes to gather for a recording session next week to recapture the
legendary Motown sound.
   Ian Levine, who owns and operates London-based Nightmare Records,
said Thursday he expects about 21 former Motown acts for the session
at Detroit's United Sound studio.
   The performers will record new songs instead of ``regurgitating
the same old stuff,'' he said. In addition to the Miracles and
Spinners, participants will include the Marvelettes, the
Velvelettes, former Supreme Mary Wilson, ex-Temptation David Ruffin
and Junior Walker, he said.
   Motown, founded in Detroit by Berry Gordy, has been sold and now
is based in Los Angeles.

   ``You can never really go as far or
go as deep as you would like to. So there's always something else to
try for,'' actor Gregory Peck told the star-studded crowd that had
turned out to salute him.
   Peck, 72, who joked that he was ``entirely too young'' for the
honor, was given the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement
Award Thursday night.
   The tribute will be telecast on NBC on March 21.
   Jane Fonda, who stars with Peck in ``Old Gringo,'' which has not
yet been released, told the audience, ``I may not be his first
leading lady or his last, but I certainly got him at his ripest.''
   Audrey Hepburn, who co-starred with Peck in ``Roman Holiday,''
was host of the black-tie event at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, which
attracted such stars as Lauren Bacall, Virginia Mayo, Dorothy
McGuire, Liza Minnelli, Jennifer Jones, Charlton Heston, Dinah Shore

   Jessica Hahn, whose 1980 tryst with
television evangelist Jim Bakker brought down the PTL ministry, says
her childhood dream was to be a preacher, not a Playboy centerfold.
   ``I never thought about modeling,'' Hahn, a former church
secretary, said of her early ambitions. ``I thought my whole life
was being in the church.
   ``I eventually saw myself preaching, but not the way you see
preachers preach. The people I always wanted to reach were
teen-agers,'' said Hahn, now seeking work as a disc jockey after a
brief stint at a Phoenix radio station. She was in western lower
Michigan Wednesday for a radio station promotion.
   Hahn, 29, said she is bothered by criticism of her appearances in
Playboy and a suggestive music video with screaming comic Sam
Kinison.
   ``What really disturbs me is when people criticize me for taking
chances or taking advantage of opportunities,'' she said. `` ...
When people are given a chance in life, I believe God is opening the
door and you have to walk through it.''

   Queen Elizabeth II gave her youngest son, Prince
Edward, a special 25th birthday present Friday _ his first royal
honor.
   The queen made him a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, an
order of chivalry instituted in 1896 by Queen Victoria to reward
services to the royal family. Edward is now entitled to use the
initials CVO after his name.
   Edward, who works as a production assistant for Andrew Lloyd
Webber's Really Useful Theatre Company, was spending his birthday
working in the company's offices at the Palace Theater on its
production of Lloyd Webber's new musical ``Aspects of Love.''
   His older brother, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, was made a
CVO by the queen in 1979 to mark the start of his career in the
Royal Navy. He is now a lieutenant.
   In 1974, his sister, Princess Anne, was made a Knight Grand Cross
of the order _ its highest rank _ to reward her courage during an
attempted abduction from her car which she helped foil.

   Robert H. Bork, the rejected Supreme
Court nominee, and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the Pulitzer
Prize-winning author, reached a consensus only once during their
appearance at Pacific University.
   Schlesinger drew chuckles during Thursday night's debate when he
observed that he and Bork had thus far agreed only on the importance
of dry martini, a subject they discussed in private earlier in the
evening.
   Bork, 62, who resigned from his bench on the U.S. Court of
Appeals last year and is now a resident scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., was adamant that the court
was growing dangerously powerful.
   ``What I object to are judges who are making up moral principles
that have no foundation in the Constitution whatsoever,'' he said.
   Schlesinger, 71, former special assistant to President John F.
Kennedy and currently the Albert Schweitzer Professor of Humanities
at City University of New York, argued that the original
understanding of the framers of the U.S. Constitution included the
implicit power for Supreme Court justices to adapt general
principles to changing circumstances.

   Hurricane-force winds that have hampered
the search for three missing Japanese climbers on Mount McKinley
abated somewhat Friday, and an Air Force pilot saw a flash of red or
orange as he flew near the continent's tallest peak.
   Maj. Neal Sharra radioed, however, that he saw no movement in the
area along the missing men's likely route, and officials cautioned
the color might be a box of emergency provisions left for climbers
in trouble.
   The three climbers, who were last seen Feb. 22 while attempting a
rare wintertime ascent of the 20,320-mountain, are equipped with
orange tents and were wearing identical red climbing suits.
   Rescuers were waiting Friday for the wind to die down, hoping
they could fly helicopters near the mountain for a more extensive
search. The Air Force observation plane that saw the color had been
sent up primarily to monitor visibility and turbulence.
   Bob Seibert, a mountaineering ranger with the National Park
Service, said the search, once winds allow it to begin, would first
concentrate on the place where the color was spotted.
   Rescuers were ready to board aircraft early Thursday, but they
remained in Talkeetna hour after hour as winds that at times topped
90 mph persisted around Mount McKinley, 65 miles to the northwest.
   By Friday morning, Seibert said, the weather ``looks different
than it has for the past week and a half. I feel better (about it)
than I did yesterday.''
   Chief Warrant Officer Myron Babcock, leader of the Army rescue
team, agreed that the winds were not as bad, ``but they're still
twice as high as we'd like them to be.''
   The climbers' rations probably ran out days ago, but the Park
Service has a cache of food, fuel and water at 17,200 feet along
with a semi-permanent ice cave, officials said.
   ``If they stayed put (at 17,200 camp), they'd be fine,'' said
Roger Robinson, a Park Service mountaineering ranger. ``The
resources there are phenomenal.''
   It was that brightly colored box of provisions that might have
caught the eye of the pilot, Seibert said.
   The Japanese last were seen by a three-man Austrian climbing
team. The Austrians were descending the mountain, and the Japanese
were climbing. There have been six successful winter ascents since
1967, with four climber deaths during that period, the Park Service
says.
   Although the Japanese are equipped with a radio, its use and
range is limited. ``They have a little FM radio,'' Robinson said.
``It's pretty restrictive as to who you can talk to.''
   Members of the Japanese party are leader Noboru Yamada, 39, Teruo
Saegusa, 31, and Kozo Komatsu, 34, all of Tokyo.

<HEAD>Carlucci Defends Fighter Jet Deal with Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said
Friday that the Pentagon had not sold out U.S. economic interests in
agreeing to transfer to Japan technology for building an advanced
version of the F-16 fighter.
   ``It is my judgment that the FSX represents a good deal for
Japan, a good deal for the United States and an excellent deal for
the U.S.-Japan security and industrial relationship,'' Carlucci told
a Senate Armed Services subcommittee.
   He asserted that ``in the end, much of the criticism of the FSX
deal reflects an irrational fear of Japan's technological prowess.''
   Under the deal, St. Louis-based General Dynamics would join
forces with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to co-develop and
co-produce a next-generation fighter, called the FSX, for deployment
by Japan in the late 1990s.
   Proponents argue that the agreement represents the best deal the
United States could negotiate in the face of Japanese opposition to
buying F-16s directly from the United States. They say the deal will
serve to promote beneficial technology transfer in both directions
while generating income and jobs for U.S. industry.
   Critics, however, contend that the arrangement amounts to a
giveaway of advanced technology that Japan may use to help propel
its civilian aircraft industry into head-to-head competition with
the United States in the world market. They say Tokyo should
purchase American-made planes to help offset the $50 billion U.S.
trade deficit with Japan.
   In the face of congressional criticism, the Bush administration
has been conducting an interagency review of the FSX deal prior to
sending the agreement to Capitol Hill.
   At the White House, officials said the National Security Council
expected to receive Friday the results of the review, handled mainly
by the Pentagon and the Commerce Department.
   ``We expect the review will be completed and we won't have a
presidential decision for some time,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater. He said President Bush would examine the issue
next week.
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the defense industry and
technology subcommittee, told the hearing, ``I believe that the
process whereby this agreement was reached was flawed in that the
departments of State and Defense systematically excluded from the
negotiations the agencies which deal with our economic and trade
policies.''
   ``The fundamental decision at the start of these negotiations was
not to link our defense and trade relations. That decision was
unsustainable,'' he said.
   Bingaman is among 21 senators co-sponsoring a sense-of-the-Senate
resolution that expresses ``strong reservations'' about the FSX
deal. Also, a group of 24 House members has sent a letter to Bush
saying they intend to fight the agreement when it goes to Capitol
Hill.
   Carlucci told the panel that the FSX deal is not ``an agreement
which sells out U.S. economic interests for the sake of purely
military or strategic interests.''
   ``In fact ... our Defense and State negotiators were well aware
of the economic equities at stake and proceeded from the view that
economic security is a cornerstone of our future national
security,'' he testified.
   He added that officials conducting the interagency review also
``will not find that our negotiators `lost their shirts' or `gave
away the store' on technology transfer, as has been alleged by
some.''

<TEXT>
   Iran's parliament speaker said Friday
``The Satanic Verses'' had created history's strangest crisis, and
he offered a simple solution: Burn all existing copies of the book
and ban it forever.
   A dispatch from the official Iranian news agency did not say
whether Hashemi Rafsanjani commented on Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's order of Feb. 14 that his followers kill the author,
Salman Rushdie, for blaspheming Islam.
   Unless the novel is destroyed and banned, Rafsanjani said during
Friday prayers at Tehran University, ``it will remain forever a
source of rebellion and it would be impossible that peace would come
between real Moslems and the supporters of this book.''
   He said the solution to ``the strangest and rarest crisis in
history is to issue a strict order to seize all copies in the entire
world and burn them,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Rushdie, a naturalized citizen of Britain, was born to Moslem
parents in Bombay, India, but has said he no longer practices
religion. The 41-year-old author went into hiding after the Khomeini
pronounced the death sentence and Iranian religious leaders added a
reward of $5.2 million.
   Moslems say a scene in ``The Satanic Verses'' in which
prostitutes take the names of Mohammed's wives, and suggestions that
the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than receiving it from
Allah, blaspheme Mohammed and Islam.
   Most nations in the Middle East have banned the book, as have
Asian countries with large Moslem populations. At least 19 people
were killed in riots about it in India and Pakistan.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with Britain on Tuesday because
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government refused to suppress
the novel.
   She and her foreign minister, Sir Geoffrey Howe, said they
realized Rushdie's book offends Moslems but insisted Khomeini's
execution order be revoked and freedom of expression respected.
   The dispute opened a new rift between Iran and the West, to which
more moderate elements in Tehran had looked for trade and assistance
in rebuilding from the eight-year war with Iraq.
   Britain's 11 partners in the European Economic Community, joined
by Canada, Norway and Sweden, recalled their ambassadors from
Tehran. Britain says it will deport nine former Iranian Embassy
employees if they do not leave the country within 10 days.
   Rafsanjani was a leader in openings to the West and has been
considered the Iran's most powerful figure after Khomeini, the
88-year-old revolutionary patriarch.
   He castigated Britain in his speech Friday. They ``didn't have
the guts to say `We also did wrong, we supported (Rushdie), we too
are guilty','' he declared.
   ``Their pride didn't allow them to say the truth. If those who
ignited this flame do not find a suitable solution, who knows where
it will lead?''
   A Tehran radio commentary said outrage over ``The Satanic
Verses'' would not abate and warned of ``retaliatory action'' if
Britain deported the Iranians.
   ``There are currently present in Iran persons who ... are engaged
in spying for Britain and undoubtedly it is Britain who will be the
loser as the result of retaliatory measures,'' the radio said.
   It mentioned British businessmen Roger Cooper, 52, a longtime
resident of Iran jailed in Tehran two years ago on espionage
charges. The radio said Cooper had made ``revelations'' about
undercover activities in Islamic countries ``that can greatly
disgrace Britain.''
   In Turkey, a secular Moslem state, police detained dozens of
demonstrators Friday after protests to denounce Rushdie and his
novel. Protesters chanted ``Down with Europe, America and Israel!''
and ``Death to Salman Rushdie!''

<HEAD>Calendar Aimed At Helping Needy Farmers Is Going Under</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An organization that set out to help needy
farmers through sales of a calendar featuring young, bachelor
farmers is folding, a state official said.
   Food Inc.'s debts ``far outweigh the meager assets that they
have'' and it is unable to pay its bills, James Vukelic, North
Dakota's solicitor general, said Thursday.
   Food Inc., which stands for Farmers Of Ongoing Determination,
produced a calendar called ``Dakota Men,'' which pictured a young
man for each month. The 1988 calendar featured North Dakota farmers.
The '89 issue contains farmers from both Dakotas.
   The venture was launched in 1987 but ran into serious trouble
last year when an audit revealed that some of the $175,508 raised
from the sale of the first calendars in 1988 had been spent on
questionable expenses, including parties, and none went to charities.
   The state attorney general's office filed suit against the
organization charging it with mismanagement and misrepresentation. A
settlement was reached last December whereby Food Inc. could
continue operating under certain restrictions and close supervision
by the state.
   However, the matter severely damaged sales of the 1989 calendar.
Roger Jaeger, an Esmond farmer who is executive director of Food
Inc., said 1989 sales were not what the organization expected.
   Vukelic said the state was concerned now about the liquidation of
the organization.
   ``When we were informed by representatives of Food Inc. that they
intended to shut down their operation, we were primarily concerned
in seeing that the assets of the corporation were liquidated and we
want to oversee that process,'' he said.
   The state has not been provided with all the specifics on Food
Inc.'s assets, Vukelic said.
   Jaeger said he hoped to have more details about the
organization's shut down later this month.

   Iran on Friday hanged 81 people, including
three Afghans and two women, who were convicted on drug smuggling
charges, state-run Tehran radio reported.
   The executions took place in Tehran and 26 other cities.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said those executed were
found guilty of possession and sale of more than 11 tons of heroin,
opium, hashish and other narcotics.
   In addition to the drug charges, some of the condemned also were
found guilty of other crimes, such as theft, illegal possesion of
arms, kidnapping, and committing ``indecent acts in contravention to
Islamic law,'' the radio said.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the two women were
hanged in the capital's Qasr prison.
   ``I hope narcotics will be weeded out in this country. I ask the
youth to take lesson from our fate,'' said Reza Shamlou, 24, before
his death, according to IRNA, also monitored in Cyprus.
   The Iranian daily newspaper Ettelaat expressed support for the
anti-drug campaign, but carried a commentary by Ayatollah Hussein
Ali Montazeri, Khomeini's designated successor, who said ``poverty,
the root of social corruption, should be given great consideration
if the problem is to be successfully solved.''
   Friday's executions bring to 356 the number of executions
reported by Iran since a new anti-drugs law went into effect Jan 21.
The previous high toll for one day was 70 executions on Feb. 14.
   The new law carries the death sentence for possession of even
small quantities of drugs, and gives addicts six months to kick the
habit or face jail terms.
   Earlier this week, the radio quoted an unidentified source at the
country's main law enforcement agency, the Komiteh, who said the
six-month grace period granted to addicts to kick the habit would
expire July 23, after which they will be subject to prosecution.
   The Komiteh official said the amount of drugs seized during the
current Iranian year, which ends March 21, totals more than 50 tons,
Tehran radio said.

<HEAD>Bush Plunges into Search for Tower Replacement, Quayle Turns up Heat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush plunged anew into the search for
a defense secretary Friday, reviewing names and asking about
candidates less than 24 hours after the Senate killed his nomination
of John Tower.
   In sharp contrast to Bush's low-keyed reaction to his first
legislative defeat, Vice President Dan Quayle turned up the heat and
accused Senate Democrats of engaging in ``a McCarthyite mud-slinging
campaign'' against Tower and waging an ``assault on the powers of
the presidency.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged ``there
is some difference in tone'' between Bush and Quayle. Bush had said,
``We owe it to the American people to come together and move
forward.''
   White House officials said Bush would pick a replacement quickly.
He sought advice on the nomination in telephone calls and in
meetings with people he trusts, said Fitzwater.
   Many potential candidates were mentioned, including former Rep.
Jack Edwards, R-Ala., Sens. William Cohen, R-Maine and Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, former defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and James
Schlesinger, former CIA deputy director Bobby Inman, Paul O'Neill,
chairman and chief executive officer of Alcoa, and Norman Augustine,
chairman and chief executive officer of Martin Marietta Aerospace
Corp.
   Edwards' law office said he wasn't interested in the job, and
Augustine let it be known that neither was he.
   Cohen said the talk about him was just ``unfounded rumors.''
Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, said
Thursday he wouldn't get the job but his name was still being
mentioned.
   Cohen speculated that the next nominee would be ``someone who's
gone through a recent (FBI) check. (The nominee) must be
well-respected and able to work in a constructive way with
Congress.''
   Fitzwater, at a late-morning briefing, said, ``The president is
reviewing candidates both in terms of receiving names from any
number of people and sources in the government, in the White House
and outside the government as well.
   ``He has asked that several of them be checked out in one fashion
or another in terms of availability or interest as well as
background.''
   Fitzwater refused to say how far the field had been narrowed but
said, ``You may be assured the search is intense and is being
carried by a number of people as rapidly as possible.''
   The main reason the search was expected to go quickly was because
Bush went through the same drill before choosing Tower last December.
   ``It's not like we're starting from scratch,'' Fitzwater said.
``Basically there's a large group of people to consider off that bat
that they've gone through in quite detail before,'' he said. Other
names were being added, he said.
   Bush will meet over the weekend at Camp David with the Joint
Chiefs of Staff for previously scheduled talks on defense issues,
but Fitzwater said the president did not have to talk with them
before making a decision.
   Meanwhile, Quayle flew to Indianapolis and, in a prepared speech,
harshly criticized Senate Democrats and warned there will be a
lingering bitterness over the Tower fight.
   ``Never in all my years in the Senate have I encountered anything
like the feeling of outrage that exists today among my former
Republican Senate colleagues,'' he said. ``Never have I encountered
such anger and bitterness in the Senate chamber.''
   Quayle said ``the harmful consequences of the Tower affair will
not soon pass. I'm afraid that the misguided Democratic assault on
the powers of the presidency will continue.''
   He said the Democrats, losers in five of the last six
presidential elections, have ``set out to undermine the presidency
by encroaching on its powers.''
   At the White House, Fitzwater said Quayle had given a copy of the
speech to the White House on Thursday but that he did not have to
have his remarks cleared in advance.
   Fitzwater said he did not think Bush had read the speech.
However, Bush and Quayle talked over lunch on Thursday. ``The
president is aware of the vice president's views.''
   Commenting on different tactics adopted by Bush and Quayle,
Fitzwater said, ``I think the Senate understands these positions.
... I think everyone understands where they're both coming from.''
   In another development, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the leader of the
fight to defeat Tower's nomination, struck a conciliatory note,
saying ``I hope the passions that are now bubbling in Washington
will soon cool.''
   Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said, ``We cannot
prevail as a great power if either our allies or our adversaries
look to Washington and see endless division and rancor instead of a
principled, unified American policy.''

   The Israeli army removed some troops from Gaza
Strip refugee camps Friday in a bid to reduce tension and fatal
clashes in the teeming Palestinian communities, the military said.
   The moves came as Foreign Minister Moshe Arens left for a 10-day
visit to the United States, where officials are expected to press
for less violence in Israel's effort to halt the 15-month
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arens is to meet Monday with President Bush and Secretary of
State James Baker. He is expected to seek U.S. support for efforts
to bring peace to the occupied lands.
   In clashes Friday in the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Rafah, troops
shot and killed 22-year-old Suher Lutfi al Hams, Arab reports said.
   Arab reporters and hospital officials said at least 15
Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the occupied lands. An army
official confirmed the death and seven wounded, and said he was
checking the other injury reports.
   The death brought to 394 the number of Palestinians killed since
the start of the uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied
lands. Seventeen Israelis, including six soldiers, also have died.
   Israel has controlled the territories since it captured them from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   By removing some troops from refugee camps, the government is
shifting the emphasis on its policy from a widespread army presence
in the lands to fewer but better-trained anti-riot units.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, commander of the Gaza region, told
the daily Hebrew Haaretz the changes are meant to ease friction
between soldiers and Palestinians.
   The occupied territories are home to more than 1.7 million
Palestinians.
   Gaza Strip reporters said the army on Friday moved troops out of
the Jabaliya refugee camp. Soldiers also continued for a second day
to move out of the Shati refugee camp to posts near the entrance
gates, Arab reporters said.
   Residents of Gaza City said they saw fewer army patrols, despite
a general strike called by the underground leadership of the
uprising.
   Jabaliya, where the uprising began, is the Gaza's largest refugee
camp, with nearly 54,000 residents, according to figures from the
United Nations. It is just northeast of Gaza City.
   Shati has more than 42,000 refugee residents, according to the
U.N. figures. It is on the Mediterranean Sea inside Gaza City.
   A military source, who insisted on anonymity, said more troops
would be moved next week in the Gaza Strip and in a few trouble
spots in the West Bank, including the town of Qalqilya.
   As part of the moves, fewer reserve army troops will be sent to
the territories. Instead, increased paramilitary Border Police units
and specially trained mechanized infantry battalions will be more
widely used.
   ``The ultimate goal will be fewer fatalities, which is something
everybody wants,'' an army official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said in an interview.
   He said Border Police officers are trained in riot control and
that ``they have caused far fewer fatalities per incident than the
army.''
   The officers, two-third of whom are Israeli Arabs, have a
reputation for relying on wooden batons and tear-gas to scatter
demonstrators rather than guns. ``They seem to get their message
across without opening fire,'' the army official said.
   He said more Border Police have been recruited to deal with the
uprising, but declined to give figures. The mechanized infantry
units, which will operate as mobile strike forces, will not be ready
until April, he said.
   Elsewhere in Gaza on Friday, the army destroyed rooms in the
homes of three Palestinians from the Khan Yunis refugee camp who
were suspected of throwing firebombs at Arab collaborators, an army
commander told Army radio.
   ``I hope tomorrow when the local population gets up and sees the
destroyed rooms it will serve as a warning and there will be less
violence,'' said the commander, who was not identified by name in
keeping with military policy.
   The radio broadcast the sounds of bulldozers smashing into
concrete amid protest whistling and jeering by Palestinians.

   College students, businessmen and bargain hunters
piled aboard the Eastern Airlines shuttle Friday, many saying that
while they felt guilty about crossing a picket line, the $12 fare _
down from $99 _ was too good to miss.
   ``I feel like a scab,'' said John Brousseau of Worcester, a
wastewater treatment plant worker. ``I belong to two unions, but for
the price I just bite my tongue.''
   Others aboard the no-reservation link between Boston, New York
and Washington said they were admirers of Frank Lorenzo, owner of
Eastern parent Texas Air. The striking Machinists union and pilots
supporting the strike blame Lorenzo for Eastern's problems.
   ``I think the unions are wrong anyways. They're crippling the
airlines,'' said Peter Rogina, 33, of Salem, a sales manager who
prefers to fly Pan Am. ``Some baggage handlers are getting paid $40
an hour to unload planes. That's ridiculous.''
   The Eastern employees staffing the planes rolled out the red
carpet, extending more than the usual welcome to the first crowd of
passengers since the week-old strike began. Shuttle flights earlier
in the week had been mostly empty.
   ``I'm glad we have a good crowd even though we're giving it
away,'' the pilot joked over the intercom.
   The pilot, a 26-year Eastern veteran, said $12 was the price of
Eastern's very first shuttle in 1961. The offer is good through
Sunday. The airline announced it will cut regular week-day fares to
$49 next week.
   Early flights were less than half-filled, despite fares cheaper
than a taxi to the airport in two of the nation's costliest cities.
The 8 a.m. shuttle from Boston to New York carried 140 people in a
plane that holds 250.
   The 10 a.m. return trip to Boston, with the same plane and crew,
carried 73 passengers. Pilots on both sides of the picket lines said
those numbers were roughly average for the airline before the strike.
   Traffic on late-morning flights was heavier.
   Eastern managers said they hoped for more passengers as word
spread that the shuttles were flying despite the company's
declaration of bankruptcy Thursday.
   Roger Howlett, an art dealer in Boston and New York, said the
uncertainty almost kept him away. He told a flight attendant the
airline would have more takers if it ran radio updates on the
shuttle's status.
   ``You don't know if they're flying or not,'' he said. ``I tried
to call 50 times before I left but the line was busy.''
   Pickets outside the Eastern terminal at Boston's Logan airport
urged travelers to resist the low fares and hospitality.
   ``It's just another one of Frank Lorenzo's tactics so he can say
the shuttle's full,'' said Norma Henson, a 20-year Eastern flight
attendant.

   An Air Ontario jet with 69 people aboard
crashed Friday shortly after taking off from Dryden airport, an
airline official said.
   Paul McKnight, vice president of the Toronto-based regional
carrier, said some people survived the crash, but he couldn't say
how many. CKPR radio, which had reporters at the scene, said about
30 people were taken to a hospital.
   McKnight said there was a fire aboard the plane, but it was not
immediately clear whether the fire occurred before or after the
crash.
   Sixty-five passengers and four crew members were aboard the
Fokker F-28 jet when it crashed into trees after taking off on a
noon flight to Winnipeg, Manitoba, he said. The radio reporters said
rescue workers bulldozed a passage through the woods to reach the
crash site.
   Dryden, a town of 6,500 people on the Trans-Canada Highway, is
about 200 miles northwest of Duluth, Minn.

<TEXT>
   Britain's Queen Elizabeth II told
thousands of high school students an education is not enough unless
it's ``reinforced by the desire to help others.''
   The Queen, in Barbados as the guest of honor in celebrations
marking the 350th anniversary of the island nation's Parliament,
laid the stone for a new building at Queen's College.
   ``In a world which is becoming all the time more and more
interdependent, the knowledge and skills which you acquire here will
give the best return only if they are reinforced by a desire to
serve others,'' the queen told high school students who came from 35
schools.
   She pointed to the Commonwealth, of which Barbados is a member,
as a good example of ``working together for the common good.''
   ``It's members belong to different cultures, climates beliefs and
ideals but we have seized unto the essential idea of working
together for the common good,'' she said. ``We have the unique
advantage of feeling at home where we may go within the
Commonwealth.''
   The queen praised the reputation of the school which she said had
been built on longstanding traditions of excellence and achievement.
   Her husband, Prince Philip, presented 34 students with awards
given to youths who have made good deeds and ``constructive use of
leisure time.''
   Earlier, the queen knighted social worker Clyde Gollop and
businessman Stanley Blanchette.
   The queen last visited this former British colony in 1985. The
island, with a population of 270,000, is dependent mostly on
tourism. It gained its independence in 1966.
   The royal couple return to Britain on Saturday.

<HEAD>Government Agrees With Whistleblowers, Joins Civil Lawsuit Against
Northrop</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A defense contractor faked testing of vital
guidance components for the Air Force's cruise missile, the
government alleged in joining a $63 million lawsuit brought by
whistleblowing ex-employees.
   The lawsuit, unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court, accuses
Northrop Corp. of falsifying test results on parts for nearly 1,800
of the nuclear-tipped missiles, which are launched from bombers and
skim the earth toward their targets.
   ``These are critical guidance and flight control systems parts
for the air-launched cruise missile,'' said Mary McMenimen,
spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office here. ``These units are
on B-52 and B-1 bombers stationed both in the U.S. and overseas.''
   The cruise missile is a subsonic, jet-powered missile with small
wings. It is designed to fly close to terrain to avoid radar
detection, and can carry conventional or nuclear warheads. It has a
range of up to 1,500 miles.
   When the government entered the case Feb. 15, the company asked
the judge to keep the lawsuit sealed. After hearing arguments on the
motion Thursday, Judge David Kenyon ruled against the company.
   An attorney for the whistleblowers, Herbert Hafif, said Northrop
sought to keep the lawsuit closed to protect its corporate image.
   Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio cited a November 1987 General
Accounting Office report stating the guidance system was ``reliable
and will perform its intended mission.''
   The corporation fired a plant manager and three employees after
the aerospace firm ``discovered irregularities in the tests,''
Cantafio added.
   The lawsuit was filed in 1987 under the False Claims Act, which
allows whistleblowers to share damage awards with the government. It
was joined by the Justice Department last month, a move the
government makes if it determines the allegations have merit.
   The Air Force is ``evaluating the evidence in order to determine
whether corrective action needs to be taken to assure their
reliability,'' McMenimen said.
   An attorney for the private plaintiffs, fired Northrop workers
Leocadio Barajas and Patricia Meyer, said the workers were told to
falsify test results. The attorney, Rob Kilbourne, alleged the faked
tests mean the performance of the parts, called flight data
recorders, is suspect.
   ``Northrop has delivered a guidance system for a nuclear weapons
system that very well may not work if used. That is the bottom
line,'' Kilbourne said.
   The lawsuit alleges that Northrop falsely certified it had
performed critical stress tests on flight data transmitters for
1,764 missiles between 1981 and 1986. Los Angeles-based Northrop
supplies the transmitters to Boeing Corp. of Seattle, which makes
the missiles.
   Production of the $9,000-per-missile guidance systems started in
El Monte and moved later to Pomona, 20 miles east of downtown Los
Angeles.
   A federal grand jury in Los Angeles is conducting a separate
criminal investigation of the alleged fake tests, the Los Angeles
Times reported.
   Northrop Vice Chairman Frank Lynch admitted during a 1987
congressional hearing that the stress tests, designed to expose them
to heat and cold to screen out defective units, were falsified and
that employees reported it to superiors.
   ``Unfortunately, the manager of the plant was involved in the
falsification of tests,'' Lynch testified.
   The U.S. Attorney's Office, entering the lawsuit, accused
Northrop with breach of contract and fraud. The act allows the
government to seek $60 million, three times the actual damages, and
$3 million in civil penalties, Ms. McMenimen said.
   In the civil lawsuit filed Nov. 2, 1987, Barajas said he was
instructed on what steps to take to make it appear the parts passed
certain tests.
   Ms. Meyer, a quality control inspector for Northrop, said she was
fired after rejecting parts and materials that didn't conform to
guidelines or were defective.

   Wedding postponed due to strike.
   Eastern Airlines flight attendant Janet Thollander and mechanic
Albert Eskridge had set their wedding for April 15.
   But after his Machinists union went on strike, and she and other
attendants and pilots honored the picket lines, they called their
families and friends to say the date had been postponed indefinitely.
   ``I had not had the photographer or the flowers because that you
have to put a deposit on,'' said Ms. Thollander, a 10-year Eastern
veteran. ``The restaurant where I was going to have the reception,
all I have to do is tell them to cancel. ... My dress still sits in
my closet.''
   She mailed job applications this week to three other airlines,
and Eskridge, a 12-year Eastern employee, submitted about 25
applications to other carriers, engine manufacturers and NASA.
   ``We've been eating hot dogs and hamburgers a lot,'' said Ms.
Thollander, wearing her Eastern uniform at a picket-duty desk at the
Machinists union hall. ``Hot dogs here and hamburgers at home.''
   Attendants honoring the Machinists picket line cannot collect any
strike benefits because the Transport Workers Union representing
5,900 Eastern attendants, including 2,000 in Miami, is not
technically on strike. Those who refuse to cross picket lines are
ineligible for unemployment benefits.
   About 1,500 Eastern employees are still being paid, but paychecks
for striking workers have been tied up in Bankruptcy Court with the
carrier's petition Thursday for Chapter 11 financial reorganization.
   Robert Ziller, a University of Florida psychology professor,
worried about the strike's potential for isolating and alienating
people cut off from their support system in the workplace.
   ``I'll bet they have some nice explanations that serve as a
support in this. I don't get the sense that they're throwing up
their hands at all yet,'' he said. ``There is a sense they're
fighting the good fight.''
   Financial consequences of the strike are blunted in two-income
families, Ziller noted.
   ``That curiously enough is a sort of economic parachute that
families have today. They're a little more independent with two
people working,'' he said. ``I'm sure they have looked at this hard,
and they're prepared to eat oatmeal for a year if necessary.''
   Many veteran attendants retired or took other jobs with the
strike looming, and many of those hit by the strike quickly went
job-hunting.
   Attendants have gone to work as a nurse, a dental hygienist,
waitresses and with companies offering temporary secretarial
services, Ms. Thollander said. A law school student is now
concentrating on her studies full-time.
   ``They always had a lot going for them,'' said Ms. Thollander.
``I'm sure people will be landing on their feet in different jobs.''
   She hopes to remain in Florida but will relocate if necessary.
She lists a Chicago condominium and her car as her primary assets,
adding: ``Most flight attendants don't have a lot of money saved.''

   Tensions are high at the overcrowded
immigration detention center where Central Americans, except
Nicaraguans, are being deported under strict new political asylum
measures, officials said.
   More than 2,000 undocumented aliens were crammed into dormitories
and tents Friday at the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
minimum-security Port Isabel Service Processing Center, 20 miles
northeast of the border city of Brownsville.
   ``I think there is an increase in tension,'' said INS spokeswoman
Virginia Kice. ``Our (detainee) population has increased fivefold in
the past two weeks.''
   Mark Schneider, an immigration attorney, said evidence of the
tension includes fistfights and ethnic slurs among the detainees.
   Earlier this week, INS officials stopped allowing reporters and
photographers into the 315-acre compound to avoid increasing ``the
level of excitement,'' Ms. Kice said.
   ``Our population is high, and our first responsiblity is the
welfare of our detainees and personnel,'' the INS spokeswoman said,
but added there had not been any violence at the center.
   The detainee population for months remained below 450 at the
rural facility before the crackdown on asylum applicants took
effect. On Feb. 21, the INS started a speeded-up procedure in which
asylum-seekers applications are processed quickly and those denied
refugee status are arrested and detained. Unless they appeal their
denial of asylum, detainees face quick deportation.
   Schneider, who visited clients at the center Thursday night,
said: ``The atmosphere is tense. People are vocally demanding more
food and medicine.''
   ``The overcrowding and the lack of information are making people
nervous,'' he said.
   Seventy Central Americans who were rejected for asylum here under
the new measures and did not appeal have been flown back to El
Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras since Sunday when the deportations
began, Ms. Kice said.
   ``We have not deported any Nicaraguans,'' she said. ``The Meese
directive still stands.''
   Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese in July 1987 issued a
directive calling for special treatment of Nicaraguan political
asylum cases, and for INS officials to ``encourage and expedite''
their applications for work authorization. Under the directive, few
Nicaraguans have been deported unless they had criminal records,
because the INS considers Marxist-ruled Nicaragua a totalitarian
nation.
   The INS Harlingen District at Texas' southern tip is referring
cases of Nicaraguans denied asylum to the Justice Department in
Washington.
   Of 473 asylum applications processed here since Feb. 21, only 36
had been approved as of Friday morning, and 35 of the 36 people were
Nicaraguans. The other was a Salvadoran.
   The INS began the get-tough measures in southern Texas to
discourage ``frivolous'' asylum applicants from traveling to the
United States, INS officials said.
   Political asylum is granted to those able to convince the federal
government that they are fleeing persecution. The INS maintains most
Central Americans come here for economic reasons and do not merit
political-refugee status, though critics say that the agency is too
quick to deny asylum from politically torn nations such as El
Salvador whose governments, unlike Nicaragua, are friendly to the
United States.
   More than 40,000 Central Americans have initiated asylum cases in
southern Texas after crossing the Rio Grande illegally since last
spring. Before Feb. 21, the INS allowed applicants not previously
apprehended by the Border Patrol to travel to their U.S.
destinations to pursue asylum claims.
   In addition to the more than 2,000 adults in detention at
Bayview, including nearly 400 in tents, the Justice Department had
more than 900 other people in custody at a Brownsville American Red
Cross shelter for family groups.

<TEXT>
   European Interior Ministers agreed Friday
on the need to create an intelligence exchange service to combat
problems arising from the planned elimination in four years of
borders in the 12-nation trade bloc.
   The officials did not discuss the scope or future evolution of
the service, said Spanish Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera.
   He said his fellow ministers asked Spain to prepare a document
outlining the service in time for a May 12-13 meeting of the Trevi
Group of Interior Ministers, created in 1976 to coordinate
anti-terrorist operations in the European Economic Community.
Interiors ministers from Greece, Spain and France will review the
document before the May meeting.
   British Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said earlier that he did not
believe an EEC police force would be established ``in the forseeable
future.''
   ``What will emerge is a greater cooperation between police
forces,'' Hurd said.
   Corcuera admitted there was caution on the part of several
countries about the scope of the service but added agreement on its
importance was a step forward in the fight against new EEC security
problems.
   ``The least important thing is what it might become in the
future,'' he said. ``We have to assure that the elimination of
internal borders is neither good for criminals nor generates greater
insecurity for citizens.''
   Corcuera said the ministers differed over what types of border
controls should exist among EEC countries after Dec. 31, 1992, when
the Single European Act is set to take effect, eliminating barriers
to the movement of capital, goods and labor within the trading bloc.
   Spain advocates the elimination of all controls between EEC
countries while other countries, including Britain, favor border
checks for non-EEC nationals, a move that would effectively leave
the current system intact.
   Problems in a border-free EEC could include increased mobility
for terrorists, transnational currency frauds and the difficulty of
hot pursuit of criminals across national borders, Corcuera said.
   In addition to the intelligence exchange service and internal
borders, Corcuera said the ministers discussed the problems of
defining crimes common to all EEC countries.
   ``These are problems that can affect the legislative domain and
sovereignty of some countries,'' he said, adding that progress was
very difficult.
   Spain holds the six-month rotating presidency of the EEC.

   A high school principal whose
disciplinary methods are the focus of a new movie said his recent
suspension was the work of ``puritanical demagogues.''
   Joe Clark, subject of the recent Warner Bros. Inc. movie ``Lean
on Me,'' said he is not questioning his suspension for arranging an
assembly at his New Jersery school at which four strippers performed.
   ``But for them to get sanctimonious on me. ... They were going to
suspend somebody. So I said, `You want to suspend somebody, suspend
me. I need a rest. I'm tired and you're going to pay me,''' Clark
told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette before speaking at Slippery Rock
University on Thursday evening.
   The suspension was ordered by Paterson's superintendent of
schools, Dr. Frank Napier, according to Robert G. Rosenberg,
attorney for the board of education. The five-day suspension is due
to begin Monday.
   The assembly at Eastside High School included an act by dancer
Wanda Dee in which she stripped four male dancers down to their
G-strings. Clark was not at the school the day of the assembly last
month and has said he never expected the dance group he hired to
lapse into lasciviousness.
   Clark said controversy over his actions has followed him since he
became principal of Eastside in 1982.
   ``I'm seriously thinking about getting out of education,'' Clark
told The Pittsburgh Press.
   Although Clark's speech was applauded often, his remarks drew a
small group of protesters.
   One of the group's leaders, Shawn Williams, a senior at the
University of Pittsburgh, criticized Clark for kicking out hundreds
of students who had poor grades. Williams said that although
Eastside students had achieved higher test scores, ``This
improvement is due to the principal's purging the school of hundreds
of its weakest students.''

<HEAD>Army of Workers Moves to Shattered Basra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BASRA, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein has sent 100,000
workers and heavy equipment to transform this ancient southern port,
shattered by eight years of war, into ``the pearl of the gulf,''
officials report.
   Workers were moved to Basra from other parts of Iraq with 40,000
trucks, mechanical diggers and other heavy machinery after Saddam
visited the city in February and said he wanted reconstruction
completed in three months.
   Iraqis see Basra, founded 1,400 years ago and once called the
Venice of the East, as the symbol of their resistance to repeated
Iranian offensives during the Persian Gulf war. Iranian troops
fought to within six miles of Basra last spring.
   ``We will sweat as much blood as we spilled defending Basra to
make it the pearl of the gulf,'' Gov. Anwar Sa'eed Hadithi said in
an interview Thursday.
   He said the government in Baghdad had ``opened its purse'' to
make funds available in addition to the $5 billion originally
alloted for rebuilding.
   ``The new Basra will be an industrial, trade and tourist center
and will attract more people to work here,'' the governor said.
   Hadithi said more than 3,000 damaged houses would be bulldozed
and their owners given grants of up to $32,000 to build new homes.
   Before the war, Basra was Iraq's second largest city and had a
population of 1.5 million. About half the people fled during the
war, but Hadithi said most had returned since the cease-fire took
effect Aug. 20.
   He said the remnants of some public buildings would be left
standing as monuments, and statues of army commanders killed
defending the city would be erected.
   ``The buildings will stand witness to the savage Iranian shelling
of the city,'' Hadithi said. ``The arms of the statues will point
eastward to warn future generations of Iranian ambitions in our
country.''
   Officials predicted the $500 million international airport,
reopened the day of the truce, would become a major transit point
between Europe and the Far East. The civil aviation authority is
offering cut-price fuel, catering discounts and waived landing fees
as incentives to airlines.
   Last week, the Iraqi Ports Authority began clearing a stretch of
the muddy Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the confluence of the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers, which connects Basra with the gulf and represents
the southern frontier with Iran.
   Whether the border runs in the middle of the Shatt or on the east
bank, which would give Iraq full control, is a major obstacle
U.N.-sponsored peace talks. Iran also is resisting Iraqi demands
that the waterway be cleared of wrecked ships, unexploded bombs and
eight years of silt deposits.
   The Iraqi clearing operations are being carried out north of the
point at which the Shatt, Iraq's only outlet to the sea, becomes the
boundary.
   Officials said at least 10 sunken vessels had been raised in a
nine-mile stretch running south from Maqal, the Basra port.

<HEAD>Tape Fails To Reveal Who Shot U.S. Navy Diver</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tape played in court Friday
covered the tense moments when a U.S. Navy diver was shot aboard a
hijacked TWA jetliner, but no gunfire could be heard in the
static-filled recording.
   The recording was heard as the trial of confessed TWA hijacker
Mohammed Ali Hamadi resumed in a high-security compound at
Frankfurt's Preungesheim prison.
   However, it failed to shed more light on which of the hijackers
shot and killed U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem during the June 1985
hijacking.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air
piracy in the hijacking of TWA Flight 847, during which 39 Americans
were held hostage for 17 days.
   Hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking but has denied
killing Stethem, of Waldorf, Md.
   The airliner was comandeered on a flight from Athens to Rome and
forced to land in Beirut, Lebanon, three times and twice in Algiers,
Algeria.
   The tape covers 49 minutes of conversations between the plane and
the tower during the second landing at Beirut airport on June 15,
when Stethem was shot and tossed onto the tarmac to die.
   When the aircraft landed, one of the hijackers told the control
tower to ``send out a representative of the Amal.''
   The Amal, a Shiite Moslem faction in Lebanon, controlled the
Beirut airport at the time of the hijacking.
   After repeating their demands, one of the hijackers is heard
giving a five-minute deadline, ``or you can take the prettiest
Marine to your hospital.''
   Witnesses have testified that Stethem had been beaten before he
was shot. The hijackers apparently mistook him for a Marine.
   A translator who interpreted the Arab-language segments of the
tape to the court said he could not determine whether Hamadi or his
accomplice was speaking in the tape. Hamadi's accomplice has been
identified in court papers as Hassan Ezzeddine, who is still at
large.
   Hamadi claims his accomplice had talked with the tower and killed
Stethem.
   After a warning from the hijacker that time was running out, the
plane's co-pilot, Philip Maresca, is heard shouting, ``They're
killing a passenger! They're killing a passenger!''
   Stethem's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem, who have
attended the trial regularly since its start July 5, leaned toward
each other in their chairs, anticipating the sound of the shot that
killed their son.
   But no shot could be heard.
   ``Did you hear the noise of the shot?'' one of hijackers is then
heard asking.
   The hijacker warned that a second person would be killed in five
minutes.
   ``One body is already on the runway. If no one is here, there
will be a second,'' the hijacker is heard saying.
   The hijacker later repeats the warning, saying an American will
be killed every five minutes if an Amal representative fails to show
up.
   Witnesses have told the court that about a dozen Amal militiamen
then boarded the plane.
   Hamadi listened closely, interrupting often to correct the
Arab-language translator.
   FBI agent Gary Noesner, who also testified Friday, told the court
that co-pilot Maresca believes Hamadi was the hijacker talking with
the control tower. Maresca has been asked to return March 22 to
testify about the tape.
   The trial was adjourned until Wednesday.

<HEAD>Rooftop Rooters Vow To Fight Planned Private Club Overlooking Wrigley
Field</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: A longer version on sports wire.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rooftop rooters are a tradition among Chicago Cubs
fans, but the team and its neighbors are up in arms over a proposal
for a private club atop a building across from Wrigley Field that
would sell seats for baseball games.
   ``They are clearly stealing our product,'' Cubs President Donald
C. Grenesko said.
   ``We strenuously object to it. If they can do it, then the people
next door can do it, and the people next door to them and the people
next door to them,'' he told the Chicago Sun-Times in an interview
published Friday.
   Grenesko was attending a team owners meeting Friday in Florida
and could not be reached for additional comment, said spokesman Ned
Coletti.
   But Mike Quigley, vice president of a neighborhood group that
battled unsuccesfully to block night baseball at Wrigley Field, said
his group will fight on the team's side this time.
   ``We feel the neighborhood is already past the saturation point
in ability to deal with parking and traffic and liquor-related
problems in association with the ballpark,'' said Quigley, speaking
for Citizens United for Baseball in Sunshine.
   ``The last thing we need is 30 or 40 private clubs just adding to
that,'' he said.
   The neighborhood around Wrigley Field is a close-packed, mostly
residential area on the North Side.
   Unlike the fans who relax in lawn chairs with a beer and a
television set on other rooftops to watch Cubs games, members of the
planned club would pay thousands of dollars for their privilege. The
Cubs' 65 new skyboxes in the stadium already are sold out for this
season at prices ranging from $45,000 to $65,000, the Sun-Times
reported in Friday's editions.
   North Side lawyer Gilbert Liss, a partner in the club project,
declined to comment on it Friday but he told the Sun-Times it would
be private.
   ``They are saying that 50 people, added to the 40,000 who are
already there, are going to cause an undue burden to the
neighborhood,'' Liss said. ``Well, that's ridiculous.
   ``Mr. Grenesko is not pleased. On the other hand. Mr. Grenesko
features the rooftops in (TV) advertising for the Chicago Cubs and
the happy fans.''
   Alderman Bernard J. Hansen, whose ward encompasses Wrigley Field,
said Friday he intends to file an amendment to a zoning ordinance he
has introduced in the City Council to prohibit such a club.
   The amendment would make it illegal for a private club to operate
within 500 feet of an open-air stadium, Hansen said.
   ``They're pirating the use of the Chicago Cubs,'' he said.
   Alderman Helen Shiller, whose ward includes the three-story
building on which construction of the club already has begun, also
opposes it, saying she doubts the project is legal.
   She said work evidently was done on the building without proper
permits.
   ``We started receiving complaints (in January) from neighbors
very upset because construction was going on,'' she told the
Sun-Times.
   Liss told the newspaper the club is allowed under zoning
regulations and ``what we are doing is what's permitted by the law.''
   But Shiller disagreed.
   ``The law, I think, is clear,'' she said. ``In order to exist,
this club needs a zoning change and in order to apply for it they
are going to have to come before the community.''

<HEAD>Soviet Tells Congress About Reduction Steps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has reduced the size of its
Pacific battle fleet by 40 ships since 1984 as a unilateral step to
move Soviet forces to a more defensive posture, a senior Soviet
military analyst told the House Armed Services Committee on Friday.
   The appearance of Andrei A. Kokoshin, deputy director of the
Institute of the USA and Canada, represented only the second time a
representative of the Soviet government has appeared before a
committee of Congress. Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said it was the
first of a series.
   Kokoshin, testifying against the backdrop of massed display of
U.S. military banners topped with clusters of battle streamers, gave
details of other unilateral Soviet military reductions ordered by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, declaring that Moscow would be
gratified if similar reductions were ordered by Western military
forces in return.
   He said the reduction of military forces in Eastern Europe
announced by Gorbachev in a speech before the United Nations General
Assembly last December will be conducted in two phases and will be
completed by the end of next year.
   The Soviet leadership also has determined not to modernize
short-range tactical nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe and will
destroy the existing Soviet stockpile of chemical weapons, Kokoshin
said. He did not say whether the Soviets have stopped production of
such weapons.
   Kokoshin said that in addition to removing 40 ships from the
Pacific fleet between 1984 and 1988, his government has changed the
nature of fleet maneuvers, keeping exercises closer to Soviet shores
``to protect assets on the coastline.''
   A well-placed congressional source said the committee was briefed
by representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency earlier this
week and given information ``not inconsistent'' with the details of
Kokoshin's testimony on Soviet unilateral reductions.
   ``The agency agrees,'' said the source who asked not to be
identified by name.
   Kokoshin said the cuts ordered by Gorbachev in Soviet and Warsaw
Pact forces will be made in two stages.
   This year, he said, two tank divisions and all their equipment
will be pulled out of East Germany.
   In 1990, he added, an additional two tank divisions and assault
landing brigade will be withdrawn.
   Two other tank divisions will be withdrawn, one from
Czechoslovakia and one from Hungary on a time schedule to be
announced, the Soviet witness said.
   Additionally, remaining motor rifle divisions will have 40
percent fewer tanks than at present and remaining tank divisions
will have 20 percent fewer, he said.
   Overall, 10,000 tanks are to be removed _ 5,000 to be crushed and
destroyed and 5,000 to be refitted for training purposes or
converted to civilian purposes, such as removing train wrecks, he
said.
   He said the remaining Soviet units in Eastern Europe will be
provided with additional antitank and short-range antiaircraft
weapons and mining equipment together with ``engineering forces for
defensive purposes.''
   Twenty-four missile launchers also will be removed from East
Germany, he said.
   Kokoshin said senior Soviet military commanders, especially in
the Red Army, initially opposed the reductions but were persuaded by
well-prepared analytical studies.
   ``Military establishments tend to be pretty conservative,'' he
said. ``But they started catching up and they are catching up pretty
quickly.''
   He said the nuclear parity his country has reached with the
United States was a factor in convincing Soviet commanders that
reductions in Western Europe were an acceptable risk.
   With a frankness that would have been highly unlikely in an
earlier era of Soviet history, especially in such a setting,
Kokoshin said excessive military spending drained the Soviet
economy, contributed to a lower living standard than that in the
West and prevented the Kremlin from addressing such pressing issues
as fighting damage to the environment.
   ``We spent excessively,'' he said. ``There is a lot of fat..We
frightened the Western side by doing a little more than we needed.
Now is the time to go in the other direction.''
   Kokoshin said Soviet officials initially regarded former
President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative as an American
attempt to achieve nuclear superiority and waged an excessive
propaganda war against it.
   ``It was less the fault of the specialists than it was of the
propaganda machine, the media people'' he said.
   ``Now we are more confident about our capability to cope with
this threat,'' he said, ticking off a list of countermeasures such
as the massive use of decoys, the deployment of many more missiles
and the use of radio and electronic warfare.
   But he said that even though Soviet officials believe they can
cope with a fully deployed American SDI system, the strategic
balance in such an event would be ``less stable than it is now.''

<HEAD>Bush Nominates Cheney as Defense Secretary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today named House Republican
Whip Richard Cheney of Wyoming as secretary of defense to replace
John Tower, whose nomination was rejected Thursday by the Senate.
   Bush hailed the six-termn congressman as a ``widely respected man
of principle'' who has served the country with distinction.
   Cheney, 48, was chief of the White House staff during the
administration of President Ford, and has served in the House since
1978. He is the No. 2 Republican in the chamber.
   Tower was an acknowledged expert in defense matters. Cheney, by
contrast, said he was versant in many important areas, but had much
to learn. ``Obviously there are areas I'll have to work hard to
master, but I feel I have a depth of understanding now.''
   Bush made no direct reference to the Tower saga, which ended on
the Senate floor 24 hours before today's announcement, as he
presented his choice. But he said, ``Look, that's history'' when
asked later about it.
   ``As of today, Dick Cheney is the best and proper choice'' to
head the Pentagon, the president said.
   Cheney made a reference of his own to Tower's defeast.
   ``Obviously things have moved very quickly in the last 24
hours,'' Cheney said in referring to Bush's swift, overnight search
for a replacement candidate.
   Cheney said he underwent heart bypass surgery last August, but
returned to work three weeks later. He also sustained a mild heart
attack in 1978.
   He said he had checked with his doctor before accepting Bush's
offer of the appointment, and was assured his health posed no
barrier.
   Bush thus moved to put the Tower defat behind him swiftly.
   The Tower vote was a major defeat for the new Republican
president and left bitterness in its wake.
   ``Never in all my years in the Senate have I encountered anything
like the feeling of outrage that exists today among my former
Republican Senate colleagues,'' Vice President Dan Quayle said in a
speech today in Indianapolis. ``Never have I encountered such anger
and bitterness in the Senate chamber.''
   Quayle accused Tower's critics of engaging in ``a McCarthyite
mud-slinging campaign'' that he said had ``degraded the Senate.''
   The naming of a new candidate for defense secretary gains added
urgency in light of evidence the Pentagon is close to bureaucratic
paralysis because of the time lost in the bruising battle over Tower.
   Decisions need to be made across the Pentagon, including the
staffing of key positions, Bush's plan to cut almost $6.4 billion
from the Pentagon budget, and on a special 90-day strategic military
policy review the president has set in motion.
   In a statement he read minutes after the Senate vote, Tower said:
``I will be recorded as the first Cabinet nominee in the history of
the republic to be rejected in the first 90 days of a presidency and
perhaps be harshly judged.
   ``But I depart from this place at peace with myself, knowing that
I have given a full measure of devotion to my country,'' he
continued. ``No public figure in my memory has been subjected to
such a far-reaching and thorough investigation nor had his human
foibles bared to such intensive and demeaning public scrutiny.''
   In the Senate, Democratic leaders turned to damage control to
limit the impact of Tower's rejection on the bipartisan spirit that
seemed about to bloom in the days immediately after Bush's
inauguration.
   But many Republicans said the bitterness would linger.
   Dole had much to say, condemning a confirmation process he said
had become a ``hotbed of character assassination'' and ``a pitched
partisan battle.''
   ``The partisan taste of this debate is going to linger,'' said
Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis. ``This is going to make it damn tough for
us to act in much of a bipartisan manner in the months ahead.''
   ``Bipartisanship is not going to be automatically restored unless
the majority wants it restored,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine voiced the
optimistic view of many senior Democrats when he said: ``There will
be no long-term adverse effects within the Senate.''
   ``We must work together in the future because the national
interest compels us to do so,'' he said. ``I know it is difficult
now in the heat and anger of the moment, but that is precisely what
I ask of my colleagues.''
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., who said he feared the scrap over
Tower might mark ``the first battle in an all-out war between
Congress and the president,'' said he had been reassured by
Mitchell's words.
   ``But words are cheap, and the continuing effect of the vote
remains to be seen,'' he said.
   Some Republicans disagreed with their angry GOP colleagues.
   ``I feel a spirit of reconciliation already coming over the
Senate,'' said Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the ranking GOP member
of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Quayle, who had stood ready to break a tie in Tower's favor as
the vote was taken, was also more conciliatory than many Republicans.
   ``We have a job ahead of us,'' Quayle said. ``We have an agenda
ahead of us. And we're going to need the help and cooperation of the
Democratic Congress. ''
   Many Democrats echoed Mitchell's attempts to get the
congressional train back on track.
   ``The importance of this vote has been exaggerated out of all
proportion,'' said Sen. David Boren, D-Okla. ``It is important that
we now put the Tower controversy behind us and get back to work.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., added, ``This was one vote on one
person on one job under one set of circumstances.''
   The Senate's most senior Democrat, Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia, said he believes the Senate fulfilled its role under the
Constitution ``to refuse to be a rubber stamp for any president, new
or otherwise.''
   ``These things come and go like storms which sweep out to sea,
and then the sun comes out again,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Troop Cuts Planned in Country's Northwest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets have said their planned military cuts
include the reduction of up to 20,000 troops based in the Leningrad
military district, which includes the Kola Peninsula, Norway's
ambassador said Friday.
   Ambassador Olav Buchert-Johannessen said Soviet Defense Ministry
officials disclosed the plans in a meeting with a Norwegian
parliamentary delegation visiting Moscow. The cuts are part of a
500,000-man cut in Soviet armed forces announced by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in December.
   Buchert-Johannessen said the Norwegian officials were told ``up
to 20,000'' troops, would be cut in the Leningrad military district,
which equals 15 percent to 20 percent of the forces.
   ``Such a unilateral step as this we consider very positive,''
Buchert-Johannessen said. Norway is a U.S. ally and member of the
North Atlantci Treaty Organization.
   The Leningrad military district is part of what the Soviets refer
to as the Northwestern Theater of Military Operations.
   The Pentagon's 1988 assessment of Soviet military might says the
Soviets have 12 divisions, 1,350 tanks, 3,750 armored personnel
carriers and infantry fighting vehicles, 2,100 artillery units, 90
tactical submarines, and 160 tactical aircraft in the northwestern
theater.
   Buchert-Johannessen said the Soviet military officials told the
Norwegian lawmakers that they were still considering exactly how
many troops will be cut, and from which divisions.
   Gorbachev has said his country will cut its armed forces by a
half million men over the next two years _ 240,000 of them from the
European theater.

<HEAD>B-2 Flight Delayed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The B-2 stealth bomber, unveiled last fall
after more than a decade of secret work, will not fly for the first
time before late spring or summer, the Air Force said Friday.
   Acknowledging recent reports that the schedule for the first
flight was in jeopardy, the service said that because of ``an
aggregation of minor system checkout problems, the B-2's first
flight is now expected to be in the late spring or early summer time
frame.''
   ``Routine systems checkout of the first B-2 Advanced Technology
Bomber is continuing ...,'' the Air Force added. ``After first
flight, the B-2 will undergo extensive testing at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif.''
   When the Air Force made its first announcement last summer about
an unveiling for the unusual ``flying wing'' plane, it confidently
predicted the aircraft would be ready for its first flight in the
fall of 1988.
   The plane was ultimately shown to the public for the first time
Nov. 22 at an Air Force plant in Palmdale, Calif.
   Air Force and Pentagon officials said at the time they were not
going to rush the initial checkouts of the sophisticated flight
systems, but that they still expected the plane to fly before the
end of the year.
   Maj. Pat Mullaney, an Air Force spokesman, said Friday the
problems encountered by technicians all had been relatively minor,
but that it took time to prepare a plane for its first flight.
   ``We have said all along that we're going to fly this airplane
when it's ready, and not according to some calendar schedule,'' said
Mullaney.
   The spokesman added the Air Force decided to release Friday's
statement after encountering a problem with the bomber's
``environmental control,'' or air conditioning, system, within the
past week or so.
   A component of that system failed during a high-pressure test,
Mullaney said. Even though the system was purposely overloaded 50
percent beyond its design limit at the time, the Air Force decided
to fix the component to ensure an extra margin of safety.
   ``The fix for that is straightforward and corrective action is
underway,'' he said.
   The disclosure of checkout problems comes three months after the
Air Force announced the B-2 would carry a price tag _ including
research and development costs _ of $516 million per plane. That
will make it the most expensive airplane ever.
   According to the latest Air Force estimate, the design,
development and construction of 132 planes will cost $68.1 billion
by the time production ends in mid-1995. Even if research and
development expenses are excluded, each plane still will cost $305
million to produce on the assembly line.
   The B-2, built primarily by Northrop Corp., resembles a huge,
tailless manta ray, with wide sweeping wings blending smoothly into
rounded cockpit and engine housings on the top side.
   The stealth gets its name from the claim that it will be almost
invisible to enemy radar, due to the extensive use of exotic
composite materials, some of which absorb rather than reflect radar
waves; its lack of sharp surface angles; and a cross-section that
offers a very small profile to radar.
   The plane is a ``flying wing,'' a design resurrected from the
1940s that steers with flaps on the rear of the wings rather than
with a tail. The B-2 is described as an all-altitude penetration
bomber, as opposed to the B-1 bomber, which is designed to penetrate
enemy air defenses at low altitudes.
   The Air Force says the plane is 69 feet long, about the length of
an F-16 fighter plane. Its wingspan, at 172 feet, is almost as wide
as the aging B-52.

   The bomb Beahan released was the last atom bomb dropped on human
beings, and in 1985, the 40th anniversay of the bombing, he said he
hoped to retain that dubious distinction.
   He said he would never apologize for his deed that was followed
by the Japanese surrender, adding that 25 Japanese sought him out a
few years ago and told him the bombing was the ``best way out of a
hell of a mess.''
   Beahan became a bombardier in the Army Air Corps after washing
out as a pilot candidate.
   He took part in 40 missions over Europe, including the first B-17
raids. His B-17 unit was commanded by Paul W. Tibbets, who later
assembled the team that dropped two atom bombs on Japan.
   In addition to dropping the second atomic bomb, Beahan was aboard
a plane that escorted the Enola Gay, Tibbets' plane that dropped the
first bomb, on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945.
   Beahan recalled the Nagasaki bombing in an interview with the
Houston Chronicle.
   ``I saw a mushroom cloud bubbling and flashing orange, red and
green,'' he said. ``It looked like a picture of hell. The ground
itself was covered by a rolling black smoke. I was told the area
would be destroyed, but I didn't know the meaning of an atomic
bomb.''
   Beahan retired from the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel in 1963
and worked for Brown &amp; Root Inc., a Houston-based engineering and
construction firm, as a technical writer until he retired in 1985.
   Survivors include his wife, Teresa, a daughter, two sons and a
brother.
   Graveside services were scheduled for Monday.

   President Bush said Friday he will nominate
undersecretary of state Michael Armacost to be ambassador to Japan,
succeeding Mike Mansfield.
   Armacost's selection had been known for weeks but not formally
announced by the White House. Since 1984, Armacost has been the
State Department's undersecretary for political affairs, following a
two-year stint as ambassador to the Philippines.
   From 1980 until 1981, Armacost served as principal deputy

   Dr. Louis Sullivan on Friday enthusiastically
welcomed the challenge of his friend, President Bush, to make
America a ``kinder, gentler nation'' and pledged to use ``a gentle
touch'' in running the Department of Health and Human Services.
   At his formal swearing-in ceremony, Sullivan said his goals will
include finding better ways to serve the poor, continuing the search
for an AIDS cure, helping to rid the nation of drug abuse and
containing soaring health care costs.
   ``During my tenure, the offices of the department will have a
human face, the regulations will carry a gentle touch,'' the new
secretary said after taking the oath of office in a ceremony
attended by Bush and his wife, Barbara.
   Sullivan is a personal friend of the Bushes. Mrs. Bush serves on
the board of trustees of the Morehouse School of Medicine in
Atlanta, which Sullivan, a blood specialist, founded and served as
president.
   Bush said Sullivan has his ``complete confidence and my full
support'' at HHS, whose nearly $400 billion budget is largest of all
federal departments.
   Reflecting on Sullivan's goal at Morehouse to train minority
physicians to work in medically underserved urban and rural areas,
Bush said, ``What sets Lou Sullivan apart is that something extra he
brings to his work, a sense of mission.''
   Though Bush and Sullivan have agree on the major issues
confronting the department, they appear to have different positions
on programs that offer drug addicts clean needles to help stop the
spread of the AIDS virus.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman, said Bush is
``opposed to exchangeable needles under any condition.''
   Sullivan has told reporters he does not believe clean needle
programs condone drug abuse and he supports needle exchanges in
communities that want them. He said the federal government could
provide assistance to local communities in setting up such
facilities to see if such programs work in helping stop the spread
of the deadly virus.
   Sullivan was confirmed by the Senate last week and was officially
sworn in the same day. The ceremony on Friday was a formal
swearing-in attended by a several hundred department employees,
administration officials and a few members of Congress.
   Sullivan was joined on the podium by his wife, Ginger, and two
sons and daughter. His son, Halsted, a senior at the University of
Virginia, sang ``The Star Spangled Banner.''

<HEAD>Falwell Asks Employees Who Don't Start Tithing By July To Quit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell told the 2,000
employees of his religious empire Friday that they are expected to
join his church and donate 10 percent of their salaries to it.
   ``If this is something you in your heart can't do, it would be
better for you to not be a member of this team, rather than be
forced to serve God here,'' Falwell told employees of Liberty
University, Old-Time Gospel Hour, Lynchburg Christian Academy,
Liberty Godparent Home, Liberty Broadcasting Network and Thomas Road
Baptist Church.
   About 400 of the workers are employed by Liberty University and
Liberty Christian Academy, where they sign contracts calling for
church membership and tithing, Falwell spokesman Mark DeMoss said.
Other workers have for years been expected to comply by the rules of
a policy book that also calls for church attendance and tithing, he
said.
   Falwell asked employees who do not comply by the rules to quit by
July 1, but DeMoss said the ministry will trust workers to comply on
their own.
   ``We're not talking about Gestapo methods,'' said Falwell. ``But
we cannot move ahead without getting our camps together. ... I felt
the need to once again verbalize the vision.''
   Some workers will be exempted from the requirements, DeMoss said.
Exempted workers would include, for example, teachers who are
pastors of their own churches or long-time Lynchburg residents who
have been members of other churches, the spokesman said.
   Workers leaving the 45-minute meeting at Thomas Road Baptist
Church were divided in their opinions on Falwell's stand.
   Old-Time Gospel Hour employee Dana Williams told WSET-TV she
would quit. ``This is morally and spiritually wrong. I'm just as
good of a Christian as anyone here, and I tithe to my regular
church.''
   Thomas Road Baptist Church employee Glenn Reese countered, ``I
think Jerry Falwell was only re-emphasizing his vision and the
vision of the Bible in bringing church workers together.''
   The ministry's payroll is $35 million, and if each worker paid 10
percent, that would equal the Thomas Road church's annual budget of
$3.5 million, Falwell said.
   DeMoss said there was no significance to the timing of Falwell's
meeting, which came shortly Falwell firmed up plans for a $30
million, 10,000-seat church to be built near the Liberty University
campus by 1991.
   ``When our fiscal year ends on June 30, the total revenue will
exceed last year's receipts by nearly $40 million, for a total of
about $129 million, compared with under $88 million a year ago,''
DeMoss said.
   Falwell's meeting with the local employees also was part of his
long-term plan to get out of the national spotlight and concentrate
more on his local ministry, DeMoss said. After Falwell assumed
control of PTL and then left it a short time later in 1987, he said
he would try to spend more time working as a local preacher.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commission appointed by President Bush to
study government ethics Friday proposed banning all honoraria and
limiting income that lawmakers and senior officials earn outside
their jobs.
   Malcolm R. Wilkey, chairman of the Commission on Federal Ethics
Law Reform, urged President Bush to incorporate as many of the
panel's recommendations as possible into an executive order that
would apply to senior government officials.
   ``Laws alone, of course, won't do the job. What is needed is a
spirit of ethics and morality in the government,'' said Wilkey, a
former federal appellate judge who has served since 1985 as U.S.
ambassador to Uruguay.
   ``There must be a will to form, maintain and operate an ethical
government. That leadership must come from the top in each branch,''
Wilkey added.
   ``The president, the Cabinet officers, the heads of independent
agencies,'' Wilkey said, ``must emphasize ethics and lead by
example.''
   The eight-member commission issued a 150-page report detailing 27
recommendations for changes in ethics laws and regulations as they
apply to senior government officials, members of Congress and their
staffs, as well as judges.
   The commission, which adopted its findings in public sessions
over the last month, recommended:
   _ An outright ban on fees that government officials, lawmakers
and judges are paid to give speeches.
   _ Limiting the outside income an official could earn, but not
setting amy specific percentage. The commission recommended the
limit be toward the lower end of a range between the 15 percent cap
that now applies to executive branch employees and the 40 percent
limit on the income of U.S. senators.
   The president would have the right to exempt certain types of
income, such as royalties for writing books or any activity that
doesn't conflict with government service.
   _ Giving people entering government a chance to defer paying the
capital gains tax on stock divestitures made to avoid conflicts of
interest before assuming office.
   _ Extending the law that bars officials from taking action that
conflicts with their financial interest to judges and congressional
staffers, but not lawmakers.
   _ Putting lawmakers and judges under the same one-year ban that
now prohibits former senior government officials from contacting
their former agency about particular issues they were involved in.
   _ That the Congress create a two-year bar on former officials
disclosing certain proprietary or strategic information gained
during government service to private clients. This would include
strategy on international trade and arms negotiations as well as
certain financial data.
   _ Change the reporting rules to require that officials disclose
all assets worth more than $1 million and income of more than
$250,000 a year. Wilkey these changes in categories would be more
meaningful. The report also will require officials to disclose
mortgages and private debts to relatives.
   ``We feel that debts and liabilities pose more danger of
influencing the employee than small amounts of stock,'' Wilkey said.
   The recommendations were immediately criticized in a statement by
Fred Wertheimer, the president of Common Cause. ``The Ethics
Commission's principal failure comes with regard to the executive
branch where its recommendations for the most part represent a
combination of preserving the status quo, backtracking on existing
requirements, or ducking.''
   Former Attorney General Griffin Bell, the panel's vice chairman
disagreed, saying: ``I think it's very tough. The test of it will be
how much of it is adopted.''
   Other members of the panel were Jan Baron, Judith H. Bellow,
Lloyd Cutler, Fred Fielding, former Sen. Harrison Schmitt, D-N.M.
and R. James Woolsey.

   Parisians had to rely on television and radio for
news Thursday as a strike by newspaper delivery workers entered its
second day.
   The strike by workers of the Nouvelles Messageries de la Presse
Parisienne, the nation's sole newspaper distribution company,
paralyzed delivery of morning newspapers in the capital and other
French cities.
   Many of the capital's colorful kiosks remained shut and bore
signs reading, ``Newspapers not delivered.''
   A few newspapers, including the Communist-daily L'Humanite and
the afternoon daily Le Monde, managed to distribute a few thousand
copies.
   The strike also affected delivery of some news magazines,
including Paris-Match, L'Express, Le Nouvel Observateur and others.
   The 2,600 workers, members of the Communist-led Confederation de
Travaille, are demanding job security as they face modernization in
the printing and distribution of newspapers.

<HEAD>Outdated Law Costing U.S. Millions in Land Deals: GAO</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government is losing millions of dollars on
federal land sales because it hasn't modernized a 115-year-old law
that allows real estate speculators to buy federal property at less
than bargain-basement rates, says a new General Accounting Office
report.
   Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., said loopholes in the Mining Law of
1872 have enabled developers to purchase federal land near gambling
casinos and ski resorts at ``fire sale prices.''
   Rahall, chairman of the House subcommittee on mining, said he
plans to offer legislation to modernize the law so that it will do
what it is supposed to do _ promote mineral exploration.
   The GAO report, released this week and requested by Rahall, shows
that the government received less that $4,500 for land estimated to
be worth up to $48 million.
   The report also said the GAO reviewed 12 pending applications for
public land appraised at about $47 million that would be sold for
only $16,000.
   ``The intent of the mining law is to facilitate mineral
extraction, not to serve as a vehicle for land speculation and
profiteering at the public's expense,'' said Rahall.
   Under the law, enacted when Ulysses S. Grant was president,
claims to valuable deposits of minerals such as gold and silver on
public lands could be ``patented'' for $2.50 an acre.
   The patent transfers title to the land from the federal
government to the private claim holder. About 3.2 million acres of
public land have been sold in this way, the GAO report said.
   Land covered by the act and near resort areas, expanding
communities, and tourist attractions has been particularly
attractive to developers who have no plans for mining.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Wednesday he believes the
law should be changed to bring the prices for the land into line
with modern times. He said that as long as the law mandates $2.50 an
acre, that's what the Interior Department must use as the cost.
   ``These federal lands are owned by all of the people and should
be held as a public trust,'' said Rahall. ``We are being done a
grave injustice by these give-aways and this law must be changed.''
   Land covered by the mining law is in 12 states: Montana, Wyoming,
Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Washington,
Oregon, California and Alaska.
   The GAO gave several examples of valuable land going for cheap
prices.
   A 160-acre claim near the Keystone, Colo., ski resort that was
sold for $400 by the government in 1983 under the mining act was
never mined. The buyer offered 44 acres of the claim for sale last
year at $484,000.
   An application was filed in 1987 for 1,280 acres near Lake Mead,
within three miles of nine gambling casinos in Laughlin, Nev. If
patented at the $2.50 an acre rate, the land will produce $3,200 for
the government while, according to a local real estate agent,
private interests could get between $25.6 million and $32 million.

   A senior Vatican theologian condemned divorce
and contraceptive practices in the United States in a speech Friday
that targeted Planned Parenthood, feminism and the entertainment
industry, especially the TV series ``Dallas.''
   Cardinal Eduard Gagnon, president of the Pontifical Council for
the Family, told U.S. Roman Catholic bishops it was crucial that
Americans follow church teaching on sexuality, since they influenced
Europe and the developing world.
   During the meeting with the U.S. Catholic hierarchy, Italian
Cardinal Achille Silvestrini also criticized U.S. marriage
tribunals, saying their methods apparently were ``not fully in
conformity'' with church law.
   The Vatican officials spoke on the third day of an extraordinary
four-day meeting called by Pope John Paul II to discuss the 52
million American Catholics, one of his largest, wealthiest and most
powerful flocks.
   Friday's discussion reflected concern in the Vatican about the
many U.S. Catholics who dissent from church teachings on birth
control, divorce and other issues.
   Gagnon told the 35 American prelates gathered in the underground
stone Old Synod Hall that the Vatican also was concerned about
homosexuality, the use of sterilization by American Catholicsm and
feminism, which he said ``has a deleterious influence on the
family.''
   He said theologians were increasingly recognizing ``the social
and moral disaster a contraceptive mentality can lead to.''
   A particular challenge, he said, was presented by Planned
Parenthood's efforts to set up school-based birth control clinics.
   ``Planned Parenthood programs of sex education in no way resolve
the problem of teen-age pregnancies, but rather increase it by
encouraging promiscuity,'' he declared.
   He also accused the organization of trying to undermine Catholic
teaching that the only permissible birth control method is ``natural
family planning,'' in which a couple abstains from sex during the
woman's fertile period.
   In Chicago, the acting president of the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, David J. Andrews, said Gagnon ``is absolutely
right'' in suggesting that the group opposes the church's position
on birth control.
   Andrews said Gagnon's speech reflects ``the desperation of a
church trying to come to grips with the issue of sexuality and with
the fact that people the world over rely on effective methods of
birth control and want to keep abortion services safe and legal.''
   Archbishop John Quinn of San Francisco made no mention of
artificial birth control in a companion speech to the family.
   But talking to journalists later, Cardinal John O'Connor of New
York said ``it is time for us to teach all over again'' the church's
position on contraception. ``I find Catholics sick of
contraception.''
   An estimated 70 percent of American Catholics use artificial
birth control, and U.S. Catholic bishops suggested in a draft
pastoral letter in April that the church should be more responsive
toward them.
   The Rev. John Lynch, secretary of the U.S. National Conference of
Bishops, said no U.S. bishop criticized Vatican policies during
discussions Friday.
   He said several of them noted ``a high level of acceptance of
Catholic social teaching but not the same level for the church's
moral teachings.''
   Gagnon also urged the bishops to increase their vigilance over
Catholic marriage tribunals and said some forms of U.S. ministry to
divorced Catholics had ``degenerated into dating services.''
   He warned too many annulments could support ``the prevalent
divorce mentality'' that conflicted with Catholic belief in lifelong
commitment.
   Speaking after Gagnon, Silvestrini said that of 45,632 annulments
granted worldwide in 1985, 36,180 were in the United States.
   Several U.S. bishops defended their tribunals as careful and
hard-working. Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles also said that
Vatican statistics did not include the many annulment cases which
courts refused to hear.
   He said that in his diocese last year, the courts accepted 1,000
cases but refused to consider 13,000.
   Gagnon told the U.S. prelates that Catholics around the world
looked to their leadership in the fight against abortion and the
spread of pornography.
   Specifically, he said the bishops should do something about
``more subtle pornography, that is the degrading of moral values
vehicled by cinema and TV shows which pretend to depict normal
American life.''
   Singling out the TV series ``Dallas,'' _ known for its potrayal
of adultery, greed and cruelty _ Gagnon said bishops in other
countries ``would like us to reflect on what we export can do to the
conscience of their people.''

   The global warming trend known as the
greenhouse effect is not yet a confirmed scientific fact, but U.S.
energy policy ought to proceed as if it is, an Energy Department
official said Friday.
   ``I don't think we ought to get bogged down too much right now in
a public discussion of scientific aspects of the greenhouse
effect,'' said Donna Fitzpatrick, undersecretary of energy. ``It
seems to me there is plenty of room for public money and public
energy to put into things we should be doing anyway.''
   Ms. Fitzpatrick appeared on a panel on environmental problems at
a convention sponsored by the Consumer Federation of America. She
argued, ``There is no undisputed and settled consensus in the
scientific community about whether the greenhouse effect is
occuring,'' which she called ``an open question.''
   The greenhouse effect is the predicted warming of the earth by
increasing amounts of heat trapped by man-made gases, like carbon
dioxide, which are produced by the burning of fossil fuels.
   Scientists generally agree the earth has warmed about 0.9 degrees
Fahrenheit over the last century, which most of them attribute to
the buildup of these gases.
   Ms. Fitzpatrick said the temperature buildup ``doesn't match what
we should have seen because of the greenhouse effect,'' since there
was a pronounced cooling trend in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.
   In any case, she sketched some policy priorities which she said
the most fervent environmentalists and believers in the greenhouse
effect could agree with: ``energy efficiency, switching to
technologies which don't require the use of fossil fuels such as
renewable technologies which are now just beginning to have the
reliability and economy we need,'' and one that environmentalists
generally oppose, improved nuclear power.
   ``We need to do these things anyway. We should do them. We should
not be wasting energy, being inefficient in its use, even if we
didn't think we have a greenhouse effect, and because use of fossil
fuels has other environmental hazards besides the greenhouse
effect,'' she said.
   Among those hazards, which she did not spell out, can be the
pollutants that form acid rain.
   Her companion on the panel was James MacKenzie, a researcher at
the World Resources Institute, an environmental policy research
organization that has argued vigorously that the greenhouse effect
is in progress.
   ``According to the National Academy of Sciences, which reported
to President Bush as soon as he took over, the greenhouse effect is
the best-understood problem in atmospheric science,'' MacKenzie said.
   ``The uncertainties are timing and the impact of when these
effects are going to happen. There is no uncertainty these gases are
building up in the atmosphere and that they trap radiative heat.''
   MacKenzie endorsed an efficiency-first strategy.
   ``The fact is, the most readily available source now is
efficiency, which we could tap in our buildings. We are not doing
that,'' he said.
   ``There are several major studies being completed which show
electricity growth could be held to zero for several decades through
the use of more efficent lighting and motors, at far less than the
cost of producing new power plants. The problem is in our
institutions; it's not in our technology. The stuff is available,''
he said.
   Academy panels have predicted an average warming of three to
eight degrees sometime in the middle of the next century. Some
computer models say this warming could occur as early as 2030;
others say as late as 2080.
   Ms. Fitzpatrick was assistant secretary for conservation and
renewable energy sources before last August, when she became
undersecretary, the No. 3 position in the department.

<HEAD>Cheney Answers Call of White House Under Stress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once again the White House summoned at a moment
of stress, and once again Dick Cheney answered the call.
   First it was President Ford, who needed all the help he could get
to manage his ``accidental presidency.'' He brought the soft-spoken,
scholarly but aggressive Cheney to his side as White House chief of
staff in 1974.
   On Friday it was President Bush's turn. Burned by the Senate's
rejection of John G. Tower as defense secretary, Bush summoned
Cheney as his nominee to head the Pentagon.
   In picking the six-term congressman, Bush selected someone with a
reputation as a Republican with a future _ someone, it was said, who
was bound if he stayed in the House eventually to become the House
Republican leader and, if the GOP gained control, to become speaker.
   Cheney, 48, served Ford first as a deputy assistant, than as
chief of staff. He went back to his native Wyoming after Ford
narrowly lost his bid for a full term in the presidency. He ran for
Congress in 1978 against a tough Republican challenger in the
primary and easily won election as the state's congressman at large.
He has been re-elected ever since by healthy margins.
   Cheney suffered a mild heart attack in that first race for the
House. Last August, he underwent heart bypass surgery.
   The first question put to Cheney when Bush introduced him Friday
as his nominee was whether his health was up to the strain of
running the huge Pentagon bureaucracy. He said it was.
   He said he had been back at work three weeks after the bypass
operation and that he had skiied at Vail, Colo. last Christmas. He
said he checked with his cardiologist before accepting Bush's offer,
and his doctor said there was no medical reason why he couldn't take
the job.
   Bush praised Cheney as someone who had struggled with a budget,
become familiar with defense issues as a member of the House
Intelligence Committee, knew the topics of arms control, strategic
defense policy choices, Central American policy.
   ``He's a thoughtful man, a quiet man, a strong man,'' said Bush.
   Cheney said he was delighted. He said Secretary of State James
Baker III and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser,
were old friends.
   ``I am glad to be part of the team and eager to get to work,'' he
said.
   Cheney was born in Lincoln, Neb., and attended elementary and
high school in Casper, Wyo. He went to Yale _ Bush's alma mater _
got a master's degree at the University of Wyoming and worked on a
Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin.
   His first Washington experience was as a congressional fellow, 20
years ago. He worked in the Office of Economic Opportunity, the
anti-poverty agency of the Nixon years, and as a staff assistant in
the Nixon White House in 1971, and as assistant director of the Cost
of Living Council in 1971-73. It was the agency President Nixon
created to battle inflation.
   He and his wife, Lynne, wrote a book, ``Kings of the Hill,'' a
study of past speakers of the House. She served as chairman of the
National Endowment for the Humanities in the Reagan Administration
and was a well-known figure in Washington _ perhaps even better
known that her husband. For a time, she was an editor of
Washingtonian magazine.
   In the House, Cheney fought for aid for the Nicaraguan Contras
and fought on the floor against one of the most powerful Democrats _
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee _ to
make a tax revision bill closer to Ronald Reagan's designs than
Rostenkowski would have preferred.

   President Bush will name Edward Ney, a New York
advertising executive, as ambassador to Canada, an administration
source said Friday.
   No formal announcement has been made on the post, but the
president has decided on Ney, said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Ney, 63, is chairman of Paine Webber-Young and Rubicam Ventures,
a marketing-consulting firm.
   He will replace Ambassador Thomas Niles in the Ottawa post.
   Ney served as an informal adviser on advertising to the Bush
campaign.
   In 1984, Ney expressed dismay with the tenor of political
advertising and pledged $25,000 to study ways of improving the
American electoral process. The money was to fund a task force on
TV-political reform.
   He told the New York Times he was appalled by the ``waste of
time, talent and money'' in excessive political TV ads.

<HEAD>EC Urges U.S. to Adopt European Standard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community Commission on Friday
urged the United States to adopt the European production standard
for high-definition television, saying the EC's approach would be
better for consumers and the TV industry than a competing U.S.
proposal.
   The commission's Washington delegation sent a letter outlining
the EC's approach and criteria for a worldwide HDTV production
standard to the State and Commerce departments.
   The commission said the European standard ``has been shown to be
feasible and the best for producers, broadcasters, the TV industry
and the consumer. In this regard, the commission seeks the support
and cooperation of the United States government.''
   The Europeans are proposing that the next generation of
television _ which promises wall-sized TV screens with the clarity
of 35 mm film _ use a world production standard of 1,250
sequentially scanned lines and 50 frames per second. The United
States in 1984 proposed a 1,125 line-60 frame standard, and since
that time has received the backing of Japan, Canada and Mexico.
   The stakes are high for the United States, which fears that
multiple standards would jeopardize overseas sales of U.S. movies
and TV programs.
   A Commerce Department official said the department thinks the
1,125 line-60 frame standard ``should in fact be reviewed.''
   Jim Spurlock, spokesman for the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration, noted that his agency recently asked the
film and television industry to comment on the U.S. standard.

   Gusty wind delayed some work, but the
countdown progressed on time Friday toward a Monday launch of the
first of seven space shuttle missions planned this year.
   While winds up to 30 mph were pesky, NASA test director Frank
Merlino said they were abating and that the weather forecast was
``looking good'' for launch day for space shuttle Discovery and its
crew of five.
   The countdown began at 12:01 a.m. Friday. Several hours later,
Merlino reported that most systems checks were running on or ahead
of schedule. The winds delayed the sealing of the engine compartment
and removal of some work platforms, but he said that would not
interrupt the countdown.
   Liftoff is scheduled at 8:07 a.m. EST Monday for the 28th space
shuttle flight and the third since the Challenger explosion killed
seven astronauts more than three years ago.
   Discovery returned Americans to space last September, while
shuttle Atlantis flew in December.
   Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats, the astronaut who will command next
week's flight, said it will kick off an ``ambitious year'' as NASA
moves toward its goal of safe, routine once-a-month launches by 1992.
   Coats and his four crew members flew here Friday afternoon from
their training base in House to make final preparations for launch.
   Talking with commanders on arriving, Coats noted his crew had
been assigned to a flight four years ago, one that was to have been
launched in 1986, only to have the Challenger accident interrupt
plans.
   ``We've had a lot of ups and downs and a lot of frustrations over
those years,'' he said. ``But this crew has held up incredibly well.
... We're certainly ready to go.''
   The others are Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, the pilot; and three
mission specialists, Marine Cols. James F. Buchli and Robert C.
Springer and Dr. James M. Bagian, a physician.
   During five days in orbit, they are to release a $100 million
Tracking and Data Relay communications satellite and conduct
numerous medical and scientific experiments.
   In a recent interview, Coats said the first two post-Challenger
missions ``were important to show that we could fly the space
shuttle again after the catastrophe.''
   ``The next step,'' he said, ``is to prove that we can do it on a
regular basis, that we're back in the business of space, to show
we're a space-faring nation again.''

<HEAD>Sugar Outlook: Production Record, Consumption Even Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outlook for world sugar production in
1988-89 has been revised downward slightly to 106.4 million metric
tons, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Although down about 0.5 percent from a forecast of 106.9 million
tons in December, production still would be at a record level.
   Total consumption in 1988-89 was forecast at 107.5 million tons,
up slightly from December, the report said. With use exceeding
production, global stocks are expected to decline for the fourth
year in a row.
   ``Stocks at the end of the 1988-89 season may be less than 20
percent of consumption, down from the peak of 31 percent in 1982-83
and the lowest since 1980-81,'' the report said.
   Reduced sugar stockpiles ``suggest strong prices'' in the coming
year, but the report said much depends on 1989-90 world sugar
prospects and decisions about imports.
   In the U.S. market, prices for raw sugar delivered to New York
averaged 22.13 cents per pound in 1988, compared with 21.83 cents in
1987, the report said. Prices in February averaged 22.07 cents per
pound.
   Retail prices for refined sugar have risen faster, averaging
25.49 cents per pound in the Midwest last year, compared with 23.6
cents in 1987, the report said. In February, those averaged nearly
29 cents, up from 22.75 a year ago.
   Nationally, U.S. retail sugar prices averaged 36.6 cents per
pound in 1988, up 4 percent from 1987, the report said. Retail sugar
prices averaged 35.4 cents per pound from 1982 through 1987.

<HEAD>Study Says Asylum Screening Procedures Could Be Improved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal procedures to screen petitions for
political asylum may be inadequate in addressing non-frivolous
claims filed by Central American refugees in South Texas, according
to a Senate study.
   The study also recommended more asylum petitions be granted and
procedures be developed to help those truly deserving refugee status
make their case, as some worthy applicants, it said, are going
underground because of the risks of detention and deportation.
   Senate staff members who visited the Rio Grande Valley in
February, after the Immigration and Naturalization Service began
detaining refugee-seekers while their asylum cases were pending,
said most applications appear frivolous.
   The study mission said the INS procedures in general are
adequate. But it was not convinced the small percentage of
borderline cases, known as ``intent to deny'' applicants because
they must provide additional information or risk denial, was given
adequate opportunity to present a claim.
   ``One important question, not answered to the delegation's
satisfaction, is whether these `intent to deny' applicants are
informed of the specific areas of weakness or incompleteness in
their cases,'' the study said.
   The study suggested strenthening procedures for the borderline
cases, such as outlining the reasons denial was being considered for
applicants so they could then ``more meaningfully rebut their case
in the two-week period currently allowed.''
   Some of the ``intent to deny'' cases reviewed by the study
mission should have been approved, the report said in urging that
asylum officers be given ``wider latitude to approve cases _ to err
always in favor of the applicant.''
   It also found ``a handful of Central Americans with promising
asylum claims _ but who had no intention of risking detention and
deportation by applying for asylum.''

   Opposition lawmakers stormed out of a
state legislature Friday to protest a Supreme Court verdict settling
claims with the Union Carbide Corp. for the Bhopal gas disaster that
killed at least 3,403 people.
   The Supreme Court also heard arguments on Friday challenging the
government's authority to settle with the Danbury, Conn.-based
company Feb. 14 for damages in the world's worst industrial disaster.
   In Bhopal, all 60 opposition party legislators walked out of the
320-member Madhya Pradesh state legislature to protest the verdict.
   Opposition politicians, newspapers and others have criticized the
settlement, ``ruled full and final,'' as inadequate. The government
originally sued for $3 billion.
   A five-judge Supreme Court panel headed by Judge Sabyasachi
Mukherjee heard arguments on a petition that seeks to strike down
1985 legislation making the government the sole representative of
victims of the gas leak.
   If the law were struck down, ``the entire settlement will fall on
its back,'' said Rajiv Dhavan, an attorney for Union Carbide.
   Union Carbide has already deposited the $470 million with the
court.
   Arguments on the petition are to continue Monday.
   Charanlal Sahu, a Bhopal-based attorney, filed the petition
Wednesday. He says he is among the victims of the leak at a
pesticide plant in the central Indian city on Dec. 3, 1984.
   The leak of poisonous methyl isocyanate gas killed more than
3,400 people and injured at least 20,000 others. The plant was
operated by Union Carbide of India Ltd., a subsidiary of the
U.S.-based multinational company.
   More than 570,000 claims were filed with the government by people
who said they were harmed by the disaster.

<HEAD>Afghan President Asks Aid As Rebels Threaten Jalalabad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Najib of Afghanistan on Friday asked the
United States and the Soviet Union to intervene to stop fierce
guerrilla attacks on Jalalabad and other eastern cities, news
reports said.
   ``As one of the guarantors of the Geneva accords, I ask you, in
light of your responsibility, to take immediate necessary measures
and prevent, by every possible means, a further intensification and
aggravation of the situation,'' said Najib's message, read on Kabul
radio and monitored by the BBC.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported ``fierce
fighting'' around the Jalalabad airport, with U.S.-backed Moslem
rebels launching artillery shells, missiles and anti-tank guided
missiles at Afghan army positions. The Soviet-backed government's
troops responded with concentrated bombing.
   Government casualties apparently were heavy. Tass reported that
reinforcements ``making up for recent losses in manpower'' brought
the Jalalabad garrison to 15,000.
   Jalalabad is about 80 miles east of the capital, Kabul, and 45
miles west of the border with Pakistan, where many Afghan guerrilla
groups are based.
   Tass said rebel leaders have ordered a massive coordinated
shelling attack on all large cities and supply routes. Separately,
it reported shelling of the Kabul airport with no loss of life.
   Najib's message repeated earlier claims that Pakistani troops
were massing on the border for an attack.
   Moscow finished pulling out its troops from Afghanistan last
month under a U.N.-brokered accord, signed in Geneva, that ended the
Red Army's nine-year intervention. Moslem guerrillas have formed a
government-in-exile and plan to topple the Kabul government.
   Also Friday, PLO leader Yasser Arafat said he and Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi of India were trying to help bring peace to
Afghanistan, United News of India reported.
   ``We are doing our best to achieve a final settlement in the
Afghanistan issue,'' the news agency quoted Arafat as saying as he
inaugurated the New Delhi embassy of the recently declared state of
Palestine.
   Arafat refused to give any details. He later met Afghanistan's
ambassador to New Delhi, Abdul Samad Azhar, UNI said.
   On Thursday, Arafat met in Pakistan with leaders of the Afghan
guerrillas.
   The PLO leader told the guerrillas to be more politically
realistic, according to a source close to them who spoke on
condition of anonymity. That could mean compromising with the
Soviet-style government of President Najib.
   Arafat flew from Islamabad to New Delhi on Thursday for a state
visit lasting about 21 hours, before heading to Bangladesh.

   A bomb exploded Friday on a main road
north of Israel's self-declared ``security zone,'' wounding two
Israeli soldiers and four other people, officials said.
   Police in Lebanon the six included Israeli troops and allied
Lebanese militiamen. In Jerusalem, an Israeli army official said the
victims included two Israeli soldiers and four Lebanese civilians.
   The conflicting reports could not immediately be reconciled.
   The police said the explosion occurred along the main
Kawkaba-Marjayoun road in the southern Lebanese town of Marjayoun,
about six miles north of the security zone. The region is patrolled
by Norwegian soldiers working in the United Nations peacekeeping
force.
   The Israeli official said one of the civilians was seriously
wounded and was flown to Rambam Hospital in the northern Israeli
city of Haifa.
   In Beirut, the pro-Iranian Siite Moslem Hezbollah, or Party of
God, claimed responsibility for the roadside bomb. The group said
four Israeli helicopter gunships evacuated the casualties and that
fires were blazing in the area.
   ``An Islamic resistance squad carried out a courageous operation
against the Israeli enemy in the Marjeyoun area,'' a Hezbollah
statement said.
   The Islamic resistance, a coalition of Iranian-backed groups, has
been involved in guerrilla warfare in the security zone, which has a
predominantly Shiite Moslem population.
   U.N. peacekeeping troops and Israeli soldiers were put on alert
and a joint Israeli-SLA force immediately blanketed the area with
machine gun fire, said a police spokesman who cannot be identified
under standing rules.
   Tension has been running high between Israeli troops and
peacekeepers serving with the U.N. Interim Force in south Lebanon.
   On Thursday, Israeli troops beat up four U.N. peacekeepers near
their headquarters in the Lebanese border town of Naqoura, according
to security sources in south Lebanon.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said six
Israeli troops went into a restaurant on the main road to Naqoura,
where they harassed and slapped one Irish and three Swedish soldiers
before confiscating their cameras and films.
   The Israeli troops accused the four U.N. soldiers of taking
pictures of an Israeli-made Merkava tank they were aboard before
entering the restaurant, the sources said.
   On Tuesday, Israeli troops drove a tank into a group of UNIFIL
vehicles after the peacekeepers detained an Israeli military convoy
at a checkpoint in south Lebanon. No U.N. soldiers were injured,
although several vehicles were damaged, according to U.N. sources.
   The security zone is a six- to 10-mile wide buffer retained by
Israel after it withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in
1985, ending a three-year occupation. Israeli troops patrol the area
looking for Palestinian guerrillas who sometimes cross the border to
attack Israeli settlements.

   The Washington state apple industry Friday
reported an increase in sales, indicating their product is popular
despite concerns over use of a possibly hazardous chemical.
   But officials for the Natural Resources Defense Council, whose
report last week said there was an increased risk of cancer for
children who eat apples treated with Alar, a chemical which
regulates the fruit's growth, questioned the sales figures.
   ``I don't think you can believe those figures,'' said Janet
Hathaway, an NRDC attorney and co-author of the report ``Intolerable
Risk: Pesticides In Our Children's Food.''
   Ms. Hathaway said virtually every parent she has talked to
recently is looking for organic sources of apples, and that she has
received phone calls from growers saying they cannot sell
Alar-treated apples.
   The Washington apple industry, which supplies about two-thirds of
the nation's supermarket apples this time of year, reported shipping
a record 1.56 million 42-pound boxes between March 2 and March 9,
said Bill DeWitt of the Wenatchee Valley Traffic Association.
   That was up from 1.51 million boxes the week before, and 1.4
million boxes for the same period last year, DeWitt said.
   ``It's indicating to us that people still like apples and they're
still buying them,'' said DeWitt, manager of the industry trade
group that compiles shipment figures from warehouses in the state.
   ``The apple market has not suffered nearly what we thought when
the bad publicity came out,'' DeWitt said in a telephone interview.
   Alar, trade name for the chemical daminozide, is sprayed on apple
trees to help the apples stay on longer, improving color and
crispness and giving farmers more time to harvest. The Environmental
Protection Agency has said it intends to ban Alar by 1990, based on
preliminary cancer tests on mice and rats, but it is still legal to
use.
   Last week's NRDC report drew widespread attention and resulted in
some cancelled shipments. New York schools stopped selling apples in
cafeterias and a Taiwan exporter cancelled an order for 5,000 boxes
of Washington apples.
   But the nation's 20,000 growers have responded with a $1 million
public relations campaign pointing out that only a small portion of
the crop is treated with Alar, and that eating apples is still safe.
   The Washington Apple Commission has said about 5 percent of the
crop is treated with Alar. The NRDC disputes that, putting the
figure at over 10 percent, Ms. Hathaway said.
   The shipment figures show apples that are purchased by all
out-of-state retailers, exporters and other apple users, DeWitt said.
   ``They're buying them because they know they can sell them,''
DeWitt said.
   Many major retail chains and apple juice processors accept only
Alar-free apples and ``to the best of my knowledge that's exactly
what we are shipping,'' DeWitt said.

<TEXT>
   One of three young men charged with killing
a convenience store clerk while they were teen-agers killed himself
Friday, four hours before a jury was to resume deliberating his
guilt or innocence.
   Scott Davis, 21, on trial at Guntersville on a capital murder
charge in the 1985 killing of Missy Macon, shot himself at his
family's home in Ragland without leaving a suicide note, Coroner
Charles Forman said. He had been free on bond since shortly after
the killing.
   His two co-defendants are serving life prison terms.
   Davis had claimed the three honor students were playing a fantasy
game when Mrs. Macon was shot.
   Davis' attorney, Louis Wilkinson, told the jury at Guntersville,
where the trial was moved because of publicity in St. Clair County,
that Davis thought his companions, Cayce Moore and Chris White, were
going to pretend to rob the store where Mrs. Macon worked.
   Davis had said he did not realize it was not a game until he
heard the shot that killed Mrs. Macon and saw Moore leave the store
with a bottle of wine.
   ``When I saw the wine, I knew right then that something bad had
happened, because when you're 17, you can't buy wine,'' Davis said.
   ``He really, honest to God, thought it was going to be something
harmless,'' Wilkinson said.
   Moore was convicted in September 1987 of capital murder and
sentenced to life without parole. White later pleaded guilty to
murder and also received a life sentence, with the possibility of
parole.
   Davis and Moore were 17 at the time of the killing, while White
was 14.
   White has testified there was no discussion of playing any
fantasy game before he and the two other went to the store.
   Earlier this week, Davis had testified that the night of Mrs.
Macon's killing, Moore asked him if he had a death wish. Davis said
that in the game ``Top Secret,'' that meant a character had gone as
far as he could, and would go against something he could not beat.
   Davis said he told Moore he did have a death wish.
   ``I guess I meant I wanted to play,'' he said.
   On Thursday, the prosecution introduced two suicide notes written
by Davis to his parents the day after Mrs. Macon's death.
   ``Mom, I wish a million times that I hadn't done it,'' Davis read
from one of the notes.
   ``We all thought it was a dream, but that dream turned into a
nightmare. Killing the lady didn't bother me, but being without you
is like a living hell.
   ``Mom, I knew it was wrong for us to do it. It started out as a
game.''
   District Attorney Van Davis said Davis knew of the plan to rob
the store and helped plan it.
   ``This game stuff was fabricated for one reason: defense of
murder,'' the prosecutor said. ``The real issue is Missy Macon lying
on the floor of that convenience store in a pool of blood and that
cash register cleaned out.
   ``There is no reason on earth why Missy Macon has to be dead.
Nowhere is it written that defense for a murder is that you were
playing a game.''
   The prosecutor said he thought they robbed a store in Ragland,
rather than somewhere they were not known, ``because they were so
taken in by how smart they were and by how good they were at these
games they thought they could rob and kill anywhere and get away
with it.''
   After the shooting, the three drove to Florida, where Davis said
he and Moore planned to kill themselves.
   ``We decided we couldn't live anymore,'' Davis said. They later
decided against committing suicide and were arrested at a rest stop.

   Here is a transcript of remarks Friday by
President Bush and Rep. Richard Cheney as the president announced
his selection of the Republican congressman from Wyoming to be
secretary of defense and they answered reporters' questions.
   Bush: Well, good afternoon.
   I am happy to be here this afternoon to present my nominee to be
secretary of defense: Congressman Dick Cheney of Wyoming.
   Dick is a widely respected man of principle, served his country
with distinction for many years.
   I have known him as a chief of staff, government manager, all
under President Ford, '75 and '76.
   I worked with him closely as he's been a part of the Republican
leadership.
   In both the executive branch and in Congress, he's dealt with the
problems of national defense, he's struggled with the budget,
certainly as every president has to do, and he's weighed the
difficult national defense priorities that have come before the
Congress.
   He's been a member of the intelligence committee for I think five
years, and a leader of that in that area.
   I've heard his thinking on arms control, Central American policy,
strategic defense posture, and on the difficult challenges that he
knows he faces of reforming procurement process in the Pentagon.
   He's a thoughtful man, a quiet man, a strong man, approaches
public policy with vigor, determination and diligence.
   And this afternoon, we discussed the defense needs of this nation
and the heavy responsibilities that go with being secretary of
defense.
   Now, Dick Cheney is a trusted friend and adviser, and I'm
convinced that he's going to be a great leader of our nation's
military forces.
   And now, I'd like to ask him to say a few words, and then he and
I will be glad to respond to a few questions.
   So, Dick, welcome aboard and thank you for undertaking this very
complicated and difficult assignment.
   You'll do great.

   The president said he will seek legislation empowering the
government to block such exports.
   ``We're determined to work with other concerned governments to
exercise wide stewardship over our environment, particularly where
matters of health are concerned,'' Bush said in remarks at the
swearing-in ceremony for Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan.
   In the case of U.S. firms, the most frequently used countries for
hazardous waste disposal are Canada and Mexico, an Environmental
Protection Agency official said. The United States has agreements
with both nations for safe handling of the material, said EPA
assistant director for policy Linda Fisher.
   Ninety percent of such wastes goes to Canada, she said. Besides
Mexico, the other recipient nations are Brazil, Japan and several in
Western Europe. No agreements for safe disposal exist with those
countries, she said.
   However, all of those nations recycle the wastes, so there have
been no serious health or environment situations created by the
disposal there, she said.
   The concerns addressed in Bush's proposal are mostly
``futuristic,'' to provide a preventative mechanism, she said.
   Environmentalists have raised concerns that some countries,
particularly in the developing world, do not regulate disposal and
handling of such wastes in an environmentally safe manner.
   Bush said the legislation he will send to Congress ``will give
the U.S. government the authority to ban all exports of hazardous
waste except where we have an agreement with the receiving country
providing for the safe handling and management of those wastes.''

<HEAD>Southern Illinois University Releases Report On Racist Jokes</HEAD>

   A Southern Illinois University student
placed racist jokes in the university's computer system, using
another student's access code, and the list later turned up in a
kindergarten class, school officials said Friday.
   ``Although the university per se did not have any direct
involvement, the individuals represent the university and we simply
cannot condone this matter,'' SIU President John Guyon said.
   He did not identify the students involved but said the university
was considering disciplinary action. The jokes were directed
primarily at blacks.
   The president of the local NAACP chapter, Nathaniel Felder, who
also is director of planning and computing for the university
system, said he was pleased that SIU took the matter seriously.
Blacks make up about 10 percent of the 24,227-member student body at
SIU-Carbondale.
   Other than that, Felder said, ``I can't comment on the
(university) report.''
   SIU learned of the problem in December, when a 5-year-old black
boy took home used university computer printouts that had been given
to his kindergarten class for use as scratch paper.
   One month later, the same child took home another SIU printout
that was part of the same joke list. His mother then contacted the
NAACP, which urged the university to investigate.
   Guyon appointed a committee Jan. 16 to investigate and its
report, released Friday, concluded that an undergraduate student put
the joke file, about 30 pages long, into the university's computer
system sometime last fall.
   The file was printed in November in the campus central computer
facility, and the printout apparently was discarded, the report said.
   A graduate student working at Glendale School, where the child is
enrolled, delivered the computer paper to the school to be used as
scratch paper, university officials said.
   ``The committee finds no intentional connection between the use
of the University's computing system and the child's receipt of the
paper on which the offensive material was printed,'' the report said.
   But it said the student who placed the file in the university's
system used another student's access code and ``later demonstrated
little remorse or concern.''
   The report recommended that Guyon review procedures for obtaining
access to university computers and decide whether the students
involved should be disciplined.
   ``The committee sincerely regrets that a child and his family
were subjected to offensive materials that were reproduced on
university facilities,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
   FBI Director William Sessions said Friday that
semiautomatic assault weapons have a ``very destructive impact on
American society and the people'' but declined to say whether they
should be outlawed.
   In the strongest statement yet from a Bush administration
official about the weapons, Sessions echoed concerns expressed by
state and local law enforcement following the Jan. 17 fatal
shootings of five California children with a Soviet-style AK-47
rifle.
   ``The presence of these weapons does have a very destructive
impact on American society and the people,'' Sessions told reporters.
   ``Tragedy after tragedy flows from it,'' Sessions said. ``People
and law enforcement officers are victims of these crimes.''
   ``I am sorry we are outgunned and outmanned in that respect,''
the director said.
   But Sessions would not say whether he agreed with other law
enforcement officials who are calling for a ban on the weapons.
   ``It's not my responsiblity to make that kind of decision,''
Sessions said. ``That's a political debate I will not participate
in.''
   President Bush has resisted calls for outlawing the weapons, many
of which can be altered to become automatic rifles, such as the
weapon a man used to spray more than 100 rounds of ammunition
outside an elementary school in Stockton, Calif.
   The president, however, said earlier this week that he wanted to
find a method of preventing the criminal use of the weapons while
doing ``what's right by the legitimate sportsman.''
   Bush, a member of the National Rifle Association, said he had
asked William Bennett, picked by the president to direct the
nation's war on drugs, to study the proliferation of assault weapons.
   Sessions, meanwhile, defended the FBI's background investigation
of John Tower during the former Texas senator's unsuccessful bid to
win Senate confirmation as defense secretary.
   The lengthy investigation of Tower prompted criticism by some
senators that the FBI was conveying unsupported rumors and
allegations about the former Republican senator.
   Tower's drinking habits, relationships with women and financial
ties were criticized during the debate leading up to Thursday's
53-47 Senate vote to reject the nominee.
   But Sessions, who removed himself from the Tower investigation
because of past political ties, said ``the bureau carried out its
function in this case as I'm sure it did in hundreds of other
cases.''
   ``We have had absolutely no criticism at all concerning the
conduct of the investigation from the White House,'' Sessions said,
adding that he saw ``no need to change at all'' the FBI's procedures
for conducting such background checks.
   Floyd Clarke, the bureau's director of investigations, said the
FBI carefully tries to verify any derogatory allegations made about
a nominee.
   Later in the day, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh also defended
the FBI, saying ``the criticism results from a misunderstanding of
what the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is in carrying
out background checks.''
   ``It is not the job of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to
make judgmenets about the individuals'' nominated for government
posts, Thornburgh said. ``It is their job to gather information.''
   ``No one to my knowledge has any quarrel with the accuracy of the
job that's been done by the FBI,'' Thornburgh said.
   Responding to reports of friction with the attorney general,
Sessions said he enjoyed a ``direct, cordial'' relationship with the
Thornburgh.
   But Sessions said he had stopped holding informal breakfast
meetings with members of Congress. The attorney general, who has
told officials the Justice Department will ``speak with one voice,''
reportedly was irritated that Sessions had not cleared the meetings
with his office.
   ``I regard the attorney general of the United States as the
person for whom I work at the Department of Justice,'' Sessions
said. ``I agreed fully with his one-voice concept, I think it's very
important we speak in that fashion.''
   He called reports that Thornburgh was trying to get him to take a
federal appellate judgeship were ``as much a surprise to me as
anyone.''
   Sessions said he intended to continue as FBI director.

<TEXT>
   The jury in the Fawaz Younis sky piracy trial
began deliberations Friday under instructions from the judge that
undercut the defendant's argument that he was acting under militia
orders when he hijacked a plane in Beirut.
   ``Orders to hijack a plane ... are illegal orders,'' U.S.
District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. told jurors. ``Obedience to
illegal orders is no defense.''
   The judge said that only if Younis did not know that hijacking
was illegal should he be acquitted.
   The jury deliberated for about for hours. Deliberations will
resume Monday.
   Younis was on the stand for two days in the nine-day trial,
testifying that the military commander of Lebanon's Amal militia,
Aqil Hamiyya, ordered him to lead four other heavily armed men in
the hijacking of Royal Jordanian Airlines flight 402 on June 11,
1985.
   Under cross-examination, Younis has testified that he knew that
hijacking was illegal in peacetime, and that Amal was not at war
with Royal Jordanian Airlines, the government of Jordan, the two
Americans aboard the aircraft, or any of the other 70 passengers and
crew members.
   He did not attempt to refute testimony by five eyewitnesses who
pointed him out in the courtroom as the leader in the hijacking.
   Defense attorney Frank D. Carter sought to persuade the jury that
Younis acted as he did because he was a victim of the civil war that
has engulfed Lebanon since 1975.
   Younis, now 30, was arrested on Sept. 13, 1987, by members of the
FBI hostage rescue team who, working closely with the U.S. military
and intelligence agencies, lured him aboard a yacht in international
waters in the Mediterranean Sea.
   The case is viewed as a test of a 1984 ``long-arm'' statute that
asserts U.S. jurisdiction over cases involving American hostages
taken abroad.
   The counts against Younis, and the maximum possible sentences for
each, are: hostage taking, life in prison; aircraft piracy, 20
years; performing acts of violence against individuals, 20 years;
destruction of a civilian aircraft, 20 years; carrying aboard an
aircraft devices likely to endanger its safety, 20 years, and
conspiracy to commit a hijacking, five years.

   Cheney: Thank you very much, Mr. President.
   Obviously, things have moved rather rapidly in the last 24 hours.
   I am honored to be asked by the president to join his
administration.
   I look forward very much to working with him, and especially also
with Brent Scowcroft, who's an old friend of many years standing,
and with Jim Baker, who's an old friend of many years standing, in
the difficult assignment ahead.
   And I think the next four years hold significant challenge in
terms of U.S. defense policy and foreign policy, and I am glad to be
a part of the team and eager to get to work in terms of helping the
president address some of those very important issues.
   Q. Congressman, two questions. First, could you give us an update
on your health? And also, what can you tell us about the depth of
the expertise you feel you have on defense?
   Cheney: Well, first of all, with respect to my health, I have in
the past been a heart patient.
   Many of you know I underwent bypass surgery in August of last
year.
   I was, after that surgery, back at work in about three weeks.
   I skied at Christmastime at Vail _ if anybody's curious _ and
skiing was very good at Vail at Christmastime.
   And I talked just this afternoon with my cardiologist, who has
followed my case for several years, and to make certain he was aware
of this, and so that he would be in a position to say _ as he has,
as he did tell me just today _ that there's absolutely no medical
reason why I cannot undertake this assignment.
   I have no restrictions at this point in terms of my own
activities.
   With respect to my background in the defense area, it's an issue
that I've _ a set of issues that I've been interested in for a long
time; obviously had some exposure to them during the Ford years when
I served as White House chief of staff and sat in on all the
National Security Council meetings.
   I've had an active interest in it in the Congress, and currently
serve as the senior Republican on the budget subcommittee of the
intelligence committee, which authorizes all of our intelligence
programs and the activities of many defense agencies, such as the
National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, all of the
tactical intelligence programs across all the services in the
Pentagon.
   So, obviously, there are areas that I need to know and that I'll
have to work hard on to master, but I feel that I do have a depth of
understanding now in very specific areas that come within the
general jurisdiction of the Defense Department and national security
in general.
   Q. Mr. President _
   Q. Mr. President _
   Bush: Helen and then Terry _ or am I getting out of protocol.

   President Bush's nomination of Rep. Dick Cheney
as defense secretary won bipartisan applause Friday from
congressional colleagues of the Wyoming Republican.
   ``He's a very able and impressive person,'' said Sen. Tim Wirth,
D-Colo. ``He's one of the smartest people in Congress.''
   ``An excellent choice,'' said Sen. Charles Robb, the freshman
from Virginia who was one of the last Democrats to announce his
opposition to John Tower, whom the Senate had refused to confirm as
defense secretary Thursday.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services Committee chairman who
led the Democrats' fight against Tower, issued a joint statement
with Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the committee's senior
Republican, that said:
   ``Dick Cheney is well known and highly respected by the members
of the Senate. We have worked with him on many issues involving
national defense and intelligence matters.''
   Nunn and Warner said that, at Bush's request, the committee would
open hearings on the nomination next week.
   Nunn, speaking to reporters in Philadelphia, said, ``I know of no
impediment to his nomination.
   And Warner said he found Cheney's choice ``a wonderful, perfect
nomination.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine said he was
``pleased that President Bush has moved quickly'' and added that
Cheney ``has served with distinction in the U.S. House of
Representatives since 1978.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole quickly hailed the appointment
in a barbed comment that reflected the bitterness lingering from the
Tower confirmation struggle.
   ``He's tough. That's what we wanted. A tough, tough, tough guy,''
he said of Cheney. ``This time it will be a confirmation, not an
execution.''
   Praise for Cheney, a six-term congressman and the No. 2
Republican in the House, cut widely across party lines, with both
Democrats and Republicans bruised by the lengthy battle over Tower
indicating they hope Cheney will be quickly confirmed.
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley called the appointement
``splendid'' and added, ``I would predict an early and unanimous
confirmation.''
   ``It's a very fine selection,'' said Rep. Charles Bennett,
D-Fla., a member of the House Armed Services Committee.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., another member of the Senate
committee that will consider Cheney's confirmation, had high praise
as well, but said he would not give final judgement until hearings
are held.
   ``I know of no reason why it wouldn't be unanimous, but I want to
reserve judgment,'' said Gore.
   ``I like him a lot,'' he said. ``I served with him in the House.
... While I am going to reserve final judgment particularly as a
member of the committee I know of no reason at this point not to
accept speedy confirmation.''
   But the initial reaction from those who have known Cheney was
that Bush had made a shrewd choice.
   ``Dick Cheney is a close friend and colleague,'' said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and
one of the strongest supporters of Tower.
   ``I have the greatest respect for his broad range of experience
and knowledge,'' said McCain. ``I look favorably on this nomination
and hope that he will be confirmed expeditiously.''
   ``Few people in Washington understand the executive and
legislative branches of government as well as Dick Cheney,'' said
Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the House Democratic Whip. ``This is
a smart move on the part of the president but a great move on behalf
of the country.''
   And Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., one of the most conservative
members of the Senate, said ``on first glance it looks like a very
good appointment. He has long experience in Congress and the
executive branch. He appears to have a very solid record on defense
issues.''
   Bill Greener, a former Air Force colonel and the Pentagon's chief
spokesman during the Ford administration, when Cheney was White
House chief of staff, said Friday the congressman was ``a perfect
choice.''
   ``There should be loud cheers in Washington,'' Greener said.
   ``He's a great manager. He is a quick learner with an absolute
amazing mentality. And he's always been a `strong defense' person.
He's also very open and easy going. He's a perfect choice.''

<TEXT>
   The leftist Social Democrats and West Berlin's
equivalent of the anti-NATO Greens formed a government Friday that
pledges to reduce Allied military control of the city and curb
police action against street protest.
   The coalition agreement between the Social Democrats and the
far-left Alternative List won nearly unanimous approval Friday at a
special Social Democrat congress. An Alternative List meeting is
scheduled for Sunday.
   Walter Momper of the Social Democrats is to become mayor when the
new legislature meets next week, replacing Eberhard Diepgen, whose
Christian Democrats were set back in the Jan. 29 city elections.
   Voters gave the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats 55 seats
each in the 138-member legislature and the Alternative List got 17.
The far-right Republican Party won the other 11.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats have been slipping
in opinion polls, and the so-called ``Red-Green'' government in West
Berlin will be a major test of whether such a coalition can work
nationally.
   Several polls have indicated Kohl's center-right coalition may
lose the national elections in December 1990.
   ``I think that with this Red-Green coalition ... alternative
policies will play a much more essential role than before in the
city and on the federal level,'' Alternative List leader Christian
Stroebele told reporters.
   He said there will be ``decisive change in the city and that will
have a ripple effect'' throughout West Germany.
   Under the agreement, the Alternative List will control three city
departments: environment and development, schooling and sports, and
women, youth and family.
   The party has advocated stronger environmental controls, curbs on
police, restrictions on the use of motor vehicles and more
government-subsidized housing.
   Otto Schily, a prominent Greens member of the federal parliament,
said his party and the Social Democrats should study the possibility
of a national coalition.
   Business spokesmen have said some companies might leave West
Berlin because of the leftist government, particularly if it raises
taxes to finance social programs.
   The Christian Democrats had dominated city politics in recent
years and promoted business develoment to help reduce the isolation
of West Berlin, which is 90 miles inside communist East German.

   Oliver North's former White House boss
testified Friday that James A. Baker III suggested to then-President
Reagan in 1984 he could be impeached for allowing solicitation of
money from other countries for the Nicaraguan Contras.
   The suggestion by Baker, then Reagan's chief of staff and now
President Bush's secretary of state, ``was strongly countered'' by
other top officials at a meeting with Reagan, with the conclusion
that Baker was wrong, testified former National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane.
   Still, Reagan said ``we'll all be hanging by our thumbs'' if word
got out that McFarlane or other administration officials were indeed
seeking help from abroad at a time that Congress had forbidden
direct U.S. aid to the Contras, according to minutes of the meeting
read into the court record.
   McFarlane, testifying at North's trial, said Reagan knew in 1984
that arrangements had been made to get $1 million a month from Saudi
Arabia for the the U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua.
   ``I told the president, I told Adm. (John) Poindexter, Colonel
North knew of it,'' McFarlane said.
   However, he testified later in the day that he himself had been
unaware of various North activities that have been described by
other witnesses in the trial and earlier in congressional hearings.
   For example, McFarlane said he didn't know that North was
involved in private fund-raising from wealthy donors, that it was
North who decided how the money would be spent, or that North was
instrumental in setting up a southern front for the guerrillas
fighting the Nicaraguan government.
   ``I did know North had given a number of speeches,'' McFarlane
testified about the money raising.
   One man who contributed to the Contra cause, beer magnate Joseph
Coors, testified briefly Friday. When he was finished, he walked
over to an apparently surprised North and shook his hand.
   Though all the witnesses so far have been called by the
prosecution, they have generally spoken highly of North, with whom
they worked in efforts to aid the Contras.
   McFarlane, testifying about North's military adivice and
activities in Nicaragua, said:
   ``I had been in the military for 20 years and I knew the
activities of a single officer in setting up a southern front was
inconsequential. It did not occur to me that Colonel North in
Washington, not in the field 90 percent of the time, could set up a
southern front.''
   McFarlane testified he instructed North to do everything he could
to keep the rebels functioning after the United States cut off
official aid in 1984.
   He was questioned about six memos, written to him by North
between Dec. 4, 1984, and May 31, 1985, that showed North's deep
involvement with the Nicaraguan Contras. Charges against North
include lying to Congress by saying he wasn't doing anything for the
rebels.
   The memos:
   _ Dec. 4, 1984: North reports the Contras are ``in urgent need of
anti-aircraft weapons ... in urgent need of expertise in maritime
operations ... in need of financial support, munitions, and training
assistance.''
   _ Feb. 6, 1985: North asks McFarlane to authorize the sinking of
a ship in the East China Sea carrying arms to the Sandinistas.
Nothing ever came of that suggestion.
   _ March 5, 1985: North suggests ways to compensate Guatemala for
helping get arms to the Contras by signing phony ``end user''
certificates for weapons. On the witness stand, McFarlane said he
didn't even look at the certificates.
   _ March 16, 1985: North suggests a fallback plan in case Congress
does not authorize resumption of aid to the Contras, including
persuading private donors ``of the need to continue their funding
for munitions after Oct. 1, 1985.''
   _April 11, 1985: North says $24.5 million has been spent by the
rebels since U.S. aid expired in May 1984, mostly for ammunition,
and ``the resistance has grown from 9,500 personnel in June 1984 to
over 16,000 today.''
   _ May 31, 1985: North reports ``there are today more combatants
actively in the field than at any time in the last 12 months.''
   McFarlane's face reddened at the start of his testimony when he
was asked by chief prosecutor John Keker, ``Did you try to commit
suicide?''
   ``Yes,'' said McFarlane, looking at the jury, ``On Feb. 9,
1987.'' That was shortly before release of a White House-ordered
report on the Iran-Contra affair and the beginning of congressional
hearings.
   McFarlane told, too, of pleading guilty to four charges of
withholding information from Congress and of being sentenced to two
years' probation, 200 hours of community service and fines of
$20,000.
   During a June 25, 1984, discussion of allowing money to be
solicited from other countries, McFarlane said, Baker suggested
Reagan could be impeached.
   ``I recall Mr. Baker believed that if the president were to
authorize procuring money from third countries that that would be a
violation of law and the president could be so charged and impeached
... removed from office,'' McFarlane testified.
   ``I remember that statement and its being strongly countered, the
conclusion being that it was not true,'' he said.
   He recalled that at that meeting of the National Security Council
Planning Group, which included in its membership Reagan, then-Vice
President Bush and the secretaries of state and defense, Reagan said
he did not want any leaks about the third-country support for the
Contras.
   Keker, reading from minutes of the meeting, quoted Reagan as
saying, ``If such a story gets out, we'll all be hanging by our
thumbs in front of the White House until we find out who did it.''
   McFarlane testified, ``He never did say, `Go lie to Congress.' He
did say when learning of foreign contributions to the Contras, `just
do not share that information.'''

   Q. You said that Senator Tower was the best qualified for this
job. Where does Congressman Cheney stand in this priority?
   Bush: I said that on _ I said that on December whatever it was,

   And as of today, Dick Cheney is the best _ (laughter) _ and the
proper choice.
   Q. Do you agree with the vice president in his harsh indictment

   I expect he felt as strongly as many of the senators, having
served in the Senate.
   But look, that's history.
   We're moving forward with a new nominee.
   I told the senators yesterday when they called, both Senator
Mitchell and Senator Nunn _ I think Marlin had the release on that _
that I was going to work with the Congress.
   Dick Cheney and I have discussed that.
   He's confident he can work with the Congress, both Senate and
House.
   And so, there's no point in my dwelling on what happened
yesterday.
   I've got my own views about it, but we've got a big problem out
here, and we need to work cooperatively in defense with the Senate
and with the House.
   And we're going to do just that, as Dick Cheney is confirmed.
   Yes _ and then I'll be back in the middle.
   Q. Mr. President, you said when you originally picked your
Cabinet, that you didn't want to pick anybody from the House or
Senate because you didn't want to deplete the ranks of Republicans
in Congress. Now you've picked Mr. Cheney. What happened to that
rule?
   Bush: This is the exception that proves that rule. (Laughter.)
   Yes, John?
   Q. For Mr. Cheney. You've said many times that you've enjoyed
your work in Congress. Why would you give up a post on the
leadership ladder in the House? Are you frustrated because you think
that the Republicans are going to be in a minority position ad
infinitum, or why have you suddenly decided, now, to go into the
executive branch?
   Cheney: Well, I _ first of all, John, I'm optimistic about the
future of the Republican Party in Congress.
   I think we will become a majority within the next few years.
   Obviously, I've loved the House of Representatives.
   I've enjoyed it immensely.
   It _ I thought that that's where I would spend the bulk of my
political career.
   But, when the president asks you to consider a proposition such
as this one, you have to take it seriously.
   And when you look at the challenge that's involved, the
importance that he assigns to the problems that have to be addressed
in this area, and the basic attraction of taking on a difficult task
_ after I agonized over it, and I did agonize _ it was not an easy
decision _ I decided that I would, in fact, accept the post of
secretary of defense.

   American-born John Hull, who has been
linked to the Nicaraguan rebel supply network, was released from
prison Friday after he posted $37,500 bail, his defense lawyer said.
   Attorney Rita Herrera said the 69-year-old Hull, jailed Jan. 13
on charges of drug trafficking and violating Costa Rican security,
was freed shortly after friends collected enough money to meet bail.
   ``Since Mr. Hull lacked the money, many friends ... offered to
help him and this afternoon we were able to gather all the bail
money,'' Ms. Herrera told The Associated Press by telephone from San
Carlos, where the proceedings against Hull are taking place.
   The town is 100 miles to the north, near the Nicaraguan border
and Hull's farm.
   Ms. Herrera said Hull was resting at the home of a friend, but
she declined to say where.
   A Superior Penal Court judge in Alajuela ruled on Thursday that
Hull could be released and set bond. It earlier refused to release
Hull on bond.
   Hull, originally from Evansville, Ind., has lived in Costa Rica
for 20 years, and his lawyers say he became a Costa Rican citizen
eight years ago.
   While in jail, he had a heart attack and was hospitalized for
three weeks.
   Hull is accused of allowing his ranch to be used by the
Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, and for narcotics trafficking
between 1982 and 1985.
   He denied the charges.

   Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass., who was
considered an early favorite in the 1990 race to succeed retiring
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, announced Friday that he and
his wife are separating and that he will not run for governor.
   Kennedy, 36, son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, released a
statement through his Boston office saying:
   ``This has been a very painful day for me and my family. As a
father, my principal obligation and deepest personal desire is to
assist my children through the most difficult time in their lives.''
   The two-term congressman added that ``I also have a commitment to
serve the people of the 8th Congressional District, therefore I feel
it impossible at this time to take on the added burden of running
for another office.
   ``To end any further speculation, I wish to make it clear that I
do not intend to run for governor.''
   In a separate statement, Kennedy said that he and his wife,
Sheila, have decided to separate ``only after long and intense
efforts to find another course. We consider it to be a personal
matter and don't intend to comment on it further.''
   The Kennedys, married in 1979, have twin sons, Matthew and Joseph
P. III.
   ``I intend to give a great deal of my time and energies to Matt
and Joe,'' Kennedy said in his statement.
   Aide Jim Mahoney said Kennedy left Boston on Friday to spend the
weekend with his sons. Aides declined to say where he had gone and
said he would be unavailable for comment.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the congressman's uncle who is
divorced, said he was ``very sad for Joe and Sheila. I love them
both and I love their children, and I know how difficult this time
can be for their family.''
   During his time in Congress, Mrs. Kennedy and the children
generally had remained at the family's home in the Brighton section
of Boston while the congressman commuted from Washington on
weekends, an arrangement similar to that of many lawmakers.
   Kennedy, oldest male in the rising generation of his prominent
political family, was elected in 1986 and re-elected in 1988.
   He was 15 when his father was shot to death in 1968 while seeking
the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Rep. Kennedy had been leading in most early gubernatorial polls
in Massachusetts.

   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak warned
on Friday that the timetable set by the International Monetary Fund
for economic reforms in his country could cause political and social
upheaval in Egypt.
   The IMF wants Mubarak to speed up his reforms before a new
meeting can be held on a rescheduling of Egypt's $44 billion foreign
debt.
   The first such conference was held in May 1987.
   ``We are not against the reforms.'' the Egyptian president told
reporters. ``It is the timetable that bothers us.''
   Mubarak spoke after meeting with senior European Economic
Community officials in Brussels, including EEC Commission President
Jacques Delors.
   His stop was part of a European tour to win support for an
international Middle East peace conference which Israel opposes.
   He outlined his economic reform program in his talks with Delors
and explained the political and social risks inherent in speeding
them up.
   International banks want Mubarak to slash Egypt's budget deficit,
apply energy price reforms, liberalize interest rates and
rationalize its multitier exchange rate system.
   ``But some price reforms the IMF is asking of us would mean
increasing some prices sevenfold,'' Mubarak said.
   Earlier Friday, the EEC approved two development projects
totaling $4.9 million.
   The bulk of the money _ $3.33 million _ will go to a four-year
rural development project in the Nile Valley.
   The remainder will go to promote joint ventures, notably between
small and medium enterprises in the EEC and Egypt.
   On the Middle East, Mubarak said Israel ``should not fear an
international conference (which) cannot impose a (peace) settlement
on anyone.''
   He said the conference ``would only be a guarantee ... for direct
talks between the main actors in the Israeli-Arab conflict.''
   Mubarak said he did not ask Delors to urge the 12 EEC states to
recognize Palestine.
   ``The question of recognition is a detail,'' he said. ``What
counts is that an international peace conference should get off the
ground.''
   Mubarak also denied that Egypt is assembling Swiss-made parts
that could be used to create a chemical weapons plant at Abu Zaabal,
north of Cairo.
   The New York Times said Friday U.S. officials believe Egypt is
doing this.
   Mubarak said, ``This is the first I've heard of it. We are
against chemical weapons and, of course, don't make any such
factories.''
   Mubarak was due to leave Brussels Saturday for The Hague, the
Netherlands, to attend the International Conference on Atmospheric
Pollution.
   He is scheduled to have a private meeting with President Francois
Mitterrand of France, who will also attend the conference.
   On Sunday Mubarak will travel to West Germany for a five-day
state visit.

   Hundreds of Tibetans and sympathizers
carried a wooden coffin and blew horns Friday in a march from U.N.
headquarters to the Chinese U.N. Mission to demand Tibet's
independence from China.
   On the 30th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising, protesters
gathered across the street from the United Nations and chanted
``China out of Tibet!'' and ``U.N. help Tibet!''
   China regards as an internal affair the unrest in Tibet that
killed at least 16 people this week. As a permanent member of the
Security Council, China can block action on Tibetan affairs by
vetoing any proposed resolution.
   A crowd estimated by police at up to 200 people assembled to the
warbling notes of fluted horns that monks in Tibet play as a
religious instrument.
   Speakers recounted the suffering of the Tibetan people after
China crushed the 1959 rebellion, contending that more than 1.2
million Tibetans have been killed and more than 6,000 monasteries
destroyed.
   Carrying such signs as ``Home Rule for Tibet'' and ``Stop Torture
of Monks,'' the protesters marched to China's U.N. Mission to
complete their rally, carrying a coffin labeled ``Over Million
Killed.''
   The march gathered more followers as it wended across Manhattan.
Police estimated 300 arrived at the Chinese Mission, where the
protesters tore to bits a Chinese flag printed on cardboard.
   The organizer of the rally, the U.S. Tibet Committee, is a
private U.S. human rights committee staffed by Tibetans and
Americans that promotes Tibetan independence.

<HEAD>Public Hospital Administrators Say Hospital Care Deteriorating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emergency medical care at public hospitals is
suffering due to increases in AIDS patients, drug overdose cases and
elderly patients, as well as cuts in government funding, hospital
administrators said Friday.
   The problem is so severe that patients requiring emergency
treatment face up to a three-day wait for hospital beds in the New
York City area, and waits of up to 18 hours in Los Angeles and 12
hours in Miami, said Larry S. Gage, president of the National
Association of Public Hospitals.
   Gage said hospitals in Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, Washington,
D.C. and even Memphis, Tenn., are severely strained. Doctors are
facing a challenge to their Hippocratic oath _ to give patients bad
treatment in some cases or no treatment at all, he said..
   ``We are rationing health care for the poor in a necessary,
aggressive way,'' he said.
   Gage was one of more than a dozen speakers at an emergency
conference Friday on indigent care sponsored by the public hospitals
association. The association serves 85 public and non-profit
hospitals.
   ``We know what to do, we just don't have the resources,'' said
Arthur Kellerman, medical director of the emergency department at
Regional Medical Center in Memphis. ``We are being put in the
position of having to give inadequate care to our patients. We have
situations where we have one doctor, two nurses and 30 patients in
the emergency room.''
   Kellerman said a crisis has occurred in the past two years
because hospitals have reduced total beds under pressure from the
federal and state governments, Medicare funding has been cut, and
more and more people are without adequate hospital insurance.
   In addition, many hospitals have instituted cost-containment
programs at government urging at a time when victims of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome are increasing.
   Hospitals also are seeing more drug overdoses as a result of
rising crack cocaine use, and more elderly are being sent to
hospitals rather than nursing homes, he said.
   In Denver, the problem was so severe Thursday night that five of
nine hospitals were on ``ambulance diversion'' _ not accepting any
new emergency patients _ because there were no critical care beds
available, said Kellerman.
   Charity Hospital in New Orleans lost its certification in part
because of a staffing shortage as a result of budget cuts, he said.
   Kellerman said some hospitals have worsened the situation by
phasing out their emergency rooms.
   In Los Angeles, for example, most central public hospitals have
closed their emergency rooms, and people have to travel 30 minutes
to a suburban hospital for treatment, he said. Besides endangering
patients' lives, this also hurts the community by taking ambulances
out of service for long periods of time, he said.
   Gage, who testified earlier this month before Congress on the
issue, said the association is asking Congress to change funding
procedures for hospitals.
   The organization wants to put less emphasis on university
hospitals and more on public hospitals, to change Medicaid funding,
and to consider some form of national health insurance.

<HEAD>Vrdolyak, Daley Each Blame Other for Brawl at Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican mayoral candidate Edward Vrdolyak, who
won the top spot on the city's April election ballot Friday, traded
accusations with Democratic rival Richard M. Daley over who was
behind a melee at a Vrdolyak rally.
   The scuffle broke out while Vrdolyak spoke at a rally Thursday
night on the city's Northwest Side. Witnesses told police the
icident began when three men approached the podium and began booing
the candidate.
   ``It appeared they were going to attack Vrdolyak,'' said Police
Officer Janice Redmond.
   Vrdolyak supporters responded by throwing punches at a dozen
people Vrdolyak said were Daley supporters, and the hecklers fled
the scene. One man, hit in the eye and leg, was treated and released
at Resurrection Hospital, said spokesman Warren Nelson.
   There were no other injuries and no arrests, police said.
   Daley campaign officials denied any involvement and suggested
Vrdolyak himself had set up the incident.
   Vrdolyak said one of the cars was traced to Daley supporters and
that William Daley, the candidate's brother and campaign adviser,
had encouraged the harassment.
   ``All of a sudden three weeks before the election he comes out
with this. This is ridiculous,'' said Daley, Cook County state's
attorney.
   ``If Vrdolyak thinks these people were hired by the Daley
campaign, it is more likely that he or someone in his campaign hired
them so they could blame it on the Daley campaign,'' added Daley
spokeswoman Avis LaVelle.
   Vrdolyak held a news conference to deny the accusation and said
he would withdraw from the race if anyone could prove otherwise.
   Also Friday, the Board of Election Commissioners announced that
Vrdoylak had won the lottery to determine whose name would top the
ballot for the April 4 general election. Daley's name will appear
second, followed by third-party candidate Timothy Evans, a South
Side alderman and the only black in the campaign.
   The election will choose a successor to Harold Washington, the
city's first black mayor.
   Vrdolyak, a former Democratic alderman, switched parties in 1987
and waged a write-in campaign to win the GOP nomination in the
February primary.
   The winner of the general election will serve out the final two
years of Washington's second term. The City Council appointed Eugene
Sawyer acting mayor after Washington died of a heart attack in
November 1987., Sawyer, also black, ran in the Democratic primary
but lost to Daley.

   The Syrian Foreign Ministry said Friday
that two U.S. diplomats who were briefly detained last week by
Palestinian guerrillas had been photographing a Palestinian camp.
   The guerrilla captors, the radical Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command headed by Ahmed Jibril,
claimed the diplomats were working for the Central Intelligence
Agency.
   In Washington, the State Department said Thursday that two
embassy officials were detained by the PFLP-GC outside Damascus for
more than eight hours before being handed over unharmed to Syrian
authorities.
   State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said the government filed
a protest with Syria over the incident and urged Syria to take
action against the PFLP-GC, which she called a terrorist group.
   The Syrian Foreign Ministry statement Friday said Col. Clifford
R. Ward, a military attache at the U.S. Embassy in Damascus, and his
assistant Maj. Peter Seegel, were caught shooting pictures of a
PFLP-GC camp outside the Syrian capital.
   The statement said PFLP-GC guerrillas detained the two diplomats
because they were in a forbidden zone and carried maps and cameras
equipped with zoom lenses.
   ``PFLP-GC guards arrested them while filming ... but the Foreign
Ministry called the United States' ambassador Edward Djerejian and
turned over the two men to him, unharmed,'' the statement added.
   The Syrian-backed Palestinian group issued a statement saying the
two claimed they were Canadian embassy officials when they were
arrested for shooting pictures of one of the group's camps, 25 miles
outside Damascus.
   The PFLP-GC said the diplomats' identities were later revealed
and that they were treated well before being handed over to the
Syrian authorities along ``with their espionage material.''
   ``This is not the first time in which the CIA carries out an
espionage operation to the benefit of the Israeli services,'' the
guerrillas said.
   They said the United States aimed at ``harming the struggle of
the PFLP-GC and at practicing more pressures to blackmail Syria and
make the Syrian stands more flexible to U.S.-Israeli schemes.''
   The group, formed in 1968 by Jibril, a former Syrian army
officer, is fiercely opposed to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Liberation Organization.
   The Syrian Foreign Ministry statement said Djerejian was shown
the diplomats' belongings and was asked to provide a U.S. government
explanation for their behavior ``which is incompatible with the
regulations of the host country and contradicts with diplomatic
activity.''
   It said that the U.S. thanked the Syrian government for their
handling of the incident in a reply delivered on Friday, but failed
to provide the required explanations.
   The ministry statement also reiterated the Syrian position of
denouncing terrorism but making a distinction between terrorism and
legitimate freedom-fighting against occupying forces.
   The statement said Ms. Beck's charges against the guerrillas was
damaging to the Palestinian people's right to fight for
self-determination.

   East German border guards opened fire as three
people tried to escape from the communist sector to West Berlin on
Friday, apparently wounding one person and arresting the two others,
police said.
   West Berlin police said the East German guards were seen carrying
away one bleeding person after firing several shots Friday afternoon
at the three who tried to reach the wall. The two others were also
captured by the guards but it was not known if they were hit by the
shots.
   Police said the escape attempt in the Spandau district was foiled
while the three were still on a strip of land between the first line
of East German border barriers and the wall.
   Police could not give any other details.
   Communist guards shot and killed a 22-year-old East German man
Feb. 6 as he tried to scale the Berlin Wall with a ladder.
   A 32-year-old East German man fell to his death from a homemade
hot air balloon after flying over the Berlin Wall on Wednesday. West
Berlin police said the man fell from a considerable height and that
there was no evidence the balloon might have been shot down by East
German guards.
   U.S. military mission spokesman Anthony Sariti, speaking for all
three Western Allies in West Berlin, called on East Germany to tear
down the wall.

   Gale-force wind and strong waves pounded Florida's northern coast
on Friday, but sunny skies brought record high temperatures and mild
weather to much of the nation.
   Scattered rain Friday fell in the Pacific Northwest.
   A flood warning was posted for the John Day River at Service
Creek, Ore., because warm temperatures had caused a rapid melting of
the snow. Similar flood warnings were posted in Montana.
   An ice jam caused minor lowland flooding at Wilson, Neb., and
several county roads were closed by flooding in Dodge County, Neb.
   Temperatures were unseasonably warm from much of the Mississippi
Valley across the Rockies and the Plateau.
   Several cities set high temperature records for the date,
including Amarillo, Texas, with 86 degrees; Colorado Springs, Colo.,
with 75; Goodland, Kan., with 82; and Pueblo, Colo., with 83.
   The low temperature for the nation Friday was 1 degree above zero
at Houlton, Maine.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 29
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 90 degrees at Gage, Okla.
   Several beachfront homes were flooded in Fernandina Beach, Fla.,
as high tide rose 2 feet above normal. Authorities closed some
coastal roads and chased thousands of people from the sand at
Daytona Beach.
   Saturday's forecast called for rain over eastern upper Michigan,
from western Montana across the Northern Plateau and the northern
two-thirds of the Pacific Coast.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 30s and 40s from New
England across inland New York state, the Great Lakes, Minnesota,
North Dakota and northeast Montana; in the 50s and 60s from
southeast New York state across northern Florida, over the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys, from eastern Missouri across Iowa and the
northern Plains, the Rockies, northern Plateau, Great Basin and the
northern Pacific coast; in the 80s from much of Texas across inland
Southern California; in the 90s over the desert Southwest; in the
70s over the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Rebels Back Election Boycott With Traffic Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels said Friday they
will begin a traffic ban before the March 19 presidential elections,
which they are boycotting.
   Closing the highways has been a favorite rebel tactic in the
9-year-old civil war. The bans virtually paralyze vehicle traffic,
the principal means of transportation in this Central American
nation, and the rebels enforce them by shooting up or firebombing
trucks, cars or buses found on the roads.
   Venceremos, the clandestine rebel radio, said the ban would start
at midnight Wednesday and continue until further notice.
   It said the purpose was to reinforce ``public sentiment against
the March 19 election.''
   Five traffic bans were declared last year, including one to
support a boycott of legislative and municipal elections. Army
trucks with soldiers riding shotgun were used in some areas to take
people to the polls.
   The rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance won a majority in
the national legislature in the elections last March and its
candidate, businessman and coffee grower Alfredo Christiani, is
favored to win this one.
   Christiani is running against Christian Democratic candidate
Fidel Chavez, a lawyer and former foreign minister, and Guillermo
Ungo of the Democratic Convergence, a coalition of non-combatant
leftist groups.
   A few hours before the traffic ban was announced, President Jose
Napoleon Duarte blamed the rebel Faribundo Marti National Liberation
Front for a delay in negotiations to end the war.
   Duarte's Christian Democratic administration rejected a Jan. 24
proposal by the rebels to begin talks if the election was postponed
until at least September and their conditions for security and a
clean vote were met.
   He accused the guerrillas of ``rejecting dialogue'' and resorting
to ``delay and deceit.''
   ``Their strategy is to create conditions that will gain them
points internationally and nationally, with proposals of peace that
they do not want to honor,'' he said.

   Q. Congressman _
   Q. Mr. President, can you give us the timetable for how you
reached this decision? When did you first start assembling the short
list? How long was the short list? And you've taken so many people
from the Ford administration, do you have any role for former
President Ford? (Laughter.)

advice from him.
   In terms of how long, I moved fast on this one.
   I was telling you the truth when I said, ``I have not considered
anybody else during the last days of the Senate debate.''
   I wasn't about to shift gears or send a signal that wasn't true,
that I was interested in anything _ interested in anything other
than the confirmation of John Tower.
   That's history.
   That's done.
   So when it became clear yesterday that the votes weren't there _
yesterday _ I began to think and talk to our _ my top advisers here,
get opinions from them.
   They reached out a little bit, and then I called Dick today and
he came over and visited with me, about 1 I think it was.
   And I said I want to make a decision fast on this, because I know
him well and have known him over the years well.
   And so it _ that's about the way it evolved.
   Yes, Gerry?
   Q. Mr. President, have you _
   Bush: He got _ he wants a follow-up. (Laughter.)
   Cheney: If I may, John, the _ I was first contacted late
yesterday afternoon by General Scowcroft and Governor Sununu.
   We had a discussion at that point that initiated my consideration
of it, and I just discussed it with the president today.
   Q. Mr. Secretary _
   Q. Did you _
   Bush: Gerry?
   Q. Mr. President, have you talked about this selection yet with
Senator Nunn and Senator Mitchell? If so, can you describe their
reaction a little bit? And did you get any kind of a commitment
about the timing of confirmation hearings?
   Bush: Gerry, what we did on that was divide up here just recently
the names to talk to, and I believe General Scowcroft talked to
Senator Mitchell and to Senator Nunn.
   And I would let them characterize their reaction to it.
   But _ and I've talked to the speaker.
   The only one of the kind of hierarchy that we haven't reached is
Bob Michel, and it's very important that he be notified, but I
expect he will be by all of this.
   But nevertheless, we divided it up, and the reaction from the
people that we've contacted, the understandable one, has been very,
very positive.
   Q. Mr. President _
   Bush: Yes?
   Q. Do you have a hearing schedule?
   Bush: Oh, I don't know.
   John, did you talk about timing?
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu: I asked Senator Mitchell
to evaluate how quickly it could be done, and we will talk again in
the next day or two about what kind of a schedule they can deal with.
   Bush: Yes, and we've started the clearances, name check has been
completed, rapid-fire time, and Dick has undergone two thorough
full-field checks and he's had _ has there been another one since
those?
   (Inaudible.)
   Bush: Yes, and the preliminary check today.
   So I think that will go very well.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, can I ask more about the Quayle speech. He is
out in Indianapolis this afternoon, accusing Senate Democrats of
using McCarthy-like tactics in the defeat of John Tower. With
respect to your comments about putting the Tower nomination behind
you, would you tell us if Mr. Quayle speaks for you?
   Bush: I haven't seen what he said so I can't tell you whether he
speaks for me.
   I speak for myself.
   He speaks for himself.
   But I explained why that _ he feels strongly about it.
   I feel strongly about it, and I am determined to move forward.
   And I think that this nomination will set that tone and we'll see
how we go from here.

<HEAD>New Banning Threat Arouses Protests by City, Latin Groups</HEAD>

   A threat to ban a fourth singer slated to perform in
this weekend's Calle Ocho festival drew protests Friday from city
officials and Latin groups who say the organizers' anti-Castro
policy has gone too far.
   City Manager Cesar Odio froze a $15,000 city subsidy to the
Little Havana Kiwanis Club, which sponsors the event, on grounds the
group may have violated its contract barring political or religious
activities in the festival.
   Dade County authorities also held up another $15,000 payment
aimed at helping to market the gigantic street party, slated to be
held Sunday.
   ``Calle Ocho is a Mardi Gras of all cultures of Spanish-speaking
background,'' said Yvette Morgan of the National Conference of
Puerto Rican Women, one of the critics of the ban. ``It has always
been for all Hispanic arts, not just for the anti-communists.''
   About 40 Puerto Rican men and women picketed outside the Kiwanis
Club offices Friday in the Little Havana neighborhood, chanting and
carrying signs saying ``This is the United States'' and ``Pepsi-Cola
is in Russia, why not Montanez in Calle Ocho?'', referring to one of
the banned performers, Puerto Rican singer Andy Montanez.
   Kiwanis leaders insisted again Friday they will not back down
from their strict rule barring anyone who has performed in Cuba
since Fidel Castro's revolution. They said the last-minute freeze of
government subsidies should not seriously affect the festitval.
   ``Our policy has to stay for this year,'' insisted Kiwanis
President Pedro Menendez. ``It's too late to change it.''
   However, he emphasized that the Kiwanis had not deliberately
picked a fight over the issue, and were simply trying not to offend
the city's large anti-communist Cuban community.
   ``This has definitely gone too far,'' Menendez said. ``Our
original intention was not to insult certain segments of our
community, and apparently, by trying to do that, we have insulted
other people.''
   Three Latin singers _ Montanez; Brazilian Denise de Kalafe; and
Spain's De Raymond _ have been banned already this year by the
Kiwanis because they made appearances in Cuba as long as 20 years
ago.
   And on Friday, Menendez said they might also exclude famed
merengue singer Wilfrido Vargas of the Dominican Republic, who is
credited as performing on a record album made in Cuba a decade ago.
Menendez said Kiwanis officials were checking to confirm that he was
really there.
   All the singers have strongly condemned Castro's government.
   The Miami Herald withdrew its sponsorship of Calle Ocho after De
Raymond _ scheduled to sing with the duo Los Espanolisimos on a
newspaper-sponsored stage _ was dropped because of a 1978 appearance
in Cuba.
   De Raymond said the ban was particularly painful for him because
he was barred from Spain's Socialist-run television for six years
because of his strong anti-communist views. ``I deserve a tribute,
not a ban,'' De Raymond said.
   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez has also condemned the bans.
   ``The position the Kiwanis have taken is really hurting them and
the city,'' Suarez said. ``It is a very extreme position for them to
take _ one I don't think too many people agree with, even in the
Cuban community.''
   Some in the Cuban community support the tough stand, however,
saying the performers had insulted the exiles here, who consider
themselves refugees of an autocratic regime.
   ``I can't see people having festivals in Miami Beach and inviting
people who performed for Hitler,'' said state Rep. Lincoln
Diaz-Balart.
   Calle Ocho _ which means Eighth Street in Spanish, named for the
main thoroughfare of Little Havana where it takes place _ has become
the nation's largest Latin festival in only 10 years. It attracts a
million people as well as top entertainment from around Latin
America.

   A chase that never exceeded 20 mph ended
in death for a 25-year-old man when his car collided head-on with an
18-wheel truck Thursday, police said.
   An officer began pursuing Eddie Lynn Spencer of Kilgore when he
was spotted driving erratically about 3 a.m. on Interstate 20,
police said.
   Forest Hill officer Clint Turner told investigators he saw the
car stop three times, and that it never went faster than 20 mph, but
when he tried to pull it over, the driver kept going and began
weaving.
   The suspect finally pulled over, but the car bolted when Turner
approached, police said.
   Spencer made a U-turn to go west in an eastbound lane and after
800 yards he collided with the truck. The truck driver was uninjured
and not charged, police said.
   Police said an autopsy would determine if alcohol contributed to
the crash.

<HEAD>EDS: New with Nunn saying ``no impediment'' to nomination, Mitchell
comment, Cheney position as No. 2 in House GOP leadership. Edits to tighten.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Friday named Rep. Richard
Cheney of Wyoming as defense secretary, moving with surprising speed
to leave behind the controversy caused by John Tower's rejection by
the Senate.
   Bush said he would order the FBI to speed up its background
checks to get the nomination moving. ```Too much time has been
wasted here,'' he said.
   The president won a pledge of quick action from leaders of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, who praised Cheney and said
confirmation hearings would begin next week.
   ``I know of no impediment to his nomination,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services chairman who led the successful
battle to kill Tower's nomination.
   Cheney, 48, is a six-term conservative congressman who served as
White House chief of staff during the Ford administration. His
selection was a surprise in view of his relative lack of experience
on defense issues.
   Appearing with Bush at a hurriedly called news conference, Cheney
said he had an ``active interest'' in defense matters but
acknowledged that ``obviously there are areas that I need to know
and I'll have to work hard on to master.''
   In naming Cheney, Bush picked the No. 2 man in the House GOP
leadership, depleting his party's minority ranks there after a
post-campaign pledge not to choose anyone from Capitol Hill for his
Cabinet.
   ``This is the exception that proves that rule,'' Bush said when
asked about his earlier declaration.
   And Cheney said ``I did agonize'' over leaving the Hill, where he
has often said he enjoyed his work.
   Bush, brushing aside the divisive battle over Tower, said,
``That's history. That's done.'' However, Vice President Dan Quayle
reignited the furor by accusing Democrats of engaging in ``a
McCarthyite mud-slinging campaign'' against Tower and waging an
``assault on the powers of the presidency.''
   Commenting on Quayle's remarks, Bush said, ``I can't tell you if
he speaks for me. I speak for myself. He speaks for himself.''
   Tower's nomination was killed Thursday on a near party line vote
of 53-47 in the Democratic-controlled Senate. He was defeated by
concerns over his drinking habits, his relationships with women and
his work as a paid defense industry consultant after leaving
government service.
   Bush praised Cheney as a ``widely respected man of principle''
and predicted his nomination would ``go very fast'' and ``have
smooth sailing.''
   Democrats and Republicans alike saluted the selection.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole quickly hailed the appointment
in a barbed comment that reflected the bitterness lingering from the
Tower confirmation struggle.
   ``He's tough. That's what we wanted. A tough, tough, tough guy,''
he said of Cheney. ``This time it will be a confirmation, not an
execution.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine said Cheney had
``served with distinction'' in Congress. He promised to work with
Nunn to ensure the nomination gets ``prompt consideration'' by the
committee and the full Senate.
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., said, ``He's a very able and impressive
person. ... He's one of the smartest people in Congress.''
   ``An excellent choice,'' said Sen. Charles Robb, the freshman
from Virginia who was one of the last Democrats to announce his
opposition to Tower.
   In a joint statement, Nunn and Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the
ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said Cheney ``is
well known and highly respected by the members of the Senate. We
have worked with him on many issues involving national defense and
intelligence matters.''
   Almost immediately after Tower's defeat, the White House turned
to Cheney.
   The congressman said he was contacted late Thursday afternoon by
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu and national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft. Then, at 1 p.m. Friday, Cheney went to the White
House and discussed the job with Bush.
   ``I said I want to make a decision fast on this, because I know
him well and have known him well over the years,'' the president
said.
   Cheney said he checked with his cardiologist before accepting the
job and was assured there were no medical restrictions to stop him.
A heart attack victim, Cheney underwent bypass surgery last August,
but returned to work three weeks later, he said.
   Looking back at the handling of Tower's nomination, Bush said,
``I may have made a mistake'' by holding it back pending FBI checks
of allegations against Tower. ``There may have been some other
tactical things that went wrong, but please remember that when the
nomination went up there, it was very well received generally.''
   In response to reporters' questions on Star Wars and a series of
other defense issues, Cheney said, ``I have extensive views on
defense policy but I don't believe I'll share them today.''
   Bush was asked about his past declarations that Tower was the
best qualified candidate to head the Pentagon.
   ``I said that on December whatever it was and now we're in March
whatever it is. And as of today Dick Cheney is the best and proper
choice,'' the president said in an appearance before reporters
shortly after his departure for a weekend at Camp David.
   Many potential candidates had been mentioned for the job,
including former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala., Sens. William Cohen,
R-Maine and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, former defense secretaries Donald
Rumsfeld and James Schlesinger, former CIA deputy director Bobby
Inman, Paul O'Neill, chairman and chief executive officer of Alcoa,
and Norman Augustine, chairman and chief executive officer of Martin
Marietta Aerospace Corp.
   Fitzwater, at a late-morning briefing, said Bush reviewed
candidates from ``any number of people and sources in the
government, in the White House and outside the government as well.''
   Meanwhile, Quayle flew to Indianapolis and, in a speech, harshly
criticized Senate Democrats and warned there will be a lingering
bitterness over the Tower fight.
   ``Never in all my years in the Senate have I encountered anything
like the feeling of outrage that exists today among my former
Republican Senate colleagues,'' he said. ``Never have I encountered
such anger and bitterness in the Senate chamber.''
   Quayle said ``the harmful consequences of the Tower affair will
not soon pass. I'm afraid that the misguided Democratic assault on
the powers of the presidency will continue.''
   At the White House, Fitzwater said Quayle had given a copy of the
speech to the White House on Thursday but that he did not have to
have his remarks cleared in advance.

   President Bush served up the last question at
his news conference on Friday with a lecture to outspoken reporter
Sarah McClendon that ``the loudest voice won't always be
recognized.''
   But the feisty Texas newswoman, who has covered 10 presidents,
had the last laugh: her question wasn't for Bush but for Defense
Secretary-designate Richard Cheney.
   ``I wanted to ask you new man what he feels...,'' she began.
   Ms. McClendon, a fixture at White House news conferences since
1944, was seeking to get the president's attention in her usual way
_ by calling out robustly for recognition.
   At first ignoring her calls, Bush wound up the news conference _
called to announce his choice of Cheney _ by recognizing her.
   But, at the same time, he told her: ``I will make a new
announcement of press policy, Sarah. The squeaking wheel will not
always get the grease in life, and the loudest voice won't always
get recognized.''
   ``You and I have known each a long time and so this is the last
time that I can succumb to the tendency to go to the loudest or most
frantic wave. I can't do it and it's not fair to calmer souls.''
   Ms. McClendon, who operates her own Texas news service, said
afterwards that she has known Bush a long time and took no offense
from his remarks, which she called ``just a bunch of gaff.''
   ``It doesn't bother me at all. I have a right to get in my
questions just as everyone else. We don't all have a seat in the
front row,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Workers began a sit-in strike at Warsaw's
main post Friday in a spreading pay dispute by postal employees that
has made it difficult to pay bills, collect pensions and conduct
other business.
   The first Warsaw post office closed Tuesday, and by Thursday 38
of the 242 branches were on strike, according to official reports.
   Post offices also were closed in the southern cities of Krakow
and Radom, where an official report said workers at 10 post offices
were refusing to handle mail not labeled emergency.
   Strikers are seeking wage increases and changes in working
conditions at the offices, which provide a wide range of services
including collecting rent and utility and insurance payments.
   Workers seek monthly raises averaging 30,000 to 35,000 zlotys _
$54 to $63 at the official exchange rate _ according to Zuzanna
Dabrowska of the banned Polish Socialist Party.
   She put the average postal employee's monthly salary at 32,000
zlotys, or $57. The state PAP news agency said pay raises last year
made the average mail carrier's salary 55,000 zlotys, or $99, and
the average cashier's monthly salary 66,000 zlotys _ $118.
   Mail carriers also are demanding that they not be required to
deliver weekly newspapers and magazines, except perhaps to disabled
people, and are disputing pension and benefit payments.
   PAP quoted the management of Warsaw's main post office as saying,
``The possibility of pay increases here, like in all other
enterprises, are directly dependent on economic effects.''
   Banners announcing the strike covered the entrance doors at the
main post office.
   The banners did not indicate if the strikers were affiliated with
the outlawed Solidarity union movement or the government-sanctioned
OPZZ union.
   Ms. Dabrowska said strike committee members were not associated
with either group and the sit-in would continue at the main post
office at least until Monday.
   Poland has had labor disputes since the beginning of the year,
with workers trying to cope with inflation that exceeded more than
60 percent last year. Government officials hope to reduce that to 50
percent this year.
   A strike entered its 11th day at the Poltex J. Marchlewski cotton
mill in Lodz, and bankers told managers the plant is facing
insolvency.
   PAP said mill workers voted to continue the strike after a
discussion. It quoted a strike committee member as saying, ``The
financial situation of the factory is bad. The workers do not feel
responsible for that.'' He blamed taxes, management and financial
regulations.
   Industry Minister Mieczlyslaw Wilczek is considering liquidating
the plant, PAP said.

   Q. Mr. President _
   Q. Mr. President _
   Bush: Yes _
   Q. One of the things that Senator Tower did in this period was
work up a strategy, which apparently you approved of, which was that
the _ you would squeeze the defense budget down into the limits set
by the Congress, if the Congress would let you make some or all of
the choices. Is this strategy going to be passed along to Dick
Cheney? And, do you plan to pursue a similar strategy?
   Bush: I'm going to have to defer answering that, because, though
we talked about budget generally and making tough choices generally,
we didn't go into that much detail yet, and I think he's entitled to
giving me his views on it before we do.
   Jerry?
   Q. Mr. President _
   Q. Mr. President, have you asked the congressman the obvious
question: Is there anything in his background that would be
prohibitive or embarrassing, or anything like that? How much _
   Bush: Yes.
   Q. _ detail have you gone into?

   Please.
   Q. Oh, I'm sorry. You got me so flustered, I forgot my question.
(Laughter.)
   Bush: I'll come back.
   That's not fair.
   Here.
   Q. Mr. President _
   Q. Mr. President, if we could go back to Mr. Quayle just for a
second. I'm not sure that the American public really understands the
difference between speaking for himself and speaking for you, since
he is your vice president. And he is out in Indianapolis, has used
the words ``McCarthy-type tactics,'' and yet you're here wanting to
have things go smoothly for the congressman. I'm just wondering how
you can square your desire to have peace with the Congress and what
your vice president is saying Indianapolis.
   Bush: Please don't ask me to comment on something I haven't read.
   That's what I'd say to that one.
   Yes _
   Q. Mr. President _
   Q. A question for Congressman Cheney about defense policy. Does
he have a view on the Strategic Defense Initiative? Does he believe
it's _ America can erect a perfect defense or something more modest?
   Cheney: I have extensive views on defense policy, but I don't
believe I'll share those today.
   It seems to me it's appropriate for me to discuss those matters
before the Senate committee during the confirmation process and not
in this forum.
   Bush: Now, back _ I'm sorry _ I _
   Q. Mr. President _
   Bush: Excuse me, go ahead.
   Q. Sir, there's been an incredible amount of analysis about what
happened to the Tower nomination, as you're aware. And I think we've
all heard your views about the Senate. But I'm particularly
interested in is whether you feel that your administration bears any
responsibility whatsoever in the fact that Tower did not get
confirmed?

<HEAD>Official: State Can Give Only Limited Aid For Stricken Peasants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Food shortages in several Vietnamese
provinces have forced some peasants to eat roots and sell farming
utensils to buy grain but the government can provide only limited
aid, according to an official.
   The shortages resulted from severe weather conditions that
destroyed crops last year and are expected to last until the next
harvest in May and June.
   Agriculture Minister Nguyen Cong Tan said that even in normal
conditions about 10 percent of Vietnam's peasant families experience
food shortages annually, including those in the Mekong River Delta
in the south that is the country's most productive area.
   Tan's comments came in an interview the official Vietnamese army
newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan published last month. A translation was
seen Friday in Bangkok.
   Tan reported shortages in the northern and central provinces of
Lang Son, Thanh Hoa, Nghe Tinh, Binh Tri Tien, Quang Nam-Danang and
Gia Lai-Cong Tum, and in areas east of Nam Bo and the Mekong River
Delta in the south. Vietnamese radio reported earlier this month
that hundreds of thousands of rural families in Nghe Tinh, where
floods had hit, ``have run out of food grain.''
   Tan said 90 percent of the peasants in the Ky Anh district of
Nghe Tinh were short of food and some ``had to sell their utensils
and private property to buy grain; others had to dig roots in the
forest to eat.''
   He said Ky Anh has lost five consecutive crops since 1986 and its
per capita output of grain was only about 70 pounds last year.
   Vietnamese officials said total national grain production was 19
million metric tons last year, an increase over the previous year,
but the country is still losing the struggle to feed a fast-growing
population of more than 63 million.

<HEAD>Order Tougher Emission Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, trying to head off an
increasingly severe urban smog problem this summer, ordered tougher
hydrocarbon emission standards for gasoline Friday, but the federal
action is not as tough as some states would like.
   The Environmental Protection Agency announced that for the first
time, gasoline will have to meet nationwide volatility levels. These
levels, which are controlled during the blending process, determine
how easily gasoline evaporates and, in turn, how much hydrocarbon
pollutants get into the air.
   Hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides are key ingredient of ozone and
urban smog.
   Under the EPA requirements, gasoline volatility may be no greater
than 10.5 pounds per inch in most parts of the country this summer.
In some states, especially during the hottest months, the standard
is somewhat tougher.
   The EPA action is the first time the federal government has told
the petroleum industry it had to curb volatility to a specific level
on nationwide basis. There have been local limits in southern
California since the early 1970s.
   The EPA estimated the federal requirement, which sets a 10.5 psi
gasoline volatility level or lower in every state, would mean a 13
percent reduction of hydrocarbon emissions into the air. Gasoline
volatility generally has been at at a level of 11.5 psi.
   But the EPA said that level causes a release of gasoline vapors
``beyond the capacity of existing vehicle-emission controls'' to
handle. As a result, vapors are released into the air from auto fuel
systems as well as while gasoline is transferred from one storage
area to another or while vehicles are being fueled, officials said.
   ``Most of our major urban areas suffer from unhealthful summer
smog levels,'' said EPA Administrator William K. Reilly in a
statement. ``The standards set today will help reduce this harmful
pollutant.''
   The country had the worst urban smog problem in recent years last
summer with nationwide ozone levels higher than anytime in this
decade and 14 percent greater than the year before. Federal maximum
ozone levels were exceeded 60 percent more often last summer than in
1983, the worst previous year.
   But a group of northeastern states have pushed for even tougher
restrictions and officials in those states have expressed concerns
that their state requirements _ which would limit gasoline
volatility to 9 psi this summer _ might be scuttled by the federal
regulation.
   By law, federal emission rules normally would pre-empt local
requirements unless specific waivers are provided, EPA officials
said. The EPA said last month it plans to grant a waiver to
Massachusetts, but the agency has not acted on waiver requests from
the other six states states.
   The tougher gasoline volatility standards enacted for this summer
are to go into effect May 1 in Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Vermont and Maine unless
preempted by the federal regulation.
   The tougher state standards have been strongly opposed by the
petroleum industry. The American Petroleum Institute has filed suit
in New York seeking to prevent that state's tougher restrictions
from going into effect. It argues the state requirements _ which
establish a maximum 9 psi volatility level for gasoline sold between
May 1 and Sept. 15 _ could cause driving problems and problems in
gasoline distribution.
   But supporters of the more stringent requirements deny that the
lower volatility levels adversely affect gasoline performance. They
maintain the oil companies' opposition to the tighter standards stem
from the fact the gasoline with the lower volatility is more
expensive to produce.
   ``The Northeast is faced with a sever ozone problem (in the
summer months). We have two choices. We can either reduce emissions
that contribute to ozone formation or we can continue to ask people
to restrict their activity during ozone episodes,'' said Michael
Bradley, executive director of a coalition of state enviornmental
officials formed to implement the tougher requirements in the seven
northeastern states.

   Prominent Lebanese international banker
Roger Tamraz reappeared Friday and denied reports he was kidnapped
and held for ransom by a militia leader who lost money when his bank
went under.
   Earlier Friday, however, a Tamraz business associate told The
Associated Press in Nicosia, Cyprus that the banker was freed after
arranging to pay the final installment of a $3 million ransom.
   Tamraz, 48, checked into the seaside west Beirut Summerland Hotel
shortly before sunset.
   ``I was not kidnapped,'' he said in an interview with The
Associated Press. ``I was on my own doing my own thinking.''
   Tamraz, who was reported kidnapped Feb. 19, said the ransom
report was ``based on rumor and figment of the imagination, and
there's nothing to it.''
   The Christian-controlled radio station, Voice of Lebanon, said
Thursday that Tamraz was being held by Elie Hobeika, commander of a
Christian militia in the eastern Bekaa valley town of Zahle.
   The report said that Hobeika, a former commander of the Lebanese
Forces, the main Christian militia, was forcing Tamraz to pay $3
million he claimed was owed him after the collapse of Bank
Al-Mashrek, Lebanon's second-largest bank.
   Tamraz, who is a United States resident, headed the Christian-run
bank until December, when a run on its assets began. An arrest
warrant was issued for Tamraz pending investigation of the bank's
affairs.
   The respected newsletter, Middle East Economic Survey, estimated
Al-Mashrek's deficit in Lebanon at $100 million. A largely
state-owned conglomerate owned a major share in the bank.
   Tamraz fled from Christian east Beirut to the Moslem-held western
part of the capital in January and lived in the Summerland hotel
until shortly before his disappearance. Since last fall, Lebanon has
had two rival governments, one Christian and one Moslem.
   The Tamraz associate, who spoke by telephone from Paris and
declined to be identified, said a ``loan instrument'' was fixed to
transfer the final $750,000 in ransom money to the kidnappers
through a Swiss bank.
   He said Tamraz' release was delayed for two days while the loan
was arranged.
   Hobeika is held responsible for the September 1982 massacre of
hundreds of Palestinian civilians by Christian militiamen in two
Beirut refugee camps after Israel invaded Lebanon. The charge was
confirmed by Israeli reports but denied by Hobeika.
   In his interview Friday, Tamraz predicted he would be vindicated
of charges in connection with the bank's demise. Investigators say
the bank, under his direction, made shaky investments in Spanish
real estate and a money-losing cargo airline. It also took over
three ailing banks and assumed their deficits.
   In the past Tamraz, a Maronite Catholic, blamed Lebanese central
bank governor Edmond Naim for deliberately undermining the bank in
order to get rid of him.

   Two men were cut down by gunfire
as they left a busy tavern Friday night in mainly Roman Catholic
west Belfast, and one died in a hospital, police reported.
   Witnesses said two gunmen stepped from an automobile across the
street from the Orient Bar, fired several shots and sped off in the
car.
   They said Protestants and Catholics frequent the pub. There was
no immediate claim of responsibility.
   Also in west Belfast, an elderly man was shot in the arm in a
garage on the Falls Road, a predominantly Catholic area, and taken
to a hospital, a police spokesman said.
   Five other people have been killed in Northern Ireland this week.
The death toll is at least 2,730 in the 20 years since the Irish
Republican Army began fighting to end British rule in Northern
Ireland.
   Two British soldiers were killed Wednesday night when a mine
containing 400 pounds of explosives blew up their armored jeep near
Londonderry. Six other soldiers in the two-vehicle patrol were
wounded.
   Two innocent men were killed by IRA gunmen Tuesday, in a case of
mistaken identity, while they chatted with friends at a gas station
in Coagh village, County Tyrone.

   Bush: I have read that we made mistakes.
   I don't _ I think _ and if so, I would be _ you know _ glad to
say so.
   But I don't know exactly _ I can't think of a specific that we
might have done differently in this circumstance.
   You have to remember, one of the allegations was I took too long
to send it up.
   But what we were trying to do was the same thing that overtook
events once it got to the hill _ gunning down groundless rumors.
   So I _ you know, that's what took the time to begin with.
   Every time we'd get ready to go up with the nomination, which I
felt was a good one, there'd be some other allegation printed out
there _ not by the Senate, but just floating out there.
   And we'd have to say, ``What is this? Please send the
investigators to Geneva to see if indeed the East'' _ not East Texas
here _ ``the East German spy was true,'' you know.
   And then we'd find it wasn't true.
   Then we'd be ready and there'd be some other allegation.
   And that's the way _ so maybe I made a mistake in not just going
ahead.
   But what I wanted to do, and told our general counsel is, ``Look,
I think we have an obligation to have the FBI look at these.''
   I think that may _ and I would have to bear full responsibility
for that _ maybe set a tone up there that then encouraged, you know,
leaks, counterleaks, and investigation of rumor and innuendo.
   So I'd have to accept some responsibility for that, I think.
   And there may have been some other tactical things that went
wrong.
   But please remember that when that nomination went up there it
was very well received generally.
   And, indeed, Senator Nunn, I think, said on the floor that he was
_ you know _ had been fully prepared to vote for it.
   So, I don't know, but in that area, I think there might _ I may
have made a _ made a mistake.
   Q. Mr. President?
   Q. Can I just follow up?
   Bush: She has a follow-up. Yes?
   Q. Some of the things that have been analyzed have centered on
the fact that it takes any new White House staff some time to get
its act together, and that this crisis came at one of the worst
times it could have come for you in terms of having the same kind of
weak and inexperienced staff that any president would have at this
stage of the game. And we've all read things about some of the
senators weren't contacted, and that you did not really go all out
in terms of twisting arms; you sort of appealed to fairness. Is
there anything along this line that you think might have worked
differently?
   Bush: I don't think I'd do it differently to do over again.
   And I don't _ I certainly am not going to fault my staff.
   I think this was historic in the _ and I'm not, you know _ I
don't think the time is appropriate to start trying to assess blame.
   I mean, I think there'll be a lot of aftermaths in what happened,
but we're going to go forward.
   And I frankly feel that I've given you a long list of things that
make me feel the administration is moving forward appropriately.
   We're moving swiftly on this nomination.
   And I'm one who has a rather broad perspective of how things are
in Washington.
   And tomorrow it'll be some other problem.
   And we will _ I will work with the Congress.
   And I think I will continue to keep this feeling that I can work
with the Congress.

<HEAD>Miners' Strike Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethnic Albanian miners on Friday
stayed away from their jobs for a second day to protest the
treatment of ethnic Albanian leaders in troubled Kosovo province,
the state Tanjug news agency said.
   Elez Zeinalihi, director of the mine, told The Associated Press
in a telephone interview that he and local party leaders talked to
about 120 miners for two hours Friday morning and tried to persuade
them to resume work.
   ``They even refused to talk to us,'' Zeinalihi said about the
strikers. ``I don't know what will happen now.''
   Zeinalihi said the miners, who began their strike Thursday, were
protesting what they described as the ``hounding of (some ethnic)
Albanian leaders'' by police, and demanded an explanation of why
Azem Vlasi, a former Communist Party leader of Kosovo, and two other
officials were recently arrested.
   The 400 miners of three shifts at the mine about 140 miles south
of Belgrade were visited Thursday by Kosovo's Premier Nazmi Mustafa,
who urged them to deal with their grievances through legal means,
Tanjug said.
   ``Do not complicate the already serious situation,'' he
reportedly warned the miners.
   Miners of two pits at the Trepca lead and zinc mines also stopped
work Friday morning for an hour, Tanjug reported.
   Last month, about 1,300 ethnic Albanian miners staged an
eight-day sit-in at the Trepca mines, demanding that no changes be
made in Yugoslavia's 1974 constitution, which granted Kosovo
wide-ranging autonomy. The miners also demanded the resignations of
three senior Communist Party officials.
   The action, which brought Kosovo to the verge of a general
strike, prompted federal authorities to impose emergency measures in
the region and led to the arrest of Vlasi, two directors of the
Trepca mines and several other people accused of sedition.
   The strike ended after the three party officials, who are
generally believed to be supporters of Serbia's party chief Slobodan
Milosevic, bowed to the strikers' demands and handed in their
resignations.
   Since then, however, Serbian govermnment officials and the
republic's partisan press have been demanding that the resignations
be withdrawn and the strikers punished.
   Milosevic has been pressing for constitutional changes that would
introduce more Serbian control over the affairs of Kosovo in an
effort to provide more security for the Slav minority, which claims
persecution by the majority ethnic Albanians.

   Tibetans and Chinese news reports painted
radically different pictures of how the remote region, after a week
of riot and martial law, marked the 30th anniversary Friday of a
fruitless uprising against China.
   State TV said more than 30 Tibetan ``rioters'' surrendered to
police and admitted to taking part in disturbances this week in
Lhasa, the capital.
   It said Tibetans peacefully ``celebrated the 30th anniversary of
democratic reforms in Tibet.''
   Tibetans reached by telephone Thursday and Friday spoke of
large-scale roundups and pervasive fear in the city of 70,000.
   One woman said arrests began soon after the last Western tourists
were expelled from the city. Tourists were ordered out when martial
law was imposed at midnight Tuesday, and the last planeload of
foreigners left Friday.
   Protests and riots cost 16 lives by official count, but Western
travelers say most Tibetans put the death toll at 20 to 30.
   A group of five men _ an American and four Swedes _ arrived in
the Nepalese capital of Katmandu Friday night and said they were
happy to be out of Lhasa. They left Lhasa Tuesday morning and were
the first batch of foreigners to reach Nepal.
   ``I feel very lucky to get my passport back from the Chinese and
make my journey safely to Katmandu,'' Russell Liebman, 22, of New
York City, told The Associated Press there.
   A 22-year-old Swede from Uppsala, who identied himself only as
Pontus, said they had reserved a vehicle and ``we had a 2{-day ride
... along the Tibetan plateau. But after reaching Nyalam, we had to
walk rest of the day through the snowfields to reach Zangmu, the
last Tibetan township situated near the border (with Nepal).''
   Liebman said, ``I still feel dazed after witnessing the warlike
scenes. ... We saw three bodies of the people killed in actual
shooting near our place.''
   Liebman said they took many photographs, but police confiscated
the film when they ran back to their hotel after shooting broke out.
   China's nightly news said martial law stopped a riot planned for
Friday in Lhasa.
   New martial law orders issued Thursday demanded the immediate
surrender of anyone who planned, instigated or participated in the
riots or was harboring criminals or hiding looted goods.
   The official press, in reports on government officials returning
to work and Tibetans bringing food and blankets to Chinese soldiers,
depicted Tibetans as supporting the crackdown.
   ``A veteran Tibetan worker took a bottle of yak-butter tea to
police,'' said the official Xinhua News Agency. When an officer
refused because of military regulations, ``the old man insisted that
the policeman at least come to his home nearby `to get a warmup from
the cold','' the report said.
   Earlier this week, foreign travelers said most Tibetans were
terrified of martial law and the police.
   ``Tibetans told me the night they declared martial law people
were staying up late cleaning their houses of anything that might be
incriminating,'' an American said Friday. ``They were burning
pictures of the Dalai Lama,'' the exiled spiritual leader who fled
to India after the uprising in 1959.
   During the riots, Tibetans demanding independence and chanting
loyalty to the Dalai Lama threw stones, ransacked Chinese-owned
shops, set fire to Chinese property and attacked government
buildings.
   On Friday, the Dalai Lama urged Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to
end the violence in Lhasa and begin talk on a peaceful solution.
   In an interview with the BBC, he said negotiations with the
Chinese are ``the only way.''
   In New York, about 200 Tibetans and sympathizers carried a wooden
coffin from U.N. Headquarters to China's U.N. Mission, chanting
slogans and blowing prayer horns.
   For China, the March 10 anniversary marks the beginning of
``democratic reform,'' the institution of communist political and
economic systems in the remote Himalayan region.
   Tibetans remember the day as one when tens of thousands converged
on the Dalai Lama's palace to prevent what they thought was a
Chinese military attempt to kidnap their god-king.
   A week later, the Chinese allegedly fired two mortar shells into
the palace grounds, and the Dalai Lama and his family fled secretly
to India.
   When he was gone, the Chinese army destroyed the Tibetan
resistance, killing hundreds of people, perhaps thousands.
   China says Tibet has been an inalienable part of its territory
for seven centuries. Many Tibetans say their land was independent
for much of that time and they seek a sovereign state under the
Dalai Lama.

   A volcano erupted near here, and another
crater spewed ash and steam in Nicaragua, but officials in the two
Central American countries said Thursday they had no immediate
reports of major damage or injuries.
   Eddy Sanchez, deputy director of Guatemala's Seismological
Institute, said in an interview that 255 residents of two villages
on the slopes of the Pacaya Volcano were forced to evacuate their
homes because of lava flows.
   Pacaya, 16 miles south of the capital, started spewing lava
Tuesday afternoon. About 175 people in the village of El Caracol and
80 from El Patrocinio cleared out of their homes late Wednesday,
hours ahead of a small river of lava that destroyed their
coffee-bean fields.
   But a number of farmers in other villages in the area stayed
behind, Sanchez said. He said the lava is flowing down Pacaya's
slopes in a southeasterly direction at about 15 feet an hour.
   The 8,421-foot peak, one of 32 volcanos dotting Guatemala, has
been erupting intermittently since it first turned active Jan 21,
1987. On Tuesday, the volcano blew open a new crater.
   ``The Pacaya continues active, spewing out lava with constant
explosions,'' Sanchez said.
   In Nicaragua, Santiago volcano, 12 miles southeast of the
capital, Managua, began releasing white gases on Sunday, but
scientists monitoring the activity say there is no immediate danger
of an eruption.
   Santiago is one of three in the Masaya complex, one of the most
active volcanic ranges in Central America. Its single crater has
been releasing gases about once every two decades.
   Lava flows often have followed the initial eruptions, but they
solidified before reaching populated areas.
   Favio Segura, an engineer with the Nicaraguan Institute of
Territorial Studies, told reporters, ``It is difficult to predict if
Santiago will develop a large or small lava flow.''
   He said three Nicaraguan and three British vulcanologists are
monitoring the peak around the clock.
   The National Association of Geologists has reported no
``immediate risk of a violent explosion that would endanger
surrounding communities.''

   Amnesty International on Friday urged the
Venezuelan government to investigate reports of human rights abuses
during last week's riots over price increases and other economic
measures.
   In a telexed message to President Carlos Andres Perez, the
London-based human rights organization said that although security
forces had to confront violent unrest, that did not mitigate concern
about alleged unlawful killings of civilians and beatings of
detainees.
   Rioting and looting broke out across Venezuela Feb. 27 after
public transportation fares were increased as part of a government
auserity program. Government officials said the week of violence
left 256 people dead and thousands injured. Unofficial reports put
the casualty tolls much higher.
   The group said it had reports of people shot in their homes
during police raids. It also said anxiety was growing for the safety
of people unaccounted for since they were taken into custody.
   Amnesty called for the release of detainees held for non-violent
activities.
   The group said the alleged human rights abuses were in line with
patterns that had developed in Venezuela in recent years and which
it had described in a memorandum to the government last August.
   Amnesty International campaigns against capital punishment and
torture and for the release of non-violent political prisoners.

   A blaze authorities say started with a
4-year-old playing with wood in an open heater claimed the life of a
second firefighter Thursday.
   Capt. Jimmy L. Ayers, 46, died at Baptist Medical Center, where
he had been treated for second- and third-degree burns over 80 to 90
percent of his body.
   Sobbing friends and family packed the corridor outside the
third-floor burn unit after the death was announced. Firefighters
wore strips of black across their badges and met with firefighters
and police officers who came from Shreveport, La., to help counsel
them.
   Fire Chief Tom Smith said a memorial service for Ayers and
Jeffrey Lindsey, who died in the fire Wednesday, would be held
Saturday.
   The boy's mother, Dorothy Munker, told neighbors she tried
unsuccessfully to extinguish the fire before fleeing with her son.
Three other children were at school.
   A third burned firefighter, Capt. Bennie D. Zellner, 44, was in
critical condition at Baptist Medical Center.
   Smith said doctors had set the extent of Zellner's burns at 60
percent of his body, down from an earlier estimate of 70 to 80
percent. Smith said Zellner's bodily functions remained strong and
the firefighter had regained some movement in his hands and feet.
   All three firefighters were inside the living room of the house
when gases released from burning material ignited suddenly, a
phenomenon known as a flash over, Smith said.
   The deaths were the first in almost 40 years involving Oklahoma
City firefighters while fighting a fire.
   Ayers had been with the department for 23 years. He is survived
by his wife, Betty Lou, and their three children.
   Lindsey, who had been with the department for 3{ years, is
survived by his wife, Melissa, who is expecting their first child.

   Q. Mr. President?

   And if we lose one, we'll be back and fight again.
   And I fought hard for John Tower because I believed in him.
   And I told you I didn't think the _ a lot of it was fair.
   But that's over.
   That's history.
   And now we are going to go forward.
   And I take Senator Mitchell and Senator Nunn at their word.
   They've given me their word, and that means a lot with me.
   And they want to move forward together, too.
   We've got time for just a couple more, and then I've got to go.
   Q. Mr. President _
   Bush: Tom?
   Q. _ please, back here!
   Bush: I can't hear, Sarah.
   Q. Mr. President, to follow up on the strategic defense question,
is _ are you and Congressman Cheney of one mind on the matter of
strategic defense, particularly deployment? Or is there some
distance between the two of you?
   Bush: Well, we're in general agreement, and I think as Dick gets
over there and gets into the details, he's going to have to make up
his _ after he's confirmed _ make up his mind on the _ after the
budget review is complete _ as to exactly what can be done and how
fast it can be done.
   There's no question of his support for SDI, nor mine.
   But in terms _ we aren't there yet, Tom, because we have to wait
until the reviews that we talked about are finished before we,
either of us, can definitively address levels of funding or where we
might go on those things.
   Q. Mr. President, do you assume that this nomination will receive
clear sailing in the Senate?
   Bush. Yes. I do.
   Q. Mr. President.
   Q. Mr. President _
   Bush: I do. I believe _
   Q. Mr. President.
   Bush: _ it'll go very fast, and I believe that it'll have smooth
sailing.
   Why? Because of Dick Cheney, because of the merits.
   Not because of anything that happened in the past.
   The merits.
   And we are going to try, incidentally, getting back to Mr.
Duffy's question _ or I think it was _ or Jerry's _ to accelerate
the clearance process and get that moving.
   We've got to do that.
   It is very important.
   Too much time has been wasted here.
   So we _ and we _ and I believe we can do it.
   We may have to take FBI resources off of a series of other
investigations for other appointments, but it's this important to
the country.
   Q. Mr. President.
   Bush: And so we'll move very, very fast.
   Now, Marlin tells me that that was the last question, but out of
respect for Sarah McClendon, who is persistent _ (laughter) _ but
who _ I will make now a new announcement of press policy, Sarah.

   The squeaking wheel will not always get the grease in life.

<HEAD>Government Attacked Over Reactor Breakdown, But Officials Say No
Danger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WIESBADEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition parties on Friday said
officials were irresponsible for not shutting down a nuclear power
plant where two of four emergency cooling systems broke down.
   The Hesse state government said there were no radioactive leaks
and the local population was not in danger in the accident Thursday
at the Biblis power plant 30 miles south of Frankfurt. The plant has
a history of problems.
   The state Environment Ministry said the two cooling systems broke
down after workers tried to fix a cooling water pump. An emergency
water pump also broke down, leaving only two emergency cooling
systems working, the ministry said in a statement.
   The reactor's output was reduced, but workers repaired the
malfunctioning pump and the unit was never shut down, the ministry
said. The cause was not immediately known, it said.
   ``There was no danger for the workers or for the environment,''
said ministry spokeswoman Annette Grossbongardt. ``No radioactivity
was released.''
   But the opposition Social Democrats and Greens parties in the
Hesse state legislature accused the ministry of playing an
``irresponsible game with the safety of the populace'' by keeping
the reactor running while the cause of the malfunction was unknown.
   Ernst Welteke, a Social Democratic leader in the Hesse
legislature, said the same unit of the Biblis plant had 175 recorded
malfunctions between 1975 and 1988, according to official government
documents.
   Several Social Democrats and Greens said the plant, one of the
oldest in West Germany, should be shut down.
   In December 1987, a small amount of radioactive steam was
released from the plant into the atmosphere. The accident caused a
public outcry when it was disclosed a year later.

<HEAD>Indian Fugitive Arrested After Soviets Reject His Plea for Political
Asylum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHLEEN MACLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fugitive Indian wanted on 14 kidnapping
charges in North Carolina was arrested Friday by the FBI after
failing to persuade officials at the Soviet consulate to grant him
political asylum.
   The fugitive, Eddie Hatcher, was inside the consulate about three
hours before the Soviets asked him to leave, said a friend who had
accompanied him inside. At one point Hatcher sent out a handwritten
statement claiming that federal and North Carolina officials were
trying to destroy him.
   Hatcher, 31, and Timothy Jacobs, 20, held as many as 20 people
hostage in the offices of The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton,
N.C. in February 1988. The two Tuscarora Indians said they took over
the newspaper to draw attention to their claims that law enforcement
officials were involved in drug trafficking and other corruption.
   The 10-hour siege ended when Gov. Jim Martin agreed to form a
state task force to investigate their charges. The task force found
no evidence to support the claims and Martin later said they were
based on rumor and gossip.
   ``The state of N.C. and the government of the United States has
made every vindictive attempt to destroy my life, my family and my
people. They will not cease until they have accomplished this,''
said Hatcher's statement, written on a sheet of yellow legal paper.
``I see no hope in the American government, nor do I see fairness.''
   In October, a federal jury acquitted both men on federal
hostage-taking and firearms charges after a three-week trial. But a
Robeson County grand jury indicted the two Indians in December on
kidnapping charges.
   After the indictment Hatcher was arrested in Pembroke, but Jacobs
sought sanctuary at the Onondaga Indian Reservation near Syracuse,
N.Y.
   Hatcher later fled to the same reservation after his $25,000 bond
was posted by the National Council of Churches. He then left New
York and sought refuge on the Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho,
disappearing from that reservation several weeks ago after being
taken under tribal custody.
   Jacobs was arrested in New York after leaving the reservation; a
state judge is considering whether he should be extradited to North
Carolina to face the charges.
   Both men have claimed their lives would be in jeopardy if they
return to Robeson County.
   In a telephone call from the consulate to The Associated Press
bureau in Raleigh, N.C. Hatcher said he gave the Soviets documents
and news articles to support his plea for political asylum.
   Bernadette Sambrano, a member of the International Indian Treaty
Council who was with Hatcher inside the consulate, said the Soviets
rejected his request and asked him to leave. Hatcher was arrested by
FBI agents as soon as he walked off the grounds.
   Sergei Aivazion, Soviet press attache for the consulate, said he
had no comment on the incident. Chuck Latting, spokesman for the
FBI's San Francisco office, was also not immediately available for
comment, his office said.
   ``The people in the United States are always crying about human
rights violations in the Soviet Union,'' Hatcher said in the
telephone interview. ``I want them to know about the human rights
violations in this country against the Indians and the poor. ...
   ``I'm tired of being persecuted for winning the federal case,''
he said.
   Hatcher's attorney, civil rights lawyer William Kunstler, reached
by The Associated Press before Hatcher's surrender, said he had
spoken with his client at the consulate and was waiting to see what
would happen.
   ``I would urge them to give him sanctuary,'' Kunstler said.

<HEAD>Defense Department Charged With Violating Pentagon Procurement Procedures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An internal investigation has uncovered
improper use of an information computer system of the Library of
Congress by some military agencies which may have tried to bypass
regular Pentagon procurement procedures in awarding research
contracts, Librarian James H. Billington said Friday.
   Billington said the Library had ordered the Federal Library and
Information Network (FEDLINK) to cancel the contracts or transfer
them to the proper Pentagon authorities.
   Under Library of Congress jurisdiction, FEDLINK administers
information and library services contracts on behalf of member
libraries and information centers in order to get the best possible
price for the government. The services are open to any federal
agency.
   FEDLINK has grown since 1976 to become the nation's largest
provider of automated library network services, according to
Billington. It gives government libraries and other government
participants access to hundreds of databases and to many new
information technologies.
   During the investigation which began in January, it was learned
that FEDLINK had been signing contracts for services which had
nothing to do with libraries or information databases, according to
the Library's inspector general, John W. Rensbarger.
   He said various contractors were to provide services which
included ``an analysis, assessments and independent appraisals of
the Navy's AH-lW Night Targeting System,'' ``development of a
standard Missile-2 Security Plan,'' and ``support of the Army
Machine Gun Program.''
   By using FEDLINK's contracting services, procurement officers at
several U.S. military installations, such as the Navy's Charleston,
S.C., shipyard and the Air Force's Seventh Communications Group in
Washington, D.C., apparently bypassed special Pentagon rules on
competitive bidding and other procurement procedures, said
Rensbarger.
   He said the questionable contracts involved orders from various
Army, Navy and Air Force units totalling some $45 million last
fiscal year. Total FEDLINK activities in the fiscal year which ended
Sept. 30 involved contracts for $97.1 million with 135 vendors to
provide services for some 1,395 different federal entities,
according to the Library.
   ``We still do not know why these inappropriate contracts were
made,'' said Rensbarger. ``Our investigation and that of the Defense
Department are continuing.''
   A Pentagon spokeswoman had no immediate comment on the report.

   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt denied
on Friday that his country is assembling Swiss-made parts that could
be used to create a chemical weapons plant at Abu Zaabal, north of
Cairo.
   ``This is the first I've heard of it,'' Mubarak told reporters.
   ``We are against chemical weapons and, of course, don't make any
such factories. We don't back the idea of such factories or even
nuclear ones.''
   The New York Times said Friday that U.S. officials believe Egypt
is assembling Swiss-made parts that could be used to build a
chemical arms plant.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington the
United States opposes all weapons of mass destruction _ chemical,
biological and nuclear _ and has raised the issue with Egypt.
   Washington has accused Libya, the radical North African nation
bordering Egypt, of building a plant capable of producing poison gas
at Rabta, about 60 miles north of the Libyan capital of Tripoli.
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi has replied, ``This is a medical
plant.''
   Mubarak spoke Friday after he met with senior European Economic
Community officials, including EEC Commission President Jacques
Delors, as part of a European tour to win support for an
international Middle East peace conference which Israel opposes.
   Mubarak also discussed his economic reform program at the EEC
head office.
   The Swiss engineering company Krebs A.G. said Friday it has cut
its business links with a military-industrial complex in Egypt that
reportedly planned to build the poison gas plant.
   Krebs said it believed the parts it shipped to Egypt would be
used to produce pharmaceuticals. Krebs' president, Hans Rudolf
Weber, told The Associated Press on Friday that the company severed
its business relationship with the Egyptian complex on advice of the
Swiss government. He would not elaborate.
   The New York Times report said Krebs delivered to Egypt parts
that will be installed in the plant, which it said is part of a
military-industrial complex that is also scheduled to include a
joint Egyptian-American plant for assembling the M-1 tank.
   Mohammed Wahby, a spokesman for Egypt's Embassy in Washington,
denied the report earlier. ``We are not involved in the manufacture
of chemical weapons,'' the Times quoted him as saying.
   The Times quoted an unidentified U.S. official as saying Bush
administration efforts to stop proliferation of chemical weapons
applies to all countries and not just those which have had hostile
relations with America.
   The newspaper quoted another U.S. official as saying Washington
recently told Cairo it was concerned about the project.
   Redman said the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ``in
areas of instability such as the Middle East is a particular
concern'' and the United States has urged ``all states in the region
to forgo the development and acquisition of all such weapons.''
   He said the issue has been raised with Egypt but gave no details.
   ``In the case of Egypt, we consult frequently and closely on
these kind of subjects,'' Redman said. ``The Krebs-Egyptian project
again illustrates the difficulties of controlling production
technologies that have dual uses, both legitimate civilian uses and
potential chemical weapons uses.
   ``We have been in touch on this particular issue with the Swiss
government for some time. The attitude of the Swiss government has
been serious and responsible.''

<HEAD>Parliament Head: Doctrine Of Limited Sovereignty Is Dead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's new president of Parliament
said Friday the ``Brezhnev Doctrine'' of limited sovereignty for
Soviet allies is dead.
   Also Friday, the official MTI news agency reported the ruling
Communist Party has committed itself to reforms that include free
elections in a multiple-party system, representative democracy and a
free press. The party also expressed willingness to form a coalition
government.
   Matyas Szyeroes, elected president of the body Friday, told a
news conference that Hungary must never be servile and accept advice
that would erode its independence.
   ``In Hungarian-Soviet relations, the `Brezhnev Doctrine' is
already dead,'' said Szueroes, the Communist Party Central
Committee's secretary in charge of foreign affairs.
   The ``Brezhnev Doctrine'' permits military intervention in a
Soviet bloc country in the event of a liberal insurrection. The late
President Leonid I. Brezhnev announced it after the Red Arnmy
crushed the liberal ``Prague Spring'' of 1968 in Czechoslovakia.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III this week urged Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to renounce the doctrine.
   ``Those in the East should be free of the fear that armed Soviet
intervention, justified by the `Brezhnev Doctrine,' would be used
again to deny them choice,'' Baker said in a speech in Vienna on
Monday.
   In an interview published in the Magyar Nemzet daily on March 4,
Szueroes said Soviet-Hungarian relations did not develop over the
years ``in the spirit of equal rights and mutual benefits.''
   ``The `Brezhnev Doctrine' caused a further deformation,
accompanied by greater power aspects on the one side, and a kind of
servility on the other, as well as insistence on certain dogmas
until the mid-1980s,'' he said.
   Those comments and others Szueroes made in a radio interview
indicated criticism of the Hungarian leadership under party chief
Janos Kadar, who was replaced by Karoly Grosz in May.
   On Friday, Szueroes said: ``Even at the time of the `Brezhnev
Doctrine,' a lot depended on the leadership of the small countries,
whether they subjected themselves to it or tried to serve more
consistently the interests of their own country.''
   He also reiterated an earlier statement that in the future
Hungary could adopt a neutral foreign policy.
   In an action program published Friday, the policy-making Central
Committee said it supports ``representative democracy'' and an
independent judiciary, free elections and open politics based on the
constitution.
   It also expressed willingness to consider ``the possibility of
coalition in governing.''
   Other pledges in the document, adopted Tuesday and carried Friday
the MTI news agency, included independent trade unions and interest
groups, free creative and intellectual work, freedom of conscience
and religion, individual rights and administration free of
corruption.
   The document said the reforms could be preserved by legal
guarantees, openenness and a ``reponsible, free press.''
   The document also mentioned ``mistakes'' by the Communist
leadership under Kadar, who gained power after Soviet troops crushed
the Hungarian uprising of 1956.
   In emphasizing the need for reform, the Central Committee said
the current economic and political structure was ``full of
mistakes.''
   Last month, the leadership said it would accept a new
constitution that omits references to the party's leading role and
endorses the development of a pluralistic society.
   Hungary has embarked on an ambitious reform program. Parliament
approved a set of draft principles this week that Justice Ministry
officials said would guarantee a multiparty system and separation of
powers.
   In another development Friday, Interior Minister Istvan Horvath
outlined a program to deal with the continuing influx of refugees
from neighboring Romania. He said Romania continued to discriminate
against minorities, many of whom are ethnic Hungarians.
   Horvath said Romania approved 1,936 emigration requests last
year, more than double the number in 1987. He said the government
plans to set up refugee stations to process residency requests.

<TEXT>
   The father of a teen-ager who died
unexpectedly three years after receiving the transplanted heart of
her would-be boyfriend said Thursday he knows now what the donor's
family went through.
   ``When you walk in and see your daughter dead, it hurts bad,''
said Raymond Ashlock on the eve of the funeral of his daughter,
Donna.
   Donna, who would have been 18 on April 1, had turned down her
father's telephone invitation to go to lunch at 11:20 a.m., he said.
When Ashlock came home at noon, he found her dead in bed with the
phone next to her.
   ``It was a shock,'' Ashlock said. ``There were no signs of her
being sick.'' He noted she had been hospitalized with a flulike
illness three or four weeks ago ``but snapped right out of it.''
   Hospital officials said that the death apparently occurred during
a nap as a result of irregular beating of the heart, a common
complication in heart transplants. Donna had experienced some
rejection of the heart, and had been scheduled for a second
transplant.
   Ashlock said his daughter would not have lived the past three
years without the heart she received from a high school classmate
and admirer, Felipe Garza. ``I thought I knew what the Garzas went
through three years ago, but I didn't,'' the red-eyed father said.
Ashlock said Felipe's parents came to his home to offer condolences
hours after Donna's death.
   Felipe, who had a crush on Donna, suddenly collapsed and died of
a brain hemorrhage on Jan. 4, 1986. Although he wasn't sick, he had
suffered blackouts and had mentioned that he wanted Donna to have
his heart if he died. Her original heart had been irreparably
damaged by a virus.
   The story was widely publicized, and Donna got to meet President
Reagan and singer Michael Jackson, and was the honored guest at an
American Heart Association Valentine's Day dance.
   Donna returned to high school in this Central California farming
town 75 miles southeast of San Francisco and resumed as normal a
life as possible, considering her sudden fame, heart medication and
frequent trips to San Francisco for medical care.
   Ashlock said Donna will be buried Friday in a pink casket
decorated with roses identical to one she liked at the recent
funeral of a family friend.
   ``She said, `if I die, I want to be buried like that,''' Ashlock
said.

   Hundreds of students marched Friday
protesting the government's employment policies, and about 150 began
a hunger strike.
   Their action added tension to the crisis over the formation of a
new government by Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi.
   Leaders of some of Sudan's political parties and trade unions, in
an effort to force Madi to resign, announced Friday they would not
consult with the prime minister.
   Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that the opposition
leaders, after a five-hour meeting, decided to send an ultimatum to
Mahdi insisting he step down within 24 hours. They did not say what
they would do if Mahdi refused.
   Representatives from Mahdi's Umma Party and the National Islamic
Front, which is a partner in the coalition Cabinet, did not attend
the meeing. There was no immediate reaction to the ultimatum from
Mahdi.
   Last month the army demanded that Mahdi and the Umma party open
negotiations with other groups to form a broad-based Cabinet that
would arrange a peace agreement with the rebels of the People's
Liberation Army and end the 6-year-old civil war in southern Sudan.
   The army on Thursday repeated its demand. Western diplomats said
the army action implied the threat of a military takeover, but
senior generals did not appear ready to move against Mahdi.
   The dispute began in January when the Democratic Unionist Party,
the second largest party in Parliament, quit Mahdi's government
because he refused to endorse a proposed peace agreement the
Democratic Unionists had worked out with the People's Liberation
Army on Nov. 16.
   One of the clauses in that agreement calls for the suspension of
Islamic laws, a condition rejected by the National Islamic Front.
   About 850 graduate students took part in the march protesting
regulations requiring language examinations before possible
employment in the public sector.
   Police stood guard Friday night outside the building where the
hunger strikers began their fast. The government promised to respond
within a day to the protesters' demand that the the language tests
be ended.
   Faddlallah Ali Fadl, minister of administrative reform, said the
tests were to screen graduates for available positions but the
protesters claimed they were designed to reduce employment.
   In a similar protest last year students set fire to a government
employment office.

   A teen-ager who had received the heart
of a high school admirer in a 1986 transplant operation was
remembered at her funeral Friday as ``truly a profile in courage.''
   Before a crowd of 500 that oveflowed the church and stretched for
a full block down the sidewalk, the Rev. Paul Fliflet praised
17-year-old Donna Ashlock's courage and strength and thanked God
``for the impact she has made on many other people's lives.''
   The Assembly of God pastor also saluted Donna's parents for their
fortitude since their daughter received a transplanted heart in
January 1986 from a high school classmate, Felipe Garza.
   ``For three years, Mary and Ray Ashlock lived from crisis to
crisis,'' the minister said. ``To see the devotion they had for this
daughter would touch anyone's heart.''
   Donna gained national celebrity because of the uniqueness of her
heart transplant. Felipe, who had had a crush on her, told his
family that if he should die he wanted his heart to go to Donna, who
needed a new heart because hers was irreversibly damaged by a virus.
   Even though he had not been ill, Felipe collapsed on Jan. 4,
1986, and died of a cerebral hemhorrage. The size of his heart and
his tissue type were a good match for Donna, and his heart was
placed in her body.
   But Donna's body kept trying to reject her donated heart, leading
to her death Tuesday.
   She was buried in the same cemetery where Felipe is interred.
   At the funeral, many of Donna's friends at Patterson High School
wore pink ribbons as armbands. Those who could not fit inside the
church listened to the service broadcast over a loudspeaker.

   A pipe bomb Friday destroyed a van driven by the
wife of of the skipper of the USS Vincennes, which mistakenly shot
down an Iranian airliner last year. Authorities suspect it was a
terrorist attack.
   Sharon Rogers escaped just seconds before the van burst into
flames.
   ``They (the FBI) view this incident as an act of retribution
against Capt. Rogers for the incident in the Middle East,'' said Ted
Royster, assistant special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms' Los Angeles field office. He said he assigned
six agents to help the FBI.
   A Justice Department source in Washington who spoke on condition
of anonymity said investigators suspect the bombing was the work of
terrorists. However, local FBI investigators would not confirm that
theory.
   ``We have no motive at this point in time _ certainly, we have no
suspects,'' Tom Hughes, special agent in charge of the local FBI
office, told reporters.
   ``We certainly do not rule out the potential retribution to Capt.
Rogers for his ... command in the Navy,'' he said. ``But on the same
token this could have been perpetrated for some other reason unknown
at this time.''
   Mrs. Rogers was uninjured and was taken to a police station,
where she was joined by her husband, Capt. Will Rogers III. Rogers
was home at the time of the blast and authorities placed the family
under protection. Their son was away at college and was notified.
   Mrs. Rogers, a school teacher, was driving alone to school and
was stopped at a red light when the bomb exploded at 7:45 a.m. The
pipe bomb was planted on the underside of the white Toyota van,
police spokesman Bill Robinson said.
   Robinson said pieces of the pipe bomb were recovered.
Nevertheless, the FBI was not prepared to confirm the type of
device, the type of explosive used or how it was detonated, Hughes
said.
   ``She got out just as it blew,'' said Kurt Lent, a construction
worker who witnessed the explosion.
   John Christy, owner of a nearby masonry company, said he heard
two loud pops followed by a loud explosion. Running outside, he saw
the vehicle engulfed in flames and a woman standing near it.
   ``For what had just happened, she reacted (like) a real strong
type of person ... she took it very well,'' he said. ``She just
wanted me to call her husband. I called her husband, he came down
here maybe about four minutes later. They embraced and went from
there.''
   A message from the Rogerses was relayed by Cmdr. David Dillon,
spokesman for the Naval Surface Force Pacific Fleet, to which the
Vincennes is assigned.
   ``I talked with Capt. Rogers and Mrs. Rogers this morning at the
police station. They wanted to pass on that Mrs. Rogers was fine and
in good shape,'' he said.
   Asked about Rogers' reaction to the bombing, Dillon said, ``I
think he's just exasperated by the whole thing. Obviously he's
concerned about what happened to his wife. They just want to get on
to other things.''
   Investigators went to the Rogerses' home to check for any other
bombs, and authorities investigated a report of a vehicle following
Mrs. Rogers.
   ``There was a vehicle that was observed in the area at the time
of the detonation, and we're looking into that right now,'' said FBI
spokesman Ronald Orrantia. There was no immediate claim of
responsibility.
   The Navy increased its security at the San Diego Navy base and
other facilities, Navy Chief Craig Huebler said. Other Vincennes
crewmembers and their families were notified.
   The Vincennes, a guided-missile cruiser based in San Diego,
returned from its six-month Persian Gulf deployment last October. It
remains in port and Rogers remains its skipper.
   As the Vincennes exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats last July
3, Iran Air Flight 655 appeared on the U.S. warship's high-tech
radar. After the plane failed to respond to warnings on civilian and
military channels, Rogers gave the order to fire.
   The decision, he said later, was in defense of his ship and crew.
But what Rogers feared was an Iranian F-14 fighter actually was an
Airbus A300 wih 290 people aboard, all of whom died. The Reagan
administration defended the decision but also decided to compensate
the victims' families.
   After the shooting, Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for
an all-out war against the United States. Speculation after the
December destruction of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland,
focused on whether that bombing was in retaliation for the
Vincennes' action.
   FBI special agent Gene Riehl said investigators were not ruling
anything out in Friday's bombing.
   ``The fact that she is the wife of the captain of the Vincennes,
you could draw your own conclusions about whether it's a random
bombing or there's some connection,'' he said. ``We're not making
any suppositions.''
   In Washington, Navy officials at the Pentagon said they were
unaware of any threats against Rogers or his family, but were
awaiting additional reports from San Diego.
   After the Vincennes returned to San Diego, Rogers expressed
regret over the deaths of the Iranian passengers.
   ``I, as well as my crew, will live with the result of the tragic
loss of civilian lives associated with these actions, tempered only
by the belief I had no other course of action and that any prudent
commanding officer would do the same,'' he said.
   Robinson said no other bombs were found on the van. The blast and
fire shattered the van's windows, flattened its tires and melted its
paint.
   Lent, who watched the van explode, said he heard a pair of
backfires, separated by a 10-second interval, and then a loud
explosion.
   ``It went `Boom!' `Boom!', then `Bam!''' he said. ``It worked
real quick.''
   After seeing that she got out of the van, Lent ran to the flaming
vehicle to make sure no one was inside. He and fellow workers
directed traffic while their supervisor escorted her to a pickup.
   ``She was shaken up, obviously,'' said Lew Davis, another worker.
   Police sealed off the area, and the FBI took over the
investigation from local authorities. Naval Investigative Service
officials also were called in.

   A small air taxi frequently used by tourists
crashed into a two-story building in a Lima suburb Friday during
foggy weather, killing all 10 people on board, officials said.
   There were no immediate reports of people hurt or killed on the
ground.
   The official from the Aerocondor company said the plane was
returning from flying over the famous Nazca lines, 250 miles
southeast of Lima, when it crashed. The Nazca lines are pre-Hispanic
drawings in the desert believed to represent a primitive calendar.
   The Aerocondor official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said in an interview from the crash site that the pilot, co-pilot
and all eight passengers on board had died.
   He said he did not have the identities of the passengers, but a
police official said they included foreigners. Both officials spoke
in interviews broadcast on Radioprogramas, Peru's leading radio news
station.

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military security is paramount here, the home of
the nation's largest Navy complex with 12 major facilities including
a submarine base, two air stations and a vast Marine Corps base.
   ``San Diego is a big Navy town. It (security) is a big concern
for us and a big concern for the Navy,'' police Sgt. Dave Douglas
said Friday.
   Security was tightened Friday following a bomb attack on a van
driven by the wife of Capt. Will Rogers III, the USS Vincennes
commander who directed the attack that mistakenly downed an Iranian
airliner.
   ``We don't discuss security. We just say it's an increase in
security measures,'' said Navy Chief Craig Huebler, spokesman for
the Naval Base San Diego. ``Increased, heightened awareness.''
   No special measures were imposed in October when the Vincennes
returned from its deployment in the Persian Gulf, he said. The ship
was protecting oil and merchant shipping from crossfire of the
Iran-Iraq war.
   ``We had no special security arrangments made at the time, nor
have there been any special security arrangements made with anybody
aboard the ship or their families,'' Huebler said.
   There also is no record of any threats being made against Rogers,
his family or any other crewmember of the Vincennes, he said.
   State Rep. Bill Lowery, a Rogers family friend, said the captain
said Friday that he hadn't expected to be vulnerable in San Diego,
the nation's sixth-largest city known as much as a sunny vacation
spot as a military town.
   Rogers said those stationed abroad certainly realize they're at
peril, Lowery said. But ``no one expects you have to be worrying
about your wives and kids back home,'' Lowery quoted Rogers as
saying.
   Rogers and wife were being protected, as was their son, who is
attending school in Colorado, officials said. The couple had been
living in the La Jolla area as Rogers awaited his next assignment.
   FBI and Naval Investigative Services agents, police and
bomb-sniffing dogs made a sweep of the Rogers' home and neighborhood
Friday after the explosion.
   Huebler said a decision on further security measures would depend
on what is discovered by the FBI, which is conducting the
investigation into the bombing. Protecting off-base personnel
presents difficulties, Huebler added.
   ``You're talking about ... a family living out in the San Diego
community, and when you're living in that environment there's not a
great deal that you can do on a regular basis,'' he said.
   There are 141,000 sailors and Marines in the San Diego area,
including the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base. Because of the
number of personnel, combined with the total acreage of Navy and
Marine facilities, it is commonly considered the nation's largest
Navy complex, Huebler said.
   The Marine Corps is under the direction of the Secretary of the
Navy.
   Large-scale security exercises are held annually in San Diego,
and all of the bases go through their own security exercises
annually, Huebler said. ``There have not been any major breaches of
security in San Diego,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   United Nations peacekeepers began
arriving Friday to monitor the territory's transition to
independence.
   Twenty-four officers from the Finnish and Danish armies were the
first peacekeepers to arrive. They were joined by U.N.
administrative personnel from Poland, Canada, Spain, Italy and other
countries.
   A 70-man British army signals unit also flew to Namibia to
provide communications for the multinational force.
   The U.N.-approved independence process in Namibia officially
begins April 1, but a large portion of the 4,650-member peacekeeping
force is expected to arrive before then. The South
African-controlled territorial army is scheduled to leave by April
30.
   South Africa has administered Namibia since World War I but
agreed last year to grant independence as part of a regional peace
accord which also calls for the phased withdrawal of Cuban troops
from Angola.
   The largest components of the peacekeeping force will be
battalions from Finland, Malaysia and Kenya. Col. Hanno Paronen,
leader of the Finnish contingent that arrived Friday, said the Finns
would be based in Caprivi, a narrow strip of land in the
northeastern corner of Namibia.
   The peacekeepers will monitor voting scheduled for early November
to elect an assembly that will draft a constitution for an
independent Namibia.
   The South-West African People's Organization, which has waged a
guerrilla war against South African rule since 1966, is favored to
win. But it may have difficulty collecting the two-thirds' support
needed for complete control of the assembly.
   Two groups of Australians are due in Windhoek by Sunday,
according to Maj. John Hutchings, an Australian officer who serves
as a U.N. military consultant.

<HEAD>Four Blacks Get Death Sentence For Killing Strikebreakers; Mine Fire
Kills 10</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge sentenced four black
union members to death Friday for the murders of four black
co-workers who refused to join a rail strike in 1987.
   Four more black members of the South African Railway and Harbor
Workers Union who also pleaded guilty to the same killings were
sentenced to prison terms of between eight and 12 years by
Johannesburg Supreme Court Judge T.T. Spoelstra, who cited
extenuating circumstances in their cases.
   According to evidence at the trial, many workers who refused to
join a strike against the state rail company in March and April 1987
were kidnapped and beaten at the Johannesburg headquarters of the
Congress of South African Trade Unions, a black labor federation.
The Railway and Harbor Workers Union is an affiliate of the labor
federation.
   Five employees who had defied the strike were beaten at the
federation building, then taken to an empty lot to be killed,
according to court testimony. One of the five escaped, while the
other four were stabbed and set afire, according to the testimony.
   The killings occurred April 20, 1987, near the end of a
seven-week strike by about 18,000 black rail workers against South
African Transport Services.
   Eight union members who pleaded guilty to charges of attempted
murder, assault, kidnapping and intimidation received suspended
sentences at the Supreme Court.
   The sentences followed a hearing that concluded Thursday on
whether there were extenuating circumstances. All 16 pleaded guilty
last year.
   The four men sentenced to death are: Wilson Matshili, 33, Patrick
Molefe, 27, Takalani Mamphanga 25, and George Maugedzo, 36. No
execution date was set.
   Also Friday, a mining company said 10 men were killed and 22
injured in a fire at a gold mine.
   Anglo-American Corp. said the fire broke out Thursday evening at
the Vaal Reef Gold Mine outside Johannesburg in a shaft 1.3 miles
below ground.
   Company spokesman Paul Clothier said the cause of the fire was
unknown and an investigation would be conducted.
   Several hunderd miners die each year in the country's gold and
coal mines.

   The pilot praised for safely landing a United
Airlines jet that lost a chunk of its fuselage and nine passengers
in flight is being forced to retire as he turns 60 this month, and
he's not happy about it.
   ``I would certainly love to keep flying,'' United Capt. David M.
Cronin, who turns 60 on March 23, said Thursday at Honolulu
International Airport. ``Unfortunately, they can't put new rivets in
me.''
   Cronin was greeted by family and friends following his last
flight after 35 years with the airline.
   ``Just look at him,'' said his daughter K.C. Cronin, 32. ``Does
he look like he's ready to retire?''
   Cronin complained that the federal government's requirement of
mandatory retirement at his age is outdated, but he didn't know
whether he would use his new celebrity status to try to get the rule
repealed.
   ``Things have just been going too fast these last two weeks, I
really haven't had time to think about that,'' Cronin said.
   Cronin was the pilot of United Flight 811 when the right forward
cargo door of the Boeing 747 tore off at 22,000 feet on Feb. 24.
   Nine of the 354 people on board were killed when they were sucked
from the jet, and 27 others suffered mostly minor injuries.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Clears Way For Execution Of Mass Killer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court cleared the way
Friday for the execution of a man who killed 14 relatives, ruling
that he ``knowingly and intelligently'' had waived his right to
appeal the death sentence.
   R. Gene Simmons is scheduled to be executed by injection Thursday
if no appeal is made to the federal courts. No one has been executed
in Arkansas in 25 years.
   The bodies of his relatives were found in his home and property
near Dover, where authorities ities went after Simmons was arrested
for a 40-minute shooting rampage in Russellville on Dec. 28, 1987.
   Simmons, 48, was sentenced to death last month for the slayings
and on Thursday, Simmons asked the high court to hurry its review of
his competency to waive appeals from last month's conviction.
   ``After a careful review of the record and exhibits, we affirm
the trial court's decision that the petitioner has knowingly and
intelligently waived his right to appeal,'' the court said in its
three-page opinion.
   Simmons also was convicted last May of killing two people during
the Russellsville rampage and was sentenced to death.
   In August, U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Eisele halted his
execution for those killings, but on Thursday lifted his order after
consulting with Simmons and John Wesley Hall, an attorney appointed
to review the Simmons' first trial transcript for possible
appealable errors.
   Simmons' conviction for the Russellville slayings was challenged
by the Rev. Louis Franz, a death penalty opponent who contended in
both courts that Simmons was not competent to waive the appeal.
   Franz' lawyer, Mark Cambiano, said Franz would not intervene in
the second conviction.
   ``The decision to appeal or not appeal is a personal one,''
Simmons told reporters after Eisele's decision. He said he would
``not be strong-armed by any courts'' to justify his decision.
   After an execution date was set in the first trial, Simmons asked
that no one interfere in the case. He said the sentence was just,
pleading, ``Let the torture and suffering in me end.''

   Eastern Airlines fought back against a crippling
strike Friday by packing its Northeast Shuttle with passengers at
$12 a head and announcing restoration of 80 flights a day, mostly
Latin American and top domestic routes.
   But thousands of angry and confused Eastern ticket holders trying
to get refunds or fly on other carriers learned they would have to
pay more or put in their claims in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, where the
carrier filed for Chapter 11 reorganization on Thursday.
   A judge in New York extended his order barring commuter railroad
workers from honoring any picket lines thrown up by Eastern's
striking Machinists union.
   On Friday, lawyers for the Machinists said they would ask the
bankruptcy court to unfreeze striking workers' final pre-strike
paychecks, since Judge Burton R. Lifland on Thursday allowed Eastern
to pay nonstriking employees.
   ``It seems not coincidental that the timing of the bankruptcy was
intended to deny these employees the wages for the work they
performed,'' said attorney Robert Clayman. The 8,500 Machinists are
owed about $7.5 million dollars.
   ``We are going to rebuild this airline in prudent, sensible
increments and get our men and women back to work so they can
support their families,'' Eastern President Phil Bakes said Friday.
``This is the beginning of a new smaller, restructured and viable
Eastern Airlines.''
   Eastern said the more than 140 daily flights, including 62
shuttle flights connecting Boston, New York and Washington, would be
operated with picket line-crossing employees who have been with the
company since before the start of the strike Saturday over Eastern's
demand for contract concessions.
   But strikers charged the crews on the restored flights beginning
Sunday and Monday will be from Eastern's sister carrier, Continental
Airlines, and vowed to extend pickets to that airline, treating
parent Texas Air Corp. as a single company.
   Eastern pilots honoring the picket lines also accused the company
of ``stepping up its campaign to threaten, coerce and otherwise
entice pilots to cross'' the picket line.
   ``This includes illegal offers of bonuses for second officers and
phone calls to pilots' homes, attempting to intimidate spouses, and
even their children, with threats that their breadwinner will never
be able to work again for Eastern,'' said Ron Cole, an Air Line
Pilots Association spokesman.
   More than 300 workers from around New Jersey rallied Friday in
support of the Eastern machinists, offering them money and help
walking picket lines.
   ``I have never ... seen this kind of solidarity,'' said Matthew
Adams, AFL-CIO regional representative from Washington, D.C.
   From the rally, workers went to Newark International Airport for
a demonstration outside the terminal used by Continental. Police
estimated 350-400 people rallied at the airport.
   At New York City's LaGuardia Airport, three of the region's
Democratic congressmen _ Thomas Downey, Gary Ackerman and Charles
Schumer _ joined strikers on the picket line outside the Eastern
shuttle terminal.
   Most of Eastern's pilots and flight attendants honored the
Machinists' picket lines and the airline's pre-strike schedule of
1,050 flights a day had fallen to 62 flights a day on its Northeast
shuttle and three a week to Latin America.
   That pushed the nation's seventh-largest carrier to file for
financial reorganization Thursday in the fifth-biggest Chapter 11
filing in terms of company assets. The strike is costing Eastern
about $4 million a day.
   Eastern management listed more than $4.5 billion in net assets,
$3.39 billion in liabilities and 15,696 creditors.
   In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked
if there was any chance President Bush might change his mind on
intervening in the Eastern strike. ``He's not rethinking it,''
Fitzwater said.
   Frank Borman, the former astronaut who once headed Eastern,
blamed the strike and the airline's decision to file for Chapter 11
on Charles Bryan, head of the International Association of
Machinists.
   Borman said Thursday in Las Cruces, N.M., where he lives, that
Eastern had good relations with the union before Bryan's 1980
election.
   ``We had the biggest profit-sharing program in the industry,''
Borman said, adding that Bryan terminated that program when he was
elected.
   The first Eastern shuttle to leave Boston for New York and
Washington with the new $12 one-way fare Friday had 92 people on
board, said a spokesman for the Massachusetts Port Authority, which
operates Logan International Airport.
   Although figures were not immediately available for passengers
who took advantage of the offer throughout the day, Eastern
spokesman Robin Matell said that demand had exceeded capacity.
   The previous weekend fare for the shuttle was $69, and the
original $99 weekday fare was lowered to $49. Spokesman Phil
Orlandella said previous shuttle flights during the strike carried
as few as seven passengers.
   Many holders of Eastern tickets learned they would have to pay
higher fares on most other carriers or join a long line of unsecured
creditors seeking refunds in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.
   ``This has been one of those days that we all hope would never
happen,'' said Phil Davidoff, president-elect of the 23,000-member
American Society of Travel Agents.
   But a threat to the 320,000 commuters who use trains in the New
York City area eased when a federal judge, who had temporarily
barred commuter railroad workers from honoring picket lines,
extended his order indefinitely beyond a Friday midnight deadline
pending his decision on whether to allow picketing.
   A federal appeals court panel in Philadelphia issued a similar
ban for that area.
   Eastern intends to resume its profitable service between Miami
and 13 Latin American cities and restore flights linking Boston and
Washington; Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico; Miami and New York; and
New York and Montreal, Eastern officials in Miami said.
   The exact number of non-union employees who will be recalled to
help had not been determined, they said. The carrier laid off 9,500
non-union employees this week and said it had 200 pilots available
before shutting most routes Monday.
   ``Those pilots will cover our new schedule,'' Eastern spokeswoman
Cory Zywotow said, adding that ``since the bankruptcy filing, pilots
have been calling in to report back to work.''
   But Machinists union officer Wally Haber charged Eastern has
brought 100 pilots and 60 mechanics from Continental to Miami to
wear Eastern uniforms and operate the restored flights, denying
Eastern pilots would cross picket lines.
   ``If we're successful he (Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo) won't
build anything until we have some new management at Eastern. With
new management at Eastern, we can settle our differences in 24
hours,'' Haber said.
   J.B. Stokes, an 17-year Eastern pilot and spokesman for the Air
Line Pilots Association, said a retraining program was allowing
Eastern to expand its routes.
   ``They're going to be able to slightly augment the current
schedule, but they're just trying to maximize the available pool of
pilots,'' he said. ``They've moved them to different locations to
give the image of its expanded flight schedule.''
   Eastern employment stood at 31,200 before the strike was launched
March 4 but has shrunk to 1,500. Most of the 3,600 pilots and 5,900
flight attendants honored picket lines set up by the 8,500-member
Machinists union.
   About 3,200 Eastern workers have filed for 26 weeks of
unemployment benefits at a temporary office set up in Miami, and
another office is being set up strictly for job placement.
   ``My offices are really, really strained,'' said Marianne
Salazar, employment and training regional manager for the Florida
state Labor Department.
   Jose Marquez, a 10-year flight attendant, went to apply for
unemployment with his wife and 2-year-old son. ``I think senior
people might come back to work but not me,'' he said.
   Those are eligible for benefits will receive about half their
average weekly wages up to $200 for up to 26 weeks. They also must
actively seek employment.

   Government and opposition negotiators, in a breakthrough that
could give Poland the first democratic national elections in the

parliament open to all candidates.
   The agreement also calls for 35 percent of the seats in the

   Additionally, the sides agreed in principle to establish a post
of president who would be elected by a majority of both chambers of

   One out of every three eighth- and 10th-graders
surveyed in 20 states said they have seriously considered killing
themselves, and many have poor health habits that include drinking,
smoking and ignorance of safe sex.
   Thirty-four percent of the 11,000 students _ 25 percent of the
boys and 42 percent of the girls _ reported that they had thought
seriously about ending their lives, and 15 percent had gone so far
as to attempt potentially fatal injuries, the national Centers for
Disease Control reported Thursday.
   Dr. Lloyd Kolbe, director of the CDC's Division of Adolescent and
School Health, said the suicide figures were surprising. ``We just
didn't think it would be that high,'' he said.
   He said it was the first time the suicide question had been asked

   Oliver North angrily complained about having to
answer ``asinine'' congressional questions, according to a witness
in his trial on charges of lying to Congress about the Iran-Contra

   Daniel L. Conrad, the liaison between North and conservative
fund-raiser Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, said North made the comment in

North's office.
   Conrad's name appeared on a log at the Old Executive Office

be so often,'' Conrad testified Thursday.
   Conrad said North told him the National Security Council recently

for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. At the time, Congress had banned
U.S. aid to the Contras.

   The proposal is being billed essentially as an evolution of the
debt policy adopted by the Reagan administration but in one key
respect it is likely to go much farther.
   According to sources who have been in discussions with
administration officials, the plan will explore various ways to
encourage commercial banks to forgive a portion of the debt they
hold.
   The Reagan administration repeatedly rejected proposals for
broad-based programs aimed at debt forgiveness.

   The Soviet Union lodged a ``resolute protest''
over the expulsion of a military attache allegedly involved in a spy
operation aimed at learning how the U.S. government protects
computer secrets.
   Lt. Col. Yuriy Nikolayevich Pakhtusov, 35, was told to leave
Thursday. An FBI investigation had led to his arrest Wednesday
night, just a day after the Bush administration opened a high-level
dialogue with the Soviet Union.
   Pakhtusov was described by a U.S. source as a significant catch
because he is a member of the Red Army's GRU intelligence arm. One
official said Pakhtusov was caught ``red-handed.''
   But the Soviet Embassy issued a statement saying the expulsion
order ``could be only qualified as a deliberate provocation against
a Soviet diplomatic official.''

   This is the first story in a three-part Easter
series, ``The Military and Jesus,'' about Jesus and his involvement
with the Roman rulers of the time, based on the Bible and historical
and ancient non-canonical Christian writings.

   ``Fall in!'' The Roman troops, roused from their barracks in the
second watch of night, sleepily formed ranks in the compound
alongside the towering Fortress Antonia in the military-ruled colony
of Judea.
   Orders for the covert midnight arrest of the Galilean agitator,
Jesus, had come directly from the Roman procurator, Pontius Pilate.
The company centurion slapped his ``vitus'' staff of command against
his leg. Lanterns on the wall cast flickering streaks on the
cobblestones and the helmets and bucklers worn by scores of men.
   It seemed an unnecessarily heavy force to deploy for seizing this
single hinterlands rabbi. One biblical account says an entire Roman
``cohort,'' 600-strong, was involved, although such designations
were commonly applied to units short of a full complement. Some
scholars believe a smaller contingent, perhaps reduced by the
centurion's assessment of the situation, assembled that night.
   The officer certainly didn't want a massed parade through the
incendiary city of Jerusalem. ``Column of twos!'' he ordered. The
men shuffled into a thinner line for the road.
   Then he waited. Leaders of the adjoining Jewish temple had agreed
to provide an informant to lead the troops to the Galilean's
nighttime camp.
   Cooperation of these Sadducean oligarchs served handily in
controlling this unruly Judean province. Their collaboration was
assured by the appointive authority Pilate wielded over them.
   Rome had ousted four high priests before finding a sufficiently
compliant one in the current officeholder, Caiaphas.
   Ancient, non-canonical Christian writings describe a flow of
messages between him and Pilate. But their liaison had to be kept
secret to avoid inflaming the populace.
   Once, when word slipped out that Caiaphas was supplying funds to
Pilate from the temple treasury to build an aqueduct, an angry
throng jammed the plaza beside the fort and temple.
   They were outraged that sacrificial tithes of shekels would be
diverted to the heathen Roman oppressor. Bad enough were the
empire's commercial levies, paid in Roman money. But diverting holy
funds to pagan purposes seemed utter profanation.
   To quell the upheaval, Pilate had ordered 400 soldiers, four
centuries, to mingle among the demonstrators disguised as Jewish
civilians but armed with swords and clubs hidden under their cloaks.
   At his signal, they laid on. Amid cries and moans, a ``great
number'' were slain, many ``trodden to death,'' while ``others ran
away wounded,'' recounts the ancient historian Josephus.
   Another time, Pilate had a 120-horse wing of cavalry ambush a
procession of singing Samaritans at their holy mountain, slaying and
scattering them wantonly.
   Because of such ruthlessness, Jews customarily spat whenever a
Roman soldier passed. However, this peculiarly crowd-rousing Jesus
apparently didn't hate the military, something the waiting centurion
had learned from fellow officers.
   The story had come from Capernaum in Galilee where a fellow
centurion was stationed with a small garrison.
   As the account went, the Capernaum centurion's sergeant had
become critically ill. Having heard how the roving Galilean teacher
strengthened the sick, the centurion sought him out.
   ``Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof,'' the
centurion says in Matthew 8. ``But only say the word, and my servant
will be healed. For I am a man under authority, with soldiers under
me.''
   Jesus marveled, telling his men, ``Truly, I say to you, not even
in Israel have I found such faith.'' He added something about
sustaining people of all kinds, east and west, and told the
centurion, ``Go. Be it done for you as you have believed.''
   The centurion found his sergeant suddenly well again.
   It was an odd case, a Jew powerfully befriending a Gentile, a
Roman devotee to the imperial gods and part of a foreign military
occupation force in a conquered land. A strange beneficence.
   The centurion assigned to arrest Jesus drew his red-tinged cloak
tighter about his shoulders, still waiting for the temple crew. He
had heard another story indicating Jesus even understood the
rudiments of arms.
   As recorded in Luke 14, Jesus observed: ``And what king, going to
encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take
counsel whether he is able with 10,000 to meet him who comes against
him with 20,000?''
   While likely referring to the costs of serving his cause, as
Bible scholars say, it nevertheless showed his practical awareness
of military operations.
   Also, some of his own men bore arms, a puzzling aspect brought
out at his last supper with them. Luke 22 relates that when one of
his men said, ``Look, Lord, here are two swords,'' he said, ``It is
enough.''
   One apostle was a Zealot, member of an anti-Roman revolutionary
faction that vowed, ``No ruler but God!'' Romans called them
``Sicarri'' for the concealed daggers they carried.
   At the iron-grilled gate, the temple functionaries appeared,
clamorous, blustering, a mob. A priest gestured toward a dour-faced
civilian, ``He'll show you the place.''
   The centurion wanted no hubbub, no unnecessary noise, no calling
cadence by his men. ``Route step and keep it quiet.'' They filed
through the gate and circled around the temple as the city slept.
   Its temporary calm was a relief in this turbulent time of
Passover. Disorders had flared like scattered brushfires across the
city, keeping troops double-timing to put down one outbreak after
another.
   Several troublemakers and brigands had been imprisoned, including
an insurrectionist ringleader, Barrabas, captured in a melee
involving fatalities.
   The centurion's detachment moved through the Sheep Gate and down
the trail into the Kidron Valley, overspread with tents of pilgrims,
smouldering camp fires and knots of squatting peasants in low talk.
   The soldiers tracked up the Mount of Olives, their way lit by
flaring torches. At a clearing near an abandoned oil press they
spotted the prey. The informant slouched forward and kissed the
wanted man on the cheek, the agreed signal.
   Temple minions lunged toward Jesus, and one of his men brashly
whipped out a sword, slashing off one man's ear. But Jesus sternly
intervened, ``Put your sword back in its place. For all who take the
sword will perish by the sword.''
   He said he could summon 12 ``legions of angels'' to defend him if
he wanted, but didn't. Amazingly, he restored the dangling ear lobe
and, under the glare of torches, calmly regarded the arresting band.
   ``Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to
capture me? Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and
you did not seize me. But let the Scriptures be fulfilled.''
   The centurion had the man bound and led back across the valley,
another Passover prisoner. It seemed a questionable case, but orders
were orders.

series about Jesus and the role of the military in his arrest and
crucifixion, based on Scripture, historical sources and ancient
non-canonical Christian writings.

   Shortly before dawn, the centurion Longinus began buckling on his
gear. A courier had brought word of an early morning execution. It
smelled of a rush job, apparently timed before the fractious holiday
crowds clogged the streets.
   Some sort of trial was already nearing its conclusion in the
governor's atrium at the fort. The prisoner, Jesus, a hill-country
Jew who captivated the multitudes, had been arrested by a Roman
patrol only last midnight.
   Longinus had been tapped to finish the business. An orderly
fastened the padded bronze greaves around his lower legs and
tightened the thongs holding the protective leather cuirass on his
chest.
   He slipped on the felt-cushioned bronze shoulder pieces, called
``heart guards,'' and drew on his helmet, with its lined cheek
pieces, hinged visor and decorative crest.
   His name isn't specified in Scripture, but ancient writings
identify him as Longinus. Scripture makes clear that his role in
Jesus' final hours keenly troubled him.
   But for the moment, it only seemed puzzling that the military
governor, Pontius Pilate, would be conducting a trial at such an
early hour, after the prisoner had been shuffled about through the
night among Pilate; the high priest, Caiaphas; the Galilean puppet,
Herod, and now Pilate again.
   Longinus had heard reports of the stir this fellow Jesus caused,
the throngs he attracted. His popularity with ordinary people left
both local and Roman authorities apprehensive about how to curb him.
``They feared the people,'' Scripture says. ``They did not find
anything they could do, for all the people hung upon his words.''
   But Pilate, a master of ruthless artifice, and Caiaphas, his
tractable, Rome-sanctioned high priest, had maneuvered to avoid a
public outcry by acting between midnight and the edge of day.
   Longinus recalled the scene a week ago when the Galilean rode
into the city to cheers of an ecstatic throng. ``Hosanna!' they
cried, meaning ``Save us!'' They waved leafy branches, spreading
fronds and garments in front of him.
   ``Son of David! Blessed be he who comes in the name of the Lord,
even the King of Israel! Hosanna in the highest!''
   Next day, Roman sentries in turrets of the fort overlooking the
temple square had watched Jesus' onslaught on the commerce there,
swinging a braided whip, overturning money-changing tables and
merchants' booths, driving out dealers, tourists and guards alike.
   ``My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made
it a den of robbers,'' he thundered.
   Longinus directed a sergeant to turn out a six-man detail in
front of the guardhouse. Before heading there himself, he nibbled
some figs and a chunk of honeyed bread.
   Centurions were career officers, the backbone of the Roman army.
Senior centurions commanded centuries of l00 men, each with 10
maniples, or squads.
   Under the legionary tribunes in charge of 600-man cohorts, the
centurions were responsibile for discipline, drill, inspections,
quartermaster supplies and operations. Efficiency of the Roman
legions depended on them.
   The Roman historian Polybius wrote:
   ``Centurions are required not to be bold and adventurous so much
as good leaders of steady and prudent mind, not prone to take the
offensive or start fighting wantonly, but able when overwhelmed and
hard-pressed to stand fast and die at their posts.''
   Scholars believe four Roman legions were stationed in the
Judean-Galilean province at that time, the 3rd, 6th, 10th and 12th,
each with about 6,000 men at full strength. Each legion included a
cavalry wing, siege weapons, camels for carrying supplies, slingers,
archers and other infantry soldiers. Most were mercenary auxiliaries
recruited from Thrace, Syria, Gaul, Germany and other imperial
provinces.
   Pilate kept the bulk of his forces at his headquarters in the
coastal city of Caesarea. But he regularly brought reinforcement to
Jerusalem for the Jewish Passover, when the annual influx of
pilgrims turned the city into a tinder-box of turmoil and clamor
against the colonial yoke.
   Longinus left his quarters and strode to the guardhouse where his
detail loitered with their legionary ensign, crucifixion tools and
spears, the iron points topping wooden shafts.
   The sound of a flogging floated out from the guardroom, the crack
of the bone-tipped flagellum mingling with the whoops of soldiers as
they roughed up a prisoner, taunting him as king, slapping him about.
   Shortly, three condemned culprits were jostled into the yard, one
of them, Jesus, badly mauled, lacerated and bleeding, a circle of
thorns jammed on his head.
   Longinus winced, but his martial demeanor returned automatically.
He was a professional. An adjutant brought from Pilate's chambers
the execution tags to be hung around the prisoners' necks.
   Two of them were simply stamped ``thief,'' but the third verdict,
for treason, was written out in Pilate's scrawl for Jesus, ``King of
the Jews.''
   Pilate as procurator held the ``jus gladii,'' full powers of
criminal justice. Only he in this restive province could impose
capital punishment. He did so regularly, a common fate for resistant
Jews. For a quarter century, their landscape had been spiny with
crosses.
   Longinus aligned his detail with the prisoners, each carrying a
heavy crossbeam, and moved them off through the Jerusalem streets.
Onlookers trailed the procession, shoving, gawking curiously, as
temple subordinates scoffed and some women wept over the maimed,
weakened Jesus.
   He kept falling under the heavy beam, and Longinus brusquely
conscripted a muscular African onlooker to carry it.
   When they reached the execution site, Golgotha, ``Place of the
Skulls,'' it was still early, only the third hour, 9 a.m., says the
earliest account in Mark. The prisoners were bound to the
crossbeams, thick nails pounded through their wrists. Once the beams
were hoisted by pulleys to the uprights, the convicts' feet were
nailed to the posts.
   The tortuous ordeal stretched on: the shooting bursts of pain,
the convulsions, the straining upward to breathe, the massive
cramps, the writhing limbs. The temple claque jeered, women sobbed,
the thieves screamed and raved. Jesus exhibited stoic grit:
``Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.''
   At the foot of the cross, soldiers threw dice for Jesus' robe.
Longinus allowed it. It was a Roman rule: to the executioner
belonged the ``spoila.''
   At noon, the sky darkened, thunder crashed and a shuddering
earthquake rent the ground. The overcast continued until the ninth
hour when Jesus cried loudly, ``Father, into thy hands I commit my
spirit!''
   He had died in only six hours. Usually, crucifixion took about
l2. A spearman ran him through to make sure he was dead.
   Longinus looked up at him as the sun broke through and a bird
chirped.
   ``Certainly this man was innocent,'' he murmured. ``Truly this
man was a son of God!''

<HEAD>Daphne Zuniga Swats a Fly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amidst all the gore and sticky substances of
``Fly II,'' Daphne Zuniga emerges relatively unscatched with just a
splotch of blood on her forehead.
   She's been just as fortunate throughout her career, starring in
Rob Reiner's romantic comedy, ``The Sure Thing,'' a year after
leaving school and going on to appear in Mel Brooks' ``Spaceballs''
and co-starring with Lucille Ball in ``Stone Pillow,'' a TV movie.
   Zuniga was studying theater at the University of California at
Los Angeles in 1984 when a friend asked her to help read a scene for
an agent, who was impressed enough to sign both women.
   ``I'm tempted to say it was luck but I believe there's a right
time and a right place for everything,'' said Zuniga, a native of
Berkeley, Calif. ``I didn't plan it but I was ready for it. If
you're given the opportunity, you have to take it.''
   In ``Fly II,'' the sequel to David Cronenberg's classic horror
film starring Jeff Goldblum, Zuniga plays the girlfriend of the
original fly's son (Eric Stolz), who suffers from the same disease
that transform him from man to insect.
   ``I'm in love and he's changing into a fly,'' Zuniga shrugged.
``On all sets you have distractions but you multiply that with all
the machines and noises. It took a lot of concentration to get quiet
and focused.''
   Zuniga also recently played a Latin dancer who falls in love with
a Catholic priest (Tom Berenger) in ``Last Rites.'' It was her first
role in a movie in which she had a love scene.
   She said Berenger (``Platoon'') helped her with the awkwardness
of the scene:
   ``He (Berenger) said something which Debra Winger had told him
that helped him in `Betrayal.' She said, `Let's just stay in bed all
day and it will go by quicker.'
   ``Tom was great. I trusted him fully. That's important when
you're so vulnerable, emotionally and physically and for the first
time. It was wonderful. I was very fortunate.''
   Zuniga considers herself fortunate in most of her films. In ``The
Sure Thing,'' which co-starred John Cusack, she was helped by the
sensitive direction of Reiner.
   ``Rob was an actor so there was no problem with communication,
none whatsoever,'' she said. ``He understands about romance and love
and all those feelings very well. I just fully trusted him to bring
out qualities that I wasn't in touch with or didn't remember.
   ``I was worried about being funny enough, but Rob pointed out
that comedy comes from reality.''
   But for Brooks, mastermind of such off-the-wall films as
``Blazing Saddles'' and ``Young Frankenstein,'' comedy comes from
every direction. Zuniga was admittedly nervous about working with a
director whose previous stars included such wacky comedians as
Madeline Kahn and Teri Garr.
   ``My background was in dramatic training and much more realistic.
I really had to trust him and he really helped me find that big
isn't necessarily bad _ in fact it's preferred.''
   She found Brooks to be serious about his work, however, sometimes
running his crew through multiple takes, and had a similar
experience with Ball, discovering that television's zany Lucy
Ricardo was a dedicated professional.
   ``She's very serious about what she's doing,'' Zuniga said. ``She
knows what works for her and I really had to earn her respect. In
the very beginning, she said I looked wonderful but I had to speak
up and express more. I took that as a sign that I wasn't satisfying
her but that wasn't it at all. She was very warm and supportive.''
   Zuniga has long been involved in social causes, accompanying her
mother to anti-war rallies. The actress co-founded Young Artists
United, an organization of Hollywood activists, and is also a member
of CISPES (the Committee in Solidarity With the People of El
Salvador). Her father is from Guatemala and is especially concerned
about human rights in Central America.
   ``My family has been threatened so it's not just an intellectual
commitment, it's something deeper,'' she said. ``My parents not only
cared about issues but expressed it. They were both students and
both were very expressive. They said if you believed in something
you should pursue it.''
   She has certainly been determined to advance her acting career
and is anxious to try as many different roles as possible.
   ``I have been offered a few genre films, special effects movies,
but I really feel like I haven't been typecast because I've played a
real broad variety of parts.
   ``I'm just reading scripts and would like to do something more
down to earth, where my leading man stays a human being through the
whole thing.''

   In reactors, radiology departments and research
labs, workers at the end of the day cast off gloves and other
discards whose radioactivity, though relatively mild, requires
careful disposal. Now, with federal prodding, states are acting to
find new ways of getting rid of mountains of low-level nuclear
waste. Associated Press reporters have looked at the leaky legacy
and uncertain future of the disposal process. Here, they examine the
complexities of dealing with potentially lethal leftovers and how
rural Nebraskans reacted to the possibility of a dump site in their

   Picture a football field piled with radioactive
gloves, rags, papers, research animal carcasses, bandages, tools,
filters and stuff that makes exit signs glow. Then picture it piled
500 feet high.
   That's 22.5 million cubic feet of low-level nuclear waste, all of
it generated since 1980 when Congress essentially got out of the
radioactive rubbish business and told the states: You make it, you
take it.
   ``Waste is something that's undesirable or else they would call
it gold. It's an intruder,'' said Marvin Resnikoff of the
Radioactive Waste Campaign, which opposes the new sites. ``People
don't want waste in their backyard.''
   Low-level waste is everything that isn't spent fuel or the
leftovers from the making of nuclear bombs.
   About 90 percent of the volume and 97 percent of the
radioactivity comes from power plants and industrial sources. Other
stuff comes from research labs, hospitals and medical centers that
use radiation as treatment.
   Most of the slop becomes innocuous in a short time, but iodine
129 has a half-life of 16 million years, and technetium 99 will lose
half its potency in 212,000 years. Other potent elements include
cesium 137, strontium 90, cobalt 60 and carbon 14.
   The key date in the new national policy is Jan. 1, 1993, when
states must take title to their own garbage and the only three
commercial repositories will close their gates to states outside
their regions.
   Congress encouraged states to save money and headaches by banding
together in regional compacts. To date, nine compacts including 41
states have been formed. Five states are going it alone and the rest
remain unaligned.
   Experts say 14 new sites are more than are necessary. The cost of
building and operating 14 sites for 30 years would be $2.2 billion
to $5.4 billion, according to a U.S. Department of Energy report to
the Congress last year.
   Three or four sites could do the same job, according to the
Electric Power Research Institute.
   ``It's three times more than enough,'' said Ed Helminski,
publisher of the Radioactive Exchange, a Washington, D.C.,
periodical that focuses on nuclear issues.
   ``It's politics. Nobody wants nuclear waste,'' said U.S. Rep.
Butler Derrick, D-S.C., who co-authored the low-level waste laws.
``It's a matter of the states not wanting to act and wanting to dump
on someone else.''
   Congress got involved in 1980 after the governors of South
Carolina, Nevada and Washington said they would close sites in their
states. Concerned about poorly packed containers and trucking
accidents, they balked at being the nation's dumping ground.
   Three other sites closed by 1978 and have since leaked radiation.
They are at Maxey Flats, Ky., Sheffield, Ill., and West Valley,
N.Y., which environmentalists called ``kick and roll'' dumps because
drums were kicked off a truck, rolled into a ditch and covered with
dirt.
   In the past, all wastes were buried. But because of leaks, 11 of
the 14 new repositories will limit or ban burial. They will shield
wastes in concrete burial vaults or above ground clusters that will
be mounded with layers of dirt.
   ``There were some problems with past practice,'' said Steve
Romano of US Ecology, Inc., which buried wastes in Illinois and
Kentucky. ``Cardboard boxes and crates were thrown haphazardly into
a trench. Let's move on from that and prevent it from happening
again.''
   Annual waste generation hit a peak of 3.77 million cubic feet in
1980, fell to 2.7 million cubic feet in 1985 and dipped to 1.43
million cubic feet last year, according to the U.S. Department of
Energy.
   ``It has to go somewhere. We can't drown in our own waste,'' said
Douglas Eldridge, general counsel of the New York Low-Level
Radioactive Waste Disposal Facility Siting Commission.
   Not counting transportation, states pay about $50 per cubic foot
of waste. The compact price will rise to $100-$300 per cubic foot,
according to Brian Farrell, program manager on low-level wastes for
the Edison Electric Institute.
   Some fear high costs could encourage illegal dumping.
   ``It's desirable to keep generating costs low enough to provide
significant incentive against midnight dumping,'' said Malcolm Knapp
of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   Even if the high-tech graveyards improve safety, danger won't be
altogether eliminated, according to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, which projects an additional 4.4 fatal cancers
over 10,000 years for each low-level waste site of 250,000 cubic
meters. There are 500,000 annual cancer deaths from normal causes.
   To keep exposures low, sites limit the amount of the hottest
material they take in.
   A fence to keep out intruders for 100 years is required at each
site, and the most-contaminated wastes must either be buried deeper
or shielded with concrete for 500 years. By then, the radioactivity
should pose no health risk, although no one is sure if concrete will
keep its integrity that long.
   ``There are parts that can kill you if you're exposed to them,''
said Diane D'Arrigo of Nuclear Information and Resource Service.
``If we're going to produce waste, we should be responsible to
future generations who are going to suffer the consequences.''
   Opponents of nuclear dumps are so upset they've brought buckets
of tar and feathers to town meetings and created uproars.
   ``Michigan is like a sponge sitting in a bathtub. We're
surrounded by 95 percent of the fresh surface water supply in the
country,'' said Ellen Beal of Don't Waste Michigan. ``Who would
think of something so stupid as to put a nuclear dump here?''
   Jeff Dewan, a guitarist and carpenter in Hays, Kan., wrote
``Talkin' Rad Waste Blues'' that's a hit song among nuclear foes in
Kansas and Nebraska. Some lyrics:
   ``I said, say, mister, where you from?
   ``You must think I'm pretty dumb.
   ``That stuff you're peddlin's nuclear trash.
   ``And we don't want your cold, hard cash.''
   To make a repository more acceptable, Nebraska and Illinois will
offer $1 million a year to the town that takes it. Pennsylvania also
plans payments so the host town can attract other industries, which
critics say amounts to a bribe.
   ``It's not a bribe,'' said James Neal of US Ecology, the company
hired to select a site in Nebraska. ``It's an incentive like a tax
break, free land or free services.''
   The state making the most headway is California, where a
repository may be open in 1991 in the Mojave Desert.
   The area gets 6 inches of rain a year and the groundwater is 700
feet below the surface. It's so dry, tracks remain from Gen. George
Patton's armor drilling for World War II battles.
   Fences are needed to keep out the desert tortoise, but for the
most part, the repository is accepted because it will bring 15 to 20
jobs.
   ``It's going to be worth several million dollars worth of goods,
services and wages,'' said Larry DeAtley, former president of the
Chamber of Commerce in Needles, 23 miles from the site. ``It's not a
smokestack. It's not coal dust. It's a safe, non-polluting industry
that will pay good wages and be an asset to our community.''

<TEXT>
   In a backroads town where being a good
neighbor is as important as church on Sunday, the prospect of a
nuclear waste dump has spawned an economic boycott and discordant
civic meetings. It's pitted friend against friend.
   In January, Boyd County, a sparsely populated agricultural area
on the South Dakota border, became one of three semifinalist sites
in Nebraska for a low-level radioactive waste dump.
   ``It's the most tragic thing that's ever happened here,'' said
Lowell Fisher, a third-generation rancher who's chairman of the
``Save Boyd County Association.''
   ``We're not anti-nuke kooks, we're not a bunch of political
activists, we're babes in the woods when it comes to trying to stop
this. But we live in God's country and we don't want everybody
else's garbage.''
   Fisher's group has garnered 1,107 signatures against the dump.
About 3,000 people live in Boyd County, and 1,499 voted in the last
general election.
   But J.C. Marcum, a retired Spencer veterinarian who heads
``People For Progress In Boyd County,'' is delighted the dump might
be located within 12 miles of his home.
   ``Outside rabble rousers have teamed up with local kooks to
coerce people into being against the waste site,'' said Marcum.
``These farmers don't read very much, they aren't educated on the
issue. They think their property values will be lower, but in fact
they'll be higher, and we may get as many as 40 new jobs out of it.''
   He criticized the dump opponents for boycotting businesses owned
by supporters. ``People I've known for 35 years won't speak to me,
but that doesn't bother me. I've got a thick hide.''
   About $2 million will be spent this year to study surface and
ground water, geology, topography, and environmental resources of
320 acres in Boyd County, along with similar acreage in two other
semifinalist counties: Nuckolls on the Nebraska-Kansas border, and
Nemaha on the Nebraska-Iowa line near the Missouri River.
   The dump is designed to be an above-ground reinforced concrete
vault capable of storing five million cubic feet of waste. Its
lifespan will be 30 years or full capacity, whichever comes first.
Radioactive refuse will be trucked in from five states.
   The semifinalist sites, picked in January, resulted from a
months-long winnowing process. Eighty communities at first expressed
interest in the dump's potential jobs and fees _ an estimated $40
million over three decades for local and state government _ but
eventually almost all declined: Not in my backyard.
   A dead black cat in his mailbox caused a Webster County
commissioner to switch his vote from favoring to opposing the site
in his county. Letters to the editor got bitter and personal.
   ``As long as our governor (Kay Orr) and state oppose the right of
the people to vote on the waste site being placed in their county,''
wrote Fisher, ``strife will only increase.''
   Federal law mandates that every state have a dump for its
low-level radioactive garbage _ mostly tools, clothing and resin
from nuclear power plants _ by Jan. 1, 1993. Most states are banding
with others in regional disposal compacts.
   Nebraska voted against hosting the Central Interstate Compact
dump, but was outvoted by Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana,
who argued that Nebraska ranked highest in generated waste and
environmental suitability.
   A referendum which would have made Nebraska the first state to
pull out of a compact was defeated by a nearly 2-to-1 margin last
November. The citizens' group that placed the issue on the ballot
raised only about $25,000 to get its message across, compared to the
$1.5 million spent to defeat the measure by the utility industry.
   Political analysts believe ads warning that power plants could be
shut down and hospitals might cut back radiological treatments if
the initiative passed prompted many ambivalent voters to keep the
compact.
   When Initiative 402 was rejected, US Ecology, Inc., the company
chosen in 1987 by the compact to find a site and build and operate
the dump, forged ahead. The Louisville, Ky.-based firm disposed of
nearly half the nation's commercial low-level radioactive waste in
1987.
   But US Ecology's track record is a major cause of concern to
Nebraska's dump opponents because two of its now-closed low-level
radioactive waste sites leak.
   Vice President Richard Paton vows US Ecology is committed to
building a state-of-the-art dump in Nebraska on a site that will
meet or exceed public health and safety requirements.
   ``No one can make guarantees about the future,'' said a US
Ecology handbook distributed to Nebraskans, ``but through the
judicious selection of a site that meets or exceeds the siting
standards, and the concept of multiple engineered barriers built
into our design, the situation that occurred at below-ground
disposal facilities built in the 1960s are very unlikely to occur at
the Nebraska facility.''
   The compact commission delegated siting to US Ecology ``so it
would be decided on technical merit,'' rather than politics, said
Dennis Grams, director of Nebraska's Department of Environmental
Control, adding that his agency would ensure that US Ecology meets
regulations.
   ``This process would have been a lot easier for us if the areas
had been designated by the state or federal government,'' said US
Ecology's Paton, ``but I believe the controversy will die down when
we show we are not out there to try and do harm. ...''
   Even so, he acknowleged he's been threatened. One caller warned,
``We'll take you out feet first.''
   In acquiescing to host the radioactive facility, Gov. Orr imposed
10 conditions on the compact commission, including ``assurances that
the developer will not locate the facility in a community without
the community's consent.''
   But faced with a groundswell of opposition in Boyd County, a
growing anti-dump coalition in Nemaha County, and the potential for
resistance in Nuckolls County, the governor said in mid-January
there would be ``a great danger'' in letting voters decide whether
to approve the site in their own county.
   Legislators, she said, will have to define ``what constitutes
support by the people of that area.'' Two bills requiring voter
approval in the county eventually chosen for the site are pending in
the Legislature.
   US Ecology estimates it will be 12 to 18 months before a final
dump site is picked. Opponents promise to fight on.
   Hugh Kaufman, a government whistleblower who's currently
assistant to the director of the hazardous waste site control
division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, spoke as a
private citizen during a meeting in Nemaha County.
   ``This region of the United States is being singled out as the
new major dumping area for America,'' said Kaufman. ``The nuclear
and toxic waste industry is looking around for more naive
governments and officials who don't know how to deal with it.''
   Lowell Fisher believes all three Nebraska counties were picked as
potential sites ``because we're rural and sparsely populated, have
low incomes, are mostly above middle age, politically conservative,
free market-oriented, have a high school education or less, and
staunchly patriotic.''
   ``But we're not stupid,'' added Fisher, surrounded by anti-dump
paperwork scattered on the kitchen table of his farmhouse. ``We've
got a lawyer, we're raising money, and we're getting smarter every
day.''

   Since low-level radioactive waste dumps moved in
nearby, two communities have had opposite relationships with their
nuclear neighbors. In Sheffield, Ill., there have been lawsuits and
worries. In Beatty, Nev., the dump is called a good neighbor.

<TEXT>
   This gray Illinois prairie has been home
to coal and crops, but it was something alien in the soil that gave
rise to 10 years of litigation and a legacy that could linger for
centuries.
   Deep in the earth among tons of waste in a long-closed dump, a
radioactive substance called tritium is leaking from dirt trenches
in which it was buried.
   Though experts say this form of hydrogen from nuclear power
plants, factories and research labs isn't enough to pose any danger,
the leak illustrates the potential risks of such dumps.
   ``Nobody knows how to safely bury hazardous waste for the length
of time the waste will be hazardous,'' argues Hugh Kaufman, a
government whistleblower who now works at the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. ``It's all supposition and prayer.''
   Others say the industry has come a long way since the late 1960s,
when the low-level nuclear waste dump opened in Sheffield. Still,
scientists concede that while tests to determine the suitability of
the Sheffield area were considered sufficient then, they'd be
terribly inadequate by current standards.
   ``In the mid-'60s, not much was known about the regulation of
low-level waste disposal,'' said Dave Ed, senior nuclear scientist
at the Illinois Department of Nuclear Safety. ``We've learned an
awful lot in 20 years. We've learned before you OK a site ... you
should do a very thorough investigation. We've learned it after the
fact in Sheffield.''
   ``By today's standards, that site shouldn't or wouldn't be
used,'' said Ed, noting the soil is too sandy and gravelly, allowing
water to move distances in six months that experts originally
thought would take hundreds of years.
   Ed says the dump has a mixed record.
   ``It didn't contain the radioactivity as predicted,'' he said.
``But it continues to isolate the radioactivity from people.''
   That doesn't satisfy local activist Stanley Gingrich, who heads a
citizens group that has opposed the dump as well as an adjacent one
filled with non-nuclear hazardous waste that is also leaking.
   ``It has to be one of the biggest blights in this country,'' he
said.
   Even those who believe the operators were conscientious say it
doesn't do a community any good to be near two leaking dumps.
   ``It's definitely been a deficit to us,'' said businessman Bob
Sprowls, adding, ``Like anybody else, I don't know what's out there.
... I'm not smart enough to know what the real danger is.''
   The 20-acre dump, located about 3{ miles from this west-central
town of 1,100, is in a former strip mining area now dotted with
farms.
   It holds about 3.3 million cubic feet of low-level radioactive
waste, including contaminated tools and clothes from hospitals and
nuclear power plants, 100 pounds of plutonium and uranium and parts
of a dismantled nuclear reactor _ all buried in 22 trenches.
   The dump was closed in 1978 when the state refused to allow the
operators, then Nuclear Engineering Co., to bury waste in a new
trench. The state said tritium, which also is used in most modern
bombs, was leaking and the ground was too sandy.
   Nuclear Engineering decided to leave.
   The company ``put the keys to the gate on the table in one of the
sheds and sent us a telegram saying, `We have finished our work at
the site. Since you own it, it's yours again,''' said Clifford
Weaver, a private attorney who represented the state.
   The state filed a $97 million lawsuit, charged the company had
broken its 99-year lease. A judge ordered the company, which in 1981
became US Ecology, Inc., to remain there until trial.
   A decade later, an out-of-court settlement was reached. US
Ecology will commit more than $8 million to test, monitor and
maintain the area, remain there until 1998 and build a new
4{-foot-thick clay cover over the dump.
   State officials insist the agreement is fair. Gingrich disagrees.
   ``We think our community was sold out not having any input in
that settlement,'' he said. ``Eight million dollars and they're able
to walk away in 10 years. ... We think $8 million is peanuts to take
care of that site.''
   As part of the 1988 agreement, US Ecology also purchased a
170-acre buffer zone and built a fence around it after it was
discovered tritium had moved beyond the dump into nearby groundwater
and a lake.
   That angers Gingrich. The state's ``Band-Aid has been to allow
them to buy more property where it's leaking,'' he said. ``We can't
say there's devalued land next to it because they bought the land.
... It can move to the end of town and they can continue to buy the
land. Can they buy the town eventually?''
   But Ed says the land has been thoroughly studied and experts feel
the leak can be contained within the buffer zone until the
radioactivity decays. Most, he said, will be gone within 100 years.
   Ed also said the highest levels of tritium, which leaked because
earthen covers didn't prevent rain from seeping into the radioactive
material, is only 10 percent of the maximum the government allows to
be released to unrestricted areas.
   ``The levels we're talking about you can't build bombs,'' he
explained, noting the same was true of the plutonium, which is
thoroughly dispersed.
   However, the plutonium and uranium will remain hundreds of years,
and though it's unlikely they'll move, people must be prevented from
digging into the waste. ``The site has to be monitored and
maintained for a hundred years at least,'' he said.
   Though one legal battle is over, a 9-year-old lawsuit is pending
over US Ecology's 45-acre non-nuclear hazardous waste site.
Chemicals are leaking from the 4.3 million cubic feet of waste, and
some of the chemicals have apparently mixed with the tritium.
   US Ecology also is spending more than $1.3 million to study the
scope of that problem and seek remedies.
   Meanwhile, the company started holding community forums last year
to keep the town informed of its work.
   ``The site is a mystery to a lot of people,'' said Mark Cade, the
site's post operations manager. ``The word radioactive puts
everybody on guard. ... By being more open than we had in the past,
it would give them an opportunity for a better understanding of what
goes on out there.''
   ``They're trying to communicate more than they used to,''
confirmed Mayor Jack Weber. ... (Before) they did things they didn't
tell us about. ... The public relations is better now.''

<DATELINE>BEATTY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They had a good laugh down at the Sourdough
Saloon when an anti-nuclear activist claimed that Beatty's
radioactive waste dump had turned the place into a ghost town.
   ``She must have been a ghost when she walked through here,'' bar
owner Dick Sorenson said the other day while perched on a stool.
``This ain't no ghost town. We're having the biggest boom Beatty's
ever seen.''
   The economics of this thirsty little desert town near Death
Valley are suddenly of interest as a 1993 deadline nears for states
to dispose of their own low-level radioactive waste. Under a
schedule set by Congress, most states have formed regional compacts
and now are seeking places to put their dumps.
   The debate that follows any specific site proposal often turns to
Beatty, which for 27 years has been neighbor to the nation's oldest
low-level radioactive waste dump, one of only three in the country.
   Beatty, pop. 1,500 or so, is a way station in the desert 115
miles north of Las Vegas. It's a one-traffic-light town, where
chickens scratch in the dusty side roads and everyone seems to know
everyone else.
   The dump, 11 miles south of town, has caused its share of
problems _ mismanagement and accidents there in the 1970s helped
build support for the regional compacts.
   But don't expect to hear Beatty residents bad-mouth their nuclear
neighbor. For one thing, people would rather talk about the new gold
exploration near town _ that's why motels are filled most nights,
they say, and why new buildings are going up on Main Street.
   For another thing, the dump is seen not so much as a threat but
as an accepted community member. It donates money to the volunteer
fire department and employs 23 local residents.
   ``With most people around here, if it comes down to money or a
little radioactivity, they take the money,'' said Bob Clary, 53, who
came to Beatty 20 years ago.
   Beatty is used to things nuclear. Six miles east of town is the
edge of the Nevada Test Site, home of the nation's nuclear weapons
testing since 1951. Old-timers recall watching the fiery mushroom
clouds, and newer residents talk of shocks from underground testing.
   When Nuclear Engineering Co. opened the low-level radioactive
waste site in 1962, relations were friendly between townspeople and
dump workers.
   Too friendly, it turned out.
   If you wanted a wall clock, for example, the dump was the place
to get it. A worker there would pry open a box of radium-dial ship's
clocks slated for burial and sell you one cheap.
   Trying to be good neighbors, dump managers lent out equipment,
such as a radiation-tainted cement mixer, for use on construction
projects in town.
   The ``open door'' policy ended in March 1976, when the company
discovered that a cement floor it had helped lay in back of the
Sourdough Saloon was mildly radioactive.
   ``They came in, tore it all up and took it away,'' Sorenson
recalls.
   State health inspectors descended on Beatty, going door to door
with radiation detectors. In five days, they collected thousands of
mildly radioactive items that should have been in the dump: clocks,
watches, compasses, tools, electric motors, and plywood paneling. In
backyards and at ranches outside town, they found 23 metal tanks
that once had contained radioactive waste but had been converted to
septic or water tanks.
   Officials concluded there was no health risk but clamped down on
the dump nonetheless. They closed the site for three months and
fined Nuclear Engineering $10,000.
   The company fired the employees involved and vowed to make
sweeping changes, but it was just the start of the waste site's
troubles.
   In May 1979, a truck carrying tritium, carbon-14, uranium 238 and
iodine 32 caught fire at the site and spread a cloud of radioactive
smoke over the desert. ``Whoever is responsible ought to be hung
from the yardarm,'' said then-Gov. Robert List, though health
officials concluded the accident had posed no health hazard.
   Over the next year and a half, liquid leaked from crates
containing nuclear waste from Michigan, a ``mystery package''
outside the dump turned out to be radioactive, and the bottom
dropped off a barrel containing uranium waste during unloading.
   List and others urged that the site be closed permanently. Joined
by officials in South Carolina and Washington _ the two other states
with low-level radioactive waste sites _ they lobbied Congress to
make each of the 50 states responsible for its own waste.
   Through it all, Beatty residents stuck by their dump, at one
point collecting 500 signatures in favor of keeping it open.
   But opponents prevailed in 1980, when Congress passed the
Low-Level Radioactive Waste Act. Colorado will be the site of a new
regional dump that will accept Nevada's waste after 1993.
   With four years to go until mandated closing, the Beatty dump is
quiet these days. Two to five trucks a week arrive at the dump,
which occupies half of a fenced-in, 80-acre site. The other half
handles hazardous chemical wastes.
   Nuclear Engineering, which changed its name in 1981 to US
Ecology, administers the dump, watched over by a state Health
Division inspector.
   ``The regulations are a lot more stringent than they were in
1962,'' assistant site manager Bob Marchand said recently as he
escorted a visitor around the site.
   Marchand said the dump accepts no radioactive liquids, to reduce
the already slim chance that radiation could seep into groundwater,
which in this arid climate is 350 feet below the surface.
   Nearly 4 million cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste is
buried in the dump's trenches and pits.
   Standing over a closed trench, radiation safety officer Terry
King said the radiation level there was no greater than anywhere in
the surrounding desert. A radiation monitor clipped to his pocket
proved him right.
   Waste today is put into a 50-foot-deep pit and covered with
earth. The huge pit was opened in 1980; it will be just over half
full when the site closes in 1993, Marchand said.
   Despite the accidents of the 1970s, a booklet put out by the
company says the public health has never been threatened.
   ``They run a good tight ship over there,'' said Bill Sullivan,
justice of the peace and chief of the volunteer fire department.
   Several dump workers serve on the fire department, and the
company's expertise in handling chemical wastes has helped the
department respond to accidents that had nothing to do with
materials heading to the site, Sullivan said.
   Sullivan said he understands the concerns of a community
contemplating a new waste site. ``But I would be more concerned
about somebody dumping (contaminated) lab equipment in the city
dump. Can you imagine what things would be like if they didn't have
sites like this?''

<DATELINE>LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Romeo and Juliet romance of a
16-year-old Greek Cypriot schoolgirl and a 17-year-old Turkish
settler has stirred political passions on this divided east
Mediterranean island.
   The love story has underlined the deep-rooted divisions that
plague Cyprus 15 years after Turkey invaded and seized the northern
one-third of the island.
   But it also in its own small way symbolizes hopes of
reunification as leaders of the rival communities try to find ways
to bring them together.
   There was an uproar in the Greek Cypriot south in September when
the Turkish Moslem, Cengis Coksun Seytan, and Alexia Chronia, a
Christian, were married in a widely publicized Moslem ceremony in
the north.
   Alexia was only 15 at the time. She is only the second Greek
Cypriot girl known to have married a Turk since the 1974 invasion.
   Her family is part of a small, isolated Greek community in the
Karpas region of the north following the flight or expulsion of
200,000 Greek Cypriots after the invasion.
   Greek Cypriots were incensed not just that one of their own would
marry a Turk but one of the 50,000 mainland Turks shipped to the
north to increase the Turkish Cypriot population, which is
outnumbered 4-1 by Greek Cypriots.
   The Greek Cypriots demand the withdrawal of all the settlers and
some 30,000 Turkish troops from the north before a settlement can be
reached on reunification.
   Hardline Greek Cypriots alleged the girl had been kidnapped. Some
officers in the United Nations peacekeeping force believe the
hardliners sought to undermine the talks between their political
leaders.
   The Greek Cypriot press angrily demanded action by the U.N.
force, which supervises the living conditions of the Greek Cypriots
left in Karpas, to rescue Alexia. High school students staged
protest demonstrations demanding U.N. action.
   U.N. officers reported they found no evidence of coercion and
that Alexia was happy. Greek Cypriots called that a cover-up.
   Anger was fueled when Turkish Cypriot television, seen in the
south, broadcast the marriage of Cengis and Alexia and announced
that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash had given the couple an
expensive wedding present.
   Greek Cypriot newspapers claimed the marriage was a Turkish
attempt to prove to the world that the mainland settlers were being
assimilated and were even acceptable to Greek Cypriots.
   In February, when Alexia crossed to the south she claimed she had
indeed been kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam before being
pushed into marrying Seytan.
   A few weeks later, Seytan slipped across the so-called Green Line
that divides the island to become a Christian so he and Alexia could
live in the more prosperous south.
   He was immediately arrested and held in jail on charges he had
kidnapped Alexia and entered the republic of Cyprus illegally.
   Alexia then changed her story, saying she had been forced by her
own family to concoct the kidnap story to save them from the
humiliation of her love for a Turk and conversion to Islam.
   ``I'd go to the end of the world to be with him,'' she said of
the curly haired Seytan.
   Seytan said during a brief court appearance: ``I love her. I want
to see her. Why won't they let me?''
   Nonetheless, the Greek Cypriot authorities ruled that he should
be deported as an illegal immigrant. The order is pending.
   Some Greek Cypriots newspapers insist that Alexia's denial of
being kidnapped followed Turkish warnings they would harm her family
still in the north if she told the truth.
   But other newspapers have become sympathetic and urged tolerance.
   ``If these two youngsters are really in love, why don't we accept
the fact and let them live in peace,'' the independent Epikeri
weekly said in an editorial. ``Why do we object so violently and
fight this possibility?''

<HEAD>Forgotten Refugees: The Thousands Who Fled Caucasus Ethnic Violence</HEAD>

   Weeks before a killer earthquake tore
down the homes of a half-million Armenians, the Soviet Caucasus was
already shaken by a tragedy that has left 300,000 other people
without places to live or work.
   Its cause was the distrust and dislike of one people of another.
   First by the hundreds, then by the thousands, Armenians and
Azerbaijanis fled their homes in fear they might become the next
victims.
   The Soviet government appeals to them to return home, but for
many, the fear remains.
   ``I consider that it's better to die here in Yerevan than to try
to live there,'' said Gena Agabekyan, an ethnic Armenian who fled
Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, three months ago.
   Strife between the predominantly Moslem Azerbaijanis and mostly
Christian Armenians broke into the open in February 1988 in a
dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh district of Azerbaijan.
   Armenians, who make up the majority of the district's population,
complained of discrimination under Azerbaijani control, and demanded
annexation with the Armenian republic.
   Violence flared throughout 1988, and 91 people were killed, most
of them in November. That's when the exodus began from both
republics.
   To date, about 141,000 Azerbaijanis have fled Armenia, and
159,000 Armenians have left Azerbaijan, the Soviet Interior Ministry
says.
   The refugees have been all but forgotten in the aftermath of the
Dec. 7 earthquake that killed 25,000 people and left much of
northwestern Armenia in ruins. No international aid has poured in
for the refugees, as it did for earthquake victims, and little help
comes from within the Soviet Union.
   In an attempt to cool tempers in the Caucasus, the name for the
general area between the Black and Caspian seas, and to snuff out
the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute, the Kremlin has placed the region
under its direct control. It has announced plans to pump millions of
rubles into the district to improve schools, services and even
upgrade television broadcasting in the Armenian language.
   But officials acknowledge that they are overwhelmed by the double
tragedies of ethnic flight and earthquake.
   ``If there hadn't been an earthquake, we would have settled
everyone long ago, and everything would be normal,'' Yuri
Khodzhamiryan, a deputy Armenian premier, told a recent news
conference.
   As it did for quake victims, Armenia's government set up a
commission to help resettle refugees. They receive a one-time
payment of 100 rubles ($160) each and have been offered jobs in
rural areas.
   Early on, the Soviet press trumpeted the return of a handful of
refugees to their homes, clearly trying to encourage others to
follow suit. But officials say fewer than a sixth of the refugees
have returned home.
   Meanwhile, those waiting for new jobs and homes are getting
restless.
   Despite a ban on public gatherings, the refugees have massed
regularly on Lenin Square in downtown Yerevan, the Armenian capital.
   On one recent afternoon, Gena Agabekyan and 100 other refugees
complained outside the State Agriculture Committee offices that the
government was refusing to give them jobs or homes.
   Agabekyan, 50, said he was left without a job when he was fired
as a crane operator for the state-run Azerbaijan Film Committee in
Baku ``because I am an Armenian.''
   Even government officials, who usually claim that interethnic
brotherhood prevails in the Soviet Union, acknowledge that the
hostility felt by the neighboring Caucasus peoples for each other
was behind the refugee wave.
   ``People were driven out only because they were of different
nationality,'' Arkady Volsky, the head of a new governing committee
in Nagorno-Karabakh, told the defense newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda.
   Yerevan, a city of 1.2 million people, has become a magnet for
both refugees and people made homeless by the earthquake.
   The Armenian Land Use Institute has set up a refugee placement
center in the city. Its deputy director, Telemak Mutafyan, said
there is no shortage of jobs or housing in Armenia but many refugees
are not willing to adjust to new conditions.
   ``Azerbaijanis left rural areas here, and Armenians come to us
from Baku and Kirovabad and other Azerbaijani cities,'' Mutafyan
said. ``A city man adjusts with great difficulty to a village.''
   Many refugees are staying with relatives in Yerevan, but others
have settled on their own in buildings condemned as unsafe,
according to Mutafyan.
   Ironically, the earthquake may have a silver lining for some
refugees. The Kremlin has ordered that the devastated area be
rebuilt in two years, and thousands of construction workers are
needed.

<HEAD>Industry Optimistic About Farm Economy Rebound</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRINCEVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite last summer's disastrous
drought, tractor dealer Chuck German says the U.S. agricultural
economy is poised for recovery and growth thanks to lessons learned
in the decade-long crisis that gripped the farm belt.
   But German doubts manufacturers' bullish forecasts for strong
sales of tractors, combines and farm implements. He doesn't see a
quick fix, but a gradual improvement largely dependent upon
cooperation from Mother Nature.
   German, 52, is president of German Implement Co. of Princeville,
a community of 1,700 about 20 miles north of Peoria. His experiences
the past 10 years are common among people who sell tractors.
   ``Our last good year was 1979,'' German said. ``Things started
going downhill in 1980 and they really hit a low ebb in 1984. Our
volume that year was half of our 1979 volume.''
   In 1981, German laid off 25 percent of his employees
indefinitely, saying ``it's sad, but it's been a matter of survival
and waiting for things to pick back up.''
   Like most experts, German thought the farming industry was ripe
for recovery last spring as tractor and combine sales started
picking up. But sales eased quickly in the drought that parched the
Midwest.
   Instead, German watched the drought claim three neighborhing farm
equipment dealers. Illinois has lost 1,500 dealers since 1949,
according to the Illinois Retail Farm Equipment Association.
   German survived but had to cut expenses again, just as he did at
the start of the decade when the farm economy soured.
   Now, German said his manufacturers _ Ford Motor Co. and Japan's
Kubota Ltd. _ are telling him to expect big demand in 1989.
   While he agrees farmers need to replace aging equipment, German
doesn't expect any activity in his showroom, which his father opened
in 1940, unless rain falls more regularly than last year.
   ``Farmers are conservative and waiting for moisture,'' he said.
``That's the big factor. My manufacturers are enthusiastic but I'm
not.''
   That's because the farmers who survived the farm crisis are
astute money managers who think long and hard before spending on
average $60,000 for a tractor and $110,000 for a combine, he said.
   Manufacturers, like Deere &amp; Co. of Moline, are upbeat about 1989
prospects. That's partly because Deere enjoyed record earnings last
year of $315 million despite the drought, which produced the worst
year of tractor and combine sales industry-wide since records were
first kept in 1963.
   Deere flourished in the drought by cutting costs, entering joint
ventures with foreign companies and expanding its product line _
especially in the lucrative lawn and garden market.
   The company's diverse array of insurance and financial services
also helped the bottom line.
   Officials at Ford's agricultural machinery unit in New Holland,
Pa., are equally upbeat, claiming they were ``solidly in the black
in 1988 and looking at some good years ahead.'' They decline to
release earnings or sales figures.
   Ford spokesman Gene Hemphill said the company wasn't hurt by the
drought as badly as others because it does not have a high
concentration of dealers in the Midwest, which suffered most from
the drought.
   Case IH of Racine, Wis., was not as lucky as Ford and suffered a
$95 million loss in 1988 on the heels of a $253 million loss in
1987. The company hasn't shown a profit since 1981 but officials
think prospects have improved.
   The company remains bullish about the agricultural equipment
market, said Vickie L. Rickey, Case IH vice president.
   Other signs of an agricultural rebound include low stockpiles of
grain and higher commodity prices, said Emmett Barker, president of
the Farm and Industrial Equipment Institute in Chicago, an
industry-supported think tank.

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With U.S. soldiers watching from guard
towers on the other side of the border, Maj. Kang Sung Nam of the
North Korean army launched a verbal assault on the Americans,
blaming them for dividing the Korean people.
   ``Panmunjom is just a military demarcation line which the
imperialist Americans drew to divide the Korean people,'' Kang told
tourists from Hong Kong during a visit to the snow-dusted truce
village on the border of North and South Korea.
   ``We hope you can go back and tell your people that we Koreans
are longing for reunification.''
   Kang then presented each tourist with a lapel pin depicting two
hands shaking across the Korean peninsula set on a background of the
North Korean flag.
   Although hundreds of thousands of troops from North and South man
the tense 155-mile-long demilitarized zone, Panmunjom is a tourist
attraction for both sides.
   The official North Korean tour of Panmunjom includes the use of a
large-scale model to explain the demilitarized zone that was set up
after the Korean War. It also includes as a visit to one of the
large huts that straddle the demarcation line, where the two sides
have negotiated since the armistice in 1953.
   The North Koreans offer a version of the 1950-53 Korean War
markedly different from that of the South Koreans and Americans, who
fought under the banner of the United Nations Command.
   Visitors are shown a 20-minute documentary accusing the United
States of invading the Communist North, using chemical weapons and
bearing sole responsibility for the peninsula's division. The film
features close-ups of wounded Korean civilians and surrendering U.S.
soldiers.
   The documentary does not mention, however, that it was North
Korea's invasion of the South on June 25, 1950 that set off the war,
nor does it refer to the Chinese who entered the conflict to help
North Korea recover from severe military setbacks.
   Kang repeatedly maintained that at the 1953 truce signing in
Panmunjom, the South Korean representative was unable to speak for
his people because, he said, the negotiations were dominated by the
United States.
   The North and South remain technically at war, with each
government claiming to be the legitimate ruler of all Korea.
   But in recent months, the two sides have been exchanging
proposals on ending the confrontation and Panmunjom, the site of the
latest round of political talks, once again has been the focus of
attention.
   Panmunjom became neutral after the war but has been a symbol of
the division and tension on the peninsula to both North and South.
   The heavily militarized Korean peninsula includes an estimated
850,000 military regulars in North Korean and 650,000 soldiers in
South Korea, supported by a 42,000-member U.S. military contingent.
   But North Korean officials talk as though any hostilities would
come from the South.
   ``The People's Army is here to protect you,'' tour guide Yoon Mu
Ho reassured the tourists as eight North Korean soldiers stood
stiffly at attention at the truce village huts.

<HEAD>Italian Drought Means Higher Prices for Some Foods but Not Pasta</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds, CORRECTS spelling of durum in 4th graf ``Italians ... wheat''
and in 20th graf ``Normally ... 10 tons.'' ^By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GROSSETO, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of nothing but sunshine and
blue skies, rains finally are falling on Italy's parched croplands.
   Some areas had not seen rain in 80 days. In others the rainfall
in the last five months was less than half the average.
   But the new rains may be too late. It will take months to
determine what the drought has done to the wheat crop, fruit and
olive orchards, vineyards, citrus groves and vegetable farms.
   Italians already know it will mean higher prices for some foods
and possibly even for their bottle of wine. However, they may be
saved higher costs for their pasta, which is made from durum wheat.
   ``While until a month ago we were very concerned about the
effects of the drought on the recent harvest, the recent rains have
pretty much calmed our fears,'' said Albino Ganapini, a spokesman
for Barilla, Italy's largest pasta producer. ``If the rainy season
continues normally, as meteorologists are predicting, then we will
have a normal harvest.''
   He said the planting had been increased by 4 percent this year
and noted that Italy normally imports about 25 percent of the wheat
it uses for pasta anyway.
   But farm groups say the drought will mean higher prices for
fruits and vegetables. Producers say the retail price of artichokes,
one of the most popular Italian vegetables, could triple from the
current average price of 900 lire (67 cents) apiece.
   Growers say fruit, olive and citrus trees will produce less this
year because of the drought, which also is expected to diminish the
grape harvest, bringing the prospect of higher prices for wine.
   For some farmers this is the third bad year in the last five of
poor harvests.
   ``I've never seen a drought like this,'' said Alfio Pieraccini,
who has farmed for 50 years on this fertile plain that stretches
toward the Tyrrhenian Sea from the foot of the Tuscan hills.
   Pieraccini said it was too late to recover the cost of planting.
   Agriculture Minister Calogero Mannino recently told a Senate
committee the ministry cannot yet realistically evaluate the damage,
which varies widely from region to region.
   Earlier, the ministry released a preliminary estimate of $1.5
billion. But it said the amount of rain over the next few months
could drastically alter the picture.
   Giuseppe Avolio, the president of the Italian Confederation of
Farmers, said the damage could reach $7.4 billion.
   So far the government has declared only Sardinia a disaster area.
The island has had below average rainfalls for three years and
despite some recent rain, the situation there is still grave. Its
barren fields are unable to support sheep and goats that represent a
third of Italy's herd.
   About 5,000 farmers demonstrated recently in Cagliari, Sardinia's
capital, to demand that the government provide more drought relief
funds.
   The regional government estimates damage in Sardinia alone at a
half billion dollars or more.
   But despite the recent rains, Agriculture Minister Mannino said
other regions in Italy could still be declared disaster areas. The
drought has withered crops from Lombardy in the north to Sicily in
the south.
   Regional officials in Lombardy say the drought might destroy 30
percent of the crops in the region known as one of the most fertile
in Europe.
   Normally the fields on the Pianura di Grosseto, the wide plain in
southern coastal Tuscany, are green with durum wheat by February.
The harvests usually average 40 to 50 metric tons an acre, but this
year farmers expect the average will be no more than 10 tons.
   Farmer Pieraccini of Grosseto, still active at 76, takes his
troubles in stride.
   In 1985 he suffered because of a killer frost that destroyed
olive, fruit and citrus trees as far south as Sicily. Last year,
heavy rain washed away 40 percent of his crop. This winter, at least
70 percent of his wheat has died.
   ``What happens, happens,'' he shrugs.

   Profits from illegal cocaine sales are so vast
these days that government agents measure drug dollars by weight and
cocaine dealers, in a scramble to launder the bulky cash, have even
gone so far as to buy banks.
   ``The cocaine organizations are generating a horrendous amount of
cash,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner.
   ``If they can't convert this cash and get it out of the United
States, the whole point of the illegal drug operation is frustrated.
   ``Most people don't realize the physical space and weight taken
up by cash proceeds... Until it is counted, we are measuring this
money in weight. $1 million in cash is well over 100 pounds of
currency.''
   So drug dealers devise ingenious schemes to get money out of the
country. The arrests of 37 jewelers and their employees has exposed
what authorities say was a clever new mechanism: using bogus gold
transactions to hide drug profits.
   In recent years Bonner's office has prosecuted money-laundering
rings that went so far as to buy their own banks, but nothing has
matched the scope of the ring broken by the federal ``Operation
Polar Cap,'' which allegedly involved whole families as defendants
and more money than any case before it.
   The case broke open Feb. 22 as federal agents searched 85
locations in Los Angeles, New York and Miami and U.S. marshals swept
into Los Angeles' wholesale jewelry mart, arresting proprietors of a
dozen jewelry and bullion outlets.
   Jewelers allegedly laundered more than $1 billion in just over
two years.
   A federal grand jury here indicted 33 jewelers and associates
Wednesday. Four other defendants were indicted in San Jose the
previous week.
   Authorities also confiscated $80 million in property, including
jewelry, $12 million in gold, $6.74 million in cash, a condominium,
apartment complex, five houses and a 10-story building in the center
of the downtown mart.
   ``This investigation certainly will pay for itself,'' Bonner said
at a news conference announcing the indictments.
   According to court documents, the money-laundering operation was
run primarily from Ropex Corp., owned by Wanis ``Joseph''
Koyomejian, and Andonian Brothers Manufacturing Co., owned by Vahe
and Nazareth Andonian. One defendant, Raul Vivas, is in custody in
Uruguay, from where he allegedly ran the ring.
   The defendants were charged with aiding the distribution of
thousands of pounds of cocaine by laundering hundreds of milllions
of dollars in cash from drug sales across the country. They also
were charged with conspiringto violate the Money Laundering Control
Act and to avoid reporting currency transactions over $10,000 as
required by law.
   The maximum sentence for conspiracy is life imprisonment. The
maximum for money laundering is 20 years in prison and fines up to
$25 million.
   Most of the defendants are different from any arrested in the
past. Instead of Colombian nationals deep into the drug trade, they
are of Armenian, Syrian, Turkish and Lebanese extraction, emigres
who seemed to have grabbed a piece of the American dream with their
thriving gold and jewelry businesses.
   The defendants, through their lawyers, have declared their
innocence.
   Government officials won't comment in depth on Polar Cap, but
some 300 pages of affidavits show their view of how the gold and
jewelry trade became a nearly perfect cover after the 1986 arrests
of major money-launderers.
   According to affidavits, here's how one gold-related transaction
worked:
   On Dec. 12, 1988, nine boxes of cash _ $2,568,000 _ were shipped
from Z&amp;G Gold in New York by armored car to Andonian Brothers in Los
Angeles, where it was counted and phone calls were made confirming
the amount.
   The next day, Nazareth Andonian ordered 177 kilograms of gold
credited to a gold brokerage account of Ronel Refining of Hollywood,
Fla., a gold refining company, and deposited the $2,568,000 in a Los
Angeles bank.
   He later wire-transferred $2,491,152 to Ronel, keeping $76,848 as
ABI's 3 percent commission for laundering. Ronel owner Richard
Ferris used the money to pay for the gold, keeping a 4 percent
commission. At that point, according to an affidavit, ``Ronel is
positioned to repeatedly sell the same gold to API-LA via various
gold brokers.''
   Cash was delivered daily by drug couriers to about a dozen
jewelry stores in New York and Los Angeles, then transported to ABI
or Ropex for counting and deposit under the guise of gold sales, the
government said. Millions then were transferred to banks in Panama
and Uruguay for delivery to Colombia as payment for cocaine that had
been shipped on consignment to the United States.
   ``The amount represents proceeds of approximately 70 tons of
cocaine sold in the United States in two years,'' Bonner said.
   The scheme worked without detection until early last year, when
incidents on two continents led fed   The play is Brooks' first writing
for the theater. He composed
the music for the films ``Marjoe,'' ``The Garden of the
Finzi-Continis'' and ``The Lords of Flatbush,'' and has written over
140 advertising jingles, mostly for television.
   ``I grew up in Manhattan loving all the old standards:
`Carousel,' `Oklahoma!' They all had tremendous melodies; that's
what I've tried to do.''
   But the initial appeal of ``Metropolis'' may well lie in its
scenery, which takes up one-third of the musical's budget. Its
massive gray-and-black, pipe-filled sets evoke an oppressively cold,
mechanistic environment populated by two worlds _ the underground
one of the two lovers and the elitist one ruled by the evil inventor
(Freedman).
   Brooks and his colleagues dispute suggestions that ``Metropolis''
is another British techno-spectacle such as ``Cats'' and ``Starlight
Express.''
   ``If ever a show required a big visual statement, it's this
one,'' said Ralph Koltai, the Hungarian designer responsible for the
ill-fated ``Carrie'' and a frequent collaborator at the Royal
Shakespeare Company. ``You couldn't do `Metropolis' on an empty
stage with a chair.''
   Judy Kuhn, who makes her West End dbut as the saintly Maria,
said: ``This show is about machines; it's about what man has created.
   ``As long as technology helps the show, it's OK. It's technology
for its own sake that's the problem.''

<HEAD>Richard Chaves Fights Martians on `War of the Worlds'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   One more thing to worry about: The invading
Martians are still with us and determined to take over Earth in
``War of the Worlds.''
   Reports of their destruction during Orson Welles' famous radio
re-creation of the H.G. Wells classic ``War of the Worlds'' on
Halloween eve in 1938 or in George Pal's 1953 movie were premature.
   Leading the fight against the alien invaders is Lt. Col. Paul
Ironhorse, played by Richard Chaves in Paramount's syndicated TV
series ``War of the Worlds.''
   ``Ironhorse is the head of the Special Forces,'' said Chaves. ``I
describe him as being able to fly anything that can fly, drive
anything that can move and shoot anything that can shoot. He's a
hard-charging spit and polish soldier, but he's changing.
   ``He's changing mainly in the direction of his Indian heritage.
At West Point he had to shed his Indian heritage. Now, he's becoming
more sensitive. He's going to need the instincts and special skills
of his Indian ancestors.''
   In the TV series, the aliens have been in suspended animation
since their defeat in the 1953 movie. But accidental exposure to
radioactive waste revives them and sends them off again on their
mission to wipe out human life and prepare Earth for alien
colonization.
   The hour-long series also stars Jared Martin, Lynda Mason Green
and Philip Akin. It is a sister syndicated series to Paramount's
``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and ``Friday the 13th: The
Series.''
   H.G. Wells' ``War of the Worlds'' was a Victorian classic that
became a granddaddy of science fiction in 1897. Paramount purchased
the film rights in 1925 for director Cecil B. De Mille. For nearly
30 years the script passed through many hands until it reached
producer George Pal. His 1953 production won an Oscar for special
effects and is considered a film classic.
   The series is made in Toronto, where Chaves said he sometimes has
a charcoal heater on each side during outdoor filming. ``I'm hoping
we'll be indoors for at least half of the shows,'' he said.
   Chaves was born in Florida, the son of a Marine Corps officer,
and grew up in warm-weather areas. His father is now a Drug
Enforcement Agency agent in San Diego.
   ``The first TV show I ever did I played a Marine captain,''
Chaves said. ``My father was so proud of me. It was `Eight Is
Enough,' the first thing I ever did.''
   Chaves served in the Army in Vietnam and co-wrote a play about
his experiences, ``Tracers.'' He and eight other veterans wrote and
acted in the play, which won the 1980 Los Angeles Drama Critics
Award for best ensemble and the Theatre World Award for outstanding
new talent. Besides Los Angeles, they presented the play in New York
and London.
   He also starred in ``Vietnam Trilogy'' on the stage and
participated in the Home Box Office special ``Dear America: Letters
Home from Vietnam.'' His last Vietnam-connected role was in the TV
movie ``To Heal a Nation.''
   He also starred with Arnold Schwarzenegger in ``Predator'' and
with Don Johnson in ``Cease Fire.'' The latter was taken from the
third act of ``Vietnam Trilogy,'' in which Johnson played his role
from the stage and Chaves played his best friend. In ``The Gambler
III,'' he played Irondog, a Lakota Sioux.
   ``That role put me back in touch with my Indian heritage,'' he
said. ``Ironhorse was written as a Blackfoot, but I asked to play
him as my own heritage. My mother was part Cherokee, Scottish and
Irish. My father was a full-blooded Castilian from Spain. My
grandparents came from Spain.
   ``This role is perfect timing. It's a role that combines my
Indian background and my military experience. I've been very
fortunate in my career that way.''
   Chaves said when he auditioned for the role in ``War of the
Worlds'' he found that he was up against a close friend, Sonny
Landham.
   ``I called Sonny and he started laughing,'' he said. ``He took it
wonderfully. We've played golf since then. He dropped out of the
competition. I think his price was too high. In my heart I knew I
was meant for this role.''
   Chaves, 37, is unmarried but said he has been close twice. He is
an avid golfer.
   ``Recently I was driving my car and got to thinking,'' he said.
``I played a doctor on `Hill Street Blues,' a lawyer on `Miami Vice'
and an Indian chief on `Gambler III.' I started laughing so hard I
had to pull my car over.''

   Dennis R. Patrick made a simple proposal two
years ago: Let American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. earn as much
profit as it can but cap the annual increases in AT&amp;T's
long-distance rates.
   Patrick said it was time to throw out the 20-year-old
rate-of-return philosophy that had allowed AT&amp;T to earn a certain
percentage above its costs.
   Use price caps, he said, to reward efficiency and create economic
incentives to lower costs _ and save consumers hundreds of millions
of dollars.
   Congress howled and consumer groups said it would lead to
unrelieved price increases.
   But Patrick stood fast, adjusting his plan here and there, and on
Thursday is expected to gain commission approval to implement the
rate cap proposal.
   Congress still could intervene and block rate caps, but Patrick
said he considers the program one of his biggest accomplishments
since he became FCC chairman in April 1987.
   ``I think that the rate cap proceedings ... have been a model in
terms of interaction between the commission and the Congress on an
important issue of public policy,'' Patrick said in an interview
last week.
   ``I think there has developed a consensus that rate-of-return
regulation is flawed and that we need to have incentive regulation.
... I think we have a formula and a process that is going to cap
rates and bring them down faster than what we should anticipate
under rate-of-return regulation.''
   The long-term benefits, he said, would give companies such as
AT&amp;T and, eventually, the seven regional Bell companies, ``an
incentive for the first time to reveal to the federal government how
efficient they can be. Right now those companies have an incentive
to play hide the ball. But if we say to them, `Here's the mark. If
you can beat the mark we'll allow you to keep a little bit more in
the way of profits in the short run, in the long run we're going to
emulate the market and capture those benefits for consumers.''
   His other major accomplishment, he feels, was abolishing the
FCC's 40-year-old Fairness Doctrine that required broadcasters to
present opposing views of controversial issues. The commission,
Patrick said, was ``standing foursquare in favor of more First
Amendment freedoms for electronic journalists.''
   ``I am convinced that the Fairness Doctrine was antithetical to
the purposes for which it was created. In fact it was
counterproductive,'' he said of the commission's August 1987
decision. ``It chilled speech. And on a more fundamental level I
think it is offensive to have the federal government monitoring,
regulating, attempting to balance by and through our subjective
judgments the speech of broadcasters, because broadcasters are
journalists, and journalists are supposed to be free.''
   Congress didn't see it that way, and quickly passed legislation
that made the Fairness Doctrine law. Then-President Reagan vetoed
the bill, but Congress is expected to pass it again this year.
President Bush said on the campaign trail he would veto it.
   Controversy has dogged the 37-year-old former California attorney
since he moved up from being an FCC commissioner to succeed another
friend of deregulation, Mark Fowler.
   ``It is no secret that early on in my administration the
commission was called upon to engage some very tough and very
contentious issues. That strained relations a bit with the Congress
_ or some members. I have since that time remained completely
willing and disposed to communicate with the Congress, to reach
compromises where possible and to move the ball forward on these
various fronts in a cooperative way.''
   At this point, he said, ``Relations, in fact, I think are very
good between the commission and the Congress.''
   But he doesn't apologize for his vigorous deregulatory approach.
   ``I have tried to pursue on the broadcast side of our
jurisdiction policies that reflect our belief in competition, our
belief that competition is the best regulator of licensees _ it is
the restraint mechanism that is most likely to cause broadcasters to
identify and serve the public interest,'' Patrick said.
   At the same time, he also supports a policy that sends chills up
the spines of broadcasters: spectrum auction _ selling licenses to
the highest bidder.
   Although Patrick hasn't proposed that such a plan be adopted for
radio and television station owners or amateur radio or public
safety operations, he, like the Reagan administration, thinks
air-to-ground radio operators, cellular telephone companies and the
like should pay for the airwaves they use.
   ``If the secretary of Interior were to propose tomorrow to give
away (federal) mineral rights or oil rights or grazing rights, or
what have you, he or she would probably be impeached, and yet the
way we pursue communications policy is one wherein we are virtually
directed to give away ... what is arguably one of the most valuable
natural resources we have _ radio spectrum.''
   ``In an era of huge budget deficits it's absolutely absurd that
we give away this resource,'' he said.
   In the long term, he said, he thinks bidding would help the
airwaves to be used in a ``more socially beneficial'' way.
   He said his approach isn't inconsistent with the notion that the
airwaves belong to the public.
   ``If this is a public resource, radio spectrum, which I think it
is, then there ought to be some compensation to the Treasury for the
use of the resource.''
   Patrick acts like a man who enjoys what he does, and he said he
puts in 11 to 12 hours days _ with weekend work not uncommon.
   He said he's a big movie fan, and in warm weather he likes to
play volleyball near the Lincoln Memorial _ perhaps something the
native Californian can't get out of his blood.
   He was born in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale on June 1,
1951, and graduated magna cum laude from Occidental College with a
bachelor's degree in political science.
   He was a 1976 graduate of the Law School at the University of
California, Los Angeles and joined the Los Angeles firm of Adams,
Duque &amp; Hazeltine before going to the White House personnel office
in December 1981. He was named an FCC commissioner in December 1983.
   His term ends on June 30, 1992, but FCC-watchers generally expect
him to leave his $82,500-a-year post this year.
   ``I think it's fair to say that 1992 will not see me in this
position,'' he said. But he said he has no immediate plans to leave
government.
   Patrick said he is ``a great believer in the proposition that the
government should be run by and large by citizens of the republic
that come to government for a while and return to the private
sector. And I think that's good for your perspective as well as your
energy level.''

   People living in ``families'' that don't conform to the age-old
concept of Mom, Dad and the kids are locked in battles in a number
of communities where personal freedom is pitted against the desire
to control who lives next door.
   In some of Denver's most exclusive neighborhoods, for example,
unmarried people can't legally live together under a ``living in
sin'' zoning code. In Poughkeepsie, N.Y., four or more people can't
live in the same rental dwelling if they're not of the same family.
And in Chicago, eight couples in a public housing project got
married late last year to avoid eviction.
   Many communities have laws restricting housing according to
varying definitions of what constitutes a family. The reasons range
from preserving ``quality of life'' in the face of an influx of
outsiders, to cutting backlogs of people waiting to get into public
housing, to fighting drugs.
   Supporters of Denver's 30-year-old code say it encourages strong
family-oriented neighborhoods. ``We should stand up and say we stand
for families and traditional values,'' said City Councilman Ted
Hackworth.
   ``I just do not think it's appropriate for the city to regulate
whether you are married any more than we should regulate whether you
go to church,'' said Councilwoman Cathy Reynolds, who has fought for
13 years to repeal the law.
   Elinor Lewallen, whose neighborhood is covered by the ordinance,
said she opposed it because if her husband were to die, she would be
barred from seeking a live-in companion so she could continue living
in her home.
   The City Council is scheduled to vote on the matter March 27.
   Poughkeepsie, in its ordinance passed last month to keep college
students from overcrowding apartments, defined ``family'' as a group
which ``in theory, size, appearance, structure and function
resembles a traditional family unit,'' cooking together and sharing
expenses.
   ``The local newspapers got it a little confused. They said it
meant that Kate and Allie wouldn't be able to live together, but
that's not right,'' said City Clerk Patricia Havens. ``Kate and
Allie'' is a CBS-TV show in which two divorced women and their three
children share an apartment.
   Delray Beach, Fla., approved an ordinance last August allowing
only one person outside of the immediate ``family'' _ defined as
parents and children _ to live with a family in a single-family
home. City officials say it is meant to curb overcrowding that can
lead to increased garbage and noise, traffic congestion, and health
and safety problems in neighborhoods.
   As of last month, officials had cited 11 homes _ all owned by
Haitians.
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida is deciding on a
challenge, said attorney Jim K. Green of the Palm Beach County
chapter of the ACLU.
   Tamarac, Fla., officials temporarily tabled a similar ordinance
after the ACLU threatened action. The proposal said no more than
three unrelated people, and no more than five foster children, could
live in a single-family home.
   ``We're creating a recipe for more homelessness,'' said Broward
County ACLU attorney Larry Corman.
   Many housing authorities prohibit unwed couples in public housing.
   In Woonsocket, R.I., Dana Dagnese and Susan Arsenau, who have
lived together for six years and are expecting their third child,
filed a lawsuit in January alleging that the Woonsocket Housing
Authority violated their rights to ``freedom of association, family
privacy and equal protection of laws'' by denying them emergency
housing.
   U.S. District Judge Ronald R. Lagueux refused last month to issue
a preliminary injunction, saying, ``Here is a couple in an illicit
relationship who are creating children for the welfare rolls, where
others who qualify for housing are shunted aside.'' No trial date
has been set.
   The Chicago Housing Authority banned overnight guests in the
Rockwell Gardens project after a September police raid to combat
gang violence. That meant eight women could not allow their live-in
boyfriends to stay with them without a trip to the altar. The 16
residents _ including one couple with seven children _ were married
en masse in Novemeber.
   In Massachusetts, three couples filed a lawsuit five years ago
charging they were illegally barred from public housing in Worcester
because they were unmarried. State law prohibits discrimination on
the basis of marital status.
   The Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination ruled in
their favor, the Worcester Superior Court upheld that ruling, and
the case is pending before the Massachusetts Appeals Court. The
housing authority contends the law applies to individuals _ for
example, a divorced woman with children _ not couples.
   ``To open up public housing slots to unmarried couples ... would
create such an enormous strain on a system which is already so badly
burdened,'' said Housing Authority attorney Michael Clancy.
   In West Hollywood, Calif., the nation's first city with a gay
majority of city officials, a 1985 domestic partnership ordinance
gives unmarried couples the same rights as married couples.
   ``If you have a domestic partner, you can't be evicted if you
have someone living with you,'' said Deputy City Clerk Vivian
Vukojevich. ``It can be a gay couple or lesbian couple or
heterosexual couple.''
   Sometimes the definition of ``family'' is intended to circumvent
zoning restrictions, as in a bill sought by the Rhode Island
Department for Children and Their Families to protect group homes
from local opposition.
   No legislative action is expected for several weeks on the
measure, which says a department-run group home ``providing
residential care and-or treatment to eight or fewer children
residing out of their natural homes shall be considered a family for
purposes of zoning.''
   And in King William County, Va., 23-year-old twin sisters Kim
Taylor and Cam Porter, Pamunkey Indians, are gathering signatures
from Pamunkey women all over the East Coast to change a tribal law
barring them from the reservation because they both married white
men. Pamunkey men can marry whites.
   Chief William ``Swift Eagle'' Miles, who supports the sisters'
petition, said when they gather what they think are enough
signatures, they can request a tribal council meeting to discuss the
issue.
   Taylor said she wasn't able to marry anyone on the reservation
``because they're all girls or they're my cousins.''

<TEXT>
   Democracy, Gorbachev style, went to
work aboard a Soviet fishing vessel off South America. Its 50
officers and sailors met during a storm to nominate a candidate for
a new national assembly back home.
   Slicing through 40-foot foam-flecked waves, the 18,000-ton Kola
Bay covered 400 nautical miles before its crew could agree on who
they thought should represent them in the halls of power in Moscow,
said first mate Konstantin S. Atroshnikov.
   Democracy, Gorbachev style, pre-empted the movie ``King Kong'' in
the palace of culture of this port city 1,000 miles north of Moscow,
famed as the destination of the World War II Allied convoys carrying
guns and Spam to the embattled Soviets.
   In snow-coated Kirov Palace, where on other days the great ape
had roared on the screen, more than 700 delegates from city
workplaces and neighborhoods gathered to whittle down the list of
candidates to be proposed to voters. It took them nine hours to pare
the list of six names to three.
   With passion and skepticism, a modest measure of ballyhoo and a
big dose of confusion, this city of 440,000 and the Soviet Union at
large are experiencing their first nationwide election campaign
where voters will be allowed a choice, instead of having a single
candidate put up by the Communist Party.
   ``I'm running because the law now gives me that right, and I want
to state my positions,'' said one Murmansk candidate, Andrei A.
Zolotkov, an engineer who has worked on nuclear-powered icebreakers.
``That's my only goal.''
   Said the chief of Murmansk's Communist Party apparatus, Vladimir
P. Khachenko: ``In the past, we used to gather in committee and say:
`How many women candidates do we need here, or how many workers
there?' This time not a single candidate has been endorsed by the
city (party) committee.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who championed the
multi-candidate elections, calls the exercise a ``school of
democracy.'' He says Soviet political life must be opened to greater
citizen participation if his program for ``perestroika'' (social and
economic change) is to succeed.
   That's the theory.
   In practice, there are clear signs of pressure from the party in
some sections of the country, like the conservative Ukraine, to have
a party-backed candidate become the voter's sole option in the
elections March 26 for the newly created Council of People's
Deputies.
   The electoral changes, approved in December by the Soviet
parliament, also create what some Soviets call ``filters'' at
several levels to block candidates who can't garner majority support
on nominating panels.
   One famous victim of the ``filters'' was Andrei D. Sakharov, the
dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, whose candidacy was not
backed by the Academy of Sciences. The choice of the Kola Bay's
crew, the captain of another fishing boat, never made it through a
subsequent nominating meeting held by representatives of Sevriba,
the enterprise that runs the Kola Bay and more than 70 other
Murmansk-based fishing vessels.
   Bungling by Murmansk's election commission also blocked a
candidate nominated by more than 100 boats, representing 20,000
fishermen and their families, from making the final list. Pravda,
the Communist Party newspaper, accused Murmansk's election
commission Wednesday of misinterpreting the law by ruling that only
Sevriba, and not each of its ships, had the right to propose
candidates.
   Due to the commission's error, Irina A. Rogachev, an economics
professor, will not get to run for office. Pravda said a storm of
political discontent is brewing in Murmansk.
   As a result of the meeting in late February at the culture
palace, voters in Murmansk's Territorial Election District No. 224
will choose on March 26 from among a doctor, the chief of a fishing
trawler fleet, and the 37-year-old Zolotkov.
   What's emerging in their fledgling campaigns is a pronounced
accent on local issues, such as the lack of housing that's keeping
50,000 Murmansk residents waiting for better apartments; the
rationing of sugar, sausage and other staples; the lack of
polyclinics in new neighborhoods, and the fouling of the environment
by industry in this once pristine region north of the Arctic Circle.
   Zolotkov's nine-minute speech at the Kirov Palace never mentioned
Gorbachev but detailed the problems of his fellow city dwellers and
had a distinct ``let's send a message to Moscow'' tone.
   ``When you're talking about people's lives, you must make
demands,'' he declared.
   According to Khachenko, there's little if any difference in the
candidates' platforms: ``What people want is a deputy with courage
who will fight for what he believes in.''
   What's also becoming apparent in Murmansk is a clannishness, or
splitting along professional lines.
   ``The city's doctors are campaigning for the doctor and are in
the street passing out leaflets,'' Khachenko said. The captain,
meanwhile, has surrounded himself with other captains.
   A local editor, Viktor V. Prostikhin, is trying to shake off
attempts by Murmansk's electoral commission to force his Arctic Star
newspaper, run by the Murmansk Shipping Company, to give equal space
to other candidates besides Zolotkov, a shipping company employee.
   ``That's pressure on the press,'' Prostikhin maintained.
   If Gorbachev's new electoral system is a school, Zolotkov is a
budding star pupil.
   The lanky Murmansk native with gray-streaked black hair wears a
burgandy tie and light blue shirt, because allies advised him to.
   However, the engineer drew the line at loosening his collar and
tie while campaigning, as his advisers suggested.
   ``Somebody told me that's what American senators do, but it
wouldn't look proper here,'' Zolotkov said in an interview, between
puffs on an imported Pall Mall cigarette.
   Before the Kirov Palace meeting, Zolotkov bought time on an
electric sign that shines down on Murmansk's main square.
   ``VOTE FOR ANDREI ALEKSEYEICH ZOLOTKOV,'' it said.
   He wanted to rent a sound truck but relented when told that the
move might offend other candidates.
   His character became a campaign issue when one participant in the
Kirov Palace meeting asked him if he would have the courage to
publicly oppose a decision by Gorbachev.
   ``Yes,'' he responded.
   ``I already have disagreements with the election law,'' Zolotkov
said. ``Why should a member of the (party) Central Committee have
more votes than I do?''
   The Gorbachev-backed law gives the Communist Party the right to
directly fill 100 of the assembly's 2,250 seats.
   Whether a candidate like Zolotkov can win March 26 is a subject
of keen debate in Murmansk.
   ``Perestroika so far here is more slogans that deeds,'' said Yura
Verbitsk, 24, who works at a plant that burns garbage to generate
electricity. ``There are a lot of people still around from the era
of (Leonid I.) Brezhnev,'' the late Soviet president.
   But the fact Zolotkov even made it to the ballot is a sign of
changing times. To become the candidate proposed by the Murmansk
Shipping Co., he beat out a man who would have been an easy winner
in past elections, an icebreaker captain awarded the coveted title
of Hero of Socialist Labor.
   Zolotkov, a candidate for membership in the Communist Party, says
he is no expert on economics or legal matters but wants to go to
Moscow to make Gorbachev's vision of Soviet democracy work.
   ``If one party is directing things, that's exactly why we need a
stronger legislature,'' he said. ``By my activities, I want to
demonstrate that there can be controls on power.''

<HEAD>Easier Credit, Longer Loans Lead to More Auto Defaults</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wire</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Repo man Kevin McGivern says business is brisker than usual at
his Chicago auto repossession company _ one of the nation's largest
_ with about twice as many people surrendering their cars because
they can't make payments.
   The repossession rate is even more frenetic at Bruce Schneider's
Allied Recovery Inc. in Portland, Ore., where nearly five times as
many car owners are voluntarily handing over their keys compared
with last year.
   ``What's going on right now is no different than at any time when
money has tightened up a little,'' said McGivern. ``It's all
cyclical.''
   Easy credit, including longer loan terms, dating from a time when
interest rates were lower, has spawned an increase in defaulted auto
loans, say automakers, repo agents and some banks.
   It's been somewhat of a boon to the repo business, which thrives
by working for creditors to seize goods bought on borrowed money
when loans aren't repaid on time.
   ``People were attracted to the lower (interest) rates and ran out
and bought on impulse,'' said Huey Mayronne, executive director of
American Recovery Association, trade group for the nation's auto
repossessors.
   ``At the same time they were buying TVs and other things on
credit,'' Mayronne said. ``They didn't realize what their budgets
could handle. It's catching up with them now.''
   Domestic automakers, which offered low-rate loans in 1986 and
1987 to help regain marketshare from foreign competitors, have
especially noticed this trend.
   No. 1 General Motors Corp., for instance, reports that 2 percent
of the vehicles financed through its lending arm, or about 143,000
cars and trucks, were repossessed last year, up from 1.6 percent in
1987 and the highest level in eight years. The rate peaked at 2.9
percent in 1970 but had remained below the 2 percent level until
1988.
   Ford Motor Co.'s repossessions and loan defaults also climbed in
1988 from the previous year, according to its financing unit, Ford
Motor Credit Co. Although the company doesn't provide figures, it
noted that 1988 profits fell 17 percent over the previous year
partly because of credit losses.
   Banks also have been involved in the auto financing frenzy,
introducing 60-month loans about four years ago in reaction to
rapidly rising auto prices. But even though they've seen a slight
rise in credit losses it hasn't been nearly as much as experienced
by the automakers themselves.
   The overall repossession rate of banks that lend directly to
buyers averaged 0.12 percent of outstanding loans in 1988, up
slightly from 0.10 percent the previous year, according to the
American Bankers Association.
   Delinquency rates on direct bank loans averaged 1.83 percent in
1988, up from 1.71 percent the previous year, the bank trade group
said.
   ``The competition is so great among the loan instititions that
they're taking fringe buyers where they wouldn't take them,'' said
repo man Myles Weiss, owner of Able Auto Adjusters in Los Angeles.
``The bottom line is someone will take a chance on you.''
   Ford Motor Credit Chairman William Odom conceded that credit
standards had been lowered, particularly among first-time buyers,
but he said the company has been tightening procedures. He said the
unexpectedly high credit loss of 1988 ``is changing things ... in
the way we evaluate and investigate loan applications at the lower
end of the credit-worthiness scale.''
   With the steady increase in interest rates lately, some industry
experts are predicting that financial institutions will be more
selective in who they lend money to and that many more would-be car
owners will remain on the sidelines.
   But for now lenders must deal with the problems of the recent
past.
   ``Generally speaking the adjusters have been busier than they
have been before,'' said Weiss.
   He declined to provide any figures at his repossession firm, but
some others who did noted an increase, particularly among owners who
voluntarily relinquish their cars.
   Schneider's Oregon repo company used to have one or two people
surrender their cars every week but now he's seeing that same amount
each day. ``You're finding more '86 and '87s being surrendered,'' he
said.
   Chicago repo man McGivern has 10 to 16 voluntary giveups a week,
twice as many as usual.
   ``They (lenders) put out a hellacious amount of paper on car
loans in the last year and a half,'' McGivern said. ``(But) they
would not finance these cars if they did not know they had the
alternative to repossess the car.''
   In many cases, defaults occur in the later stages of long-term
loans, when debt-burdened owners realize their vehicles are worth
less than the amount outstanding on the loan, a condition known in
the industry as being ``upside down.''
   ``Not realizing what could happen to his credit rating ... the
car owner thinks, `maybe I would be better off defaulting,''' said
Donald W. Grigley, senior vice president at Connecticut National
Bank in Hartford, Conn.
   Over a two-year period the value of a new car may depreciate
anywhere from 35 percent to 60 percent, a rate which experts say has
been creeping up in the last three to five years. The longer the
loan the more time it takes to build up equity.
   Grigley gives the following example: a new subcompact costing
$10,000 in 1987 would have a book value of $4,100 today. If the
owner took out a $9,000 bank loan over 48 months at 9 percent
interest, he would still owe $4,902.18, or around $800 more than the
car's value.
   The owner wouldn't gain equity until the 30th month, when the car
would be worth $3,800, vs. $3,750 left on the loan. Full equity is
achieved after four years, when the car is worth $2,800 and the loan
is retired.
   ``The longer you go (in loan period) the more problems you can
have,'' said Weiss. ``A 36-month loan should really be the maximum.''
   After a car is repossessed, voluntarily or not, it usually is
sold at auction, often ``as is.''
   But repossession won't put an end to previous owners' credit
problems. They still remain liable for the difference between the
amount of the loan and what the car sells for.

   For Jim Hooley, the moment of truth came as he
stood on the tarmac in a remote industrial area of the Los Angeles
International Airport, watching Ronald Reagan's eight-car caravan
drive off.
   ``I just suddenly realized, `It's over.' I'm standing there
waving at a car,'' he recalls.
   For eight years, Hooley had been a White House advance man and
then head of the Advance Office, arranging for Reagan's presidential
trips and accompanying him in airplanes and motorcades at home and
abroad.
   Now he was left at the airport.
   He had known he would not travel in this final motorcade to the
former president's new home, but it still came as a shock.
   ``I don't know what you expect, but it sort of ends abruptly,''
he says.
   Hooley's experience is typical of that of many, but not all,
former White House aides as they move from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
to more mundane addresses.
   Some say they experience no pangs.
   ``I had been wanting to get out of government for about five
years so this is a fun thing,'' says Rebecca Range, who directed the
White House Office of Public Liaison before Jan. 20 and is now a
vice president of Texas Air.
   ``After a while I think everyone gets to the point where they
want to live a more normal life,'' says Elizabeth Board, looking for
work after her years as director of the White House Television
Office.
   But for many, like Hooley, it is ``kind of traumatic.''
   ``People handle it differently,'' he says. ``You went from people
who literally cried as they packed their cardboard boxes to others
who went through a state of numbness.
   ``I think when we began to feel it was when the time came to
start clearing out of your offices and new people who were going to
be moving into your offices were beginning to stick their heads in.''
   But even after they were on the airplane headed West, Hooley
says, the impact did not quite sink in for the staff, perhaps not
for Reagan either, since the routine was one they had followed
before.
   Then came the moment at the airport.
   After Hooley arrived back at his suburban Virginia home, workmen
came to remove the White House telephones on every floor _ part of
the elaborate communications setup he enjoyed as head of advance.
   ``All of a sudden you realize that you are like everybody else
now,'' he says.

   Eastern Airlines filed for protection from
creditors in bankruptcy court, the sixth day of a Machinists strike,
blaming pilots for a ``cash crisis'' that paralyzed the nation's
seventh-largest airline.
   The move Thursday came a day after Eastern insisted such a step
remained a last resort in the airline's effort to endure the strike,
which had strong support from pilots and flight attendants.
   The filing under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York
is designed to give Eastern a reprieve from debts while it tries to
restructure and extricate itself from the worst crisis in its
60-year history.

<HEAD>US Sprint Buys U.S. End Of Trans-Atlantic Cable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   US Sprint Communications Co. says it has bought
the U.S. end of a fiber-optic phone cable beneath the Atlantic Ocean
that is scheduled to begin operating in August.
   The cable will be the second to go into operation across the
Atlantic Ocean, following one inaugurated in December by American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., British Telecom Inc. and France Telecom.
   US Sprint's partner in the new cable, called PTAT, is Britain's
Cable and Wireless PLC. Both companies are likely to defray the cost
of the cable by bringing in other partners.
   The two companies said that as part of a new alliance announced
Thursday, to be named Global Fon, they will offer telephone credit
card billing to the United States or United Kingdom in the currency
of the user's choice and a service that will allow seven-digit
calling between specified locations in the two countries.
   Sprint purchased its stake in the cable from the Washington-based
Private Transatlantic Telecommunications System. The acquisition,
which is subject to approval by the Federal Communications
Commission, gives Sprint a 50 percent interest in PTAT along with
Cable and Wireless.
   Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.
   At a New York City news conference carried by closed-circuit
television to Washington and three other U.S. cities, US Sprint
President William T. Esrey said the cable is expected to cost
between $450 million and $475 million when it is completed.
   It will have 17,000 circuits capable of carrying 80,000 digital
voice communications and will have more capacity than all the
existing trans-Atlantic cables combined, the companies said.
   It will compete directly with the TAT-8 trans-Atlantic fiber
cable, built by AT&amp;T and its European partners.
   Esrey said the PTAT cable can operate at half the cost of TAT-8,
but he said that did not necessarily mean Global Fon rates would be
half those of its competitors.
   Esrey said the deal would cause ``very little'' impact on
Sprint's balance sheet. Sprint, the third-largest U.S. long-distance
company after AT&amp;T and MCI Communications Corp, had an operating
loss of $409 million in 1988.
   Esrey said the cable would have a ``substantial amount of
business'' right from the start as Sprint and Cable and Wireless
shift their existing customers to the new cable, which will carry
both business and residential traffic.
   Esrey would not comment on the possible effect the new cable
would have on its competition other than to say, ``We are offering a
quality of service and ... products that are not now available.''
   Esrey said it was ``distinctly possible'' that Sprint would allow
others to buy into its half of the cable.
   ``We have been eagerly approached by a number of people who want
significant capacity'' on PTAT, he said.
   Gordon Owen, deputy chief executive of Cable and Wireless, said
his company's Mercury Communications subsidiary will handle the
British end of the PTAT traffic. Mercury currently carries 11
percent of the U.S.-British phone traffic by satellite, and Cable
and Wireless North America already operates in the United States.
PTAT will have spurs to Ireland and Bermuda.
   Owen said Global Fon also would be carried on a new trans-Pacific
cable expected to be ready in 1990 that is partly owned by Cable and
Wireless and which will link the United States with Japan, Hong Kong
and Singapore.
   Sprint, a subsidiary of United Telecommunications Inc. of
Westwood, Kan., and GTE Corp., now provides voice service to 150
countries and video to 24 countries, Esrey said, along with data
transmission to 90 countries.

<HEAD>Judge Fines Ashland A Record $2.25 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A precedent-setting $2.25 million fine against
Ashland Oil Inc. for negligence in one of the nation's largest
inland fuel spills should be a warning to future violators, federal
officials say.
   ``We want to try and send a message to these people. This is
something we're going to take a hard line on,'' said Charles Sheehy,
U.S. attorney for western Pennsylvania.
   Ashland's penalty, the largest ever imposed against a company for
a fuel spill, ``shows the concern for these types of offenses,''
agreed Charles DeMonaco, assistant chief of the Justice Department's
environmental crime section.
   U.S. District Judge Gustave Diamond on Thursday imposed what he
called a ``gentle sentence'' against the Kentucky company for last
year's fuel spill that fouled two rivers in three states and
threatened to disrupt drinking water supplies for more than a
million people.
   ``Were it not for the defendant's responsible action'' following
the fuel spill and during this week's court proceedings, the penalty
would have been much harsher, he said.
   Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum, however, described the fine as
``excessive.'' It was not immediately decided whether an appeal
would be filed, he said.
   The judge said the company was guilty of more than simple
negligence when the tank at its Floreffe Terminal ruptured on Jan.
2, 1988, unleashing 3.8 million gallons of diesel fuel. More than
700,000 gallons escaped a dike and entered the Monongahela River 25
miles south of Pittsburgh.
   The fuel moved down the Monongahela, a source of drinking water
for suburban Pittsburgh, then entered the Ohio River, also a source
of drinking water.
   Authorities blamed the accident on a dime-sized flaw in the
tank's World War II-era steel.
   ``The company did indeed have a responsibility to exercise more
than minimal care,'' Diamond said.
   Diamond presided in a criminal case in which Ashland pleaded no
contest to two misdemeanor counts under the Clean Water and Refuse
acts. Each count normally would carry a maximum fine of $200,000 per
count.
   But Diamond invoked a special fines provision, marking the first
time the federal provision had ever been applied in an environmental
criminal case since it was instituted five years ago. He therefore
was not limited in setting a fine as long as half of it represented
actual damages.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Ashland
more than $50,000 for safety violations, and the Environmental
Protection Agency fined the company $145,000 for alleged
deficiencies in its spill prevention plan.
   Ashland is negotiating with state governments to settle civil
penalties and damage claims totaling more than $10 million. In
addition, 20 class action suits are pending against the company,
Schrum said.
   About 23,000 suburban Pittsburgh residents endured a week without
tap water because their system lacked sufficient reserves to last
until the river current carried the pollution downstream past their
water intakes.
   Mandatory conservation was ordered for businesses and homes
elsewhere in parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.
   So far, Ashland said it has paid about $18 million in clean-up
costs and civil claims from affected residents and businesses.
   ``The best deterrence against a recurrence of this kind of
accident is the expense and humiliation my client has already been
subjected to,'' Ashland attorney Thomas Donovan said.
   ``This is an incident that involves no willful misconduct,'' he
said. ``No one got sick. No one was physically injured. There was
inconvenience ... but it's purely a matter of economics.''
   Donovan cited the company's quick move to resolve such problems
in asking Diamond to merge the two counts and impose the usual limit
of $200,000.
   DeMonaco, however, argued for a multimillion-dollar fine.
``Ashland without question was negligent,'' he said.
   Diamond agreed a low fine would not deter future violators,
sufficiently punish Ashland or protect the public.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``A deterrent effect of all of this will
come not so much from the fine ... but the object lesson.''

<HEAD>Dollar Drops, Stocks Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo today, while share prices gained on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   After opening lower at 128.85 yen, the dollar finished the day
almost unchanged at 128.88 yen, down 0.35 yen from Thursday's
129.23-yen closing. It ranged during the day between 128.82 and
129.08 yen.
   Dealers said the U.S. currency's decline was prompted by a
Federal Reserve Board official's comment early today that the dollar
needs to fall further in order for the United States to reduce its
trade deficit.
   Anxiety over February U.S. unemployment figures, due to be
released later today in Washington, also sidelined many players,
said a dealer at a major commercial bank who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Because of the upcoming release of employment numbers, there
was no major movement today in Tokyo,'' said an exchange dealer at a
major U.S. commercial bank in Tokyo. ``There was some active selling
by insurance companies in the early morning when the dollar got up
above 129 yen, but that was about it all day.''
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 181.21 points on Thursday, rose 45.33
points, or 0.14 percent, to close the week at 31,701.78.
   Share prices droped sharply during the morning session, with the
Nikkei index falling 116.33 points before noon. However, strong
buying by private investors pushed the index up in the afternoon
session.
   ``Some shares, which once were considered overpriced, have come
down to a level which appears reasonable to investors,'' said
Ichitaro Watanabe, a dealer at Nikko Securities Co.
   Dealers said the market had been bearish since the end of
February because of fund managers' unwillingness to risk their
portfolios near the end of the accounting period for mutual and
trust funds. Japan's fiscal year ends on March 31.
   ``Most fund managers appear to have won reasonable profits thanks
to the bullish market throughout the year,'' said Keiichi Nishida, a
dealer at Kidder Peabody Securities in Tokyo. ``Most have already
cashed in and there doesn't seem to be much incentive in the market
for buying at this point.''
   But he said investors might turn to buying again if share prices
go down further.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Lower In Thin Trading, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar lost ground in thin European trading
this morning as the market waited for the release of the latest U.S.
unemployment figures. Gold prices rose about $5 an ounce.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the market had come to a virtual
standstill in anticipation of the U.S. unemployment statistics for
February, which were to be released later today.
   Economists were predicting a decline in the unemployment rate to
5.3 percent from 5.4 percent.
   Some traders said the U.S. unemployment report could shake the
market out of its current lethargy if the figures come in
significantly above or below expectations.
   But others doubted that the report would be capable of lifting
the market out of its current doldrums.
   One trader said he thought it was ``rather ridiculous how the
market can be paralyzed'' because of what likely would be just a
minor change in a monthly statistic.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.35 yen to a closing 128.88 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 129.00 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8585 West German marks, down from 1.8600; 1.5863
Swiss francs, down from 1.5895; 6.3025 French francs, down from
6.3125; 2.0974 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1000; 1,364.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,366.00; 1.1970 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2000.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7235, compared with
$1.7183 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $395 a troy ounce and at
midmorning the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended
price of $397, both up from $391.55 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $396.70, up from $391.75 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.58 to close at a bid $396.08.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.03 a troy
ounce, up from Thursday's $5.88.

<NOTE>TICKET SCRAMBLE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of would-be travelers, suddenly transformed into
unsecured creditors, tried to get refunds or fly on other carriers.
   The bankruptcy court must approve refunds for those holding some
$200 million worth of tickets. But if a passenger's destination were
a popular one, another carrier might honor the ticket, although
possibly at a higher price. And passengers who bought tickets with a
major credit card likely would benefit from a federal law that
protects consumers who make credit card purchases but fail to
receive goods or services.

   Some highlights of the Machinists union strike against Eastern
Airlines:
   _Feb. 1 _ Eastern rejects binding arbitration offer by National
Mediation Board, which declares a 30-day cooling-off period.
   _Feb. 9 _ Eastern suspends about 100 Machinists union members
without pay after sporadic walkouts and slowdowns.
   _Feb. 15 _ More than 97 percent of the 8,500 Machinists authorize
a strike. Eastern seeks $150 million in wage concessions; Machinists
want $50 million in raises.
   _Feb. 22 _ Federal mediator begins meeting again with Eastern and
union officials. No progress reported.
   _March 1 _ Eastern makes sweetened contract offer to pilots to
try to keep them flying if Machinists strike.
   _March 2 _ Pilots reject offer. Eastern offers Machinists new
contract that would reduce pay but keep it 13 percent higher than
employees who took 1986 cut.
   _March 3 _ President Bush refuses mediation board request to use
authority to delay strike 60 days. Machinists sent home for the day
after Eastern alleges planned sabotage. Machinists reject latest
contract offer. Eastern cancels up to 75 percent of weekend flights
but pledges to hire substitute workers. Talks collapse at midnight.
   _March 4 _ Strike begins, canceling almost 90 percent of Eastern
flights, stranding passengers across nation, in Caribbean and Latin
America.
   _March 5 _ Few Eastern flights take off as pilots honor the
strike. Machinists threaten to create nationwide commuter snarls by
picketing 12 commuter railroads and Amtrak, but cancel plans after
federal judge in New York bars employees on three of the rail lines
from honoring picket lines.
   _March 6 _ Eastern idles 7,000 non-union workers and cancels all
flights except those on its Northeast shuttle and three round-trips
weekly between Miami and South America. Airline asks federal judge
to order pilots back to work.
   _March 7 _ Federal judge refuses to order pilots to work. Eastern
warns it cannot operate for more than 48-72 hours without pilots and
could file for bankruptcy protection. Pilots union reports overture
by management seeking new talks. Eastern furloughs 2,500 more
employees. Threatened national safety slowdown by pilots' union has
only sporadic effect. House subcommittee approves bill that would
require Bush to intervene in strike. Bush reiterates opposition to
intervention but says he will ask Congress to ban secondary boycotts
if the Machinists try to shut down rail service.
   _March 8 _ TWA Chairman Carl Icahn says he is willing to talk
with Machinists asking him to seek control of Eastern. Continuing
pilot safety action has little effect. Machinists fail to win court
permission to shut down commuter railroads in the New York City and
Philadelphia areas. Eastern announces reduced shuttle rates _
weekend one-way fares to $12 and weekdays fares to $49. USAir
announces deal to acquire Eastern's two Philadelphia-Canada routes
and eight gates at Philadelphia airport.
   _March 9 _ Eastern files for protection from creditors in
bankruptcy court. Machinists call for boycotts of all Texas
Air-owned enterprises, particularly Continental Airlines. Thousands
of would-be travelers, suddenly transformed into unsecured
creditors, tried to get refunds or fly on other carriers.

<TEXT>
   Here is a look at Eastern Airlines, which has filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection from creditors due to the strike by its
Machinists which was honored by its pilots and flight attendants.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Owner: The 60-year-old airline has been owned by Texas Air Corp.,
headed by Chairman Frank Lorenzo, since 1986.
   Headquarters: Miami.
   Employees: 31,200, including 8,500 members of the Machinists
union, which includes mechanics, bag handlers and other ground
workers; 3,500 pilots and 5,900 flight attendants.
   Size of fleet: 250 jets.
   Cities served: 118, with major markets in South Florida, the
Caribbean, East Coast and Latin America.
   Number of pre-strike scheduled flights: 1,040 daily.
   Passengers: 100,000 average daily.
   Assets: $4.5 billion.
   Liabilities: $3.4 billion.
   Main issues: Eastern, which claims it lost $1 billion in the past
decade and is losing more than $1 million a day, is seeking between
$125 million and $150 million in wage concessions. The Machinists
are seeking $50 million in raises.
   Where negotiations stand: President Bush ignored the
recommendation of the National Mediation Board to appoint an
emergency panel that would have delayed delay the strike 60 days.
The strike began at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday.
   After the strike: Eastern vowed to continue flying, but was
forced to slash operations to 4 percent of scheduled flights with a
skeleton crew of 1,500 workers after pilots joined the striking
Machinists. Federal court orders have prevented the Machinists from
proposed secondary picketing of railroads, which had threatened to
disrupt commuter lines in major metropolitan areas.
   The airline sought but failed to get the courts to order pilots
back to work.

<HEAD>New Energy Secretary Gets Fast Start on Nuclear Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is moving
quickly to tackle the problems of modernizing the nation's
problem-plagued nuclear weapons plants and cleaning up their
hazardous wastes.
   Even before his formal swearing-in Thursday, a team of nuclear
experts assembled by Watkins had begun assessing conditions and
prospects at key weapons plants to give him an independent view of
the problems, department officials said.
   Members of the Watkins team visited the Savannah River Plant,
near Aiken, S.C., last week and were at the Hanford Reservation in
Washington state earlier this week, the officials said.
   The creation of the team and the start of their work were not
announced by the department.
   Watkins informed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee late last month that he wanted a special review of efforts
at Savannah River to prepare the restart of three reactors there
that produce tritium, a perishable and scarce gas needed to make
nuclear warheads. The reactors have been shut down since last spring
because of safety, technical and management problems.
   ``This review will provide me with an integrated overview of
progress and planned activities'' at Savannah River and other key
parts of the weapons complex, Watkins said in a written response to
questions from members of the Senate panel. A text of Watkins'
comments was made available by the panel this week.
   The department has said that unless it gets at least one of the
Savannah River reactors back in operation by the end of the year,
supplies of tritium would be dangerously low.
   Will Callicott, a department spokesman, said he could confirm
that members of the new review team had visited Savannah River, but
he declined to provide more details.
   Tom Bauman, a spokesman at the department's Hanford office in
Richland, Wash., said two members of the team, Leo Duffy and Fred
Carlson, had visited the site on Monday. He, too, said he could not
discuss other details of the visit.
   At Watkins' swearing-in ceremony at Energy Department
headquarters, President Bush pledged to ``waste no time'' starting
to correct the weapons plants problems, including extensive soil and
groundwater contamination at some sites.
   ``This task is critical,'' Bush told an audience of several
hundred Energy Department employees.
   ``These problems developed over time and they'll be fully solved
only over time, but we'll waste no time getting started on fixing
these problems,'' Bush said.
   The department in the waning days of the Reagan administration
issued a preliminary plan for spending $81 billion over the next 21
years to modernize and begin cleaning up the weapons complex. Bush
has not explicitly endorsed the plan.
   At his swearing-in, Watkins said his main goal was to instill a
more responsible attitude in Energy Department workers that would
lead to sounder practices in the nuclear field.
   ``Nuclear power demands no less than the best from all who
control it,'' he said. ``This, then, is exactly what I ask of my
department: a commitment to excellence.
   ``So I ask you to help me forge in the workplace a culture that
rejects the mediocre and substandard.''
   Watkins last week circulated a memo to department employees
around the country spelling out some of his top priorities,
including restarting the Savannah River reactors and developing
five-year objectives for waste cleanup at each of the nuclear
weapons sites, department spokeswoman Christina Sankey said.
   Other priorities mentioned in the memo include legislation to
remove the remaining price controls on natural gas; moving ahead
with the $5.9 billion superconducting super collider project to
study the nature of matter and energy; pushing legislation to allow
oil exploration on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge in Alaska; and developing an integrated national energy
policy.

   Sen. Patrick Leahy says he needs to know what
role the Commodity Futures Trading Commission played in an
investigation of the Chicago exchanges before his committee decides
whether to reauthorize the agency.
   Leahy, D-Vt., made the comment Thursday during an appearance
before the Agriculture Committee by CFTC chairman Wendy Lee Gramm.
   The committee chairman said he and fellow senators would have to
know what the commission did during the two-year undercover FBI
investigation of alleged abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Mrs. Gramm said her agency was cooperating with the FBI. But she
would not elaborate, saying the Justice Department told her to
refrain from further comment.
   But Leahy said, ``Without knowing, it's very difficult for us to
pursue oversight responsibilities.'' Leahy said he has asked
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh for a senators-only briefing.
   Both the Senate and House have been conducting hearings to
determine if the commission should be restructured to better police
the exchanges.
   The CFTC is the federal agency charged with overseeing the
exchanges involved with commodities trading, but its authority to do
so is granted by Congress. Its authorization expires in September.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., asked Mrs. Gramm if the commission
asked the FBI to investigate.
   ``How the investigation got started is something I cannot comment
on,'' she replied. ``I can't say the nature of the cooperation of
the CFTC.''
   When asked by Sen. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., whether the CFTC could
have done its own undercover investigation, Mrs. Gramm said she did
not think her agency had the authority to do the kind of criminal
work such a probe entails.
   ``It is my view that we have a good cooperative effort (with the
FBI),'' she said.
   ``We are concerned about whether you do the best job you can,''
said Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D. He said he wondered why the
commission had never asked if it had the authority for undercover
work.
   Mrs. Gramm said the commission uses aggressive techniques for
uncovering fraud and abuse, and the exchanges have been responsive
to enforcement action by the commission.
   Daschle said he could not see any objective measure of the CFTC's
success and asked Mrs. Gramm to supply him with such evidence later.
   Leahy asked Mrs. Gramm to provide within 30 days an analysis of
the pros and cons of 11 proposals for tightening oversight of the
exchange floors.
   They are:
   _requiring the exchanges to devote more resources to floor
surveillance and compliance;
   _requiring greater representation on exchange governing boards of
non-floor membership interests like wire house and trade firms, and
public members;
   _barring exchange members who have been repeatedly disciplined
from serving on exchange disciplinary or oversight panels;
   _increasing penalties for trading abuses;
   _requiring broker associations to register and limit trading
among association members;
   _curbing dual trading in pits where the exchange audit trail
cannot demonstrate a one-minute accuracy rate of 90 percent or
better;
   _mandating improvements in exchange audit trails;
   _increasing physical presence of CFTC staff on exchange floors;
   _barring oral orders on the floor;
   _adjusting CFTC rules to attract and keep the best professional
staff possible; and
   _increasing CFTC powers.
   He also asked her to provide any other proposals that the
committee could consider.

   State legislative leaders say they oppose
raising federal excise taxes because past increases in those taxes
on gas, alcohol and cigarettes have cost the states billions of
dollars in lost revenue.
   To prove that point, the National Conference of State
Legislatures, released a study Thursday estimating the cost to
states of federal excise tax increases. Conference leaders were
meeting today with President Bush and administration officials.
   ``Whenever the federal government has raised those excise taxes,
the states have lost money,'' said Samuel B. Nunez Jr., president
pro tem of the Louisiana Senate and president of the conference.
   The study estimated that the states have lost revenue amounting
to $3.7 billion as a result of increases in those federal taxes in
1983 and 1985, and projected the figure would grow to $7.2 billion
by 1992.
   The study said that higher federal excise taxes increase the
final cost of the taxed goods and that higher prices in turn reduce
the quantities purchased. Because states also tax those goods, based
on quantity rather than price, the amount of state excise tax
revenue is reduced, the study said.
   The conference is lobbying against an increase in federal excise
taxes as part of any deficit-reduction package this year. Maine
House Speaker John Martin, vice president of the conference, said it
would not oppose a federal income tax increase as part of a deficit
solution.
   The study was underwritten by a major cigarette company, but
Martin said the company, Philip Morris USA, had nothing to do with
its contents.
   States traditionally rely on excise taxes on cigarettes, alcohol
and motor fuels for large portions of their revenues. Most states
earmark those revenues for specific purposes, with most fuel taxes
going for transportation needs.
   Martin said further increases in the federal excise taxes would
inhibit states and local governments from further increases in their
own excise taxes _ thus limiting an important revenue source.
   The study estimated that a 1 percent increase in the price of
gasoline reduces sales 0.6 percent, and that comparable increases in
the price of cigarettes reduce sales 0.4 percent, and in distilled
spirits, 1 percent.
   In 1983, the federal tax on cigarettes rose from 8 cents to 16
cents per pack, and the tax on gasoline rose from 4 cents to 9 cents
per gallon. The tax on distilled spirits rose from $10.50 to $12.50
per gallon in 1985, the study said.
   The study was conducted for the conference by the Policy
Economics Group of Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co., a national certified
public accounting firm.

   A Democratic measure to increase the minimum
wage by $1.30 an hour to $4.65 over three years is gaining ground in
Congress even as President Bush insists he will veto any raise
higher than his own proposal.
   The plan to raise the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage for the first
time since 1981 won approval from the House labor standards
subcommittee on Thursday. Democratic leaders, at the same time,
called for a compromise on a sub-minimum ``training wage'' for new
hires in hopes of passing the increase this month.
   Rep. Austin Murphy, chairman of the subcommittee, said he plans
to propose a reduced minimum when the bill reaches the House floor,
although requirements will be far stricter than what the
administration wants.
   The House bill drawn up Thursday is virtually identical to the
one passed Wednesday by the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, where Chairman Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., says he hopes
the legislation is on a ``fast track'' for approval.
   But the Bush administration repeated warnings Thursday that an
increase beyond 90 cents an hour over three years and without its
own reduced minimum for all newly hired workers would be vetoed.
   ``The entire package is the bottom line, both the $4.25 figure
and the six-month training wage at $3.35,'' said Dale Tate, a
spokeswoman for Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole. ``We've come more
than halfway towards meeting the goal'' of proponents of a minimum
wage increase.
   Despite the differences, Democrats were encouraged that the White
House favors an increase at all.
   ``Recent White House proposals ... are both constructive and
encouraging,'' said Murphy, D-Pa.
   The Bush package would keep the hourly floor at $3.35 for all
newly hired workers for their first six months employment on any
job. Otherwise, 30 cents an hour would be added to the minimum
annually for three years.
   The Democratic plan would raise the minimum to $3.85 on enactment
and add 40 cents an hour in the next two years, to reach $4.65 in
1991.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., has scheduled action on the
measure by his House Education and Labor Committee next Tuesday. He
said he hopes for a full House vote the following day, although a
spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said no vote
is expected there until members return from the Easter recess in
April.
   Hawkins became the latest Democratic leader to reverse field on
the training wage issue, saying Thursday he's willing to accept a
sub-minimum if it is limited and includes education and ``real
training'' requirements.
   Democratic committee aides said the Murphy plan being drawn up
would limit a sub-minimum to first-time workers and likely have
specific requirements for training on different occupations. The
aides said duration of the sub-minimum would be for between 30 and
90 days and that the lower wage would be pegged to a percentage of
the standard minimum wage.
   ``Our amendment will be more restrictive than the proposals we
have heard from the president,'' said Murphy. ``However, our effort
will show we are sincere and prepared to address all the components
of this issue.''
   Democrats and organized labor have long opposed a second tier for
new employees because of fears that workers would be laid off in
favor of those covered by the lower scale.
   But Hawkins said Thursday: ``If they want to have a training
wage, we will discuss it with them ... It would have to be a
meaningful training wage. It could not be one in name that allows
only a sub-minimum.''

<HEAD>Three Plead Guilty in Pentagon Purchasing Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief prosecutor in the Pentagon
purchasing scandal says cooperation from three businessmen who have
pleaded guilty will help him move ahead on the case at a
``tremendous pace.''
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson commented Thursday after the three
pleaded guilty to a variety of charges stemming from the 2{-year-old
investigation _ code-named ``Operation Ill Wind'' _ of the
Pentagon's $150-billion-a-year purchasing practices.
   One of the men who pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court was
Charles F. Gardner, 58, former general manager of Unisys Corp.'s
surveillance and fire control systems division in Great Neck, N.Y.
   Gardner admitted bribing Melvyn Paisley, the former assistant
secretary of the Navy for research, engineering and systems, by
buying Paisley's condominium in Sun Valley, Idaho, for an inflated
price in 1986, and to funnelling illegal corporate contributions to
congressional campaigns.
   ``These pleas of guilty ... are significant developments not only
because of what they demonstrate in themselves, but also because the
cooperation we will receive from these three individuals will move
this investigation forward at ... a tremendous pace,'' Hudson said.
   James G. Neal and Kenneth F. Brooke, both private consultants,
pleaded guilty to other charges before U.S. District Court Judge
Claude Hylton. Neal, a consultant to Unisys, worked closely with
Gardner, prosecutors said in court documents. Gardner also worked
with William Galvin, a private consultant who is Brooke's stepfather.
   Neal admitted conspiring to bribe Garland Tomlin Jr., who was a
Navy engineer with the Naval Electronics systems Command until his
retirement in October 1985.
   On instructions from Gardner, Neal transferred in 1983 and 1984 a
total of $400,000 to a Longwood International, a company in Nassau,
Bahamas owned by Tomlin in order to influence Tomlin's decisions,
the government said. Tomlin has not been charged with any crime.
   Gardner was charged in a criminal information with three counts,
including bribery, conspiracy to commit bribery and file false
statements and aiding and assisting in the filing of a false tax
return. He faces a maximum sentence of 23 years in prison and fines
of up to $750,000.
   Prosecutors said Gardner amassed a slush fund by hiring
``consultants'' to Unisys with the understanding that some money
would be placed ``in bank accounts, both domestic and foreign, for
purposes of bribery, illegal campaign contributions, and in part for
... Gardner's personal use.''
   The government also said Gardner caused Unisys to ``make and
present to the departments of the Navy and Air Force false,
fictitious and fraudulent claims upon and against the United
States.''
   Unisys, a giant computer company with headquarters in Blue Bell,
Pa., said in a statement that it had cooperated with the government
and welcomed Gardner's guilty pleas.
   ``What has been uncovered is a deliberate fraud and other
criminal activities, carefully disguised by a small group of former
Sperry employees and consultants,'' the company said. Unisys is a
successor to Sperry Corp.
   The government said Gardner, at Galvin's suggestion, arranged to
have Neal buy Paisley's resort condominium in August 1986 for
$149,000, a price above fair market value. A year later the property
sold for $100,000.
   Hudson said the condominium purchase was designed to influence
Paisley's actions on two Pentagon contracts sought by Unisys, one on
the Aegis automated radar firing system and the other on the Marine
air traffic and landing system. Unisys eventually received a portion
of the $9 billion Aegis contract.
   Paisley, now a private consultant, has not been charged with any
crime, but prosecutors said he ``performed certain official acts to
benefit'' Unisys with regard to the two contracts.
   Gardner also caused illegal $1,000 corporate contributions to be
made in 1986 and 1987 to the campaigns of Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., and
former Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., both members of a House committee
that handled defense issues. Dyson and Chappell have denied knowing
that illegal contributions were funnelled to their campaigns.
   In January, Robert D. Barrett, a former Unisys executive, pleaded
guilty in January to charges stemming from the complicated scheme to
make illegal campaign contributions.
   Prosecutors spelled out an elaborate network of companies in
Northern Virginia that Neal set up at Gardner's request to receive
money from Unisys and Sperry.
   Neal also pleaded guilty to making false claims to the government
and conspiring to defraud the government by concealing his true
taxable income. He faces up to 15 years in prison and fines of
$750,000.
   Brooke, 40, pleaded guilty to evading about $66,000 in taxes in
1985, prosecutors said. He faces a sentence of five years in prison
and a fine of up to $250,000.

   The third generation of the family that
founded Ford Motor Co. has stepped down with the next generation
waiting in the wings, soon to get more say-so in the nation's No. 2
automaker's operations.
   William Clay Ford on Thursday announced his retirement from the
company founded by his grandfather, effective at the end of the
month.
   The fourth generation of the automaking family is represented by
Ford's son, William C. Ford Jr., and nephew, Edsel B. Ford II. The
31-year-old William Ford Jr., called Billy, is managing director of
Ford of Switzerland and Edsel Ford is general sales manager for
Ford's Lincoln-Mercury Division.
   Both of the young Fords are members of the company's board of
directors, but neither holds key positions.
   ``I think that will be taken care of in the near future,''
William Ford said at a rare news conference at Ford headquarters
Thursday. He said he expected the cousins to be named to committees
of the company's board in the near future.
   Ford has been a member of the company's board of directors since
1948, the year before he graduated from Yale, and will remain a
member of the board and as chairman of its finance and executive
committees.
   Ford's retirement announcement, five days before his 64th
birthday, was no surprise. For weeks, there has been talk around
auto circles in Detroit about the roles of Billy and Edsel in the
company. A Fortune magazine article hit the newsstands in December,
saying that Ford Chairman Donald Petersen didn't believe the two
were ready for leadership posts.
   During the annual automobile show in Detroit in January, however,
Petersen said the cousins were ``now coming of age.''
   Ford said Thursday that members of the family should be in top
positions of the company. However, no family member should be given
a position simply because of the family name, he said.
   ``Nature has got to take its course,'' Ford said.
   The Ford family, through trusts and individually, exercises 40
percent of voting power of shareholders through a special Class B
stock. The number of votes connected with each share of Class B
stock is adjusted before each annual meeting to give those
shareholders the 40 percent.
   Ford called the Class B stock ``a great anti-takeover measure.''
   Ford, who took part in decisions that lifted the company out of
severe financial troubles in the early 1980s, has been chairman of
the board's design committee since it was created in 1957.
   Two of the main reasons the company was put on the road from
financial problems to the nation's most-profitable automaker were
the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable automobiles, both of which
capitalized on sleek, aerodynamic looks.
   In offering a public farewell to Ford, company Chairman Harold
Poling said Thursday that development of the aerodynamic look
``wasn't exactly a unanimous thing in the company.''
   Later, Ford said, ``I was all for it. I think everybody kind of
resists change. Personally I find it very appealing.''
   He was the youngest of four children of Edsel B. Ford, president
of the automobile company from 1919 until his death in 1943.
   Ford's oldest brother, Henry Ford II, was the company's
president, chairman and chief executive officer before his death in
September 1987. His other brother, Benson Ford, was vice president
and chairman of the dealer policy board when he died in 1978.
   Ford also is the sole owner and president of the Detroit Lions
professional football club.
   Now that he has retired, Ford said he will have more time to
devote to golf and the Lions, one of the worst teams in the NFL last
year with a 4-12 record.

<HEAD>Cadbury Schweppes Moves Beverage Headquarters to Stamford from London</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cadbury Schweppes PLC says moving the
worldwide headquarters for it beverage businesses from London to
Stamford will streamline operations as the British soft drinks and
confectionery group goes after a larger share of the multibillion
dollar soft drink market.
   ``We need to have a clear sense of vision at the center,'' Sir
Adrian Cadbury, chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, said Thursday at
Cadbury Schweppes Beverages offices.
   Cadbury Schweppes Beverages will occupy the same building as its
U.S. division, already based in Stamford.
   ``The United States is clearly the right location for our
international beverages headquarters,'' Cadbury said. ``It's the
largest and most developed soft drink market in the world. ... More
fundamentally, this country is the foundation of new ideas and of
innovation for the beverage industry generally.''
   Cadbury Schweppes Beverages is closing the Atlanta headquarters
of its Canada Dry and Sunkist soda divisions and moving them to
Stamford as part of the consolidation.
   Also affected are Cadbury Beverages' North American, European,
British and International units.
   Cadbury also announced that it will open a new, worldwide
research center in nearby Trumbull in June, consolidating work now
done at laboratories in Williamson, N.Y., and in Dollis Hill near
London, which are being closed. The Trumbull facility will employ
about 100 people, mostly scientists and engineers.
   James P. Schadt, president and chief executive of Cadbury
Schweppes Beverages, estimated that the moves announced Thursday
will create about 200 jobs in Connecticut, including 70 in Stamford,
and pump more than $10 million into the Connecticut economy in 1989
alone.
   The company has eliminated about 500 jobs worldwide during the
last year as part of its consolidation effort, Schadt said.
   Cadbury Schweppes Beverages' other products include Mott's and
Red Cheek apple-based juices and sauces, and Holland House, Rose's
and Mr. and Mrs. ``T'' cocktail mixers.
   The company had about 3 percent of the $26 billion in soft drink
sales in the United States last year, company officials said. It
employs about 6,300 people worldwide, including 350 in Stamford.
   Cadbury began consolidating its soft drink businesses in 1987
when Schadt, a former executive of Pepsico Inc., was named managing
director of the Cadbury Schweppes beverage businesses.
   The parent company announced earlier this month that its 1988
after-tax profit jumped 28.5 percent over a year ago, helped by
strong growth in Britain as well as Australia and neighboring
countries.
   After-tax profit in the 12 months ended Dec. 31 totaled 140.5
million pounds, the equivalent of $242 million, compared with 109.3
million pounds the year before.
   Earnings per share rose to 23.47 pence, or 40 cents, from 19.05
pence, helped by a change in the company's tax accounting.
   Sales rose 17.2 percent to 2.38 billion pounds, or $4.1 billion,
from 2.03 billion pounds.
   Cadbury and Schweppes merged in 1969. The company acquired Canada
Dry in 1986.

<TEXT>
   The State of California has charged
Trans World Airlines with deceptive air travel advertising.
   The complaint filed Thursday alleges that TWA advertised in
newspapers and other media a low one-way fare to London, although in
fact the fare could be obtained only by buying a round-trip ticket.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp issued a statement saying
the suit _ in San Diego County Superior Court _ would bar the
airline from further unfair advertising, and assess civil penalties.
   Van de Kamp said TWA's advertising fails to clearly and
adequately disclose other fees that must be paid to utilize the
advertised one-way fare.
   The complaint also alleges that TWA falsely advertised that
customers who used the low London fare could obtain an Alamo rental
car free. But it says there is a mandatory fuel fee regardless of
how far the car is driven and even when the customers buy their own
fuel.
   The announcement said that in filing the action, the attorney
general's office took notice of a recent decision by the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia that rejected U.S.
Department of Transportation rules permitting airlines to omit
certain taxes and fees from advertised flight costs.

<TEXT>
   Scandal-shaken Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.,
in a gesture of public regret, will cut the salaries of its top
executives next month, news reports said Friday.
   The pay cuts, ranging between 10 and 20 percent, will be in force
for six months and affect 35 top executives, including NTT President
Haruo Yamaguchi and six other directors, Kyodo News Service said.
   Officials at NTT, Japan's largest corporation, were not available
for comment late Friday.
   Three former top NTT officials have been arrested for alleged
bribery in connection with a stock-profiteering scandal involving
unlisted stocks offered at bargain prices by Recruit Co., an
information conglomerate.
   The NTT officials allegedly gave Recruit favorable treatment in
exchange for the large profits they received when the stocks were
publicly traded and skyrocketed in value.
   Kyodo said Yamaguchi personally reported the pay cuts to Posts
and Telecommunications Minister Seiichi Kataoka earlier Friday.
Kataoka expressed support for the action, and urged NTT to do more
to mend its tarnished image, it said.
   Yamaguchi himself will take a pay cut of 20 percent, while the
salaries of directors and auditors will be cut by 10 to 15 percent,
Kyodo said.

   News of continuing strong growth in employment
dealt the stock market a broad setback today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 14.82 points to
2,276.61 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 4 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 215 up, 806 down and
419 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.68 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate
fell to 5.1 percent, a 15-year low, in February from 5.4 percent the
month before.
   The report also showed an increase of 289,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, topping most advance estimates.
   Wall Street had been anxiously awaiting the report all week,
hoping for new evidence that economic growth was slowing, taking
upward pressure off inflation and interest rates.
   So the figures were poorly received in both the bond and stock
markets. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, fell about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down } at 117~; Exxon, down \ at 44}; American Telephone &amp;

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .86 to 164.50. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .93 at 328.43.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 4.11 points

<HEAD>North Dakota Committee Endorses New State Name: Dakota</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A joint committee of the Legislature has
voted 7-3 to rename North Dakota simply ``Dakota,'' ridding the
state of an ``unimaginative, unattractive, ordinary'' word.
   Critics called the much-ballyhooed idea a public relations stunt,
but the Joint Constitutional Revisions Committee on Thursday
endorsed a resolution that would put the name change on the November
1990 ballot as a constitutional amendment.
   Before that referendum is held, though, the resolution will have
to be approved by the state Senate and the state House. If the
voters eventually endorse the idea, the name change would also have
to be approved by Congress.
   Gov. George Sinner does not oppose the name change but has no
plans to lobby for it, press secretary Robert Jansen said.
   State Tourism Director Jim Fuglie, who has plugged the name
change in radio interviews across the country, was ecstatic about
Thursday's vote, vowing to resign his job and work full-time to
campaign for it if lawmakers eventually place the issue before the
voters.
   The word ``North'' is an ``unimaginative, unattractive, ordinary
word tacked onto the spectacular word, Dakota,'' Fuglie said.
   Backers also say the word ``North'' conjures up a cold, harsh
climate and detracts from the word ``Dakota,'' which means
``friend'' and is the name of a group of Indian tribes also known as
the Sioux.
   Dakota is ``such a beautiful word,'' said Rep. Janet Wentz.
``When we were given the name North Dakota, we didn't have anything
to say about it.''
   Sen. Ray Holmberg, one of the three legislators who voted against
the resolution, said the name North Dakota is ``extremely important
to the history and heritage of the state and should not be used as a
public relations experiment.''
   The proposal also has drawn fire in newspaper editorials and
letters to the editor, and became the focus of a tongue-in-cheek
campaign by a Montana paper to find a new name for the state. The
winner of the Billings Gazette contest was ``Manitscolda,'' as in
``Man, it's cold-a.''
   Before voting for the idea, committee members shot down an
amendment that would have changed the state's name to ``Dakotah.''
Sen. Donna Nalewaja, said she thought it might be ``classy'' to add
the ``h,'' but said it would meet resistance from voters.

<HEAD>$38.8 Million Verdict For Workers In Long Casino Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM DAHLBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has awarded 36 fired casino workers $38.8
million in a case that could affect the way Nevada's gaming industry
hires and fires its employees.
   The federal court jury on Thursday found the Las Vegas Hilton
guilty of age and sex discrimination, breach of contract, bad faith
and inflicting severe emotional distress in the firing of the
workers in September 1983.
   Hilton attorneys contended that casinos have the right to hire
and fire at will because of the volatile nature of the business and
the large amount of cash that is handled.
   The resort also claimed the dealers understood they could be
fired at will and accepted it as a tradeoff for large amount of
money they made in wages and tips.
   The dealers, though, claimed they were the victims of age and sex
discrimination when they were replaced by younger female workers,
and contended the hotel gave them an implied contract when hired
that they would not be fired except with justifiable cause.
   ``Casinos have traditionally held themselves to be above the
law,'' said Brian Berman, an attorney for the plaintiffs. ``We think
the jury sent a clear example to the employers in the state of
Nevada that they cannot do this.''
   Hilton executives testified that the workers were fired over the
1983 Labor Day weekend after other, unsuccessful attempts to clear
up an unusually low win percentage in the hotel's blackjack pit.
   The verdict came after four days of deliberation following a
14-week trial.
   The biggest portion of the award was for punitive damages, which
the jury assessed at $30 million.
   Steve Wynn, owner of the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino, attacked
the verdict, saying it was stupid for a jury to award that much in
such a case.
   The affected dealers disagreed.
   ``It's been 5{ years of praying and a little hope,'' said Jack
Bosarge. ``We realized we were up against one of the biggest
corporations in the world, but we all stuck together and came out on
top.''
   Hilton attorneys said they would ask the verdict be set aside,
claiming the jury was misled by sympathy for the workers. If that
fails, resort attorneys said they would appeal.
   ``We're very disappointed,'' said Hilton attorney Raymond Kelly.
``(Casino manager) Robert Kelley and the Hilton did exactly what it
had to do under the circumstances.''
   All but five of the casino workers won claims for age
discrimination and were awarded sums ranging from $7,000 to $107,000
for lost wages. Each plaintiff also was given $200,000 for the
Hilton having inflicted severe emotional distress in the firings,
and will share the $30 million in punitive damages.
   ``Maybe the whole gambling business will learn something from
this,'' said Joseph Saunto, one of the fired workers. ``Maybe they
won't throw people away now when they're done with them.''
   The plaintiffs had sought nearly $50 million in actual and
punitive damages.

   A man who allegedly obtained credit cards in
the names of reporters whose bylines he saw in newspapers and
magazines has been arrested for investigation of submitting false
credit applications.
   Frank Charles Austin, 36, of Los Angeles, was accused of
submitting more than 30 credit applications to Sears Roebuck and JC
Penney, police said.
   Austin apparently received several cards and bought an unknown
amount of merchandise before his arrest, said police Detective
Reynaldo Morales.
   ``The amount of the fraud is not significant,'' Morales said.
``It is significant in that he was able to obtain the cards. It's
funny how easy it is to get a credit card.''
   Detectives began investigating last month after two unidentified
reporters at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner complained that someone
had tried to obtain charge cards using their names and place of
employment, the newspaper reported today.
   ``The suspect obtained names at random and using fictitious
information would submit fraudulent credit applications to several
credit-card granting companies,'' Detective Richard Van Nort said.
   Police said applications were submitted under the names of at
least 12 people, including writers for Los Angeles Times magazine
and California magazine.
   Nick D'Egidio, new accounts manager at JC Penney, said his office
received 15 applications and issued cards in five cases.
   Ron Ventresca, a fraud investigator for Sears, said the company
received 19 applications and one card was issued.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Gain On Soviet Wheat Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, gaining
on news that the Soviet Union was bidding for 515,000 metric tons of
U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Rumors of a Soviet bid for U.S. wheat had circulated during
Thursday's trading session and contributed to a late rally that
carried through into the opening today.
   Market analysts said that if the Agriculture Department accepts
the bid and the Soviets buy the wheat, the USDA probably will offer
them another 1 million metric tons of wheat under the government's
Export Enhancement Program.
   Continued warm, dry weather in the nation's midsection also
supported wheat futures by adding to fears of dry-weather damage to
the winter-wheat crop.
   The possibility of a dockworkers' strike next week in Brazil, the
world's second-largest soybean producer, prompted some buying of
soybean futures this morning.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.36 a bushel; corn was { cent
lower to } cent higher with March at $2.78{ a bushel; oats were }
cent to 1 cent higher with May at $2.12} a bushel; soybeans were 1
cent to 2 cents higher with March at $7.65{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .58 cent higher with April at 77.65
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .45 cent higher
with March at 81.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent lower to
.23 cent higher with April at 43.65 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .20 cent lower to .05 cent higher with March at 38
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Thursday.

have to be realistic to achieve the highest value for their assets.''
   That contrasts with FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman's statement
earlier this week that, ``We are not in the business of speculating
on real estate values.''
   Kemp said the bank could see some value in retaining assets,
particularly real estate, for a number of years until market prices
begin to recover.
   Acknowledging that many lenders have sustained losses from
attempting to outlast the Texas real estate slump, Kemp said he
believes disposal may be ill-advised.
   ``We are concerned that we would like to take more time with real
estate than the FDIC would like, but we're not sure we're right,''
he said. ``This is clearly a `How high is high?' question.''
   The government segregated the troubled loans and other assets
were placed into a separate pool, which NCNB Texas agreed to manage
last summer when it bought the former banks of First Republic.
   FDIC officials would not comment Thursday. In other situations,
regulators have adopted a strategy of making all assets available
for sale at market prices.

<HEAD>Judge Allowing Eastern To Pay Working Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge is allowing
strike-crippled Eastern Airlines to pay its working employees but
has made no provision for paying workers who are honoring Machinists
picket lines.
   Eastern attorney Bruce Zirinsky said Friday the carrier was freed
to compensate its employees working outside the United States,
namely in Central and South America and the Carribbean.
   Federal Judge Burton R. Lifland signed an order late Thursday
also authorizing Eastern to provide benefits and salary and to
reimburse expenses for other currently working Eastern employees.
   Eastern filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code on Thursday, the sixth day of a
crippling strike by its Machinists union and walkouts by its pilots
and flight attendants.
   The bankruptcy court must approve all of the company's
expenditures and transactions.
   The filing came on what would have been payday for the
Machinists, whose final pre-strike paychecks were withheld as part
of the Chapter 11 petition.

   The stock market declined broadly today on news
of continuing strong growth in employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.04 points to
2,278.39 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 405 up, 859
down and 520 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate
fell to 5.1 percent, a 15-year low, in February from 5.4 percent the
month before.
   The report also showed an increase of 289,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, topping most advance estimates.
   Wall Street had been anxiously awaiting the report all week,
hoping for new evidence that economic growth was slowing, taking
upward pressure off inflation and interest rates.
   So the figures were poorly received in both the bond and stock
markets. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, fell about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down { at 118[; General Electric, down { at 45; General

   Upjohn dropped \ to 29[ after losing 2\ points Thursday.
Responding to an analyst's report, the company said it was too soon

<HEAD>Decision Delayed on Railroad Sympathy Strikes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge who has temporarily barred
commuter railroad workers from honoring Eastern Airlines strikers'
picket lines has extended his order until he renders a final
decision.
   U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. extended his
self-imposed Friday midnight deadline indefinitely, until he rules
on whether it is legal for railroad workers to strike in sympathy
with airlines workers.
   Patterson gave no indication how long the temporary restraining
order would remain in effect or when he would issue a written
opinion on the complex labor dispute.
   His secretary, Kathleen Howley, said Patterson on Friday decided
to extend the deadline because the transcript of two days of
hearings he conducted was not immediately available and electrical
power in Manhattan's federal courthouse would be off for several
hours on Saturday for testing purposes.
   ``I hope to render an opinion as soon as possible,'' Patterson
told lawyers for both sides at the end of the second day of hearings
on Thursday, but gave no indication when that might be.
   Less than an hour after strikebound Eastern filed for Chapter 11
protection from creditors, Patterson heard competing legal arguments
from lawyers for four metropolitan area railroads and the unions
that represent their workers.
   The unions claim that federal law allows secondary picketing in
the railroad and airline industries.
   But the railroads maintain that the law requires their employees
to stay on the job until they go through a series of mandated
arbitration steps.
   On Sunday, at the request of the railroads, Patterson barred
workers at the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North and New Jersey
Transit from honoring the picket lines of Eastern strikers.
   Patterson later extended the temporary restraining order to
Amtrak workers.
   Eastern machinists had said they might set up picket lines at the
railroads as part of their strike but have not done so yet.
   ``This could bring the city to an absolute standstill,'' the
judge said near the end of Wednesday's session.
   Earlier Wednesday, the unions urged a federal appeals court to
overturn Patterson's order but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
declined to intervene until the lower court made a determination.
   In two days of lengthy hearings, Patterson heard railroad
officials testify that they would be forced to shut down if their
workers honored Eastern strikers' picket lines.
   The unions will not concede that point and maintain that they
will only ``urge and encourage'' their members to honor picket lines
_ not order them to do so.

<TEXT>
   Iraq's state airline has asked the
government to lift a ban on flights by Trans World Airlines so that
a Baghdad-Detroit route can be opened, a senior Iraqi Airways
official said.
   Nouri El Din Safi, Iraqi Airways' director general, said Thursday
he hoped the ban on TWA flights under an Arab boycott of firms that
do business with Israel soon would be lifted.
   He said that Iraqi and United States civil aviation authorities
reached agreement last year on starting flights between the
countries, but the accord was never implemented because of the TWA
ban.
   The U.S. government does not permit a foreign airline to operate
in the United States if an American airline is banned from operating
in that country.
   Safi said the planned flight would link Baghdad and Detroit,
which has a large Iraqi community, with a stop in Paris.

<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The finance minister says that if
wealthy countries don't do something about reducing Latin America's
debt, populists and demagogues will gain political power in the
region.
   The minister, Mailson da Nobrega, said: ``People will believe in
messiahs. Radical groups will replace moderate ones'' now grappling
with Latin America's $400 billion foreign debt.
   Recent riots in Venezeula, which left more than 250 people dead,
were a ``clear alert'' that the current debt situation is ``socially
and politically unbearable,'' da Nobrega said.
   ``Latin American debt is being paid at the cost of low salaries
for Latin Americans. The industrialized countries don't understand
this,'' he said.
   Brazil, owing $115 billion, mostly to big U.S banks, is the Third
World's biggest debtor.
   Brazil, which in 1985 returned to civilian government after 21
years of military rule, is preparing for presidential elections on
Nov. 15, the first such popular vote in Brazil since 1960.
   Political parties still must hold conventions to choose
candidates, but media polls show leftist leaders are very popular.
   Da Nobrega said news reports that the Bush administration is
preparing new policies for dealing with Third World debt are ``very
positive.''
   ``This seems to be the maturing of an idea that there must be
something more than just the debtors and the banks in the resolution
of the debt: the involvement of governments of industrialized
countries and of international financial institutions,'' he said.
   Latin American governments now in power ``realize that
confrontation is not the answer,'' da Nobrega said.
   But he added that these current administrations need
``corresponding measures'' from the developed world ``to reduce the
amount of Latin American debt and provide a flow of new financial
resources to Latin America.''

   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca dropped
by the company's stamping plant in this northern Detroit suburb
Friday to hand out profit-sharing checks to four workers.
   Iacocca presented the checks while standing in front of a
stamping press being tested for operation in July. He congratulated
the workers and they thanked him during the five-minute ceremony.
   The chairman of the nation's third-largest automaker then was
hustled past reporters and photographers for a brief tour through
some of the 630,000 square feet of manufacturing space. Before he
left, Iacocca was serenaded in the plant's executive garage by six
Chrysler workers singing a tune called ``Committed to be the Best.''
   The company handed out more than $59.9 million in profit-sharing
checks to about 82,000 workers, or about $725 each. Ford Motor Co.
distributed profit-sharing checks Tuesday averaging about $2,800
apiece, and next Tuesday General Motors Corp. will mail checks of
slightly more than $250 per employee.
   The checks, called for in labor agreements among the Big Three
and the United Auto Workers union, are based on the companies'
financial performance in North America. It's the first time that
workers for all of the companies have received the payments in the
same year.

<HEAD>Cocoa Consumers Expected to Call For Levy Suspension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consuming countries are expected to call for the
suspension of the current levy on traded cocoa at International
Cocoa Organization talks opening here Monday, delegates said Friday.
   They are expected to argue a formal suspension is warranted
because key cocoa producers have unilaterally stopped paying their
share.
   The levy of $30 a metric ton is collected by producers when they
sell to cocoa organization consumers, and by consumers when they buy
from non-members.
   The money is supposed to be forwarded to the cocoa organization,
headquartered in London, to meet operational costs and to finance
possible market-intervention measures.
   The organization lacks the money to implement a proposed
stockpiling scheme to stabilize prices in the current oversupplied
market because of producer arrears totaling more than $80 million.
   Producer debts, the bulk owed by the Ivory Coast and Brazil, have
created a feeling of injustice among consuming countries, delegates
said, requesting anonymity.
   Consumers were disappointed when producers at the last meeting of
the 41-nation cocoa organization here in January rejected a proposal
to suspend the levy.
   Traders said that they did not expect the talks to produce any
market-moving developments.
   ``International action to support prices looks likely to remain
paralyzed for the foreseeable future,'' said one.
   All leading consuming countries except the United States are
members of the cocoa organization. The only key producers that do
not belong are Malaysia and Indonesia.

   Eastern Airlines, one day after filing for
bankruptcy protection, said today it will resume 80 flights because
more pilots and flight attendants are crossing picket lines.
   Meanwhile, thousands of Eastern ticket holders scrambled to get
refunds or fly on other carriers. And a judge in New York today
extended his order barring commuter railroad workers from honoring
Eastern Machinists' picket lines.
   Beginning Sunday and Monday, Eastern will resume its profitable
service between Miami and 13 Latin American cities and restore
flights linking Boston and Washington; Miami and San Juan, Puerto
Rico; Miami and New York's LaGuardia Airport; and LaGuardia and
Montreal, said Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak in Miami.
   ``We have a number of pilots, a number of flight attendants, and
in fact they're coming back in higher numbers,'' Eastern President
Phil Bakes said in announcing the new flights on NBC's ``Today''
show.
   The exact number of employees who will be recalled to work the
restored flights has not been determined, Ms. Ceremsak said.
   Eastern has been flying 62 flights a day during the strike on its
Northeast shuttle linking Boston, New York and Washington, and three
a week from Miami to Buenos Aires and Santiago. Eastern had 1,040
flights daily before the strike.
   ``We are going to rebuild this airline in prudent, sensible
increments and get our men and women back to work so they can
support their families,'' Bakes said.
   A spokesman for the Machinists union, Wally Haber, charged that
Eastern had brought 100 Continental pilots into Miami and was
outfitting them with Eastern uniforms. He denied that Eastern pilots
were crossing picket lines.
   The bankruptcy action by the nation's seventh-largest airline,
announced Thursday on the sixth day of a punishing strike by
Machinists union over Eastern's demands for concessions, was the
fifth biggest Chapter 11 filing in history in terms of company
assets.
   The move sparked a new wave of denunciations by union leaders,
who called Eastern chief Frank Lorenzo a ``robber baron.''
   Machinists also called for a public boycott of Eastern's sister
carrier, Continental Airlines, set up pickets against Continental in
Houston, and said they would oppose Eastern's reorganization plan
and any sale of assets.
   No pickets were reported at Continental's area of New York's La
Guardia airport, but Continental's telephone lines there were jammed
as people sought alternate travel arrangements.
   The first Eastern Airlines shuttle to leave Boston for New York
and Washington today with a new $12 one-way fare in effect had 92
people on board, said a spokesman for the Massachusetts Port
Authority, which operates Logan International Airport. Phil
Orlandella said previous shuttle flights since the machinists strike
carried as few as seven passengers, on planes equipped to carry as
many as 177 passengers.
   In New York, U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. extended
a Friday midnight deadline indefinitely, until he rules on whether
it is legal for railroad workers to strike in support of Eastern
workers. A federal appeals court panel in Philadelphia has issued a
similar ban.
   Angry and confused passengers, meanwhile, confronted Eastern
ticket agents as well as travel agencies, often getting little
satisfaction as they learned they might have to wait on a long line
of unsecured creditors for a refund or pay higher fares on other
carriers.
   But many service people, as well as travel agents, were as
confused as the ticket holders about the effects of the action in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, which temporarily frees the
airline of the debt obligations.
   ``This has been one of those days that we all hope would never
happen,'' said Phil Davidoff, president-elect of the 23,000-member
American Society of Travel Agents.
   In Miami, ticket agent Marion Gordon and two co-workers at
Eastern's office could only respond to angry customers by saying
they had no money for refunds.
   ``I am an old lady and I'm stranded on Miami Beach,'' said Rose
Aolt of New York City. ``I have no money for another ticket.''
   ``You'll just have to wait and see,'' Gordon answered.
   Under the Chapter 11 filing, the bankruptcy court must approve
ticket refunds, said Ms. Ceremsak, adding that she did not know how
the process would work. The would-be passengers, who hold about $200
million worth of tickets, fall behind bigger, secured creditors in
priority in the eyes of the court.
   But chances remained good that if the passenger's destination
were a popular one, another carrier would honor the ticket, although
possibly at a higher price.
   In addition, passengers who bought tickets with a major credit
card probably won't have to stand in line at the courthouse since a
federal law protects consumers who make credit card purchases but
fail to receive goods or services.
   The best passengers could do was to trade Eastern tickets for
travel before March 15 for seats on its sister airline, Continental.
   ``But beyond next week, I don't know,'' Gordon told customers.
``We don't even know if we're going to get paid.''
   Eastern, meanwhile, said it will attempt to get as many planes
back in the air as possible in order to make ``old tickets good.''
The company also plans to renegotiate agreements with other carriers
to honor Eastern tickets.
   As late as Wednesday, Miami-based Eastern had insisted that a
Chapter 11 filing remained a last resort in its effort to survive
the strike, which is costing the airline about $4 million a day.
   Lorenzo, at a news conference Thursday, blamed ``the damage that
has been caused by the pilots' union'' for the decision to seek
protection. The machinists' strike, which started Saturday following
a 17-month dispute over wage concessions, has been honored by most
Eastern pilots and flight attendants.
   The 3,600 pilots are critical to Eastern's operations, and their
support of the 8,500 machinists forced the airline to shut down
virtually all its operations Monday and lay off some 9,500 non-union
employees.
   The airline faces a ``cash crisis'' that can only be averted and
stabilized by turning to the bankruptcy court, Bakes said.
   The bankruptcy filing is designed to give Eastern a reprieve from
debts and the threat of lawsuits by creditors while it tries to
restructure and extricate itself from the worst crisis in its
60-year history.
   Eastern management, listing more than $4.5 billion in net assets,
$3.39 billion in liabilities and 15,696 creditors, insisted it
intends to restore the company through the bankruptcy proceeding,
though in a smaller form.
   ``We intend to operate our airline: make no mistake about that,''
Bakes said.
   Lorenzo and Bakes pledged that all creditors would be paid in
full; shareholders would receive ``fair value''; passengers would be
protected; and as many employees as possible would return to work.
Eastern had 31,200 employees before the strike.
   The two Eastern officials avoided specific comment on reports
that Lorenzo rival Carl Icahn had been asked by Eastern strikers to
consider a buyout of Eastern.
   The Chapter 11 filing would still allow a takeover but would
force approval by the bankruptcy court as well as by creditors,
making such a transaction cumbersome. Unions would also have a say.
   Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., has said he would
consider requests to acquire Eastern only if Eastern allowed the
negotiations.

   Share prices closed higher Friday, shaking off the
depressing influence of early losses on Wall Street, as buying
interest emerged at the beginning of a new trading account during
which Britain's fiscal 1990 budget is to be presented.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 9.3
points, or 0.4 percent, higher at 2,085.2.
   The index gained as much as 14.5 points at midday but later fell
back to its lowest level, up 3.4 points, shortly after New York
opened for business.
   For the week, the index gained 26 points. It also was up 65.7
points over the course of the two-week trading account that ended
Friday. London's Stock Exchange divides trading into two-week and
three-week trading periods for accounting purposes.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 10.8 points at 1,724.9.
The Financial Times 500-share index rose 5.95 points to close at
1,190.44.
   Volume was a relatively brisk 655 million shares, its best level
for the past month, and up from 483.9 million shares on Thursday.
   Several dealers voiced surprise at the market's resilience in the
face of subsequent losses on Wall Street.
   But other dealers said the London market was ignoring external
factors, at least until Tuesday's budget speech by Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson is safely out of the way.
   Most private economists expect Lawson to present a conservative
budget, with relatively small tax cuts, to prevent the economy from
overheating.

<HEAD>59 Wiring and Plumbing Problems in Boeing Jets Reported Since 1981</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Aviation Administration officials say they
have received 59 reports of miswiring or faulty plumbing in
cargo-hold and engine fire-suppression systems of commercial jets
made by the Boeing Co. since 1981.
   The first problem was reported in 1983 and the latest on Thursday.
   FAA officials said 32 of the problems were found by airlines
before Jan. 31, when the agency issued an airworthiness directive
for checks of 741 jets in the United States, while the other 27 were
found afterward. The FAA also has heard from many foreign carriers
flying some of the other 836 Boeing jets that were built in the same
period.
   Boeing is in the process of redesigning some parts and
overhauling test procedures to try to prevent future errors.
   Meanwhile, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported today that a
letter dated Jan. 26 from Leroy Keith, local manager of the FAA's
Aircraft Certification Service, to Boeing officials renewed concerns
about delays in reporting safety problems to the federal agency.
   Boeing learned of crossed wires in a 757 cargo compared
fire-suppression system last August but reported the problem four
months later, Keith noted.
   ``Until now, I had been encouraged that there were definite
improvements,'' his letter said. ``The 757 issue, however, indicates
that more needs to be done.''
   The newspaper also said an internal FAA briefing paper cited
several factors in the plumbing and wiring mistakes.
   Fire-extinguishing system connectors were identical in size,
making it easier to misconnect them, and Boeing's functional test
procedure did not include the completed systems to insure that the
proper connector was attached to the corresponding plug on fire
bottles.
   ``Results of this FAA inspection have identified several areas of
concern within the Boeing quality control system,'' the briefing
paper said.

<TEXT>
   The nation's unemployment rate in February
plunged to 5.1 percent, the lowest point in 15 years, as employers
created 289,000 new jobs in a sign of the economy's continued
strength, the government reported today.
   The jobless rate was down 0.3 percentage points from January,
hitting 5.1 percent for first time since May 1974, the Labor
Department said. The rate last was lower in December 1973, when it
hit 4.9 percent.
   At the same time, employers created 289,000 new nonfarm jobs last
month, with the gains confined to service-producing industries,
according to a separate survey of business payrolls.
   February's job-growth figure reflected some fallback after
payrolls grew by a robust 415,000 jobs in January, when employment
was spurred by unusually mild weather. January's figure was revised
upward from an initial estimate of 408,000 new jobs.
   The latest figures provided fresh evidence that the economy
continues to command strength in the seventh year of its record
peacetime expansion despite widespread anticipation of an impending
slowdown.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the drop in
the unemployement rate ``good news'' and said ``jobs are still the
best barometer of a sound economy.''
   ``While the numbers are volatile on a monthly basis, the economy
can continue to create jobs and inflation remain in check,''
Fitzwater said.
   Daniel T. Van Dyke, senior economist for Bank of America in San
Francisco, said February's strong numbers are ``good in the near
term'' but raise concern about growing inflationary pressures from
tight labor markets.
   ``Certainly numbers like these do nothing to suggest pressure
will be coming off labor markets,'' he said. ``The labor force just
isn't growing fast enough to sustain employment growth at the rate
we're experiencing right now.''
   The unemployment rate had hovered around 5.3 percent and 5.4
percent for the prior five months.
   Janet L. Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
said in testimony prepared for Congress that ``many wondered whether
it was possible for the rate to decline any further or whether the
labor market had already expanded as far as it could go.''
   She said that while the decline was important, most of the
decrease was among groups whose jobless rates tend to be erratic,
notably youth and Hispanics.
   ``We need another month or so of data to determine whether this
single month's phenomenon will be sustained,'' Ms. Norwood said.
   Overall, the civilian labor force contracted by 247,000 people
last month to 123.2 million, while 142,000 workers found jobs,
according to the department's monthly sample of households, from
which the jobless rate is calculated.
   With the rise in employment, 62.9 percent of working-age
Americans held jobs, matching the record high level set in January.
   February's job growth was paced by gains in service-producing
sectors, while employment in goods-producing industries decreased
slightly due to a weather-related decline in construction.
   There were 321,000 new jobs in the service-producing sector of
the economy, including gains in health and business services.
   Construction employment was down 22,000 jobs due to harsh weather
after a strong surge in January that had been attributed largely to
mild weather.
   Manufacturing employment was down 8,000 jobs after steadily
increasing since September.
   In figures closely watched for signs of inflation, the report
showed that seasonally adjusted average hourly earnings of
nonsupervisory employees were up a slim 0.1 percent and average
weekly earnings declined 0.2 percent in February.
   A separate unemployment calculation including the 1.7 million
members of the armed forces stationed in the United States also
stood at 5.1 percent in February, down from 5.4 percent a month
earlier.
   In the civilian population, the jobless rate among whites was 4.3
percent last month, down from 4.6 percent in January, while the
unemployment rate for blacks was 11.9 percent, down from 12 percent.
   The jobless rate among Hispanics plunged to 6.8 percent from 8.4
percent in January.
   The rate for teen-agers dropped by 1.6 percentage points to 14.8
percent, while the unemployment rate for young adults aged 20 to 24
fell 1.2 points to 8.1 percent.
   Analysts have long been forecasting an economic slowdown, but
most reports at the start of 1989 have indicated the economy
continues to demonstrate strong momentum.
   ``We've had strong growth in employment that suggests we're going
into the first quarter with significant gains already in our
pocket,'' economist James Annable of First National Bank of Chicago
said in advance of today's report. ``We're not going to get a
significant slowdown in growth in the first quarter.''
   Analysts now expect the slowdown to materialize later this year
as higher interest rates begin to take their toll.
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up interest
rates in an effort to restrain excessive economic growth and keep
inflation in check.
   The Fed's latest round of credit-tightening came after reports
showed consumer prices rose 0.6 percent during January and wholesale
prices shot up 1 percent. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan blamed the
increases in part on acceleration of wage increases in the tight
labor market.

<HEAD>GAO Report Says Land Sold for Pennies on the Dollar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has sold to private
interests thousands of acres in the West worth a thousand times the
land's selling price, according to a published report.
   The Arizona Republic reported in today's editions that the
transactions, described in a report by the General Accounting
Office, are allowed under a 117-year-old law designed to promote
miing in the West.
   According to the GAO report, the Republic said, at least three
Phoenix-area tracts are involved, including a 19-acre site that sold
in 1987 for $47 and now is estimated to be worth $376,000 to $3.8
million. That site was bought by Melluzzo and Nichols granite
operation, the Republic said.
   Other Phoenix deals reported by the Republic include the 1985
sale of 15 acres for $38 but estimated to be worth $272,000. It was
bought by Phoenix Sand &amp; Rock. The Republic also cited sale of 40
acres near Mesa in 1983 to another sand and gravel operation,
Johnson &amp; Johnson, for $100 but estimated to be worth $400,000.
   The GAO said that since 1970, the federal government has
collected $4,500 for land valued in 1988 at $14 million to $48
million, the newspaper reported.
   The land was sold under the patent provisions of the Mining Law
of 1872, which says a patent holder owns the land and the minerals
contained in it.
   To acquire a patent, a person must meet certain minimal
requirements intended to show mining activity, but critics say the
requirements are lax and meaningless.
   The report urged that the law be changed to prohibit land sales
under the loophole.
   Among the federal land sold was an inactive 160-acre mining claim
near the Keystone, Colo., ski resort that was patented in 1983 for
$2.50 an acre. Last year, 44 acres of that tract were offered for
sale at $11,000 an acre.
   ``This is outrageous,'' said Rep. Nick Joe Rahall, D-W.Va., who
heads the Interior subcommittee on mining and natural resources,
where the report was released Wednesday.
   ``At $2.50 an acre, these valuable federal lands are being
transferred out of public ownership for fast-food-hamburger
prices,'' a statement released by Rahall said.
   ``The intent of the mining law is to facilitate mineral
extraction, not serve as a vehicle for land speculation and
profiteering at the public's expense,'' he added.
   Keith Knoblock, vice president of the 450-member American Mining
Congress, said the report was misleading and contained factual
errors. He added that changing the law would hurt the struggling
mining industry.
   He said the GAO ``decided what conclusions it wanted to reach and
then presented information to justify those conclusions.''
   Since passage of the Mining Law, the federal government has sold
about 3.2 million acres, an area about the size of Connecticut.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., told Rahall's subcommittee
Wednesday that he supports legislation increasing patent fees from
the current $2.50 and $5 an acre.

<HEAD>Conable Proposes Debt Relief for Mexico</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Third World Debt Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the World Bank called Friday for
special relief to Mexico from its debt burden of more than $100
billion.
   ``Mexico has indicated a willingness to engage in major
reforms,'' said Barber Conable. ``It has substantial prospects. It
also has substantial debt, and it has lived up to its obligations.''
   ``The international financial community should offer Mexico a
wider than traditional range of options to finance its requirements
over the next few years,'' Conable said.
   His first suggestion was that there should be a signficant
reduction in Mexico's debt, the largest in the Third World after
Brazil's. Current loans to Mexico should be exchanged at a discount
for long-term bonds, he said. This would be a form of debt
forgiveness by the commercial banks to which the bulk of Mexico's
debt is owed.
   Mexico would have less to repay when the bonds came due, and
interest paid in the interval would also be reduced.
   The World Bank, owned by 151 governments, is the major source of
aid to Third World countries. Under a plan proposed by then-Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III in 1985, it is in charge of helping
debtor countries map new policies to put them in a better position
to carry their debt burden.
   Conable also suggested:
   _``Exit bonds,'' to be taken by creditor banks at a discount from
the sums now owed them, enabling some banks to get out of lending to
Mexico. This would also reduce the principal and interest Mexico has
to pay.
   _A ``debt-equity swap program,'' which would allow banks to use
the dollars they have lent to Mexico to buy shares in Mexican
businesses
   _Strong support from international bodies like his own bank and
its sister organization, the International Monetary Fund, to support
Mexico's austerity policies. Though Conable did not specify, this
support would presumably include additional loans on more favorable
terms than those offered by commerical banks.
   _New tax, trade and banking regulations by creditor countries to
encourage private investment from abroad that will help Mexico's
income to grow.
   ``New money will be needed in Mexico's case even after
significant debt reduction,'' Conable added.
   He said that his bank and other international bodies cannot
furnish the needed money alone, implying that new loans from
commercial banks will also be needed.

   Delays in shipping Boeing's new 747-400 jumbo jet
have pushed up prices for used 747s and made them nearly as scarce
as the new models, industry officials say.
   ``It's a seller's market, and there just aren't any planes out
there right now,'' said Bill Avery, editor of Cargo Facts, an
industry newsletter published in Seattle.
   The first 747-400 was to have been delivered in December. But to
date, just one 747-400 has been delivered, to Northwest Airlines,
although a number of the planes are close to completion. Boeing
hopes to deliver 57 of the planes by the end of the year.
   Twenty-two customers have ordered 192 of the advanced planes,
which can carry 412 passengers more than 8,000 miles.
   Boeing has cited late deliveries by suppliers, complex new
avionics, an inexperienced work force and a decision to win
simultaneous certification for several versions of the new plane as
reasons for the delays.
   Because of the delays, airlines are holding on to their older
planes. As a result, just eight of the more than 700 older 747s are
for sale worldwide, and most of those are spoken for, says Avmark, a
Virginia-based aircraft appraisal company.
   Higher demand also has meant higher used-plane prices, says
Avmark's Paul Turk.
   ``Boeing 747-200s that used to sell for about $27.5 million now
are commanding up to $32 million,'' Turk said. ``Some even have gone
as high as $38 million.''
   The 747 went into service in January 1970, and the
larger-capacity 747-200 in November 1971. Many 747-200s sold for
less than $30 million new.
   Newer used planes, when available, sell for much more, such as
$40 million for a 747-200 model that can be used for passengers and
cargo, and $75 million for a used 747-300, a model that went into
service in February 1983.
   The eight planes now on the market aren't going to be available
until next year because their owners, KLM Dutch Airlines and
Singapore Airlines, have had their 747-400s delayed by Boeing, Turk
said.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the U.S. House banking
committee called today for the resignation of federal savings and
loan regulators after hearing a government report that the thrift
crisis could have been handled more efficiently.
   U.S. Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking,
Finance, and Urban Affairs Committee, which is conducting a field
hearing on thrift problems, has been critical of M. Danny Wall, the
chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Gonzalez' comments seeking the resignation came after testimony
by Frederick D. Wolf, assistant comptroller geneneral of the General
Accounting Office, who said that the handling of the savings and
loan problems could have been handled in a less-costly manner.
   Wolf said the deficit for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp. had at least quadrupled between 1987 and 1988 when it began
takeover of insolvent thrifts.
   ``Those deals were terribly expensive and our thinking is that
there could have been more ways you could have done it less
costly,'' he said.
   ``We are still in the process of doing the audit and the number
may be higher than lower,'' Wolf said.
   Gonzalez interrupted Wolf's testimony to say that the new figures
contradict testimony by Wall and others before the committee earlier
this year.
   ``I just feel under these circumstances, the Congress, and
therefore the public, have been disgracefully misinformed. The
persons responsible should step aside at this time,'' Gonzalez said,
reiterating his criticism of Wall.
   Federal and state officials are scheduled to testify in the
two-day hearing looking into the savings and loan crisis. Wall is
not among the witnesses scheduled to testify.
   So far this year, 118 savings and loan institutions have been
taken over by federal regulators, including 36 in Texas.
   Wolf said that he believed the administration's projection to
spend $100 billion to rectify the thrift crisis was adequate.

<HEAD>Japan Not Worried That U.S. Will Set Tougher Trade Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan does not fear a tougher trade policy will
emerge from Washington because the United States would be unlikely
to further restrict trade with Japan while it promotes a free-trade
policy with the rest of the world, officials say.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills has established a task
force that is considering ``managed trade'' as part of a review of
how to reduce the United States' $52 billion trade deficit with
Japan.
   A policy of managed trade could include specific targets for
increased Japanese purchases of U.S. products and reductions in the
trade imbalance.
   But Japanese officials do not appear worried that such changes
will be implemented.
   ``I think Mrs. Hills has reservations about managed trade and her
basic stance is still toward free trade,'' said Shin Yasunobe, an
official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).
   ``The United States would have a difficult time promoting its
basic commitment to multilateral free trade and at the same time
moving toward managed trade with Japan,'' added Yasunobe, deputy
director of the Americas and Oceanic division at MITI.
   Other ministry officials see recent criticisms of Japan by Mrs.
Hills as politically motivated. It is necessary for her to display a
tough attitude toward Japan, they say, to win approval for the team
she wants in the new administration.
   They concede, however, that she may turn out to be tough.
   MITI officials see a trade policy vacuum right now in the U.S.
government. With few U.S. officials concerned with formulating
economic and trade policy in place, they believe Mrs. Hills has
little support currently for setting new policies.
   Ministry officials say they don't expect anything concrete to
emerge in trade policy from the United States until mid-May, after
Mrs. Hills' deputies are confirmed and have been briefed.
   When that happens, the two sides can have a meaningful exchange
of views, they say.
   ``We do not support managed trade,'' said Yoshio Nakamura, head
of U.S.-Japan economic relations at Keidanren, Japan's powerful
Federation of Economic Organizations.
   But, he added, Japan already has ``managed trade'' with the
United States in automobiles, steel and semiconductors. Japan has
adhered to voluntary restraint agreements for steel and auto exports
to the United States for several years. It agreed in 1986 to
encourage foreign semiconductor sales in Japan.
   While the United States complains that Japanese markets are
closed to its products, Japanese government officials and business
leaders believe there is little correlation between market access
and the trade imbalance.
   ``Since 1980 we have, in response to U.S. pressure, enhanced
access to Japanese markets,'' Nakamura said. ``But while Japanese
markets have become more open, the trade imbalance has worsened.''
   ``It is almost nonsense to measure the openness of the market by
looking only at the trade imbalance,'' said Yasunobe, the MITI
official. ``Even Mrs. Hills admits the imbalance is the outcome of
macroeconomic policies and structures.''
   Greater coordination of these policies is needed, the officials
say, along with a reduction in the U.S. budget deficit, reduced
consumer demand in the United States, and greater stimulation of
Japan's domestic economy.
   Nakamura said what happens in the trade relationship between the
two countries will likely depend on trade statistics in the coming
months.
   ``If they worsen, the frustration level will be higher in the
U.S. Congress and administration, and Japan will be in a bad
position. Hills may have to take strong action against Japan,''
Nakamura said.

   Japan on Saturday welcomed a new U.S. plan to deal
with international debt and pledged its financial backing.
   ``I strongly support the U.S. proposals, including voluntary
market-based debt and debt service reduction and repatriation of
flight capital,'' Finance Minister Natsuo Murayama said in a
statement released early Saturday.
   He said Japan would back the new plan by matching the loans
provided by the International Monetary Fund to debtor nations.
   ``We are intending to support the proposal financially, including
increasing and strengthening parallel lending by the Export-Import
Bank of Japan with the IMF to the debtor countries taking advantage
of the strengthened debt strategy which includes provisions for debt
reduction and debt service reduction,'' Murayama said.
   Japan was closely consulted by the U.S. Treasury on the new aid
plan and some of its proposals were reflected in the strategy,
Finance Ministry officials said.
   The plan included earlier proposals by Japan for midterm measures
to deal with the burden of debtor countries, as well as interest
payment schemes and a concept of responsibility-sharing by banks and
the private and public sectors, they said.

   The stock market retreated today, faced with news
of continuing strong growth in employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 14.11 points to
2,277.32 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 481 up, 884 down and
514 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate
fell to 5.1 percent, a 15-year low, in February from 5.4 percent the
month before.
   The report also showed an increase of 289,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, topping most advance estimates.
   Wall Street had been anxiously awaiting the report all week,
hoping for new evidence that economic growth was slowing, taking
upward pressure off inflation and interest rates.
   So the figures were poorly received in both the bond and stock
markets. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, fell about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down | at 118; General Electric, down | at 44~; General
Motors, down { at 85, and American Express, down } at 29~.
   Upjohn dropped ] to 29 after losing 2\ points Thursday.
Responding to an analyst's report, the company said it was too soon

<TEXT>
   A Microsoft Corp. shareholder has filed a federal
class-action lawsuit alleging the computer software publisher and
two of its officers violated U.S. securities laws by misleading
stockholders about the company's financial outlook.
   Microsoft shareholders were damaged when the price of the stock
plummeted 13.7 percent Tuesday after Microsoft announced it faced
lower-than-expected third-quarter sales and profits, according to
allegations in the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle by
Bruce Adelstein.
   The suit says Microsoft gave no indication in the weeks before
the announcement that it was facing any problems. It seeks
undetermined compensatory and punitive damages.
   ``We are reviewing the plaintiff's claims and we believe them to
be entirely without merit,'' William H. Neukom, Microsoft vice
president of law and corporate affairs, said in a news release
Friday. ``Microsoft intends to defend the case vigorously. The case
is now before the courts and Microsoft will not offer comment
outside of this statement.''
   In addition to Microsoft, the suit names as plaintiffs Jon A.
Shirley, Microsoft president and chief operating officer, and
Francis J. Gaudette, the company's vice president, treasurer and
chief financial officer. Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill
Gates is not listed as a defendant.
   Microsoft's stock, traded over the counter, dropped by $8.50 a
share to $53.50 Tuesday after the company announced it expected
lower profits and sales for its third quarter ending March 31st. It
would be the first time quarterly profits declined since the company
went public three years ago.
   Microsoft blamed the lower forecast on delays in shipping new
versions of its word-processing software, Microsoft Word, and
overstocking by key distributors.
   Microsoft predicted third-quarter sales at $180 million to $200
million, down from the $200 million to $215 million expected by many
market analysts.
   The company had sales of $161.8 million and profits of $37.3
million in the third quarter of last year. It said it expected
profits for the current quarter ``to be somewhat less than a year
ago.''
   Adelstein's Seattle attorney, Steven Berman, said the suit
alleges that in a quarterly report filed Feb. 10 with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and in conferences with investors and
analysts that month, Microsoft and its executives gave no indication
of the inventory problems or that shipments of the new Word versions
would be delayed.
   The suit says that ``as a direct result of the company's belated
disclosures'' of the problems Tuesday, ``the market's response to
Microsoft's announcement was swift and severe.''
   It alleges the Microsoft officers misled stockholders to protect
their jobs, enhance the value of their Microsoft stock and holdings,
``and cover up their own prior misconduct and mismangement of
Microsoft and avoid being held responsible.''
   The class named in the suit covers investors who bought Microsoft
stock between Jan. 19 and March 6. Berman said he didn't know how
many people that covered, although 19 million shares of Microsoft
were traded during that period.
   Adelstein bought 1,400 shares of Microsoft on Feb. 10, when the
stock closed at $63 a share, Berman said.
   ``He bought on the upswing because he read the news and so forth
and was pretty unhappy at what happened,'' Berman said.
   With the $8.50-a-share drop, Adelstein's stock would have lost
$11,900 in value on Tuesday. In contrast, Shirley, listed in the
suit as owning 638,400 shares, faced an on-paper loss of $5.4
million, while Gaudette, listed as having 33,334 shares, saw his
stock drop by $283,339.
   Gates, with over 20 million shares, took a paper loss of about
$174 million.

<HEAD>New Season Wheat Output Could Reach Record Level</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recovery in world wheat production to possibly a
record 540 million metric tons in the 1989-90 season was tentatively
forecast Friday by the International Wheat Council.
   The council _ one of the world's leading wheat forecasting bodies
_ revised its 1988-89 world wheat crop estimate to 504 million from
502 million in January.
   This compares with 512 million produced in 1987-88 and the record
538 million in 1986-87.
   The estimate for the season running from June 1989 to July 1990
is based on an expected increase in planting and good growing
conditions, the council said.
   ``It must be stressed that the final outcome will depend on the
weather and crop developments over the next few months,'' the
council said, noting that sowing in some parts of the world has not
yet begun.
   Production forecasts for 1989-90 include the Soviet Union 90.0
million tons (84.5 million estimated for 1988-89), China 89.0
million (87.0 million), the European Economic Community 86.2 million
(86.1 million), the United States 65.0 million (49.3 million), India
49.0 million (44.5 million), Canada 26.0 million (15.5 million),
Turkey 19.0 million (18.5 million), Australia 14.0 million (14.3
million), Argentina 8.2 million (8.0 million) and Brazil 5.0 million
(5.9 million).
   For the 1988-89 season, output of coarse grains _ principally
corn _ is now estimated at 725 million tons this season (800 million
tons in 1987-88).
   World wheat trade in 1988-89 is estimated to fall to 98 million
tons from a record 106 million in 1987-88 because of lower Soviet
and Indian imports.
   Soviet wheat imports are put at 14.0 million (22.0 million last
season) and Indian imports at 2.1 million (3.0 million).
   The council expects China to overtake the Soviet Union as the
world's biggest wheat importer in 1988-89, buying a record 16.6
million tons compared with 15.3 million in 1987-88.
   World coarse grain trade in 1988-89 is put at 97.0 million tons,
against 86.0 million last season.
   Soviet imports of coarse grains in 1988-89 are estimated at 21.0
million tons (9.0 million in 1987-88).

   Top American trade negotiators met
Friday with officials of the European Economic Community for a
series of talks focusing on the troublesome issue of farm subsidies.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and Trade Representative
Carla Hills met for about two hours with the Common Market's top
foreign affairs official, Frans Andriessen, and its agriculture
chief, Ray MacSharry.
   Nico Wegter, spokesman for the 12-nation trading bloc, said the
discussions were held in a ``constructive atmosphere'' but provided
no details.
   The officials were having dinner together Friday night and
continuing their talks Saturday morning. Yeutter and Mrs. Hills were
scheduled to leave Brussels later Saturday.
   The officials are trying to find ways to ease a conflict between
the United States and the community over government subsidies to
farmers before the resumption of international trade talks April 5
in Geneva. The dispute has stalled the Uruguay Round negotiations,
held under the auspices of the 96-nation General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   The United States wants the Common Market to end import barriers
and export and domestic farm subsidies that it says distort trade.
It initially demanded the subsidies be eliminated by the year 2000.
   An American proposal offered last month to the Europeans seeks to
gradually lower farm subsidies. A U.S. statement said the plan
``does not use language strongly opposed by the (community) that
specifically calls for elimination of trade-distorting subsidies by
a certain date.''
   The community has refused to agree on a date for withdrawing all
supports and wants the United States to include short-term reform
measures in the debate.
   The Common Market provides hefty subsidies to its 18 million
farmers through guaranteed prices for many of their crops. It also
gives exporters help so costlier European farm products can compete
with lower world prices.
   The United States complains the export subsidies have helped the
community increase its share of the world market. It has responded
by setting up its own Export Enhancement Program.
   A year ago, European leaders began the politically sensitive task
of curbing farm payments. They agreed to limit the maximum annual
amount of expenditure on price guarantees over five years. U.S.
officials say the measures were not enough to fix a fundamentally
flawed policy.
   Europeans argue they cannot leave the bulk of their farmers to
compete without help in the world market. Their farms, they say, are
on average smaller than in the United States and need extra aid.
   The four officials held a round of get-acquainted talks in
Feburary in Washington during which they agreed to set up a task
force to try to resolve a dispute over a European ban on imports of
hormone-treated meat from the United States. The task force has
until early May to complete its findings.
   The Common Market imposed on Jan. 1 a ban on imports of meat from
cattle treated with growth hormones. The United States refused to
comply and instead slapped stiff duties on a variety of European
products.
   The Europeans have threatened to impose their own retaliatory
measures _ tough tariffs on American walnuts and dried fruit _ if
the conflict isn't resolved.
   The hormone ban was imposed because of European concerns the
stimulants pose a health risk to consumers, a claim the United
States disputes.
   The ban is expected to block imports of about $100 million worth
of beef and beef byproducts from the United States. The trading
partners totaled about $165 billion worth of trade in 1988.

<HEAD>S&amp;P Lowers Rating on RJR Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. announced Friday it has
lowered its rating on $5 billion of RJR Nabisco Inc. debt because of
the $24.53 billion leveraged buyout of the food and tobacco company
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   Standard &amp; Poor's, a credit rating service, said it was lowering
RJR Nabisco's A rating to BB.
   Preferred stock and convertible debentures to be issued in
connection with the buyout are expected to receive a B plus rating,
Standard &amp; Poor's said.
   Standard &amp; Poor's announced it was reassessing RJR Nabisco's debt
rating last fall, after the company's managers said they were
considering a leveraged buyout of the firm. Management lost a
bidding war to Kohlberg Kravis, which is in the process of carrying
out its own LBO.
   A leveraged buyout _ which is accomplished with largely borrowed
funds _ sharply increases the debt load of a company and can raise
questions about its ability to repay its loans.
   An A rating _ the third-highest in the Standard &amp; Poor's rankings
_ is given to debt that ``has a strong capacity to pay interest and
repay principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to the
adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions
than debt in higher rated categories.''
   The highest Standard &amp; Poor rating is AAA.
   A rating of BB is fifth on the Standard &amp; Poor's list, and is the
highest of five grades assigned to debt on which there is
speculation about the issuer's ability to pay interest and repay
principal. It is followed by B.
   ``While such debt will likely have some quality and protective
characteristics, these are outweighed by large uncertainties or
major risk exposures to adverse conditions,'' Standard &amp; Poor's said.

<HEAD>Unemployment at 15-Year Low; Market Falls over Inflation Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unemployment dropped to a 15-year low of 5.1
percent in February as employers created 289,000 jobs, the
government said Friday in a report cited as evidence of surprising,
sustained vigor in the economy.
   Wall Street seemed to regard the growth as too vigorous, as stock
prices fell on the Labor Department's announcement. Analysts cited
concerns the Federal Reserve Board may raise interest rates to cool
down the economy as employers bid up wage rates in an
ever-tightening labor market.
   A record 62.9 percent of the working-age population was at work
last month, matching the high set in January, the department said in
data calculated from its monthly household survey.
   The jobless rate, stuck at 5.3 percent or 5.4 percent for five
months, fell 0.3 percentage point in February to 5.1 percent, its
lowest since May 1974. The last time the rate was lower was in
December 1973, when it hit 4.9 percent.
   The gain of 289,000 nonfarm jobs in February reflected improved
conditions in service-producing industries, such as health care and
retail trade, according to a separate survey of business payrolls.
   February's job gains, although strong, were off from January's
huge increase of 415,000 jobs. Last month's harsh weather cut 22,000
jobs from construction employment. Manufacturing jobs were down
8,000 after rising steadily since September.
   Those decreases were more than made up for by a gain of 321,000
jobs in the service sector of the economy, including gains in health
and business services and in retail trade.
   Many analysts had been expecting unemployment to be stagnant or
little changed last month, developments Wall Street would have taken
as a sign the economic expansion was slowing down.
   Wall Street is concerned because the economy has shown few signs
of flagging despite a yearlong campaign by the Federal Reserve to
dampen growth and restrain inflation by pushing up interest rates.
   After Friday's report, some analysts expect further credit
tightening.
   ``Any way you look at it, this is more strength than the Fed's
going to tolerate and that means interest rates will be heading
up,'' said economist David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass.
   Daniel T. Van Dyke, senior economist at Bank of America in San
Francisco, commented, ``We're adding jobs much faster than the labor
force is growing. ... The report portends more monetary tightening.''
   Just last month, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal
Reserve, said he had found recent price gains ``disturbing'' and
laid part of the blame on an acceleration in wage increases.
   February's report, however, showed that seasonally adjusted
average hourly earnings were up just 0.1 percent while average
weekly earnings declined 0.2 percent. Both categories had posted
strong gains during January.
   Economist Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm,
saw some underlying signs of economic weakness in the report,
including the drop in manufacturing employment, a shortening of the
average work week and steady overtime hours at factories.
   ``I read this report as saying the economy is slowing down even
though the so-called headline figures give the veneer of strength,''
Evans said.
   That interpretation was disputed by Jerry Jasinowski, chief
economist of the National Association of Manufacturers, who said
manufacturing was strong except for autos.
   ``Virtually all of manufacturing continues to report good orders
and pretty strong production,'' he said. ``All I get is reports
about how strong orders and the economy are overall.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the drop in the
unemployment rate good news.
   ``Jobs are still the best barometer of a sound economy,'' he
said. ``While the numbers are volatile on a monthly basis, the
economy can continue to create jobs and inflation remain in check.''
   Overall, the civilian labor force contracted by 247,000 people
last month to 123.2 million, while 142,000 workers found jobs.
   The commissioner of the labor statistics, Janet L. Norwood, told
Congress that most of last month's jobless decrease was among young
adults and Hispanics, groups whose jobless rates tend to be erratic.
   The jobless rate among whites was 4.3 percent, down from 4.6
percent in January, while for blacks it was 11.9 percent, down from
12 percent.
   The jobless rate for Hispanics plunged to 6.8 percent from 8.4
percent in January.
   The rate for teen-agers dropped by 1.6 percentage points to 14.8
percent, while the unemployment rate for young adults aged 20 to 24
fell 1.2 points to 8.1 percent.

   The stock market lost ground today, faced with
news of continuing strong growth in employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 19.11 points to
2,272.32 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 522 up, 902 down and
489 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate
fell to 5.1 percent, a 15-year low, in February from 5.4 percent the
month before.
   The report also showed an increase of 289,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, topping most advance estimates.
   Wall Street had been anxiously awaiting the report all week,
hoping for new evidence that economic growth was slowing, taking
upward pressure off inflation and interest rates.
   So the figures were poorly received in both the bond and stock
markets. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, fell about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 1\ at 117}; General Electric, down } at 44}; General
Motors, down 1 at 84{, and American Express, down | at 30.
   Upjohn dropped ] to 29 after losing 2\ points Thursday.

to gauge the effect of new prescription procedures in New York State
on sales of two Upjohn tranquilizers.

1.04 to 164.32. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.00 at 328.36.

   Soybean futures prices closed sharply lower Friday
on the Chicago Board of Trade after whipsawing late in the session
on reports of a nuclear mishap in West Germany and a volcano in
Guatemala.
   ``Ooh, boy, it was wild,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Grain futures finished mixed.
   The markets started out mixed, then rallied at midday following
wire-service reports of a nuclear reactor breakdown in Wiesbaden,
West Germany.
   Traders, recalling the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident,
frantically bought futures contracts on fears of European crop
contamination. But the buyers quickly became sellers on follow-up
reports that no radiation had leaked from the reactor.
   Two out of four emergency cooling systems at the Biblis nuclear
power plant problems temporarily broke down, the Hesse state
government said.
   Selling accelerated shortly thereafter on reports of a volcano
eruption in Guatemala. Lespinasse said a private meteorologist had
said last week that a volcano eruption would reduce the likelihood
of a U.S. drought this summer because an increased number of
particles in the air could encourage rainfall.
   The Pacayo Volcano spewed lava, ash and sand on Friday,
destroying coffee plantations in the path of the molten rock,
seismologists said. They said the eruption was not dangerous.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill designed to reinforce the powers of the
French Stock Exchange watchdog agency has received the green light
from government cabinet ministers and will be brought before the
National Assembly in the spring.
   Coming in the wake of a series of stock market insider trading
scandals and controversial takeover battles, the proposed reform
would allow the Commission des Operations Bourse to initiate legal
action in French courts and hand out fines.
   The commission currently has no enforcement powers of its own.
   The bill was approved at the weekly meeting of government
ministers on Wednesday.
   The measure would make takeover operations in France more
transparent, thereby protecting the interests of small shareholders.
   An official government spokesman said the reform would ``make
sure that the stock exchange did not become a jungle where the small
investor is at the mercy of the big operators.''
   In a nationwide television interview last month, President
Francois Mitterrand called for the ``moralization'' of French
financial markets and condemned stock market speculators.
   The proposed legislation would give commission investigators
wider authority to examine suspected market irregularities, and make
it more difficult to launch takeover and partial bids in France.
   However, it falls short of calls from political and financial
circles for the commission to be given the broad powers enjoyed by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Under the proposed legislation, commission investigators would be
able to carry out searches for incriminating material, but only
under the supervision of a judge and in the company of police
officers.
   The commission also would be empowered to block company bank
accounts, confiscate assets and temporarily suspend company activies.
   The finance ministry said the reform would require an investor or
a group of investors acting together to make a full bid for a
company once it controlled more than one-third of the shares or
voting rights of that company.
   The change would prevent investors from building up excessively
large stakes in companies without making a bid for full control.
   The executive council of the commission also would be increased
from five to eight members, four of whom will be chosed by top state
institututions. Two members would be selected by stock market and
futures market authorities. The last member would be a stock market
professional. The commission president would be named by the cabinet
for a six-year, nonrenewable term.
   In recent months, France has been rocked by a series of insider
trading scandals and takeover battles that have forced the
resignation of a top finance ministery official and implicated a
close associate of Mitterrand.
   The need for the reforms were recently highlighted by the
Pechiney SA insider trading scandal. In November, the U.S. SEC
uncovered evidence of insider trading by French investors who
profited from the acquisition by the French nationalized aluminum
group of American National Can and the other packaging properties of
U.S.-based Triangle Industries Inc.
   After judicial investigation, five of these French investors were
chargd with insider trading offenses, including Roger-Patrice Pelat,
70, a close friend of the Mitterrand's.
   Pelat died of a heart attack Tuesday at the American Hospital of
Paris.

<HEAD>MITI Head Denies Agreement With U.S. On Chip Market Share</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan has never agreed to bring the share of U.S.
semiconductors sold in the Japanese market up to 20 percent by 1991,
the minister of Japan's powerful MITI said Friday in the first
cabinet-level statement on the issue.
   Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, head of the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry, also denied that Japanese companies were involved in
the construction of a chemical weapons plant in Libya.
   On the semiconductor issue, the minister was responding to a
recent statement by U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills that Japan
secretly agreed to increase the share of U.S. chips to 20 percent
when it signed a bilateral semiconductor accord in 1986.
   While issuing the first official denial by a cabinet minister,
Mitsuzuka added, however, that there is no change in the Japanese
government intention of making efforts to increase the share of U.S.
semiconductors in Japan.
   Saying the Japanese chip market is open, he told reporters that
it is possible to bring the share of U.S. chips up to the U.S.
target if the two countries cooperate.
   Mitsuzuka's denial of the involvement of Japanese companies in
the construction of the Libyan chemical weapons plant came one day
after Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. said in a statement, issued
under the name of its president, Yotaro Iida, that it played no part
in the Libyan project.
   In a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing earlier this
month, U.S. intelligence sources were reported to have said
Mitsubishi helped ship machinery which was part of the equipment to
manufacture chemical weapons. Such other Japanese companies as
Toshiba Corp., Mitsubishi Corp. and Japan Steel Works Ltd. were also
allegedly involved.
   Mitsuzuka said MITI itself has investigated the allegations but
found that there is no truth to them. ``There is no problem right
now,'' he said.
   There is speculation in Japan that the charges might be designed
to pressure the U.S. administration to put a stop to a General
Dynamics Corp. move to provide Mitsubishi Heavy Industries with the
technology needed to build a jetfighter modeled after a U.S. plane.

<HEAD>Gannett Chairman: Discussed Possibility of Merger with Time in 1985</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top officials of Gannett Co. Inc. and Time Inc.
discussed the possibility of a merger in 1985 but disagreed on
whether the company should be run with co-chief executives, Gannett
Chairman Allen Neuharth said Friday.
   Neuharth made his remarks in a column published in Gannett's USA
Today newspaper, commenting on Time's agreement to merge with Warner
Communications Inc. The deal calls for co-chief executives to run
the company initially.
   The Gannett chairman wrote that he and J. Richard Munro, Time's
chief executive, ``were of one mind on the merits of a merger of
Gannett and Time.''
   ``But we had two very diverse views about creating a two-headed
monster,'' Neuharth wrote.
   He said after he and Munro had several discusssions, Munro sent
Sol Linowitz, a former Time director, to ``try to sell me on the
co-CEO idea.''
   ``I didn't buy it, because I knew it wouldn't work. I'd had
experience before in 50-50 partnerships, large and small. Nothing
happens,'' Neuharth said.
   Neuharth said Munro also had ``preached that philosophy'' about
co-CEOs to Thomas Wyman, who was chief executive of CBS Inc. in
1985. He did not say what Wyman's reaction was. Wyman was forced out
by the CBS board in November 1986.
   In their merger agreement, Time and Warner said the new company
to be called Time Warner Inc. initially would be headed by co-chief
executives _ Munro from Time and Steven J. Ross from Warner.
   But the longer-term plan is for N.J. Nicholas, Time's president,
to succeed Munro as co-chief executive in two years and eventually
become sole chief executive.
   Time spokesman Louis Slovinsky said Friday his company had no
comment on Neuharth's assertions and that Munro was unavailable. A
call was placed to a spokesman for CBS but it was not immediately
returned.
   A Gannett spokeswoman said she had nothing to add and that
Neuharth was unavailable.
   There were published reports in the summer of 1985 that Gannett
had made advances to both CBS and Time, although a Gannett spokesman
at the time refused to confirm or deny them.
   Time, a leading book and magazine publisher with interests in
cable programming and cable TV systems, announced last Saturday that
it had agreed to a merger with Warner, the film and record giant.
   Time Warner would have an estimated $10 billion in revenue,
making it the world's largest communications concern.

   In early 1986 Eastern's former CEO Frank Borman said the company
had to be ``fixed, sold or tanked.'' With the IAM at that time in
1986 refusing to join all other employees in the effort to fix the
company, by agreeing like all other employees did to 20 percent pay
cuts at that time, Eastern only narrowly avoided extinction by Texas
Air's purchase of it.
   Later that year I joined Eastern and we put forward a six-point
plan to ``fix'' Eastern, if you will, to turn it around and only one
of those points involved changes in labor costs.
   The other points involved making Eastern an on-time airline for
the first time in its history, for expanding its consumer
reservations' reach into travel agencies and we were clearly
successful in both of those objectives.
   But the labor problem obviously took front stage. And one of the
reasons for that is a federal agency called the National Mediation
Board, that literally threw all pretense of neutrality to the wind,
kept Eastern locked up in a fruitless, destructive mediation process
for 17 months while our losses grew alarmingly.
   Meanwhile, some of our critics, some of the union leaders engaged
in what can only be described as a vicious, vicious attack on the
company and its management. An organized litigation and
disinformation campaign to smear the reputation of Texas Air, of
Eastern and its management _ particularly Frank Lorenzo _ and to
thwart our very efforts to provide working capital for the company
through some liquidity programs.
   You know, if you step back, the last several weeks have really
seen the real issues at Eastern Airlines in my view unfortunately
pushed to the background of the public debate. Instead, some have
framed the issues in large global terms, almost defying rational
boundaries.
   They have tried to paint Frank Lorenzo _ who happens to be, by
the way, the longest sitting CEO in the airline business today with
16 continuous years in that role _ as some kind of corporate
villain, ignoring the fact that his efforts over the last 26 years
in this business have created more aviation jobs than any other
individual.
   Texas International in the early 1970's had 2,500 employees, and
up until last week, 60,000 employees were under the Texas Air
umbrella, for those many years of building, not destroying.
   There has not been an honest debate of the issues that face
Eastern Airlines. For example, the company's offer to the IAM to
guarantee all jobs for five years, all jobs for five years, to pay
unskilled workers in a retraining program, full pay while they get
retrained to learn how to be technicians and mechanics so they could
earn twice what they're earning under the training program. That
hasn't been debated.
   While trying to make this appear to be some kind of a national
labor struggle between good and evil, no one is even seriously
debating the fact that the pilots' union leadership decision to
cripple the company defies rationality.
   Consider that their members average nearly $100,000 a year in
wages and benefits, and the company proposed no reductions in base
pay. We proposed job guarantees for five years, guarantees that
there would be no sale of additional aircraft at Eastern Airlines.
That there would be protection on their pay in the event the company
was not successful and had to seek reorganization under the
bankruptcy laws.
   This proposal from a company that in the last 10 years has lost
one billion, five hundred million dollars, and that last year lost
$460 million.
   The pilot union decision to ground Eastern's planes has been
described, I think accurately, as professional suicide. It almost
defies explanation, even in the context of a hard fought labor
battle.
   ALPA's leaders and financial adviser, however, have said publicly
for some time that they are prepared for bankruptcy, and, in fact,
welcome, actually welcome a bankruptcy process so that they could
achieve their stated goal of seeking control of the airline.
   The pilot's union action has forced the bankruptcy filing they
say they are prepared for. But however prepared the financial
adviser and the coterie of lawyers may be, and the pilot union
leaders whose salaries will continue, how ever prepared they are for
bankruptcy, I wonder, I wonder, how prepared the Eastern pilots and
their families are for that process. How prepared can those whose
livelihood and standards of living and family security depend on
flying Eastern's 200 plus airplanes, most of which sit idle today?
How prepared can they be?
   When the giddiness and emotional solidarity wears off and the
picket line is no longer the self-deluded battle between good and
evil, how will the real issues be resolved?
   As a management not only with a personal stake in the outcome,
and I'm not ashamed to say, a strong emotional attachment to this
company, but also with clear fiduciary obligations to the
constituencies of the corporation including our investors, including
our creditors, we tried mightily to keep Eastern from bankruptcy.
But we also feel very strongly that we will be able to protect those
interests of the creditors and those interests of investors and
shareholders in the process that we have been driven to.
   We expect and intend that all creditors will be fully safe, that
investors will realize a value and a fair return, and that a
restructured and revitalized, although somewhat smaller Eastern
Airlines will be flying and will be serving the traveling public for
many years to come. And most importantly, to me at least, is
providing many more jobs to the Eastern professional men and women
who have had the cloud of failure hanging over their heads for many
years and who have brought the airline in recent months to the
number one position in on-time performance. And I think they'll be
able to do it again.

   The stock market pulled back today, faced with
news of continuing strong growth in employment.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate
fell to 5.1 percent, a 15-year low, in February from 5.4 percent the
month before.
   The report also showed an increase of 289,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, topping most advance estimates.
   Wall Street had been anxiously awaiting the report all week,
hoping for new evidence that economic growth was slowing, taking
upward pressure off inflation and interest rates.
   So the figures were poorly received in both the bond and stock
markets. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, fell more than $5 for each
$1,000 in face value.

<TEXT>
   Warwick, R.I., job counselor Robert MacDonald
knew about Eastern Airlines' labor problems when he booked a flight
to Dothan, Ala., on the carrier two months ago, but he couldn't
resist the low ticket price.
   Now he's paying for it _ several hundred dollars to be precise.
   When Eastern filed for federal bankruptcy law protection this
past week in the midst of a crippling strike, MacDonald had to find
a last-minute, costlier flight on another airline.
   He's one of the luckier ones.
   Many more Eastern ticketholders have been grounded, forced to
cancel travel plans because a number of other booked carriers aren't
honoring their tickets and they can't afford to make other
arrangements, travel agents said Friday.
   Worse, a few others that flew one way before the Eastern strike
began a week ago have been stranded, the agents said. Some booked on
package deals linked with Eastern have faced other problems, they
said.
   One man who surprised his wife for their anniversary by whisking
her away for a five-day stay in Florida found a Key West hotel
wouldn't honor the room voucher that came as part of the Eastern
package, said Maija Groden, manager of Church Travel in Warwick, R.I.
   ``Fortunately he was able to stay at the condo of a friend
there,'' Groden said.
   In Miami, Eastern ticketholder Mary Jennings complained to a
local television station, ``We don't know if we're going to be
life-time Floridians, or if we get to go back home.''
   Jennings had a cruise deal that included roundtrip tickets on
Eastern to the busy Port of Miami.
   ``Eastern has told us that our tickets are nonrefundable. On our
cruise line we learned later that Continental (Airlines) would honor
them, but they can't even guarantee that,'' Jennings said.
   ``It's all very confusing right now,'' said Marsha Thompson, a
travel agent with DMS Travel in New York. ``Nobody's quite sure what
to do.''
   She said her company, like other travel firms, had been steering
clients away from Eastern when its labor problems intensified
several weeks ago. But a few that already booked Eastern flights are
now forced to change their plans.
   Thompson said one woman, who had planned to fly on Eastern as
part of a $2,000 eight-day Florida cruise package, will have to pay
about $500 more for roundtrip tickets on another airline or scrap
her plans.
   ``It was a Disney-beach-cruise deal. Her daughter will be real
disappointed if they don't go,'' Thompson said.
   Many cruise lines, however, have arranged for flights on other
airlines for passengers booked on package deals linked to Eastern at
no extra cost, said Tim Gallagher, a spokesman for Carnival Cruise
Lines in Miami.
   ``It hasn't been easy, but we're getting them all protected,'' he
said.
   Miami-based Eastern _ the nation's seventh-largest airline with
1,000 flights a day before the strike _ said $200 million worth of
tickets were in the hands of passengers and other airlines when it
filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Act on Thursday.
   In the eyes of the bankruptcy court, ticketholders are unsecured
creditors, trailing secured creditors in priority. That means it may
be some time before they can get refunds, if ever.
   Those who paid for tickets on a major credit card, however, may
have an easier time, since a federal law protects consumers who make
credit-card purchases but fail to receive goods or services.
   Eastern has promised to get as many planes airborne as possible
as it reorganizes under bankruptcy protection and make good on old
tickets.
   Nonetheless, travel agents said they're not optimistic.
   ``We haven't been selling Eastern wholeheartedly in the last
eight months ... I don't know if we will ever again,'' said Jack
Bloch, owner of JB's World Travel in New York.
   Others say it may take some time for strike-burdened passengers
to forgive and forget.
   Among those are MacDonald, owner of an employee-assistance
company in Rhode Island, who in January bought a restricted $280.50
Eastern roundtrip ticket to Dothan, Ala., as a gift for his
daughter, Nancy. He had to shell out $320.50 more for tickets on
another airline after the strike.
   ``I now have another set of tickets lost in limbo,'' MacDonald
said, although he admits he was partly to blame. ``I bought these
tickets even though they were talking about a strike because they
were the cheapest around.''

   The energy futures market turned mixed in choppy
trading Friday, with prices of wholesale home heating oil and
gasoline rising and crude oil falling.
   The April contract for heating oil gained 0.81 cent to settle at
51.19 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exhange, after
declining 0.99 cent on Thursday.
   April unleaded gasoline, which fell 0.25 cent Thursday, closed up
0.18 cent on the exchange to 51.78 cents a gallon.
   The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, closed at $18.50 a barrel, down 2 cents.
The contract had fallen 2 cents in the previous session.
   Most of Friday's activity was focused on gasoline, market
observers said.
   William Byers, an energy analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said
prices had risen in anticipation of an Environmental Protection
Agency report on summer gasoline standards.
   He said the report, released after the market closed, proposed
changes in gasoline chemical composition that may push up refining
costs, and, ultimately gas prices.

   The dollar wound up the week on a strong note
Friday, finishing higher against most major currencies amid buying
inspired by the government's report of a decline in unemployment.
   Gold prices slipped in domestic dealings after rising overseas.
At 4 p.m. EST, Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of
$393.50 for a troy ounce of gold, 30 cents lower than Thursday's
late bid.
   As currency trading got under way in the United States, the Labor
Department reported the February unemployment rate fell to a 15-year
low of 5.1 percent from 5.4 percent in January. Payroll growth was
strong, with 289,000 new non-farm jobs created during the month, the
report from Washington said.
   Foreign exchange dealers interprepted the figures as evidence of
robust economic activity. The view touched off a rally in the
dollar, which pushed the U.S. currency to 1.8660 West German marks
in London trading.
   ``The reaction to the unemployment report was logical,'' said
Jesse Torres, Bank of Boston's chief dealer in New York.
   Stephen Leach, a currency analyst at Chemical Bank, said
broad-based dollar buying steadily continued for much of the session
until close to the end.
   He said the rally ran out of steam as activity slackened toward
the end of New York's session, which normally happens ahead of a
weekend. The loss in the rally's momentum also occurred because
dealers decided to collect profits.
   There were unconfirmed rumors that the Federal Reserve Board had
intervened, selling dollars to slow the advance. But dealers said
there was no proof that the central bank had come into the market.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.35 yen to a closing 128.88 yen.
   The dollar headed higher as trading centers opened in other
cities around the globe. In London, it was quoted at 129.46 yen, and
late in New York's business day it was quoted at 129.40, up from
128.80 on Thursday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7159 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7183 late Thursday. By the
time dealing was done for the day in New York, sterling fetched
$1.7177 compared to Thursday's $1.7220.
   Other later dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates, included: 1.86175 West German marks, up from 1.85625;
1.58975 Swiss francs, up from 1.58555; 1.1987 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.19925; 6.314 French francs, up from 6.2975; and 1,366.75
Italian lire, up from 1,363.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
levels included: 1.8629 West German marks, up from 1.8600; 1.5918
Swiss francs, up from 1.5895; 6.3185 French francs, up from 6.3125;
2.1020 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1000; 1,366.00 Italian lire,
unchanged; and, 1.1987 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2000.
   Gold prices finished mixed and silver prices rose.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $394.30 a troy ounce, down from $395.10 Thursday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $393.25 a troy ounce,
compared with $391.55 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold rose to close at a bid $393.50 from $391.75 bid
late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.58 to close at a bid $396.08.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6 a troy ounce, compared with
Thursday's $5.88. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery settled at $6.068 a troy ounce, up from Thursday's
settlement of $6.008.

<HEAD>Volcano, Nuclear Mishap Called Factors In Soybean Futures Plunge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices were whipsawed Friday amid reports of a
nuclear mishap in West Germany, then plunged to a sharply lower
close as news of a volcanic eruption in Guatemala eased fears of
another drought-ridden U.S. growing season.
   ``Ooh, boy, it was wild,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Grain futures finished mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade. On
other markets, silver futures gained while gold retreated; livestock
and meat futures advanced; and energy futures were mixed.
   Soybean futures settled 5 cents to 11 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $7.57 a bushel. Wheat was \ cent
to 3{ cents higher with March at $4.36 a bushel; corn was } cent to
2\ cents lower with March at $2.75{ a bushel; oats were { cent lower
to } cent higher with March at $2.07 a bushel.
   Soybeans rallied at midday following wire-service reports of a
nuclear reactor breakdown near Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Traders, recalling the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident,
frantically bought futures contracts on fears of European crop
contamination. At one point in the session, the most active soybean
contract, for May delivery, was up more than 12 cents from
Thursday's close.
   But buyers turned sellers on follow-up reports that no radiation
had leaked from the reactor. Two out of four emergency cooling
systems at the Biblis nuclear power plant problems temporarily broke
down, the Hesse state government said.
   Selling accelerated shortly thereafter on news of a volcano
eruption in Guatemala. The Pacayo volcano, which last erupted in
June 1987, was reported to be spewing lava, ash and sand, forcing
the evacuation of 255 people.
   Analysts said the market's reaction was partly based on a finding
published four years ago by Paul Handler, a University of Illinois
physics professor, that volcanic eruptions near the equator
typically are followed by good growing weather in the United States.
   Handler had spoken on the subject last week at a crop-weather
symposium in Chicago. He said in a telephone conversation Friday
that it was too soon to tell whether the eruption in Guatemala might
have some impact on this summer's weather.
   Handler said volcanic eruptions can send certain gases into the
stratosphere, where they oxidize into sulfuric acid and water, then
condense into a sunlight-reflecting fog that can stay there for a
year or longer.
   ``One hundred and twenty years of data show that when you have a
low-latitude volcanic eruption, you have good growing weather in the
U.S. corn belt,'' Handler said.
   Silver futures built strongly on Thursday's gains on the New
York's Commodity Exchange, pushing the price for spot delivery well
above the psychologically important $6-a-troy-ounce level breached
in the previous session.
   Analysts said Friday's national unemployment report, showing a
0.3 percentage point drop in unemployment last month, ignited new
inflation fears and brought more dollars into the silver market as a
hedge against rising prices.
   But gold futures retreated, displaying once again the reluctance
to rally that is turning some investors against gold as an inflation
hedge.
   Gold settled 20 cents to 90 cents lower with April at $396.50 a
troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 7.4 cents higher with May at $6.15
an ounce and the spot March contract at $6.068 an ounce.
   Strong cash markets boosted live cattle futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, which spurred buying in the adjacent pits.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent to 1 cent higher with April at 78.05
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent lower to .38 cent higher
with March at 81.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent lower to
.40 cent higher with April at 43.65 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .08 cent lower to .60 cent higher with March at 38.45
cents a pound.
   In choppy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas
Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents lower to 1 cent higher with
April at $18.50 a barrel; heating oil was .61 cent to .81 cent lower
with April at 51.19 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .18 cent
to .45 cent higher with April at 51.78 cents a pound.

   Goverment bond prices tumbled Friday in response
to news of strong employment growth in February.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond skidded } point, or about
$7.50 per $1,000 in face amount, while its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from its price, jumped to 9.14 percent from 9.06
percent late Thursday.
   A new Labor Department report said the nation's unemployment rate
in February fell to 5.1 percent, the lowest point in 15 years, as
employers created 289,000 new jobs. The report also boosted the
estimate of January job growth to 415,000 from 408,000 previously
reported.
   The growth in non-farm payrolls suggested efforts to slow
economic activity to reduce upward pressures on prices have not had
much effect.
   Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., said the report indicated ``new job creation hasn't been
slowed at all.''
   ``It has gotten some people nervous about what the Fed might do
next,'' he said.
   The Federal Reserve has taken steps in recent weeks to encourage
higher interest rates in a bid to slow the economy and reduce
inflationary pressures. Bond prices deteriorate when interest rates
go up, but bond values are also eroded by inflation.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term governments were off by between \ point and ] point,
intermediate maturities lost { point and long-term issues fell as
much as ~ point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, dropped 5.31 to 1,118.83.
   Corporate bonds moved modestly lower. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate
bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.80 to 298.12.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3-16 point to 9019-32. The average yield
to maturity rose to 7.72 percent from 7.70 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 9.05 percent as the
discount rose 8 basis points to 8.74 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 9.30 percent as the discount rose 14 basis points to
8.78 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.54 percent as the
discount rose 12 basis points to 8.79 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 9} percent, down from 913-16 percent late
Thursday.

   Striking Eastern Airlines Machinists said Friday
they would file their own plan to rescue the carrier from bankruptcy
and they denounced management for threatening to split the union by
replacing unskilled members.
   Bolstered by crucial support on the picket lines they've received
from Eastern's pilots, the Machinists said they'll continue striking
together in the face of what they call the company's
``divide-and-conquer'' strategy.
   ``We went out on strike together, we'll go back together,'' Roy
Anderson, a Machinists general chairman in Miami, said Friday. ``The
idea of a union is everyone's together.''
   He insisted that Eastern's petition for protection from creditors
under the bankruptcy laws, filed Thursday in a New York court,
hasn't daunted the Machinists' spirit.
   ``There is no incentive for people to go back,'' Anderson said.
   The Machinist strategists said they plan to fight in bankruptcy
court any company attempts to split the union.
   They said they'll also seek an emergency court order against
sales of Eastern assets, notably the plan to sell its profitable
Northeast shuttle service to developer Donald Trump.
   In addition, they said they'll try to bring Eastern's parent
Texas Air Corp. and sister carrier Continental Airlines into the
bankruptcy proceedings; and to change the court location of the
proceedings from New York to Miami.
   The Machinists plan to present an alternative reorganization plan
to the court that calls for the sale of Eastern intact to an outside
party, according to sources close to the union.
   The union is seeking such a sale ``so we've got a live asset to
move,'' said a source, who requested anonymity.
   Financier Carl Icahn, chairman of Eastern rival Trans World
Airlines, publicly expressed interest several months ago in
acquiring Eastern. Icahn reportedly has been asked in recent days by
Eastern union representatives to consider a buyout.
   The Chapter 11 filing would still allow a takeover but would
force approval by the bankruptcy court as well as by Eastern unions
and creditors.
   When Eastern officials announced the filing Thursday, they
addressed the two factions within the Machinists union separately.
The 8,500 members of the International Association of Machinists at
Eastern are divided into two categories: aircraft mechanics and ramp
service workers.
   The mechanics, the more skilled of the two groups, earn a top
wage of $18.83 an hour at Eastern. The less skilled ramp workers,
who fuel planes, handle baggage and drive motorized equipment on
airport runways, make top pay of $15.60 an hour.
   If Eastern's pilots could be induced to return to work, ``much of
the (ground) work will be contracted out,'' Eastern President Phil
Bakes told a news conference. ``If our mechanics come back to work,
they will get paid.
   ``The Machinists chose to leave their jobs. The majority of the
Machinists union are not mechanics. The majority are cleaners,
baggage handlers, stock clerks, janitors.''
   Eastern has arranged for those types of work to be done ``with
outside vendors, some that are serving other airlines,'' Bakes said.
   Bakes apparently was holding out a carrot to the skilled
mechanics, which Eastern needs almost as much as the pilots, and a
stick to the ramp workers, who could be replaced relatively easily.
   That approach might not get a warm reception from the bankruptcy
judge, a legal expert suggested.
   ``What (a judge) would be looking to do is to bring the parties
together,'' said William Ury, associate director of the program on
negotiation at Harvard Law School.
   The Machinists could be successful in court in blocking efforts
to split the union, he said.

   News of continuing strong growth in employment
sent stock prices lower in relatively quiet trading Friday
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.29 to 2,282.14,
reducing its gain for the week to 7.85 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
612 up, 838 down and 507 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 146.83 million
shares, against 143.36 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 174.08 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate
fell to 5.1 percent, a 15-year low, in February from 5.4 percent the
month before.
   The report also showed an increase of 289,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, topping most advance estimates.
   Wall Street had been anxiously awaiting the report all week,
hoping for new evidence that economic growth was slowing, taking
upward pressure off inflation and interest rates.
   So the figures were poorly received in both the bond and stock
markets. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, fell more than $5 for each
$1,000 in face value.
   However, most of the selling hit the stock market early in the
day, when the Dow Jones industrials' loss approached 20 points.
   Brokers said the market's partial recovery in late trading was
encouraged by a feeling that the latest data might not prompt any
immediate further credit-tightening moves from the Federal Reserve.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down ] at 118\; General Electric, down { at 45; General
Motors, down } at 84}, and American Express, down | at 30.
   Upjohn dropped [ to 29\ in active trading after losing 2\ points
Thursday. Responding to an analyst's report, the company said it was
too soon to gauge the effect of new prescription procedures in New
York State on sales of two Upjohn tranquilizers.
   Warner Communications climbed 1~ to 49 and Time Inc. rose 3{ to
115}. There was conjecture on Wall Street that either or both
companies might have opened themselves up as prospective takeover
targets with their announcement last weekend of plans to merge.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $8.79 billion, or 0.30
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .51 to 164.85.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.26 to 338.17, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down 1.05 at 292.88.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
.23 to 405.90. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 328.92, down .44.

<HEAD>Gonzalez: Tax Increase For Thrift Crisis Would Save $138 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raising taxes to solve the savings and loan
crisis could save taxpayers $138 billion over the next 30 years, a
congressman critical of federal regulators' handling of the crisis
said Friday.
   Congress and Americans were misinformed about the costs of saving
the troubled thrift industry, said U.S. Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, who
also suggested top thrift regulators step aside after he heard that
the deficit of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. had
quadrupled from $14 billion in 1987 to at least $56 billion in 1988.
   Gonzalez, a Democrat from San Antonio who is chairman of the
House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, is conducting a
two-day field hearing on the S&amp;L crisis.
   Gonzalez was highly critical of M. Danny Wall, chairman of the
Home Loan Bank Board, which administers the FSLIC.
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
said the agency's figure for the 1988 FSLIC deficit is closer to $45
billion and complained that the General Accounting Office ``arrived
at their number without the benefit of having talked to us.''
   Hoyle said Wall has testified before the House Banking Committee
that the size of the S&amp;L problem was $75 billion to $80 billion. He
said that could not be directly compared with the FSLIC deficit.
   ``Clearly Mr. Gonzalez is mixing up apples and oranges,'' Hoyle
said.
   Frederick Wolf, assistant comptroller general of the General
Accounting Office, fueled the criticism of Wall after telling the
committee the Southwest Plan to bail out insolvent thrifts was too
costly.
   ``The deals were terribly expensive and we think there could have
been more ways you could have done it less costly,'' Wolf told the
committee.
   ``We are still in the process of doing the audit, so the numbers
may be higher than lower,'' he said about the FSLIC deficit.
   Wolf said solving the crisis would cost at least $140 billion _
$60 billion for the deals already made, $50 billion for the current
insolvents and another $30 billion for the future insolvencies.
   He also said the cost would not have been as great if the
government had taken steps to solve the problem three years ago.
   ``Even using accounting numbers we believe you could have known
that the problem was bigger than what (Wall) was saying. We've had
other hearings where we've both been there and we've disagreed about
the numbers,'' Wolf told reporters after his testimony.
   Gonzalez, meanwhile, suggested that raising taxes, instead of
borrowing, could save taxpayers' money even if it meant not
complying with the Gramm-Rudmann budget balancing law.
   ``I don't see why we should pay $138 billion, just to make Gramm
look good,'' he said.
   Gonzalez said Wall as late as January had not told the committee
about the FSLIC's deficit.
   ``These statistics refute the testimony we've had,'' Gonzalez
said. ``I just feel under these circumstances the Congress and the
American public was so disgracefully misinformed.
   ``The persons responsible should step aside at this time,'' he
said while criticizing Wall.
   ``There is something wrong somewhere. How can we allow a
quasi-independent agency to in effect authorize and appropriate
without going through those regular procedures that even the
president can't do. The president wouldn't be able on his own do
what Danny Wall did last December,'' Gonzalez said.
   Wolf, meanwhile, said that he would not be surprised if half the
tax dollars spent on solving the S&amp;L crisis were spent in Texas.
   So far this year, 118 savings and loan institutions have been
taken over by federal regulators, including 36 in Texas.

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Telecom USA has agreed to acquire Western
Union Corp.'s private line and switched long-distance voice
business, the companies announced Friday.
   The services, which have been provided by Western Union's Network
Services unit, produced revenue of about $72 million in 1988,
according to a written statement jointly issued by the companies.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   The acquisition is structured as a cash purchase of customer
accounts and is contingent upon regulatory approvals, the companies
said.
   ``Acquisition will continue to be an important aspect of Telecom
USA's growth strategy,'' said Telecom USA Chairman O. Gene Gabbard.
``It is our goal to increase our revenue by 25 percent through
internal marketing efforts and an additional 25 percent through the
Western Union transaction and other acquisitions.''
   Telecom USA advertises itself as the nation's fourth largest
long-distance carrier and is the holding company for regional
long-distance carriers Southern-Net USA and Teleconnect USA. It owns
and operates an all-digital fiber optic network with 14 digital
switching centers and provides national service through its
membership in the National Telecommunications Network.
   Western Union, based in Upper Saddle River, provides messaging
and financial services, both national and internationally.
   The company underwent a major restructuring late in 1987 because
of financial problems that pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy. The
reorganization included the merger of Western Union and its Western
Union Telegraph Co. subsidiary, the purchase of ITT Corp.'s
international telex service an exchange of its debt for stock in the
restructured company.
   Western Union last week reported a $244 million loss in
fourth-quarter 1988 earnings, which it attributed to restructuring
charges.

<HEAD>Christian Group Calls for One-Year Pepsi Boycott Due to Madonna Ties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

   A Christian organization called Friday for a
boycott of Pepsi because the soft drink maker refused to cancel its
contract with the singer Madonna, who also is starring in a steamy
music video set in a church.
   The American Family Association, based in Tupelo, Miss., said it
was asking people not to drink Pepsi for a year because Pepsi
rejected its request to cancel a contract with Madonna for her
appearance in a Pepsi commercial.
   ``It is indeed unfortunate that Pepsi would give Madonna millions
of dollars for the right to promote her as a role model for our
youth,'' said Donmald E. Wildmon, executive director of the
association.
   The group publishes a monthly Christian magazine that claims a
circulation of 380,000. Pepsi has not said how much it is paying the
singer although published reports have estimated it at between $2
million and $5 million.
   Asked if the boycott was simply an attempt at censorship, Wildmon
said, ``Pepsi doesn't have to withdraw the commercial. Just don't
ask me to pay my money to help pay for Madonna's contract.''
   At Pepsi-Cola Co. headquarters in Somers, N.Y., spokeswoman Becky
Madeira said, ``It is regrettable that he is taking this action
because it is difficult to definitively make a value judgment.''
   She said Pepsi officials had talked to Wildmon and hoped to set
up a meeting at which it could ``discuss his concerns at greater
length.''
   The company has previously said its commercial with Madonna was
entirely separate from the singer's music video. Both the commercial
and the video feature her new song, ``Like a Prayer.''
   Pepsi bought time on the top-rated shows in 40 countries on March
2 to launch its new two-minute commercial called ``Make a Wish,''
which featured the first public broadcast of ``Like a Prayer.''
   The commercial showed Madonna watching a home film of her eighth
birthday, and then trading places with the young girl who played her
as a child.
   On March 3, Madonna's music video debuted on the MTV cable
network.
   It tells a story of a woman who goes to the rescue of a man
wrongly accused of attacking another woman. The video shows Madonna
seeking refuge in a church, dancing among burning crosses, kissing a
statue that come to life, freeing an accused man and then kissing
him.
   Wildmon said his group interpreted the character Madonna plays in
the video to be symbolic of Jesus Christ while the man she rescues
symbolizes a priest.
   ``But the video's symbolism of Christ having sex with a priest,
suggesting the priests _ indeed all Christians _ are sexually
repressed is blatantly offensive. That is absolutely repugnant to
Christians,'' he said.
   Pepsi pulled its Madonna ad from MTV after the cable network
began running the video, although a source close to Pepsi said it
was so the commercial would not compete with the video rather
because of than reservations about the video.
   Pepsi officials said they still plan to sponsor a worldwide
concert tour by Madonna and to run shorter versions of the
two-minute Pepsi ad with the singer on broadcast television.

<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has agreed to ban
financier Michael Milken from ever working at the firm and forbid
other workers from talking business with him even if he's acquitted
of expected criminal charges, sources said Friday.
   Sources familiar with the firm's plea-bargain settlement talks,
who spoke on condition they not be identified, said the same
restrictions apply to Milken's brother Lowell, a senior Drexel aide
who is expected to be indicted as well.
   Securities and Exchange Commission negotiatiors imposed the
restrictions in talks with Drexel aimed at resolving wide-ranging
civil fraud charges against the firm, the sources said.
   Terms of the settlement represent much tighter restrictions on
Drexel and the Milken brothers than earlier disclosed in its
bargaining to end an intense federal fraud investigation that has
dogged the firm for more than two years. A draft of the settlement,
which SEC commissioners are expected to vote on next week, also
compels Drexel to submit to the oversight of two panels that will
scrutinize its finances and interrogate employees about possible
wrongdoing, the sources said.
   Further, the sources said, the SEC will require the firm to put
on leave any Drexel employee named in future enforcement actions by
the watchdog agency.
   In exchange, the SEC has dropped an earlier insistence that
Drexel relocate its lucrative high-yield bond division from Beverly
Hills, Calif., to the firm's New York headquarters, the sources
said. Drexel had argued that such a move would devastate its
business in the $175 billion high-yield bond market.
   A Drexel-SEC settlement is a crucial precondition for finalizing
a criminal plea bargain with the Justice Department, which the firm
agreed to in December to avoid a crippling racketeering and fraud
indictment.
   In negotiations with federal prosecutors, Drexel previously had
agreed to fire the Milkens and withhold most of their 1988
compensation. Lawyers for the brothers have challenged that
agreement in court.
   ``The SEC agreement takes it a step further,'' said one source.
``It implicitly says you can't hire the guy after you fire him, and
it says you can't talk to the guy.''
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said in a statement: ``Both sides
to the settlement discussions have worked diligently and
conscientiously for months now toward an agreement and we are not
going to comment on it. When the details are final they will be made
public and then the facts will be available.''
   Chiles Larson, a spokesman for the SEC in Washington, declined to
comment in accordance with agency policy on pending cases.
   Officials at Robinson Lake Lerer &amp; Montgomery, a public relations
firm hired by Michael Milken to speak on his behalf, declined to
comment. Eugene Licker, an attorney for Lowell Milken, also declined
to comment.
   Michael Milken is considered one of the most dynamic financiers
of the decade and is largely credited with vaulting Drexel to the
forefront of the lucrative market in high-yield debt securities,
known as junk bonds. He created Drexel's Beverly Hills-based bond
trading division about 10 years ago.
   He also has been a leading target of a federal campaign against
trading abuses spawned by a Wall Street corruption scandal that led
to the exposure of frauds by Ivan F. Boesky, a well-known speculator
now in prison.
   Boesky has been the main source of evidence against Drexel and
the Milken brothers, accusing them of crimes that range from insider
trading to stock manipulation to cheating Drexel clients.
   Drexel asserted innocence until Dec. 21, when it capitulated to
federal pressure and agreed to a plea bargain in order to avoid
potentially devastating racketeering charges, which carry enormous
fines and penalties.
   The Milkens have denied all wrongdoing and have yet to be charged
with any crime. But they are widely expected to be indicted soon on
federal fraud and racketeering charges.
   Drexel's chief executive Frederick Joseph admitted in court
papers filed earlier this week that the firm agreed to fire the
Milkens and deny them most of their 1988 compensation at the
insistence of federal prosecutors.
   In an indication of other settlement-related management changes
at Drexel, the firm on Friday announced the appointment of a new
vice chairman and three appointments in the corporate finance
department.
   Joseph said in a statement that the moves ``importantly position
Drexel to capitalize on the opportunities we see ahead.''

<TEXT>
   Channel One, the new service that is beaming
daily news shows with commercials into six schools, said Friday it
plans to produce its first live broadcast on Monday with coverage of
the space shuttle launch.
   The special broadcast, which will contain no commercials, will be
sent to the six schools participating in the test of the new service
for use at their discretion, the programs creators said.
   Channel One is a service of Whittle Communications LP, a
Knoxville, Tenn.-based media concern that has given about $50,000 in
televisions, video equipment and satellite dishes to each of the six
test schools to receive its daily 12-minute news show. Each show
contains up to two minutes of paid ads.
   Some educators have denounced the project, which debuted Monday,
for permitting advertisers to intrude into the classrooms.
   The space launch coverage will be separate from the daily news
show. It will feature live video supplied by NASA via satellite
along with commentary from the Los Angeles studio by the regular
Channel One news anchors and a space travel expert.
   The Discovery launch is tentatively scheduled for Monday morning.
   William S. Rukeyser, editor-in-chief of Whittle Communications,
said the plans for a live broadcast provide ``an exciting example of
what Channel One can do.''
   The six schools involved in the test are Eisenhower Middle School
in Kansas City, Kan.; Withrow High School in Cincinnati; Mumford
High School in Detroit; Central High School in Knoxville, Tenn.;
Billerica Memorial High School near Boston and Gahr High School in
Cerritos, Calif.

   The investor group seeking to buy Emhart Corp.
offered Friday to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the
consumer and industrial products manufacturer, but Emhart dismissed
the offer as unacceptable.
   Topper L.P. said in a statement it was willing to enter into an
agreement under which Emhart would give the investor group access to
confidential financial information about the company. Topper has
offered to buy Emhart for $35 a share or a total of $2.4 billion.
   However, the statement made no mention of a standstill agreement,
which Emhart has insisted Topper sign before it can see the
information. Under a standstill agreement, investors say they will
not acquire any further stock in a target company except through a
tender offer.
   Emhart, which has rejected the Topper bid as inadequate, said the
investor group ``has not indicated to Emhart that it is willing to
sign a confidentiality and standstill agreement in a form
acceptable'' to the manufacturer.
   Therefore, Emhart said, it was not agreeing to supply information
to Topper.
   Emhart says it has supplied information to other parties
interested in buying the company. It has not identified any other
bidders.
   Topper's investors include oil heir Gordon P. Getty and New York
developers Lawrence and Zachary Fisher.

<TEXT>
   A telephone company that charges to provide
unlisted numbers now wants to sell another service that gives
customers a peek at the number of the person calling before they
pick up the phone.
   The ``Caller ID'' service, already used in New Jersey and
proposed in several other states, is drawing static from consumer
and civil rights advocates who say it would invade privacy and break
anti-wiretap laws.
   The state Public Utility Commission must approve the Bell of
Pennsylvania proposal before it takes effect. The company, a
subsidiary of Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp., had hoped to
initiate the service by March 19 but on Friday postponed the date to
April 9 to give itself time to respond to the concerns, said PUC
spokesman John Frazier in Harrisburg.
   Caller ID would enable customers to view on a display device the
telephone number of the caller's phone, even if that number is
unlisted. The device would cost about $70 and the service $6.50
monthly.
   Bell of Pennsylvania says the service would enhance the privacy
of the person being called, enabling him or her to screen incoming
calls and pinpoint their origin.
   ``It's much like a peephole in a door in your home. It allows you
to see who's at your door,'' company spokesman Miles Kotay said.
   The company has invested about $20 million in Philadelphia alone
to upgrade its equipment to handle a range of services including
Caller ID. Kotay said the company expects revenues ``in the tens of
millions of dollars'' from the services within five years.
   But state Consumer Advocate David Barasch warned the service
could be devastating, for example, to someone staying in a shelter
for battered women who needs to contact her husband but would not
want him to know the shelter's number.
   ``Once somebody has your number, it doesn't take a lot of effort
to find out where you are,'' Barasch said.
   Barry Steinhardt, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union in Pennsylvania, argues the service would be illegal.
   Steinhardt filed a complaint Friday with the Public Utility
Commission contending the state Wiretapping and Electronic
Surveillance Act strictly limits the use of ``trap and trace
devices'' that identify the number of a phone on which a call is
being placed.
   ``Bell's customers would all be committing a third-degree felony
if they ordered this,'' Steinhardt said.
   Kotay disputed the question of illegality, saying the company had
concluded after a ``very careful examination of the laws'' that
Caller ID would be legal. He declined further comment pending action
on Steinhardt's complaint.
   Bob Frazier, a prosecutor in the Public Utility Commission's
Office of Trial Staff in Harrisburg, said his staff filed a request
Friday for formal hearings on the effect of the services on Bell of
Pennsylvania's rates.
   With annual revenues of about $2 billion and more than 3.8
million customers, the company could benefit or lose substantially
from the new services, Bob Frazier said.
   The filing could result in the postponement of the service for
several months, he said.
   The introduction of such service is likely to be proposed around
the country as companies upgrade their switching and signaling
equipment to handle the sophisticated information it requires.
   Bell Atlantic subsidiary New Jersey Bell began offering Caller ID
late last year after a six-month trial period in two areas of the
state serving 213,000 residential customers and 85,000 business
customers, said George Dawson, a spokesman for the New Jersey Board
of Public Utilities.
   Fears that the service would be used by businesses to obtain
numbers for telephone solicitations did not pan out, he said.
Overall, the service drew positive support, he said.
   Since the introduction statewide, the Board of Public Utilities
had received about 50 complaints, mostly from people with unlisted
numbers, Dawson said. The rate of complaints had dropped to about
two or three a month since the first weeks of the service, he said.
   New Jersey Bell hopes to make the service available to 72 percent
of the state by the end of this year and will update the board on
any complaints every six months, Dawson said.
   Nynex Corp., the regional phone company that owns New York
Telephone and New England Telephone, is studying a similar service
but expects to conduct extensive trials and air privacy concerns,
said spokesman Bob O'Brien.
   He added that the technology required for such service is not in
place throughout Nynex's network and would cost hundreds of millions
of dollars.
   Southern Bell, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp.,
included Caller ID in a three-year trial program in Orlando, Fla.,
starting in 1984, said Southern Bell spokesman Bob Morrow.
   The company, which serves North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia
and Florida, will probably propose the service to regulatory
agencies later this year, he said.
   ``My feeling is that Caller ID is a very valuable and a very good
option,'' Morrow said, adding it could help computerized companies
serve customers more quickly.
   Concerns about people learning unlisted numbers can be addressed
by the caller, he said. ``As the originator, you can control the
number on that display,'' he said. ``You can go to a pay telephone
or to a friend's house to place a call.''
   One option being considered by Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of the
San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Corp., would allow callers to
prevent their number from being displayed.
   But Bell Atlantic's companies contend such a blocking feature
would defeat the purpose of the service.

   Lawyers for Eastern Airlines Machinists said
Friday they will mount a legal battle to get wages owed to striking
union members and repeated accusations that the crippled carrier
timed its bankruptcy filing to make sure workers went unpaid.
   Machinists who expected to be paid Thursday instead had their
final pre-strike paychecks withheld by Eastern as part of its
petition for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code.
   All of Eastern's expenditures and business transactions now must
be approved by the bankruptcy court.
   Robert Clayman, a Washington-based attorney for the Machinists,
said he would file papers soon in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan
to ``correct the pay situation ``and make sure these employees get
paid as quickly as possible.''
   Sources estimate the 8,500 Machinists are owed about $7.5 million
for the week.
   The Machinists are particularly irked because a federal judge
overseeing the bankruptcy has signed orders allowing Eastern to
compensate other employees who have continued working instead of
joining the strike.
   Federal Judge Burton R. Lifland on Thursday authorized the
carrier to pay its employees working outside the United States _ in
Central and South America and the Caribbean _ provide benefits and
salary and reimburse expenses for other currently working Eastern
employees.
   Eastern's timing of its Bankruptcy Court petition ``really
rankled the people,'' Clayman said.
   ``It seems not coincidental that the timing of the bankruptcy was
intended to deny these employees the wages for the work they
performed,'' he said. Clayman said he will stress that issue when he
files court documents.
   A number of union officials voiced similar complaints on
Thursday, after Eastern made its filing.
   Attorneys for Eastern, however, were upbeat about the court
action. Eastern attorney Bruce Zirinsky said the signing of the
orders represented ``a fair amount of movement'' in what is certain
to be a lengthly court proceeding.
   While no further hearings have been scheduled, Zirinsky said a
meeting would be held within the next two weeks to organize an
official creditors committee. The panel ultimately will have a say
in Eastern's reorganization plan for emerging from Chapter 11.
   Zirinisky also said Eastern's creditors ``already are beginning
to communicate with us as well as the company and with each other.''
He said creditors were requesting information on the affects of the
bankruptcy filing and ``are indicating that they are interested in
assisting Eastern.''
   Nearly 20 attorneys are working on the case for Eastern and its
parent, Texas Air Corp. ``Things are moving very smoothly,''
Zirinsky said.
   Meanwhile, spokesman David Jimenez, a spokesman for Seattle-based
Boeing Co., said the company is not worried about the $54 million it
is owed by Eastern. ``We're confident we're going to be paid,'' he
said.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo and other Eastern executives
have vowed all creditors will be paid and shareholders will receive
``fair value.''
   At the Bank of New York, trustee for about $150 million unsecured
bonds held by nearly 4,000 bondholders, spokesman Owen Brady said
the bank was ``consulting with its counsel to determine what actions
would be appropriate for us to take in terms of our responsibilities
to the bondholders.''
   Trustees often are either invited or seek to serve on creditors
committees in order to represent the interests of the bondholders.

   Two shareholders of BankAmerica Corp. have sued
company officers over a student-loan fiasco that could cost a group
of banks $450 million to $650 million, their law firm announced
Friday.
   BankAmerica announced Wednesday it was boosting its first-quarter
reserves to cover its part in losses that resulted from an unusually
high default rate on student vocational loans for which it acted as
trustee.
   The holding company for San Francisco-based Bank of America said
the addition to its reserves would not have a material effect on its
1989 earnings.
   Greenfield &amp; Chimicles, a Haverford, Pa.-based law firm, said it
was representing two shareholders in the suit, filed in the Court of
Chancery in Wilmington, Del.
   A news release from the law firm did not name the shareholder
plaintiffs or say what they were seeking. Richard D. Greenfield, the
lead attorney, did not return a phone call late Friday seeking
clarification.
   The student loan problems came to the surface when the Department
of Education decided to withdraw a federal guarantee on the loans,
triggering the prospect that the huge defaults would be borne by
banks that backed the loans with letters of credit.
   The letters of credit were issued by Citicorp and several
Japanese institutions, including Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.

<HEAD>Jury Awards ETSI $345 Million in Slurry Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEAUMONT, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury Friday ordered Santa Fe
Southern Pacific Corp. and one of its units to pay $345 million to a
pipeline joint venture after ruling earlier that they conspired to
delay the venture's construction of a coal slurry pipeline.
   The amount will be tripled automatically to $1.035 billion if the
judge upholds the jury's award and issues it as a final judgment.
Santa Fe is expected to appeal.
   The planned 1,800-mile, underground coal slurry pipeline would
have extended from Wyoming to Texas and Oklahoma and was abandoned
in July 1984 after a series of delays the pipeline venture alleged
were caused by a group of railroads.
   The pipeline venture, known as Energy Transportation Systems
Inc., filed a 1984 suit against Burlington Northern Railroad Co.,
Union Pacific Railroad Co., Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., Kansas
City Southern Railway Co., and Chicago and North Western
Transportation Co. Santa Fe was added to the suit a few months later.
   All the railroads except Santa Fe had settled out of court for
$285 million.
   The members of the pipeline venture were Texas Eastern Corp.;
Bechtel Petroleum Inc., a subsidiary of the construction giant;
InterNorth Inc., now Houston-based Enron Corp.; and K-N Energy Co.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Parker had given the jury a directed
verdict determining that Santa Fe Southern Pacific and its Santa Fe
Railway Co. unit had participated in an illegal conspiracy.
   After deducting the total of $285 million already paid by the
other defendants, the net amount of the recovery against the Santa
Fe will be $750 million, assuming the jury's award is tripled, Texas
Eastern spokesman Fred Wichlep said.
   ``SFSP and Santa Fe Railway continue to believe that they did not
cause the failure of the proposed ETSA coal slurry pipeline and that
the award of damages is not justified,'' a statement by Santa Fe
said. ``The company believes there are significant issues on which
to base post-trial motions to set aside the verdict. The company
also believes there are significant issues on which to base an
appeal and intends to appeal the verdict.''
   Lawyers for the pipeline contended the project, if completed,
would have had a net cash flow of about $11 billion over 35 years.
   The railroads were accused of delaying the project by using
complex legal procedures before federal and state regulatory
agencies, organizing farm and environmental groups in opposition and
not granting rights-of-way through railroad property.
   ETSI attorneys said the delays occurred during a period of high
inflation and increased the cost of the project from $689 million in
1974 to $3.5 billion in 1984.
   Judge Parker ruled Monday that there was ``an agreement or
conspiracy to delay, hinder or stop'' the project and Santa Fe
knowingly took part in the agreement.
   Santa Fe attorney Fred Furth argued the pipeline project was a
sham and Bechtel profited from the project by taking money for the
engineering but would not take the risks needed to get the project
off the drawing board.
   He also contended that project was destined to fail without the
railroads because companies could not secure customers, financing
and a ruling on whether the pipeline fell under Interstate Commerce
Commission regulations.

   Eastern Airlines filed for protection from
creditors in bankruptcy court Thursday, the sixth day of a
Machinists strike, blaming pilots for a ``cash crisis'' that
paralyzed the nation's seventh-largest airline.
   The move came a day after Eastern insisted such a step remained a
last resort in the airline's effort to endure the strike, which had
strong support from pilots and flight attendants and was costing
Eastern an estimated $4 million a day.
   Eastern, filing under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here,
listed more than $4.5 billion in net assets, $3.39 billion in
liabilities and 15,696 creditors. The filing is designed to give
Eastern a reprieve from debts while it tries to restructure and
extricate itself from the worst crisis in its 60-year history.
   Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo blamed ``the damage that has been
caused by the pilots union.'' He and Eastern President Phil Bakes
insisted they intend to restore the airline in bankruptcy court,
though in a smaller form.
   ``We tried mightily to keep Eastern from bankruptcy,'' Bakes said
at a news conference. ``We intend to operate our airline: make no
mistake about that.''
   Bakes said Eastern faces a ``cash crisis that can only be averted
and stabilized by'' turning to the bankruptcy court.
   Union leaders denounced Lorenzo as a ``robber baron.'' Machinists
called for a public boycott of Eastern's sister airline,
Continental, set up pickets against Continental in Houston, and said
they would oppose Eastern's reorganization plan and any sale of
assets.
   Lorenzo and Bakes pledged that all creditors would be paid in
full; shareholders would receive ``fair value''; passengers would be
protected, and as many employees as possible would return to work.
Eastern had 31,200 employees before the strike.
   John Peterpaul, a Machinists vice president, said Eastern filed
for bankruptcy on payday ``in a spiteful attempt to deny Eastern
workers their last paycheck earned before the strike.'' Paychecks
were frozen by the move.
   Eastern encouraged its ticket-holders to redeem their tickets
with other carriers, and failing that, to mail them in for refunds.
Continental said it would accept Eastern tickets at full value.
   As of Thursday, Other carriers such as Braniff and TWA refused to
honor Eastern tickets, while some carriers accepted them, subject to
such ``significant restrictions'' as stand-by seats only for
full-price tickets.
   John Bavis, head of the Eastern pilots union, said management
continued calling pilots at home in hopes some will return to work.
He said the effort would fail.
   Henry Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, said
he hoped the move meant Lorenzo is ``finished'' at Eastern.
   The company, which has a staggering $2.5 billion in debt, has
admitted it was taken by surprise when most of the 3,600 Eastern
pilots honored Machinists' picket lines, forcing Miami-based Eastern
to shut down nearly all operations Monday and lay off 9,500
non-union employees.
   Eastern, running just 4 percent of its flights with a crew of
1,500, is losing $4 million a day, Bakes said. Before the 8,500
Machinists struck Saturday in a dispute over concessions, losses
were pegged at $1 million daily.
   Union leaders long have said they believe Lorenzo wants to break
them and tear Eastern apart. But Lorenzo would have a tougher time
imposing lower wages at Eastern than he did when he reorganized
Continental in 1983. Congress amended bankruptcy law in 1984 to
require bankrupt companies to negotiate with unions and prove
economic necessity before abrogating contracts.
   Lorenzo stressed the filing covered only Eastern and not its
parent Texas Air Corp., of which he is chairman. But on Thursday,
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, filed a bill to allow Eastern
creditors to collect from the parent company.
   ``This bill would prevent Frank Lorenzo and any other airline
buccaneers from using bankruptcy to escape their creditors and
destroy their workers,'' Metzenbaum said.
   ``Make no mistake about it. Continental is on strike now,''
Eastern Machinists leader Charles E. Bryan said as his members
cheered. ``There's never been a more classic example of a robber
baron. ... Anytime anyone buys a ticket on Continental, they're
making a contribution to treachery ... to atrocity ... to evil.''
   At a news conference in New York, Lorenzo noted the animosity
union leaders have expressed toward him and said it had ``hurt my
family and me.''
   ``But I suggest that the intensive focus on a single person does
a real gross injustice to the real issues that are at stake in
airline deregulation and, indeed, in our business climate today,''
he said.
   Bakes and Lorenzo avoided specific comment on the news that
Lorenzo rival Carl Icahn had been asked by Eastern strikers to
consider a buyout of Eastern.
   The Chapter 11 filing would not prevent such a takeover but would
force approval by the bankruptcy court as well as creditors, making
such a transaction cumbersome. Unions would also have a say.
   Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines, said Wednesday he would
consider requests to acquire Eastern only if Eastern allowed the
negotiations.
   The Machinists helped Icahn snatch TWA in 1985 despite Lorenzo's
competing bid. Icahn mulled a bid for Eastern last fall, but talks
faltered when he asked for up to $300 million in concessions from
its union in exchange for a stake in the company.
   Bakes said Eastern's immediate focus will be on the few
operations it has retained _ its Northeast shuttle service, and
flights to South America.
   As pilots become available, Eastern plans to ``prudently but
unmistakably'' put more planes into the air, Bakes added.
   Bankruptcy court must approve any ticket refunds to passengers.
The court considers ticket holders as unsecured creditors who must
wait in line behind secured creditors, who receive higher preference.
   Among other developments:
   _ The Machinists said in Washington that the union, along with
the pilots union and the Transport Workers Union, which represents
flight attendants, would draft a reorganization plan to submit to
bankruptcy court next week. No details were given.
   _ Bakes said the court action would not affect a pending $365
million sale of the Northeast shuttle to New York developer Donald
Trump.
   _ In New York, a federal judge heard arguments but withheld
ruling on whether to extend a ban against commuter rail sympathy
strikes, which could disrupt travel for more than 320,000 people in
the New York area. A federal appeals court in Philadelphia refused
to overturn a ban on sympathy strikes at commuter railroads there.
   _ In Washington, the House Public Works Committee approved
legislation aimed at pushing President Bush into the strike by
forcing appointment of an emergency board. The legislation goes to
the House, where passage is likely. But the Bush administration has
threatened to veto it, and it may not even make it out of the Senate.
