<HEAD>Moslem Guerrillas Attack Army Post, Wounding 3; Red Cross Mulling
Return</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas fired more than a dozen
grenades into an army observation post in south Lebanon on Monday,
wounding three soldiers, police said.
   Also Monday, the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red
Cross said it sent four officials to Lebanon to determine whether
the organization should resume operations.
   Police said the guerrillas fired at least 15 rocket-propelled
grenades at the hilltop position overlooking the Christian towns of
Jezzine and Roum, 11 miles east of Sidon.
   An army spokesman said the pre-dawn attack was the first by
Moslem guerrillas on a Lebanese military position in the south, the
region used by Palestinians and Moslem fighters for assaults on
Israel's buffer strip.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the attackers belonged to the Islamic Coalition, a
small Sunni Moslem group based in Sidon, provincial capital of south
Lebanon.
   The group is allied with the Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Fundamentalists have claimed the army post was manned by troops
sympathetic to the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army, a mainly
Christian militia that patrols the security zone with the Israelis.
   Moslem guerrillas frequently clash with the South Lebanon Army in
their campaign to drive the Israelis out of the border buffer zone.
   All the soldiers wounded Monday were Christian, the police
spokesman said.
   He said the army post was destroyed in the attack. But the army
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it resumed
communications shortly after the assault.
   In Geneva, a spokesman of the International Committee of the Red
Cross said four officials of the group traveled to Beirut on Sunday
to gather information for a decision on whether to resume operations.
   The all-Swiss organization pulled out of Lebanon a month ago
after workers there received death threats. Four days before the
suspension, kidnappers had released the ICRC's chief delegate in
southern Lebanon, Peter Winkler, who had been held hostage for more
than a month.
   The group behind the kidnapping and the death threats has never
been clearly identified.

   It's been called the Midwest's Silicon Valley. A
region known for rustic woods and clear waters is also a breeding
ground for the ultimate high-tech machine: the supercomputer. The
growing supercomputer industry in Wisconsin and Minnesota is the
subject of the second story in a four-part series, ``The Changing
Heartland,'' that explores the new economic order in the Midwest.

   This land of sparkling waters and
towering trees was once home to brawny loggers who shaped a town's
past. Now it's a mecca for some of America's brainiest scientists,
plotting a path to the future.
   This is ``America's Dairyland,'' proclaimed on every Wisconsin
license plate. But cow country is swiftly developing into a
supercomputer corridor, where some of the fastest, costliest and
most mind-boggling machines in the world are created.
   With $50 million in incentives as a sweetener, this ex-lumber
mill town lured a different breed of builder: supercomputer wizard
Steve Chen, whose young company hopes to construct a new machine 100
times faster than any that exists. Target completion date: the early
1990s.
   ``Every state in the nation wanted this,'' said Michael Schatz,
Eau Claire's economic development specialist. ``It definitely is a
major coup. ... This has just as much impact as an auto plant would
have for Kentucky or Tennessee.''
   Chen's firm hasn't created many jobs yet and there's not even a
guaranteed product, but his locating here in 1987 further
establishes the upper Midwest as the nation's supercomputer capital.
   The region was already home to Cray Research Inc. and founder
Seymour Cray, the guru of supercomputers, as well as the industry's
second major U.S. player _ ETA Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Control
Data Corp.
   Now joining them is Chen's Supercomputer Systems Inc. They are
all within 100 miles of each other in northwestern Wisconsin and
southeastern Minnesota.
   They have followed a path laid down just after World War II, when
several retired naval intelligence officers founded Engineering
Research Associates in St. Paul, Minn., and built code-cracking
computers for the government. ERA was later bought out by UNIVAC,
which years later spawned Control Data.
   Cray helped start Control Data, then formed his own company in
1972.
   Cray Research, headquartered in Minneapolis, has a major base 11
miles from here, in Chippewa Falls. Cray recently expanded to
Colorado, but most of his workers are in the two Midwestern states.
   Cray hired Chen, who left to start his own firm 16 months ago.
Now these neighbor rivals are competing to create a machine faster
than those that already do billions of calculations a second and
help design cars, forecast weather and aid in weapons research.
   ``They're both after the fastest gun in the West,'' said Peter
Patton, a computer consultant in Minnesota. ``Chen's oiling up his
holster.''
   Having so much brainpower battling to build the world's biggest
and best supercomputer in so small a region lends new prominence to
a part of America probably better known for breweries and bitter
cold than breakthroughs.
   ``This places Minnesota and Wisconsin on the international map,''
said Patton, director of technology assessment at the Super
Performance Computing Service of Dataquest Inc., a
marketing-forecasting firm.
   ``It adds prestige. It's sort of the difference between a
Chevrolet assembly plant in your area and a Rolls Royce (plant),''
he said. ``They don't think of us as dairy and flour milling states
any more.''
   Some predict this industry will have a ripple effect, attracting
parts and supply businesses. Patton said hundreds of companies in
the Twin Cities area, such as Honeywell and 3M, are already involved
in advanced technology.
   Some have grander visions. ``The potential is here to develop
these businesses and offshoots into a mini-Silicon Valley,'' said
Dick Hansen, president of the First Wisconsin National Bank of Eau
Claire.
   But there are big differences between Silicon Valley and Chippewa
Valley.
   In California, the focus is on microprocessors _ materials for
many everyday products.
   Supercomputers are more elite, with only about 350 installed
worldwide, many in government and corporate offices, and expensive,
costing $10-25 million each, Patton said.
   ``In terms of dollars this is a very small corner of the total
computer market,'' said Tad Pinkerton, director of information
technology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ``Even if you
have 100 machines at $10 milion apiece, that's not a lot of money.''
   Some Midwesterners also say they don't care to duplicate some
things about the Silicon Valley, particularly its explosive growth.
   ``Wisconsin has a very progressive social environment, one which
is going to move cautiously in things like building,'' Pinkerton
said.
   Even Chen's company will grow slowly. Chen, who formed a
partnership with International Business Machines Corp., talks of
taking four to five years to build his computer. Employment, now
about 100, isn't expected to reach 1,000 until the late 1990s.
   Despite the wait, Eau Claire, population 58,000, had few qualms
about offering Chen a $50 million package of grants and federally
guaranteed loans, even though it was $4 million more than the city's
annual budget.
   The city is lending $1.5 million of the $31.2 million loan
package. Hansen's bank is responsible for the rest. The deal calls
for a federal agency to guarantee $25 million in loans, which
haven't been approved yet.
   Despite the risks, Schatz said, ``This was the chance of a
lifetime. It's the first time we seriously played with the big boys
and went after a nationally known famous person.''
   Eau Claire and other cities began wooing Chen when he left Cray
in September 1987 after the company canceled his supercomputer
project, saying his proposal was too risky and too costly.
   He decided on Eau Claire, in part to avoid moving the 40 Cray
workers he'd attracted to his company. Chen has also opened a
Chinese restaurant in town.
   His company has created an influx of new residents who Schatz
said are responsible for raising the average cost of a house to
$105,000, up $20,000 from 1987.
   ``You're always looking for clean, high-tech industry,'' Schatz
added. ``They pay high wages. It brings an intellect to your
community with scientists and engineers. It's an environment people
like to work in.''
   That wasn't always the image of this northwestern Wisconsin town,
named for its clear waters. In the 19th century, Eau Claire was
white-pine country, home to logger barons. With 20 sawmills on its
river banks, it was nicknamed ``Sawdust City.''
   A century later, in 1981, an almanac ranked Eau Claire No. 1 in
America for most taverns per person _ one for every 629 people.
   Schatz said being home to one of a handful of supercomputer
companies in the world will give Eau Claire new visibility. ``People
around the nation,'' he said, ``will know who we are now.''

   They're super-swift high-tech superstars that can do anything
from design nuclear warheads to build a better yacht.
   Supercomputers are used by the government, the military,
universities and Fortune 500 companies to help crack codes, forecast
weather, design aircraft, conduct geological exploration or simulate
the effects of nuclear explosions.
   ``The supercomputer is important economically and socially,''
said Peter Patton, a computer consultant in Minnesota. ``They're
used in everything from the mundane to the sublime _ designing
appliances ... to developing new life-saving techniques and
surgery.''
   That range, he said, can help shape America's role in the world
economy.
   ``The whole name of the game is competitive advantage in the
international market,'' said Patton, director of technology
assessment at the Super Performance Computing Service of Dataquest
Inc., a marketing-forecasting firm. ``The key to maintaining that
competitive advantage is faster design, reduced government
certification time, better testing.''
   The two major U.S. supercomputer companies are Cray Research Inc.
and ETA Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Control Data Corp.
   Its competition: three Japanese computer giants _ Fujitsu,
Hitachi and NEC.
   There also are about three dozen smaller, so-called
``mini-supercomputer'' companies in the United States, Patton said.
   Some experts believe the Japanese are threatening America's
dominance of the industry. ``We opened a very large lead and we no
longer have that large lead,'' Patton said.
   One of Japan's main advantages, he said, is it has the ``lion's
share of semiconductor (computer chips) market. We gave up on the
semiconductor industry.''
   But other experts say it's too early to talk of the Japanese
overtaking the United States.
   ``Even though Cray machines use a lot of Japanese components, I
don't think it's fair to say they're ahead in any way, shape or
form,'' said Michael Burwen, president of Palo Alto Management
Group, a consulting firm.
   ``There are a lot of people who say the Japanese are a very big
threat to supercomputers,'' he said. ``I don't think the evidence is
in. The Japanese certainly have not been able to demonstrate they
can penetrate anything outside their home market in this business.''
   About 350 supercomputers have been installed worldwide. U.S.
customers include NASA, the National Cancer Institute and Los Alamos
National Laboratory, location of the first Cray, introduced in 1976.
   Supercomputers can do billions of calculations a second.
   For example, a Bible concordance _ an alphabetical referencing by
word _ that took a scholar 17 years to do in the mid-1700s and
required 1,000 hours on a computer in 1956 can be done on a Cray
supercomputer in 20 seconds, Patton said.
   Although experts sometimes disagree on what a supercomputer is,
it generally is described as the fastest, largest, most expensive
machine at any time _ one that can do problems others can't.
   Burwen also said 44 percent of all supercomputers are in private
industry, 37 percent in government installations, and 19 percent in
universities.
   Nowadays, supercomputers are changing industry, because products
``can not only be designed and prototyped on screen, but be tested
and evaluated ... and have complete data performance before you
touch tool to steel,'' he said.
   Automakers, for one, ``can do a design in six months instead of
18 months,'' he said. ``You can literally take years off the design
cycle.''
   Supercomputers have also begun to simulate crash testing for
autos.
   And oil companies use supercomputers to get the best production
in petroleum exploration.
   ``If they get 1 percent (more oil) out of a reservoir, it pays
for itself 100 times over,'' Patton said. ``What if it's a $10
million computer if you get $20 billion (more oil) out of a
reservoir?''
   Among Cray's customers are America's Big Three automakers,
Volkswagen, Fiat and petroleum giants such as Shell and Chevron.
   A Cray supercomputer also was used to help design Stars &amp;
Stripes, the yacht Dennis Conner sailed in 1987 when he won the
America's Cup. Two competing syndicates also used Cray technology,
said company spokesman John Swenson.
   Scientists designing supercomputers are toiling in an industry
constantly trying to produce faster machines.
   Cray plans to have a new supercomputer ready this year or next,
and it's expected to be 100 times faster than his original machine.
In 1992-94, he hopes to produce the Cray-4, 1,000 times more
powerful.
   And, Swenson said, that won't be the end. As he explained, ``We
still don't see the limit.''

   The French writer Andre Lautreamont once
described surrealism as the chance encounter of an umbrella and
typewriter on an operating table. Salvador Dali defined the
philosophical and artistic movement through his work and through his
life, which eventually became a surreal canvas.
   From his dreams and from impulses that seeped from the dark side
of the soul, Dali expressed his rage against the social order and
impishly tweaked the bourgeoisie.
   His death Monday in his hometown of Figueras, Spain, at the age
of 84, ended a life filled with eccentricities and a creative streak
that touched the art world like a live grenade. Though few of the
original surrealists _ who exchanged their revolutionary ideas in
Paris cafes in the late 1920s _ are still alive, many in the world
of art were quick to recognize his loss and his gift.
   There was, and will always be, only one Dali _ a man with
intense, saucer eyes and a mustache that traveled upward to form a
bullseye with his cheeks.
   ``More than any of his contemporaries, Dali painted through the
mind's eye,'' pop artist Peter Max said Monday. ``By expanding the
boundaries of time and space on canvas, he changed the relationship
between art and reality, influencing every artist who followed him.
Much of the surrealism in my early work grew out of my admiration
for him.''
   Kirk Varnedoe, director of painting and sculpture at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York, called Dali ``a unique figure in modern
art.''
   ``Dali's extraordinary theatrical instincts, and the expansion of
his career into various commercial realms, redefined the conception
of how a modern artist might engage himself with contemporary
society,'' Varnedoe said. ``For those who are concerned with the
intermingling in modern art of the scandalous and the playful, or of
psychological revelation and gadfly irritation, Dali will always be
an exemplary figure.''
   His images of watery timepieces, melting flesh and disfigured
appendages became symbols of irrational expression and insolence for
a group of writers, painters and philosophers who had set out to
explode the social order. They included the artists Yves Tanguy,
Jean Arp, Joan Miro, Magritte and Max Ernst, filmmaker Luis Bunuel,
and the writers Andre Breton and Paul Eluard.
   ``The Happy Horse,'' which Dali painted around 1980, showed a
hideous purple beast. Dali said it didn't matter whether it was a
horse or a cow; the animal was ``rotten.'' And he once created a
plaster lion's head with a fried egg in its mouth.
   Sometime in the 1920s, Dali had a dream about a hand crawling
with ants. He told Bunuel about the dream, who had had his own
encounter with the dark side of his soul: He had dreamed about a
razor-like cloud slicing the moon in half.
   From the two dreams sprang the screenplay for the Bunuel movie
fantasy, ``Un Chien andalou,'' or ``An Andalusian Dog,'' an
irrational series of vignettes which opens with a razor cutting an
eyeball.
   Dali's artistic genius had evolved from more than one plane: He
had journeyed from realism (``Basket of Bread'') to cubism
(``Harlequins'') to neoclassicism (``Venus and Cupid''). And when
his thoughts turned to money instead of transforming life, the
surrealists ``excommunicated'' him.
   During the Spanish Civil War in the late '30s, when surrealism
had surely reached it peak, Dali, who supported the fascists,
developed a new appreciation for the Renaissance and baroque which
began showing in his work (``Impression of Africa,'' ``Philosophy
Illuminated''). With the outbreak of World War II, he became more
classic and he took to painting portraits of women. After the war,
his paintings had more religious themes.
   ``Everything in life leads to one idea,'' Dali said in an
interview with The Associated Press in 1963. ``At first I was
interested in psychoanalysis, then in the Theory of Relativity and
nuclear physics. Now I am obsessed with biology ... molecular
structure ... cybernetics. ... But everything science is connected
by art.
   ``Scientific people believe in God and realize that matter is
only energy. Material things disappear. We live now in a crisis of
mysticism. Everything is metaphysical. We are in a new renaissance
of religion _ and reunification of religions.''
   In 1949, he gave his first religious painting to the Vatican.
   ``Dali disconcerted superficial minds because he hid truths with
light and because he used the dialectic of analogy rather than that
of identity,'' said the artist Georges Mathieu in an interview in
Paris on Monday. ``Dali is more important as a cosmic genius than as
a painter.''
   Still, many recognized his value as an artist. A. Reynolds Morse,
a Cleveland industrialist, began collecting Dali's work in 1955 and
accumulated the largest collection in the world. In 1982, Morse
founded the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla. It contains
93 oils, over 100 watercolors and drawings and over 1,000 graphics
as well as sculptures, documents and photographs.
   ``He is the greatest artist of the 20th century and he was our
friend,'' Morse in a statement on Monday before leaving for Dali's
funeral in Spain.
   Throughout his life, Dali moved in a world of symbols, whether
canes, crutches, watches or animals. At one time he gave art
lectures clad in a diving suit. He also once summed up his personal
philosophy in two words: ``Galadeoxyribonucleic Acid.'' The first
four letters formed the name of his wife, Gala. The rest, he said,
was DNA _ the chemical of which genes are made. To Dali, it was a
symbol of immortality.
   ``All my eccentricities are to prove that I am still alive and
immortal,'' he once said. ``With me, it has to be that _ death or
life.''

   President Bush on Monday called abortion ``our
American tragedy'' as nearly 70,000 protesters marked the
anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark decision legalizing
abortion. The march organizer said the new administration should
``provide actions to carry out their words.''
   Bush, speaking by telephone hook-up to the activists, said the
Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision ``was wrong and should be
overturned.''
   ``I wanted to share with you my deep personal concern about our
American tragedy _ abortion on demand,'' Bush said over
loudspeakers. ``I think America needs a human life amendment and I
think when it comes to abortion, there's a better way _ the way of
adoption, the way of life.''
   The president said he was ``confident that more and more
Americans every year _ every day _ are hearing your message and
taking it to heart. I promise you that the president hears you now
and stands with you in a cause that must be won.''
   The Washington march was the focal point of what was intended to
be a nationwide protest against the 1973 Supreme Court decision.
   In Dallas, Texas, a crowd estimated at 3,000 people rallied at
City Hall and march to a federal courthouse to protest the ruling.
   Meantime, Dr. Louis Sullivan, Bush's choice for Secretary of
Health and Human Services, has been telling members of Congress the
1973 decision shouldn't be overturned, according to the New York
Times.
   The newspaper, in its Tuesday editions, quoted unnamed sources as
saying Sullivan said the decision shouldn't be overturned. Sullivan
causes a furor last month when he said he personally favored
permitting a woman to choose to have an abortion, but he later said
he supported Bush's position.
   The Washington crowd, estimated by U.S. Park Police at 67,300,
assembled at noon in sunny, mild weather on the Ellipse with the
White House as a backdrop. As Bush spoke at the start of the rally,
which came after a weekend of demonstrations around the nation, the
demonstrators cheered his words and waved signs.
   But Nellie Gray of the March for Life, which organized the annual
protest, told the crowd Bush could not hear their applause because
the White House communications office had installed a one-way
communications line. She said she hoped that did not portend the
nature of their future communications.
   ``He spoke to us, but he could not listen to us,'' she said.
``That was not an adequate way to deal with our pro-life movement.''
   Gray said that at a meeting earlier in the day with Dan Quayle,
she and other anti-abortion leaders told the vice president, ``We
will not be talked to, and not (have) him listen to us.''
   She said they told Quayle and other administration officials that
``they need to provide actions to carry out their words.''
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., echoed that call, saying:
   ``Bush has repeatedly made his commitment to the unborn. Now is
the time to produce.''
   Quayle said he assured the group of the administration's support
and told them he has been involved with people from his home state
of Indiana on the issue.
   Asked whether the Bush administration could succeed in getting
the Roe vs. Wade decision reversed, Quayle replied:
   ``Time will tell. We have the same commitment.''
   Abortion opponents are hoping that the Supreme Court, with Reagan
appointee Anthony M. Kennedy on board, may use a case from Missouri
to review the legal doctrines governing abortion and reverse the
decision legalizing abortion. Kennedy's views on abortion are not
known.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Sunday he hopes the court
will use the Missouri case to overturn Roe vs. Wade.
   The noontime rally and march to Capitol Hill have become an
annual affair. Crowds at past commemorations on the Ellipse have
ranged from 5,000 in a heavy snowstorm to 100,000 or more.
   Police reported no violence Monday, but said about 75
anti-abortion protesters were arrested for blocking access to a
Washington doctors' office where abortions are performed.
   After the rally, protesters marched from the Ellipse to Capitol
Hill. Some met with members of Congress, others gathered at the
Supreme Court to chant ``pro-life, pro-life, pro-life.''
   Advocates of the right to abortion attacked Bush's comments and
warned about the consequences of restricting women's rights to
abortion.
   ``Make no mistake about it: President Bush wants to drag American
women back to a time when they risked mutilation, humiliation and
even death in order to take the most basic control of their own
lives,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director of the National
Abortion Rights Action League.
   Douglas Gould of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America
said Bush appeared to be playing down the abortion issue, noting
that the president sent Quayle to meet with the protest leaders
instead of meeting with them himself.
   ``For George Bush to succeed in the future, he has to mute the
controversy over this issue,'' Gould said. ``He is pushing
tolerance.''
   But John C. Willke, president of the National Right to Life
Committee, said he had no problem meeting with the vice president
and said he believes Bush ``will probably walk in Ronald Reagan's
mocassins on this issue.''
   Hours after relinquishing the presidency on Friday, Reagan
mentioned the battle to reverse Roe vs. Wade as one of the
unfinished items of business from his administration.
   Willke also called for a non-sectarian prayer crusade ``to help
stop today's holocaust.'' He gave no details, saying individuals
will have to work out what is comfortable for them.
   ``All we can do is plant a seed and call for it,'' he said. ``But
I see tens of thousands of pastors ... tens of thousands (of) points
of light on a prayer crusade.''
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has estimated that 1.5 million
abortions are performed every year in the United States.

   A car struck a building after a dog sitting
in the front seat bumped the driver out of the vehicle, police said.
   The 8-month-old, mixed-breed shepherd named Ebony was riding
shotgun with owner Joseph Vellone on Sunday when Vellone stopped at
a red light and opened his door to spit, police said.
   The dog pushed the Norwalk resident out, and the car rolled

Vellone giving chase, police said.
   The car, which came to rest against the building, sustained only
minor damage, police said. The building was not damaged. Vellone

   A cook at a branch of a landmark steak
sandwich shop fatally stabbed a customer who had complained about
poor service, authorities said.
   Herbert Saxton, who worked for Pat's King of Steaks in northeast
Philadelphia, was being held without bail on murder and weapons
charges, police said.
   Saxton, 44, was taking orders at a walk-up window early Sunday
when he and Henry Griffith, 24, began quarreling about the service,
according to Detective Sgt. Dennis Murray. About a dozen other
customers were standing at the window.
   Police said Saxton picked up a knife inside the window, reached

   In a country where lovers of birds abound and
sometimes travel all day to glimpse a rare one, the 100th birthday
of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is hardly a ho-hum
affair.
   Witness the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. She took time off
this month to christen a new locomotive The Avocet, after the wading
bird that is the Royal Society's symbol, inaugurating an array of
events centered on the Feb. 17 anniversary.
   Victorian gentlewomen founded the society in 1889 to combat the
trade in bird feathers. It now claims to be Europe's largest
voluntary wildlife conservation group and second in the world only
to the U.S. National Audubon Society.
   A century ago, the slaughter of egrets to provide white plumes
for hats threatened the bird with annihilation.
   ``The trade was eventually stopped, thanks to those women and
their pledge not to wear bird feathers,'' said Chris Harbard,
spokesman for the society. ``Killing birds for plumage is now
totally outlawed in this country.''
   ``It was quite a feat,'' he said, because London was the center
of a $10 million annual fashion trade in the feathers of such birds
as egrets, kingfishers, swallows, owls and birds of paradise from
New Guinea.
   Royal sponsorship was bestowed in 1904. The society now has about
450,000 adult members and 110,000 juniors, employs nearly 500
people, runs 114 nature reserves and handles the equivalent of
nearly $25 million a year in subscriptions, donations and legacies.
   Why so much interest? ``Because you can watch birds wherever you
are, even in the middle of London, and not just pigeons and
sparrows,'' Harbard said. ``You can see kestrels hunting in the City
(financial district) and great crested grebes catching fish on the
River Thames.''
   Grebes, prized for the gingery feathers around their faces, were
down to their last 42 pairs in the early 1900s. Harbard said they
now number about 5,000 pairs because of conservation measures.
   Britain has about 470 of the world's 9,000 bird species. Its
commonest is the blackbird, about 15 million, and the rarest is the
black redstart, of which only 50 pairs remain. The black redstart
likes to breed at nuclear power stations.
   Bird protection in Britain is centuries old but was introduced to
save wildfowl for royal hunters. A 1533 law protected their eggs and
enforced seasonal restrictions on killing the birds.
   Among the society's first campaigns was a protest of trapping
songbirds and of poletraps, which fetter the feet of birds as they
land on posts, leaving them to starve.
   From its headquarters in an old manor house in a woodland at
Sandy, 44 miles north of London, the society now runs such projects
as treaining wardens in Ghana and Nigeria to protect birds that
migrate from Britain in winter.
   It works against the shooting or trapping of migrants like
nightingales, warblers, blackcaps and honey buzzards as they fly
south over France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Cyprus and Malta.
   ``It's an uphill battle,'' Harbard said. ``Conservation is a
concept barely understood in some countries. The bird protection
society in Italy has had its offices bombed.''
   He said the biggest problems are pollution and habitat loss as
land is developed, so the society sometimes buys land to save birds.
   In 1959 it established the Loch Garten Nature Reserve to protect
the first pair of ospreys to breed in Britain for 50 years. More
than a million visitors have watched ospreys through binoculars as
they snatch fish on the Scottish loch and tend their young.
   The white-tailed eagle, extinct in Britain since 1916, was
reintroduced by the society from Norway four years ago.
   Advice from the society on looking after birds includes a
celebrated recipe for ``bird cake'' of nuts, grated cheese, seeds
and household scraps. Combine one pound of the mixture with half a
pound of melted lard or suet, leave it to set, then put it in a
feeder.
   More than 1,000 events are planned for the centenary: bird
watchings, boat trips to remote nesting sites, films, exhibitions,
concerts and children's studies.
   Harbard says the society gets 15,000 calls a year, often to save
birds soaked in oil spills.
   ``We had one from a lady on the south coast who said she had an
oiled bird,'' he said. ``We told her how to clean the oil off and
then asked her what kind of seabird it was.''
   She said it wasn't a seabird. Her parakeet had fallen into the
frying pan.

<HEAD>Investigator: Hahn Said She Had Cocaine Habit</HEAD>

   A state investigator testified Monday that
Jessica Hahn told him she had a cocaine habit around the time she
said she received $12,000 in ``hush money'' from the PTL ministry.
   The former Long Island church secretary said she used $7,000 to
buy cocaine sometime after getting two payments from the PTL
ministry, said Richard Friedman, an investigator for the state
attorney general's office. He said he did not know if the PTL money
went directly for the drugs.
   Friedman testified that Hahn told him that one of her close
friends wrote a letter to the PTL ministry asking for $100,000 not
to talk about an alleged rape by PTL television evangelist Jim
Bakker. News of Bakker's 1980 sexual encounter with Hahn led to his
ouster from his lucrative ministry post.
   ``She described what had happened and to me it sounded like
extortion,'' Friedman said of Hahn's description of the letter,
apparently sent to PTL in 1985.
   Friedman testified Monday in a hearing what evidence should be
admitted for Long Island minister Eugene Profeta's upcoming trial on
tax evasion charges. Profeta also is accused of trying to persuade
Hahn, his former church secretary, to lie to a grand jury
investigating charges against him.
   Hahn was at the Albany County courthouse but did not testify
Monday.
   ``She did tell me that she used cocaine,'' Friedman testified.
   Friedman said Hahn made two telephone calls to Profeta in 1987
that were taped by investigators after she received assurances that
she would not be prosecuted by the state for any crimes relating to
her work with Profeta's Full Gospel Tabernacle Church in Massapequa,
N.Y.
   Profeta's lawyers have asked state Supreme Court Justice Joseph
Harris not to allow transcripts of the calls to be used as evidence.
Profeta pleaded innocent after being indicted in October on charges
he evaded taxes and skimmed church funds to pay for gambling trips
to Atlantic City, N.J.
   Friedman testified that he asked Hahn to question Profeta about
trips the pair allegedly took to Atlantic City. But he denied under
cross-examination by Profeta's attorney that he ``coached'' Hahn on
what to say during the telephone calls.
   ``I explained to her that if this phone call was to succeed she
had to calm down and act naturally,'' Friedman said. ``That's all I
coached her on _ how to act naturally.''
   Hahn testified for two hours in 1987 before a state grand jury
investigating Profeta, breaking into tears afterward as she told
reporters how she turned to Profeta for solace after her affair with
Bakker.
   Assistant Attorney General Peter Crusco also called four
witnesses Monday who worked either at an airfield in Atlantic City
or for a cab company there. They testified they recognized Profeta
from frequent trips to the gambling mecca.
   Profeta, who watched the court proceedings while seated next to
his wife, Glenda, refused to comment afterward. Glenda Profeta also
faces tax evasion charges in the case.

<DATELINE>TAUNGGYI, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a news conference staged to persuade
foreign journalists that Burma's military junta is dealing
magnanimously with the opposition, a student leader suddenly
challenged an army officer.
   It is not true, shouted Myo Win Htun, that students attacked
troops in Taunggyi during last year's pro-democracy demonstrations
as the officer claimed. It was the army _ he asserted to applause
from his colleagues _ that fired into crowds, killing students in
their early teens.
   The outburst appeared to reflect what many Burmese say is a
defiant mood and a widespread, smoldering hatred of Burma's powerful
military _ which had turned its guns on students, Buddhist monks and
others agitating for an end to 26 years of authoritarian rule.
   The deep rift in Burmese society, with its potential for renewed
violence, is but one of a host of problems facing this impoverished
southeast Asian nation now shunned by the international community.
   ``The current situation is complex. The future is bleak and
uncertain,'' said one Burmese journalist.
   The same military that crushed the uprising in September has
promised general elections and allowed more than 180 political
parties to register. It has also attempted to woo the population by
sweeping streets, whitewashing pagodas and providing basic
commodities to the poor at special stores.
   Many of Burma's 38 million people have reacted to such moves with
derision and are watching the power holders for signs of meaningful
change.
   ``If there are no elections we will demonstrate again,'' student
Aung Myint Soe told reporters in the town of Loikaw. ``We have not
given up the struggle for democracy.''
   Such critical statements, made in the presence of officials
during a three-day visit by 46 foreign journalists this month, would
have been unthinkable prior to the upheaval.
   Possibly fearful of another revolt, the military rulers are
allowing more freedom of expression than in the days of retired
strongman Ne Win.
   Although clearly designed to improve Rangoon's tarnished human
rights image, the visit by journalists was also unprecedented in a
country that had virtually barred all foreign reporters and seemed
to care about outside opinion.
   ``We are moving towards an open society. We need foreign
businessmen, investors. And of course journalists must come,'' said
one official who accompanied the press trip.
   However, the new leaders stress that change must come slowly and
view the brutal repression last year as the military elite
exercising its rightful role in saving the country from
``unpatriotic and destructive elements.''
   ``Every country controls mobs. And if they refuse to act
according to the law, you shoot them,'' said one senior military
officer.
   The government says 500 people were killed in September's
violence. Western diplomats put the death toll at double that amount.
   Four months after the Sept. 18 coup by Gen. Saw Maung, a curfew
remains in force along with a ban on public gatherings and tight
control over mass media. With the exception of nursery schools, the
country's educational system has been closed for more than a year.
   Saw Maung has spurned calls for dialogue by opposition party
leaders and rejected one of their major platforms _ reconciliation
with a dozen ethnic minority insurgents who have been battling the
government for decades.
   Instead, the Rangoon military has mounted a major campaign
against one of the strongest rebel groups, the Karen National Union,
and is using up what little foreign currency it earns from the sale
of teak and fish to buy guns and bullets.
   The country's long-suffering economy slid deeper into ruin last
year as the international community, outraged by human rights
abuses, cut off aid. A number of Western analysts say a further
deterioration of living standards could reignite protest as surely
as the negation of political freedoms.
   ``An economic revival under current conditions is almost
impossible. The economy just manages to keep breathing,'' said one
knowledgeable Burmese.
   Most major industrial enterprises remain closed and private
foreign investors are reluctant to enter a politically volatile
situation despite the recent reversal of the country's closed door
policies. Burma is currently unable to repay the interest on its $4
billion foreign debt.
   Many Burmese say they are putting their hope in the promised
elections although there are serious questions about when they will
be held, whether they can be free and fair and whether the military
would accept any victor who might threaten its power and privilege.
   ``I'm not sure whether the government is sincere about holding
elections,'' said 26-year-old student Aung Htu. ``For 26 years the
military has been on top. I don't think they want to give up their
status.''

   Campus police arrested four people
who ran nude around a Perdue University quadrangle in the annual
``Nude Olympics.''
   Two spectators in the estimated crowd of 1,000 at Cary Quadrangle
also were arrested on suspicion of public intoxication and resisting
law enforcement, police said.
   The names of the four streakers, who were released after being
arrested early Sunday on suspicion of public indecency, were not
released, but Sgt. George Bittles said if any were students they
would face disciplinary action from the university.
   Purdue President Steven C. Beering banned the race in 1985,
citing health hazards. Organizers try to stage it on the coldest
night of the year.
   Lafayette recorded an overnight low of 26 degrees.
   The event, about 25 years old, has continued anually despite
Beering's ban. In 1988, 10 men and a woman ran.

   Carl Furillo, a member of the
Brooklyn Dodgers during their glory years in the late 1940s and 50s,
died Saturday at his home. He was 66.
   Furillo was the right fielder on ``the Boys of Summer'' Brooklyn
teams of the early 1950s and a member of the 1955 team that won
Brooklyn's only World Series prior to the Dodgers' move to Los
Angeles in 1958.
   Furillo, known as the ``Reading Rifle,'' was born and raised in
eastern Pennsylvania and retired there in 1960 after ending his
15-year career with the Dodgers in Brooklyn and LA.
   He played in six World Series, with a career batting average of
.299, 192 home runs and 1,058 RBI. In his best season, 1953, he led
the National League with a .344 average despite missing the last few
weeks of the season.

   In a weekend blitz, police, riot
troops and firefighters closed as ``unsafe'' 18 of Rio's principal
nightclubs, home to some of the city's wildest pre-Lenten carnival
balls are held, police said.
   Among the clubs closed were the Scala I and Scala II, hosts to
exclusive carnival balls that cram thousands of costumed revelers
into small spaces, police said Sunday.
   Nightclubs were closed due to inadequate fire escapes, lack of
fire doors in staircases, lack of signs above emergency exits, the
use of highly flammable materials, too few fire extinguishers and
poorly installed electrical systems, police said.
   Rio governor Wellington Moreira Franco said the early February
carnival balls will each be limited to 1,500 people.
   On New Year's Eve, an overcrowded riverboat sank in the open sea
off Rio on the way to a fireworks display. At least 54 people
drowned in the sinking, which led to allegations of bribery and
administrative irresponsibility.

   A report prepared for the Energy Department says
that a perishable gas needed to fuel nuclear weapons could be
produced at two-thirds the cost of the production method now backed
by the department, a newspaper reported.
   An adequate supply of the gas, tritium, could be insured if the
United States built the world's most powerful linear accelerator for
$2.3 billion, according to a story in Monday editions of The New
York Times.
   The Energy Department has told Congress it plans to produce the
gas by building new nuclear reactors for a cost of $6.8 billion, the
Times said. But the accelerator could be built by 1996, at least six
years faster than the reactors, the paper said.
   The report cited by The Times was completed this month by a team
of physicists and engineers from two national laboratories in New
York and New Mexico and a nuclear weapons plant in the state of
Washington.
   The report has not yet been submitted to the Energy Department,
the newspaper said.
   The report says advances in technology have made it possible to
use linear accelerators to produce tritium far more safely and at
much lower cost than nuclear reactors, the paper said.
   Tritium is used to boost the explosive power of thermonuclear
warheads. The United States has been unable to produce it since last
spring when the last of three operable reactors at the Savannah
River Plant near Aiken, S.C., was shut down for repairs.
   The Times quoted Ronald W. Cochran, acting director of the Energy
Department's Office of New Production Reactors, as saying that the
proposal for the accelerator is ``interesting and something we ought
to know more about,'' but ``it's not a substitute for the currently
planned reactors.''

halls with a bullhorn and bat, and chained the doors to keep out
drug dealers.
   He was praised by the Reagan administration, offered a job as a

but show that occasionally.''

   A boyhood problem with dyslexia led Gov.
Gaston Caperton to appreciate the benefits of reading, and he says
elementary school pupils should switch off their televisions and
pick up books.
   During a visit Friday to Pratt Elementary, Caperton told pupils
he had difficulties during his school years because of dyslexia, a
learning disability that affects how the brain processes written
material. Dyslexics often transpose letters, words, numbers and
other things they read.
   Caperton said he was lucky because his problem was discovered
when he was a third-grader and he was able to overcome it.
   ``All of you, be sure you learn how to read. It will open up the
world for you,'' he said, advising the pupils against watching too
much television.

   The commander of the Israeli-backed
militia in southern Lebanon returned to a hero's welcome after more
than two months in an Israeli hospital recovering from an
assassination attempt.
   Villagers greeted Gen. Antoine Lahd on Sunday by slaughtering a
ram, honor, throwing rice and candy at his 12-car motorcade and
following in hundreds of cars along the four-mile route from the
border to his hometown of Marjayoun.
   On Nov. 9, Lahd was shot in the arm and chest by his wife's
21-year-old dance instructor. The Lebanese National Resistance
Front, a coalition of Syrian-backed militias, claimed responsibility.
   Lahd's South Lebanon Army is a predominantly Christian force of
about 2,000 men that patrols a six-to-10-mile-wide ``security
strip'' north of the Israeli border. About 1,000 Israeli troops are
stationed in the zone.

   A snail's pace move is on to change the name of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture to something else, possibly a
name that suggests a broader federal involvement.
   The idea is not new, and USDA, or simply the Agriculture
Department, has survived, in name, at least.
   But the National Advisory Council on Rural Development, in its
final act as the Reagan administration gave way to President Bush,
sent a report to the secretary of agriculture.
   Among other things, the panel recommended that the secretary
``should become the spokesman for rural America, as well as
production agriculture.'' The USDA, it said, should have a rural
development agenda as a primary objective.
   ``To more accurately reflect the ongoing activity in the
department, the council recommends that the secretary support the
expansion of the name of the department to U.S. Department of
Agriculture and Rural Affairs.''
   Some years ago, an ill-fated proposal was made to change the
department's name to reflect its consumer role, much to the
consternation of some farm groups and members of Congress.
   But now there is a serious side for changing USDA's name to
embrace small cities and towns, where the department's programs for
years have been a part of local development efforts.
   The Des Moines Register in an editorial last year said USDA ``has
outlived its time'' and ``should be dismantled and given a different
mission'' in today's world.
   ``Increasingly, `farm' and `rural' are not one and the same,''
the newspaper said. ``Having a good farm policy is not the same as
having a rural policy.''
   Rural America, it said, includes people who live in the
countryside but do not farm for a living. The rural scene includes
14,000 small towns _ Main Street and their businesses.
   The USDA began on May 15, 1862, when President Lincoln signed
legislation creating ``at the seat of government of the United
States a Department of Agriculture.'' The first commissioner of
agriculture was Isaac Newton, who was sworn in on July 1, 1862.
   But it was 27 years before there was a secretary of agriculture.
Here's why:
   When the department was created in 1862, some supporters wanted
USDA to be established as an executive department with cabinet
status. But opponents said it should be operated as a bureau in
another department. A compromise was reached that led to creation of
a separate department, but with a commissioner in charge.
   After some failures and six commissioners, legislation was
finally approved elevating USDA to the cabinet level. Norman J.
Colman, the last commissioner, became the first secretary of
agriculture on Feb. 15, 1889.
   The name has remained unchanged since Lincoln approved it.
   A few early Americans may have had broader horizons than farming
on their minds 200 years ago, even if about 90 percent of the U.S.
population lived on farms at the time.
   In 1785, the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture was
organized. But that was the year, also, that a South Carolina group
``for promoting agriculture and other rural concerns'' was formed.
   While the South Carolina example may be a slender reed in the
agricultural wind, it still suggests that some people in 1785 would
have agreed with the Des Moines Register editorial.
   Alisa Harrison, a Washington representative of the National
Cattlemen's Association, noted in an article last fall that the 1985
farm law ``really tied a knot'' between environmental groups and
farm policy by relating government price supports and other benefits
to compliance with a wide range of conservation requirements.
   As debate opens on a new farm bill to succeed expiring 1985 law,
environmental groups will be ready with proposals ``that will put
them squarely into the farm policy arena,'' she said.
   If a USDA name change is seriously taken up, someone is bound to
suggest the new name be: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural
Affairs, Consumers and Environment. Try having USDARACE stamped on
your beef roast.

<HEAD>Chefs Cook Gourmet Feast for Shelter Residents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A homeless shelter that had expected donations
from an event featuring celebrity chefs instead got the chefs
themselves, preparing a dinner that included crab meat, lamb and
chocolate-covered macadamia nuts.
   ``Obviously, we could use the money and we're sorry that didn't
work out,'' said Mitch Snyder of the Community for Creative
Non-Violence, which runs the 1,400-resident shelter. ``At least
people in our shelter are going to get one nice meal.''
   A commercial event had been scheduled for Saturday night and
Sunday, charging $50 per ticket for Saturday night and $15 for a
Sunday Super Bowl party. The for-profit organization planning it, A
Taste of America, had said it expected to donate $150,000 to
$300,000 from the profits to the homeless shelter.
   The event was canceled late in the week because of last-minute
contract problems with the hall where it was to have been held. But
the chefs were already in town, and they decided since they'd come
to help the homeless, that's exactly what they would do.
   The scene in the homeless shelter's kitchen was chaotic.
   The apron-draped chefs scurried around the alien kitchen,
checking the pantry, surveying the equipment and the volunteer help.
   ``This is how you slice the potatoes. First you cut like this,
then this,'' chef Filippo Milone of The Pillars Restaurant of
Mobile, Ala., instructed the volunteers from the College of St.
Benedict in St. Joseph, Minn.
   ``And the carrots, you peel like so,'' he demonstrated, whisking
a knife edge along the side, flipping the peel at a bemused college
junior, Karla Kohorst. ``Maybe you'll be chefs. It's a beautiful
business, very elegant.''
   Valerie Hart, a senior, said, ``If that's the way he wants me to
peel them, that's what I'll do. Usually we just wash them and chop
them. But I'd never stand in the way of a gourmet meal.''
   Milone then moved to the containers of crab meat, dumped one on a
stainless steel tabletop and showed three other volunteers how to
finger through the meat to find hidden pieces of shell.
   ``Well, we came here to learn things,'' said freshman Jenny
Langenfeld. ``Did I come here to learn how to finger through crab
meat? No,'' she added with a laugh.
   The chefs _ including John P. Hughes III of Windows On the Water
in Kennebunkport, Maine, John Weichman of All Seasons restaurant in
Mobile, Ala., and Daniel Thiebaut of the Mauna Kea Beach Resort in
Kohala Coast, Hawaii _ decided Friday that they'd cook for the
homeless on Saturday.
   ``The original purpose was not only to be part of a national,
historic event, the bicentennial inauguration. It was also to
benefit the homeless,'' said Weichman. ``When the original vehicle
fell apart, we felt we should go ahead.
   ``Hopefully, they'll have a memorable meal and they'll realize
they ate as well as some of the fat cats,'' he said.
   The menu decisions were as impromptu as the cooking lessons, in
part because some of the chefs had managed to cancel their shipments
of expensive items.
   For the original Saturday night event, Hughes had planned to make
his signature lobster-stuffed potatoes, the dish ordered by
President and Mrs. Bush when they stop by his restaurant. But he
managed to stop the shipment of 160 pounds of lobster that would
have cost $2,000.
   Weichman had already brought more than $500 worth of crab meat
with him, and Milone offered to split the cost.
   Thiebaut's company donated lamb, fruit and special colored
chocolate-covered macadamia nuts.
   Compromises abounded and there was no apparent clash of egos as
the chefs conferred on menu possibilities, stirred each others'
sauces, chopped vegetables and tried to keep the whole process
moving.
   In addition to the crab meat with a sauce of bell pepper, onions,
mushrooms and pimentos, they prepared a dish of roasted garlic
potatoes, pasta with a red sauce as well as a lamb dish and salad.
   Snyder said the change was good for the shelter residents.
   ``We normally serve a very nice meal, a hot meal with either
fresh fruit salad or fresh green salad. But ... we don't serve clams
or crab. People around here got all perky about that,'' he said.
   Herman Jackson, 51, of Washington, appreciated the change of pace
from typical shelter fare.
   ``I think it's a very good idea,'' he said. ``I'm thankful for
everything we get.''

<HEAD>Bush Unlikely to Consult with Reagan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan is now in a singular position to
offer advice and help to President Bush, but if history is a guide
he may not be called upon to do so very often.
   ``Bush has got to establish himself as America's leader,'' says
Thomas E. Cronin, professor of American Institutions and Leadership
at Colorado College and author of ``The American Presidency.''
   ``He's going to have a major problem on his hands in starting to
govern because people will compare him to Reagan, who remains very
popular. It will be almost a disincentive to call on Reagan.''
   Bush has not said to what extent he will rely on his predecessor.
His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, did not respond to an inquiry about
the subject.
   But if Reagan plays any important role in decisions of the new
president, he will be the exception to the rule.
   ``One comes away from even a cursory review of the lives of
ex-presidents with a chilling sense of a wasted resource,'' former
Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in 1986 at
dedication of the Carter Presidential Library in Atlanta.
   ``On the whole, their experience was undervalued and their advice
too little sought,'' Christopher, a Los Angeles attorney, said.
   Christopher said one important reason was ``partisan zeal'' _ the
reluctance of Democratic presidents to appear dependent on
Republican predecessors and vice versa.
   This does not, however, explain such things as Reagan's meager
public contact with former Republican presidents Nixon and Ford.
   Reagan did confer privately with Nixon but, Cronin said in a
telephone interview, ``kept him at a distance.'' Reagan had good
reason to avoid being linked publicly with the president forced to
resign by the Watergate scandal.
   As for Ford and Carter, said Cronin, Reagan had ``no contact''
with them except for the time he sent all three living former
presidents to represent the United States at the funeral of Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat.
   Some former presidents have been used more substantially.
   Franklin D. Roosevelt ignored his arch-rival Herbert Hoover, but
Hoover coordinated postwar relief for President Truman and both
Truman and Eisenhower named him to commissions to streamline the
government.
   John F. Kennedy conferred with Eisenhower at Camp David after the
debacle at the Bay of Pigs.
   John Quincy Adams served 17 years in the House after leaving the
presidency, and William Howard Taft became chief justice.
   On the whole, however, said Christopher, ``the former presidents
and indeed the nation have groped uncertainly for a proper role.''
   Now, for the first time since 1861, there are four of them _
Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan. Like the other former presidents,
Reagan gets an office allowance.
   ``Many Americans would ask, `Why do we let these four people
wander around the country playing golf and pushing their books? Why
aren't they serving the public?''' said Cronin. ``A lot of Americans
say we ought to be getting more out of them than we are getting.''
   But, he added, ``it is awkward for an incoming president to know
how to use a former president.''
   Reagan will be 80 in 1991, when Bush's presidency is getting into
full swing.
   ``How do you use an 80-year-old former president who lives 3,000
miles away?'' the historian asked.
   ``I would think Bush would stop in and visit him once or twice
when he is in California, but would not do so until after six
months. Spend an evening with Ronald Reagan updating him on what is
going on and asking his general advice,'' he said.
   Cronin said Reagan might also be asked to help round up
Republican votes on some hard-fought Bush legislative initiative.
   On the other hand, he suggested, former presidents may be the
best judge of the limits of their usefulness.
   ``I think they are all more sensitive than we are,'' he said.
``They have seen what former presidents have said that have possibly
undercut them, and they want to avoid that. They must bite their
lips a thousand times.''

<TEXT>
   A central part of President Bush's first
mini-news conference dealt with his desire to tame one of the most
nettlesome problems that bedeviled his predecessor, the tug of war
between Congress and the executive branch over foreign policy.
   ``We can, I think, do a better job of having Congress understand
initiatives that we might take. Certainly, in some difficult areas,
I need their advice _ I welcome it,'' Bush said Saturday during his
first Oval Office visit with reporters.
   Bush hastened to add, however, that while he'd ``love to think''
that he could turn the clock back to the post-World War II era of
the late 1940s and 1950s, when partisanship stopped ``at the water's
edge,'' he said he wasn't naive about the difficulty of coordinating
policy.
   In his eight years as president, Ronald Reagan was constantly
mired in battles with Congress over such policies as aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels and sending warships to patrol the Persian Gulf,
not to mention disputes over the secret arms deals with Iran.
   The new president has invited the congressional leadership of
both parties to a symbolic meeting at the White House on Tuesday.
They'll discuss not only the budget deficit, but foreign policy as
well.
   ``We're contemplating how we best make clear to the Hill my
determination to ... try to reach for bipartisanship in foreign
affairs,'' Bush told reporters. ``The president has unique
responsibilities under the Constitution for foreign policy and for
national security. But we want, through consultation, to have
Congress in as much as possible on the takeoff.''

   On his first visit to the Oval Office, a
ceremonial occasion mainly for the benefit of news photographers,
President Bush could hardly contain himself.
   ``It's wonderful. I can't wait to get to work. It really feels
wonderful,'' he said with a grin. And then launched into a 17-minute
press conference, despite his vow to never take questions at a photo
opportunity.
   The hostages and the Soviets were only two of the weighty
subjects that came up. And then there was the matter of the
mysterious letter that former President Reagan had left for his
successor.
   The note was handwritten on a pad with the inscription, ``Don't
let the turkeys get you down.''
   Wrote Reagan to Bush: ``You'll have moments when you'll want to
use this particular stationery. Well, go to it.''
   Before he read the note aloud, Bush had a moment of trepidation.
``Am I violating any rules here, Marlin?'' he asked veteran White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``They're your rules, sir,'' said a reporter.
   The new president quickly recovered. ``Oh, I set the rules,'' he
said. ``OK. But we've established one thing, haven't we? That this
is not a photo op.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   He's probably gotten used to it by now.
   But only minutes after he had taken his oath, Bush could perhaps
be excused for failing to respond to his new title.
   Telling the story to congressional leaders Friday at the luncheon
they hosted in his honor, Bush said he, his wife and the Reagans had
negotiated the Capitol's labyrinth of steps when the House
sergeant-at-arms said, ``Mr. President.''
   ``I'm standing there waiting for President Reagan,'' he recalled,
``and I feel something that was between an affectionate hug and a
kidney punch. The silver fox, telling me to get going.''
   The silver fox, by the way, is silvery-haired Barbara Bush.

   In case anyone was wondering, the new White House team will never
win any ballroom dancing awards.
   Bush ventured a few steps of old-fashioned fox trot at each
inaugural ball Friday night, but only after apologizing for his
technique.
   ``You can say that you saw it first here: a lousy dancer trying
to dance his first dance with the first lady of the United States of
America,'' he told revelers at Union Station.
   ``The Bush family is going to give dancing a bad name,'' he said
later at the Pension Building.
   And still later, at the Washington Convention Center: ``I hope
you don't judge my being a president by the way I dance.''
   There will be no relief from his understudy.
   Vice President Dan Quayle told reporters before stepping out that
his wife Marilyn says he is a ``terrible dancer'' and said he would
``keep it to a minimum.'' That he did.
   ``I guess protocol allows you to witness my inability to dance,''
Quayle said at one ball. A few stiff turns with Marilyn and he was
through.

   Ronald Reagan's last official briefing in the Oval Office came
from former national security adviser Colin Powell. ``The world is
quiet today, Mr. President,'' Powell told him.
   His last signature as president went onto a letter to British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, thanking her for her support.
   Photographers took their last Oval Office photos of Reagan and
then he walked, head bowed, toward the door.
   But he stopped before leaving, stopped to turn for one last look
at the oval room that had been for eight years the scene of his
triumphs and trials at the center of power. It was a sweeping,
melancholy look, and then he strode out the door.

   Reagan's departure for Bush's swearing-in ceremony triggered a
different kind of transition.
   Frank Posey, the White House frame-maker, whipped through the
West Wing replacing 70 Reagan family pictures with 70 photographs of
the Bush clan.
   Down came Nancy Reagan in red skirt and pink blouse, down came
Reagan standing in front of his desk. Up went pictures of George and
Barbara Bush, the first couple with all of their children and
grandchildren, the new president fly casting in the surf, the new
president posing with former presidents Ford and Carter.
   Posey did leave one photo intact, Bush with Reagan. And he
performed his task with utmost tact.
   ``We made sure he (Reagan) had left the complex first,'' Posey
said. ``We have a lot of respect for him.''

<HEAD>Stamp Price Surcharge for Charity Opposed by Postal Service</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Postal Service is resisting suggestions to
sell some stamps at higher-than-normal prices and donate the
additional profit to charity.
   Some fund-raisers think Americans would be willing to pay the
extra money, and they're asking the Postal Service to issue the
special stamps.
   Postal officials, however, say the special stamps would be likely
to cause them endless headaches, elicit yawns from the general
public and offend one of their most important groups of clients,
stamp collectors.
   In question is a product known as ``semi-postals'' _ stamps which
have been used for charitable fund raising in other nations. They've
worked in some countries, flopped in others.
   It's an idea put forth regularly, most recently in an October
report from the Institute for Public Policy and Administration of
the Union for Experimenting Colleges and Universities.
   A special stamp might be sold for 35 cents, for example, with a
quarter going to pay postage and the extra dime donated to charity.
Purchasing the special stamps would be a voluntary contribution,
since regular stamps would also be available, the college report
said.
   Citing successful semi-postal programs in Germany and other
nations, the study estimated that as much as $70 million could be
raised by these stamps in the United States.
   ``There is every reason to believe that a semi-postal program
would be well enough received by the public, and significant enough
in its non-profit funding benefits, to justify at least trial
implementation,'' the report concluded.
   But it also noted that the program would require the support of
both Congress and the Postal Service.
   The General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, was
considerably less optimistic when it studied the idea earlier this
year, projecting income at $12 million at best.
   ``Most countries that have conducted semi-postal stamp programs
have not been successful in generating significant surcharge
revenues,'' the GAO found.
   Canada, for example, actively promoted sales of semi-postal
stamps to raise money for its Olympic athletes. Despite the
promotion and wide interest in the Olympics, the public declined to
pay extra for the fund-raising stamps, the GAO said.
   The Postal Service opposes the idea for a variety of reasons
including accounting problems and the potential damage to the
lucrative collectors market, said W.L. Davidson Jr., director of the
agency's office of stamps and philatelic marketing.
   ``We think it would be virtually impossible to decide which
charity to favor every year, we don't know how we could fairly
discriminate among them,'' Davidson said.
   In addition, he said, the agency worries that stamp collectors
would view semi-postals as an unfair tax on their hobby.
   Since collectors generally purchase at least some examples of
every stamp issued by the Postal Service, they don't have the option
of ignoring the higher priced semi-postals as other buyers can.
   ``For them it would be an involuntary contribution,'' said
Davidson.
   Last year the Postal Service had a $170 million profit on sales
of stamps to collectors, a market the agency doesn't want to
endanger by alienating the buyers.

<HEAD>Major Gauguin Retrospective Opens in Paris</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 300 works by Paul Gauguin, the French painter
who rejected middle class comforts to pursue art in the Polynesian
wild, fill the Grand Palais in France's largest retrospective of his
work in 40 years.
   ``Gauguin,'' running through April 24, is a $2-million
co-production with the Art Institute of Chicago and the Washington
National Gallery of Art, which presented slightly different versions
of the show last year.
   The French have not had a comprehensive look at Gauguin since
1949 and they have embraced his works wholeheartedly. The show has
been billed as the blockbuster art event of the season, drawing
about 6,000 visitors daily.
   Critics say the show is highlighted by 11 paintings on loan from
the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad and Moscow's Pushkin Museum, which
rarely leave the Soviet Union. They include ``Pastorales
Tahitiennes'' (1892), a brightly colored bucolic scene Gauguin
believed was his ``best'' Tahitian effort.
   With its flat surface, exotic flowers and sensuous women in
native dress, the work sums up the essence of Gauguin. The distorted
perspective and bold use of color, which he once called a
``profound, mysterious language, a language of the dream,'' would
later influence works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and other 20th
century masters.
   The show begins with Gauguin's early work _ paintings like
``Effect of Snow'' (1883), a wintry village scene reminiscent of
Claude Monet's ``The Magpie.''
   In the early years, working as a stockbroker and painting on
weekends, Gauguin tried to master impressionist techniques. Later,
reacting against realism, he opted for mystery and exoticism.
   Gauguin sought a primitive naturalness where ever he went and
became dependent on it for stimulation.
   In 1886, he left Paris for Pont-Aven in Brittany, where his eye
focused on the elaborate headpieces worn by native women.
   Two years later, he went to Arles, in southern France, where he
painted the same sunflowers and haystacks Van Gogh immortalized.
Later, during two different stays in the South Pacific, he would
depict the tribal rituals and superstitions of ``true savages.''
   Besides bringing together so many remarkable paintings executed
after 1895 when he left France never to return, the Paris exhibition
features two important works not displayed in Washington or Chicago.
   In ``The Vision After The Sermon _ Jacob Wrestling with the
Angel,'' (1888) Gauguin experimented with pure color and reduced all
forms to their outlines. In ``Papa Moe'' (1893) he portrayed a
native woman drinking water from a jungle source against a lush
backround of tropical flora and fauna.
   Also on show is ``Aita Tamari Vahine Judith Te Parari''
(1893-94), a bizarre portrait of a naked Polynesian adolescent
posing with an orange monkey. Anna the Javanese, as she was known,
was 13 years old when she became Gauguin's mistress and accompanied
him back to France from the South Pacific after his first stay there.
   On a visit to Brittany, the flamboyantly dressed Gauguin, Anna
and her monkey were laughed at by sailors, prompting the artist to
pick a fight. He sustained a broken foot and was bedridden for
weeks. Anna left him, returned to Paris and robbed his studio of
paintings and other valuables, leaving him practically destitute.
   The show ends on a optimistic note: the monumental door frame
sculpted in redwood and taken from the hut in the remote South
Pacific island of Marquesas where Gauguin died in misery and
solitude in 1903 at the age of 55.
   Carved with flowers and nude native women, it bears the
inscription ``The House of Pleasure,'' and sums up Gauguin's life
credo _ ``Be in love, and you will be happy.''

<HEAD>McFarlane: Bush Urged End To Iran Arms Shipments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush advised President Reagan at White
House meetings in December 1985 and in the spring of 1986 to end
American arms shipments to Iran, according to a published report
quoting Reagan's former national security adviser.
   The adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, was quoted in Monday's editions
of The New York Times as saying that although Vice President Bush
rarely expressed an opinion at such meetings, he supported McFarlane
in urging that the arms shipments be stopped.
   ``I was struck that he had intervened,'' McFarlane told The
Times. ``That seemed a little bit unusual to me, and I was pleased
that he had.''
   McFarlane advised Reagan to end the shipments because the
operation was not fulfilling its original purpose of ``making
contact with Iranians able to change policy,'' McFarlane told The
Times.
   The former adviser said that later in the meeting, Bush ``nodded
and was kind of pensive and looked over toward the president and
said, `I think Bud's probably right,'' according to The Times.
   Bud is McFarlane's nickname.
   Bush has acknowledged that he knew of the arms sales to Iran as
part of attempts to gain freedom for American hostages, but said he
was unaware of the diversion of profits from the sales to Nicaraguan
Contras.
   His role in the Iran-Contra affair has remained largely a
mystery, although he has insisted that he expressed ``certain
reservations'' about the weapons shipment in private conversations
with Reagan.
   Bush, who led a presidential task force on terrorism, has tried
to minimize his involvement in the Iran arms sale. He claimed he was
``out of the loop'' in making major policy decisions.
   McFarlane's statements are not supported by the reports of
Congressional investigators and others who have studied the
Iran-contra affair, including the diversion of the profits from the
weapons sales to help the rebels in Nicaragua. Other sources have
indicated that Bush was not even present at the December meeting
described by McFarlane, The Times said.
   The reports offer no strong evidence to indicate that Bush urged
Reagan to end the arms shipments.
   McFarlane, who attempted suicide after his role in the
Iran-contra affair became known, is awaiting sentencing on his
guilty plea to harges that he withheld information from Congress
about the shipments.
   Whatever Bush's reservations, the shipment of American weapons
and spare parts to Iran continued into the fall of 1986.

   Serial killer Ted Bundy took responsibility
Sunday for two Idaho murders and as many as eight in Utah,
continuing tearful 11th-hour confessions even though they failed to
bring him an execution delay, officials said.
   Utah authorities had suspected Bundy in the deaths of two women
and the disappearances of three others in 1974 and 1975. But in a
1{-hour prison interview with a detective late Sunday, ``there was
one incident where he mentioned eight,'' Sheriff Pete Hayward said
in Salt Lake City.
   ``Bundy did elaborate on some of the cases, and of course they've
all been tape-recorded and documents marked,'' Hayward said. ``We'll
be looking at it very carefully, to see if what he told us matches
up.''
   Hayward said his investigator described Bundy as uncooperative at
times, and that he seemed ``very tired, putting his face in his
hands, and acting as if he was going to sleep.''
   Idaho state Attorney General Jim Jones said his chief
investigator met with Bundy for about an hour, and that the
condemned prisoner described two murders he committed in Idaho about
1974 or 1975.
   ``One seems to be fairly possible. The other is tough to tell at
this time,'' Jones said in Boise after speaking to investigator Russ
Reneau by phone.
   Bundy provided Washington state and Colorado investigators on
Friday and Saturday with details of at least nine murders for which
he has long been suspected but never charged. By Sunday, however, he
became erratic in his promises as he met with attorneys, a friend
and paralegals.
   Bundy, 42, who is scheduled to die at 7 a.m. Tuesday, broke but
rescheduled an appointment with the Utah detective and canceled a
Monday afternoon news conference with 30 journalists, officials said.
   ``He's got visits scheduled with investigators from Colorado,
Utah and Washington, some of them tonight and some maybe tomorrow,
although we don't know about tomorrow,'' L.E. Turner, assistant
superintendent at Florida State Prison, said late Sunday. ``He may
not have time for all of them.''
   Bundy, who has been on death row at the prison since July 1979,
lost an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a week ago, and no other
court he has turned to since has offered a reprieve.
   Bundy's next step could be an appeal to Anthony Kennedy, the
Supreme Court justice assigned to consider last-minute Florida death
appeals. One justice may stay an execution pending review by the
full court, but Kennedy favors the death penalty.
   In talks with authorities over the weekend, Bundy, who grew up in
Tacoma, Wash., confessed to killing at least eight young women in
that state in 1974, said investigator Robert Keppel of the
Washington attorney general's office.
   Bundy also confessed to the 1975 slaying of Julie Cunningham, 26,
a Vail, Colo., ski shop employee whose body was never found, said
Vail Police Chief Ken Hughey.
   Hughey said Bundy is convinced that the only way he will get to
heaven is to confess.
   ``He's attempting to purge himself,'' said Colorado Attorney
General Duane Woodard. ``It is part of his repenting.''
   ``The man is trying to save his life,'' Keppel told KIRO-TV of
Seattle. He added that Bundy was shaken and tearful as he responded
to questions from investigators.
   Bundy had not previously admitted to any slayings.
   Bundy scrapped his plan to hold a news conference apparently on
the advice of his attorneys, said Richard Shelton, executive
director of the Florida Press Association, which was coordinating
the event.
   Last week Bundy offered to trade information about other slayings
for a delay in his execution, but Gov. Bob Martinez, who signed
Bundy's fourth death warrant Tuesday, said he would not ``negotiate
with a killer.''
   ``Bundy is welcome to talk all he wants, but he better say it by
Tuesday morning,'' said John Peck, press secretary to Martinez.
   Bundy, scheduled to die for the 1978 kidnap-murder of 12-year-old
Kimberly Leach of Lake City, Fla., at one time was linked to as many
as 36 killings and disappearances of young women in Washington,
Colorado, Utah and other Western states. He was being questioned
about the deaths of at least 24 women.
   The law school dropout was visited Saturday by officials from
Washington state and Colorado, said Paul Decker, assistant
superintendent of Florida State Prison near this north-central
Florida town, where Bundy is held.
   Bundy's lawyers lost two more bids for a stay of execution
Saturday. U.S. District Judge G. Kendall Sharp refused to issue a
stay, and then a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta denied Bundy's appeal.
   Diana Weiner, a Sarasota attornovernor delay the execution.
   ``I am not going to do it,'' Eikenberry said.
   Thomas Leach, whose 12-year-old daughter was Bundy's last victim,
nevertheless doubted the execution would proceed, saying, ``They
ain't going to do nothing.''
   Miss Leach disappeared from Lake City Junior High on Feb. 9,
1978. Her body was found April 7, 1978, in a hog shed along the
Suwannee River.
   ``I think it's been dragged on for far, far too many years,''
said Bob Simmons, assistant principal at the school.
   Bundy also has been sentenced to die for the murders of Lisa
Levy, 20, and Margaret Bowman, 21. They were clubbed to death at a
sorority house at Florida State University in Tallahassee.
   Hughey said Bundy acknowledged killing Ms. Cunningham, who
disappeared in Vail in 1975. ``Detectives believe the confession is
indeed valid,'' he said, noting that Bundy's details about the
victim, her clothes and the Vail area have been persuasive.
   In talks with Keppel, Bundy confessed to the eight ``Ted''
murders in Washington state. Witnesses had reported seeing a
charming young stranger who called himself Ted near where several
victims disappeared.
   For the parents of one victim, Central Washington University
student Susan Rancourt, the confession helped write the final
chapter to a tragedy.
   ``It's been an open wound for 15 years, and every time we think
it's settling down, something happens,'' said Miss Rancourt's
mother, Vivian Rancourt, of LaConner, Wash. ``There will always be
that loss that we cannot replace, but at least we can put it all
together.''
   Keppel said Bundy admitted to an additional Washington state
killing, but the investigator was unable to say whether Bundy was
telling the truth or just trying to buy time. Keppel, who earlier
was quoted by KIRO Radio as saying three additional killings were
discussed, said Bundy provided no further details.
   Keppel said Bundy also confirmed the identity of one of the eight
``Ted'' victims as Georgann Hawkins, a University of Washington
student who disappeared from an alley behind her sorority house in
1974. Her remains had never been officially identified.
   Bundy's mother, Louise Bundy of Tacoma, told the Morning News
Tribune of Tacoma that the confessions were unexpected ``because we
have staunchly believed _ and I guess we still do until we hear what
he really said _ that he was not guilty of any of those crimes.''
   ``But if this is true, if Ted did do these things, and if indeed
he is substantiating it with facts that he really did those things
... it's the most devastating news of our lives.''

   In this town where no one wants to be mayor,
Glenn Marshall holds the post but says he doesn't want it, either.
   ``I don't plan to take the job,'' said Marshall, who won a
candidateless election Saturday with 41 write-in votes.
   Only 66 people voted. The remaining votes were cast for nine
other non-candidates.
   The Hamilton County town of about 1,500 located 65 miles
southwest of Fort Worth has been without a mayor since J.M. Blakley
resigned in July after two months. Marshall, who was mayor pro tem,
has been acting mayor since Blakley's resignation.
   An election was called for Saturday to fill the mayoral vacancy,
but no one filed for the office. Marshall said any potential
candidates probably shied away from running because of ``too much
regulation _ state and federal _ down the road.''
   Marshall said he would rather just serve on the town council, for
the mayor votes on matters only to break ties.
   Marshall said he is unsure what will happen when he steps down.
He said the council may appoint a mayor or it may decide to ask the
Texas Municipal League to determine what happens to the post no one
wants.

   A casino owner won $1 million after placing a
Super Bowl bet on the losing Cincinnati Bengals at a rival casino.
   Bob Stupak, owner of the Vegas World casino, walked into Little
Caesar's on Sunday and placed the bundle on the Bengals, plus seven
points, said Little Caesar's owner Eugene Mayday.
   That means that the San Francisco 49ers had to win by more than
seven points in the National Football League championship game for
Stupak to lose his bet. So when the 49ers won, 20-16, Stupak won,
too.
   Little Caesar's has in the past accepted bets of $500,000, and
has one of Las Vegas' highest betting limits.
   Mayday, who paid off the bet after the game in $100 bills, said
he gave the casino owner a $50,000 discount to place the $1 million
bet.
   But Mayday said he didn't let Stupak get away easy.
   ``We made him pay for it. He came in to collect. I told him we
wouldn't pay until he did the Ickey Shuffle,'' Mayday said,
referring to Bengals' running back Elbert ``Ickey'' Woods, who
dances after scoring a touchdown. Woods attended the University of
Nevada in Las Vegas.
   ``Money,'' Mayday said, ``can make people do anything.''

   The dollar edged up slightly against the Japanese
yen Monday, while share prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 128.20 yen, up a small 0.15 yen from
Friday's finish of 128.05 yen. The currency opened at 127.73 yen and
traded mainly in a range of 127.70-128.25 yen during the day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 141.02-point
loser Friday, regained 162.50 points, or 0.52 percent, to finish at
31,332.88.
   The index's gain in Tokyo followed a similar trend on overseas
markets, dealers said.
   Buying orders from Japanese investors increased as the currency
market has become stable and oil prices stopped rising further,
which helped push up the index, one source with a major securities
firm said anonymously.
   On the currency exchange market, trading was mixed with buying
and selling of the dollar for position adjustment after Fridays'
inauguration of President Bush, traders said.
   Many investors stepped off to the sidelines after the inaugural
address, waiting to see what Bush will do to reduce the U.S. trade
deficit, said a dealer with a commercial bank, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In the address, Bush said the United States must balance the
federal budget.
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said Monday morning the
dollar's recent strength is unlikely to continue. He said the
central bank would take appropriate measures against excessive moves
if wide fluctuations occur.
   Sumita also said an upward trend in U.S. interest rates and crude
oil prices were largely responsible for the dollar's firmness.

<TEXT>
   By some accounts, they were an organized
gang of devil-worshipers, by others a loose-knit band of young
misfits gone astray when they attacked their parents, battering one
mother to death with a baseball bat.
   The four teen-agers called themselves Wolverines, and on a
September night carried out or arranged the attacks on four of their
parents in a scheme to run away from home, authorities said.
   Rhonda Macha, 49, was killed. Police say her 15-year-old son,
Michael Beaver, repeatedly swung a baseball bat into her head.
   The other adults survived gunshot wounds.
   ``The crimes being committed by an adult would be terrible
enough. But when you think of it being a 15-year-old and this being
his own mother, it just makes it that much worse,'' said Susan
Lowery, an assistant Fort Bend County district attorney.
   Authorities say the youths planned to steal money, weapons and a
pickup truck and escape to a place where they could live off the
land. Their destinations, however, suggest that the teen-agers were
more vicious than they were sophisticated, prosecutors said.
   ``They wanted to go to either Canada, Louisiana or Port Lavaca,''
Ms. Lowery said, noting that Port Lavaca is just 70 miles away from
their homes in this community southwest of Houston.
   ``That tells you something about their thinking. There are just a
lot of things in this that don't make any sense on a normal level.''
   Prosecutors say 16-year-old Iva Candeleria was the ringleader and
ordered the attacks, including a shotgun assault on her parents.
   ``It's not like she took normal everyday kids and turned them
into criminals,'' says Alan Small, an assistant district attorney.
``They didn't come from good homes. They all had a bad family
situation to start off with, and then they found each other and
agreed to kill their parents.''
   Until the case took a twist Tuesday, the three juveniles charged
in the attacks had been certified to stand trial as adults.
   Miss Candeleria and Beaver now face new hearings because the
psychologist who examined them was charged with misdemeanor perjury
for allegedly lying about notes taken during the exams.
   Richard Lankford, 15, was certified as an adult after examination
by another psychologist. A grand jury was impaneled last week to
consider charges against the boy, who is accused of shooting his
father in the arm with a shotgun.
   The fourth youth, Eugene Lewman, 19, is charged with attempted
murder in the shotgun attack allegedly ordered by Miss Candeleria
against her parents.
   All four are in custody. As juveniles, Miss Candeleria was
charged with conspiracy to commit murder; Beaver, murder; and
Lankford, attempted murder.
   Police reports suggest the group was involved in Satanism,
although prosecutors question whether there were any serious ties to
the occult.
   ``One kid (in the group) was asked one time if he loved the devil
and that's it as far as we know,'' Small said. ``There was no
apparent devil worshiping, no meetings, none of the animal
sacrifices that are generally associated with Satanism.''
   Police estimate there were, perhaps, 10 members in the Wolverines.
   School officials say they have no indication of devil worship
among the Lamar Consolidated district's 12,000 students, but
nevertheless, last November they advised staff to watch for gang and
cult activity.
   ``Certainly this alarms people,'' said Superintendent Ronald
Caloss. ``You hear something like this and you just shake your head.
We don't want to want to underplay it, but we haven't found any sign
of it.''
   Beaver's attorney, Harold Kennedy, scoffed at talk of the occult.
   ``That whole thing has been blown totally out of proportion,''
Kennedy said.
   Attorneys for the three other teen-agers did not return phone
messages left by The Associated Press. None of the parents could be
contacted. A telephone listing could not be found for Miss
Candeleria's parents; there was no answer to repeated calls to the
Lankfords.
   Prosecutors say one of the strangest aspects of the case has been
the unwillingness of the parents to cooperate, even though they were
the targets of the attacks.
   ``When we had the detention hearings the parents wanted them
home,'' Ms. Lowery said. ``It came out in the detention hearing that
the girl had even tried to poison her parents before, and they knew
about it. She put rat poison in their coffee.
   ``They were just misfits,'' she said. ``They didn't fit in
anywhere, and unfortunately they found each other.''

<TEXT>
   A van dispensing methadone will cruise the streets
Tuesday as Boston becomes the nation's largest city to use a vehicle
making the synthetic opiate more available to addicts.
   The state-funded van will make stops at a state mental health
center and at a state hospital, officials said. Two more locations
have yet to be chosen.
   Boston joins the city of Brockton in dispatching a methadone van.
Last month, Brockton became the first in the nation to obtain
federal approval to do so.
   Addicts are given methadone to drink in liquid form. In medically
controlled doses, it satisfies the body's craving for an opiate but
does not produce the sort of high brought by heroin.
   The city is leasing the van for $700 a month, a cost borne by the
state.
   Addicts patronizing the van will be subjected to random urine
tests to ensure they are not using illegal drugs. They also will
receive counseling.
   City officials said that using a van will calm fears residents
have when permanent clinics are in their neighborhoods; it will
allow clients to use the service nearer to where they live, work or
attend school; and it should make methadone available to more people
wanting it to get off heroin.
   A year ago, 242 people were receiving methadone from a city
program set up in a trailer outside Boston City Hospital.
Eventually, the van is expected to assist 110 more people and leave
a waiting list of about 15 people, said Neil Sullivan, a senior
adviser to Mayor Raymond Flynn.

<HEAD>Police: Drug Feud May Be Motive In Arson Fire That Killed Six</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspected drug dealer who had feuded
with a relative of one of six victims of a house fire paid two men
$150 to start the blaze that killed four generations of a family,
police said.
   Aaron O. Frazier and Tino Wedlow, both 17, and James A. Skinner,
32, all of Kansas City, were charged Sunday with six counts of
second-degree murder and one count of arson, said Detective Ed Glynn.
   Bond was set at $1 million each for the three, who remained in
jail today in lieu of bail.
   A fourth man was released Sunday after questioning, police
spokesman Sgt. Gregory Mills said. No other suspects were being
sought, he said.
   One of the men charged was feuding with a family member, who was
not killed in the fire, Mills said. The man, a suspected drug
dealer, paid the two others $75 each to throw a gasoline bomb
through a window of the house before dawn Friday, Mills said,
refusing to be more specific about who did the paying.
   On Thursday night, police responded to a disturbance involving
the family member and the suspected drug dealer, who was arrested.
He was charged with obstructing an officer and having three unpaid
traffic tickets. He was released on bond a few hours before the
fire, and surrendered Saturday, authorities said.
   Among those killed were Velma Coleman, 76, who was bedridden; her
daughter Nola Phillips, 59; Phillips' 19-year-old daughter, Tricia;
and Tricia Phillips' 6-month-old son, Mark Sanders Jr. Also killed
were Jason Addison, 3, and his 2-year-old sister, Courtney.
   Six other people who were in the midtown Kansas City house
escaped, although two were injured.
   Neighbors of the family said Sunday they felt safer now that
someone was behind bars. The suspects are safer, too, they said.
   ``If (the man charged) wouldn't have turned himself in, somebody
would have killed him,'' said 17-year-old Youlanda Sanders, the
baby's cousin.
   Coleman and Nola Phillips were members of Mount Sinai Baptist
Church, which held a prayer service and demonstration for them
Sunday afternoon at the house.
   About 150 members of the church stood around the house as the
Rev. Fate White Jr. prayed and family members cried.
   White said the community could not expect police alone to stop
drug violence.
   ``These are our children that are disrupting this community,'' he
said. ``These are our children that are killing each other.''
   Unified opposition sends a message to drug dealers, he said.

   Texas' leading insect expert said
he fears a media swarm and possible panic more than the arrival of
the so-called killer bees in the United States next year.
   ``I know I'm the guy they're going to be calling,'' said Fowden
Maxwell, head of the Department of Entomology at Texas A&amp;M
University and chairman of the Texas Africanized Honey Bee Advisory
Committee. ``I'm going to be on the hot spot.''
   He predicted the bees will cross the Rio Grande and enter the
United States from Mexico by spring 1990.
   But the insects, though aggressive, may be the victims of bad
press.``Its an unfortunate label,'' he said of the term ``killer
bees.''
   ``We prefer `Africanized honey bee.'''
   The annual death rate from bee stings in Texas is 0.82 per
million, Maxwell noted, saying more people die from wasp stings or
lightning strikes than from bees.
   ``The first person that gets stung or child or old person that
gets killed, you know what's going to happen,'' he said. ``The
public backlash ... ''
   Texas' tourist industry, which pumps $17 billion annually into
the state economy, may be especially hurt, he said.
   ``I think the problem has been overplayed,'' he said. ``I've had
people calling me already afraid to go to the (Rio Grande) Valley
because they want to know when the killer bees are going to be down
there.''
   The bees escaped from a breeding program in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in
1957 and have been migrating northward. They are less than 500 miles
from the Texas border.
   But it's unknown just how far north the bees will go.
   Maxwell speculated the flight will stop north of a line from
Dallas to Fort Worth to Amarillo. But he said other scientists
believe the bees will continue into the northern parts of the
country.
   Texas A&amp;M and the U.S. Agriculture Department are working
together to track the progress of the bees toward Texas. Scientists
hopeful of getting early word when the bees arrive have placed traps
about 10 miles apart along the border from Mission to beyond
Brownsville.
   Maxwell also is seeking more than $250,000 from the Legislature
for more research to study the insects.
   ``It's not that there's going to any real danger, but the public
needs to be aware of the facts,'' he said.
   ``From that standpoint, the educational effort is very important,
so they don't have an undue or excessive or almost hysterical fear.''

<HEAD>Retail Gas Prices Remain Unchanged From Early January Figures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail gasoline prices for the past two weeks
remained virtually unchanged but the pump price may increase because
of a rise in wholesale prices, an analyst says.
   The Lundberg survey of more than 12,000 gas stations for the two
weeks that ended Friday showed the average U.S. pump price for all
grades, including taxes, was 98.25 cents.
   That price was only nine-hundredths of a penny off from the price
reported on Jan. 2. But average wholesale prices jumped more than a
1 1@3 cents during the same two week period.
   Analyst Trilby Lundberg said if the wholesale price rise
continues, many retailers will be hard pressed to pass their
increases on.
   The survey found average price at self-service pumps for regular
unleaded was 87.92 cents per gallon; $1.0407 for premium unleaded;
and 84.66 cents for regular leaded.
   At full service pumps the average price for regular unleaded was
$1.1823; premium unleaded $1.2978; and regular leaded $1.1487.

<HEAD>Strong Quake Strikes Tadzhikistan, Casualties Reported</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT name of USGS. Picks up 3rd pvs, `The

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake shook mountainous Tadzhikistan
in Soviet Central Asia early Monday, destroying buildings and
causing an unspecified number of deaths, the official Tass news
agency said.
   The tremor struck the southwestern part of the republic, located
north of Afghanistan and bordering China, at 2:02 a.m. Moscow time
(6:02 p.m. EST Sunday). It registered 6.0 on the Richter scale,
according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Washington, and seven on
the 12-point Soviet scale.
   The quake caused ``destruction and casualties,'' Tass said.
   Its epicenter was 30 miles southwest of the republic's capital of
Dushanbe near the village of Sharora, the agency said.
   ``Small buildings made from earth were hit especially hard. The
quake caused a serious landslide, some two kilometers (1\ miles)
long, from a hill near the village,'' Tass said.
   The quake also was felt in Dushanbe, but no damage was reported
there.
   It was the strongest quake to hit the Soviet Union since the
devastating Dec. 7 shock that hit northern Armenia 1,300 miles to
the west. That quake destroyed many new apartment buildings and
killed an estimated 25,000 people.
   In some places, the Armenian quake was recorded at a magnitude of
more than 10 on the Soviet scale, which is based on observable
effects of quakes.
   A 7 magnitude quake on the Soviet scale is considered ``very
strong'' and capable of cracking stone walls.
   A quake of 6.0 magnitude on the Richter scale can cause severe
damage in populated areas. The Richter scale is a measure of ground
motion as recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number
means that the ground motion is 10 times greater.

<HEAD>Sakharov Nominated As Candidate, But Election Law Complex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The confusing new Soviet election system could pit
human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov in a campaign battle
against a member of the ruling Politburo and another Communist who
ran afoul of party leaders.
   ``I believe a more democratic mechanism of nominating candidates
is needed,'' said Sakharov, who was selected both as a Moscow
district and at-large candidate for a the new 2,250-member Congress
of People's Deputies.
   More than 900 people jammed into a meeting Sunday that
unanimously nominated the Nobel Peace Prize-winning physicist for
the at-large post in the March 26 elections, an activist said. At
least 500 people waited outside the hastily organized session at the
House of Filmmakers.
   Yuri Mityunov, a participant, said a city Election Commission
member told the meeting that Politburo member Vitaly I. Vorontnikov
and Moscow's deposed Communist Party leader, Boris Yeltsin, were
running for the same at-large seat.
   The still-popular Yeltsin sacked as Moscow party boss in 1987 for
his outspoken criticism of conservatives he blamed for the slow pace
of reforms.
   The possible campaign battle among Sakharov, Vorontnikov and
Yeltskin and the scramble among thousands of candidates nationwide
depends on twists and turns in the new political system charted by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The new congress, announced in December by Gorbachev, will meet
annually and choose the Soviet president and members of a new,
smaller and more active sitting parliament, or Supreme Soviet.
   One third of the deputies are to be chosen from candidates
nominated not on traditional basis of geographic districts but from
the party, unions, professional organizations and other officially
recognized groups.
   Candidates may not espouse views contrary to the constitution,
which enshrines the Communist Party as the leading force in Soviet
society.
   Rank-and-file party members nominated 31,500 candidates for 100
seats. But on Jan. 10 the policy-making Central Committee
recommended 100 of them and the Politburo put them on the ballot.
   Sakharov, 67, was rejected as a candidate by the prestigious
Academy of Sciences last week, causing an angry protest by his
co-workers at the Lebedev Institute of Physics. They then nominated
him as a candidate from Moscow's Oktyabr district.
   With his selection as an at-large candidate, Sakharov must now
make up his mind which seat he will seek.
   His nomination goes to an official electoral commission that will
select the candidates to actually be placed before voters. It could
put forward all of those nominated, but it also could reduce the
number to just one.
   No date has been set for the commission's crucial meeting and the
winnowing process has led to confusion and complaints of
manipulation.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported Sunday that the
Central Council of Trade Unions refused to endorse reformist
economist Tatyana Zaslavskaya because of her call for price
increases to right the economy. It did endorse its chairman, Stepan
Shalaev, who called for more vacation time.
   In Leningrad, Tass said 55-year-old factory worker Gennady
Bogomolov declared a monthlong hunger strike Friday because the
committee at his factory refused to hold a meeting to nominate him.
   Bogomolov, a winner of the government's State Prize, said party
officials pressured the workers' council not to nominate him because
of longstanding differences over pay and restructuring the economy,
Tass said.
   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda displayed on its front page
Friday the text of a telegram saying two scientists and a journalist
had gone on a hunger strike in Stavropol, a city where Gorbachev
once served as Communist Party chief, because city officials refused
to allow them to organize a local nominating meeting.
   The Tass news agency reported on Sunday that Metropolitan Alexei,
whose Russian Orthodox diocese includes Leningrad and Estonia, has
been nominated by workers of an agricultural complex because of his
concern over environmental issues. The law specifically allows
clerical candidates.
   Though there are promises of reform, Soviet churches still are
under Stalin-era laws that require they be registered and prevent
them from organizing religious education or charity.

<HEAD>Text Of Solidarity Statement</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Poland, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The following is the text of the statement
released Sunday by Solidarity's leadership in response to a
Communist Party offer to legalize the banned trade union federation:
   Point 1: The national executive commission of Solidarity treats
the resolution of the plenum Central Committee of the Polish United
Workers Party about bringing back union pluralism and legalization
of Solidarity as a basic step in the direction of social dialogue.
   We expect that this resolution will be followed by an appropriate
decision of state organs. We state that the possibility of
negotiations concerning Solidarity and the matters of the country
has been created.
   Point 2: Solidarity expects of the side of the political and
administrative authorities respect of the rules of union freedom
described according to the international labor organization
convention. We express on our side the will to act according to the
law and according to the statute of our union, in the spirit of the
superior interests of Poland. The program, the membership of its
authorities and the structure of the organization of Solidarity is
going to be democratically decided by its members.
   We expect that all the sides on the public scene are going to put
the profit of the country above all individual interests. It is also
necessary to change legal regulations in order to make it possible
to solve conflict situation in a legal and amicable way.
   Point 3: The dramatic economic, ecological and material situation
of Poland is a widely known fact. The reasons for that are in the
present system of governing. Solidarity for many years has been
demanding deep economic and political reforms.
   Presently there is a possibility of creating wide cooperation in
the fight against the crisis. It calls for an agreement for the
program of reform and plans for activities and the way of social
control. The cost of reforms cannot lower the level of social life
any more. It is necessary to liquidate waste and undertake revision
in the budget expenses of the state.
   Point 4: Solidarity welcomes with pleasure the announcement of
political pluralism. We are in favor of bringing back freedom of
political and democratic organization of public life, in favor of
freedom or organizing groups and milieu, in favor of realistic
independence of courts and judges, and in favor of freedom of speech
and access to the mass media.
   Point 5: The national executive commission of Solidarity is of
the opinion that it is necessary to start negotiations as soon as
possible. They should have a realistic and concrete character and
public opinion should be informed about it fully.

<HEAD>FIGUERAS: 250,000 people.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A founder of the surrealist movement, Dali is the last of an
outstanding generation of Spanish painters that included Pablo
Picasso and Joan Miro.
   To most critics, Dali was a flawed talent _ sometimes managing to
ably balance realistic technique and irrational content, but all too
often caught up in his own role as a poseur-painter. He completed
most of his critically successful works before he was 35.
   Dr. Carles Ponsati, the head of Figueras Hospital and the
painter's personal physician, said death came at 10:15 a.m. (4:15
a.m. EST).
   ``The cause of death was cardiac arrest brought on by his
respiratory insufficiency and pneumonia,'' Ponsati told reporters.
   Dali was rushed to the hospital four days ago from his home in
this city near the French border. The painter, who suffered chronic
heart ailments in recent years, had been hospitalized three times
since late November.
   He had been in poor health since suffering severe burns in an
electrical fire in his home in August 1984. After recovering from
his injuries, Dali was confined to a wheelchair.
   The Dali Theater-Museum, where the artist will be buried, was
closed Sunday so 12 workers could build the tomb, expected to be
finished in about two days, said the secretary of the Gala-Dali
Foundation, Francisco Verges.
   Verges said Dali's tomb will be located in the inner court of the
museum, just beneath a great glass dome crowning the building in
Figueras, the Catalonian town where Dali was born on May 11, 1904.

<HEAD>Victims' Relatives Relieved By Bundy's Confessions; His Mother Devastated</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bundy, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives of some murder victims said they were mostly relieved
to hear about Ted Bundy's confessions, but at least one remained
incredulous that he will go to the electric chair and one wanted to
watch him die.
   Meantime, Bundy's mother said she was ``going through hell.''
   Thomas Leach, whose 12-year-old daughter, Kimberly, was Bundy's
last victim, doubted the execution would proceed, saying, ``They
ain't going to do nothing.''
   But Kimberly's uncle Frank Fender wants to witness Bundy's
execution for killing his niece, who disappeared from Lake City
Junior High on Feb. 9, 1978.
   ``I want to look in his eyes and see him before they put the hood
on,'' Fender said, referring to the dark hood placed over an
inmate's head just before electrocution. State policy bars victims'
relatives from attending executions, but a state official promised
to review the request today.
   Eleanore Rose of Burien, Wash., said she ``felt a hatred even
stronger than I had ever felt before'' when she learned the
42-year-old law school dropout had confessed to killing her
19-year-old daughter, Denise Naslund.
   ``I can hardly wait for Tuesday to come,'' she said, referring to
Bundy's scheduled execution in Florida. ``It's like he completely
governed my life, my existence. Just waiting, waiting.''
   Dale and Vivian Rancourt of LaConner, Wash., parents of victim
Susan Rancourt, 18, said Bundy's confession in her slaying and his
execution would end their 15-year-old ordeal.
   ``It's like a big puzzle that's been going on for ... years for
us,'' said Rancourt. ``There (were) two pieces left. One was the
absolute, absolute, (confirmation) from the words of the
perpetrator. The other will be his execution, and then the puzzle is
complete.''
   ``When this is over, I think we can finally start the end of the
healing process,'' Mrs. Rancourt added. ``It's been an open wound
for 15 years, and every time we think it's settling down, something
happens.''
   Bundy was sentenced to death nine years ago in Florida, but the
execution repeatedly was delayed by his appeals.
   Rosemary Arnaud, mother of 22-year-old Brenda Ball, who
disappeared outside a Burien, Wash., tavern in 1974, said Bundy's
death will be a relief only in the knowledge that he will never be
able to kill again.
   Bundy's mother, Louise, who lives in Tacoma with his stepfather,
John Bundy, said the confessions were unexpected ``because we have
staunchly believed _ and I guess we still do until we hear what he
really said _ that he was not guilty of any of those crimes.''
   ``But if this is true, if Ted did do these things, and if indeed
he is substantiating it with facts that he really did those things
... it's the most devastating news of our lives.
   ``We're going through hell. ... We're suffering a lot. We didn't
want him to do this.''
   She said her anguish was not only for her family, but for the
families of the victims.
   ``I agonize for the parents of those girls,'' she said. ``We have
girls of our own, who are very dear to us. ... Oh, it's so terrible.
I just can't understand.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea agreed today to a communist
North Korean proposal for preliminary political talks next month and
said the two nations were within sight of ending their bitter
rivalry.
   South Korean Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon accepted a North
Korean plan for preliminary talks Feb. 8 to set terms for major
talks headed by premiers of the two nations on ways to end their
40-year confrontation.
   ``The south and the north have crossed the threshold to open a
new era of reconciliation and cooperation by coming out of an old
era of antagonism and confrontation,'' Kang said in the letter
turned over at the Panmunjom border truce site.
   North Korea agreed Jan. 16 to a South Korean proposal to upgrade
proposed political and military talks to the prime ministerial level
in what would be the highest level contact between the two sides
since the Korean War.
   The two sides will hold preliminary talks at Panmunjom Feb. 8
with five-member delegations headed by vice ministers to set terms
for the premiers' talks.
   In a seaparate development today, North Korean Olympic Committee
chief Kim Yu Sun sent a letter to the south proposing a meeting
March 9 at Panmunjom to discuss the two Koreas fielding a joint team
at the Asian Games in Beijing in 1990.
   The North Korean letter, which was also turned over at Panmunjom,
said the north was convinced that an agreement could be reached if
the two sides talked in an ``atmosphere of mutual reconciliation and
trust.''
   The two Koreas are involved in an unprecedented series of
contacts ranging from parliamentary negotiations on a possible
non-aggression pact to economic, cultural and personnel exchanges.
   The talks headed by the two prime ministers are to consider
resolving political and military disputes between the two rival
nations.
   Delegations of lawmakers from the two sides have been holding
separate meetings on trying to set terms for full-scale talks
between the north's and south's legislatures on peace-building
measures.
   South Korean officials hope the totalitarian north may be ready
to seek improved relations and an end to the long rivalry for
control of the divided Korean peninsula.
   But there are indications North Korea also hopes to use the talks
to try and secure withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops based in the
south under a mutual defense treaty and that it is still unwilling
to accept the Seoul government.
   The two Koreas are technically still at war since no peace treaty
was signed in 1953 at the end of the Korean War. Boths sides have
hundreds of thousands of troops facing each other along the border
and there have been frequent clashes over the years.
   Korea was divided by U.S. and Soviet troops who ended the
Japanese occupation in 1945 at the end of the Second World War.

   Where once there had been riots, an ice cream truck
attracted hungry children. A group played basketball, friends worked
on a car engine.
   Next door to a looted, burned-out grocery store, three youths sat
in lawn chairs and watched a portable television.
   Throughout Miami's impoverished, troubled black neighborhoods of
Overtown and Liberty City, Sunday's Super Bowl preempted any
lingering racial tension.
   A crack deal was visible on one corner at game time. A youth
whose friends said he had been involved in the rioting cruised the
neighborhood in a rented car and flashed a wad of cash.
   Just a typical Sunday, residents said.
   Even police officers manning barricades and strike teams called
``field forces'' sat on squad car hoods watching the game, eating
potato chips and giving the latest score to passing motorists.
   ``There's more excitement about the game now than about what
happened,'' said Anthony Burnes, a resident of Overtown's public
housing projects who donned a Bengals T-shirt while watching the
game with friends.
   ``Everything seems normal now.''
   Not everything. When a window shattered at an apartment complex
across from the TV-watching police field force in Liberty City, an
officer immediately drew his gun and crouched behind his car.
   ``These guys are dead tired,'' said the commander of the force,
who declined to give his name because he normally works undercover.
   And late Sunday, a black man who fired on two police officers in
Liberty City was shot by one of the officers, authorities said. The
man was listed in ``stable but not critical condition,'' Jackson
Memorial Hospital officials said.
   Three nights of rioting last week were sparked by the fatal
shooting of an unarmed black motorcyclist by a Hispanic policeman.
   A panel of police officers and Overtown residents that was
established by the city to investigate the shooting was holding its
first working meeting today. In addition, various local, state and
federal agencies are investigating.
   With the violence barely subsided, police at Joe Robbie Stadium
north of Miami kept security extra tight for the Super Bowl, in
which the San Francisco 49ers defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 20-16
before a sellout crowd of more than 75,000.
   Some 300 officers maintained checkpoints at the game and allowed
only ticket-holders close to the stadium.
   The biggest security problem, however, appeared to be coping with
fans who had their wallets _ or worse, their tickets _ lifted by
pickpockets. Two dozen arrests were made, police said.
   Police posted barricades around the black neighborhoods at
nightfall, but aside from the police shooting, there were no reports
of unusual violence.
   In Miami Beach, a few miles to the east, the scene was anything
but calm. Several thousand football fans and sun-worshippers clad in
bathing suits gathered around a giant TV screen outside a beachfront
bar to watch the game while sitting in the sand.
   ``This is the place to be,'' said Katie Carrillo, a Bears fan
from Chicago. ``You can watch the game and look at all these men.
We're here for the men.''
   The rioting left one man dead, and 11 others were treated for
gunshot wounds. Thirteen buildings were torched and others looted,
and 372 people were arrested in three nights of unrest, authorities
said.
   Fans said the violence didn't scare them away from the Super Bowl
showdown.
   ``It didn't bother me,'' said Frances Schroder, a 49ers season
ticketholder from Placerville, Calif. ``We were going to come even
if there was a hurricane, an earthquake, or whatever.''

   Afghan guerrilla leaders said today
they have delayed convening a council to form an interim government
because of differences between Pakistan- and Iran-based insurgents.
   Qaribur Rehman Saeed, a spokesman for the Hezb-i-Islami insurgent
group, said the Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance was sending a
delegation to Iran to try to persuade insurgents there to
participate in the consultative council.
   Because it has been delayed from Feb. 1 to Feb. 10, the meeting
will come just five days before the Soviet deadline for ending its
nine-year involvement in Afghanistan's bitter civil war.
   The meeting is to be held near the Pakistani border town of
Peshawar.
   Saeed said the dispute centers on the proportional repesentation
of the mainly Sunni Moslem rebels based in Pakistan and the smaller,
Shiite groups operating from Iran.
   Four of eight Iran-based groups announced over the weekend they
would boycott the council meeting because too few seats were
allotted to them.
   The Peshawar-based alliance labored over the weekend to choose
420 representatives from its ranks _ 60 from each of the seven
parties.
   Guerrilla leaders also assigned their Iran-based comrades 60
seats despite their demand for 120 of the 480 seats.
   ``They are not satisfied, but I think we can compromise,'' Saeed
said.
   Shiites comprise about 17 percent of Afghanistan's population,
but make up about 40 percent of the Afghans who have fled their
country since 1978, when a Marxist government seized power in a
military coup.
   Soviet forces intervened a year later to replace one Marxist
government with another, then remained to help it fight a growing
insurgency.
   Of the estimated 15 million Afghans, one-third now live outside
Afghanistan _ 3 million in Pakistan and 2 million in Iran.
   Guerrilla leaders have resolutely refused to include members of
the Kabul government, whom they view as traitors, on the council,
whose task is to choose a transitional government and approve a
temporary head of state.
   That government is to oversee the election of a 350-member
Parliament through balloting over three months from Feb. 1 among
Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran, and among Afghans living in
rebel-controlled areas of their own country.
   The Parliament, in turn, is to approve a new constitution and
oversee a general election sometime within a year. The election
would produce a permanent, post-war Afghan government.
   The Soviets agreed under a U.N.-mediated accord to withdraw their
100,000 troops by Feb. 15. Half left by Aug. 15, and the Soviets
have said they would honor the Feb. 15 deadline.
   There is widespread fear of chaos if the fractious guerrillas do
not agree on a political solution before the deadline.
   ``If they don't get their act together, and fast, we may not see
an end to the war,'' said a Western diplomat in Islamabad, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Some Western diplomats believe the Kabul regime will fall quickly
once the Red Army is gone and the mainly-conscripted Afghan army is
left to face the rebels alone.
   Others predict that a huge stockpile of Soviet arms and
ammunition left behind may enable the government to hold onto major
Afghan cities for months.

<HEAD>Opposition Victory Deals Gandhi Setback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MADRAS, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in the key southern state of Tamil
Nadu dealt Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi a major political setback by
overwhelmingly rejecting his party in legislative elections, results
showed today.
   The prime minister, who must call nationwide elections this year,
had campaigned at least nine times in the state since September and
Saturday's balloting was considered a barometer of his popularity.
   Gandhi's Congress Party won just 26 of the 232 contested seats in
the state legislature while the Dravida Progressive Front and its
allies captured 170 seats, said the chief state electoral officer,
D.K. Oza.
   ``It's a verdict against Rajiv Gandhi,'' the leader of the
victorious party, Muthuvel Karunanidhi, told hundreds of cheering
supporters who gathered outside his home in central Madras. ``I hope
this victory is repeated in the national elections.''
   The Hindu newspaper of Madras today called the results ``a severe
blow to the image and prospects of the party in power _ which went
out of the way to make this appear a contest of vital political
significance.''
   The results of the national parliamentary balloting, which Gandhi
must by law call by December, will determine who leads India for the
next five years.
   Early returns today showed Gandhi's party leading in the states
of Mizoram and Nagaland, which have a history of insurgency and
unrest, news reports said.
   The Congress won eight seats in the 60-member assemby in
Nagaland, while its only challenger, the Nagaland People's Council,
had six, according to United News of India.
   In Mizoram, Gandhi's party led in a three-way race for the
40-seat assembly. Congress captured six seats, compared with two for
the Mizo National Front and one for the People's Conference, the
news agency said.
   Gandhi campaigned in all three states, but most of the attention
centered on Tamil Nadu, where the Dravida Progressive Front regained
power after 12 years.
   The party was backed by Gandhi's most visible national political
foe, V.P. Singh, a former finance and defense minister for Gandhi.
Singh is trying to unite an unruly coalition of three opposition
parties in northern India to challenge Gandhi in the national
parliamentary election.
   ``The results (in Tamil Nadu) will have an effect on the national
politics,'' said Cho Ramaswamy, a respected political commentator.
``V.P. Singh will project the DMK's victory as his own and many
members of the Congress Party will be jittery.''
   Karunanidhi, 66, served Tamil Nadu's chief minister _ the state's
highest elected official _ from 1967 to 1976. He then lost to
actor-politician M.G. Ramachandran, who governed until his death in
December 1987.
   The remnants of Ramachandran's party, which split into two
factions led by the actor's former leading lady and by his widow,
won 33 seats in Saturday's balloting. Independents led in two
districts, and final results were pending in eight others.
   Elections were postponed in two others because candidates died.

   An earthquake destroyed several mountain villages
in Tadzhikistan today, causing a landslide that buried one under a
30-foot wall of dirt and mud, officials said. Preliminary estimates
put the death toll at 1,000.
   ``Almost everybody died,'' said Zainiddin Nasreddinov,
editor-in-chief of the official Tazhiktan news agency, who visited
the buried village of Sharora in Soviet Central Asia.
   Sixty-nine families lived in the village, and a preliminary
estimate indicated about 600 people had died there, he said in a
telephone interview from Dushanbe, about 10 miles to the northeast.
   After the quake, a wall of dirt and mud slid from a nearby hill
and buried Sharora, he said.
   Seventy more people were estimated to have died in the villages
of Akulibolo and Akulipoyen, located at the epicenter 20 miles from
Dushanbe, the capital of the republic.
   ``Everything is destroyed _ all the homes, the schools, the
hospitals and clinics, the stores,'' he said.
   Communications, electricity and water were disrupted and many
injured had been to hospitals in Dushanbe and other large cities, he
said.
   He said many other villages had been damaged as well.
   A government commission that began work this morning made a
preliminary estimate of about 1,000 dead, Nasreddinov said.

   PTL founder Jim Bakker has selected as his
attorney a flamboyant octogenarian whose legal career spans six
decades and whose clients have included Alfried Krupp at the
Nuremberg trials.
   George T. Davis may not be a household name like Melvin Belli or
F. Lee Bailey, but he has defended some notable clients, including
Krupp, heir to the German munitions empire who was convicted in 1948
of war crimes and sentenced to 12 years. He was released after three
years.
   Among the others: Caryl Chessman, who was executed for kidnapping
two women and sexually assaulting them in 1948, and labor agitator
Tom Mooney, who was sentenced to death for his participation in the
1916 bomb killings of 10 people in California. Mooney was given an
unconditional pardon in 1939.
   Throughout Davis' long career, his courtroom style often has been
colorful.
   ``I always try my cases a little differently,'' Davis said.
``Let's just leave it at that.''
   His background includes paying his way through the law school of
the University of California at Berkeley in the 1920s by playing
drums in a jazz band. He has studied hypnosis, portrayed himself in
a documentary, and is writing a book about the death penalty.
   At 81, Davis remains active, as evidenced by his workout before
an 8 a.m. interview last week. He still finds time to work on his
horse ranch in Hawaii, where he lives with his fourth wife, Ginger.
Davis walks his dog for an hour every morning and he occasionally
surfs.
   Explaining that he didn't want to jeopardize chances of getting a
gag order he sought last week, Davis agreed to discuss the PTL case
only in general terms and his impressions of his client.
   Bakker, 48, and his former top deputy, Richard Dortch, 57, were
accused in a Dec. 5 indictment of diverting more than $4 million in
PTL funds for their personal use. Two other former aides, brothers
David and James Taggart, were accused in a separate indictment with
federal tax violations.
   All four have pleaded innocent to the charges, which came at the
end of a 16-month grand jury investigation. Bakker's U.S. District
Court trial has not been scheduled.
   Davis, who spent most of his career in San Francisco before
moving to Hawaii, met Bakker the day the indictments were issued.
   He was introduced to Bakker through a mutual acquaintance, a
Texas minister. Davis, no supporter of Bakker's ministry in the
past, did not discuss his religious views nor did he cite religion
as a motive.
   Neither was it money or prestige that persuaded him to take the
case, he said.
   ``This is one of my `cause' cases,'' he said. ``I've always been
motivated to help people. This case is complicated and it's
difficult. It just fits into what my whole lifetime motivation has
been.
   ``For that reason I was ready to make the sacrifice, and believe
me, there's no amount of money that could cover the sacrifice of
giving up four to six months of my time. At this stage, it is worth
... a lot more than any money.
   ``It's like a glass of water on the desert. How much is it worth?
It's worth a lot more if it's the last glass.''
   Davis' first impression of Bakker persuaded him to take the case.
   ``I don't think he's a criminal,'' he said. ``I think he was
overwhelmed by the immensity of the work that he was doing.
   ``When you stop to think of all the operations he was running and
funding and handling and the need that he had for help, for
assistance, he's really not a managerial type. He's a minister,''
Davis said. ``My whole judgment of him is that he's a decent, honest
man of his word.''
   Moreover, it doesn't bother him that Bakker is not universally
loved.
   ``Almost every case that I've ever handled has been for a
defendant who at the time he crossed my threshold was considered a
despicable guy,'' he said. ``That part doesn't bother me at all.''

<TEXT>
   Video pirates broke into a cable TV system's
broadcast of the Super Bowl game, disrupting a few seconds of the
audio with music from ``The Jetsons'' and an anti-Semitic slur,
viewers and cable officials said.
   ``First there was music from `The Jetsons' cartoon show. Then
someone said something about Century Cable and `there's too many
(expletive deleted) Jews in this industry,''' Santa Monica viewer
Doug Debber said Sunday.
   Debber said another person laughed and said, ``You're not
supposed to say that on television.''
   Kyle Smith, general manager of Century Southwest Cable
Television, said the interruption was heard in an area in which the
system has 100,000 subscribers.
   ``We don't know what happened, exactly. We do know that somebody
came on the system and made some anti-Semitic comments,'' said Bill
osendahl, vice president of the Santa Monica-based company.
   ``I'm baffled at how it was done and I'm shocked and outraged at
the statements that were made,'' said Rosendahl.
   Company officials called the FBI and police and planned to get in
touch with the Federal Communications Commission today, he said.

<HEAD>South Africa Names Envoy, Agrees To Cut Police Force In Namibia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South Africa today named a
special envoy to Namibia and said it was willing to remove 2,300
police officers from the territory as it prepares to grant
independence to Africa's last colony.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia, also known as South-West Africa,
for 74 years, but has agreed to begin implementing a United Nations
independence plan April 1. Elections are to be held Nov. 1.
   South Africa has an estimated 50,000 soldiers in Namibia. Under
the U.N. plan, the force is to be reduced to 1,500 by the end of
June.
   The government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. reported that
Willem Retief, South Africa's ambassador to West Germany, has been
named special envoy to Namibia.
   Retief will serve as a liaison between Namibia's current
transitional government and the U.N. special representative to the
territory, Marthi Ahtisaari, the news agency said.
   South Africa's acting president, Chris Heunis, planned to meet
today with local government officials from Namibia to discuss the
transition to independence.
   Heunis, serving as president while P.W. Botha recovers from a
stroke, met Friday with the Namibian Cabinet for similar talks.
   The United Nations in 1966 revoked South Africa's League of
Nations mandate to govern Namibia.
   Since then, the South-West Africa People's Organization has been
waging a guerrilla conflict for independence. The group is widely
regarded as the favorite to capture the November elections.
   U.N. peacekeeping troops are expected in Namibia by April, but
the size of the force has not been determined.
   Black African nations and non-aligned countries want the United
Nations to dispatch 7,500 troops at a cost of about $700 million.
However, the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council,
including the United States, will pay most of the cost and want to
limit the force to about 4,500 soldiers.

<HEAD>Klansman's Showing In Louisiana Election Seen As Possible Setback

   A mainstream Republican says he believes
former Klansman David Duke will receive at least one-third of the
vote in a runoff election next month for state representative _ as
he did in Saturday's primary.
   If that happens, ``I think it would be damaging to Louisiana's
political image,'' said John Treen, who received 19 percent of the
primary vote.
   Treen, who got 2,277 votes, faces Duke in a Feb. 18 election to
represent the 99 percent white area of Jefferson Parish.
   ``I think if he (Duke) loses the election it will reaffirm some
people's belief that Louisiana is making progress,'' said Treen,
whose brother, David, was Louisiana's first Republican governor
since Reconstruction.
   But, Treen said, ``I think if he were to win the election it
would be news and it would be damaging to our political reputation
and to our image and that it would probably impair investment in
this area.''
   Although Treen, 62, said Saturday night that he doubted Duke
would get more votes in the runoff than the 3,995 he received in the
primary, he had changed his mind by Sunday night.
   ``From an analysis of precinct returns, who got what vote where,
I think that he will run substantially stronger than one-third of
the vote,'' he said.
   Duke, 38, who founded the National Association for the
Advancement of White People after leaving the Klan in disgrace in
1980, said he's not a racist and he thinks it's unfair that his past
as an imperial wizard in the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan continually
gets mentioned.
   ``I was never involved in the old Jim Crow system,'' he said. ``I
believe in equal rights for everyone. That's what I've advocated;
that's what I've preached; that's what I believe in.
   ``The real racists are the ones who believe in affirmative
action.''
   He said his proposal for incentives to get welfare recipients to
accept sterilization to cut the illegitimate birthrate isn't a
racial issue.
   ``The media reported it as black illegitimate welfare. I've only
said illegitimate,'' Duke said. ``They're the ones who suppose
illegitimate welfare recipients are black.''
   Duke said his showing Saturday indicates that his views appeal to
more people than is generally realized.

   A police officer shot a black sniper in a
neighborhood torn by riots last week, but a recurrence of the
violence that left one dead and stores looted and burned seemed
unlikely, authorities said today.
   ``It's under control. It's all quiet,'' Police Sgt. Robert
Edwards said a few hours after late Sunday's shooting in the Liberty
City section.
   The wounded man, David Ford, 20, was in ``stable but not critical
condition'' at Jackson Memorial Hospital, said hospital spokesman
Mark Santo.
   No charges were filed against Ford pending a police
investigation, said Metro-Dade police Detective Lucy Fitts.
   The man fired on two police officers who had been called to
assist firefighters at a house fire, police Sgt. William Harvey
said. One of the officers, Paul Chahal, 26, returned the gunfire,
striking the sniper, Harvey said.
   ``There were a lot of civilians at the scene and there was no
adverse reaction,'' he said. ``They saw the officers were shot at
first and were acting in self-defense.''
   The shooting came near the end of a quiet day in which the
riot-weary city was host to the Super Bowl.
   Police put on shows of force in the troubled black neighborhoods
of Liberty City and Overtown, where the shooting of a black
motorcyclist a week ago today triggered three days of rioting.
   Many residents of Overtown spent Sunday washing cars, playing
basketball, cruising the streets past housing projects and watching
the San Francisco 49ers defeat the Cincinnati Bengals 20-16.
   ``There's more excitement about the game now than about what
happened,'' said Anthony Burnes, 28, who donned a Bengals T-shirt to
watch the game with friends.
   ``Everything seems normal now.''
   A panel of police officers and Overtown residents were scheduled
to hold their first working meeting today to investigate the
shooting of Clement Lloyd, 23, who was shot in the head by Officer
William Lozano while being pursued by another officer for speeding.
   Lloyd was to be buried today.
   His passenger, Allen Blanchard, 24, who suffered fatal injuries
when the motorcycle crashed, was buried Saturday.
   The Hispanic officer is on leave with pay pending the probe by
local and federal authorities.
   Miami had agonized about the tarnish to the city's image from
rioting during what was supposed to be a week to showcase the city
to the world.
   ``Put parties, anxiety behind: It's game day,'' implored a banner
headline in The Miami Herald on Sunday.
   Police allowed only Super Bowl ticket-holders close to Joe Robbie
Stadium north of Miami. Twenty-four people were arrested on the
stadium grounds on charges ranging from theft to loitering during
the Super Bowl.
   ``We didn't get mugged at all. We were going to stay in the hotel
because of the rioting, but we were a long ways from it,'' Pat
Murphy of Great Falls, Mont., said outside the stadium. ``I didn't
see anything going on. ... I'll come back.''
   Rioting by blacks left one man dead, and 11 others wounded with
gunshots. Thirteen buildings were torched and others looted, and 372
people were arrested, authorities said.
   About 150 of those arrested were unable to post $250 bail and
would not be arraigned again until today, police said. If they plead
guilty, they probably would be released for time served, said Sgt.
Mike Mazur, a police spokesman.
   On Sunday morning, New York civil rights attorney C. Vernon Mason
and two members of Miami's black community announced formation of
People United For Justice In Miami.
   Mason said the group is in response to ``a national epidemic'' of
police violence against blacks. Local leaders called for creation of
citizen patrols and for the arrest of Lozano.

   A Hong Kong company signed a $30 million contract
today to fire an American-built satellite into space on a Chinese
rocket _ the first time communist China will launch a foreign-built
satellite.
   ``This marks China's first step in the international satellite
business,'' said Terry Seddon, chief executive of Asia Satellite
Telecommunications Co., which signed the deal with the state-owned
China Great Wall Industrial Corp.
   It is for the launch of AsiaSat 1 in April 1990.
   China will be sending two other American-made satellites into
space in July 1991 and February 1992 for an Australian satellite
company, Aussat, Chinese officials said.
   In addition, negotiations are under way for the Chinese launching
of a second satellite from AsiaSat and a weather satellite from
Sweden. AsiaSat 1 and the two Aussat satellites were made by the
U.S.-based Hughes Aircraft Co.
   The launchings in an unmanned rocket will provide China with
much-needed foreign exchange and, if successful, help cement its
position in the world of international aerospace.
   Since 1984, China has launched four of its own communications
satellites successfully. It started launching satellites in 1970 and
has had 23 successful firings and one failure.
   In December, the United States agreed to allow China to launch
American-built communications satellites after Beijing promised it
would neither steal American satellite technology nor undercut
private American launch companies.
   China said it would limit itself to launching nine foreign
communications satellites over the next six years.
   According to some estimates, China's state-subsidized rocket
industry charges 30 to 50 percent less per launch than its American
or European competitors.
   AsiaSat 1 will be sent into orbit 21,700 miles high on a Long
March 3 rocket from China's launching site in Xichang, Sichuan
province. Company officials said total expenditures on AsiaSat are
$120 million and they expect to start making a profit in five years.
   China will use most of the satellite's 24 transponders for
domestic communications.
   The launch will be AsiaSat 1's second trip in space. In 1984,
under the name Westar VI, it was sent up on the American Space
Shuttle but a rocket motor malfunctioned and the satellite was not
delivered into orbit.
   It was retrieved in a spectacular salvage operaton in 1985 and
sold to AsiaSat, the company owned by a consortium consisting of
Cable and Wireless of Britain, the state-owned China International
Trust and Investment Corp., and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., one of Hong
Kong's biggest companies.

today.
   South Korean Defense Ministry officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said about 10 Soviet planes were met and monitored during
their maneuvers Saturday off South Korea's west coast.
   Up to 20 South Korean and U.S. Air Force jet fighters kept watch
on the Soviet TU-95, TU-142 and TU-16 bombers, they said.
   Soviet military aircraft sometimes pass near South Korea flying
between Soviet bases in Siberia and Vietnam, but usually just one or
two at a time, the defense officials said. South Korean and U.S.
specialists were conducting an analysis to try to explain the
movement of large numbers of Soviet planes, the officials said.
   The U.S. 7th Air Force is based in South Korea with other U.S.
forces under a mutual defense treaty.

   More than 500 students gathered at a main square
in the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin to demand severe
punishment for a classmate's attackers and greater campus security,
a newspaper reported today.
   Harbin University of Technology students drew a crowd of about
9,000 onlookers and tied up traffic when they rallied at the square
in front of the Heilongjiang provincial government Jan. 10, the
pro-Beijing Ta Kung Pao reported.
   The group returned to campus after presenting a petition to press
their demands, the report said.
   The incident that sent the students into the street occurred Jan.
8, when three ``scoundrels'' took a young woman against her will
from a dance hall, according to the report.
   The assailants became infuriated when she escaped and then
attacked ``without cause or reason'' university student Qiu Haidong,
slashing him seven times with a knife. He required 54 stitches on
his head and was hospitalized, Ta Kung Pao said.
   Two culprits were caught by police but a third escaped, the
newspaper said.
   Last June, about 2,000 students from Beijing University took to
the streets in a march to protest the death of a fellow student in a
brawl. Police monitored the march but did not interfere.
   Within days, Beijing University students planned a pro-democracy
march to the capital's Tiananmen Square but backed down when
hundreds of police sealed off the area.
   The Ta Kung Pao report did not say how authorities in Harbin,
about 665 miles from Beijing, responded to the petition offered by
the students.

   Underground Palestinian leaders said in a
leaflet circulated today they will escalate their rebellion despite
the army's tough new measures to quell the 13-month revolt.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, several firebombs exploded in
the Israeli-owned Bank Leumi, injuring several Arab employees but
doing little material damage, the army said. Arab reports said four
Palestinians were treated for burns or smoke inhalation after the
bombs ignited a blaze inside the bank.
   In its latest leaflet, the United National Leadership of the
Uprising criticized the United States for not backing Palestinian
demands for an independent state.
   ``The American position is still against us and against our
people and against our national rights,'' said the leaflet. ``We
call on the Americans for an official recognition of the Palestine
Liberation Organization as a representative of the Palestinians and
to recognize the right to return, self-determination and the
establishment of an independent state in Palestine.''
   It was the 33rd leaflet issued since the uprising began in
December 1987.
   Israeli newspapers reported today that new rules allowing
soldiers to shoot plastic and rubber bullets more freely at
Palestinian protesters have sparked controversy and confusion in the
army.
   Some senior officers have voiced concern in closed-door forums
that the measures could escalate tensions in the rebellion, in which
367 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed, the
mass-circulation Maariv daily reported.
   Because of the concern, Israeli Attorney General Yosef Harish has
agreed to review the policy with top legal advisers this week,
several Israeli dailies reported.
   Last week the army announced a new get-tough policy that includes
destroying homes of stone-throwers and firing plastic bullets at
fleeing assailants and protesters who build stone barricades in the
streets.
   Today's leaflet warned: ``The Zionist enemy imagines that with
their latest suppressive measures and by using all kinds of bullets,
they will succeed in crushing the intefadeh (uprising). We know such
measures will never stop an escalation of the intefadeh.''
   Plastic-tipped bullets were introduced last August because they
are not supposed to be as lethal as lead rounds if fired from at
least 70 yards away. But at least 40 deaths have been attributed to
the plastic ammunition, Israeli newspapers have reported.
   Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron was quoted today as saying of
new regulations: ``It is true you can fire, but only at those who
actually cause a danger and one of the dangers is roadblocks.''
   He told Israel radio: ``I assume these means will result in
diminishing the actions aimed against us and Israeli citizens in the
territories. Maybe at the first stage it will lead to tension but if
we see it in longer perspective, I assume it will eventually bring a
relaxation.''
   The Haaretz daily said troops last week were instructed not to
fire lead ammunition at protesters and to avoid shooting women and
children under 16.
   According to Haaretz, soldiers may fire plastic bullets during a
``violent disturbance,'' which the regulations define as
stone-throwing, erecting roadblocks or burning tires by three or
more protesters.

   Pleased with voters' approval of a
domed stadium, Mayor Henry Cisneros said he may seek re-election,
despite personal problems that prompted his original decision to
leave politics.
   However, Cisneros said Sunday he would not decide about entering
the May 2 election until he talks with former Mayor Lila Cockrell,
who already announced her candidacy.
   Cockrell is considered the front-runner in a race that has drawn
only one announced opponent, insurance businessman Carl Mauthe.
   Cisneros, a prominent Hispanic politician who twice was
considered for the Democratic vice presidential slot, said he will
review his options during a trip to Massachusetts this week.
   Last October, Cisneros, who is married, acknowledged that he had
a close, personal relationship with political fund-raiser Linda
Medlar, who also is married. The previous month, he said he would
abandon politics in order to spend more time with his young son,
John Paul, who has health problems.
   Cisneros answered questions about his political future during a
meeting with reporters in which he discussed the victory Saturday of
a sales tax increase for the $174 million Alamodome stadium.
   Cisneros, who has been mayor for eight years, had promoted the
stadium as a way to increase the city's tourism and convention
business.

   Clayton Jaques has no hands. His coaches
and teammates say he makes up for that with his heart.
   Jaques, 15, played softball last summer in a recreational league
and football last fall for Reed City High School. He's now playing
basketball for the school's freshman team and plans to go out for
track in the spring while maintaining an A average and a spot on the
Student Council.
   Because of birth defects, Jaques' left arm ends near the elbow
and his right arm ends just short of the wrist. His left foot has no
big toe and is smaller and narrower than his right foot.
   That means each sport, as well as routine activities like holding
a pencil and getting dressed, require special adjustments. But
Jaques and those close to him say there's a common thread running
through everything he does.
   ``He has something not everybody has _ a desire to do his best
and win,'' said Kevin Oxley, Jaques' basketball coach.
   ``He's just one of the guys,'' said Ty Weiss, a teammate. ``He
does everything just as well or better than we do. He's earned our
respect.
   ``In football, he was one of the best players on the team. You'd
have to respect him, or he'd tear you apart.''
   Jaques, 15, said he's been inspired by other handicapped athletes
such as Jim Abbott, the one-handed former pitcher for the University
of Michigan and U.S. Olympic team and a California Angels draftee.
   ``There's nobody around exactly like me, so there's really nobody
to teach me how to do a lot of these things. So I have to teach
myself,'' Jaques said.
   ``But when you want something bad enough, and you have had 15
years to practice, you can usually do it. Nothing should be able to
stop you.''
   Few things stopped Jaques when he played football last fall for
Reed City.
   ``Are there limits for him?'' asked football coach Kevin Lang.
``Logically, you'd say `yes.' But after I've seen some of the things
I've seen, I couldn't say what those limits are.''
   One of the things that amazed Lang most happened in practice when
he gave anyone who wanted a chance to play quarterback. Jaques got
in line.
   ``He threw three tight spirals 30 yards downfield for
receptions,'' said Lang. ``I don't know how he does it.''
   Jaques said he doesn't know either.
   ``I don't really know, but I just kind of learned how,'' he said.
``I guess it's just like people with hands. I just feel when it's
the right release point. It's the same thing with shooting a
basketball.''
   The teen-ager has prostheses, intended to operate as false hands,
but rarely uses them. The devices are like wearing ``snowmobile
boots in the summertime,'' he says.
   Jaques eventually became a two-way lineman before injuries to
teammates earned him an invitation to try out at running back.
   ``The first time he touched the ball, he went 85 yards for a
touchdown,'' Lang said. ``He averaged 14.7 yards per carry. He had
only one fumble, and that was in the first game. I thought that was
quite miraculous.''
   But Jaques said his success owes less to miracles than to
discipline and patience, both with himself and others.
   ``Others have to have confidence in you, too,'' he said. ``You
have to earn that confidence. But they have to be willing to believe
you can.''

<HEAD>Soviet Step Up Food Airlifts to Capital</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: New thruout with airlifts into Kabul, quotes from military commander,
reports of fighting. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet military today stepped up
food airlifts to Kabul to ease shortages it blamed on hoarding by
traders and inefficiency by the Afghan regime.
   Moslem guerrillas reported heavy fighting near the Soviet border
in northern Afghanistan and said they shot down three aircraft.
   The rebel-run Afghan News Agency claimed guerrillas on Saturday
attacked the city of Kunduz, 36 miles from the Soviet border.
Fighting has continued since, and ``a large number of soldiers were
killed at Kunduz airport area,'' the news agency said.
   According to the report, the downed aircraft included a
Soviet-built Mig-21 jet fighter.
   At the airport in Kabul, Soviet troops unloaded hundreds of sacks
of flour from giant Ilyushin 76 transport planes.
   ``The local authorities did not give out the orders in time for
when they needed to get food supplies,'' said Maj. Gen. Lev
Serebrov, a member of the Soviet military command in Kabul.
   ``And some of the traders are not selling in order to raise
prices,'' he said. ``There are enough supplies in the city and they
are keeping it to themselves.''
   Reporters were restricted to an area of the airport where the
Soviet transports landed. Behind a fence in the distance, about 30
Soviet troops waited with baggage and checked in their rifles,
apparently ready to leave.
   On Sunday, Serebrov denied the Soviets have renewed their pullout
from Afghanistan but said they still plan to be out of the country
by a Feb. 15 deadline. He also said the Red Army is leaving with a
sense of failure.
   ``We have not succeeded in everything we planned to do here,'' he
said. ``We came here with an honorable task, with open hearts ... We
are leaving and we have a sense of not having accomplished our
mission to the end.''
   But Serebrov said the Soviets' withdrawal after nine years in
Afghanistan compared favorably with the U.S. exit from Vietnam.
   ``Your generals ran away from Saigon,'' he told an American
reporter at a news briefing. ``But we have a withdrawal that is
proceeding according to a timetable.''
   ``We are ready ... to end the withdrawal by Feb. 15, but we have
not yet received the order to start the final stage of withdrawal,''
he added.
   Pressed about visual evidence of troops leaving, Serebrov,
speaking through an interpreter, said the departing troops had
merely completed their two-year military service and ``are being
replaced with new ones.''
   Heavy snowfall and growing rebel attacks on supply convoys on the
Salang highway from the Soviet border have been blamed for the food
shortages in the capital.
   The shortages have eased since the Soviets began the emergency
airlift Friday. Lines for bread, which previously began forming
early in the day and stretched for blocks, have shortened or
disappeared in some parts of the city.
   Serebrov, who invited Western reporters to the airport to see the
transports arriving, said 400 to 500 tons of flour were arriving
daily on 12 to 15 flights from the Soviet cities of Tashkent and
Fergana, both about an hour by plane from Kabul.
   During the two-hour visit to the airport, three transports landed
and one took off.
   Processions of military trucks crawled through the city, taking
flour to storaged depots controlled by the Soviet-backed government.
   Serebrov said the Soviet airlifts probably will continue until
the end of the week.
   The Islamic Unity of Afghan Mujahedeen, a rebel alliance group
based in Peshawar, Pakistan, also said today that it was sending
emergency food to Afghans in Kabul.
   A statement issued by the Afghan News Agency did not say when or
how much food would be sent.
   It remained unclear how long food supplies will last, or whether
the Soviets will be able to resume airlifts if necessary.
   About 50,000 Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan in August
under an agreement mediated by the United Nations to end the Soviet
military's nine-year intervention in the nation. The 50,000
remaining troops are to leave by Feb. 15.
   The guerrillas have been fighting the government since the
communists seized power in a coup in April 1978, and they are not a
party to the U.N. pact. They are expected to challenge the Afghan
regime once the Soviet pullout is completed.
   The Soviets announced late last year they had indefinitely
suspended the withdrawal of remaining troops because of continued
U.S. and Pakistani aid to the guerrillas.
   Western diplomats have said the withdrawal resumed early this
month.

   Ticket sales for the Spoleto Festival USA
are running well ahead of last year at this time and, for the first
time in five years, the festival is free of long-term debt,
officials say.
   Ticket sales for the performing arts festival, which begins May
26, are about $40,000 ahead of this time last year, general manager
Nigel Redden told the festival's executive committee Sunday.
   However, he said, the festival still has many holes in its 1989
line-up.
   ``The key issue is whether we have a play. The answer is (still)
no. ... We are in negotiations with a number of companies around the
world,'' he said.
   The festival has been paying its debts since it ran into
difficulty during the 1984-85 seasons, but ``we are now out of the
banks 100 percent,'' said Charles S. Way Jr., Spoleto board chairman.

   A six-story apartment house collapsed in
Cairo and killed at least 14 people, police said today.
   Rescuers were searching the debris for three missing people known
to have been in the building when it crumbled late Sunday night,
said officers speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The structure, built 60 years ago in the middle-class residential
district of Abbassiya, had one apartment on each floor.
   Police said 22 people were in the building when it collapsed.
   Rescuers pulled 14 bodies from the debris this morning. Five
injured survivors were hospitalized.
   Buildings periodically collapse in the Egyptian capital, mostly
because of age and poor maintenance. Such collapses killed 23 people
last August and September.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive
actress Vanessa Redgrave's lawsuit against the Boston Symphony
Orchestra for canceling her performances following threats by
protesters.
   The court, without comment, let stand a $39,500
breach-of-contract award won by Ms. Redgrave but barred any
additional damages based on claims that her civil and constitutional
rights were violated.
   Ms. Redgrave was hired by the symphony in 1982 to narrate six
performances of Stravinsky's opera-oratorio ``Oedipus Rex'' at
Boston, the orchestra's Tanglewood concerts in western Massachusetts
and New York's Carnegie Hall.
   The contract was canceled after the symphony received letters and
telephone calls from people threatening to picket and protest the
performances because of Ms. Redgrave's support for the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   After several rounds of state and federal court hearings, the 1st
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September ruled that Ms.
Redgrave's rights were not violated.
   The appeals court awarded her $12,000 as compensation for a part
in a Broadway production she said she lost because of the Boston
Symphony controversy. That amount was reduced from the $100,000 a
federal jury had awarded her.
   The appeals court also upheld the award of the $27,500 fee Ms.
Redgrave was to receive for the ``Oedipus Rex'' performances.
   The symphony successfully argued that it did not violate a
Massachusetts civil rights law protecting freedom of expression when
it canceled the contract.
   Lawyers for the symphony said it acted legitimately out of
concern that threatened disruptions would mar the artistic integrity
of the performances.
   In the appeal acted on today, Ms. Redgrave's lawyers said she was
the victim of ``blacklisting.''
   ``In a free society, people's livelihoods should not depend upon
their holding `correct' political views as defined either by their
government or by their employer,'' the appeal said.
   It added that the contract was canceled ``solely because (Ms.
Redgrave) had expressed ... a political view unpopular in some
circles, namely that the Palestinian people should have a homeland
of their own.''
   The appeal said the symphony was trying to hide behind a defense
of artistic integrity to shield itself from legal liability.
   The case is Redgrave vs. Boston Symphony, 88-912.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling that
Illinois prison officials violated the rights of inmates in
protective custody at the Stateville Correctional Center.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by state officials
that the protective-custody inmates were not entitled to the same
programs, services and living conditions as inmates in the general
prison population.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last July that the
unequal treatment afforded those in protective custody violated
constitutional rights.
   ``Bad prisons are not inevitable,'' the appeals court said in
rejecting arguments by officials that they were protecting security
at Stateville.
   The appeals court also ordered further trial hearings to
determine what damages the protective-custody inmates are owed.
   Illinois officials ``have failed to convince us that the cutback
of essential programs and services for protective-custody inmates at
Stateville has a legitimate rational basis,'' the appeals court said.
   It noted that the inmates were segregated from the general prison
population at the maximum-security institution to protect them, not
to punish them.
   The protective-custody inmates were not allowed to take part in
communal worship services or classroom religious instruction; their
access to the library was strictly limited; vocational and
educational programs designed to rehabilitate prisoners were not
available to them; they said their food was inferior and they had to
eat all meals in their cells; and they were allowed only 75 minutes
of dayroom or yard recreation every other day.
   The appeals court said those inmates suffered inferior treatment
because prison officials had no desire to make improvements.
   The 7th Circuit court also upheld the appointment of a special
master to oversee improvements ordered by a federal trial judge.
   Appointment of a master is appropriate because of the many
``instances of administrative recalcitrance,'' the appeals court
said.
   Officials from Kansas and Indiana joined in urging the justices
to throw out the 7th Circuit court ruling
   The case is Lane vs. Williams, 88-899.

   The 15-member Parliament of this tiny
European principality was dissolved today after a dispute between
the two conservative parties allied in a coalition since 1938.
   New elections tentatively were scheduled March 5, a year early
for this nation of 26,000 people.
   Regent Prince Hans Adam ordered the dissolution after the seven
legislators of the Progressive Citizens' Party walked out to protest
their coalition partners' refusal to start a parliamentary inquiry
into the role of the State Constitutional Court president.
   The eight deputies of the ``Fatherland's Union'' are opposed to
an inquiry to determine whether Erich Seeker, the nation's top
juror, abused his position in connection with a national referendum
that approved construction of a $25 million museum to house the
princely family's art treasures _ one of the world's most important
collections.
   Seeker already has been acquitted of charges he overruled a
majority of a five-man court to reject a local committee's request
for a second referendum. The committee claimed citizens were not
fully aware of costs and the environmental impact on the capital, a
village of less than 5,000 inhabitants.
   The museum project long has been abandoned.

   A dozen U.S. war veterans are returning
to Vietnam to build a rural health clinic ``to help the Vietnamese
and also help ourselves,'' members of the group said today.
   Ground-breaking for the project _ believed to be the first
reconstruction effort by U.S. veterans in Vietnam _ is scheduled
Jan. 31. The group, which includes carpenters, electricians and
architects, is to spend 10 weeks building an eight-room clinic in
the southern seacoast town of Vung Tau.
   ``It seemed like a way to heal the insanity of the war itself,''
said Ruben Robert Gomez of Santa Cruz, Calif. ``We'd like to see
American hands-on restoration in Vietnam and put it behind us.''
   Members of the Veterans-Vietnam Restoration Project, a small
California veterans group, say the clinic will meet an urgent need
for better medical care in rural Vietnam; help foster
U.S.-Vietnamese ties; and perhaps serve to alleviate individual
psychological and moral problems from the war.
   A psychiatrist who specializes in helping Vietnam war veterans
will accompany the group to evaluate effects of the effort on
participants.
   Gomez said the project cost of $60,000 to $100,000 and the supply
of medicine and equipment is being met by a number of private
organizations including Operation California, the Christopher
Reynolds Foundation and the U.S. Committee for Scientific
Cooperation with Vietnam.
   ``Everywhere I go people say: `Hey, great, good luck to you,'''
Gomez said in an interview, adding that more than 80 veterans had
applied to join the group.
   Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, in October
personally wrote the group, giving them permission to build the
clinic.
   Gordon Smith, 38, of Monterey, Calif., said Vietnamese officials
have expressed interest in the veterans carrying out other
small-scale reconstruction projects, including the rebuilding of a
fire-damaged orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly called Saigon,
and another health clinic in northern Vietnam.
   Smith said American veterans groups are limited in the kind of
aid they can provide given the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam. The
U.S. government can make exceptions on humanitarian grounds and has
allowed the group to spend up to $32,000 in Vietnam itself.
   ``A lot of us are returning to finish unfinished business,''
Smith said. ``We were dealing with destruction; now we want to do
something constructive. American veterans have gone back to Vietnam
as tourists or to talk about problems like the Missing in Action.
But we're going to work; we'll be covered with sweat.''
   Also today, Vietnam gave U.S. officials the remains of 23 people
it believes are those of U.S. soldiers killed in the Vietnam War,
said Ross Petzing, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok. He
said the remains were being flown to the U.S. Joint Casualty
Resolution Center in Hawaii aboard a U.S. Air Force plane.
   Over the past year, Vietnam has stepped up cooperation with
Washington to resolve the issue of MIAs. The United States says it
prevents normalization of ties with Hanoi.
   Currently, 2,383 Americans are listed as MIA in Indochina, with
1,747 in Vietnam.

<HEAD>Texas Sports Investigations Stay Confidential, Court Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case sparked by a
football recruiting scandal at Southern Methodist University, today
refused to let news organizations see confidential investigation
files on SMU and other Texas schools.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that files
compiled by the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the
Southwest Athletic Conference do not have to be made public under
the Texas Open Records Act.
   In the wake of the SMU scandal that resulted in NCAA sanctions
against the Dallas school, some Texas news organizations sought
disclosure of investigation files compiled by the association.
   They also sought files compiled by the nine-member Southwest
Conference, which in addition to SMU has three other public Texas
universities as members.
   When the requests were denied, the news organizations sued,
invoking the 1973 state law that requires ``governmental bodies''
receiving ``public funds'' generally to make public their internal
documents.
   A federal trial judge ruled that the state law applies to the
NCAA and the Southwest Conference, and ordered that the sought-after
documents be surrendered so it could be determined which should be
made public.
   But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling
last July 26.
   The appeals court agreed that the NCAA and the Southwest
Conference receive Texas public funds. But it said they are not
governmental bodies, defined in the state law as those entities
``supported in whole or in part by public funds.''
   The NCAA and the conference provide specific, measurable services
in return for the Texas tax money they receive, and therefore are
not supported by that money, the 5th Circuit court concluded.
   The news organizations then sought the Supreme Court's help.
   They argued that the appeals court wrongly reversed the trial
judge's factual rulings without finding that those rulings were
``clearly erroneous.''
   The appeal acted on today also argued that the appeals court
failed to follow controlling Texas law that athletic associations
receiving money from public Texas universities and colleges for
their general support are subject to the Open Records Act.
   The appeal was supported in a ``friend-of-the-court'' brief
submitted by state Attorney General Jim Mattox and his staff.
   Noting that a 1987 attorney general's opinion on the Open Records
Act was ignored by the appeals court, Mattox said, ``Absent contrary
state law, the 5th Circuit (court) must follow applicable attorney
general Open Records decisions.''
   The case is Kneeland vs. NCAA, 88-884.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to kill a
$150,000 libel lawsuit against a Waco, Texas, newspaper by a justice
of the peace wrongly identified in a news article as a convicted
thief.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that force the
Waco Tribune-Herald to defend itself at trial against John B.
Guinn's suit.
   In the paper's Jan. 24, 1984 edition, a Tribune-Herald story
about various federal court actions reported that John B. Guinn of
Copperas Cove ``was given a five-year probated sentence and ordered
to pay restitution for theft on a government reservation.''
   In fact, Guinn had served as the lawyer for the man sentenced.
   In addition to his law practice, Guinn is an elected justice of
the peace in Coryell County. Guinn's hometown of Copperas Cover is
about 100 miles from Waco.
   When the newspaper discovered its mistake, a retraction was
printed promptly. But Guinn sued nevertheless, seeking $50,000 in
compensatory damages and $100,000 in punitive damages.
   A state trial judge threw out the suit before it reached a jury,
ruling that Guinn failed to show that the mistake had been made with
``actual malice.''
   Public officials and public figures who sue for libel must prove
that the sued-over statement was false and was made with actual
malice _ knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity.
   All other people who sue for libel must show only that the
statement was false and was made negligently, an easier burden of
proof.
   A state appeals court reversed the trial judge's dismissal of the
case. The appeals court said Guinn should not have been considered a
public official for the purposes of his suit against the newspaper.
   ``The newspaper item did not refer to Guinn in his official
capacity. Furthermore, the content of the article did not expressly
relate to Guinn's official conduct as a justice of the peace, nor
was it concerned with Guinn's performance of his official duties,''
the appeals court said.
   It added that the newspaper's lawyers offered no evidence to show
that Guinn was known as a public official ``beyond the confines of
his region.''
   The Texas Supreme Court refused to hear the Tribune-Herald's
ensuing appeal last Jan. 6.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Cox Enterprises,
publisher of the newspaper, argued that the Texas appeals court
ruling ``allows any local official to maintain a libel suit, despite
the lack of malice on the part of the publisher, simply if the
article fails to identify his political office.''
   In response, lawyers for Guinn said that ruling against him
``would serve to destroy a public official's right to protect his
private reputation from unjustified invasion and irreparable
damage.''
   The case is Cox Enterprises vs. Guinn, 88-631.

<HEAD>Court Clears Way for Trial in Los Angeles Times Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to postpone a
trial for a $3 million invasion-of-privacy lawsuit against the Los
Angeles Times.
   The justices, rejecting the newspaper's emergency request,
cleared the way for trial to begin Feb. 17 in San Diego.
   The controversy began when the Times reported the July 13, 1981,
murder in San Diego of Rose Rende.
   The article reported correctly that the victim's roommate,
identified in court documents only by the fictitious name Jane Doe,
discovered Ms. Rende's body in their apartment.
   The Times article also mentioned that ``one witness'' who was not
identified had seen a suspect fleeing from the apartment and had
described him for police.
   The lawsuit against the Times contends that the murder suspect,
who knew that the person who discovered the body was the person who
saw him, could have learned of the roommate's identity by reading
the newspaper article.
   The suspect has never been caught, but court records show that no
one ever has contacted Jane Doe or threatened her as a result of the
article.
   The reporter who wrote the article did not know that the suspect
had seen Jane Doe, and testified in pretrial proceedings that she
learned of Jane Doe's identity from the county coroner's office.
   The newspaper sought to have the suit, which accused it of making
Jane Doe a ``walking target,'' thrown out before it reached a jury.
   A California appeals court ruled against the paper. It said a
jury should decide whether publication of Jane Doe's real name was
newsworthy.
   The California Supreme Court refused to hear the newspaper's
ensuing appeal.
   The nation's highest court last June rejected an emergency
request by the Times Mirror Co., the Times' publisher, aimed at
postponing any trial until a still-pending formal appeal is acted on.
   In asking Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to postpone the trial,
lawyers for the Times noted that the formal appeal argues that the
Constitution's First Amendment shields it and its reporter from
facing potential liability ``for routine, lawful news gathering and
reporting about a current crime.''
   The emergency request added, ``Without a stay, that central issue
cannot be addressed because the trial will go forward.''
   O'Connor referred the request to the full court.
   The case is Times Mirror Co. vs. Doe, A-568.

<TEXT>
   British Airways acknowledged a security lapse after
a passenger's luggage was put on the wrong flight last week and said
the airline had acted to prevent it from happening again.
   A key part of airline security is the rule that baggage should
not be loaded unless the owner is traveling on the same plane. The
regulation is believed to reduce greatly the chances of bombs in
airliner baggage holds.
   A passenger traveling from Brussels, Belgium, to London on
Wednesday alerted the airline that his luggage had been loaded on an
earlier flight.
   A British Airways spokeswoman said Sunday the incident had been
verified.
   ``It was a lapse in security and clearly should not have
happened. We have taken the necessary action aimed at making sure
that it doesn't happen again,'' said the spokeswoman, speaking on
condition of anonymity in keeping with British practice.
   ``As this is a security matter we are not giving details of what
action we have taken,'' she said.
   Airline security has been an especially sensitive subject since
the Dec. 21 bombing of a Pan Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
which killed 270 people.
   Investigators still are trying to determine how the explosives
were planted on board Flight 103, which was flying from Frankfurt to
New York via London.

<HEAD>Court Will Review Wyoming Water-Rights Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to review a
12-year dispute over water rights in Wyoming's Big Horn River basin.
   The justices said they will study a Wyoming Supreme Court
decision last year that gave a partial victory to Shoshone and
Northern Arapahoe Indians living on the Wind River Indian
Reservation.
   Today's action was taken on an appeal filed by Wyoming. The
justices took no action on related appeals filed by the Indian
tribes and the city of Riverton.
   The state court, by a 3-2 vote, had said Wyoming's admission into
the United States in 1890 did not supplant the water rights Congress
previously had attached to the reservation.
   ``A reserved water right is implied for an Indian reservation
where water is necessary to fulfill the purposes of the
reservation,'' the state court said.
   But it added that the reserved water rights for the Wind River
Reservation were only for agricultural purposes.
   Wyoming officials sued the federal government and the Indian
tribes in 1977, contending that Congress in 1905 intended that the
reservation's future water rights be obtained under Wyoming law.
   The state Supreme Court rejected the state's arguments on that
point, sparking the appeal by Wyoming acted on today. But the state
court also ruled that the amount of water appropriated for the
tribes' use be based only on irrigation needs.
   In a cross appeal acted on today, the Northern Arapahoe and
Shoshone tribes challenged that portion of the state court's ruling.
   The Wyoming appeal was supported in a ``friend-of-the-court''
brief submitted by officials from six other Western states _
Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota and
Washington.
   The case is Wyoming vs. U.S., 88-309.

<HEAD>Texas Group Loses Challenge to Pope Stamp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group supporting the separation of church and
state today lost a Supreme Court challenge to a cancellation stamp
that commemorated a 1987 visit to the United States by Pope John
Paul II.
   The court, without comment, refused to revive a lawsuit by the
Texas-based Society of Separationists against the Postal Service.
   The group's leader, Ralph B. Shirley of Austin, Texas, said the
stamp improperly used taxpayer money to promote religion.
   At the request of a customer, post offices in the nine cities the
pope visited in 1987 would use a special rubber stamp bearing the
emblem of the Vatican in Rome to cancel postcards and first-class
letters.
   The cancellation stamps were used only during the pope's visit.
   Shirley said, ``The purpose of the Postal Service in
commemorating the visit of the pope is clearly religious. The pope's
visit is in no way a secular event.''
   A federal judge threw out the suit, and the dimisssal was upheld
last July by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court said the case is moot _ no longer posing a live
controversy _ since the stamps were discontinued. Generally, courts
do not consider cases without live issues.
   Since the case is moot, a court would take it up only if the
Society of Separationists can show that the Postal Service could
repeat the action in a way that would evade review by the courts,
the appeals court said.
   It said the group has ``not established a demonstrated
probability or a reasonable expectation that the current pope or his
successor will visit the U.S. and that the Postal Service will
commemorate the event with special cancellations.''
   Shirley said the appeals court ignored the reality of what
happened during previous papal visits to the United States.
   Similar cancellation stamps were used to honor Pope John Paul II
in 1979, 1981 and twice in 1984, Shirley said.
   The Postal Service limits the time that the stamps can be
challenged in court by waiting until he is about to arrive before
announcing the stamps, Shirley said.
   ``This is a sly trick of the Postal Service to attempt to block
review of its unlawful acts'' by the courts, added the group's
appeal acted on today.
   The case is Shirely vs. Schraer, 88-712.

   The Supreme Court today refused to shield New
York from possibly paying part of the $702,000 award won by the
family of a man who died 26 years ago in a secret Army chemical
warfare experiment.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that New York may
be sued by federal officials seeking to force the state to help pay
the award.
   Harold Blauer was given injections of mescaline derivatives while
being treated at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New
York City for depression following a divorce.
   Blauer, 42, a teaching tennis professional at country clubs, was
not aware what the drugs were.
   The Army revealed in 1975 that it had supplied the mescaline as
part of a chemical warfare experiment.
   According to court records, Blauer was recovering from depression
and would soon be released from the hospital when he received the
injections. After the fifth and final injection on Jan. 8, 1953, he
began sweating profusely, flailing his arms. His body stiffened and
he frothed at the mouth. He went into a coma and died in two hours.
   No mention was made of the Army experiment in the medical
examiner's report, which said the drugs had been used for diagnostic
purposes.
   Blauer's former wife, Amy, was paid $18,000 in 1955 to settle her
negligence suit against the state.
   After the federal government revealed the Army experiment in 1975
during a congressional investigation of another matter, Blauer's
daughter, Elizabeth Barrett, sued the federal and state governments.
   A federal judge dismissed the charges against New York on grounds
that the Constitution's 11th Amendment shields states against such
lawsuits.
   The 11th Amendment gives states immunity from lawsuits in federal
court by private citizens.
   U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley ruled in 1987 that the
federal government must pay $702,000 to the Blauer family for using
the victim as ``a guinea pig in an experiment.''
   ``The primary reason the Army covered up its involvement (for 22
years) was to avoid embarrassment and adverse publicity,'' the judge
said.
   The federal government then was allowed to sue New York officials
to try to force the state to contribute to the damage award.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last August that
neither the 11th Amendment nor any state law shields New York from
being sued in such a case by the federal government.
   The case is New York vs. U.S., 88-745.

   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
libel lawsuit against the publisher of Us magazine by the daughter
of a New York doctor who murdered his wife with a drug injection.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that Esther
Friedgood failed to show that the allegedly libelous statements
about her were published with ``actual malice.''
   Her appeal argued that lower courts wrongly treated her as a
``public figure'' in the case.
   Dr. Charles Friedgood and his wife, Sophie, lived in Kensington,
Long Island, when Mrs. Friedgood died in 1975.
   Friedgood signed his wife's death certificate, stating that the
cause of death was stroke but a suspicious prosecutor ordered an
autopsy. It was determined that Mrs. Friedgood had been injected
with a deadly dose of Demerol, a painkiller.
   The newspaper Newsday published a series of articles detailing
the death. In 1980, reporter Leonard Levitt published a book about
the case.
   A review of the Levitt's book in Us magazine said Esther
Friedgood was an after-the-crime accomplice because she hid evidence
of the crime after her father confided in her.
   Ms. Friedgood had not known about her father's role in her
mother's death when she agreed to hide some bottles and a syringe.
She later cooperated with prosecutors, and testified against her
father.
   The appeal acted on today said Ms. Friedgood should have been
considered a private citizen rather than a public figure for
purposes of her lawsuit against Peters Publishing Co., which
publishes Us.
   Private citizens who sue for libel must prove the sued-over
statement was false, harmful and made negligently.
   Public figures and public officials who sue for libel face the
tougher task of proving the sued-over statement was false, harmful
and made with actual malice _ knowledge or reckless disregard of its
falsity.
   Ms. Friedgood, a lawyer in West Palm Beach, Fla., never wanted to
be a newsmaker in connection with her father's crime and therefore
should not have been considered a public figure, her appeal said.
   But even if she had been a public figure at the time of her
father's prosecution, the appeal said, she was no longer when the
book review was published.
   In a 1979 decision that limited the legal definition of public
figures, the justices left unresolved ``whether or when an
individual who was once a public figure may lose that status by the
passage of time.''
   A Florida state judge who dismissed Ms. Friedgood's suit said she
had not lost public-figure status. A state appeals court upheld that
ruling, and the Florida Supreme Court refused to review the case
last Aug. 29.
   The appeals court, noting that only a few years separated the
doctor's murder trial and the book review, said, ``It would seem
reasonable ... to conclude that public discussion about the case may
continue. Accordingly ... (Ms. Friedgood) should be deemed a limited
public figure for purposes of the comment about her in the book
review.''
   The appeals court then found that she had failed to present
evidence of actual malice.
   The case is Friedgood vs. Peters Publishing Co., 88-863.

<TEXT>
   Armed civilians took over a small
military base near the capital today after a gun battle with
soldiers that left five people dead, and troops were fighting to
retake the base, an official news report said.
   Troops and civilian commandos backed by tanks broke back into the
base a few hours after the seizure and opened fire from two small
tanks at the officers' club, in which the commandos were thought to
be holed up, the state news agency Telam reported. There were no
immediate reports of casualties in the counterattack.
   The Ministry of Defense, anticipating a possible fourth
insurrection against the government in the past 21 months, bolstered
defenses at Government House and the official residence of President
Raul Alfonsin, Telam said.
   The civilian president spoke by telephone with Defense Minister
Horacio Jaunarena and Army Chief Gen. Francisco Gassino and told
them to retake the base, presidential press secretary Jose Ignacio
Lopez told reporters.
   Buenos Aires provincial police surrounded the base, began to
evacuate nearby residents, and took up firing positions in private
homes.
   The attackers carried pamphlets in support of officers who have
led previous uprisings, the independent DyN news agency, said. The
incident comes less than two months after a short-lived barracks
insurrection to protest Alfonsin's treatment of the military.
   ``A report arrived that indicates the people (civilians) have
taken over the regiment and are taking up positions with heavy
arms,'' a town official in La Matanza, which encompasses the 3rd
Infantry Regiment at La Tablada, was quoted as telling Telam.
   La Tablada is 12 miles northwest of the capital, Buenos Aires.
   ``Soldiers, police and civilians are wounded,'' it said. Three
civilians and two police were killed, Telam later reported.
   Defense Ministry officials made no statement on the attack, and
the precise number of the civilians involved or soldiers at the base
was not known.
   The attack began at about 3 a.m., when civilians threw several
small explosive devices onto the base compound, DyN reported.
   Employees at a nearby gas station said that at about 6:15 a.m.,
civilians in a truck crashed through the regiment's main gate, DyN
said. Six cars followed.
   A total of 40 to 50 men and women dressed in civilian clothes
were in the truck and cars, both news agencies reported. Police put
the number at about 30.
   As they entered the base, the civilians threw pamphlets in
support of what is known as the ``New Argentine Army'' of dismissed
and imprisoned Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, who led short-lived army
uprisings in April 1987 and January 1988, according to DyN. Rico has
been dismissed and is now in prison.
   Other pamphlets read ``Long Live Rico!'' and ``Long Live
Seineldin!'' DyN reported. Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin a four-day
uprising in December. He is also in prison.
   By late morning, gunfire still was being heard from the base.
   The base was almost empty at the time of the attack, the news
agencies reported. They said most officers and non-commissioned men
had left for the weekend and had not returned.
   The December insurrection began after officers at several army
bases, including La Tablada, tried to incite troops. Seineldin
surrendered four days later.
   The only clashes reported during that insurrection were between
troops and civilians, many of whom harbor animosity toward the
military.
   On Friday, President Alfonsin told a news conference that
factions within the army still are angry over issues such as the
prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the
1976-83 military dictatorship, which he was elected in 1983 to
replace.
   ``I affirm categorically that those factions are not going to
have the possibilities to triumph,'' Alfonsin said. ``But I should
say with absolute seriousness that I am not in the position of
assuring with the same force and certainty that there will not be
other episodes.''

   To the 48 Polish sailors who jumped ship in Boston
Harbor during the past month, it was a choice between freedom and
oppression.
   But the merchant seamen's fate depends on whether U.S. officials
believe they are freedom-seekers or decide they are fortune hunters
willing to abandon their homes and families for a chance at economic
opportunity.
   The unusually large wave of defections prompted a visit to Boston
from Polish consular officials, who invited any defectors having
second thoughts to return home without fear of repercussion.
   But the sailors rebuffed the overtures, saying they don't believe
the promises would be kept.
   ``That's what we ran away from and we didn't want to have
anything to do with those Polish officials,'' said Vieslaw, a sailor
who spoke on condition that only his first name be used.
   ``It's this classic case of propaganda, and there's no doubt in
my mind that on return to Poland we would be incarcerated,'' said
Marek, who also declined to give his last name. Both spoke through
an interpreter.
   The sailors said they were reluctant to be fully identified
because they feared harassment.
   Marek Kaminski, one of the consular officials visiting from New
York last week, portrayed the sailors as adventure seekers who would
eventually regret their decision.
   The Polish officials also denied reports that the sailors'
families would be fined or their wives would be fired from their
jobs.
   But Wendy Lauser, program coordinator of the Polish Social
Cultural Association, said some of the sailors who contacted
relatives in Poland have been told their wives have been asked to
appear at special interviews at work.
   None of the sailors met with the consular officials, said Jack
Kowalski, Mayor Raymond Flynn's liaison to Boston's substantial
Polish-American community.
   Kowalski said he believed the Polish officials were trying to
gather information about Boston's Polish community. Last January,
Kowalski worked with a group of 13 sailors who defected. The 13 were
granted asylum in April.
   Timothy Whelan, deputy director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Boston, said it was possible the Polish
government's overtures could have a bearing on the sailors' cases.
   Whelan said the State Department would issue an advisory ruling
on the sailors' cases that would take into consideration Poland's
political climate, as well as the lengths the sailors had to go to
to leave their homeland.
   Officials said they couldn't explain the unusually large wave of
defections. The sailors fled from three fishing vessels visiting
Boston Harbor since late December. The latest group, 16 crewmen,
defected Jan. 5.
   They are seeking political asylum.
   ``For some of them it was a decision they made a long time ago.
For some of them it was a decision they made on the ship,'' said
Lauser, who emigrated from Poland eight years ago after marrying an
American. She said the decision to leave is often prompted by living
in a system ``which promises you a lot all the time and you reach
the age and you see no changes _ just words.''
   Marek said he thought a long time before jumping ship.
   ``We were awfully afraid, especially at first about our
decision,'' he said. ``I lamented over the decision for two weeks,
especially about my wife and child.''
   The two sailors said the reforms outlined by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev haven't reached Poland.
   ``What Gorbachev is doing in Russia is good and noble, but it's
too early to really examine the long-term effects,'' he said.
   The two sailors, who have found jobs in the Boston area, said
they have been busy settling in to their new surroundings.
   ``We feel terrific about being here so far,'' said Vieslaw.
   ``We feel good because we have shelter, we have food, the basic
staples have been provided for,'' Marek said.
   Polish-American families offered rooms to the sailors, but now
many of them have been able to move into apartments, Lauser said.
She said all the sailors were issued temporary work permits by the
INS while they filed for political asylum.
   Cathryn MacInnes, a consultant to Boston's city government on
immigration matters, is working on the applications, which basically
hinge on whether the sailors would face persecution if they returned
to Poland.

   A museum devoted to the work of
surrealist painter Salvador Dali may hold a memorial service
Wednesday that would coincide with the artist's funeral in Spain,
the museum's curator said today.
   Dali, 84, died today in Fugueras, Spain.
   ``We haven't decided exactly what we will do,'' said Joan Kropf
at the Salvador Dali Museum, which opened on Florida's Gulf Coast in
1982. ``We are working on details.''
   The museum was founded on a collection built by A. Reynolds
Morse, a friend of the Spanish painter for nearly 45 years. Morse
was busy packing for a flight to Spain today to pay his last
respects, Ms. Kropf said.
   ``The collection here is because of Mr. Morse's belief that Dali
was one of the greatest 20th century artists,'' she said.
   ``It's very difficult for us to make a formal statement,'' Morse
said in a statement released by the museum. ``What can we say? He is
the greatest artist of the 20th century.''
   The museum's collection includes 93 oils, 55 of them on display;
nearly 150 drawings; 2,000 graphics and lithographs; and extensive
archives and a library.

<HEAD>Court Rules Police Don't Need Warrants for Helicopter Searches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that police do
not need court warrants before searching from helicopters for
marijuana growing in fenced-in yards.
   The court, by a 5-4 vote, said sheriff's deputies in Pasco
County, Fla., did not violate anyone's privacy rights five years ago
when searching for marijuana from a helicopter hovering 400 feet
above the ground.
   Justice Byron R. White, in the court's main opinion, said the
helicopter was in air space where it legally may fly.
   ``The helicopter in this case was not violating the law,'' White
said, and helicopters flying at 400 feet are common enough
occurrences to make the police conduct reasonable.
   The high court in 1986 ruled, 5-4, that a warrantless search by
Santa Clara, Calif., police in an airplane flying at a lawful
altitude of 1,000 feet had not violated privacy rights.
   In the Florida case, Pasco County deputies received an anonymous
tip that Michael A. Riley was growing marijuana in his yard.
   Unable to tell what plants were growing in a greenhouse located
in the yard, the deputies flew over in a helicopter. From there,
they could look into the missing panels of the greenhouse roof.
   Based on what they saw, the deputies obtained a search warrant
and entered Riley's yard, seizing 44 marijuana plants.
   Riley challenged the helicopter search, seeking to block
prosecutors from using the seized plants as evidence against him.
   The Constitution's Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable
police searches, and generally requires police to persuade a court
that reasonable suspicion of criminal activity exists before they
can search private property.
   The Florida Supreme Court ruled for Riley, saying the search
violated Riley's reasonable expectation of privacy. The state court
noted that fixed-wing planes are not allowed to fly at altitudes
lower than 500 feet.
   Today's decision reversed the state court ruling.
   ``This is not to say that an inspection of the curtilage (yard)
of a house from an aircraft will always pass muster under the Fourth
Amendment simply because the plane is within the navigable airspace
specified by law,'' White said. But his opinion did not spell out
any limits for such searches.
   White was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor also voted to uphold the Florida
search but wrote a separate, concurring opinion.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens
and Harry A. Blackmun dissented.
   Brennan, in an opinion joined by Marshall and Stevens, noted that
the passage in George Orwell's novel 1984 in which the caption ``Big
Brother is Watching You'' includes this: ``In the far distance a
helicopter skimmed down between the roofs ... It was the Police
Patrol, snooping into people's windows.''
   In his opinion, Brennan asked, ``Who can read this passage
without a shudder, and without the instinctive reaction that it
depicts life in some country other than ours?''
   The case is Florida vs. Riley, 87-764.

   Police detained more than 400
people near the grave of a student who burned himself to death 20
years ago to protest the Soviet-led invasion that crushed ``Prague
Spring'' reforms, activists said.
   The police action capped Czechoslovakia's most serious week of
political unrest since Jan Palach set himself ablaze in central
Wenceslas Square in January 1969 and thousands of people took to the
streets in shock and grief.
   Former Communist Party chief Alexander Dubcek was quoted Sunday
as saying the young people now demonstrating against Communist
authorities are frustrated by a political and economic system that
offers them no future.
   Activist Petr Uhl said more than 400 protesters were arrested on
Saturday in the village of Vsetaty, Palach's hometown 18 miles from
Prague. He said they had tried to hold a vigil at the heavily
guarded cemetery where Palach is buried. Police had blocked roads
and interrogated visitors on Saturday in an apparent attempt to
thwart a large demonstration.
   The arrests brought to 800 the number of people detained during
the week of protests, most of which occurred in Wenceslas Square,
where Palach set himself afire on Jan. 16, 1969.
   In Warsaw, Poland, police detained two members of the banned
Polish Socialist Party during a demonstration today in support of
the Czechoslovak dissidents detained, an opposition spokeswoman said.
   Several dozen people gathered in front of the Czechoslovak
Embassy and shouted ``We are with the Czechs! The Czechs are with
us!'' and ``Democracy in the whole bloc!'' said spokeswoman Zuzanna
Dabrowska.
   She said Socialist Party members Piotr Ikonowicz and Cezary
Mirzejewski were detained.
   The police presence was heavy in Prague and Vsetaty on Sunday and
no protests were reported.
   Uhl, a member of the Charter 77 human rights group, said police
on Saturday detained people who could not prove they were Vsetaty
residents. He said most were taken to a nearby state farm,
questioned, photographed and released.
   Two activists, Ludvik Marks of the independent youth group Czech
Children and Martin Litomirsky of the Democratic Initiative, were
apparently detained overnight, Uhl said.
   The protests signal a growing frustration with the lack of social
and economic reforms similiar to those implemented by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Soviet Union, said Dubcek, who was
ousted as his country's leader for supporting the reforms that
Soviet troops crushed in 1968.
   Dubcek, who lives in Bratislava, spoke about the current unrest
in Czechoslovakia in a telephone interview with the Italian
Communist Party daily l'Unita, which carried a front-page story on
Sunday.
   ``There is a basic crisis that involves, above all, the young
people, the 20-year-old children of the Prague Spring ... who have
no future,'' he was quoted as saying.
   ``What young people are asking for is a rebirth of the type under
way in the Soviet Union, that involves even the party,'' Dubcek said.
   Protest began Jan. 15 when about 5,000 activists tried to hold a
vigil for Palach in Wenceslas Square. Police broke up the gathering
with tear gas and truncheons and arrested 117 people.
   On Jan. 16, banned playwright Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's
best-known dissident, and 12 other activists were detained after
trying to lay flowers in memory of Palach.
   They were still in jailon Sunday, and fellow activists say it
appears they will face charges that could jail them for up to two or
three years.
   The youth newspaper Mlada Fronta said Saturday that 280 people
were detained Thursday during the week's worst violence, when riot
police charged a crowd of more than 2,000 and beat several people in
Prague.

   The Supreme Court, dealing a serious blow to
some forms of affirmative action, today struck down a Richmond, Va.,
program aimed at helping construction industry businesses owned by
minorities.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court ruled the plan is an unlawful form of
reverse discrimination.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said, ``Under
Richmond's scheme, a successful black, Hispanic or Oriental
entrepreneur from anywhere in the country enjoys an absolute
preference over other citizens based solely on their race.''
   ``We think it obvious that such a program is not narrowly
tailored to remedy the effects of prior discrimination,'' she said.
   The Richmond plan would require the prime contractor on any city
building contract to subcontract at least 30 percent of the value of
the project to firms that are at least one-half minority owned.
   O'Connor said, ``The 30 percent quota cannot be said to be
narrowly tailored to any goal, except perhaps outright racial
balancing. It rests upon the completely unrealistic assumption that
minorities will choose a particular trade in lockstep proportion to
their representation in the local population.''
   The ruling is expected to have far-reaching impact on the use of
so-called set-aside programs by states and cities.
   Most states and more than 190 local governments have such
programs, according to a study by the Minority Business Enterprise
Legal Defense Education Fund.
   The high court in recent years has upheld key affirmative action
programs in other areas, although always by narrow margins and with
no clear consensus on how to evaluate their lawfulness.
   In a stinging dissent today, Justice Thurgood Marshall said the
Richmond ruling ``marks a deliberate and giant step backward in this
court's affirmative action jurisprudence. Cynical of one
municipality's attempt to redress the effects of past racial
discrimination in a particular industry, the majority launches a
grapeshot attack on race-conscious remedies in general.''
   Marshall said the ``harsh reality'' of today's ruling will be to
discourage or prevent cities and states from ``acting to rectify the
scourge of past discrimination.''
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Harry A.
Blackmun.
   O'Connor drew a distinction between Richmond's plan and one
enacted by Congress that the court upheld in 1980. The congressional
plan required 10 percent of federal public works contracts be
earmarked for minority-controlled businesses.
   O'Connor said Richmond officials are not entitled to rely on a
finding by Congress that there has been nationwide discrimination in
the construction industry.
   Also, O'Connor said, the congressional set-aside excused local
governments from complying under certain conditions.
   Finally, she said, Congress has unique powers ``in making a
finding that past discrimination would cause federal funds to be
distributed in a manner which reinforced prior pattenrs of
discrimination.''
   ``While the states and their subdivisions may take remedial
action when they possess evidence that their own spending practices
are exacerbating a pattern of prior discrimination, they must
identify that discrimination, public or private, with some
specificity before they may use race-conscious relief,'' she said.
   The Richmond plan was challenged by building contractor J.A.
Croson Co. after it lost a city contract to install stainless steel
urinals and water closets at the city jail. Croson did not include a
minority-owned business as a subcontractor.
   Richmond officials adopted the affirmative action plan in 1983.
While the minorities named in the plan included Hispanics,
Orientals, Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts, the primary beneficiary
would have been blacks.
   Richmond's population is about half black. But the city's
minority-owned businesses historically received less than 1 percent
of the value of the city's public building contracts.
   Today's ruling upheld a decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals based in Richmond.
   A coalition of groups representing local and state governments
had said striking down the Richmond plan would reopen old wounds and
discourage affirmative action if it means governments first must
admit past discrimination before adopting remedial programs.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Ruled that police do not need court warrants before searching
from helicopters for marijuana growing in fenced-in yards.
   The court, by a 5-4 vote, said sheriff's deputies in Pasco
County, Fla., did not violate anyone's privacy rights five years ago
when searching for marijuana from a helicopter hovering 400 feet
above the ground.
   _ Ruled, in a case stemming from the 1982 war over the Falkland
Islands, that Argentina may not be sued in U.S. courts for attacking
a neutral oil tanker.
   The 9-0 decision killed a suit against Argentine officials by a
foreign corporation engaged in U.S. trade. The former Reagan
administration urged the justices to throw out the suit.
   _ Refused to let a financially troubled utility company increase
electric rates to help pay for a controversial nuclear power plant
in Seabrook, N.H.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``properly presented federal
question,'' left intact a New Hampshire law barring rate hikes to
pay for nuclear plant construction before the facilities are
completed.
   _ Refused to shield New York from possibly paying part of the
$702,000 award won by the family of a man who died 26 years ago in a
secret Army chemical warfare experiment.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that New York may
be sued by federal officials seeking to force the state to help pay
the award.
   _ Rejected an effort to preserve longshoremen's jobs in the face
of changing technology.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that labor
agreements between the International Longshoremen's Association and
shipping companies softening the impact of ``containerization'' at
Gulf and Atlantic coast ports violate federal shipping law.
   _ Refused to hear an appeal by a pest control company ordered to
roll back a fee increase it charged to more than 200,000 customers
nationwide.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that Orkin
Exterminating Co. acted in good faith in hiking renewal fees to
produce more than $7.5 million in extra revenue.
   _ Refused to revive actress Vanessa Redgrave's lawsuit against
the Boston Symphony Orchestra for canceling her performances
following threats by protesters.
   The court, without comment, let stand a $39,500
breach-of-contract award won by Ms. Redgrave but barred any
additional damages based on claims that her civil and constitutional
rights were violated.
   The affirmative action case is Richmond vs. Croson, 87-998.

   The Supreme Court, in a case stemming from the
1982 war over the Falkland Islands, ruled today that Argentina may
not be sued in U.S. courts for attacking a neutral oil tanker.
   The 9-0 decision killed a suit against Argentine officials by a
foreign corporation engaged in U.S. trade. The former Reagan
administration had urged the justices to throw out the suit.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
Argentina enjoys immunity from suit under a 1976 federal law, the
Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act.
   Nothing in the law permits a ship owner to sue over an ``injury
... on the high seas some 5,000 miles off the nearest shores of the
United States,'' Rehnquist said.
   He also rejected arguments that treaties between Argentina and
the United States created an exception to the broad immunity granted
by the 1976 law.
   The case stems from an attack on the oil tanker Hercules by
Argentine aircraft on June 8, 1982. The ship was 600 miles from the
Argentina coast and nearly 500 miles from the Falklands.
   Argentina and Great Britain were at war over control of the
islands, which Argentina calls the Malvinas.
   The Hercules was owned by United Carriers Inc. and chartered by
Amerada Hess Shipping Corp. to carry oil from Alaska around the
southern tip of South America to a refinery in the U.S. Virgin
Islands.
   United Carriers and Amerada Hess are both Liberian corporations.
   The Hercules was attacked despite a U.S. alert to Great Britain
and Argentina that it was among neutral vessels traveling in the
South Atlantic.
   The badly damaged tanker made it to port in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. But officials scuttled the ship on July 20, 1982, because an
unexploded bomb was embedded in one of its tanks.
   United Carriers sued Argentina for $10 million for the destroyed
tanker and Amerada Hess said it lost $2 million in fuel.
   The suit was filed in federal court in New York City after
Argentine officials refused to consider the claims and the companies
were unable to hire Argentine attorneys to pursue a suit in that
nation's courts.
   A federal judge threw out the suit. But it was reinstated in 1987
by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Former Reagan administration officials argued that allowing the
suit could have dire consequences for U.S. foreign policy.
   The case is Argentine Republic vs. Amerada Hess, 87-1372.

   An earthquake destroyed several mountain villages
in Tadzhikistan today, killing up to 1,000 people and burying one
village under a 45-foot wall of dirt and mud, officials said.
   ``Almost everybody died,'' said Zainiddin Nasreddinov,
editor-in-chief of the official Tadzhikistan news agency, who
visited the buried village of Sharora in Soviet Central Asia.
   A preliminary estimate indicated about 600 people died there, he
said in a telephone interview from Dushanbe, about 10 miles
northeast of Sharora. The population of the village was not known,
but Nasreddinov said about 70 families lived there.
   ``The total number of deaths is now evaluated at up to 1,000,''
said the official Tass news agency. It said hundreds died in Sharora
but did not give an exact figure.
   The quake struck about 1,800 miles southeast of Moscow, north of
Afghanistan and bordering China, at 2:02 a.m. (6:02 p.m. EST
Sunday). It was the strongest quake to hit the Soviet Union since
the Dec. 7 quake that struck Armenia and killed about 25,000 people.
   Rescue teams were searching for survivors and soldiers were
rushed to the area to keep order and restore communications and
power and water to the buildings left standing, said Nasreddinov.
   Roads into the area were damaged and thousands of head of cattle
were killed, Tass said. Bulldozers and cranes were being sent into
the area to help rescuers, the report said.
   The magnitude of the earthquake was uncertain.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. said it measured 6.0
on the Richter scale. The survey offices in Menlo Park, Calif. and
Reston, Va., put the magnitude at 5.4 on the Richter scale.
   A torrent of dirt and mud slid from a nearby hill and buried
Sharora after the earthquake hit, Nasreddinov said.
   ``Everything is destroyed _ all the homes, the schools, the
hospitals and clinics, the stores,'' he said. Communications,
electricity and water were disrupted and many injured were rushed to
hospitals in Dushanbe and other large cities.
   Tass said the quake caused ``destruction and casualties.''
   ``Small buildings made from earth were hit especially hard,''
Tass said. ``The quake caused a serious landslide, some two
kilometers (1\ miles) long, from a hill near the village.'' It said
Sharora was buried beneath 45 feet of mud and rocks.
   Nasreddinov said the buildings destroyed were all one-story
structures made of brick. He said Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev called Tadzhikistan officials to promise help from the
national government.
   In addition to the deaths in Sharora, 70 more people were
estimated to have died in the villages of Akulibolo and Akulipoyen,
near the epicenter, according to Nasreddinov. He said several other
villages were damaged.
   Local officials put the epicenter about 20 miles southwest of
Dushanbe, the republic's capital.
   A quake of magnitude 6 on the Richter scale can cause severe
damage in populated areas. A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a
major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand California Ban on Lawyer Endorsement Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a California
rule that virtually bans all lawyer advertisements featuring
testimonials or client endorsements.
   Six months after the high court said it would use a challenge to
the California rule to issue a decision that would bind all the
states, the justices dismissed the case.
   The court's one-sentence opinion said a Los Angeles lawyer's
appeal was being dropped ``for want of a properly presented federal
question.''
   Mark H. Oring of Los Angeles was reprimanded by the California
Bar Association for a radio commercial in which a client who had
been involved in an auto accident praised Oring and his partner.
   The client said that, thanks to Oring's firm, an insurance
company paid her twice the amount of money she originally was
awarded when her lawsuit went to trial.
   State bar officials said the commercial ``inherently tended to
confuse and mislead the public'' because it failed to explain that
the client's case was highly unusual and that such doubling of
awards in accident cases generally does not occur.
   Bar officials said the burden was on Oring to prove the ad was
truthful.
   Oring said the state rule presuming testimonials are deceptive
violated his free-speech rights. He said the rule has the effect of
banning truthful ads.
   The California Supreme Court rejected Oring's challenge to the
rule in 1987, and today's action by the nation's highest court
leaves the state rule undisturbed.
   The justices in 1977 ended the legal profession's longtime ban on
all lawyer advertising but left it to the states to ensure that ads
are not deceptive.
   The court said 12 years ago that lawyer advertising, like other
commercial speech, is not constitutionally protected if found to be
false or misleading.
   In a series of decisions since, the justices have forced states
to relax certain restrictions on lawyer advertising, such as a
Kentucky ban on direct-mail solicitation. The court last year said
states may not ban all direct-mail ads sent by lawyers to
prospective customers.
   Oring's partner, David A. Grey, also was reprimanded for the
firm's radio commercial, and lost a similar appeal to the nation's
highest court in 1987.
   The case is Oring vs. California, 87-1224.

   ``We are committed to agreement ... But we have to remain free
and self-governing,'' Walesa told about 5,000 people in this Baltic
port after announcing Sunday's decision by Solidarity's national
leadership.
   Deputy Prime Minister Ireneusz Sekula, explaining the party's
about-face on Solidarity, said the government needs compromise and
support from the opposition and society at large to help pull ``the
economy and people out from apathy, helplessness and stillness.''
   ``The economic reform needs political backing not only from the
government but also from the constructive opposition: it needs
social support,'' Sekula said in an interview published today by the
official news agency PAP.
   ``There is no choice. Either we decide on actions forming a
feasible chance of success or we reject them, selecting defeat right
from the start,'' he said.
   Solidarity's statement of acceptance, issued as its executive
committee ended a two-day meeting, was published by PAP and
broadcast as the first item on the national evening news.
   The acceptance clears the way for the first formal talks between
Solidarity and the authorities since Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, ended the union movement's 16-month legal existence with
a December 1981 military crackdown, interning thousands of union
activists.
   No date has been mentioned for the talks, but both sides have
indicated they could begin within a few weeks.
   Last week, the country's Communist leaders offered the prospect
of lifting the seven-year ban on Solidarity on the condition the
movement forfeit Western financial aid, embrace socialism and agree
to a two-year moratorium on strikes.
   The government that had for so long struggled to diminish
Solidarity's influence was now offering a partnership of sorts for
tackling Poland's chronic economic and social ills.
   Though heartened by the offer, wary Solidarity activists said
they suspected the government was seeking accord only to calm unrest
caused by rising inflation and consumer shortages. Poland's foreign
debt is $39 billion.
   ``I wish that there be no euphoria,'' Walesa cautioned the
thousands of supporters after a Mass at St. Brygida's Roman Catholic
church. ``Anything is still possible.''
   ``Is it true we will be solving Polish problems in a pluralistic
free way? We will see very soon,'' he said.
   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Solidarity's national spokesman, said
cooperation between the union movement and government now seems
``the only solution'' to Poland's crisis.
   He rejected a strike ban, but added: ``We want to discuss
economic reform. ... If it works then there will be no need to have
a general strike.'' Walesa has said he will not sign any agreement
at the cost of Solidarity's independence.
   After Sunday's Mass, about 1,000 people marched from the church
chanting, ``Solidarity! Solidarity! Legalize Solidarity!'' Police
blocked the march after a few blocks and the group disbanded
peacefully.
   Solidarity's statement Sunday said that by agreeing to negotiate
its reinstatement, the government had met its conditions for
beginning the talks authorities first proposed during a series of
strikes in August.
   ``We are responding, stretching out our hand because the other
side stretched out its hand too,'' said Walesa.
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski on Sunday said he ``could
imagine'' Solidarity one day becoming an opposition party but said
the organization would have to renounce its status as a trade union
to do so.
   ``The question is, what does Solidarity want to become,''
Rakowski said in an interview with the West German ZDF television
network. ``Does it want to become an opposition political party or a
trade union. I would like to know.''
   He did not specify what scope or rights such an opposition party
could have.
   The statement from Solidarity's 20-member executive commission,
adopted unanimously with one abstention, said it was ``necessary to
start negotiations as soon as possible.''
   Walesa told reporters that Solidarity, the only independent labor
movement ever permitted in the Soviet bloc, could be ready within
two months to hold its second nationwide congress. The first was
held in October 1981.
   He also indicated the union movement might resume its Weekly
Solidarity newspaper because ``without a press, we would be
nothing.''
   Solidarity announced that a committee of three veteran union
activists from the 1980 movement had been formed to ``prepare
negotiations with the authorities.'' They are Zbigniew Bujak,
Wladyslaw Frasyniuk and Mieczyslaw Gil.
   Gil, an organizer at the Nowa Huta steelworks outside the
southern city of Krakow, said he forsaw ``great difficulties'' and
warned that the talks have been viewed as a ``panacea.''
   ``Changing the model of the functioning of the Polish economy''
is a major problem ahead, Gil said, but ``what's most important is
that pluralism was unblocked.''

   Former Rep. Michael Barnes of Maryland is
dropping out of the race for chairmanship of the Democratic Party,
political sources said today.
   Barnes planned to endorse the candidacy of Ronald Brown, a
Washington attorney who was convention manager for Jesse Jackson.
   Barnes departure would leave four contenders for the post, now
held by Paul G. Kirk Jr., who declined to seek a second four-year
term.
   In addition to Brown, the candidates were former Reps. James
Stanton of Ohio and Jim Jones of Oklahoma and Michigan party
chairman Richard Wiener.
   A source, who asked not to be identified, said Barnes' candidacy
was doomed when Brown received the endorsement of the AFL-CIO. More
than 40 of the 400 votes on the Democratic National Committee are
cast by union officials.
   The Democrats are scheduled to elect their new party chairman on
Feb. 10.

<HEAD>Indians Start Campaign Against Grave Desecrations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OLNEY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Indians fed up with desecration of
ancestral graves by artifact hunters are launching a campaign
against international trading in Indian bones and relics.
   ``They come by the light of the moon ... they just ravage them,
dig them up,'' organizer Terry Warren said. ``If they are not the
ones that collect bones, they leave them scattered like a wild
animal would after tearing away at the carcass.''
   More than 25 Indian nations were represented Sunday at religious
ceremonies at looted burial sites followed by a meeting organized by
the fledgling Society Against Grave Exploitations, or SAGE, said
Warren, the group's executive director.
   ``We are not going to stand for this any more,'' said Warren, 38,
of Osage and Cherokee ancestry.
   He said 75 American Indians, in a meeting with 200 non-Indians,
decided to push for stronger federal laws against grave robbing,
which could be despoiling as many as 175,000 burial sites a year.
   ``We are putting aside our social and custom differences and
going to attack this thing as a body of united peoples,'' he said.
   Many wore traditional dress for the religious ceremonies, held at
the sites of over 40 holes that once were graves scattered
throughout the area in southeastern Illinois.
   Warren said participants included a Ricaree sun dancer from St.
Louis, Mo., a Choctaw from Louisiana, Sioux from the Dakotas,
Cherokees from Tennessee, a Seneca fom New York and Comanches from
Oklahoma.
   He said there is a nationwide network of grave robbers and the
collectors they supply.
   ``It's everywhere in this country, it involves mega-, megabucks
maybe like money in the cocaine trade _ figures larger than people
can even imagine,'' Warren said.
   He said a ceremonial pipe can bring $500 to $1,500 on the illegal
market and a piece of pottery as much as $45,000. Warren said
interest in the items appears especially strong now among West
German and Japanese collectors.
   ``And in most states it's pretty easy to get away with because of
the lack of laws ... (protecting) our people's graves,'' Warren
said. Some states have passed laws making the practice a felony, but
in most, a robber can only be charged with trespassing, a
misdemeanor that may carry a $50 fine, he said.
   Looting graves on federal land is a felony.
   Elsewhere Sunday, an auction of Indian artifacts at Phelps, N.Y.,
drew complaints that the selling of artifacts encourages grave
robbers.
   ``I think there's a destruction of our ancestors in that act and
there's a destruction of a historical record,'' said Peter Jemison,
a Seneca and director of a 300-year-old Seneca village state
historic site at Ganondagon, N.Y., near Rochester. ``One person
comes in and lets his greed _ and there's no other word for it _
come before everything else.''
   ``If something was buried with an individual, then it was a gift
to them. It was meant to stay with them forever,'' Jemison said. He
said he favors finding the original locations of the items when
possible, and reburying them with the people to whom they belong.

<HEAD>Honecker Announces Unilitaral Cutback In Armed Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German leader Erich Honecker today announced
his nation will reduce its armed forces by 10,000 soldiers and
reduce defense spending 10 percent.
   Honecker said that as part of the cutback, six tank regiments and
an air force squadron would be mustered out, resulting in a
reduction of 600 tanks and 50 warplanes.
   ``At the same time, the national outlay for defense will be
reduced by 10 percent,'' Honecker said.
   The surprise move follows an announcement by Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev last month that the Kremlin was reducing its own
troops, including those stationed in Eastern Europe.
   East Germany has about 120,000 soldiers, 3,000 main battle tanks
and 350 combat aircraft, according to estimates by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``These decisions have been made made in order to make a further
constructive contribution to disarmament,'' Honecker said in a
speech during a reception for Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson.
   ``It is done to show through actions our good will in reducing
conventional forces and in the hope that other European nations will
be inspired to do the same,'' Honecker added.
   The Communist leader said the tanks would either be destroyed or
converted for civilian use. He did not elaborate.
   Honecker said the cuts would be completed by the end of 1990 to
give the East German army ``an even more defensive character.''
   Gorbachev, in a speech to the United Nations in December, said
the Soviets would be pulling 50,000 men and 5,000 tanks from East
Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary over the next two years. It is
believed the Soviets have 500,000 troops in that region.
   NATO officials have welcomed Gorbachev's initiative but maintain
that the Warsaw Pact would still retain superiority in conventional
forces in Europe.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a radio interview on Sunday
spoke out against a reduction in West German forces if there were no
substantive changes in the European balance of military power.
   East-West negotiations on reducing conventional military forces
in Europe are slated to begin in March in Vienna.

<HEAD>St. Lawrence Seaway Shipping Season Closes at Four-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The St. Lawrence Seaway in 1988 finished its
best shipping season in four years despite a 3.2 million ton drop in
Canadian grain shipments due to the summer drought.
   A total of 40.5 million metric tons of cargo moved through the
inland waterway in 1988, a gain of 561,000 tons over 1987, seaway
officials have said.
   The seaway more than compensated for the decline in Canadian
grain by taking on higher tonnages of other bulk commodities, such
as chemicals and stone, which set seaway records last year.
   ``Traditionally, we're viewed as a grain system, but the system
definitely is becoming more diversified and is being used for a much
broader mix of cargo,'' U.S. seaway administrator James L. Emery
said in a statement.
   The waterway runs from Duluth, Minn., through the Great Lakes to
the St. Lawrence River, emptying into the Atlantic. It is jointly
operated by the United States and Canada.
   Last year was the third consecutive year of moderate total
tonnage increases through the seaway, Emery said, crediting
marketing efforts and networking by the Great Lakes maritime
industry, including the International Association of Great Lakes
Ports and state and private-sector groups.
   While the tonnage of Canadian grain shipped through the seaway
fell 25 percent to 9.9 million metric tons, U.S. grain shipments
climbed 8 percent, to 5.5 million metric tons in 1988. Last year was
the second consecutive year that U.S. grain tonnages have increased
since a low in 1986, seaway officials said.
   Among reasons for increases in U.S. grain shipments were a lower
dollar, larger U.S. grain reserves, increased U.S. grain purchases
by the Soviet Union and the U.S. export enhancement program, they
said.
   The decline in seaway grain shipments in 1988 was offset
primarily by a 4.1 million ton increase in coal, coke, steel, iron
ore and selected bulk cargoes.

   Police closed four massage parlors linked to
prostitution and arrested 13 people on Hainan, a remote southern
island that has recently drawn investors and tourists, a newspaper
said Monday.
   The People's Daily said the illegal parlors were in the
provincial capital of Haikou, which just a year ago had only a few
centers offering legitimate medical massage.
   But since Hainan was made a development zone in April, ``signs
reading, `Mystery Massage,' `Wild Village Massage Center,' `Massage:
Please Come In' and every kind of advertisement have popped up on
Haikou's street corners and alleys,'' the report said.
   The communists, who took power in 1949, outlawed and virtually
wiped out prostitution. However, in the past decade prostitution has
reappeared, especially in the boomtown atmosphere of many southern
cities.

   A leading Marxist theorist criticized in 1987 as
too liberal said Monday that authorities have barred newspapers from
publishing a speech in which he called for greater academic freedom.
   ``I believe what I said was true. Whether it is biting or not, it
should be said,'' Su Shaozhi said in a telephone interview. He said
he has not been officially criticized for the speech, in which he
also declared Marxism in China to be in a state of crisis.
   Su gave the speech in December at a forum called by the Communist
Party Propaganda Department.
   On Dec. 26, before the Propaganda Department barred the speech
from publication, the World Economic Herald published it. The paper
said Monday that it had not suffered any political repercussions and
denied rumors that its editor, Chen Benli, had been fired.
   ``There is a rumor that (Chen) will leave his job, but there has
been no official announcement,'' an editor who identified himself
only as Su said in a telephone interview. Su is a common name and he
was not related to Su Shaozhi.
   However, the editor said that ``many scholars have held meetings
to discuss'' the speech, and many people have come to the paper to
talk to editors about it. The Herald has a reputation for publishing
more daring views than other state-run newspapers.
   Su Shaozhi, 65, was fired in 1987 as head of the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences' Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse-tung Thought Research
Institute. He and several other intellectuals were accused of not
being socialist enough and of being too fond of Western-style
democracy.
   Su was allowed to continue his reseach at the institute and kept
his party membership. But in his speech he criticized treatment of
others who were stripped of their jobs and party membership in 1987
and previously.
   ``Since the (People's Republic) was established, we have had 34
mass criticisms of natural scientists,'' he said. ``Not one of the
attacks has been correct. Science and culture have suffered serious
damage.'' He said the purges violated constitutional guarantees of
academic freedom and the scientific spirit.
   ``One of the reasons academic freedom has not been achieved is
some leaders in theoretical circles call themselves Marxists but
actually use simplified, dogmatic and ossified ideas from the '30s
and '40s to decide what is right and wrong,'' he wrote.
   Asked in the interview who he referred to, Su named Hu Qiaomu and
Deng Liqun, elderly conservatives who were forced later in 1987 to
step down from their main party posts.
   ``They continue to have influence,'' Su said. But he said
dogmatic interpretation of Marxism, including an emphasis on class
struggle and centralization of authority, began with revolutionary
leader Mao Tse-tung.
   Since Mao's death in 1976, the party has acknowledged he made
mistakes and dropped his emphasis on class struggle. But it
continues periodic campaigns against liberalism.
   Su favors a freer interpretation of Marxism that would allow for
greater democracy and more private ownership.

   They also chanted the name of writer Vaclav Havel, one of
Czechoslovakia's most prominent members of the human rights group
Charter 77, and unfurled a banner saying, ``Jan Palach, symbol of

   Havel was detained Jan. 16 when activists in Prague tried to lay
flowers in memory of Jan Palach, a student who burned himself alive
20 years ago to protest the end of the ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   Socialist Party member Piotr Ikonowicz spoke to the crowd about
the events in Prague before police came and detained him and fellow
party activist Cezary Mirzejewski. Protesters booed and whistled at
the police.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II has invited U.S. bishops to
submit topics they want to discuss with him at a special meeting in
March, a Vatican official said Monday.
   The Vatican announced earlier this month that 35 U.S. archbishops
will participate in talks in mid-March with the pope.
   U.S. churchmen had requested the meeting two years ago, when many
were concerned about the disciplining by the Vatican of Seattle
Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen, a liberal.
   On Monday, the Vatican released a text of the pope's Jan. 10
letter to U.S. bishops in which he told them he has set aside March
8-11 to meet with them.
   The pope told the bishops that ``it is my intention to reflect
with you on an organic pastoral view of our episcopal ministry.''
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the pope desired to ``talk
openly, to think together'' with the bishops about their role today.
   He said the meeting will cover a mutually agreed-upon agenda and
that the Vatican was waiting to receive the bishops' suggestions.
   Last year, at the annual session of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops in Washington, differences surfaced between the
Vatican and the American side.
   The bishops sent back a Vatican draft document that questions the
authority of national bishops' conferences, marking it as not
``suitable as a basis for discussion.''
   The pope's Jan. 10 letter said the ``pastoral view'' must ``also
express the indisputable priorities of the life of the church today,
both in her universal needs and in the special requirements of the
Church in the United States. At the same time it must faithfully
reflect the call of the Second Vatican Council to reform and renewal
as reiterated'' by the pope and bishops worldwide.

<HEAD>Stolen Rosary Beads Back After Nine Years</HEAD>

   Nine years after a thief took a nun's purse
containing her silver rosary beads, a hurricane and a helpful
stranger have given Sister Margaret Mary Wagner reason to believe in
miracles.
   ``You know, you hear a lot about the nonsense that goes on, but I
believe there is still a lot of goodness in the world,'' said Sister
Wagner, principal of St. Bonaventure Elementary School in suburban
Glenshaw. ``Miracles still happen. I believe, I believe!''
   Sister Wagner said she and her sister were vacationing on Sanibel
Island, off the Florida coast near Fort Myers, when her purse was
stolen from the beach. The purse also contained Sister Wagner's
wallet and identification cards, and her sister's keys.
   The beads, which had belonged to Sister Wagner's mother, arrived
by mail Jan. 14.
   In a brief note, Tom Dirst of Fort Myers, Fla., said he found the
purse near a lighthouse on Sanibel Island, where it washed up on the
beach following Hurricane Keith on Dec. 6.
   ``The silver beads had barnacles on them, and the keys, though
wrapped in paper toweling, were corroded and sand-encrusted,'' she
said. ``I couldn't believe it.''
   Sister Wagner took the rosary to a jeweler for cleaning and
polishing, and wrote a thank-you note to Dirst.

   Armed civilians seized a small
military base near the capital today, and at least six people were
killed before troops were able to retake most of the facility, news
reports and officials said.
   Soldiers and Buenos Aires provincial police backed by tanks
surrounded several buildings where the civilian fighters were holed
up, state and independent news agencies reported.
   Under a hazy summer sun, two small tanks opened the noon
counterattack, firing on the officers' club in which the civilians
were thought to be isolated, the state news agency Telam said.
Sporadic shooting continued several hours.
   Provincial government and police sources said four soldiers were
killed and eight soldiers or police wounded. At least two civilian
fighters were killed, the private news agency Diarios y Noticias
reported.
   Earlier news reports said three civilians and two police were
killed. It was not clear if the later reports included these
casualties.
   The Ministry of Defense, anticipating a possible fourth
insurrection against the government in the past 21 months, bolstered
defenses at Government House and the official residence of President
Raul Alfonsin, Telam said.
   The civilian president spoke by telephone with Defense Minister
Horacio Jaunarena and Army Chief Gen. Francisco Gassino and told
them to retake the base, presidential press secretary Jose Ignacio
Lopez told reporters.
   Buenos Aires provincial police surrounded it, began to evacuate
nearby residents, and took up firing positions in private homes.
   The civilian attackers carried pamphlets supporting officers who
have led previous uprisings, DyN said.
   The incident comes less than two months after a short-lived
barracks insurrection to protest Alfonsin's treatment of the
military.
   The seizure occurred at the 3rd Infantry Regiment at La Tablada,
12 miles northwest of the capital, Buenos Aires.
   Defense Ministry officials made no comment and the precise number
of civilians involved or soldiers at the base was not known.
   The attack began about 3 a.m., when civilians threw several small
explosive devices onto the base compound, DyN reported.
   Employees at a nearby gas station said that at about 6:15 a.m.,
civilians in a truck crashed through the regiment's main gate, DyN
said. Six cars followed.
   A total of 40 to 50 men and women dressed in civilian clothes
were in the truck and cars, news agencies reported. Police put the
number at about 30.
   According to DyN, as they entered the base, the civilians threw
pamphlets supporting what is known as the ``New Argentine Army'' of
Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, who led short-lived army uprisings in April 1987
and January 1988. Rico was dismissed and now is in prison.
   Other pamphlets read ``Long Live Rico!'' and ``Long Live
Seineldin!'' DyN reported. Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin led a four-day
uprising in December. He also is in prison.
   The base was almost empty at the time of the attack, the news
agencies reported. They said most officers and non-commissioned men
had left for the weekend and had not returned.
   The December insurrection began after officers at several army
bases, including La Tablada, tried to incite troops. Seineldin
surrendered four days later.
   The only clashes reported during that insurrection were between
troops and civilians, many of whom harbor animosity toward the
military.
   On Friday, President Alfonsin told a news conference that
factions within the army still are angry over issues such as the
prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the
1976-83 military dictatorship, which he was elected in 1983 to
replace.
   ``I affirm categorically that those factions are not going to
have the possibilities to triumph,'' Alfonsin said. ``But I should
say with absolute seriousness that I am not in the position of
assuring with the same force and certainty that there will not be
other episodes.''

<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soul singer James Brown today pleaded guilty
to seven misdemeanor charges stemming from a chase by police in two
states and was sentenced to six years in jail and fined $1,000.
   Earlier today, Brown's wife received probation and a $600 fine
after pleading no contest to a charge of driving under the influence.
   Brown, who is serving a six-year sentence in South Carolina,
pleaded guilty to having no state license tag, reckless driving,
driving with a suspended license, attempting to flee or elude
police, carrying a deadly weapon to a public gathering, simple
assault and improper lane change.
   He also pleaded no contest to driving under the influence.
   Richmond County State Court Judge Gayle B. Hamrick said Brown's
sentence would run concurrently with the sentence in neighboring
South Carolina. The charges in both states resulted from the last
September across the Georgia-South Carolina line.
   The charges against the singer's 33-year-old wife, Adrienne,
resulted from a September 1987 incident in which she was charged
with driving under the influence, speeding and criminal trespass. In
exchange for her no contest plea, which neither admits nor denies
guilt, the state agreed to drop the speeding and criminal trespass
charges.
   In addition to the fine and probation, the judge sentenced Mrs.
Brown to two days of community service, ordered her to attend an
alcohol and drug education course and required her to pay $75
restitution for damage to a sheriff's patrol car.
   Brown told USA Today in a recent interview that he was
``dealing'' with being in prison. ``A lot of people would like to
see me fall, but you can't make a winner a loser,'' he was quoted as
saying in today's editions of the newspaper.
   He conceded his situation was ``sticky'' but said prison has
``mellowed'' him. Brown, 55, said he gained 14 needed pounds,
adding, ``I wore myself all the way out last year.''
   The singer still must appear before a South Carolina judge to
determine whether he violated terms of a probation handed down in
Aiken County last July. In that case, Brown received a 2{-year
suspended sentence and was fined $1,200 after pleading guilty to
carrying a pistol and resisting arrest.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
   
   The court, dealing a serious blow to some forms of affirmative
action, today struck down a Richmond, Va., program aimed at helping
construction industry businesses owned by minorities.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court ruled the plan is an unlawful form of
reverse discrimination.
   The case is Richmond vs. Croson, 87-998.
   
   HELICOPTER SEARCHES
   
   The court ruled that police do not need court warrants before
searching from helicopters for marijuana growing in fenced-in yards.
   The court, by a 5-4 vote, said sheriff's deputies in Pasco
County, Fla., did not violate anyone's privacy rights five years ago
when searching for marijuana from a helicopter hovering 400 feet
above the ground.
   The case is Florida vs. Riley, 87-764.
   
   FALKLANDS
   
   The court ruled, in a case stemming from the 1982 war over the
Falkland Islands, that Argentina may not be sued in U.S. courts for
attacking a neutral oil tanker.
   The 9-0 decision killed a suit against Argentine officials by a
foreign corporation engaged in U.S. trade. The former Reagan
administration urged the justices to throw out the suit.
   The case is Argentine Republic vs. Amerada Hess, 87-1372.
   
   SEABROOK
   
   The court refused to let a financially troubled utility company
increase electric rates to help pay for a controversial nuclear
power plant in Seabrook, N.H.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``properly presented federal
question,'' left intact a New Hampshire law barring rate hikes to
pay for nuclear plant construction before the facilities are
completed.
   The case is Public Service Co. vs. New Hampshire, 87-1613.
   
   DRUG DEATH
   
   The court refused to shield New York from possibly paying part of
the $702,000 award won by the family of a man who died 26 years ago
in a secret Army chemical warfare experiment.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that New York may
be sued by federal officials seeking to force the state to help pay
the award.
   The case is New York vs. U.S., 88-745.
   
   LONGSHOREMEN
   
   _ The court rejected an effort to preserve longshoremen's jobs in
the face of changing technology.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that labor
agreements between the International Longshoremen's Association and
shipping companies softening the impact of ``containerization'' at
Gulf and Atlantic coast ports violate federal shipping law.
   The case is ILA vs. Federal Maritime Commission, 88-756.
   
   ORKIN
   
   The court refused to hear an appeal by a pest control company
ordered to roll back a fee increase it charged to more than 200,000
customers nationwide.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that Orkin
Exterminating Co. acted in good faith in hiking renewal fees to
produce more than $7.5 million in extra revenue.
   The case is Orkin vs. FTC, 88-710.
   
   REDGRAVE
   
   The court refused to revive actress Vanessa Redgrave's lawsuit
against the Boston Symphony Orchestra for canceling her performances
following threats by protesters.
   The court, without comment, let stand a $39,500
breach-of-contract award won by Ms. Redgrave but barred any
additional damages based on claims that her civil and constitutional
rights were violated.
   The case is Redgrave vs. Boston Symphony, 88-912.
   
   PRIVACY
   
   The court today refused to postpone a trial for a $3 million
invasion-of-privacy lawsuit against the Los Angeles Times.
   The justices, rejecting the newspaper's emergency request,
cleared the way for trial to begin Feb. 17 in San Diego.
   The case is Times Mirror Co. vs. Doe, A-568.
   
   INSURANCE
   
   The court left intact a $1.25 million punitive-damages award won
against an insurance company by an Alabama man suffering from
cataracts in both eyes.
   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by Nationwide
Mutual Insurance Co.
   The court already has under study the issue of skyrocketing
awards in personal-injury lawsuits. But the justices acted on the
Nationwide case before issuing any decision in that case.
   The case is Nationwide vs. Clay, 88-157.
   
   LIBEL LAWSUIT
   
   The court refused to kill a $150,000 libel lawsuit against a
Waco, Texas, newspaper by a justice of the peace wrongly identified
in a news article as a convicted thief.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that force the
Waco Tribune-Herald to defend itself at trial against John B.
Guinn's suit.
   The case is Cox Enterprises vs. Guinn, 88-631.
   
   MAGAZINE-LIBEL
   
   The court today refused to revive a libel lawsuit against the
publisher of Us magazine by the daughter of a New York doctor who
murdered his wife with a deadly injection.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that Esther
Friedgood failed to show that the allegedly libelous statements
about her were published with ``actual malice.''
   Her appeal argued that lower courts wrongly treated her as a
``public figure'' in the case.
   The case is Friedgood vs. Peters Publishing Co., 88-863.
   
   PAPAL STAMP
   
   A group supporting the separation of church and state lost a
Supreme Court challenge to a cancellation stamp that commemorated a
1987 visit to the United States by Pope John Paul II.
   The court, without comment, refused to revive a lawsuit by the
Texas-based Society of Separationists against the Postal Service.
   The group's leader, Ralph B. Shirley of Austin, Texas, said the
stamp improperly used taxpayer money to promote religion.
   The case is Shirely vs. Schraer, 88-712.
   
   FOOTBALL RECRUITING
   
   The court, in a case sparked by a football recruiting scandal at
Southern Methodist University, today refused to let news
organizations see confidential investigation files on SMU and other
Texas schools.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that files
compiled by the NCAA and the Southwest Athletic Conference do not
have to be made public under the Texas Open Records Act.
   The case is Kneeland vs. NCAA, 88-884.

   President Bush declared today the lights in his
White House will ``burn brightly well after dark'' and he instructed
his senior staff to put in long hours. He also told them to avoid
even the appearance of conflict of interest.
   On another subject, at mid-day the new president spoke to
anti-abortion demonstrators in a special telephone hookup from the
Oval Office, telling them he shared their concern about ``our
American tragedy, abortion on demand.''
   He reiterated his support of a constitutional amendment barring
most abortions. ``I'm confident that more and more Americans every
year, every day, are hearing your message and taking it to heart,''
Bush told the demonstrators, who were preparing a protest march.
   Earlier, Bush said, ``Let's go to work,'' as he presided at a
brief ceremony in the East Room at which 65 White House staff
members were sworn in by Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Bush was to preside later in the day at his first Cabinet meeting.
   His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, meanwhile, said Japanese Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita would meet with Bush in Washington on Feb.
2 in what may be Bush's first meeting as president with a foreign
head of state.
   Fitzwater said Bush invited Takeshita in order to demonstrate his
administration's commitment to good U.S.-Japanese relations. Bush
will travel to Japan later in February to attend the funeral of
Japanese Emperor Hirohito.
   Fitzwater also said that Bush might call Mikhail Gorbachev to
thank him personally for the Soviet leader's congratulatory message.
He said Bush had received over 30 such messages from foreign leaders.
   Bush, in his meeting with staff members, stressed the importance
of maintaining a strict ethical code. Fitzwater said the president
would shortly set up a commission to propose ways of strengthening
ethics laws governing both administration officials and members of
Congress.
   Bush told his senior staff, ``It's not really very complicated.
It's a question of knowing right from wrong, avoiding conflicts of
interest, bending over backwards to see that there's no even a
perception of a conflict of interest,'' the new president said.
   ``Our actions must always be of the highest integrity.''
   Bush addressed his staff at 8:30 a.m. By then, he had already
been at work for more than an hour, meeting with Quayle at a 7:15
a.m. breakast session and with chief of staff John Sununu.
   The president indicated he expected a similar work schedule from
members of his staff. He appealed for understanding from spouses who
watched the ceremony.
   ``Your husbands and wives are embarking on an ordeal that is
known to be a time-consuming killer ... The lights burn well after
dark around this place,'' Bush said.
   He said he expected ``long hours and hard work ... But these long
hours can result in new opportunity for all.''
   Bush reiterated that his top priority was tackling the budget
deficit _ which he will focus on throughout the week, beginning with
a meeting Tuesday with congressional leaders.
   ``We have an immense opportunity to make life better for the
people in this country,'' He said. ``We can, by hard work, make this
a safer and more secure country.''
   Quayle had been asked by Bush to swear in the staff. He asked the
aides to raise their right hands and take the oath to ``support and
defend the Constitution of the United States'' and to ``well and
faithfully discharge the duties of the office of which I am proud to
enter.''
   ``It's my first official act,'' Quayle quipped.
   At one point, as the voices of children in the audience began to
rise, Bush interrupted his speech and joked: ``I'm glad they're
someone else's kids.'' He hinted that having his 10 grandchildren in
the White House all weekend had been something of an ordeal. ``In
the last 48 hours, they've been everywhere,'' he said.
   Among those sworn in were national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft; David Bates Jr., secretary to the Cabinet; Richard C.
Breeden, assistant for issues analysis; Andrew H. Card Jr., deputy
to the chief of staff; David Demarest, communications director;
Marlin Fitzwater, press secretary; C. Boyden Gray, counsel to the
president; Frederick D. McClure, assistant for legislative affairs;
and Roger B. Porter, assistant for domestic policy.
   Sununu attended the ceremony but did not raise his right hand; he
had been sworn in by Quayle privately earlier today.
   Bush was turning his attention to business after a $25 million
inaugural extravaganza.
   He addressed the anti-abortion protesters who gathered on the
Ellipse, just south of the White House. The demonstration was called
to protest the Supreme Court's Jan. 22, 1973, decision legalizing
abortion.
   Reagan addressed the annual march and rally in the same fashion
in previous years.
   Bush opposed a constitutional amendment banning abortions when he
first ran for president in 1980, but later changed his position.
   In his 1988 presidential campaign, he voiced support for an
amendment that would prohibit abortions except in cases of incest or
rape or to save the life of the mother.
   And, as recently as his inaugural address on Friday, Bush made a
passing reference to the issue.
   There, he spoke of ``young women to be helped who are about to
become mothers of children they can't care for and might not love.
They need our care, our guidance, and our education, though we bless
them for choosing life.''
   Spokesman Fitzwater said Sunday the president will withhold
specifics on his budget plans until a Feb. 9 address to a joint
session of Congress. However, he plans to start the ball rolling on
Tuesday when he meets with congressional leaders.

<HEAD>Library Loses $50,000 More for Evicting Cat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It didn't cost much to keep Muffin the
cat at the Putnam Valley library _ food, cat box litter, an
occasional rubber mouse maybe. But letting her go has gotten very
expensive _ $80,000 so far.
   Dr. John Zarcone said Sunday that he had dropped plans to
contribute $50,000 for a children's audio-visual room at the library
because Muffin had been evicted.
   Earlier this month, Marjorie Horton, 94, a former Putnam Valley
resident now living in New York City, said she wrote a $30,000
bequest for the library out of her will over the incident.
   Muffin, who had been living at the library since showing up on
its doorstep seven years ago, was evicted after a volunteer director
said she was allergic to cats and could not work in the library.
   Peter Grosewald, chairman of the board of the privately run
library, said keeping the cat in another room didn't work, and the
director even offered to resign. But the board decided that if
keeping a cat meant someone could not go to the library, the cat
would have to go.
   There also were allegations that Muffin had swatted at some
children without provocation, but Grosewald said, ``The only issue
is access. We have to assure access to everybody.''
   ``Even if it were a million dollars, it would be a hard choice,''
he said after Mrs. Horton's decision.
   Grosewald said Muffin has a good new home.
   Zarcone, of Putnam Valley, said he would find another
organization for his $50,000. Mrs. Horton has said she will leave
her money to three animal shelters.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet Jew who was denied permission to
emigrate 13 years ago finally is being reunited with his family in
Chicago, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said Monday.
   Alexander Pyatetsky was to arrive at O'Hare International Airport
Monday night, ending a nine-month separation from his wife and two
children, said Simon, who helped the man get permission to emigrate.
   Pyatetsky had not seen his brother, Mark, since the brother left
the Soviet Union in 1975 and has not seen his parents since they
joined Mark Pyatetsky in the United States in 1980, the senator said.
   ``No family should ever have to endure what the Pyatetsky family
has gone through,'' Simon said. ``We finally have a happy ending to
a long, sad and unnecessary story.''
   According to Simon, Pyatetsky repeatedly applied for permission
to emigrate and was denied each time for security reasons, based on
a clearance he received for a short period more than 15 years ago.
   His wife, Sofia, and children _ Dmitry, 14, and Julia, 5 _ were
permitted to leave, however. They departed their home in Kiev and
arrived in Illinois in April, risking separation on the assumption
that Pyatetsky would follow them quickly.
   Simon, a supporter of efforts to help Jews leave the Soviet Union
for new homes in the United States and Israel, joined Mark Pyatetsky
and his parents, Sarra and Michael, in a prayer vigil on the Capitol
steps in 1986.
   He also arranged for a meeting between members of the family and
Secretary of State George Shultz in September 1988 to plead
Pyatetsky's case and repeatedly contacted Soviet officials on his
behalf.
   In November, Pyatetsky was told he could leave and should start
preparing for his departure.
   ``I applaud President (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev for this trend
toward freer emigration, especially for Soviet Jews,'' Simon said.
``We hope it continues.''

Benjamin Franklin successfully launched a Trident 1 missile Monday
while cruising submerged in the Atlantic Ocean off Cape Canaveral,
the Navy reported.
   A Navy statement said the 34-foot missile performed normally
after it was unleashed from the submarine and sent its dummy warhead
to an ocean target. The weapon has a range of 4,600 miles, but
officials declined for security reasons to disclose how far Monday's
Trident 1 traveled.
   Purpose of the launching was to demonstrate the submarine crew's
ability to safely handle, maintain and operate the weapon system.
The firing was the 31st such demonstration firing for the Trident 1,
the Navy said.
   The Benjamin Franklin carries 24 of the missiles while on

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet military on Monday stepped
up emergency airlifts to ease severe food shortages it blamed on
hoarding and inefficiency by Afghan authorities.
   ``The local administration did not give out orders in time for
when they needed to get food supplies,'' said Maj. Gen. Lev Serebrov
as troops hauled tons of flour off Ilyushin-76 cargo planes.
   ``And some of the traders are not selling in order to raise
prices,'' he said. ``There are enough supplies in the city but they
are keeeping it to themsleves.''
   Soviet officials said 400 to 500 tons of flour were arriving
daily on a dozen flights from the Soviet cities of Tashkent and
Fergana, both about an hour from Kabul by plane.
   The airlift began over the weekend and probably would continue
through the week, Serebrov said.
   The supplies had an immediate impact on the food shortage, also
blamed partly on disruption of road supply convoys by Moslem
guerrillas fighting the Afghan government and the Soviet troops.
   Lines at bread stores were shorter and in some cases disappeared,
but a severe shortage of fuel continued.
   It was unclear whether the Soviets would be able to mount food
airlifts after they pull out of the capital as part of their
withdrawal from Afghanistan, expected to be completed by Feb. 15.
   The Soviets say the impoverished city of 2 million people needs
120 tons of flour a day, but some Afghan officials say it needs 500
tons.
   Most Soviet troops and their leaders are expected to leave Kabul
between Jan. 31 and Feb. 2, and head north up the 250-mile Salang
highway. This would leave aircraft more vulnerable to attacks by the
guerrillas, who are armed with rockets and anti-aircraft missiles
supplied by the United States and Pakistan.
   The guerrillas have been fighting the Afghan government since the
communists seized power in April 1978, and are expected to close in
on President Najib's Marxist administration when the Soviets leave.
   About 50,000 Soviet troops pulled out in August under an
agreement mediated by the United Nations to end the Soviet
military's nine-year intervention in the nation. About 50,000 troops
remain.
   The guerrillas are not a party to the U.N. pact.
   Serebrov said the Afghan army had set up a 12{-mile ``safety
belt'' around the city to protect the airport.
   The guerrillas' rockets have a range of about 19 miles. Last
week, six rockets landed in the eastern part of the city near the
airport, killing four people and wounding nine.
   Helicopters clattered over the snow-covered mountains ringing the
city as the transport planes landed, and soldiers packed
anti-missile flares into metal holders on the planes' fuselages
before they took off.
   In the city, military truck convoys crawled through the streets
carrying flour to state-run depots. Thousands more tons were crammed
into a movie theater-turned-warehouse at the Soviet base.
   Troops who unloaded flour at the airport told western reporters
that they had, in the words of several, ``fulfilled our duty to
Afghanistan'' and looked forward to going home.
   Fifteen Soviet paratroopers gathered in a recreation room at the
airport answered reporters' questions with stiff, terse replies.
   ``The sad thing is that opposition groups here are fighting
against their own people ... That's something I'll never
understand,'' Vladimir Demimyaza, a 21-year-old private, said when
asked about his thoughts on 18 months of fighting the guerrillas.
   ``The happy thing is that the Afghan army has a lot of experience
now ... They've been taught, I think, to protect themselves on their
own after we leave,'' he said.
   On the prospect of leaving, Maj. Valery Kurilo said: ``I won't
miss it, perhaps, but I'll always remember it.''
   Serebrov denied the Soviet withdrawal has resumed and has said
that hundreds of fully equipped Soviet troops who have been seen
boarding transports have been replaced.
   Western diplomatic sources say the pullout began at the beginning
of the month.
   On Monday, six tanks accompanied by a 60-vehicle convoy of
troops, and armored personnel carriers were seen heading north along
the Salang highway.

   ``Dali will never die,'' the artist said 15 years ago. ``My soul
will live on and on and I will keep creating and creating.''
   Salvador Dali described himself as being in a race with death to
create as much as possible. Inevitably, death caught him _ on Monday
at age 84 in Figueras, Spain, the Catalonian town where he was born.
   At the time of the interview with The Associated Press in 1974,
one of Dali's projects was to have himself frozen just before he
died and return at some future time.
   He said he made long trips by sea because ``flying is ugly.''
   ``I have been on an airplane three times in my life and I will
never fly again,'' he said. While a plane is in the air, Dali
declared, ``all colors on the ground jumble together and I don't
like it.''
   The interview took place in New York shortly after he had created
the ``Hawaii Suite'' of lithographs without having visited Hawaii.
   ``I have never been to any exotic country like Hawaii, but there
was no need,'' he said. ``The reason is: exoticism already existed
in my mind, inside my brain.''
   Whatever his wealth _ and he was secretive about its extent _
Dali claimed his most cherished possession was a small piece of
driftwood he carried in his pocket, tucked into an old, tattered
sock.
   ``I picked this up on a beach in the Mediterranean in 1931 while
walking with my wife,'' he said. ``It represents all my love for
her. I value it more than any other thing in the world.''
   Dali and Gala Dimitrovna Diaharoff met in 1929 when she and her
husband, the French surrealist poet Paul Eluard, visited the painter
at his seaside home in northeastern Spain.
   At Dali's request she never left, and they married in 1958, six
years after Eluard's death. Gala died in 1982.

   It's harder to fall asleep or daydream
during reading of the minutes of the 21st Senate of the Academic
Council at Stanford University, now that Arthur Coladarci is
academic secretary.
   Out with such phrasing as ``The meeting was called to order by
...''
   With Coladarci wielding his pen, the report reads: ``(Chairman
John) Kaplan rapped his gavel smartly at approximately 3:20 p.m.,
and all but an impish chemist responded appropriately _ but he
complied cheerfully with Kaplan's personalized invitation to join
the otherwise respectful assembly.''
   Coladarci, 71, a professor emeritus of psychology and education,
says that when he began writing the minutes last fall, he set out to
inject some fun into the official record of a body that decides a
variety of academic issues.
   ``I have never been comfortable with the general assumption that
minutes ought to be sober things,'' Coladarci said. ``Meetings are
not only sober occasions. People are people and even the most
serious discussions have in them a little irony, a little humor.''
   Coladarci certainly doesn't take himself too seriously, as shown
in this paragraph from the Dec. 1 minutes: ``The Senate tacitly gave
its secular absolution to the Academic Secretary for the venial
misspelling of `tendentious' in the draft version of the Nov. 10
minutes.''
   Nel Noddings, a professor of education, gave Coladarci high
praise for minutes he kept for the school of education:
   ``The minutes were always read.''

   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission
acknowledged for the first time today that it has worked with the
FBI from the beginning of an investigation into fraud at the
nation's two largest futures exchanges.
   The federal commission regulates the commodities markets, as the
Securities and Exchange Commission monitors the stock and bond
markets.
   CFTC spokeswoman Kate Hathaway declined to provide specifics of
the commission's role in probing allegations of profit skimming from
investors, but said a statement would be issued after the markets
closed.
   Meanwhile, commodities traders were reported scrambling for
attorneys as federal authorities continued the investigation into
trading practices at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   The investigation centers on allegations that as many as 100
brokers and traders systematically cheated customers out of millions
of dollars.
   The undercover sting operation became public Thursday when
federal agents began serving traders, brokerage firms and the
exchanges with subpoenas. The result was panic in many trading
circles.
   The Chicago Tribune reported Sunday that the FBI launched the
probe following a complaint by the Archer Daniels Midland Co., a
Decatur-based grain-processing company, of possible violations.
   Former U.S Attorney Dan Webb, now a lawyer in private practice,
said he returned to his office Thursday night after a day in court
to find 10 messages from traders seeking a lawyer.
   Some traders are probable defendants. Others may be concerned
about the prospect of civil lawsuits from investors who have lost
money in the futures markets and seek to blame their losses on
corrupt trading practices.
   Lawyers interviewed by the Tribune said the most likely defenses
would involve the fidelity of government tape-recordings secretly
made on noisy exchange floors, and questioning whether the FBI has
the expertise to spot crime in the futures business.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh indicated Sunday in
Washington that authorities were preparing to present evidence to a
grand jury.
   ``Obviously, I can't discuss in detail what's a pending
investigation,'' Thornburgh said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
``But the investigation is far-reaching, it is significant. ... We
will be gathering and submitting evidence to see if violations of
the federal criminal laws have occurred.''
   In the two-year probe, FBI agents posing as traders recorded
conversations that suggested some trades were rigged to prevent
customers from getting fair-market prices, and that some brokers
sent false reports to customers to hide the skimming of profits or
overcharges on commissions, the Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times have
said.
   Commodities exchanges are marketplaces in which buyers and
sellers essentially bet millions of dollars on the future prices of
goods ranging from gold to frozen orange juice.

<HEAD>Official Says Money Too Easy for Many Co-operatives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many cooperatives founded under a law to encourage
competition are finding it too easy to charge big prices and pay
high wages, and need to be controlled, a Kremlin official said
Monday.
   ``They make money without earning it by just raising prices,''
said Alexandra Biryukova, a candidate member of the ruling Communist
Party Politburo and a deputy premier.
   The government last month moved to cut cooperatives out of some
lucrative businesses such as medical services and video salons, and
is trying to control their prices.
   Mrs. Biryukova made her comments at a news conference as members
of cooperatives were preparing for conferences to provide a national
framework for their movement.
   A weekly newspaper reported last week that there are 48,500
cooperatives in the Soviet Union that employ more than 770,000
people. They produced about $4 billion in goods and services, or
about 1 percent of the national total, according to the newspaper
Arguments and Facts.
   Mrs. Biryukova, who oversees the production of consumer goods in
the official state-run economy, said in some cases cooperatives have
proven to be much less efficient than state-run enterprises.
   In the manufacture of clothing, the output per person in
cooperatives is six to seven times lower than that of state
enterprises, yet wages of co-op workers are two to three times
higher than the minimum for a state worker, she said.
   Permitted to exist outside the official economy to spur
efficiency and to fill holes in the range of products and services
provided by the official economy, the cooperatives have been free
from state price controls.
   ``Many state enterprises would like to be in the same situation
as cooperatives,'' she said.
   But earlier this month the Politburo called for the creation of
conditions that would improve the quality and output of goods
produced by cooperatives while bringing their prices closer to state
prices.
   For instance, the government now is seeking to bring the prices
at cooperative restaurants, among the most popular cooperative
ventures, down to the level of the best state-run restaurants, she
said.
   A meal at an expensive cooperative might cost about $32 to $48
per person, but would likely not exceed $16 at a state-run
restaurant.
   Mrs. Biryukova denied the state was trying to drive cooperatives
out of business, and said limitations on activities such as
providing medical services were meant to protect the public.
   Leaders of the cooperative movement said last week they doubted
the government would be able to put medical cooperatives and video
salons out of business. That would require officials to buy out the
co-ops' high initial investments and operating costs, they said.

   Here is the text of President Bush's remarks
Monday to a rally of anti-abortion protesters. Bush addressed the
group from the Oval Office through a telephone hookup that was piped
to the rally.
   Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is George Bush in the
Oval Office. And before you begin your march today on this first
Monday of my presidency, I wanted to take just a few brief moments
to restate my firm support of our cause, and to share with you my
deep personal concern about our American tragedy of
abortion-on-demand. We are concerned about abortion because it deals
with the lives of two human beings, mother and child. I know there
are people of good will who disagree, but after years of sober and
serious reflection on the issue, this is what I think. I think the
Supreme Court's decision in Roe versus Wade was wrong and should be
overturned. I think America needs a human life amendment. And I
think when it comes to abortion, there is a better way, the way of
adoption, the way of life.
   I know that this morning, several of your leaders had a meeting
in the White House with Vice President Quayle. I know, too, that you
and hundreds of thousands with you across the country have raised a
voice of moral gravity about abortion, a voice of principle, a voice
of faith, a full voice that properly asserts and affirms the basic
dignity of human life. I'm confident that more and more Americans
every year _ every day _ are hearing your message and taking it to
heart. And ladies and gentlemen, and yes, young people, as well, I
promise you that the president hears you now and stands with you in
a cause that must be won.
   Good bless you all, and God bless life.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of fans jammed the streets
and police reported about 90 arrests in a spontaneous outpouring of
jubilation over the San Francisco 49ers' last-minute Super Bowl
victory.
   In Cincinnati, which lost a 3-point lead with 34 seconds left in
the Bengals' second Super Bowl loss to the 49ers in seven years,
some fans cried, others shrugged as they left Fountain Square Plaza
and downtown bars Sunday night. All were quiet.
   The arrests in San Francisco were mostly related to alcohol, and
several windows were broken during the celebration, police Sgt.
Jerry Senkir said.
   Police also had a report of a single bullet from a handgun being
shot through a house window, said Officer Steve Ortiz, who wasn't
sure if the shot was related to the celebrations. No one was injured.
   Linda Beigel, waving a 49er pennant while leaning over police
barricades in the city's North Beach neighborhood, summed up the
evening's mood: ``We're letting everyone around here know we're the
world champions.''
   Interstate 480 was closed as were several major streets by police
because of reveling fans, some of whom climbed atop cars and
lampposts. Two cars were overturned on Mission Street, Senkir said.
   The 49ers defeated the Bengals 20-16 Sunday night after
quarterback Joe Montana hit John Taylor with a 10-yard touchdown
pass with 34 seconds remaining in the National Football League
championship game.
   Wide receiver Jerry Rice, who caught 12 passes for 222 yards,
both Super Bowl records, was named the game's most valuable player.
   Throughout the city, thousands of fans lined streets and hung
from car windows and the back of pickups, blowing horns, waving
banners and yelling.
   Market Street, the city's major thoroughfare, was jammed for
nearly 10 blocks as fans drove up and down, honking horns in
celebration.
   Emergency crews reported being swamped with calls about injuries.
   ``It's utter chaos in the city, and people are getting hurt,''
said paramedic Tina Hagopian, as she treated an unidentified man on
Broadway for bruises to the head and leg.
   Fireworks lit up the sky in the largely Hispanic Mission District
as fans erupted into the streets immediately after the victory over
the Bengals.
   ``We stomped them like bugs in a barn,'' said William Bernhard,
21, on a jammed Mission Street corner. ``For the last five minutes,
it was like having an electric eel attached to your spine.''
   Another man stood on Mission Street, holding a stuffed Bengal
tiger with a rope around its neck, occasionally tossing it under the
wheels of passing cars.
   Outside the jammed Mad Hatter sports bar on Geary Street,
hundreds of bellowing fans poured into the street after the game,
forcing officers to shut the street for nearly four hours.
   In Cincinnati, police reported no incidents following the game,
just disappointment.
   ``It was the same thing when we lost in 1982,'' Police Capt.
Robin Hochstrasser said of the previous Super Bowl loss the San
Francisco.

   Basque separatists said Monday they
would extend for two months their cease-fire on government targets
in return for talks on the northern region, a news report said.
   The statement published by Egin, a newspaper with separatist
sympathies, said the Basque separatist group ETA sought to establish
negotiations with the Spanish government in Algeria, where some ETA
leaders live in exile.
   Published reports say there have been informal contacts in
Algeria between government representatives and ETA members.
   ETA, which stands for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, seeks independence for the three-province Basque region.
It has killed more than 600 people in 20 years in pursuit of its
goal.
   The group said the cease-fire, declared Jan. 8, would run until
March 26, Basque National Day, the paper said.
   An Interior Ministry statement released later Monday said
governing officials were ``disposed to make the effort _ which could
be the last _ to see that dialogue leads the way to the definitive
disappearance of violent acts.''
   Government spokesman Miguel Gil said, ``It is always good news
when ETA stops killing.''

<HEAD>Congress Urged to Ignore `Notch' Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former chief actuary of the Social Security
System said Monday that raising the benefits paid to ``notch
babies'' _ millions of Americans born from 1917 through 1921 who
complain they have been treated unfairly _ would itself be an
inequity.
   Robert J. Myers, generally acknowledged as the nation's utmost
authority on Social Security, told Congress it should not pass
legislation to redress such complaints.
   The multibillion-dollar problem, a side-effect of major Social
Security bills in 1972 and 1977, refers to a situation in which two
retirees who worked the same number of years for the same wages can
receive different Social Security benefits just because they were
born a year or two apart.
   There are an estimated 7 million ``notch babies.''
   Myers, who chaired a private panel created to examine the
problem, told the Senate Finance subcommittee on Social Security:
   ``The real problem ... is that those persons who were born before
1917 (and) who worked well beyond age 62 after 1978 receive undue
windfalls. Those born after 1916 are equitably treated, consistent
with the intent of Congress, and receive proper benefit amounts.''
   Myers said there was no reason ``why younger workers should, over
the years, pay more taxes to provide windfall benefits to this
group.''
   And he said that, while ``there is a case for reducing ... the
windfall benefits for some persons born before 1917, this would not
now be equitable.''
   The congressional General Accounting Office and two organizations
representing millions of older Americans, the American Association
of Retired Persons and the National Council of Senior Citizens,
agreed with Myers.
   ``To focus on the unwarranted demands of one small group of
beneficiaries could threaten the fsical soundness of Social
Security, thereby affecting everyone,'' said Eugene Lehrmann of
Madison, Wis., vice chairman of AARP.
   A third group representing retirees disagreed. The National
Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare said the panel
chaired by Myers produced a biased report that gives Congress little
guidance on correcting the problem.
   ``We are concerned that you and your colleagues have
underestimated the damage to the integrity of the Social Security
system that the notch and the failure to correct it has caused,''
said Bruce Sumner, a director of the National Committee.
   The Myers commission was created by the National Academy for
Social Insurance, a non-profit, non-partisan group that says its
mission is to further knowledge of Social Security.
   Since the notch problem first came to light, dozens of bills have
been introduced in Congress to correct it. Some would cost the
Social Security trust fund as much as $200 billion over 10 years by
raising retirement benefits for those born from 1917 through 1921.
Others would reduce benefits of some recipients who were not born
during that period.
   The problem was created in 1977, when Congress cut back a
too-generous cost-of-living-allowance formula enacted in 1972. The
new formula was phased in and affected those born from 1917 through
1921.
   The most obvious result of the change was to give sometimes-large
benefit increases to people born in the years just before that
period. Many ``notch babies'' are upset that fellow retirees born a

<HEAD>Engine Supports Questioned as Part of Probe on Boeing Jet</HEAD>

   A jet whose engine fell off just after takeoff
last week from O'Hare International Airport had not gotten ordered
safety modifications on its engine mounts, officals said.
   The Piedmont Airlines Flight 1480 from O'Hare to Charlotte, N.C.,
was a Boeing 737-200, a type of aircraft which the Federal Aviation
Administration decided in November needed additional engine supports
after investigating a similar 1987 incident.
   However, the FAA order was not effective immediately and the
airline may have been within the allowed time lapse, said William
Bruce, who is heading an investigation of the Friday incident for
the National Transportation Safety Board. The Piedmont jet landed
safely after the engine fell in a field at the airport; no one was
injured.
   ``The modification had not been performed on this airplane,''
Bruce said at a press conference Saturday.
   Bruce said the November order said the supports could be added
anytime within the next 4,000 landings. He said he did not believe
the aircraft had made that many landings since the order was issued.
   Friday's incident was the second one of its type in 13 months.
   Last January, the FAA ordered airlines to inspect some
engine-mount bolts on 737-200s for cracks after an engine fell off a
USAir flight shortly after takeoff from Philadelphia on Dec. 5,
1987, said Mitch Barker, an FAA spokesman in Seattle.
   The Boeing 737-200 has two engines, one mounted under each wing.
The plane, which can carry about 125 passengers, is also designed to
fly on one engine, said David Shipley, a spokesman for USAir Inc,
which owns Piedmont.
   The pilots in both incidents were able to land the planes with
the one remaining engine and no injuries were reported.

   French archaeologists in southern Iraq have
unearthed a statue and fragments of a grave marker dating back to
the Babylonian era nearly 2,500 years ago, a government newspaper
said.
   The statue of a praying man was found at Larsa, where French
researchers have been digging since the early 1930s, the
English-language Baghdad Observer reported.
   The object could shed light on the religious life of the ancient
city at the site, the paper quoted French team leader Daniel Forest
as saying.
   Forest said the statue will be valuable to researchers even
though it's damaged, the newspaper said.
   The Babylonian era extended from 626-539 B.C. when Larsa was one
of the major cities of the region.

<TEXT>
   A court on Monday ordered the arrest of a
Turk accused of acting as go-between in the illegal sale of kidneys
for use in transplants at a London hospital, a prosecutor said.
   State prosecutor Sait Erem also said he was investigating whether
one patient's kidney was removed by the London hospital without his
knowledge.
   Erem told The Associated Press he sought the arrest of Tunc Ay
Kunter after details of the case were discussed Sunday in a
nationwide television show.
   In the program, an unidentified woman and man each said they had
sold one of their kidneys through a middleman to recipients at a
hospital. They named neither the hospital nor the middleman.
   They said one kidney was sold for $5,600 and the other for $3,200.
   The prosecutor said he was told Kunter received payments as high
as $48,380 from kidney recipients.
   He said Kunter confessed in earlier questioning to acting as
middleman but also professed humanitarian motives.
   Erem also said he told health officials in Agri province in
eastern Turkey to check the claim of a Turk, Ahmet Koc, who says one
of his kidneys was removed at the private Wellington Humana hospital
in London without his knowledge.
   He said he was investigating the cases of three other Turks who
allegedly sold their kidneys at Humana hospital through Kunter.
   The London hospital said it had no evidence confirming the
allegations. The British government, however, has announced its own
investigation, and the hospital said it was reviewing its procedures
for organ transplants.
   Mustafa Dursun Ozsaglam, head of the Association of Organ
Transplant Patients, also appeared on the TV broadcast. He said such
organ sales have carried out within Turkey but gave no details.
   Turkish law allows donation of human organs but forbids their
sale. Sellers, organizers or recipients could receive prison terms
of up to four years.
   Erem did not say if the investigation would lead to prosecution
of the people who sold their kidneys.

   The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee today
approved the nomination of Richard Darman to be President Bush's
budget director, paving the way for a full Senate vote on Wednesday.
   The committee voted 9-0 for Darman to be director of the White
House's Office of Management and Budget.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the committee's chairman, said he knew
of nothing that would prevent the Senate from confirming Darman.
   Darman, 45, is a former investment banker, deputy Treasury
secretary and White House aide.
   Darman refused to provide specific information on how the deficit
would be reduced in the fiscal 1990 budget that Bush plans to
present to Congress on Feb. 9.
   ``I have what amounts to an extemely long laundry list of
possibilities,'' Darman told the lawmakers. ``Almost everything on
the laundry list is unattractive to some constitutency.''
   The only hint of detail Darman would provide was to repeat
earlier promises by Bush that Social Security _ which totals nearly
one-fifth of the $l.1 trillion federal budget _ would not be cut,
and that there will be no new taxes.
   ``We are firm, and have to be, on the no new taxes point,''
Darman said.
   The Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law requires a deficit next year
of no more than $100 billion. The administration says that without
any savings, the imbalance will be $127 billion.

<TEXT>
   Armed civilians seized a small
military base near the capital today, and at least six people were
killed before soldiers were able to retake most of the facility,
news reports and officials said.
   The civilian attackers stormed the base carried pamphlets
supporting officers who have led three previous uprisings, the
private news agency Diario y Noticias said.
   Soldiers firing tank shells, mortars and heavy machine guns
regained control of most of the base a few hours later but held off
on a final assault because of concerns some hostages were being held
inside, the state-run Telam news agency said, quoting unidentified
military sources.
   Soldiers and Buenos Aires provincial police backed by tanks
reportedly surrounded several buildings where the civilian fighters
were holed up.
   Under a hazy summer sun, two small tanks opened the noon
counterattack, firing on the officers' club in which the civilians
were thought to be isolated, Telam said. Sporadic shooting continued
several hours.
   Provincial government and police sources said four soldiers were
killed and eight soldiers or police wounded. At least two civilian
fighters were killed, DyN reported.
   Earlier news reports said three civilians and two police were
killed. It was not clear if the later reports included these
casualties.
   The Ministry of Defense, anticipating a possible fourth
insurrection against the government in the past 21 months, bolstered
defenses at Government House and the official residence of President
Raul Alfonsin, Telam said.
   The civilian president spoke by telephone with Defense Minister
Horacio Jaunarena and Army Chief Gen. Francisco Gassino and told
them to retake the base, presidential press secretary Jose Ignacio
Lopez told reporters.
   Buenos Aires provincial police surrounded it, began to evacuate
nearby residents, and took up firing positions in private homes.
   The incident comes less than two months after a short-lived
barracks insurrection to protest Alfonsin's treatment of the
military.
   The seizure occurred at the 3rd Infantry Regiment at La Tablada,
12 miles northwest of the capital, Buenos Aires.
   Defense Ministry officials made no comment and the precise number
of civilians involved or soldiers at the base was not known.
   The attack began about 3 a.m., when civilians threw several small
explosive devices onto the base compound, DyN reported.
   Employees at a nearby gas station said that at about 6:15 a.m.,
civilians in a truck crashed through the regiment's main gate, DyN
said. Six cars followed.
   A total of 40 to 50 men and women dressed in civilian clothes
were in the truck and cars, news agencies reported. Police put the
number at about 30.
   According to DyN, as they entered the base, the civilians threw
pamphlets supporting what is known as the ``New Argentine Army'' of
Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, who led short-lived army uprisings in April 1987
and January 1988. Rico was dismissed and now is in prison.
   Other pamphlets read ``Long Live Rico!'' and ``Long Live
Seineldin!'' DyN reported. Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin led a four-day
uprising in December. He also is in prison.
   The base was almost empty at the time of the attack, the news
agencies reported. They said most officers and non-commissioned men
had left for the weekend and had not returned.
   The December insurrection began after officers at several army
bases, including La Tablada, tried to incite troops. Seineldin
surrendered four days later.
   The only clashes reported during that insurrection were between
troops and civilians, many of whom harbor animosity toward the
military.
   On Friday, President Alfonsin told a news conference that
factions within the army still are angry over issues such as the
prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the
1976-83 military dictatorship, which he was elected in 1983 to
replace.
   ``I affirm categorically that those factions are not going to
have the possibilities to triumph,'' Alfonsin said. ``But I should
say with absolute seriousness that I am not in the position of
assuring with the same force and certainty that there will not be
other episodes.''

   Emergency crews were dispatched twice when two jets
reported trouble at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in
separate incidents, but but both planes landed safely, officials
said.
   A Braniff Airways Boeing 737, carrying 51 passengers and five
crew members, returned to the airport about 12:30 p.m. Sunday after
it began to lose cabin pressure, said Wendell Glenn, assistant
manager of Braniff's DFW office.
   Flight 548 had left for Kansas City about a half-hour earlier.
The flight landed safely and passengers were rerouted to other
flights.
   Glenn said passengers had to breathe through oxygen masks during
the descent. Glenn said federal investigators had not determined the
cause of the pressure loss, but there is ``a possibility'' the plane
had a faulty seal in its front cargo door.
   Later that afternoon, a Pan American Boeing 737 arriving from
Miami reported a possible fire in an auxiliary power unit. But
officials later determined Flight 573, arriving shortly after 5
p.m., had a faulty warning indicator light.
   Pan Am spokesman Jeff Kriendler said the plane landed safely and
was returned to service Sunday night.

<HEAD>Leaders Say US Allies Should Increase Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. allies, especially Japan, should raise
their defense spending even as the United States throttles back from
recent rises in the growth rate of its defense budget, says a
private group that includes three former defense secretaries and
President Bush's national security adviser.
   ``Japan clearly should increase its expenditures on international
security, but those increases should lie principally in economic
assistance and in support of the costs of U.S. forces in Japan,''
they said, adding:
   ``Realistic expectations are that at most (U.S.) defense spending
will remain flat for the foreseeable future.''
   The bipartisan group included former secretaries of defense
Harold Brown, Melvin Laird and James Schlesinger as well as former
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, financier Felix Rohatyn and Brent
Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser.
   Their recommendations were published recently under the title
``Building a New Consensus'' by the School of Advanced International
Studies (SAIS) of the Johns Hopkins University in the semi-annual
``SAIS Review.''
   Brown, who like Vance served under President Carter, is chairman
of the group. Laird and Schlesinger served under President Nixon.
Rohatyn is also a member of the 14-member National Economic
Commission due to make a a major report to Bush and Congress by
March 1.
   Brown's group suggested that the United States will have to
increase federal revenues to adequately meet its commitments.
   ``Adequate resources exist to provide both necessary social
services and an adequate defense, but it serves no constructive
purpose to pretend that sacrifices are unncessary to secure them or
that the American people can get deficit reduction, adequate
defense, increased social spending and tax reduction all at the same
time,'' they said.

   A man who said he posed as an American Indian
because he was fascinated by their culture actually thought Indian
women should be killed, a prosecutor said Monday in opening
arguments for a triple murder trial.
   But a lawyer for Billy Glaze, charged in the deaths of three
American Indian women, questioned whether one person killed all
three women and said Glaze was charged only because of pressure on
the Police Department.
   ``This case is about three young, sad troubled lives, three
vulnerable women, all of whom had their lives taken, their lives
snuffed out, abbreviated by the violent senseless action of their
killer,'' Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Judith Hawley said in
her opening statement.
   Hawley said prosecutors would present evidence that Glaze
admitted killing the women in a note to a fellow prisoner that said:
``I killed them. I was mad at them.''
   Witnesses will testify that Glaze hated American Indian women and
thought they should be raped and killed, she said.
   Defense lawyer Michael J. Colich questioned the reliability of
prosecution witnesses and the length of time between Glaze's
identification as a suspect and his indictment.
   Glaze, 44, is charged with murder in the deaths of three women
from July 1986 to April 1987. He is being held in lieu of $2 million
bail.
   Police believe the three victims met their killer in bars. Their
bodies were mutilated and posed in suggestive positions after their
deaths.
   All 12 of the police department's homicide detectives were put on
the case when the third body was discovered.
   Investigators identified Glaze as their prime suspect months
before he was indicted June 14. Authorities said they were hampered
initially by a lack of hard evidence and potential witnesses who
wouldn't cooperate, used aliases or had no addresses.
   ``There has been a lot of time spent on the (police)
investigation _ not necessarily that they've turned up a lot because
of that time,'' said attorney Peter Cahill, Colich's co-counsel.
``From the very beginning, Billy Glaze has always denied any
involvement with any of the deaths.''
   Glaze is believed to have left Minneapolis around May 1, 1987.
   He was arrested May 24, 1987, on a drunken driving charge in New
Mexico. Albuquerque police contacted Minneapolis authorities when
they learned Glaze was sought for questioning in the three killings.
   Albuquerque authorities said Glaze's truck contained a
blood-stained shirt, a bloody nightstick and strands of human hair
stuck to a crowbar.
   From Albuquerque, Glaze was transferred to Dallas for violating
conditions of his parole from a 1974 rape conviction. Shortly before
he was to be released in December 1987, federal officials in
Minneapolis charged him with two counts of Social Security fraud.
   A grand jury that heard testimony from 50 witnesses deliberated
less than an hour before indicting Glaze. Two weeks later he was
convicted of the fraud charges and sentenced to two years in prison
and five years probation.
   Glaze once told a television reporter that he had claimed to be
an Indian because their culture fascinated him, and federal
authorities said he used aliases including Jesse Settingcrow and
Jesse Sitting Crow.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Customs Service said Monday it seized
almost 23 tons of cocaine in the past three months, including drugs
hidden in shipments of beeswax and anchovies.
   The 45,530 pounds of cocaine seized between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31
was 11,276 pounds more than in the same period one year earlier, an
increase of about one-third, said Customs spokesman Dennis Shimkoski.
   ``A lot of it is coming in by ship,'' he said. ``Sometimes it's
in hollowed-out lumber. We've found it in shipments of beeswax,
fruit pulp, industrial gear boxes, anchovies and false walls of
containers.''
   Shimkoski said sometimes bags of cocaine were secreted in huge
containers of items such as fruit pulp, but other times the
substance was just mixed in with the legitimate cargo and would have
to be cooked out later.
   ``With the technology that they use, the sky's the limit on what
they'll try next,'' he said.
   Cocaine inside chocolates, bulk lumber and wooden boards in
containers came from Central and South America last year. Those
three shipments together yielded more than 20,000 pounds of cocaine,
he said.
   The cocaine in the beeswax and other bulk cargo was found through
the automated commercial system, in which computers compare cargo
manifests to find ``who the high-risk importers might be, or the
high-risk imports,'' Shimkoski said.
   For the entire 1988 fiscal year, which ended last Sept. 30,
Customs officers found a record 138,808 pounds of cocaine, up from
87,898 pounds in fiscal 1987 and 52,521 pounds in fiscal 1986, he
said.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration has estimated that cocaine
production overseas _ Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador are main
producers _ is decreasing in fiscal 1989.
   This would mean, said DEA spokesman Maurice Hill, that the big
increase in seizures by Customs in the first quarter of fiscal 1989
reflected an actual cut in the amount of cocaine coming in, not just
a cut in a much larger supply.
   ``Without a doubt,'' it's a cut in imports, Hill said. ``But you
realize with the numbers we're dealing with, it's not a dent.''
   Meanwhile, the Customs Service's 21 international mail branches
seized record quantities of other drugs _ heroin, opium and
marijuana, Shimkoski said.
   Those branches seized 164 pounds of heroin last year, compared
with just 23 pounds in fiscal 1987, he said. Meanwhile, opium
seizures increased from 1,019 pounds to 1,600 pounds, and marijuana
seizures increased from 1,141 to 1,310 pounds.

   ``Miami-Vice'' star Don Johnson is a dream to
work with, say some of his leading ladies, including his ex- and
future wife Melanie Griffith.
   Judith Ivey, Sheena Easton and Olivia Brown join Miss Griffith in
the Jan. 28 issue of TV Guide in praise of Johnson.
   ``We got married when I was 18 and he was 26,'' Miss Griffith
said. ``Even after we got divorced, we were good friends. We always
remained in contact and then I did an episode of `Miami Vice.'''
   Working with Johnson ``was wonderful because Don directed that
episode,'' Miss Griffith said. When the on-screen kissing stopped,
the love scenes moved off camera.
   ``I don't know if I ever fell out of love with him,'' she said.
   Miss Ivey said she's grateful to Johnson for getting her the part
on NBC's ``The Long Hot Summer'' in 1985.
   ``I can't say (the network) didn't want me, but they were hoping
(for) someone with a bigger name.''
   Miss Easton, who played the woman Sonny Crocket fell in love with
and married last season, said Johnson led her ``step by step through
each scene and familiarized me with the process of acting.''
   Miss Brown said that when her father came to Miami, she asked
Johnson to recommend a restaurant.
   ``When we got there, Don had arranged to pay the bill and he had
ordered a $200 bottle of wine for us,'' she said, adding that
Johnson stopped by the restaurant. ``My dad left thinking that he
was the greatest.''

   Sylvester Stallone may be committed to star in
five action movies in the next six years, but he says he is getting
tired of ``the same old hop, skip, jump.''
   The movies have earned him millions, ``but I haven't been able to
say, OK, I'll coast,'' he told Esquire in its February issue.
Included in his movie commitments is a fifth ``Rocky'' and a fourth
``Rambo.''
   The actor said he refuses to ``accept that I've fallen into a
genre that has presented me as a kind of myth, a semi-real
character, and just say, that's the way it is, the die has been
cast, that's our mold, go with it, churn out your movies, take the
money and run.''
   Stallone said he's hoping to get a more subtle script _ possibly
``La Brava,'' by Elmore Leonard, based on Leonard's book.
   ``I couldn't be more exposed to ridicule than I've already
been,'' Stallone said.
   Esquire described Stallone's reaction to a script offered him by
director William Friedkin, which starts with a helicopter chase.
   ``This is just too safe,'' Stallone told Friedkin. ``I'm on
autopilot here. I really think that people _ and I would, too _ will
say, `Oh, I know how this turns out. He takes on 50 guys and wins.
Let's go see something else.' It's so right, Billy, it's wrong.''

   Former Miami Dolphins running back Eugene
``Mercury'' Morris, who was convicted on cocaine charges in 1982,
said Monday that just saying no will not curb America's appetite for
drugs.
   ``Telling people not to do drugs because they're bad, something
done by the `Just Say No' program, is not the answer,'' Morris said.
``Drugs are neither bad nor good, the choice to use them is. A cliff
is not dangerous unless you jump off.''
   The ``Just Say No'' program was created by former first lady
Nancy Reagan to encourage children to steer clear of drugs.
   Morris, a veteran of three Super Bowls, served three years of a
20-year prison term on cocaine conspiracy, trafficking and
possession charges before he was released in 1986. Since his
release, Morris has spent much of his time giving anti-drug speeches
at churches, schools and conventions.
   Morris was in Maine to speak at the third annual Alcohol
Awareness Week at Bowdoin College.

   In the magazine's Jan. 28 issue, the editors said the Most
Titilating Trend is the rise of tabloid television, such as that by
Geraldo Rivera, Oprah Winfrey, Morton Downey Jr., Maury Povich's ``A
Current Affair,'' and Fox's ``The Reporters.''
   Sajak, who has a new talk show on CBS in addition to his
game-show gig, is the one to Keep Your Eye On because he is as
charming and witty as Johnny Carson and David Letterman, the
magazine said.
   White got the award for Wheely Bad Acting for her role in NBC's
``The Goddess of Love.''
   The Saddest Sight was sitcom hall-of-famers Dick Van Dyke and
Mary Tyler Moore flopping in their latest comeback attempts, the
magazine said.

   Armed civilians seized a small
military base near the capital today, and up to 24 people were
killed or wounded before soldiers firing tanks shells, mortars and
machine guns retook most of the base, news reports and officials
said.
   The civilian attackers who stormed the base carried pamphlets
supporting officers who have led three previous uprisings, the
private news agency Diario y Noticias said.
   ``Militarily, the situation at the 3rd infantry regiment at La
Tablada is dominated,'' the secretary for state intelligence,
Facundo Suarez, told the government news agency Telam about 10 hours
after the incident began.
   He admitted, however, that some civilian attackers remained
inside, and gunfire could be heard coming from the base as he spoke
on the radio.
   DyN quoted a military source it did not identify as saying at
least 20 of the estimated 50 civilian attackers were killed or
wounded during fighting.
   Hospital officials said at least four soldiers were killed and 12
wounded in the fighting, along with one reporter.
   Two small tanks opened the noon counterattack, firing on the
officers' club in which the civilians were thought to be isolated,
Telam said. Sporadic shooting continued several hours.
   The Ministry of Defense, anticipating a possible fourth
insurrection against the government in the past 21 months, bolstered
defenses at Government House and the official residence of President
Raul Alfonsin, Telam said.
   The civilian president spoke by telephone with Defense Minister
Horacio Jaunarena and Army Chief Gen. Francisco Gassino and told
them to retake the base, presidential press secretary Jose Ignacio
Lopez told reporters.
   Buenos Aires provincial police surrounded it, began to evacuate
nearby residents, and took up firing positions in private homes.
   The incident comes less than two months after a short-lived
barracks insurrection to protest Alfonsin's treatment of the
military.
   The seizure occurred at the 3rd Infantry Regiment at La Tablada,
12 miles northwest of the capital, Buenos Aires.
   Defense Ministry officials made no comment and the precise number
of civilians involved or soldiers at the base was not known.
   The attack began about 3 a.m., when civilians threw several small
explosive devices onto the base compound, DyN reported.
   Employees at a nearby gas station said that at about 6:15 a.m.,
civilians in a truck crashed through the regiment's main gate, DyN
said. Six cars followed.
   A total of 40 to 50 men and women dressed in civilian clothes
were in the truck and cars, news agencies reported. Police put the
number at about 30.
   According to DyN, as they entered the base, the civilians threw
pamphlets supporting what is known as the ``New Argentine Army'' of
Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, who led short-lived army uprisings in April 1987
and January 1988. Rico was dismissed and now is in prison.
   Other pamphlets read ``Long Live Rico!'' and ``Long Live
Seineldin!'' DyN reported. Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin led a four-day
uprising in December. He also is in prison.
   The base was almost empty at the time of the attack, the news
agencies reported. They said most officers and non-commissioned men
had left for the weekend and had not returned.
   The December insurrection began after officers at several army
bases, including La Tablada, tried to incite troops. Seineldin
surrendered four days later.
   The only clashes reported during that insurrection were between
troops and civilians, many of whom harbor animosity toward the
military.
   On Friday, President Alfonsin told a news conference that
factions within the army still are angry over issues such as the
prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the
1976-83 military dictatorship, which he was elected in 1983 to
replace.
   ``I affirm categorically that those factions are not going to
have the possibilities to triumph,'' Alfonsin said. ``But I should
say with absolute seriousness that I am not in the position of
assuring with the same force and certainty that there will not be
other episodes.''

   STARKE, Fla. AP) _ Convicted murderer Ted Bundy, facing execution
in less than 24 hours for the slaying of a Florida schoolgirl, met
with his attorneys and a psychiatrist today and was in a ``subdued''
mood, a prison official said.
   Bundy's attorneys also filed a last-ditch appeal with the U.S.
Supreme Court, where they were turned down last week.
   The convicted murderer's appointment with a psychiatrist today
generated speculation that the suspect in up to three dozen slayings
will try to halt his execution through a competency claim.
   Today, his attorneys also filed an appeal with Florida Circuit
Judge John Peach in Lake City, arguing that a 1980 trial jury
received improper instructions about their role in Bundy's
sentencing. Peach rejected the appeal, according to Larry Spaulding,
director of the office of the Capital Collateral Representative, the
state agency that represents death row inmates.
   Bundy's attorneys then notified the Florida Supreme Court that it
would be asked to consider the argument, said Court Clerk Sid White.
   The appeal was filed today after Gov. Bob Martinez late Sunday
reaffirmed his vow ``that he has no intention of delaying the
execution beyond Tuesday morning,'' said Jon Peck, the governor's
press secretary.
   Bundy is scheduled for execution at Florida State Prison on
Tuesday for the 1978 rape and murder of a 12-year-old Lake City
girl, one of three people Bundy killed in Florida. Bunday is under
his fourth death warrant.
   Meanwhile, Bundy has confessed to 20 killings in four Western
states, officials said.
   Bundy planned to meet this afternoon with representatives of the
Colorado State Attorney General's office to discuss murders in that
state, said Bob MacMaster, prison spokesman. Bundy also was to meet
with California TV minister James Dobson, MacMaster said.
   During the past four days, Bundy has admitted killing 20 young
women in Washington, Utah, Idaho and Colorado, authorities said.
   Salt Lake County sheriff's Detective Dennis Couch said Sunday
night that Bundy mentioned his involvement in up to eight Utah
killings, at least two more than authorities had believed.
   Earlier Sunday, Bundy confessed to two murders in Idaho, where
officials had never linked him to any killings.
   He also provided investigators Friday and Saturday with details
of eight Washington killings and one in Colorado for which he has
long been suspected but never charged, authorities said. They said
he provided details of a Colorado killing in which he had been
charged.
   Colorado Attorney General Duane Woodard criticized Bundy's new
cooperation, accusing the killer of stringing along investigators to
avoid execution.
   Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said Bundy was a
``conniver,'' but that his tactics wouldn't work this time.
   Woodard, who discussed Bundy confessions at length with
Washington state Attorney General Ken Eikenberry on Saturday night,
said Bundy has failed to give investigators from either state much
new information.
   ``He picks out one woman in Colorado and one woman in Washington
state just to whet the appetite of law enforcement,'' said Woodard,
who called Bundy's 11th-hour statements a ``hoax.''
   ``I am disappointed that, in his closing hours when he had the
opportunity to inform authorities of the whereabouts of bodies, he
didn't do it.''
   In addition to the appeal to the Supreme Court, Bundy's attorneys
also could ask Martinez for a stay on grounds that Bundy wouldn't
understand the charges against him or the severity of the sentence
at the time of execution.
   ``If and when that claim is raised, it would require the governor
to stay the execution and appoint a team of three psychiatrists to
interview Bundy, which we are fully prepared to do if the need
arises,'' Peck said.
   ``The key here is timing, but the end result will be the same. It
could slow down the process, but the sentence is going to be carried
out and it's going to be carried out very soon.
   ``I guess they figure it ain't over till it's over.''
   Bundy's attorneys worked late Sunday.
   Bundy, who has been on death row at the prison since July 1979
and survived three death warrants, lost an appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court a week ago, and no other court has offered a reprieve.
   If all appeals fail, final preparations for execution would begin
tonight.
   In Tacoma, Wash., where Bundy was raised, word of the confessions
shocked his mother, Louise.
   ``If Ted did do these things, and if indeed he is substantiating
it with facts that he really did those things ... oh ... it's the
most devastating news of our lives,'' she said, shaking her head and
sighing as her husband, John, sat silently across the room.
   Thomas Leach, whose 12-year-old daughter, Kimberly, was Bundy's
last victim, doubted the execution would proceed, saying, ``They
ain't going to do nothing.''
   But Kimberly's uncle, Frank Fender, has asked to attend the
execution despite state policy barring victims' relatives as
witnesses.
   ``I want to look in his eyes and see him before they put the hood
on,'' Fender said, referring to the dark hood placed over an
inmate's shaven head just before electrocution.
   Brian Ballard, the governor's chief of operations, said the
governor's office planned to talk with Fender. However, he said, the
rules wouldn't be set aside to accommodate witness requests.

<HEAD>Meat Industry Asks Delay in Precooked-Patties Rule Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A meat industry association said Monday it has
asked the Agriculture Department to delay proposed changes in
regulations designed to ensure the safety of certain kinds of meat
patties, including precooked hamburgers.
   The American Meat Institute said in a letter to the department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service that the 30-day public comment
period allowed by the Dec. 27 proposal was not enough ``to
appropriately address the specifics'' of the proposed rule change.
   In announcing the proposal, agency administrator Lester M.
Crawford had said there had been ``increasing evidence over the past
several years that food-borne pathogens survive in products that
many consumers erroneously consider to be fully cooked.''
   Crawford said the products include such items ``Char-Broiled Beef
Patties'' and ``Pre-Browned Fresh Pork Sausage Patties.''
   Recently, he said, a bacterial strain was linked to an outbreak
of food poisoning which hospitalized six Minnesota school children
with severe diarrhea and cramps.
   Crawford said the Centers for Disease Control determined that
undercooked beef patties caused the illness, although the specific
bacterial strain that infected the children has not been isolated
from the patties.
   The proposed rule would establish requirements for the storage of
raw ingredients, processing times and temperatures, handling to
prevent contamination after processing, and labels that include
cooking instruction for final preparation.
   Crawford said that a label for partially cooked ground meat
patties, for example, would bear the statement, ``Partially Cooked:
For Safety, Cook Until Well Done (Internal Temperature of 160 F).''
   George D. Wilson, the meat institute's vice president of science
and prepared meats, said in the letter to the federal agency that
``contrary to suggestions in the proposal, AMI fails to see the
grounds for associating a public health emergency with the
production and consumption of precooked meat patties.''
   Wilson said the Agriculture Department laboratory tests ``did not
confirm the presence'' of the specific bacteria implicated in the
Minnesota incident.
   Wilson said the institute believes the proposal ``was hastily
prepared using an associated, but inappropriate, data base resulting
in a proposed regulation which is a product safety `overkill' and is
commercially impractical.''

<TEXT>
   This year's March for Life to protest legalized
abortion comes at a time when the Supreme Court is considering new
limits on the constitutional right it granted women 16 years ago.
   And although what ``pro-choice'' forces term a woman's right to
control her body may not be in jeopardy, ``pro-life'' forces are
hoping the court will significantly dent what they call abortion on
demand.
   Removed from, but not unaware of, the political battle being
waged outside its stately edifice, the court is studying a Missouri
law that makes abortions more difficult to obtain in that state.
   Lower courts invalidated the law, and state officials want it
reinstated. If the law runs afoul of the court's landmark Roe vs.
Wade decision legalizing abortion, says the Missouri appeal under
study, it's the 1973 ruling that should give way.
   Arguments in the case will be heard sometime in the spring, and a
decision is expected by July.
   Over the years _ most recently in 1983 and in 1986 _ the court
has resisted state attempts to add muscle to their
abortion-regulating powers. Some of the invalidated measures are
similar to those proposed in Missouri.
   But the court's membership has changed since its last major
ruling on abortion rights, adding new drama _ and the potential for
a differing result _ to the Missouri case.
   Many constitutional law experts predict the current court will
not retreat from its 1973 finding that women have a fundamental
constitutional right, based on privacy, to end their pregnancies.
   But those experts say the justices may be willing to alter the
1973 guidelines dictating how state and local governments may
interfere with that right. At stake is the scope of availability of
legal abortions, which now number about 1.5 million a year.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White
dissented from the Roe vs. Wade ruling and several subsequent
abortion decisions.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has questioned the reasoning of the
1973 ruling.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, who has not yet voted in an abortion
decision since being named to the court by then-President Reagan in
1986, is thought to favor overturning or curtailing Roe vs. Wade.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, another Reagan appointee who joined
the court last February, likewise has not participated in an
abortion case. His views on Roe vs. Wade are not known.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
and John Paul Stevens are seen as staunch supporters of the 1973
decision and the trimester-by-trimester approach it took in limiting
governmental regulation of abortion.
   The decision said a woman's decision to have an abortion during
the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her
doctor.
   It said states may interfere in the abortion decision during the
second trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may take
steps only to protect fetal life in the third trimester. State
authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester was not
made absolute, however.
   The justices knew the trimester approach they adopted was in many
respects arbitrary, according to internal court memoranda unearthed
and published this week by The Washington Post.
   Blackmun, author of the 1973 decision, told a law school audience
last September that Roe vs. Wade could be overturned this year.
   ``There's a very distinct possibility that it will _ this term.
You can count the votes,'' he said.
   For Blackmun, the continuing controversy generated by the 1973
decision has become a personal, emotional matter. His statement
therefore may be discounted as something less than an actual
prediction.
   But the court's decision in the Missouri case, whether or not it
disturbs Roe vs. Wade, is destined to become, at least temporarily,
the new watershed in what likely is a never-ending debate over
abortion.

   President Bush told tens of thousands of
demonstrators today that abortion on demand is an ``American
tragedy'' and said he favors reversal of the landmark Supreme Court
decision legalizing it.
   Speaking by telephone hookup to activists gathered near the White
House on the 16th anniversary of the historic Roe vs. Wade decision,
Bush said he believes that ruling ``was wrong and should be
overturned.''
   The new president made the call shortly after Vice President Dan
Quayle also assured anti-abortion leaders that the new
administration supports their cause.
   ``I wanted to share with you my deep personal concern about our
American tragedy _ abortion on demand,'' Bush said.
   ``I think America needs a human life amendment and I think when
it comes to abortion, there's a better way _ the way of adoption,
the way of life,'' he said, adding:
   ``I'm confident that more and more Americans every year _ every
day _ are hearing your message and taking it to heart. I promise you
that the president hears you now and stands with you in a cause that
must be won. God bless you all and God bless life.''
   Although the protestors cheered Bush with enthusiasm, Nellie Gray
of the March for Life, an organizer of the rally, cautioned the
crowd on the Ellipse, off the White House grounds, that although
they could see the White House and hear Bush he could not hear them.
   ``Unfortunately the White House staff chose to put in a one-way
communications line,'' she said. ``He spoke to us but he could not
hear us. That was not an adequate way to deal with our pro-life
march.''
   Former President Reagan followed the same practice as Bush in
past years.
   U.S. Park Police estimated that 67,000 people attended the rally,
held in sunny, mild weather.
   Talking to anti-abortion leaders earlier, Quayle noted that ``I
have been involved with a lot of people in my state (Indiana) on
this issue. I couldn't think of a more appropriate group to be
meeting with.''
   The noontime rally and a march to Capitol Hill culminated a
series of nationwide protests against the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion.
   John C. Willke, president of the National Right to Life
Committee, told reporters earlier that a non-sectarian campaign of
prayer is needed ``to help stop today's holocaust.''
   Willke gave no details, saying individuals will have to work out
what is comfortable for them.
   ``All we can do is plant a seed and call for it,'' he said. ``But
I see tens of thousands of pastors ... tens of thousands points of
light on a prayer crusade.''
   Quayle said he was delighted to sit down ``with various
constituencies interested in the preservation of life.''
   When a reporter asked whether the Bush administration could
succeed in getting the Roe vs. Wade decision reversed, Quayle
replied, ``Time will tell. We have the same commitment.'' He said it
was important that someone stand up and speak for ``those people who
are not yet born.''
   White House chief of staff John Sununu accompanied Quayle to the
meeting, and the vice president said Sununu was there because he
wanted to hear the visitors' views.
   Willke said he had no problem meeting with the vice president
instead of the president and said he believes Bush ``will probably
walk in Ronald Reagan's mocassins on this issue.''
   Leonard Dinegar of the National Right to Life Committee said
organizers hoped to match last year's turnout of 50,000 people for
what has become an annual reminder of the divisive issue.
   The debate has taken on added intensity this year, with a
reconstituted Supreme Court considering a Missouri case with the
potential to result in significant changes in the legal doctrine
governing abortion.
   The Washington protest capped a series of demonstrations marking
the 16th anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade decision declaring that
women's privacy rights allow them to make their own decisions on
abortion.
   Anti-abortion demonstrators marched by the thousands in numerous
cities on Sunday, in some cases confronted by advocates of free
choice in abortion.
   More than 500 opponents of abortion were met at a Planned
Parenthood office in Burlington, Vt., by 40 pro-choice demonstrators.
   The two sides faced each other from across the street, with each
group singing, clapping and maintaining their distance.
   ``Right-to-life is not a political issue,'' said Bishop John
Marshall, the leader of Vermont's Catholic diocese. ``It is not a
matter for the politicians to decide. It is a religious and moral
issue already decided by God.''
   In downtown Pittsburgh, about 1,200 pro-choice marchers joined a
``March For Women's Lives.'' They were met at the Allegheny County
morgue by about 40 anti-abortion marchers.
   The pro-choice march was preceded by a rally at which Eleanor
Smeal, a former National Organization for Women president, said,
``Some people want to save their souls by spilling the blood of
innocent women. That isn't Christianity. It's hypocrisy. The church
has no business dictating the policies of this country.''
   After her remarks, many in the crowd turned, shook their fingers
and yelled, ``Shame, shame, shame'' at the anti-abortion protesters,
who stood across the street.
   The Supreme Court has agreed to review a Missouri case in which a
lower federal court struck down a stringent state anti-abortion law
as unconstitutional. In its appeal, the state urged reversal of Roe
vs. Wade, and the Reagan administration filed a brief calling the
Missouri case an ``appropriate opportunity'' to reconsider the Jan.
22, 1973, decision.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh expressed hope on Sunday that
the high court, with the addition of new Reagan appointee Anthony
Kennedy, will use the Missouri case to overturn Roe vs. Wade.

<TEXT>
   The yellow ribbon that adorned a White House
door for more than three years in memory of American hostages is
gone, and President Bush's spokesman said Monday no one seems to
know what happened to it.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the absence of the
ribbon does not reflect any lack of concern by the new president for
the fate of the hostages held in the Middle East.
   Fitzwater said the ribbon was affixed to the entrance to the West
Wing of the White House by President Reagan's secretary Kathleen
Osborne. He said he did not know whether she or anyone else from
Reagan's staff took it down.
   But, he said, ``President Bush's concern for the hostages is
strong and is a problem that is continually in his thoughts and in
his planning.''
   Osborne works for Reagan now that the former president has
retired to California but she was not in Monday, said Reagan's
spokesman Mark Weinberg. Weinberg said he did not know what had
happened to the ribbon.
   The ribbon was given to Reagan by families of the hostages held
by extremists in Lebanon, and Osborne placed it on the door in
October 1985.
   The State Department says nine Americans are among the foreign
hostages: Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, Thomas Sutherland, dean of agriculture at the
American University of Beirut, Frank Herbert Reed, director of the
Lebanon International School in Beirut; Joseph James Cicippio,
acting comptroller of the American University of Beirut; Edward
Austin Tracy, author; Jesse Jonathan Turner, visiting professor at
Beirut University College; Robert Polhill, assistant professor at
Beirum University College; Alann Steen, professor at Beirut
University College; Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, head of a
75-man observer group attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon.

   The State Department called Monday for the
immediate release of Czech human rights activists who were arrested
last week while engaging in what a spokesman described as a peaceful
demonstration.
   According to reports, hundreds of activists were detained while
attempting to visit the grave of Jan Palach, who burned himself to
death 20 years ago to protest the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   The Czechoslovak government's use of force to disrupt these
peaceful gatherings represents a ``direct violation'' of the
commitments undertaken by the Czechoslovak government at the recent
35-nation human rights conference in Vienna, State Department
spokesman Charles Redman said.
   ``We regret the Czechoslovak government's continued violation of
its international obligations on human rights,'' he said. ``We urge,
moreover, the immediate release of all those detained or arrested.''

   The eastern weather satellite providing the
popular cloud pictures seen in newspapers and on television is being
shifted westward after a satellite serving the western states died
from old age.
   The loss of GOES-West on Saturday leaves the nation with just one
stationary weather satellite. Another one is not due to be launched
for at least 18 months.
   ``We are going to miss GOES-West,'' said Thomas M. Pyke Jr., head
of satellite services at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. ``The full, two-GOES system is a vital part of our
network for tracking hurricanes and other severe storms.''
   Now, he said, meteoroligists will have ``only limited coverage of
Atlantic and Pacific ocean areas where these severe storms
originate.''
   In addition, Hawaii and Alaska will have only partial coverage.
   The failure of the satellite's imaging system was not a surprise.
The instrument had exceeded its expected lifespan last May and
engineers had been nursing it along.
   Within two hours of Saturday's failure, information was being
received from polar-orbiting satellites, Pyke said. Data will also
be available from the European and Japanese weather satellites.
   While having two stationary GOES (Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite) craft in orbit gives a broader view of the
nation's weather, operating with one has been done before.
   For nearly three years, beginning in 1984, the western satellite
was shifted eastward after the old eastern satellite failed.
   That problem was solved in March 1987, with the launch of the new
GOES-East satellite.
   That satellite is being moved slowly from a position 22,300 miles
over the Equator at 79.5 degrees west longitude to a position at 108
degrees west longtude. It should be at the new position by Feb. 21.
   That move is approximately equivalent to changing from looking at
the nation from a position south of Florence, S.C., to a new
location south of Durango, Colo.
   Moving GOES-East westward will allow it to see all of the
contiguous 48 states as well as westward to Hawaii and east to the
middle ot the Atlantic. Lost will be images of the western Pacific,
where storms could form to advance on Hawaii, and the eastern
Atlantic, the summertime breeding ground for hurricanes.
   In the spring, GOES-East will be moved somewhat to the east to
extend its coverage into hurricane breeding areas of the Atlantic
Ocean.
   It is the regular images provided by the stationary GOES
satellites that are most useful for following cloud movement,
tracking storms and watching for hurricanes.
   Two polar-orbiting NOAA satellites remain in use, but they
photograph each area of the Earth only twice daily in contrast to
the continual monitoring available from the GOES instruments.
   The failures of two GOES satellites have been blamed on light
bulbs used to illuminate the mirrors that detect cloud cover. The
current GOES-East has two light-emitting diodes in addition to two
light bulbs.
   The failed GOES-West was launched in 1983 and was expected to
last, at best, until May 1988. A successor planned for launch in
1986 was destroyed at lift-off when its booster rocket failed.
   Although the instruments that provide the cloud photos have
failed, GOES-West is still performing other functions. It collects
data readings radioed from buoys and land-based weather instruments
and relays the information to the National Weather Service.
   In addition, it serves as a communications relay station and will
relay data from GOES-East, from the polar-orbiting NOAA satellites
and from the European and Japanese satellites.
   GOES-West cost $16 million when it was built in 1983. The
replacement is planned for 1990 launch is part of a five-satellite
package. That series was originally budgeted at $410 million but it
now appears that the costs will be substantially higher.

<HEAD>Pressure Mounts For Independent Inquiry in Trading Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pressure is increasing on the Socialist government
for an independent investigation of a blossoming insider-trading
scandal that involves one of President Francois Mitterrand's closest
friends.
   Communist Party leader Andre Lajoinie and a prominent
conservative, Michel Noir, appealed Sunday for a parliamentary
investigation of suspicious trading in shares of the U.S. firm
Triangle Industries Inc. last fall, just before it was acquired by
Pechiney SA, a government-owned aluminum manufacturer.
   Officials at the presidential Elysee Palace say they will leave
the inquiry to the Commission des Operations de Bourse, watchdog
agency of the French stock exchange.
   ``Can the Elysee, which has preferred so far to defer to the
(stock exchange) investigation and the slow process of the justice
system, still shelter behind this line of defense?'' the financial
daily Les Echos asked in an editorial Monday.
   Alain Boublil, top aide to Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy,
resigned Friday, then filed libel suits against three publications
for reporting suspicions that he leaked vital information about the
Triangle takeover.
   A key figure is Roger-Patrice Pelat, a 70-year-old retired
businessman who met Mitterrand in a German prisoner-of-war camp.
They worked together in the French Resistance and Pelat has been a
frequent companion on the president's afternoon strolls through
Paris.
   Pelat was among investors who made quick profits by buying
Triangle stock at about $10 a share and selling a few days later
when Pechiney made its takeover bid Nov. 21 of $56 a share.
   On Saturday, the daily Le Monde said Mitterrand was given a
secret report saying Pelat or his son may have bought 40,000 shares
through a Swiss bank and a broker in Luxembourg in addition to the
10,000 he was known to have purchased through a French bank.
   Mitterrand's office issued a terse statement Monday night saying
he had not received a report on the subject. It offered no
explanation or elaboration beyond repeating that the inquiry was
exclusively in the hands of the stock market commission and anyone
found guilty should be punished.
   Palat said he would wait for the investigators' report before
commenting. ``I'm a patient man and I don't want to interfere with
the Commission des Operations de Bourse,'' he told reporters Monday
night outside his Paris apartment.
   French newspaper reports say the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission told its French counterpart it was investigating
purchases just before the takeover bid of about 220,000 shares in
Triangle, which usually changed hands at the rate of only a few
thousand a day.
   Much of the stock was bought through Swiss banks, which refuse to
identify their clients.
   Max Theret, a businessman with close ties to Mitterrand's
Socialists, has acknowledged buying 32,300 shares but claims he had
no inside information. Theret told reporters he tipped Pelat that
Triangle was a good buy.
   Many government officials besides Boublil were privy to the
Pechiney-Triangle deal, which needed Finance Ministry approval. How
the information was leaked to some buyers, if in fact it was, has
not become clear.
   The stock exchange investigating agency, which says it expects to
finish its probe by the end of January, issued a statement denying
it was the source of the report Le Monde mentioned.
   If it finds enough evidence, the commission can give the file to
prosecutors for pursuit. It has no power to do more.
   Successful prosecutions have been rare in French stock market
cases and even rarer in political scandals, which often fade away
unresolved after capturing the headlines for weeks.
   Liberation, a leftist newspaper generally sympathetic to the
Socialist government, said Monday the involvement of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission made it less likely the
Pechiney-Triangle matter would be covered up.
   ``An inquiry leading to the punishment of guilt and complicity
according to the law remains the only salvation for the shaken
authorities,'' Liberation said. ``This would be unprecedented in the
history of French scandals.''

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors told Teamsters union leaders to
fire five top executives and promise internal reforms as part of a
formula aimed at settling a massive racketeering lawsuit, the Los
Angeles Times reported Monday.
   ``The negotiations are being handled by the U.S. attorney's
office in New York,'' an unidentified federal source told the Times.
   In New York, the lead prosecutor in the case, Randy Mastro,
declined to confirm or deny the report. He said the government was
still preparing to go to trial Feb. 27.
   Resignations were demanded from executive board members Harold
Friedman of Cleveland, Joseph Trerotola of New York, Robert Holmes
of Detroit, Joseph A. Morgan of Hallandale, Fla., and Ted R. Cozza
of Pittsburgh, the newspaper reported.
   Ten other international vice presidents who helped form the
union's governing board would be permitted to remain in office if
they signed a public statement calling for internal reforms within
the union, including the establishment of secret-ballot elections,
the Times said.
   The lawsuit filed in June seeks the removal of top leaders of the
1.6 million-member union on grounds that they are under the
influence of organized crime.

   The number of deaths from AIDS in New York City
rose 17 percent last year to 3,710, the health commissioner reported
Monday. It was the leading cause of death among men ages 30 to 44
and women 25 to 39.
   However, the rate of increase slowed, said Stephen Joseph, the
commissioner. The rise in 1987 was 40 percent, he said.
   AIDS was the third leading cause of death in the city, accounting
for 5 percent of all deaths. The leading cause was heart disease,
which accounted for 38 percent, followed by cancer, for 20 percent.
   Homicide was rated sixth, causing 3 percent of the deaths.
   Joseph said nearly 19,000 people have been diagnosed with AIDS in
New York City, 23 percent of the national total. About 10,000 have
died.

   The State Department said Monday the Polish
government's offer to negotiate the renewee legalization of the
Solidarity trade union is ``an encouraging and potentially historic
step forward.''
   Department spokesman Charles Redman welcomed both the
government's offer and what he described as the ``constructive''
reaction to it by the Solidarity leadership.
   ``The process of national reconciliation that may be beginning
holds great promise,'' he said, adding that the issues are complex
and that arduous negotiations may be required.
   ``The relegalization of an independent Solidarity and the
implementation of other significant social, political and economic
reforms would lay the basis for the national recovery the Polish
people seek and deserve,'' Redman said.
   ``The Polish government and Solidarity will have our full support
as they pursue genuine good faith negotiations.''
   Polish authorities ended Solidarity's 16-month legal existence
with a military crackdown in December 1981.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Darman To Head Budget Office</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee sent Richard Darman's
nomination as President Bush's budget chief to the full Senate on
Monday, clearing the way for what is expected to be quick
confirmation.
   On a 9-0 vote, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
recommended that the full chamber consent to Darman's nomination to
head the Office of Management and Budget.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the panel's chairman, said the Senate
would vote on the appointment Wednesday.
   ``I know of nothing that would stand in the way of that,'' he
said.
   Darman provided no new details of what Bush will propose next
month when he announces how he will revise the $1.15 trillion fiscal
1990 budget that President Reagan sent Congress on Jan. 9. Under
law, the spending plan must have a deficit of no more than $100
billion, which means at least $27 billion in savings must be found.
   ``Obviously, we're looking at all parts of the budget, with the
exception of Social Security,'' Darman told the lawmakers.
   Darman, who was questioned for a total of more than nine hours
Monday and last Thursday, reiterated that new taxes would also not
be part of the package.
   ``We are firm, and have to be, on the no-new-taxes point,'' he
said. ``The then-vice president campaigned on that issue
unequivocally and won 426 electoral votes. I think it ought not to
be taken lightly.''
   Darman, who on Thursday had listed several examples of taxes that
would be included under that pledge, on Monday added two new ones to
the list: higher levies on alcohol and tobacco.
   Darman and other Bush administration officials plan to meet
Tuesday with congressional leaders to discuss the budget for the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   After Monday's hearing, Darman said the Tuesday session was aimed
at discussing ``the best approach to get the process moving more
quickly than it would normally move.''
   Bush plans to discuss the budget in a speech to a joint session
of Congress on Feb. 9, and to provide details of his own spending
plan a few days later.
   Darman, a 45-year-old native of Charlotte, N.C., is a former
managing director of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the investment
banking firm, and served under Reagan as deputy treasury secretary
and as a top White House aide.
   He worked in the departments of defense, justice, and health,
education and welfare during the Nixon administration, and the
Commerce Department under President Ford.
   He has also taught at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School
of Government and the Harvard Business School.

<HEAD>Charter 77 Appeals For Dialogue, Some Activists Released</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A human rights group appealed
Monday to the government to respond to the worst unrest in 20 years
by talking to the people and firing those who ordered ``brutal''
police action against demonstrators.
   Czechoslovak Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek made a similar appeal in
a letter warning the government of possible confrontation and
denouncing police violence, according to an emigre in Vienna.
   The demands by the human rights group Charter 77 came in a
document it says it is sending to the national government and
parliament.
   Activist Petr Uhl presented the paper at a news conference and
urged East and West bloc governments, groups and individuals to
protest the detentions of dissidents such as Vaclav Havel, who he
said is ``the only writer of significance in jail anywhere in
Europe.''
   Havel and 15 other activists were detained Jan. 16 on Prague's
central Wenceslas Square after eight of them tried to lay flowers in
memory of Jan Palach, a student who burned himself alive 20 years
ago to protest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Prague.
   Five of them have been released, but face hooliganism charges
carrying up to two years' jail, Uhl said.
   Havel likely will face the same charge, he said. The playwright
spent four years in jail after a 1979 subversion trial that provoked
outcry in the West.
   The unrest began Jan. 15, when police used batons, dogs, tear gas
and water cannon to break up 5,000 people defying a ban on a Palach
rally.
   Crowds demanding more freedom gathered daily on Wenceslas Square.
   Wednesday's rally was allowed to proceed peacefully, but riot
police Thursday beat several demonstrators to disperse the crowd.
   By Saturday, the situation was outwardly calm, stilled by police
patrols, threats of prosecution and hundreds of arrests.
   But, Uhl said, that same day 400 to 500 people were detained
temporarily at Vsetaty village, 18 miles north of Prague, as they
tried to attend a graveside vigil for Palach.
   In Budapest, Hungarian police Saturday prevented 50 members of an
independent group called the Federation of Young Democrats from
laying a wreath outside the Czechoslovak Embassy to commemorate Jan
Palach, Magyar Nemzet daily reported Monday. It said the police
cited ``existing international rulings.''
   Tomasek's letter, provided by an emigre in Vienna, said, ``The
trust of the faithful, as well as of a majority of the population,
was badly shaken by the police action against peaceful
demonstrations ...
   ``I fear that by suppressing dialogue between the citizens and
the government, a confrontation is being provoked to the detriment
of all of us,'' the prelate said in the letter, which was dated Jan.
20 and addressed to Czechoslovak Premier Ladislav Adamec.
   Charter 77's document urged the Communist Party t appoint leaders
``who are capable of opening a dialogue with the whole of society.''
   ``Without dialogue, the democratic solution of the most immediate
and weighty social and economic problems is not possible,'' the
document said.
   It also demanded that ``all officials responsible for the
unjustified and brutal police action be recalled from their
functions,'' including Interior Minister Frantisek Kincl.
   Official media have accused Charter 77 and other independent
groups of provoking anti-socialist actions.
   Newspapers and television have quoted or shown several citizens
speaking out against the demonstrations and calling for order so
economic reforms proposed by authorities can take effect.
   On Monday, however, Rude Pravo quoted nine people who went to
Vsetaty and struck a more moderate tone.
   It quoted a 25-year-old identified only as Rudolf M. as saying,
``In our country, there is censorship. That's why I'm here, to see
what is happening.''
   His quote was accompanied by an editor's note saying censorship
was abolished in 1968.

   A clandestine radio broadcast by
Nicaraguan rebels on Monday accused Honduran guerrillas of helping
assassinate a Contra military commander earlier this month.
   Manuel Adan Rugama Acevedo, a regional commander of
anti-government Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras, was shot and
killed Jan. 7 as he drove a jeep in Tegucigalpa. Contras mount
attacks on Nicaragua from Honduras.
   Monday's rebel broadcast, made by a ``Commander Jackson,''
repeated accusations that Nicaraguan government commandos killed
Rugama, also known as ``Commander Aureliano.''
   But it also said Honduras' Popular Liberation Forces, a communist
guerrilla group, took part in the attack.
   The Popular Liberation Forces have not claimed responsibility for
Rugama's shooting. The leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua
claims it stemmed from Contra infighting.
   The Popular Liberation Forces emerged in 1979 as the first armed
group of the Honduran Communist Party, which has operated
underground since it was founded in 1950. Authorities blame the
group for more than 10 attacks against U.S. companies in Honduras,
the hijackings of three commercial airliners, and the kidnappings of
businessmen.
   In July 1988, the group claimed responsibility for an attack at a
discotheque in San Pedro Sula that injured six U.S. soldiers.
   Rugama was buried Jan. 13 in San Francisco, where his mother,
Elsa Acevedo, lives.

<TEXT>
   When it comes to the collateral relatives of the
14th Earl of Meath or the coat of arms of the 17th Duke of Norfolk,
Debrett's of London has no peer.
   But the experts on British nobility apparently are not as
familiar with U.S. presidents.
   In the English publisher's new venture into Americana,
``Debrett's Presidents of the United States of America,'' a
full-page color reproduction of Rembrandt Peale's famous 1805
portrait of Thomas Jefferson is labeled as a portrait of his
predecessor, John Adams.
   No one would suggest that all Americans look alike to the
British, but the book's facing page does show a painting in which
Adams, Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin are shown drafting the
Declaration of Independence.
   Although Jefferson is three decades younger than in the Peale
portrait, his jutting chin and flowing hair make him hard to confuse
with Adams, notable for his receding hairline and long sideburns.
   The book's American publisher is Salem House of Topsfield, Mass.
Roberta Scimone, a spokeswoman, said the mistake was made by the
British publisher, Webb and Bower. She said it would be corrected in
any future editions.

<HEAD>Cardin Splits on Hemline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pierre Cardin solved the problem of hemlines,
showing splits that soar beyond the thigh Monday in a spring-summer
haute couture collection that is leggy, relaxed and refined.
   The mood remained strictly feminine in six showings dominated by
tender, whispy fabrics, bias cuts, body-hugging sheaths, oversized
pants and plenty of pleats.
   Balmain excelled in suits, and Nina Ricci turned out beautiful
dresses for a quiet summer night.
   Christian Dior went to the sari to achieve the draped look, using
pyramid-shaped jackets for contrast in his less exotic fare.
   But it was Cardin who proved the most daring with his
``long-short'' style. Refusing to say no to the ``mini,'' he made it
even tinier then covered it up _ almost.
   Suit skirts and dresses were slit front and back to the top of
the thigh revealing a mini or little shorts. In a more elegant
version, minis were covered with long flowing wraps fastened at the
bodice or printed accordian-pleated skirts.
   In another variation, he covered some tight sheaths with
cloak-like jackets, showing one particularly sultry version in a
black slipper satin.
   Cardin also refused to abandon the structured shoulder, replacing
pads in suit jackets with little front tucks, sometimes bowed, that
provide presence for the upper torso without overwhelming. But like
others, he did not ignore the bare shoulder, showing strapless
sheaths and jumpsuits.
   Bows were everywhere at Cardin, at the waist, down sleeves and on
shoulders, and cropped up periodically in other collections. One
evening gown at Balmain featured an oversized bow fastened on the
diagonal across the front.
   Cardin also emphasized asymetrical cuts, using them effectively
on suit jackets, sometimes ending in a fringe.
   Ecological colors _ muted pastels _ prevailed at Cardin. But navy
was big with all the houses.
   Navy was a predominant color at Dior, who also featured lots of
beige _ dressed up with bright turquoises and fuchsias. Colors
sometimes went wild, with hot pink and orange used in a dress and
jacket.
   An array of beige and pastel suits were accented with brightly
colored little pocket books and belts. Other suits featured flower
embroidery on the jacket back or front.
   Dior kept the hemline demurely above the knee for daytime.
   But suits were also temptresses at Dior, shown with black lace
bustiers, translucent blouses, or nothing at all.
   A navy suit with touches of strass embroidery over a nearly
transparent navy mousseline blouse was a lovely example of city chic.
   Dior waxed exotic with his sari wrap, draping feathery fabrics
like crepe georgette or shantung silk crepe in a diagonal movement
from the waist to the opposite shoulder, and Indian style, around
the back to the hand.
   The effect is both feminine and whimsical, but Western women will
likely have to learn to how to handle a handful of scarf _ and use
it to best effect.
   Danish designer Erik Mortensen produced a lively collection
splashed with color for Pierre Balmain. His tri-color suits with
oversized buttons on short jackets were pure sophistication, along
with a white suit with oversized black buttons. Little dresses in
bursts of color were fun.
   He also showed some deep slits, but was less daring than Cardin.
   Mortensen moved easily into evening elegance without abandoning
color. Wide silk crepe pants and tunic or dresses in silk crepe or
satin gauze ran the color spectrum. Two black, strapless lacey
evening gowns were adorned with huge stand-out flowers, in yellow at
the bodice or red flowers down the train.
   Nina Ricci, not known as a trend-setter, produced a large
collection of simple but beautiful clothes for all times of day.
   Using lots of wide, soft pants, pleats, swirling skirts and
cinched waists, designer Gerard Pipart achieved a classic, somewhat
nostalgic femininity.
   Filmy dresses in soft colors seemed to float down the runway.
Suits, sometimes with deep decolletes, and pant suits cut on a bias
guaranteed the feminine touch.
   Dress hems were mostly below the knee, and pant legs ended above
the ankle.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer seemed to luxuriate in pants, and pleats,
showing every kind of pants suit for day and evening, often dressed
up with lace or embroidery. He produced stunning geometrical pleats
in an ivory day dress, the pleats running verticle at the bodice,
horizontal at the haunch and vertical again in the skirt.
   Pleats also were used effectively in a body-hugging ivory sheath
brocaded at the haunch.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party
lost a key state election to a regional party allied with his chief
national rival, according to final results announced Monday.
   Gandhi's party led, however, in two smaller states where partial
returns had been tallied, news reports said.
   The voting in Tamil Nadu, a southern state, was viewed as a key
test of the popularity of Gandhi, who must call national
parliamentary elections by December. Gandhi was elected to a
five-year term in December 1984.
   In Tamil Nadu, the Dravida Progressive Front and its allies won
170 seats in the 234-member state Assembly, said chief electoral
officer D.K. Oza, who announced results of Saturday's balloting.
   Led by former state Chief Minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi, the
party is allied with a new national coalition called the National
Front headed by Gandhi's chief rival, V.P. Singh.
   Former movie actress Jayalalitha Jayaram's faction won seats in
33 constituencies. Gandhi's party came in third with just 26 seats,
Oza said.
   His party had hoped to retake control in Tamil Nadu after the
death of Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran, a popular actor who
turned to politics. After his death, his huge party splintered into
two groups, one led by his former leading lady Ms. Jayaram and the
other by his widow, Janaki Ramachandran.
   Her faction gained only one Assembly seat, independents won two,
and voting was postponed in two districts after the death of
candidates.
   ``It's a verdict against Rajiv Gandhi,'' Karunanidhi told
hundreds of cheering supporters outside his home in central Madras.
``I hope this victory is repeated in the national elections.''
   An editorial in Monday's editions of the Madras-based Hindu
newspaper said, ``The voters have dealt a severe blow to the image
and prospects of the party in power, which went out of the way to
make this appear a contest of vital political significance.''
   Political commentator Cho Ramaswamy said the defeat in Tamil Nadu
could hurt Gandhi in national elections because Singh will project
the regional party's victory as his own. ``Many members of the
Congress Party will be jittery,'' he said.
   However, G.K. Moopanar, president of the Congress Party in Tamil
Nadu, disputed that Congress was badly hurt and said national
elections ``are still far off.''
   Gandhi had campaigned for his party's candidates throughout Tamil
Nadu, and there was speculation he might call early national
elections if successful there.
   Vote tallying began Monday for ballots cast Saturday in Assembly
elections in the northeastern states of Nagaland and Mizoram, where
ballot boxes from remote interior villages had to be collected by
helicopter.
   Partial returns showed Gandhi's party leading in both states,
which have a history of insurgency and unrest, news reports said.
The voting in all three states, which were placed under federal rule
after political crises last year, will restore local control.
   Gandhi's party was slightly ahead in Nagaland with 23 seats in
the 60-member Assembly. Its only challenger, the Nagaland People's
Council, gained 18, according to news reports on government-owned
television Doordarshan.
   In Mizoram, Gandhi's party led in a three-way race for the
40-seat Assembly. Congress captured 14 seats, compared with eight
for the Mizo National Front and 1 for the People's Conference,
United News of India news agency said.

<HEAD>Surprise! Making Your Own Salad Is Cheaper</HEAD>

   The Agriculture Department, reaffirming what
many shoppers figured out long ago, said Monday that making a salad
from a supermarket salad bar is more expensive than buying the
ingredients whole and making the salad from scratch.
   Nutritionist Eileen P. Newman said a survey of 55 items showed,
for example, that ``many common salad ingredients, including
cucumbers, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, spinach and green peppers,
cost from two to four times more at salad bars.''
   The department's advise, based on its survey of Washington-area
supermarkets last July: Consumers ``may want to weigh the cost of
salad bar purchases against preparing the items at home.''

   Her own two brothers and her sister are
pro-choice, Elizabeth Bender, 50, of Pittsburgh, said with a sad
shake of her white hair, but her entire brood _ all nine kids, four
girls and five boys, ages 23 to 11 _ are firmly against abortion.
   Theirs is a medical household _ she's a former nurse and husband
Thomas is a pediatric radiologist _ and the kids grew up paging
through medical textbooks. They studied the pictures, and they
believe they know the difference between tissue and person, death
and life.
   ``Nobody in his right mind would say this isn't a human being, a
person,'' said Mrs. Bender.
   Among the thousands who assembled Monday to march on the 16th
anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade abortion decision,
there were a multitude of reasons for being here but a singular
intensity.
   Construction worker Tom Noel, 28, marched. In his spare hours, he
counsels pregnant women _ some little more than children, some older
than he is _ in a pregnancy aid center. He doesn't believe in
showing them awful pictures of bloody fetuses.
   He said he never knows if he has been persuasive and prevented an
abortion. ``Very few come back to tell you,'' he said. ``But I know
I've changed some minds. I know I've saved a few.''
   Noel's siblings, five brothers, two sisters, agree on the
abortion issue except ``my liberal brother, in California.''
   Said Noel: ``He's in favor, when the mother's life is in danger.
I think that's a cop-out.''
   Jacinta Trimmer, 27, of Wheaton, Md., marched. She's in the Army,
an ultra-sound technologist whose machine scans pregnant mothers at
Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
   ``I see little babies every day,'' she said. ``I see them
develop. I see the eyes. I see the hands and the fingers. I see them
opening their mouths.
   ``A lot of these mothers who have abortions, their basic instinct
of love comes back, and they feel bad about it.''
   A few minutes later, a soft additional fact: ``My sister had two
abortions. She's hurtful now, and sorrowful. Now she's an activist,
too.''
   Bill Smith, 59, of Rochester, N.Y. marched. A huge sign, so heavy
he had to carry it in a sling, put his case in capitalistic terms:
``4,000 Home Grown American Customers Murdered Each Day by
Abortion.''
   He told of a time that argument made an impact on a co-worker.
   Smith said he works for Eastman Kodak in a two-million square
foot warehouse. Once, the conversation got around to abortion and a
young forklift operator offered some views about a woman's right to
have control over her own body.
   At the time, Kodak workers were afraid of layoffs, so Smith put
the issue this way: If 4,000 births a day are prevented from
occurring, he said, there would be that many fewer baby snapshots
taken, that much less Kodak film used, that many more Kodak layoffs.
   Tom and Abigail O'Donnell of Lakewood, Ohio, marched. He's a
retired mechanic with the National Guard. They came here for George
Bush's inauguration and stayed on for the march.
   She doesn't buy the argument that people who cannot afford to
raise children are entitled to have abortions.
   ``We could never afford any of ours,'' she said. ``We have five.''
   Do the O'Donnells have any friends who do not oppose abortion?
   They think a while, decide they probably do.
   ``We don't discuss it,'' said Mrs. O'Donnell. ``I'm just
embarrassed for them.''
   Said her husband: ``It's a pluralistic society. We don't condemn
them. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying those people are thinking
poorly.''
   Said his wife: ``I wouldn't ask them point blank. I wouldn't want
to know.''

   A predawn earthquake in Soviet Central Asia
unleashed a 50-foot-high wall of dirt and mud that buried a mountain
village and swept through at least two others Monday, killing up to
1,000 people as they slept, officials said.
   The devastating earthquake in the republic of Tadzhikistan was
the second to strike the Soviet Union in two months.
   ``Almost everybody died,'' Zainiddin Nasreddinov, editor-in-chief
of Tadzhikistan's official news agency, said by telephone after
visiting the wrecked farming settlement of Sharora. He estimated the
number of dead there alone at 600.
   Sharora ``had more than 150 peasant households before that tragic
moment,'' the Soviet news agency Tass reported. ``Now most of it is
razed to the ground by the ruthless force of the natural calamity.''
   Tass said the number of dead in the disaster zone 1,800 miles
southeast of Moscow was estimated at 1,000, but cautioned that was a
preliminary figure.
   ``Rescue work is being continued and distant mountain villages
have not been checked yet,'' Tass said. Damaged roads were hampering
those efforts.
   The quake struck the southwestern part of Tadzhikistan, a Soviet
republic of more than 4.8 million people that borders Afghanistan
and China.
   The 40-second tremor, at 5:02 a.m. (6:02 p.m. EST Sunday) was
centered about 20 to 30 miles southwest of Tadzhikistan's capital of
Dushanbe, a city of more than 460,000 people, in the fertile Gissar
district, a center of grapegrowing and livestock-raising, Tass said.
   An official at Dushanbe's seismic center said the quake was
strong enough to knock things off shelves in tall apartment
buildings in the city, but that it caused no known damage or
injuries there. He declined to give his name.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Va., estimated the quake at
5.4 on the Richter scale, which measures ground motion as recorded
on a seismograph. The Dec. 7 earthquake in northwestern Armenia,
1,300 miles west of Dushanbe, registered a 6.9 on the Richter scale
and killed 25,000 people.
   The earthquake unhinged a wall of sodden dirt and mud at least
five miles wide that buried the village of Okuli-Bolo and much of
Sharora, said Erkin Kasimov, an official of Tadzhikistan's Foreign
Ministry.
   ``Almost all of the victims died asleep in their beds,'' Police
Maj. Alexander Loparev, duty officer at Tadzhikistan Interior
Ministry headquarters in Dushanbe said by telephone.
   Residents of another village, Okuli-Poyen, apparently roused in
time, fled in panic before the mudslide, which traveled 1\ to 1{
miles, could reach their homes, Kasimov said from Dushanbe.
   Officials and Soviet media said the devastation was vast, and
total in places.
   In Okuli-Bolo and Okuli-Poyen, near the epicenter, ``everything
is destroyed _ all the homes, the schools, the hospitals and
clinics, the stores,'' Nasreddinov said.
   Okuli-Bolo is a ``heap of rubble'' and the chairman of a local
economic cooperative, Hairrulo Yuldashev, said the households of 70
peasant families were ``completely demolished and buried by the
landslide,'' Tass said. More than 70 villagers were buried by the
landslide, it said.
   In Sharora, ``cries and wails can be heard everwhere,'' Tass
reported. ``Some are bemoaning and burying their near and dear ones,
while others are trying to find the few survivors between the thick
layer of sand and clay.''
   It said all of the village's streets had been buried under the
50-foot-high layer of earth that the earthquake detached from a hill
near the village.
   The TV news program ``Vremya'' showed aerial footage of Sharora,
with white roofs of buried homes peeking through the dirt like
seashells scattered on a beach.
   Kasimov said that according to preliminary figures, the quake and
landslide destroyed about 100 buildings, including five schools and
a maternity hospital near the epicenter.
   The hospital was evacuated of mothers and newborns before the
wall of mud arrived and there were no victims, he said.
   There was no exact count available for the population of the
stricken villages. But the official at the Dushanbe seismic center
said families are traditionally large in the mostly Moslem republic,
and that one dwelling often houses eight to 10 people.
   The quake and landslide downed three miles of power lines,
destroyed nine miles of telephone lines and inundated four miles of
a navigation canal with mud, Kasimov said.
   ``Thousands of head of publicly owned cattle have perished,''
Tass said. It said thousands of acres of fertile farmland were
covered ``by a thick layer of sand and clay.''
   Nasreddinov said the buildings destroyed were one-story brick
structures. Soldiers went to the villages to keep order and restore
communications, electricity and water, he said.
   Kasimov said geologists believed water from mountain springs had
accumulated under the soil of the hills in the Gissar region, making
them prone to mudslides.
   ``When the earthquake came, it was like a catapult, and it hurled
the sodden earth onto the villages below,'' Kasimov said.
   Tass said bulldozers, cranes and excavators had been rushed to
the quake zone to help dig for survivors, and that volunteers had
come from Dushanbe and other nearby areas to help in rescue and
relief.
   Equipment, food and fuel were also sent to the scene, Tass said.
   On ``Vremya,'' a statement of condolences from the Kremlin
leadership was read, and aid promised from the national government.
According to Nasreddinov, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev telephoned
Tadzhikistan officials to promise Moscow's help.
   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman
said he knew of no request for assistance from the Soviets. ``Our
sympathy certainly goes out again to the victims of this most recent
earthquake,'' he said.
   The experience of the Armenian earthquake shows the death toll in
Tadzhikistan could be much higher than the first estimates. Soviet
officials, including Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnaze,
initially spoke of ``thousands'' of victims in the Armenian quake.
Kremlin spokesmen later estimated 55,000 people had been killed, but
on Dec. 29, Armenian officials gave what they called an accurate
death toll of 25,000.

<HEAD>Eisenhower Statue Unveiled by Thatcher, U.S. Ambassador</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Monday unveiled
a statue of Dwight D. Eisenhower facing the building he used as his
headquarters while commanding Allied forces in World War II.
   Mrs. Thatcher declared Eisenhower ``a true leader of his country
and of the free world,'' and said his presidency would be
``remembered as a golden age of peace and prosperity.''
   She joined U.S. Ambassador Charles H. Price II in unveiling the
life-size statue outside the U.S. Embassy, which shows Eisenhower
with hands on hips, wearing a military uniform.
   One inscription quotes from his order of the day to troops who
launched the June 6, 1944, Allied invasion of German-occupied
Europe: ``Soldiers, sailors and airmen of the Allied Expeditionary
Force: you are about to embark upon a great crusade ... The hopes
and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.''
   The other, from his inaugural address as president on Jan. 20,
1953, reads: ``The faith we hold belongs not to us alone but to the
free of all the world.''
   The statue, sculpted by American Robert Dean, was contributed by
Kansas dignitaries including Donald J. Hall, chairman of Hallmark
Cards Inc., and chairman of the Hall Family Foundation.
   Among 120 guests at the unveiling were Eisenhower's son, John,
the U.S. Ambassador-designate to West Germany, Gen. Vernon Walters,
and Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie.
   ``That we in Europe are secure in our freedom now owes much to
men like Gen. Eisenhower who had the vision and inner strength to
stand up to Stalin's wish to advance the Iron Curtain westward,''
said Mrs. Thatcher.
   Eisenhower governed for two terms until 1961, when he retired to
his farm near Gettysburg, Pa. He died there March 28, 1969.

   Florida's Salvador Dali Museum, which
houses the world's largest collection of Dali works, will hold a
memorial service the same day a funeral is held for the famous
surrealist painter.
   Dali, 84, died Monday. His funeral was planned for Wednesday in
Figueras, Spain, where he was born and lived for many years.
   Museum founder A. Reynolds Morse flew to Spain Monday to pay
personal respects to the artist he knew for half a lifetime.
   Morse called Dali ``the greatest artist of the 20th century.'' He
also called himself one of Dali's few friends.
   ``Although he has always been surrounded by crowds, only a few
people in a small circle have truly known him. Our lives have been
enriched by being in that circle,'' said Morse, who is in his
mid-70s.
   The museum, which opened March 7, 1982, was founded on a
collection built by Morse. It's collection includes 93 oils, 55 of
them on display; nearly 150 drawings; 2,000 graphics and
lithographs; and an extensive archive and library.
   ``It is very difficult for us to make a formal statement. What
can we say?'' Morse said in a statement issued by the museum. ``He
is the greatest artist of the 20th century. And he was our friend.''
   He called Dali ``a major influence in our lives giving us the
best education in art we could possibly have and, most importantly,
giving us himself.''
   The memorial service will be led by museum curator Joan Kropf and
J. Scott Simmons, executive director of the museum which had nearly
116,000 visitors in 1988, a 12 percent increase over the previous
year.
   Admission to the museum will be free all day Tuesday and
Wednesday morning. It will be closed Wednesday afternoon.
   ``We at the Salvador Dali Museum mourn the passing of a genius
whose works inspire millions around the world,'' museum officials
said in a statement. ``We also mourn the passing of a man whose mind
never stopped investigating the world around him, and whose
curiosity led him to explore the depths of the subconscious and the
heights of artistic expressions.''

<HEAD>Government Official Says Only Compromise Can Save Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deputy prime minister explained the
Communist Party's about-face on legalizing Solidarity by saying only
compromise can rouse the people and economy from apathy.
   ``Economic reform needs political backing not only from the
government but also from the constructive opposition: it needs
social support,'' Ireneusz Sekula said in an interview Monday with
the official news agency PAP.
   His comments come the day after Solidarity accepted a Communist
Party offer to negeotiate legalizing the banned trade union
federation.
   ``There is no choice. Either we decide on actions forming a
feasible chance of success or we reject them, selecting defeat right
from the start,'' PAP quoted Sekula as saying.
   He said the government needs support from the opposition and
people at large to help pull ``the economy and people out from
apathy, helplessness and stillness.''
   Solidarity's National Executive Commission on Sunday agreed to
negotiate and said talks to reverse Poland's economic and social
troubles should begin as soon as possible.
   ``One of the most difficult things will be the matter of economic
action, reforming the economy. ... This is an essential matter,''
said Mieczyslw Gil, one of three Solidarity leaders preparing the
union's negotiating position.
   Groups of Solidarity activists and factory commissions would hold
discussions on economic reform, Gil said.
   The official media, which once denounced or ignored Solidarity's
activities, has published straightforward accounts of its position
since the party offer was made Wednesday.
   Front pages of Monday's newspapers were filled with discussion of
the offer and Solidarity's agreement.
   Trybuna Ludu, the Communist Party newspaper, carried the full
text of the independent union's statement and its own report with
extensive quotes from Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   But voices of dissent can be heard complaining of the party's new
stance.
   ``Let's speak the truth: achievements are meager and there are a
lot of problems and worries,'' said Alfred Miodowicz, head of the
only official trade union alliance, in an interview with the
government newspaper Rzeczpospolita.
   In Washington, President Bush's chief spokesman said the White
House welcomes the announcement of negotiations.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. government long
has felt that progress toward reform ``can only take place through a
policy of dialogue and national reconciliation.''
   It also would have a positive effect on U.S.-Polish relations,
Fitzwater said. He noted that Bush visited Poland and several other
European countries in 1987 and watches developments there with
interest.
   Poland's government first proposed talks with the opposition last
August during serious labor turmoil started by workers angry about
the failure of wages to keep pace with inflation.
   Walesa said he would not enter discussions unless the party made
a political decision to legalize the union.
   Poland faces a mounting foreign debt and people are tired of
continual price increases and chronic shortages.
   In the PAP interview, Sekula said the complexity of the situation
means the government's economic strategy no longer can be directed
simply at fighting inflation.
   He suggested increasing production of consumer goods and curbing
consumption to achieve market balance.
   Polish Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski ended a visit to West
Germany Monday with an appeal to Bonn for ``concrete support and
understanding, above all in decreasing (Poland's) foreign debt'' of
$39 billion, ZDF Television reported.
   Friedhelm Ost, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief
spokesman, said preparations are being made for Kohl to visit Poland
later this year. He said the trip could be soon, but gave no date.

   The Vietnamese government Monday turned
over to the United States remains believed to be those of 23
Americans killed in the Vietnam War, a U.S. embassy spokesman said.
   Spokesman Ross Petzing said the remains were being flown to the
U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii aboard a U.S. Air
Force C141 aircraft.
   The center and the U.S. Army's Central Identification Laboratory
are charged with locating and identifying the remains of servicemen
listed as missing in the Vietnam War, which ended for American
troops in 1973.
   Currently, 2,383 Americans are listed as missing in action in
Indochina; 1,747 are listed in Vietnam, 547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia
and six in China.
   In the past year, Vietnam has cooperated more closely with
Washington to resolve MIA cases. The United States says the issue
and the presence of Vietnamese troops in Cambodia prevent
normalization of relations between the countries.
   The latest repatriation of remains comes a month after Vietnam
turned over the remains of 38 individuals, the largest group since
the war's end. Vietnam also has allowed U.S. search teams to roam
the country and interview witnesses and local government officials
in areas where MIAs had been reported.
   In response, the U.S. government has softened its hard-line
attitude toward Vietnam by expressing appreciation for the
cooperation.
   Hanoi has denied there are any Americans still being held
prisoners of war in Vietnam, a claim disputed by some private
American groups.

<HEAD>Uprising Leaders Reject Peace Plan, Firebomb Hits Israeli Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro-PLO underground leaders Monday rejected
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's offer of elections in the occupied
lands, and called for escalating the Palestinian uprising to counter
tougher army policies.
   In the city of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, assailants
hurled firebombs into an Israeli bank, injuring several Arab
employees and causing minor property damage, the army said. Arab
reports said four employees were treated for burns or smoke
inhalation.
   A 33-year-old man was shot with a plastic bullet in the West Bank
village of Jaba, and four Palestinians were wounded in the occupied
Gaza Strip when army troops opened fire to halt stone throwing, Arab
hospital officials said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   In an underground leaflet circulated in the occupied territories,
the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising rejected Rabin's
proposal to hold elections in return for an end to violence. Rabin,
No. 2 in the left-leaning Labor Party, also proposed extended
autonomy as an interim solution.
   The leaflet said the proposal ``will be sent to the garbage dump
of history.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc,
also criticized Rabin's plan.
   ``I hear that all the Arabs reject this plan,'' Shamir told
Israel radio. ``I would not propose that we enter into a whirlpool
of arguments about a thing that stands no change of coming into
being.''
   Shamir's closest ally, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, said
Israel's peace plan still was being formulated.
   Arens, speaking to leaders of Hadassah, an American Jewish
women's organization, rejected talks with the PLO and Israeli
participation in a proposed international peace conference.
   A dozen Israeli peace activists, meanwhwile, met with
Palestinians in the Arab village of Jabel Mukaber on the edge of
Jerusalem and told residents they backed Israeli talks with the PLO.
   The meeting was part of a mounting campaign to pressure Israel to
change its policy toward the PLO, which recently renounced terrorism
and recognized the Jewish state.
   ``Even my friends in the Likud are getting around to the idea''
of talking to the PLO, said peace activist Moshe Amirav, who was
kicked out of the Likud bloc for meeting with Palestinian leaders.
``They are realizing we have no choice but to talk.''
   Uprising leaders said in their leaflet that an Israeli agreement
to an international conference with PLO participation was required
for an end to anti-Israeli violence.
   The leaflet, the 33rd distributed since the uprising began 13
months ago, said Palestinians will step up their fight against the
occupation despite tougher army policies for dealing with the
rebellion.
   Addressed to ``Our Heroic People,'' it said: ``We know such
measures will never stop you from escalating the uprising. ... It
doesn't matter how long it takes and how many martyrs have to be
sacrificed.''
   Last week, the army announced that it will destroy the homes of
stone-throwers and fire plastic bullets at fleeing assailants and
protesters who build stone barricades.
   Plastic-tipped bullets were introduced in August as a less lethal
alternative to lead rounds. But at least 40 deaths have been
attributed to the plastic ammunition, according to Israeli
newspapers.
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, 367 Palestinians and
15 Israelis have been killed.
   In response to widespread criticism of the army policies,
Attorney General Yosef Harish has agreed to review the open-fire
orders with top legal advisers this week.
   Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said the policies will
help retore calm in the occupied lands.
   ``Maybe at the first stage it will lead to tension but if we see
it in longer perspective, I assume it will eventually bring a
relaxation,'' he said on Israel radio.

<TEXT>
   Surrealist painter Salvador Dali, whose
fantastic and memorable dreamscapes were as eccentric and flamboyant
as his behavior, died today in his hometown, his doctor said. He was
84.
   Dali died at 10:15 a.m. at Figueras Hospital, said Dr. Charles
Ponsati. ``The cause of death was cardiac arrest brought on by his
respiratory insufficiency and pneumonia,'' he told reporters.
   The painter had been in poor health and confined to a wheelchair
since suffering severe burns in an electrical fire in his home in
August 1984.
   He was rushed to the hospital five days ago. Suffering from a bad
heart, Dali had been hospitalized three times since late November.
   A founder of the surrealist movement, Dali, born on May 11, 1904,
in this small Catalonian town. He was the last of an outstanding
generation of Spanish painters that included Pablo Picasso and Joan
Miro.
   His ``Persistence of Memory'' _ with its melting watches and
barren landscape _ is perhaps the world's most celebrated surrealist
painting: a vivid image that became an indelible part of 20th
century culture.
   Miguel Domenech, Dali's attorney, said Dali died ``softly,
without making any special last statement.''
   Condolences came quickly from King Juan Carlos, a personal friend
of Dali, and from Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. Spanish Culture
Minister Jorge Semprun called Dali the ``last of a generation of
creators who revolutionized art in our century.''
   ``The Divine Dali,'' as he liked to call himself, was instantly
recognizable: his pointed, waxed mustache curling up like a bull's
horns, his long hair falling over his neck and one of his more than
30 walking sticks draped over an arm.
   What Dali called his ``sublime craziness,'' began early _ he was
expelled from art school in 1926 for arrogance and briefly jailed
for Catalonian separatist political activities. He said later, ``The
only difference between a crazy person and me is the fact that I am
not crazy.''
   Few critics faulted Dali's technical virtuosity, although his
work was not held in the highest esteem. But he was overwhelmingly
popular: in 1979 and 1980, a major retrospective drew more than a
million visitors in Paris and 250,000 in London.
   To most critics, Dali was a flawed talent _ sometimes managing to
balance realistic technique and irrational content, but all too
often caught up in his own role as a poseur-painter. He completed
most of his critically successful works before he was 35.
   In addition to being a painter, Dali was a decorator, a fashion
and jewelry designer and an author of poetry, prose and essays.
   After being kicked out of the School of Fine Arts in Madrid, Dali
went to Paris and quickly became involved in the surrealist movement.
   The surrealists strove to locate the ``real world'' in the realm
of the unconscious and dreams, removing it from its shell of
``supposed reality.''
   Dali made his mark as co-producer with fellow Spaniard Luis
Bunuel of the 1929 short film ``An Andalusian Dog,'' whose style and
visual violence set a new standard in avant-garde cinema.
   But Dali's exhibitionism and egocentrism provoked the wrath of
his fellows when he claimed ``Surrealism is me.'' At the end of the
1936-39 Spanish Civil War, he was drummed out of the movement as a
``phony'' and an ``archfranquist dilettante.'' Dali made no secret
of his support for the 36-year regime of Francisco Franco.
   With a loan from Picasso, Dali made his first trip to the United
States in 1934 with Gala, the Russian-born woman who became his
faithful companion, muse and the touchstone of his personality and
life.
   Gala Dimitrovna Diaharoff met Dali in 1929 when she and her
husband, French surrealist poet Paul Eluard, visited the painter at
his seaside home on Spain's northeastern Costa Brava.
   At Dali's request, she never left. They married in 1958, six
years after Eluard's death. They had no children _ Dali said
geniuses always produced mediocre children.
   Dali said Gala was ``the woman who always inspired me ... without
her, everything would be over.''
   Gala died June 10, 1982. After her death, the painter said he
chose to remain inside the castle.
   Two years later, a mysterious electrical fire broke out while
Dali slept, sending the painter to the hospital and bringing to
public attention what many termed his near imprisonment by three
close associates. It was never clear why the fire burned several
hours without being noticed when Dali was supposed to have 24-hour
care.
   A. Reynolds Morse, founder of the Salvador Dali Museum in St.
Petersburg, Fla., and a longtime acquaintance of the painter, said
at the time the three had refused him entrance to the castle.
   After the fire, Dali moved into the Galatea Tower attached to his
Theater-Museum in Figueras and remained there, confined to a
wheelchair and fed through a tube. He received a pacemaker in 1986.
   The highest price ever paid for a Dali was the $2.3 million a
Japanese buyer paid in 1987 for a 1974-76 oil on canvas, ``Gala
Looking at the Mediterranean Sea, Which From a Distance of 20 Meters
is Transformed into a Portrait of Abraham Lincoln (Homage to
Rothko).''
   The price pales beside the $38.46 million paid for a Picasso last
November, but Dali himself admitted that from 1964 on he began
signing blank sheets of paper, resulting in a proliferation of Dali
fakes.
   Dali's estate has been estimated at nearly $90 million.
   Xavier Cugat _ a band leader, friend of Dali and fellow Catalan _
told Spanish National Radio that Dali's death could prompt a whole
new round of fakes. ``Because now his works are going to start
showing up like mushrooms and because no one can verify their
authenticity, this is going to be awful,'' he said.
   The painter's body was taken back to his Galatea Tower residence.
Maria Teresa, Dali's housekeeper, said the residence was besieged by
thousands of people who wanted to pay last respects.
   The painter was to lie in state in the tower until his funeral,
scheduled Wednesday afternoon.
   The Theater-Museum, where the artist will be buried, was closed
Sunday so workers could build the tomb. His tomb will be in the
inner court of the museum, just beneath a great glass dome crowning
the building.
   Dali's father wanted him to follow in his footsteps as a notary
public in Figueras, but Dali once said he had one main goal in life
_ to be Dali.
   ``Life would be practically impossible on the globe if there
existed 20 or 30 Dalis,'' he said. ``But there is nothing to fear.
That can never happen.''

   Amnesty International plans no major
protests against the scheduled execution of convicted killer Ted
Bundy as it has for previous electrocutions, but a local group said
Monday it will hold a vigil.
   Bundy is scheduled to be executed Tuesday for the rape and murder
of a 12-year-old girl. He has been convicted of two other Florida
murders as well.
   One of the nation's most notorious criminals, Bundy has been
suspected in the disappearances or murders of 36 young women across
the country, mostly in the Northwest. In recent days, he has
confessed to killing 20 young women in Washington, Utah, Idaho and
Colorado, authorities said.
   Members of the Gainesville Coalition Against the Death Penalty
planned to hold a vigil outside the institution Tuesday, said
Elizabeth Dawson with the Florida Clearinghouse on Criminal Justice.
A few coalition members normally turn out to protest executions.
   About 100 phone calls and several dozen letters and telegrams
have been received at Gov. Bob Martinez's office recently, with most
supporting the governor's push to execute Bundy.
   ``Calls and letters are very, very favorable toward executing
this man as quickly as possible,'' said Brian Ballard, the
governor's director of operations. ``I've heard tell of a few
against capital punishment, but we have not gotten one saying Ted
Bundy is innocent.''
   Most of the missives opposing Bundy's execution are from
supporters of Amnesty International, a worldwide human-rights
organization that opposes the death penalty in all cases and
sometimes mounts high-visibility public opinion drives against
executions.
   Many of the letters protesting the execution are from
out-of-state or overseas and say capital punishment is wrong, said
Ballard. They carry little weight with Martinez because the governor
answers to Florida voters, who support the death penalty, he said.
   Although Amnesty International has mobilized its forces in the
past on behalf of Florida death row inmates, such as Willie Jasper
Darden, who was executed last March despite a worldwide plea for
clemency, the group has mounted only a minimal effort for Bundy.
   ``No, we don't have anything planned'' in the way of a protest,
said Jacqui Hunt, an Amnesty spokeswoman in New York. ``We are doing
with Ted as we do with all people scheduled to be executed. ...
People write letters and telegrams.''
   She said public opinion favoring Bundy's death was not silencing
the organization but that limited funds and staff force the group to
be selective about its battles and to focus on legislative changes.
   ``We believe the death penalty is wrong in all cases,'' she said.
``There aren't many cases that we work on an individual basis
because we don't have the resources and we feel that our time is
better spent in trying to change legislation.''

   Last year's drought is still having some
lingering effect on the nation's dairy farmers, but an Agriculture
Department report said Monday that 1989 milk output still could set
another record.
   ``Drought-caused increases in feed costs probably will have some
effect on milk output in the first half, but 1989 milk production is
likely to total about the same or slightly higher than the year
before,'' the department's Economic Research Service said.
   Milk production rose to a record level of 145.3 billion pounds in
1988, due entirely to a boost of almost 3 percent in milk output per
cow. The number of cows declined by 1 percent to a record low
average of 10.2 million head during the year.
   ``Any (milk) production rises should be easily absorbed by a 1
percent to 3 percent rise in commercial use,'' the report said.
``Government purchases probably will decline to 5 billion to 7
billion pounds, milk equivalent, from 8.8 billion in 1988.''
   The department buys surplus cheese, butter and non-fat dry milk
to support the price of milk paid to farmers by dealers.
   ``A late-1988 surge in domestic commercial use of milk and dairy
products is combining with a vigorous export demand for non-fat dry
milk to create strong dairy markets in early 1989,'' the report said.
   Retail dairy prices rose in December and are higher than they
have been in recent years at this time, the report said. Over all of
1989, retail prices of dairy products are expected to gain an
average of 2 percent to 4 percent, compared with last year's 2
percent.

<HEAD>Defense Says British Fans Not Direct Cause of Riot Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense lawyers argued in court Monday
that British fans who rushed a stand at a soccer match did not
directly cause the deaths in the riot that followed.
   Twenty-six Liverpool fans are charged with manslaughter in the
panic and stampede on May 29, 1985, at Brussels' Heysel Stadium
before a European Soccer Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus
Turin, an Italian team. British fans surged toward an Italian stand,
and 39 people, mostly Italians, were killed in the riot.
   Defense lawyer Harrie Vanbostraeten said his client, Michael
Barnes, was not seen on videotapes of the attack shown in court. The
Belgian lawyer said the 24-year-old Briton could not blamed for
directly causing deaths.
   ``When panic started, the old, crumbling stands on which the
victims tripped and the inefficient police action played a leading
role in causing the tragedy,'' he said.
   Another lawyer, Saskia Pelgrims, spoke Monday for her client,
Gary Cooper, 26.
   ``The victims died choked (in the stampede),'' she said, ``and
you cannot prove objects thrown at them caused their death, neither
can you prove there was a direct contact between the Britons and the
victims.''
   The British fans could be jailed for up to 10 years, but the
prosecutor only asked for a maximum of four years for only 15. The
British defendants were extradited based on videotape evidence.
   Belgian state police officers, the Brussels mayor, his deputy,
and Belgian and European soccer officials are also being tried for
criminal neglect in organizing and controlling the match.
   The trial, which is expected to last several weeks, started Oct.
17.

   European foreign ministers on Monday
approved a plan to impose heavy sanctions on some U.S. imports if
the Bush administration fails to move quickly to end a stubborn
trade dispute over hormone-treated meat from America.
   Ministers of the 12-nation European Economic Community agreed to
slap duties on imports of U.S. walnuts and dried fruit but
indefinitely delayed implementing the tariffs to allow more time to
settle the conflict.
   ``We hope the new North American administration will adopt a more
intelligent attitude,'' said Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco
Fernandez Ordonez.
   He said the newly inaugurated U.S. president, George Bush, is ``a
free trader. I hope he will honor that name.''
   U.S. officials expressed satisfaction that the community delayed
imposing the duties.
   ``We want to make every effort to first contain and then resolve
this dispute, and this decision...is clearly a positive step in that
direction,'' read a statement from the U.S. mission to the trading
bloc.
   But the statement also said officials were ``very concerned''
about the ministers' decision to approve a list of products ``which
could eventually be the target of...counter-retaliation.''
   The Common Market on Jan. 1 banned imports of U.S. meat from
cattle treated with growth hormones, an action affecting about $100
million worth of beef and beef byproducts. European officials
contend the hormones pose a health risk, a claim the United States
disputes. American farmers use the hormones to fatten cattle.
   The United States immediately retaliated by setting about $100
million worth of higher tariffs on a variety of products from the
Common Market, including boneless beef and pork hams.
   The foreign ministers approved their own retaliatory measures,
which would lift duties to 100 percent on U.S. imports of unshelled
walnuts and dried fruit, including apricots, peaches, prunes,
apples, papayas and pears.
   The European Commission, the trading group's executive body, had
asked the ministers to put the counter-measures into effect on Feb.
1.
   But Fernandez Ordonez said the ministers refused to set a date
because they did not want ``to diminish room for maneuvering we have
with the new administration.''
   Still, he said, the ministers decided ``we shall not sit back and
do nothing'' after the United States slapped higher duties on some
European goods.
   Common Market members are: France, West Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland,
Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.

   Salvador Dali, who was among the century's
most important painters and created a public image to match his
surrealist art, died Monday in the town where he was born 84 years
ago.
   The melting watches and wasteland of his dreamscape ``Persistence
of Memory'' made an indelible impression on contemporary culture. It
is probably the most celebrated of surrealist paintings.
   Equally identified with ``The Divine Dali,'' as he liked to call
himself, were the pointed, waxed mustache curling up like a bull's
horns, long hair and a walking stick, of which he owned more than 30.
   Dali, a founder of the surrealist movement, was the last of an
outstanding generation of Spanish painters that included Pablo
Picasso and Joan Miro.
   He died at 10:15 a.m. at Figueras Hospital. His physician, Dr.
Charles Ponsati, said: ``The cause of death was cardiac arrest
brought on by his respiratory insufficiency and pneumonia.''
   Dali had heart problems and had been confined to a wheelchair
since suffering severe burns in a fire at his home in 1984. He was
taken to the hospital five days before his death.
   The painter was born May 11, 1904, to a notary public in this
small Catalonian town. After a life of flamboyance and eccentricity,
his lawyer Miguel Domenech said Dali died ``softly, without making
any special last statement.''
   King Juan Carlos, a personal friend, sent condolences. Culture
Minister Jorge Semprun described Dali as the ``last of a generation
of creators who revolutionized art in our century.''
   What Dali called his ``sublime craziness,'' began early. He was
expelled from art school in 1926 for arrogance and briefly jailed
because of political activities for Catalonian autonomy.
   After becoming famous, Dali said: ``The only difference between a
crazy person and me is the fact that I am not crazy.''
   He also said: ``Life would be practically impossible on the globe
if there existed 20 or 30 Dalis. But there is nothing to fear. That
can never happen.''
   Although few critics faulted Dali's technical virtuosity, they
did not hold his work in the highest esteem. Most felt his was a
flawed talent, sometimes managing to balance realistic technique and
irrational content but too often caught up in his own role as a
poseur-painter.
   Most of Dali's critically successful works were completed before
he was 35.
   Whatever the critics thought, the public adored Dali, who also
was a decorator, fashion and jewelry designer and author.
   A major retrospective in 1979-80 attracted more than a million
visitors in Paris and 250,000 in London.
   After being kicked out of the School of Fine Arts in Madrid, Dali
went to Paris and became involved with the surrealists, who sought
the ``real world'' in the realm of the unconscious and dreams.
   Dali made his cinematic mark as co-producer with another
Spaniard, Luis Bunuel, of the 1929 short film ``An Andalusian Dog.''
The style and visual violence set a new standard in avant-garde
cinema.
   When he claimed ``Surrealism is me,'' Dali's exhibitionism and
egocentrism became too much for his associates.
   At the end of the Spanish civil war in 1939 he was drummed out of
the movement as a ``phony'' and ``archfranquist dilettante.'' Dali
made no secret of his support for Gen. Francisco Franco, who won the
war and ruled Spain for 36 years.
   In Paris on Monday, painter Georges Mathieu, a friend, said Dali
was ``more important as a cosmic genius than as a painter.''
   Jack Lang, French culture minister, said Dali created ``pictoral
work of great philosophical significance, while at the same time
making himself known to a vast public.''
   Kirk Varnedoe, director of painting and sculpture at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York, said Dali ``created some of the most
unforgettable imagery associated with the surrealist movement, but
... may be even more enduringly remembered as a showman.''
   Varnedos spoke of Dali's ``extraordinary theatrical instincts''
and said: ``For those who are concerned with the intermingling in
modern art of the scandalous and the playful, or of psychological
revelation and gadfly irritation, Dali will always be an exemplary
figure.''
   With a loan from Picasso in 1934, Dali made his first trip to the
United States with Gala Dimitrovna Diaharoff, the Russian-born woman
who became his companion, muse and the touchstone of his personality
and life.
   She met Dali in 1929 when she and her husband, French surrealist
poet Paul Eluard, visited the painter at his seaside home in
northeastern Spain.
   At Dali's request, she never left and they married in 1958, six
years after Eluard's death.
   They had no children; Dali said geniuses always produced mediocre
children. He said Gala was ``the woman who always inspired me ...
Without her, everything would be over.''
   Gala died June 10, 1982 and, afterward, the painter said he chose
to remain inside the castle they had built.
   Two years later, a mysterious electrical fire started while Dali
slept, sending him to the hospital and bringing to public attention
what many termed his near imprisonment by three close associates.
   A. Reynolds Morse, founder of the Salvador Dali Museum in St.
Petersburg, Fla., and an acquaintance of long standing, said at the
time the three had refused him entrance to the castle.
   After the fire, Dali moved into the Galatea Tower of his
Theater-Museum in Figueras and remained there, confined to a
wheelchair and fed through a tube. He received a heart pacemaker in
1986.
   The highest price paid for a Dali was $2.3 million by a Japanese
buyer paid in 1987 for a 1974-76 oil on canvas, ``Gala Looking at
the Mediterranean Sea, Which From a Distance of 20 Meters is
Transformed into a Portrait of Abraham Lincoln (Homage to Rothko).''
   That pales beside the $38.46 million paid for a Picasso in
November, but Dali admitted that from 1964 on he began signing blank
sheets of paper, resulting in a proliferation of Dali fakes.
   His estate has been estimated at nearly $90 million.
   His body was returned Monday to the Galatea Tower, where his
housekeeper said thousands of people had gathered. The funeral is
scheduled for Wednesday and Dali will be buried in the
theater-museum's inner court, beneath a great glass dome crowning
the building.

   The statement referred to Reagan's ``obsession'' with the
space-based defense system known as the Strategic Defense

``at the wars he has promoted in Central America, the bombing of
Libya, the invasion of Grenada and the sending of troops to the

   The United States is sending more helicopters
and personnel to help a Peruvian campaign against cocaine
trafficking, the State Department said Monday.
   The addition of four State Department UH1H helicopters will bring
the total involved in the anti-drug campaign to nine, department
spokesman Charles Redman said.
   He also said additional Drug Enforcement Administration agents
are being dispatched to match an increase in Peruvian Civil Guard
personnel involved in operations in the Huallaga Valley, a major
cocaine growing area.
   Redman had no figures but the Washington Post reported in
Monday's editions that 25 to 30 DEA agents will be sent to the area
over the next few months.
   ``The DEA role is to provide advisory assistance in the areas of
intelligence gathering and performance evaluation of Civil Guard
interdiction operations in the Upper Huallaga Valley,'' Redman said.
   He said the DEA accompanies the civil guard on interdiction
operations but only in an advisory role. The Post account said some
senior officials are concerned that U.S. drug agents may become
targets in Peru's prolonged civil war.
   Redman acknowledged that the risk from both traffickers and
leftist insurgents has increased and as a consequence some security
precautions have been taken.
   As an example, some U.S. personnel have been moved to a more
secure location at a Civil Guard base in the Upper Huallaga Valley,
he said.

   The Justice Department's civil rights division
opened a formal criminal investigation Monday into last week's fatal
shooting of a black motorcyclist by a Miami police officer that
touched off rioting.
   Two prosecutors from the criminal section of the Justice
Department's civil rights division were sent to Miami to conduct the
investigation into the Jan. 16 fatal shooting of Clement Anthony
Lloyd, said spokesman Mark R. Weaver.
   The investigators plan to impanel a grand jury this week to study
possible criminal charges against the Hispanic police officer
allegedly involved in the shooting, which touched off three days of
racial rioting in the city's Overtown and Liberty City
neighborhoods, said a government source.
   The Justice Department normally does not impanel a grand jury in
a civil rights investigation unless it plans to seek a criminal
indictment, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The civil rights division was moving quickly into the case
following a preliminary FBI investigation in an attempt to ease
racial tension in Miami, said the source.
   ``I can't confirm that there will be a grand jury this week, but
I can tell you we are moving expeditiously,'' Weaver said.
   The Justice Department's announcement it had begun a formal civil
rights investigation came on the day of Lloyd's funeral.
   The 23-year-old car wash manager died after he was shot in the
head by Officer William Lozano. His passenger, Allen Blanchard, 24,
died the next day of massive head injuries suffered when the
motorcycle went out of control and collided with an oncoming car.
   The incident began when an off-duty policeman, Officer John
Mervolion, tried to stop Lloyd and radioed that he was chasing the
motorcycle.
   The shooting is also being investigated by state and local
authorities as well as an 11-member review board of police and black
community leaders set up following the three days of violence and
looting, which caused one death and left an estimated $1 million

   The Navy on Monday split its fiscal 1989
purchase of Phoenix air-to-air dogfighting missiles, ordering 208
from the Raytheon Co. and 195 from the Hughes Aircraft Co.
   The service, in brief announcements, said it awarded Raytheon's
Missile Systems Division in Bedford, Mass., a firm, fixed-price
contract totaling $140.3 million. Hughes Aircraft, a division of the
General Motors Corp., was awarded a similar firm, fixed-price
contract worth $131.9 million, the Navy added.
   Work under each contract ``is expected to be completed in
September 1991,'' the Navy said.
   Hughes is the developer and prime contractor for the Phoenix, a
long-range, radar-guided missile introduced in 1974. The Navy picked
Raytheon to become a second production source more than two years
ago under a program emphasizing competitive bidding and a broader
industrial base.
   Raytheon previously had been given contracts for 236 missiles in
fiscal 1987 and 1988 in gearing up for production. The Navy
described Monday's awards as representing the results of the first
head-to-head competition between the two companies.
   The Phoenix is carried by only one Navy aircraft _ the frontline
F-14 Tomcat fighter.

<HEAD>Blatt Dismisses Hazing Suit After Settlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge dismissed an $880,000
civil lawsuit stemming from a hazing at The Citadel after attorneys
for the black plaintiff and five white defendants reached a
settlement.
   As part of the agreement, the terms of the settlement will not be
released, attorneys David Norton and Bachman Smith, who represent
the defendants, said Monday.
   The lawsuit, over an October 1986 incident at the military
college, had been expected to go to trial early this year.
   Five white cadets disguised under sheets and towels entered black
cadet Kevin Nesmith's barracks room in the middle of the night.
   The five muttered obscenities and left a charred paper cross
behind. The five, who have since graduated, were ordered to walk 195
hour-long punishment tours with rifles, the harshest penalty in
school history short of dismissal.
   Nesmith, who left the college shortly after the incident, later
sued, charging his constitutional rights, including the right to be
free from racial discrimination, had been violated.
   School officials were dismissed as defendants last month after
U.S. District Judge Sol Blatt Jr. ruled they enjoyed qualified
immunity.
   ``Now that their cases have been settled, I hope the young men
involved can move on with their lives. I wish them all the best,''
college President Maj. Gen. James Grimsley said Monday.
   While Blatt's order issued Friday leaves open the possibility
that Nesmith could reopen the case, a final order is expected in
about two weeks after attorneys sign the agreement, Norton said.
   Blatt's order states the suit is dismissed ``without prejudice to
the right, upon good cause shown within 60 days, to reopen the
action if settlement is not consummated.''
   But Norton said the order is a procedural matter to clear the
docket of the case and that the final order will dismiss the case
with prejudice, meaning Nesmith could not bring it again.
   The five white former cadets named in the lawsuit were Steven A.
Webb, Jeffery D. Plumley, Paul L. Koss, Jimmy M. Biggerstaff and
Maurice F. Bostic Jr. All five graduated from the college last
spring.

<HEAD>Barnes Drops Out of Race for Democratic Chairman, Endorses Brown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Michael Barnes of Maryland dropped
out of the race for chairman of the Democratic Party on Monday and
endorsed Ronald Brown, a former party official who played a key role
in the final stages of Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign.
   ``It is apparent that my candidacy is unlikely to be
successful,'' Barnes said in a letter announcing his decision.
   Barnes' departure from the race left four candidates vying to
succeed Paul G. Kirk Jr. as party chairman: Brown, Michigan party
chairman Richard Wiener, and former Reps. Jim Jones of Oklahoma and
James Stanton of Ohio.
   ``I believe that party unity will be best served if we can unite
behind Ron, a man of proven ability, who has served in numerous
important capacities in our party, including deputy chair,'' said
Barnes.
   ``I'm extremely pleased that Mike Barnes today endorsed my
candidacy,'' Brown said in a statement issued by his campaign staff.
``Mike Barnes is a great asset to our party. ... He has a record of
leadership, a command of issues and a commitment to service. I am
proud of his support.''
   A Washington attorney with close ties to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
of Massachusetts, Brown agreed to serve as Jackson's convention
manager last spring, a move that was hailed by many party leaders
who hoped the Jackson campaign would be less confrontational under
his influence.
   That proved to be true and Brown received a share of the credit
for the show of unity between Jackson and presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis that marked the closing session of the Atlanta
convention.
   But when Brown announced his plan to run for the party
chairmanship, his link to Jackson was seen as a handicap to his
chances.
   With the endorsement of such party leaders as Kennedy, New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo, California Sen. Alan Cranston and Pennsylvania
Gov. Bob Casey, Brown has moved into the role of front-runner in the
race.
   However, the other contenders insisted they would not follow
Barnes' lead.
   ``He wants to stay in,'' said Cindy Cipriani, an aide to Stanton.
``Our tracking shows the race is still open.''
   Brian Lunde, Wiener's campaign manager, questioned whether Barnes
has enough support to make a difference in the race.
   ``He didn't really have any votes to spread around,'' he said.
   The Democratic National Committee will elect the new party
chairman on Feb. 10.

   Sudden acceleration in Cadillac cars made from
1982 through 1988 has resulted in five deaths, a consumer affairs
group said in a petition filed with the government Monday.
   The Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based group, petitioned
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to order a recall
of 1.1 million Cadillacs having HT-4100 4.1-liter V8 engines.
   Altogether, the center said it knows of 120 instances of sudden
acceleration in the Cadillacs, resulting in 63 accidents and 70
injuries.
   ``Victims in many of these cases are pedestrians or bystanders
unable to dodge an out-of-control Cadillac,'' the center said in its
petition. ``Clearly, runaway Cadillacs represent an obvious threat
to the health and safety of not only their occupants but also others
outside the vehicles.''
   The government agency said it would respond to the center's
request within 120 days. A spokesman declined to comment further on
the center's petition.
   A spokesman for General Motors' Cadillac Division in Detroit,
Vince Muniga, said the agency in a broad investigation of GM cars in
1986 ``was unable to pinpoint a common design flaw or manufacturing
defect that could be the root cause for these unwanted acceleration
incidents.''
   ``GM also has investigated these claims and reached the same
conclusion,'' Muniga said. ``We are cooperating fully with NHTSA's
current inquiries, and if the center has any technical information
that would shed light on these incidents, we would certainly like to
see it.''
   The government agency, in response to an earlier petition by the
center, has been investigating since April allegations of sudden
acceleration in front-wheel-drive Cadillac DeVilles and Fleetwoods
made from 1985 through 1988.
   The models included in the center's latest petition are the
1982-1984 DeVilles and Fleetwoods; 1982-1987 Eldorados, Sevilles,
Broughams and Fleetwood Broughams, and 1987-1988 Allantes.
   One of the cars cited in the petition, a 1985 Eldorado, crashed
through the front of a K-mart department store in Belleville, N.J.,
last November, killing two shoppers and injuring 13, the center said.
   In recent years, federal engineers have investigated allegations
of sudden acceleration in about 80 million vehicles made by 10
manufacturers, according to figures compiled by the center.
   About 440,000 cars were recalled as a result of the
investigations, the center said.

<HEAD>Court Appeal Challenges Government on ``Who's a Jew''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of immigrants, including three
Americans, appealed to Israel's Supreme Court on Monday over the
government's refusal to register them as Jews because they were
converted by non-Orthodox rabbis.
   The appeal has again raised the controversial ``Who is a Jew''
question, which was a hot election issue last fall and deeply
angered American and Canadian Jewry.
   The 10 immigrants are asking to be registered as Jews so they may
obtain automatic citizenship or marry. There are no civil marriages
in Israel, and Orthodox rabbis will not marry mixed couples.
   The court case was brought after the Interior Ministry refused to
register the immigrants and instead referred their cases to
rabbinical courts, said Yehoshua Schoffman, an attorney for three of
the immigrants.
   The ministry, headed by an ultra-Orthodox minister, took the
action because the immigrants had been converted by Conservative
rabbis, Schoffman said.
   The immigrants argue that this is against Israel's 1950 ``law of
return.'' The law broadly defines a Jew as anyone born of a Jewish
mother or who has converted and professes no other faith.
   But Orthodox rabbis, who have a monopoly over Jewish religious
life in Israel, have frequently sought to end automatic immigration
rights for Jews converted by rabbis of other streams of Judaism.
   A controversy erupted over the issue last November, when four
religious parties tried to get the government to agree to outlaw
non-Orthodox conversions in exchange for their participation in a
coalition Cabinet.
   The demand raised the ire of American and Canadian Jews, many of
whom are of the Conservative and Reform branches of Judaism.
   The political effort was abandoned when Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir bypassed the religious parties and, instead, formed a
government with the mainstream Labor Party.
   ``Now they are trying to argue that the law doesn't even have to
be changed,'' Schoffman said in a telephone interview.
   Schoffman said one of his clients, Matthew Polomsky, 34, from New
Haven, Conn., was denied registration as a Jew in 1987.
   Polomsky was referred to a rabbinical court, which ordered him to
study Orthodox law before it would consider giving him a conversion
certificate, Schoffman said.
   ``This is illegal,'' Schoffman argued.
   In other cases, immigrants were not registered as Jews for
similar reasons, Schoffman said.
   Interior Ministry spokeswoman Tovah Elinson said it was a
longstanding practice to refer immigrants to rabbinical courts ``if
there is a doubt about whether they are Jewish.''
   ``We do not decide who is a Jew, we only register,'' Elinson
said. She said she could not discuss specific cases while they were
under court appeal.
   The cases were being heard by a five-judge panel headed by
Supreme Court Chief Justice Meir Shamgar.
   The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land, and issues
involving interpretation of the law can be appealed directly to the
supreme court, as was done in this case.
   The Supreme Court last dealt with the issue in a December 1986
ruling that forced the Interior Ministry to register Shoshana Miller
of Colorado Springs, Colo., as a Jew. Ms. Miller was converted by a
Reformed rabbi.

<HEAD>New Snowfall Over Most of West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell from Montana across North Dakota into Wyoming and parts
of Idaho and Nevada on Monday as a new storm system swept into the
West.
   The snowfall was heaviest in northwest Wyoming, where North Folk
received 18 inches of snow, and other mountain areas tallied 4- to
8-inch snowfalls. Billings, Mont., received 2 inches of snow in the
six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST.
   Western Nevada got 1 to 2 inches of snow, and afternoon
snowshowers extended from Montana across North Dakota, northern and
western Wyoming, eastern Idaho and northern Nevada. Western South
Dakota and eastern Montana got freezing rain.
   Winter storm warnings for heavy snow were posted for the
afternoon and evening over south-central and southeast Montana,
western and north-central Wyoming, the eastern mountains of Idaho
and southwestern North Dakota.
   Rain also fell along the North Carolina coast.
   Elsewhere, Green Bay, Wis., and Alpena, Mich., each reached 46
degrees Monday to tie their record highs for the date, set in 1942
and 1967, respectively.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees at Williston, N.D., to 73 at Brownsville, Texas. The morning
low for the nation was minus 19 at Gunnison, Colo.
   Tuesday's forecast called for snow extending from central Montana
across central North Dakota, western South Dakota, Wyoming and Utah.
Snow, with rain in the lower elevations, was predicted for western
Colorado across northwestern Arizona, southern Nevada and southern
California, with cloudy skies over the Plains, the Mississippi and
Tennesse valleys, the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico states.
   High temperatures should range from 10 to 20 degrees over
northern Minnesota, much of the Dakotas, Montana and northern
Wyoming, and into the 30s over northern New England, the upper Great
Lakes, the rest of Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, and the Rockies. Highs
should reach into the 60s from the Carolinas across Florida, the
lower Mississippi Valley, central Texas, and the inland Southwest,
warming into the 70s over southern Florida. Elsewhere, highs should
be in the 40s and 50s.

   Police arrested the owners and
operator of a luxury sightseeing boat that sank on New Year's Eve
near Rio's famous Copacabana beach, drowning at least 55 people,
officials said Monday.
   The owners of the Bateau Mouche IV, Alvaro Pereira da Costa and
Faustino Puertas Vidal, were detained Sunday night along with
Francisco Garcia Riveiro, the owner of the Itatiaia Turismo tourist
agency that chartered the fatal cruise, said police spokesman
Ricardo Gouveia.
   Rio police Commissioner Helio Saboya said the three would be held
in preventive custody to avoid ``the possibility that they would
flee or coerce witnesses.''
   Police must conclude their investigation into the sinking by Feb.
1, Gouveia said.
   The Bateau Mouche IV, with 149 people aboard, rolled over and
sank 15 minutes before midnight Dec. 31 near the base of Rio's
Sugarloaf mountain. The boat was headed for nearby Copacabana beach
for the traditional New Year's Eve fireworks display.
   A Port Authority patrol boat stopped the Bateau Mouche IV soon
after it left port and checked it for possible overloading. After a
brief inspection, the boat was released.
   A survivor claimed she saw one of the Port Authority officials
receive money before leaving the boat. Police on Monday had not
decided whether the woman would be called to testify in the inquiry.
   The navy said the capacity of the Bateau Mouche IV was 153
people. But naval engineers said the double-decked, round-bottomed
boat did not have sufficient weight in its keel and was unstable.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge declared a mistrial Monday for a
defendant in the Operation Cobra drug-smuggling trial, ruling that
questions about his status as a federal informant had to be answered.
   Guillermo Tabraue, 65, was one of 11 people facing racketeering
and drug charges for his alleged part in a marijuana-trafficking
ring that used corrupt police officers in Miami and Key West, and
allegedly killed two people, including a federal informant.
   Final arguments in the 11-week trial were scheduled for Tuesday.
   Guillermo and his son Mario, also a defendant, allegedly were
leaders of the smuggling operation, which prosecutors say used
Mario's exotic animal business as a front for an operation that
imported a half-million tons of marijuana worth $79 million over a
decade.
   On Monday, U.S. District Judge James W. Kehoe ruled that
testimony by a Drug Enforcement Administration agent last week
saying Guillermo had acted as an informant meant his case should be
severed.
   If he had acted as an informant during the time of the acts in
the indictment, it would change his legal status, the judge ruled.
   Guillermo had been free on bond, and he left the courtroom
immediately after the judge's ruling.

   The group that raised a student voice against
drunken driving announced a similar program Monday to combat illegal
drug use by student athletes.
   ``Student athletes are natural leaders and trendsetters in our
high schools and universities. When they stumble, everyone falls,''
said Robert Anastas, founder and executive director of the 4
million-member Students Against Driving Drunk.
   Anastas said the new voluntary program being promoted by the
Marlboro-based SADD is called Student Athletes Detest Drugs and will
use the same technique of students signing pledge cards against
substance abuse.
   Student athletes in the program also will wear the program's logo
on their uniforms as an inspiration to others, he said. Anastas said
he has already tested the program with success at schools in
Missouri, Ohio and Iowa.
   Among those joining Anastas in announcing the program were
several student athletes and high school coaches, and Patrick
Sullivan, general manager of the New England Patriots football team.

<TEXT>
   Scientists are warning that another earthquake
could hit Armenia with the same force as the tremor that caused a
deadly mudslide in Tadzhikistan on Monday, the Tass news agency
reported.
   The Monday quake and resulting landslide in the Soviet Central
Asian republic 1,300 miles east of Armenia killed 1,000 people,
according to preliminary official estimates.
   The Dec. 7 quake in northwestern Armenia killed 25,000 people.
   Tass said underground shocks have been decreasing in the Armenian
regions of Aparan and Razdan and that exploratory wells indicate a
change in ground water level.
   ``Researchers believe these phenomena portend a dangerous release
of energy accumulated in the earth's crust,'' it said Monday.
   It said scientists have warned as a result that an earthquake,
rated 7 on the 12-point Soviet scale, could occur. That was the
force of the quake that caused the Tadzhikistan mudslide, which
wiped out one village and swept through at least two others.
   The Dec. 7 earthquake, which toppled multistory buildings, was
rated in some places as 10 or higher on the Soviet scale.
   Tass said the December quake also shook Aparan, 19 miles
southeast of the epicenter, and Razdan, 37 miles to the southeast.
   Tass said residents of the two regions have been ``warned about
possible shocks,'' but did not say when the scientists believe
another earthquake mayh occur.
   The Soviet scale measures the degree to which a quake is felt in
a given area. On the Richter scale, which measures the energy
released by an earthquake at its epicenter, Monday's quake
registered 5.4 and the December quake registered 6.9.

<HEAD>Yellowstone Receives Cash, Other Forms of Help For Fire Recovery
Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From chain saws to movies,
the American public is coming to the rescue of Yellowstone National
Park to help it spruce up after fires roared across nearly 1 million
acres last year.
   ``Yogi the Bear'' might also join the National Park Service's
effort, although that plan has not been finalized.
   School children, individuals, and major corporations are pitching
in to see Yellowstone recover from the fire storms that involved
995,000 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park.
   As of Monday, the park had received $24,036 in cash contributions
from 408 individuals, groups and schools for fire recovery work.
Another $20,000 was pledged by Conoco Oil Co. for a 30-minute film
titled ``Yellowstone Recovery,'' and 50 chain saws valued at roughly
$20,000 have been promised by Poulan Weed Eater of Shreveport, La.
   ``Obviously, all the forest fires last year throughout the
country drew a great deal of interest from the corporate
officials,'' said Charles Hodges, who works for the Poulan's
advertising firm in Dallas. ``They were looking for ways to help the
Forest Service or Park Service.''
   Those donating may never have been to Yellowstone, but they have
been spurred by a sense that Yellowstone is ``their park,'' said
Duncan Morrow, the Park Service's chief spokesman in Washington, D.C.
   ``I think there's little question of that, that Yellowstone, as
the oldest national park, and one of the ... three or four best
known national parks in this country and possibly even the world,
brings out of people a sense that this is something that they've got
a stake in,'' he said Monday in a telephone interview.
   Some donations have had to be turned down by the Park Service,
such as offers of seedlings that are not native to Yellowstone, he
said.
   Other donations are more unusual, such as the $4,141.41 received
from the USS Yellowstone, which raised the money from sailors who
watched movies for 41 hours and 41 minutes.
   Kindergarten students have donated money raised through bake
sales, nursery school students have sold apples to raise funds for
the park. Pine cones and acorns also have been sent to Yellowstone
from grade school students throughout the country.
   There also have been preliminary talks with Hanna-Barbera, the
producer of the ``Yogi the Bear'' cartoon, on how it might be able
to help the effort.
   The children's donations are being set aside specifically to fund
the ``Children's Fire Trail,'' which will travel through burned and
unburned sections of Yellowstone. Along the path will be signs to
educate children on the effects of fire.
   The trail, expected to cost $126,000, will be dedicated to those
children who donate to it. So far $706 in donations have been
earmarked for the project.
   Conoco's donation went to fund a film of the Yellowstone fires
compiled by Dick Davis, who runs Sportsman Productions, Inc., in
Pineville, La.
   Davis' interest in the fires led him to Yellowstone, where he
talked to park officials about ``doing a television show which would
allow the Park Service to tell its side of the Yellowstone fires.''
   ``Conoco thought it was a good idea, and they provided the
funding,'' he said.
   The film will be distributed to 150 public television stations
and cable networks that reach an estimated 44 million households.
Another 500 copies of the film will be made for distribution to
schools and clubs.
   Yellowstone officials also are seeking funds to fix up trails,
bridges and campsites damaged during firefighting efforts, for
erosion control projects, to buy equipment, for public education
efforts to help visitors understand the fires and fire ecology, and
for research on a variety of subjects relating to the fires.

<HEAD>E. Germany To Cut Armed Forces; Soviet Urges Removal Of Short-range
A-Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany said Monday it will cut its armed
forces by 10,000 soldiers and trim defense spending 10 percent.
   In West Germany, meanwhile, a Soviet official reiterated Moscow's
call for elimination of short-range nuclear weapons from Europe.
   East German leader Erich Honecker said that as part of the
cutback, six tank regiments and an air force squadron would be
mustered out, resulting in a reduction of 600 tanks and 50 warplanes.
   ``At the same time, the national outlay for defense will be
reduced by 10 percent,'' Honecker said.
   Honecker said the cuts would be completed by the end of 1990 to
give the East German army ``an even more defensive character.''
   The surprise move follows an announcement by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev last month that the Kremlin was reducing its
own troop strength, including in Eastern Europe.
   NATO officials have welcomed Gorbachev's initiative but maintain
that the Warsaw Pact would still retain superiority in conventional
forces in Europe.
   East Germany has about 120,000 soldiers, 3,000 main battle tanks
and 350 combat aircraft, according to estimates by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Honecker said the tanks will either be destroyed or converted for
civilian use. He did not elaborate.
   Gorbachev, in a speech to the United Nations in December, said
the Soviets would be pulling 50,000 men and 5,000 tanks from East
Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary over the next two years. It is
believed the Soviets have 500,000 troops in that region.
   Hungary announced earlier this year that it will cut defense
spending by 17 percent in real terms compared with 1988 and Poland
announced plans to cut military outlays.
   East-West negotiations on reducing conventional forces in Europe
are to begin in March in Vienna.
   In West Germany, a high-ranking Soviet official on Monday
repeated Kremlin calls for removal of short-range, or battlefield,
nuclear weapons from Europe but acknowledged such a development
could take time.
   Valentin Falin, head of the international section of the Soviet
Communist Party Central Committee, also indicated Moscow does not
believe the Berlin Wall will be torn down soon.
   ``One single atomic weapon undermines Europe's chance to
survive,'' Falin said in an interview with the Cologne-based
Deutschlandfunk radio.
   NATO officials say withdrawing short-range weapons would leave
Western Europe unprotected from the Warsaw Pact's superiority in
conventional forces.
   Intermediate-range nuclear weapons are being removed from Europe
under a 1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnardze last week said the
Kremlin will remove some of its short-range nuclear arms from
Eastern Europe.
   In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said Monday
that changes in the Soviet Union may signal a new chapter in
East-West ties.
   Political and economic reform under way in the Soviet Union may
indicate that ``we just may be on the verge of a new era in
East-West relations,'' he told the Belgian Atlantic Association.
   Still, he urged the 16 nations of the Western alliance to
maintain a strong defense ``to support continuing dynamism at the
negotiating table and to protect ourselves against any reversals in
Soviet developments, which could yet intervene.''

<HEAD>Bush Speaks To Kohl About Libyan Chemical Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush telephoned Chancellor
Helmut Kohl on Monday and thanked the West German leader for his
determination to prevent German companies from helping produce
chemical weapons, Kohl's spokesman said.
   It was Bush's first overseas conversation with a NATO ally since
taking office, said Friedhelm Ost, Kohl's chief spokesman.
   Bush called Kohl to thank him for the best wishes the West German
chancellor relayed when Bush was sworn in on Friday, Ost said.
   But Bush and Kohl also discussed a scandal that has strained
U.S.-German relations and led to investigations of several West
German companies allegedly involved in what U.S. officials say is a
chemical weapons plant in Libya.
   Ost said that Bush ``thanked Kohl for his determination to
prevent the development and production'' of chemical weapons through
German assistance.
   According to Ost, Bush also said he ``regretted'' commentaries in
American newspapers that harshly criticized West Germany over the
Libyan scandal.
   Ost said Bush told Kohl the commentaries failed to ``take into
account'' the West German government's efforts to prevent the
production of chemical weapons.
   Kohl told Bush about ``the concrete steps'' the West German
government is taking ``to completely resolve all accusations against
German companies and individuals'' involved in the scandal, Ost said.
   Allegations that West German companies were involved in the
Libyan complex first appeared in U.S. newspapers.
   Kohl and other West German leaders at the time expressed anger
over what they called a news media campaign against their
government, creating tensions between Washington and Bonn.
   But West German leaders since have acknowledged that several
German firms were involved in the Libyan plant, although they say no
proof has yet been found that any of the companies broke this
country's export laws.
   West German officials say some of the companies may have been
unwitting participants in the Libyan project or may not have known
the purpose of the factory.
   Libya denies American claims that the factory in Rabta, 60 miles
south of Tripoli, is intended for chemical weapons and say it is
designed to make pharmaceuticals.

<HEAD>Justice Sues Maryland School District</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department filed suit Monday to
enjoin the involuntary transfer of white teachers within a Maryland
public school district to achieve racially balanced faculties.
   The suit by the department's civil rights division marked the
first time the federal government had gone to court to attack
teacher transfer programs, said spokesman Mark R. Weaver.
   The Justice Department charged the Prince George's County school
system _ the nation's 16th largest _ was violating Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 by making teacher assignments according to
race.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, charged the
suburban Washington school system was ``establishing, applying and
maintaining racial quotas for teacher and professional certificated
employees in a manner that unlawfully discriminates on the basis of
race.''
   Specifically, the suit charged that five white teachers were
transferred to other schools instead of less senior black teachers
who taught the same subjects.
   The court action came more than a month after the department
warned the school system in a letter by then-Assistant Attorney
General William Bradford Reynolds that the transfer policy violated
federal civil rights laws.
   The warning to Prince George's school officials was the last
official act taken by Reynolds before he resigned, ending a
controversial tenure as head of the department's civil rights
division.
   Weaver said the department was unaware of any similar
teacher-transfer policies in other public school systems.
   The spokesman said that the the investigation was prompted by
complaints from white teachers in Prince George's County.
   School officials have defended the racial quotas for a
public-school system in which 62 percent of the students and 30
percent of the teachers are black.
   The racial quota to ensure that minority teachers make up between
35 percent and 50 percent of a school's faculty was implemented to
comply with a federal court desegration order, school officials say.
   The lawsuit also attacked as illegal a provision of the school
district's labor-management agreement that limits to 30 the number
of paid sick days women teachers can claim due to disability from
pregnancy.
   The department contended that the policy was discriminatory
because the school system generally allows unlimited sick leave for
other medical conditions, according to the suit.

<TEXT>
   An Iranian newspaper said Monday that Iran
should cooperate with the United States to secure the release of
Americans and Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted the Ettela'at daily of
Tehran as saying, ``When (President) Bush explicitly calls for
cooperation to win the release of Americans held against their will,
why shouldn't we ... use this chance so that Iranian hostages may
also go free.''
   The newspaper was referring to Bush's plea in his inaugural
speech for assistance in securing the release of the American
hostages.
   Nine Americans are among the 15 foreigners missing in Lebanon,
with most believed held by Shiite Moslem groups loyal to Iran.
   The longest held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   Three Iranian diplomats and their Lebanese driver, who also held
an Iranian passport, were kidnapped in 1982 in east Beirut, which is
controlled by the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia.
   ``The period of peace cannot be spent with the same
characteristics and policies as in the period of war,'' the
editorial said.
   IRNA quoted the newspaper as saying Iran gained ``a very
important and costly experience'' during the Iran-Iraq war, when
almost all countries opposed it.
   A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the eight-year war took effect
Aug. 20.

<TEXT>
   A gunman on a motorcycle killed a supreme
court prosecutor Monday night in the third shooting of a leading
court official in two weeks, police said. A left-wing group claimed
responsibility.
   Anastasios Vernardos, 61, was returning from a nearby cafe he
frequented when he was shot twice in the abdomen and three times in
the chest outside his central Athens home. The bright green
motorcycle carrying two men roared away, a police spokesman said.
   Vernardos was pronounced dead on arrival at the Athens Laiko
hopital, doctors said.
   In a statement found about 30 yards from the scene, the May 1
Revolutionary Organization said it was responsible for the attack,
according to the police spokesman, who spoke anonymously in
accordance with Greek practice.
   It was the second attack claimed by the group since it emerged in
1987, when it shot and wounded Greece's top labor leader, Giorgos
Raftopoulos, head of the General Federation of Greek Workers.
   Vernardos was the second of the supreme court's 10 prosecutors to
be shot by terrorist groups in the past two weeks.
   A gunman wounded supreme court prosecutor Panayiotis Tarasouleas,
66, on Jan. 18. An assailant shot Athens investigating magistrate
Constantinos Androulidakis, 52, on Jan. 10. Both men remain
hospitalized in stable condition.
   The leftist November 17 terrorist group claimed responsibility
for both attacks.
   Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou said the attacks on senior
court officials ``aim to intimidate justice.''
   Papandreou said he will hold an emergency meeting with the
ministers of public order, justice and defense and with senior
police officials to discuss the wave of terrorist attacks.
   Little is known about the May 1 organization except for its
Marxist leanings and dislike of Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (PASOK).
   November 17 has claimed 12 killings since it first emerged in
1975 with the assassination of Richard Welch, CIA station chief in
Greece. Among its victims were two senior U.S. officials, several
Greek businessmen, publishers and police officers.
   It is named after the day in 1973 when army troops and tanks
crushed a student uprising against the 1967-74 military dictatorship.
   In proclamations found at the site of its attack on Tarasouleas
on Jan. 18, November 17 said it shot the two court officials because
of their involvement in the acquittal of two conservative
businessmen charged with fraud in the early 1980s.

   John Phillip Huck, the companion and guardian of
comic actress Beatrice Lillie for many years, died one day after the
actress' death, his sister said Monday. He was 66.
   Huck died Saturday after suffering a heart attack while taking a
walk, Georgina Huck said.
   ``John took Bea's death very hard and his heart just gave out,''
Miss Huck said. ``It was a heart attack brought on by the strain of
her death.
   ``He had a slight attack in London some weeks ago and spent 10
days in hospital. He was going to have a triple bypass operation but
it was all too much for him.''
   Miss Lillie, an inspired and unpredictable comic who starred on
Broadway and on British stages for nearly half a century, died
Friday at the age of 94.
   She had suffered a stroke in 1975 and had required constant care.
   Huck's funeral will be combined with Miss Lillie's next week week
at St. Margaret's Church in Harpsden, near Miss Lillie's home at
Henley-on-Thames, Miss Huck said.

   Somalia and Ethiopia are pushing ahead to normalize
relations, Somali Information Minister Abdel-Rasheed Ahmad said
Monday.
   ``They have set up a ministers' committee for this purpose, and
agreed to ... withdraw military forces from the border area,
exchange of prisoners of war and resume diplomatic relations,'' he
told a news conference at the end of a three-day visit to Kuwait by
Somali President Mohammed Siad Barre.
   Somalia and Marxist-ruled Ethiopia last year announced they were
restoring diplomatic ties after an 11-year break and ending disputes
along their border in the Horn of Africa that have lasted more than
a century.
   Ahmed said the agreements were working, and ``we hope more talks
will take place in future to resolve some outstanding problems.''
   He made no mention of the Eritrean rebels, which Somalia has
supported in their fight for independence from Ethiopia.
   Ahmad thanked Kuwait for its economic aid to Somalia and outlined
recent Somali incentives to attract Arab investment.
   He said the measures included ``steps aimed at enchancing
economic openness and allowing the private sector a chance for
serious contribution.''
   Somalia offers opportunities for investment in tourism,
agriculture and fisheries, he said.

Ethics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>EDs: INSERTS new 2nd graf with Bush departure from Oval Office.

<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush set a brisk pace for his new
presidency as he rose before dawn Monday, cautioned White House
officials against ethical lapses and told anti-abortion activists
that the Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion ``was wrong and
should be overturned.''
   On his first full working day, Bush reported to the Oval Office
at 7:21 a.m. and stayed until 6:37 p.m., an 11 hour, 16-minute
workday. He had breakfast with Vice President Dan Quayle, was
briefed by CIA officials on intelligence developments and attended
the swearing-in of his staff _ all before 9 a.m., the usual hour
Ronald Reagan began work.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush usually works
past 5 p.m., whereas Reagan left an hour or so earlier.
   Bush warned his aides that their jobs would be ``a time-consuming
killer'' and said ``the lights burn brightly well after dark around
this place.'' He said he hoped their spouses would understand.
   All of Bush's Cabinet still awaits confirmation, but they were
summoned to the White House for their first official meeting and
group photo. They were briefed on the budget and foreign policy, as
well as his mandate for high ethical standards, Fitzwater said.
   The press secretary issued a statement later saying that during
the Cabinet meeting, chief of staff John Sununu discussed ``major
themes and initiatives to be taken in the weeks ahead.''
   Secretary of State-designate James Baker gave an overview of
foreign policy, telling his colleagues that ``we're going to be very
busy, but we start with a strong hand and a strong America.''
   Making good on a promise, Bush refused to answer reporters'
questions during the photo-taking session with the Cabinet. ``I
think it's a better system this way,'' he said, adding that he would
be available in other forums.
   Following a practice adopted by Reagan, Bush spoke by telephone
hookup in the Oval Office to tens of thousand of anti-abortion
demonstrators on the Ellipse near the White House.
   Bush said he wanted ``to restate my firm support of our cause and
to share with you my deep personal concern about our American
tragedy of abortion on demand.'' He said the Supreme Court's
decision legalizing abortion ``was wrong and should be overturned.''
   Bush, who saw the Reagan administration's reputation tarnished by
questions of ethical lapses, told his staff he wanted them to set a
high standard of conduct.
   He said the guidelines should be ``pride, honesty, spirit of
idealism when it comes to public service, knowing that our actions
must always be of the highest integrity.
   ``It's a question of knowing right from wrong, avoiding conflicts
of interest, bending over backwards to see that there's not even a
perception of conflict of interest,'' Bush said.
   Fitzwater said Bush was not trying to draw a contrast with the
Reagan administration on ethics. ``He simply wants to do it his way
and make the points that he feels are important. ... He is familiar
with the difficulty of inspiring and insuring ethical conduct among
an organization as vast as the 2-million person government.
   ``He simply wants to be on the record and clear about his
feelings from day one,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said Bush would give a similar charge this week to the
bureaucrats in the senior executive service and to the inspectors
general of various departments.
   Bush spent part of the day on the telephone, calling world
leaders to thank them for sending messages of congratulations. He
also expressed interest in cooperating with them in the quest for
world peace, Fitzwater said.
   Among those he talked with were Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Italian Prime Minister Ciriaca DeMita and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   He also spoke with the leaders of India, Pakistan, Argentina and
Finland. In the case of Gorbachev, Bush thanked the Soviet leader
for the warm reception received by his son, Jeb, and grandson,
George P., when they visited earthquake-stricken Armenia, Fitzwater
said.
   Bush invited Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to visit
the White House on Feb. 2 in what likely will be the first meeting
with a foreign leader. Fitzwater said the selection was a
demonstration of a commitment for good U.S.-Japanese relations and
would pave the way for Bush's visit to Tokyo for the Feb. 24 funeral
of Emperor Hirohito.
   Fitzwater said Bush is considering visiting other countries when
he goes to Japan but no decision has been made.
   Fitzwater made clear that Bush will be more unpredictable than
Reagan and said the new president does not feel bound to take a
press pool with him whenever he leaves the White House. ``He does
intend to go by himself to do private things,'' Fitzwater said.
   The press secretary said he would try to have Bush accompanied by
the press whenever there is a scheduled event or official
appearance. However, he added, ``We simply don't know who the
president's going to conduct his life. ... We'll just have to play
his schedule by ear.''

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some city officials called Monday's U.S.
Supreme Court's decision to strike down a program aimed at helping
businesses owned by minorities a ``dark day for human relations.''
   But Councilwoman Carolyn C. Wake welcomed the decision, saying
``I think justice has been done.''
   The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that a city ordinance aimed at
helping construction businesses owned by minorities was an unlawful
form of reverse discrimination. The ordinance required the prime
contractor on any city building contract to subcontract at least 30
percent of the value of the project to firms that are at least
one-half minority owned.
   The ordinance was challenged in 1987 by J.A. Croson Co., an Ohio
firm that was the only bidder on a city project but failed to get
the job because it lacked a minority subcontractor.
   The decision marks ``a dark day for the city, a dark day for the
country and a dark day for human relations,'' Councilman Roy A. West
said.
   The case will have far-reaching effects because 36 states and
about 190 local governments have similar programs, said City Manager
Robert C. Bobb.
   Under the ordinance, up to 40 percent of the city's construction
contracting jobs were awarded to minorities, Bobb said. But since
1987 when the ordinance was struck down by the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, less than 1 percent of the contracts awarded have
been to minorities, he said.
   Unless legislation requires the contractors to seek out
minorities, ``the majority firms are going to continue to work with
those firms they have longterm business relationships with,'' he
said.
   Richmond attorney Walter H. Ryland, who represented Croson, said
Monday's decision was the high court's ``first affirmative action
vote with a majority vote on significant issues.''
   ``An important part of the opinion is the fact that there will
have to be more attention paid to whether the individual has been
identified as a victim of discrimination,'' Ryland said.
   The decision does not prohibit localities from voluntarily
engaging in efforts to end discrimination, said Ryland. ``The court
stopped short of saying you can never do it.''
   Mrs. Wake, who voted against the ordinance in 1983 when it was
approved, said legislating the marketplace is dangerous.
   ``I will work to open the marketplace up to everyone, but then
you have to let the marketplace speak,'' she said. ``That's what
America was built on, and I feel it's working. Minorities are
becoming a very vibrant part of the marketplace and I believe they
will continue to.''
   Councilman Henry L. Marsh III said that after council members
have read the decision, they may try to approve another ordinance
that would meet the court's requirement.
   ``Obviously one of the options available to the city is to adopt
a program that meets the constitutional test of the courts,'' Bobb
said. ``Until we have an opportunity to review the decision, we have
no way to know what the legislation might look like.''

<HEAD>South Africa To Remove 2,300 Police; Proposed Cut In U.N. Force Protested</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa said Monday it is
willing to cut its police force in Namibia by 2,300 officers, and it
named two representatives to help coordinate the territory's
transition to independence.
   At the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and the
non-aligned nations protested any reduction of a proposed
7,500-member U.N. peacekeeping force to oversee the transition. The
OAU expressed worry over South Africa's security forces in Namibia.
   A report from Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to the
Security Council on his recommendations for the size of the
peacekeeping force is due Tuesday, said U.N. spokesman Francois
Giuliani.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia, also known as South-West Africa,
for 74 years. It has agreed to begin implementing a U.N.
independence plan for Africa's last colony on April 1, leading to
elections Nov. 1.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Sunday evening that
his country informed Perez de Cuellar that the Namibian police force
could be cut from 8,300 to 6,000 during the transition period.
   Before Botha's announcement, South Africa had said it would
reduce the police presence to 7,000. Botha said the revision was
made after a ``thorough analysis of the security requirements.''
   South Africa also has an estimated 50,000 soldiers in Namibia but
is required to reduce the figure to 1,500 by the end of June under
the U.N. plan.
   Botha said Monday that Health Minister Willie van Niekerk was
chosen to serve as a coordinator between South Africa and the
various groups in Namibia. Those organizations and individuals
include the current interim government, the South African-appointed
administrator general and the U.N. special representative to
Namibia, Marthi Ahtisaari.
   Willem Retief, South Africa's ambassador to West Germany, has
been named special envoy to Namibia and will assist van Niekerk,
Botha said.
   The United Nations in 1966 revoked South Africa's League of
Nations mandate to govern Namibia.
   Since then, the South-West Africa People's Organization has been
waging a guerrilla conflict for independence. The group is widely
regarded as the favorite to capture the November elections.
   Black African nations and non-aligned countries want the United
Nations to dispatch 7,500 troops at a cost of about $700 million.
However, the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council,
including the United States, will pay most of the cost and want to
limit the force to about 4,500 soldiers.
   The 101-member non-aligned nations group on Monday adopted a
statement saying the ``proposed reductions were contrary to the
letter and spirit'' of a Security Council resolution calling for
cost-saving measures that do not threaten the peacekeepers' ability
to perform their mission.
   A build-up in South African security forces in the last 10 years
underlies the concern of the non-aligned and the Organization of
African Unity, which released a similar statement Monday.
   The OAU statement expressed concern over a cut to 4,000
peacekeepers, while the non-aligned spoke of a cut to 4,500 troops.
Both figures have been discussed as compromises in the past few
weeks.

   Convicted spy Jonathan Pollard began a
five-day fast Monday to protest what he said was improper medical
treatment for his imprisoned wife, Pollard's father-in-law said.
   Pollard, imprisoned at the Federal Penitentiary in Marion, was
angered by the transfer of his wife, Anne, from a Danbury, Conn.,
hospital to a federal prison medical facility at Rochester, Minn.,
said Mrs. Pollard's father, Bernard Henderson.
   Pollard, 34, was sentenced in 1987 to life in prison after he was
convicted of supplying classified U.S. documents to Israeli agents.
His wife, 28, was given a five-year sentence as an accessory to her
husband's illegal possession of the documents.
   Randy Davis, assistant to the warden at Marion, said federal
privacy regulations barred him from confirming whether Pollard had
begun a fast.
   Mrs. Pollard collapsed Jan. 11 at a federal prison work camp at
Danbury, her father said in a telephone interview from New York City.
   She was taken to a hospital for treatment of malnutrition,
dehydration and other symptoms of a gastrointestinal disorder that
left her unable to digest food without the aid of medication, he
said.
   Henderson claimed his daughter was moved from the hospital Jan.
14 before treatments for the disorder had been completed, an action
he called ``reckless endangerment of her life.'' He also said she
has been denied treatment since her transfer to the Minnesota
facility.
   Gregory Bogdan, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, said
Mrs. Pollard was moved ``for medical reasons'' and denied that she
was being mistreated.
   ``She is receiving all the appropriate treatment,'' Bodgan said
from Washington, D.C. ``It just was felt that she would be more
appropriately cared for at Rochester.''
   Henderson also said his daughter was placed on an
around-the-clock suicide watch at the Minnesota facility as ``a
means of harassing her,'' and that a Jewish religious symbol had
been taken from her during the transfer.
   Bogdan said privacy rules prevent him from commenting on specific
aspects of Mrs. Pollard's medical treatment. He said he was unaware
of the alleged theft.
   Henderson said Pollard would take only water for the next five
days to protest his wife's treatment, adding that prison officials
had threatened to force-feed Pollard if he embarked on an indefinite
hunger strike.
   ``It's the only way (Pollard) has to protest this,'' said
Henderson. ``He can't do anything else.''
   Bogdan said Bureau of Prisons policy calls for intervention in a
hunger strike if a prisoner fasts ``to a point where he is
endangering his own safety.''
   Pollard voluntarily ended a four-day hunger strike in July that
he began because he believed his attorneys were being barred from
visiting him.

<HEAD>Jury Sentences Convicted Multiple Murderer To Death</HEAD>

   A jury sentenced a convicted multiple
murderer to death Monday for the slaying of a 19-year-old woman more
than five years ago, the second time he has been sentenced to die
for the crime.
   The jury returned the death sentence against Richard Biegenwald
after six hours of deliberations. The state Supreme Court had
overturned his first death sentence for the slaying of Anna
Olesiewicz because of trial errors and ordered him resentenced by a
new jury.
   Superior Court Judge Patrick McGann ordered Biegenwald be
executed by lethal injection on March 15.
   However, that date will be postponed because all death sentences
must automatically be reviewed by the state Supreme Court. Lawyers
in capital cases have predicted it will be at least six years before
the first New Jersey death row inmate is executed.
   In addition to the Olesiewicz murder, Biegenwald was convicted of
one other murder, and pleaded guilty to two murders of young women
in the Monmouth-Ocean area during the early 1980s. Prosecutors also
suspect Biegenwald in a fifth slaying.
   In his summation, Assistant Monmouth County Prosecutor James
Fagen characterized Biegenwald as ``evil'' and a ``cold-blooded
murderer.''
   He noted that Biegenwald was sentenced to life for a murder
conviction in 1959, but murdered again when he was released on
parole.
   Fagen said Biegenwald had no motive, adding that testimony from
Theresa Smith, the defendant's former lover, ``showed all this man
had on his mind was killing, killing, killing.''
   New Jersey law requires one trial to determine guilt or innocence
and a second trial to determine if a convicted murderer should
receive the death penalty.
   Biegenwald, 48, is the first to go through a second death penalty
trial under New Jersey's 7-year-old capital punishment law.
   Defense attorney Louis Diamond said Biegenwald's beatings as a
child and the harsh treatment he received in pyschiatric hospitals _
including electroshock therapy _ taught him ``that life is
meaningless, death is meaningless.''
   The defense attorney said that if allowed to live, Biegenwald
could be of value to society if studied by psychiatrists who could
possibly find a cause for sociopathic behavior from his case.

   A business professor held hostage in
Beruit for 20 months said Monday the collapse of Lebanese
governmental and economic institutions led to his kidnapping in 1986.
   Mithileshwar Singh, 61, said he hopes President Bush will direct
an effort to ``resolve the problems'' in Lebanon that have brought
the kidnappings of Americans and other foreigners in the strife-torn
country.
   ``Harmony cannot be gained through terrorism and the seizing of
hostages, but I do ask the governments to show more consideration''
of conditions in Beruit, Singh said.
   He said his captors ``have very little consideration for the
freedom of people. We were not allowed to go out of the room. Their
attitude was very commanding. It was, `Be a good hostage. Don't go
over the limit set by us.'''
   Singh said he wouldn't speculate on who was funding the group
that held him prisoner.
   He also declined to answer questions about escape attempts by him
or other hostages. ``I would not like to comment at all about
this,'' he said.
   ``The political process has come to a halt and there is no one to
provide safety and security to the millions of people living in the
country,'' said Singh, who was released by the Islamic Jihad on Oct.
3.
   Singh, who taught at a now-defunct college in Grand Junction for
several years and calls the western Colorado city home, was teaching
at the American University of Beirut when he was abducted Jan. 24,
1986.
   A citizen of India, Singh has been a resident alien in the United
States for more than a decade. He said pressure from the Indian
government, coupled with his age and poor health, were the likely
reasons for his release.
   ``You can say there is no government in Lebanon. Economic
institutions are falling apart,'' Singh said. ``In such a chaotic
condition, the country has become further subdivided into factions.''
   As a result of many factions competing for control of the
country, he said, his kidnappers were able to pose as security
guards at the university.
   Singh said he and about eight other foreign instructors were
invited to a meeting Jan. 24, 1986, by the chief of campus security.
They were to discuss strengthened security and meet new guards hired
by the campus chief, Singh said.
   Instead, Singh and the three other male instructors were
handcuffed at gunpoint and driven to an apartment, the first of 10
places he would be held before he was released.
   ``Our treatment was to some extent acceptable, but some of the
conditions were intolerable and even indescribable,'' he said.
   The captives were kept chained to the floor ``most of the time,''
Singh said. They were freed only for bathroom trips and for transfer
to other apartments.
   ``This caused great emotional and physical hardship,'' he said.
   However, Singh said his captors provided medicine he and other
hostages needed for medical problems and brought him a doctor when
he fell ``greatly sick.''

<HEAD>Quayle Highly Visible on First Workday as Vice President</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to update with more details on Quayle day, including
five presidential meetings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle spent a highly
visible first day on the job Monday, meeting President Bush five
times, swearing in White House staff members and talking with
anti-abortion activists.
   Quayle told the anti-abortion group, representing thousands who
staged their annual demonstration in Washington, the Bush
administration shares their desire to overturn the 1973 Supreme
Court decision which permits abortions.
   he new vice president began his day by having breakfast with Bush
and met him twice later in the day, Quayle press secretary David
Beckwith said.
   At breakfast, the president and vice president discussed topics
including the anti-abortion meeting and the inauguration of
Venezuela's new president, said Beckwith.
   Sources who declined to be named said Bush may send Quayle to the
inauguration in early February and the trip could include stops in
other countries.
   Bush and Quayle met briefly again in the afternoon, at Quayle's
office, but only for a photograph of Quayle signing his name in the
historic vice presidential desk that Bush also used as vice
president. Quayle's predecessors also signed the desk.
   Then Quayle attended an afternoon Cabinet meeting with Bush, and
later met with him privately on a topic that was not disclosed, said
Beckwith.
   The president also asked Quayle to swear in some 65 presidential
assistants in a morning ceremony. Quayle called that ``my first
official duty.''
   In the past, a Supreme Court justice has performed the task, but
Beckwith said Bush wanted Quayle to do it because ``he feels he's a
talented and loyal vice president.''
   Quayle lunched at the White House with Beckwith and other aides.
They talked about such matters as what kind of news coverage Quayle
is getting, concluding it is far better than the negative notices
that marked his entrance on the campaign scene, Beckwith said.
   Quayle's afternoon schedule included an interview with a British
TV crew that is producing a documentary on him and his family.
   At the meeting with anti-abortion activists in the Old Executive
Office Building, Quayle said he had a history of dealing with their
cause in his home state of Indiana. ``I couldn't think of a more
appropriate group to be meeting with,'' Quayle said.
   As to whether the Bush administration can get the Supreme Court
decision on abortion reversed, Quayle replied, ``Time will tell. We
have the same commitment.'' He said it was important that someone
stand up and speak for ``those people who are not yet born.''
   Bush's chief of staff John Sununu accompanied Quayle to the
meeting. One participant said several people told the men they had
``some chagrin'' over Bush's nomination of Louis Sullivan, the
Morehouse School of Medicine president, to be secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services. Sullivan seems ``confused
by this issue'' of abortion, the participant said the activists told
Quayle and Sununu.
   This person, asking not to be named publicly, said Quayle and
Sununu were told that other top positions under Sullivan ``should go
to people who are clearly pro-life.'' He said Quayle and Sununu made
no commitments.
   Bush did not meet with the group, but spoke to a noontime rally
via telephone hookup, as had former President Reagan in past years.
   Quayle is temporarily commuting to Washington from the McLean,
Va., home where he lived as a senator. Renovations on the official
vice presidential mansion are not yet complete.

   Police stormed the Egyptian Bar Association
and arrested a dozen lawyers Monday, police and witnesses said,
after a 12-hour siege in which members rebelled over alleged
mismanagement of funds.
   Helmeted riot police sealed off the association's headquarters
Monday morning after a passerby was wounded by two shots fired from
inside the downtown building. The state-owned Middle East News
Agency said Mohammed Rashad was hit in the chest and arm, but it
provided no further details.
   No other casualties were reported after police ended the siege.
Telephone calls to the building went unanswered and police outside
declined comment.
   The sources said a pistol was found on Ahmed Nasser, a dissident
lawyer and leftist who led the rebellion against Ahmed Khawaga, the
association's chairman.
   Khawaga and Mohammed Sabry, the group's secretary-general, told
The Associated Press the dissenters used automatic weapons in the
episode. Khawaga said the rebel leader also claimed to have
explosives inside.
   The chairman and Sabry said up to 40 dissenters were inside the
association building at the time of the shooting.
   Some members, who oppose Khawaga, have occupied the building
since Thursday.
   Unrest has rocked the union for months. Dissenters accuse
Khawaga's council, elected in 1985, of financial mismanagement that
has cost the association $6 million.
   They complained to judicial authorities, and Khawaga says an
investigation completed in October determined the complaints were
unfounded.
   Riot police and plainclothes security men ringed the building, a
two-story villa at the intersection of two main streets in the
capital's busy shopping area, immediately after the shooting.
Vehicles were diverted from the street where the entrance to the
building is located.
   At least eight police trucks, with a total capacity of about 400
men, were seen parked on nearby streets. The Swiss Embassy and the
nation's principal court complex are a block away.
   The Interior Ministry's top two spokesmen, both police generals,
were not available for comment. Colonels in their offices said they
had no information. The ministry is responsible for domestic
security.
   The association has a membership of 86,000 lawyers nationwide,
25,000 of them in the Cairo area.

   An Air India jumbo jet bound for New York
was diverted safely to Shannon International Airport on Monday after
the pilot was notified of a bomb threat, an airline spokesman said.
   No explosives were found immediately.
   The Boeing 747 with 302 people on board was over the Atlantic off
the west coast of Ireland, an hour and 15 minutes out of London's
Heathrow Airport, when the pilot was alerted.
   He dumped fuel and landed at Shannon at 4 p.m., taxiing to a
secure section of the tarmac, and 279 passengers and 23 crew
disembarked.
   A spokesman for Aer Lingus, the handlers for Air India at
Shannon, said the pilot of Air India Flight 111 was told of the bomb
warning in a communication with his ground control in London.
   ``The call was made to a London taxi firm,'' the spokesman said
on condition of anonymity. ``As far as we understand it the caller
... said there was a bomb on board an Air India flight. This flight
was diverted as a precaution.''
   All baggage was unloaded and checks were made to ensure
passengers identified all the luggage on board. A delay of at least
eight hours was expected, and passengers were taken to local hotels.
   A bomb was suspected of causing the crash of Air India Flight 182
off the south coast of Ireland in June 1985, killing all 329 on
board.

   Thousands of people lined the streets Monday
to welcome home the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers,
cheering, blowing horns and pledging undying loyalty as the team
paraded by on cable cars.
   Coach Bill Walsh clutched the Super Bowl trophy in his hands as
he sat in an open car next to Mayor Art Agnos while the parade
streamed down its route along the historic Market Street.
   Quarterback Joe Montana, most valuable player Jerry Rice and
their teammates waved from the cable cars as dozens of police
motorcycles and squad cars flanked the procession, lights flashing.
   Fans peered from office windows lining the route and jammed 20 or
more deep behind police barricades. Confetti floated down on the
procession as it crept along.
   Early-morning rain threatened to put a damper on the homecoming,
but the skies cleared for the cable cars and convertibles carrying
the victors.
   Monday's parade capped a celebration that began Sunday evening
when Montana threw a touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds
remaining in Super Bowl XXIII.
   That produced a 20-16 victory over Cincinnati, the 49ers' third
championship of the 1980s.
   ``(With) the 49ers at the last minute under pressure, we knew we
had to win,'' said Justina Valencia, 19, who wore a red 49ers
T-shirt and sat in a carload of young girls during Sunday night's
emotional revelry.
   ``I knew in my heart it would be No. 1 Niners in '89. We don't
give up. We're no Miami mice.''
   Sunday's celebration was marred by some bottle-throwing and
fights, and rowdy drunkards accounted for many of the 90 arrests
police reported, said Sgt. Jerry Senkir.
   But it was mostly peaceful jubiliation as fans danced in the
streets, kissed strangers, exchanged high fives, honked their horns
and forced police to close a highway and many city blocks.
   Fans wearing 49ers colors and souvenirs stood in the streets
blowing bullhorns and whistles, while others climbed atop lampposts
and swung from street signs. Screams of ``Niners!'' swept through
the city.
   ``This brings the entire community together,'' said Scott Patton,
holding a bottle of champagne. ``People who wouldn't normally say a
word to each other are hugging and kissing.
   ``And do you know why? Because Joe Montana is God!''
   In the mostly Hispanic Mission District, some fans played
kick-the-can with the remaining half of a stuffed Bengal tiger and
fireworks filled the skies.
   In trendy North Beach, thousands of fans clogged the pavement
near Broadway and Columbus, the traditional center of the city's
celebrations. So many cars filled the area that the Highway Patrol
temporarily closed the Embarcadero Freeway from Broadway to
Interstate 80.
   In the Castro district, spontaneous dancing erupted and rolls of
toilet paper were flung in the air and wrapped around overhead wires.
   Gilberto Cordova, 24, bet $300 on the 49ers in the final four
minutes of the Super Bowl and doubled his money.
   ``It feels rich,'' said Cordova, a San Francisco carpenter. ``It
feels like an extra paycheck, not because of the money but because
of the game and the confidence.''
   Even the police partied.
   Two officers did the ``Ickey Shuffle,'' mocking the dance that
Bengals running back Ickey Woods performs when he scores a
touchdown, something he failed to do Sunday.
   ``Me and my partner here, we're having a good time,'' said
Officer Mike Bolte, 28, of San Francisco.
   The victory parties were not limited to San Francisco. Fans in
other Bay area communities were more restrained in their
celebrations, but they also danced and cheered.
   ``There are only two kinds of football fans,'' observed K.C. Egan
at Bill Bailey's Place in downtown Oakland, ``49ers fans, and those
who wish they were.''

<HEAD>Governor Says David Duke Victory Would Be A Terrible Signal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer warned Monday that if
former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke is elected to the Louisiana
Legislature, the state's image would suffer a blow.
   ``What a terrible signal that would send,'' Roemer said about the
possibility of Duke winning a Feb. 18 runoff for a House seat from a
New Orleans suburb.
   Duke founded the National Association for the Advancement of
White People after leaving the Klan in 1980.
   In a primary Saturday, Duke and fellow Republican John Treen,
brother of former Gov. Dave Treen, were the leaders for the runoff,
with Duke getting 33 percent of the vote to 19 percent for Treen.
   The district in Metairie, a suburban community of New Orleans, is
a stronghold for conservative Republicans.
   ``If it would be a bad image for Louisiana to elect a former
klansman, the U.S. Senate is guilty of promoting a bad image for the
nation,'' Duke said. ``They elected a former klansman in Senator
Robert Byrd to head up the ultraliberal Democratic party.''
   Byrd, the former Senate majority leader, was a member of the Klan
briefly when he was in his 20s, said his press secretary, Tina Evans
on Monday. He joined because he believed it was an anti-communist
organization and he has since called it a youthful mistake that he
regrets, she said.
   Asked about the election results at an impromptu news conference,
Roemer paused and said, ``I'll just speak personally now. Let me
take all of my others hats off. I would be very upset if that (Duke
victory) happened.
   ``But, I tell you the people are going to have to make that
decision. Generally they make the right decisions. ... I just hope
they look it over very carefully.''
   Duke said he's not a racist and it's unfair that his past as an
imperial wizard in the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan is brought up
whenever he's mentioned.
   ``I was never involved in the old Jim Crow system,'' he said. ``I
believe in equal rights for everyone. That's what I've advocated;
that's what I've preached; that's what I believe in.''
   His proposal for incentives to get welfare recipients to accept
sterilization to cut the illegitimate birthrate wasn't a racial
issue, he said.
   ``The media reported it as black illegitimate welfare. I've only
said illegitimate,'' Duke said. ``They're the ones who suppose
illegitimate welfare recipients are black.''
   Although a telephone listing for the Klan still rings at his
home, he said that's just to make it easier to find him.
   ``If he's been disassociated for 10 years, why would he have the
Klan number at his address?'' Treen said. ``If I'd been
disassociated from an organization for 10 years, I don't think I'd
be paying its phone bill.''
   Roemer said he discussed the primary results with several people
but nobody is sure if Duke hit his maximum strength with the 33
percent of the vote.
   ``What can I do?'' Roemer said. ``I think the worst thing would
be for somebody to meddle in the affairs of that district. I've
always been very sensitive to that.''
   Roemer, a Democrat with a strong civil rights background, said he
would help Republican Treen with strategy ``or a shoulder to lean on
or information.''

<TEXT>
   The policeman whose fatal shooting of a black
motorcyclist sparked last week's racial violence was arrested Monday
and charged with manslaughter only hours after the young man's
funeral.
   Meanwhile, the Justice Department's civil rights division began
an investigation into the shooting, and a city panel formed to
review the incident complained it did not have sufficient power.
   Officer William Lozano, 29, was booked into Dade County Jail on
two counts of manslaughter and released after posting $10,000 bond,
said Sgt. Arthur Clemons.
   Lozano was charged in the killings of Clement Lloyd, 23, and
Allan Blanchard, 24. The two were speeding on a motorcycle Jan. 16
in Overtown when Lozano allegedly shot Lloyd in the head. Lloyd died
at the scene and Blanchard, his passenger, died the next day from
injuries suffered in the ensuing crash.
   Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno said a thorough
investigation found that murder charges were unwarranted.
   ``Based on the evidence and applicable Florida law, manslaughter
is the correct charge,'' Reno said. Lozano could face up to 60 years
in prison and a $30,000 fine if found guilty on both charges, she
said.
   Only hours before Lozano's arrest, about 150 relatives and
friends of Lloyd gathered for his funeral at the small Bahman Avenue
Church of God in Opa-locka.
   ``As Martin Luther King said, we live together as rational human
beings or die together as fools _ not only in Miami but all over
America,'' The Rev. Morris Lloyd, the victim's uncle, said in his
eulogy. ``Until something is done to correct our injustices, I
believe a lot more lives are going to be lost.''
   Lloyd's mother and other family members, most immigrants from the
Virgin Islands, wept and cried out as the mourners sang ``Rock of
Ages.''
   The Rev. Dennis Archibald, pastor of the church, noted that the
killing occurred on King's birthday.
   ``It is ironic that Clement ... should be gunned down on the very
day we celebrate the birthday of the founder of the civil rights
movement,'' he said.
   The poor are becoming increasingly frustrated because their needs
are not being addressed, he warned. ``The only language they know
when they are not heard is violence.''
   Two federal prosecutors from the criminal section of the Justice
Department's civil rights division were sent to Miami to investigate
Lloyd's death, spokesman Mark R. Weaver said in Washington.
   The investigators plan to impanel a grand jury this week to study
possible criminal charges against the Hispanic police officer
allegedly involved in the shooting, said a government source in
Washington.
   ``I can't confirm that there will be a grand jury this week, but
I can tell you we are moving expeditiously,'' Weaver said.
   An 11-member independent review panel of police officers and
black leaders, established by the city commission after the rioting,
held its first working session Monday in the now-quiet Overtown
neighborhood where Lloyd was killed a week ago. The shooting ignited
three days of looting and violence.
   City Attorney Jorge Fernandez told panel members that a statute
protecting the rights of police officers, along with conflicting
state and federal investigations, meant that while the review board
can subpoena witnesses, many can legally refuse to testify.
   ``Then if we listen carefully to the statute, ... the policeman's
bill of rights, we really have no power at all,'' said the Rev.
Richard Barry, chairman of the panel. ``Come on now, let's talk
plain talk, not lawyer's talk.''
   The review board is scheduled to make a preliminary report to the
commission Thursday, and members said they want to look more broadly
at underlying social problems in Overtown.
   In the Overtown rioting that followed Lloyd's shooting, one man
died and 11 other people were wounded by gunfire, none seriously.
Fire officials said about $1 million damage was done to structures,
but reports were still being gathered on destruction to building
contents and businesses.
   An apparent new police shooting overnight in the nearby black
neighborhood of Liberty City, where one man had died in looting
during the rioting, was under investigation by Metro-Dade police.
   The victim, David Ford, 20, who allegedly was armed, was in
stable condition Monday at Jackson Memorial Hospital suffering from
two gunshot wounds. Police spokeswoman Lucy Fitts said investigators
were not certain if he was shot by officer Paul Chahal, 26, or by a
second suspect who escaped.
   Police initially said Chahal returned fire at a sniper shooting
at police, but Ms. Fitts said the shots may not have been aimed at
the officers.
   ``We still don't know what happened,'' she said. ``We're waiting
for ballistics tests.''
   The community remained quiet after the incident, she said.
   In the investigation of Lloyd's shooting, Miami police spokesman
Ray Lang said that officer Dawn Campbell, who was present when
Lozano fired at the motorcycle, had given a complete statement to
investigators.
   Blanchard, the motorcycle passenger, was buried Saturday, and his
family called for peace in the community.

   Salvador Dali's best-known painting,
``Persistence of Memory,'' hangs in the Museum of Modern Art in New
York, but hundreds of other works were in his possession when he
died Monday at age 84.
   In addition to the scene of limp watches draped over objects on a
barren landscape, the New York museum owns ``Gala's Angelus'' and
the Metropolitan Museum, also in New York, has ``Corpus
Hipercubicus,'' a large oil of a crucifixion scene with Dali's wife,
Gala, in the background.
   A 1936 work that Dali called in part ``a premonition of the civil
war'' that began in Spain that year, hangs in the Philaledphia
Museum of Art.
   No complete Dali catalogue exists, but experts say the most
authoritative compilation is ``Dali, The Works and the Man'' by
Robert Descharnes, a former French photographer who became the
artist's close associate and principal dealer.
   Dali's theater-museum in Figueras, his hometown in Catalonia, and
the Gala-Dali Foundation he established after his wife's death in
1982 have the works the artist owned.
   The Figueras museum has 116, including the Mae West apartment
with lips as a sofa, nostrils as a fireplace and eyes as two
windows. The Gala-Dali Foundation collection contains 621 paintings,
etchings, prints and scupltures.
   Elsewhere, the largest collection is believed to be in the Dali
Museum in St. Petesburg, Fla., founded by A. Reynolds Morse, an
acquaintance of many years.
   Madrid's Museum of Contemporary Art owns two 1925 paintings of
Dali's sister Ana Maria, showing a young woman with her back turned
looking out a window.
   The Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, housed for a decade in an
annex of Madrid's Prado Museum, contains a Dali dream sequence of
tigers leaping from the mouthes of fish.
   ``The Last Supper,'' painted in 1955, is in the National Gallery
inWashington, and ``The Crucifixion of St. John of the Cross,'' a
1951 work, hangs in the Museum and Art Gallery of Glasgow, Scotland.
   ``Lincoln in Dali Vision,'' a giant nude painting of Gala that
turns into a portrait of Abraham Lincoln when seen at a distance, is
at Figueras along with ``Leda Atomica,'' the painter's version of
the mythical Leda and the swan.
   An oddity in his hometown gallery is ``Rainy Taxi,'' an old black
Cadillac with a fountain inside that is activated by putting a
5-peseta coin in a slot.
   The highest known price for a Dali was $2.4 million in November
1987 for ``The Battle of Tetuan.''

<TEXT>
   A former employee of Noah Robinson
testified Monday that the Chicago millionaire offered him $5,000 to
murder a Greenville woman who witnessed a 1986 slaying allegedly
sanctioned by Robinson.
   Robinson, half-brother of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a Greenville
native, is charged with murder and conspiracy in the death of Leory
``Hambone'' Barber. He also is charged with conspiring to kill
Janice Denise Rosemond.
   Freddie E. Sweeney testified that Robinson ``told me to kill''
Ms. Rosemond. ``He said, `(she) fingered one of our guys.'''
   Published reports have said Ms. Rosemond testified before a grand
jury in Chicago that she witnessed Barber's January 1986 murder in
Greenville. She also reportedly told the grand jury that she saw a
member of the Chicago gang El Rukn at the crime scene.
   In late afternoon testimony, Robinson's former bodyguard and a
high-ranking member of the El Rukn said he received $500 for his
part in the murder. Jackie Clay also said Robinson promised to give
him legal assistance after Greenville police issued a warrant for
his arrest.
   Sweeney allegedly stabbed Ms. Rosemond several times across the
chest on Dec. 4, 1987, a few months after her appearance before the
grand jury.
   Shortly after the attack, Ms. Rosemond recanted her statements
about Barber's death and alleged that prosecutors and police forced
her to testify before the grand jury.
   Sweeney, 35, is charged with assault and battery with intent to
kill in the attack on Ms. Rosemond.
   Robinson, 46, is accused of paying El Rukn members to come to
Greenville to kill Barber, his childhood friend and former employee.
   Sweeney, who worked as a janitor for Robinson in Chicago during
the early 1980s, testified that Robinson ``said he would give me
$5,000 to cut (Ms. Rosemond's) throat because she ratted on us.''
   He testified that during October 1987, he visited Ms. Rosemond
several times. Sweeney said he and Ms. Rosemond took drugs on a
number of occasions.
   Sweeney testified that on Dec. 4 he went to Ms. Rosemond's
apartment and she asked him to come upstairs.
   ``I was sitting in a brown chair and she was lying across the
bed,'' he said. ``...I started thinking about the $5,000 and started
stabbing her.''
   ``Why did you stop?'' asked Solicitor Joe Watson.
   ``I guess I chickened out,'' Sweeney replied.
   Sweeney said he received several payments through a friend who
lived with Robinson in Chicago. The payments stopped, however, and
Sweeney said he decided to turn himself in.
   During cross examination, Robinson's lawyer, Robert Simone, asked
Sweeney to discuss his criminal background.
   Sweeney said he ``shot up a guy's house'' in New York with a
machine gun during the 1970s, sold heroin in New York during the
1970s and stabbed a man ``because he gave me some bad drugs to
sell.''
   Simone tried to discredit Sweeney's testimony, suggesting that he
was on the witness stand ``to get less time'' in prison. Simone said
Sweeney might be bitter because Robinson became a business success,
while he remained ``just a punk.''
   ``Sir, I'm not a punk,'' Sweeney said.

   Salvador Dali, who was among the century's
most important painters and created a public image to match his
surrealist art, died Monday in the town where he was born 84 years
ago.
   The melting watches and wasteland of his dreamscape ``Persistence
of Memory'' made an indelible impression on contemporary culture. It
is probably the most celebrated of surrealist paintings.
   Equally identified with ``The Divine Dali,'' as he liked to call
himself, were the pointed, waxed mustache curling up like a bull's
horns, long hair and a walking stick, of which he owned more than 30.
   Dali, a founder of the surrealist movement, was the last of an
outstanding generation of Spanish painters that included Pablo
Picasso and Joan Miro.
   He died at 10:15 a.m. at Figueras Hospital. His physician, Dr.
Charles Ponsati, said: ``The cause of death was cardiac arrest
brought on by his respiratory insufficiency and pneumonia.''
   Dali had heart problems and had been confined to a wheelchair
since suffering severe burns in a fire at his home in 1984. He was
taken to the hospital five days before his death.
   The painter was born May 11, 1904, to a notary public in this
small Catalonian town. After a life of flamboyance and eccentricity,
his lawyer Miguel Domenech said Dali died ``softly, without making
any special last statement.''
   King Juan Carlos, a personal friend, sent condolences. Culture
Minister Jorge Semprun described Dali as the ``last of a generation
of creators who revolutionized art in our century.''
   What Dali called his ``sublime craziness,'' began early. He was
expelled from art school in 1926 for arrogance and briefly jailed
because of political activities for Catalonian autonomy.
   After becoming famous, Dali said: ``The only difference between a
crazy person and me is the fact that I am not crazy.''
   He also said: ``Life would be practically impossible on the globe
if there existed 20 or 30 Dalis. But there is nothing to fear. That
can never happen.''
   Although few critics faulted Dali's technical virtuosity, they
did not hold his work in the highest esteem. Most felt his was a
flawed talent, sometimes managing to balance realistic technique and
irrational content but too often caught up in his own role as a
poseur-painter.
   Most of Dali's critically successful works were completed before
he was 35.
   Whatever the critics thought, the public adored Dali, who also
was a decorator, fashion and jewelry designer and author.
   A major retrospective in 1979-80 attracted more than a million
visitors in Paris and 250,000 in London.
   After being kicked out of the School of Fine Arts in Madrid, Dali
went to Paris and became involved with the surrealists, who sought
the ``real world'' in the realm of the unconscious and dreams.
   Dali made his cinematic mark as co-producer with another
Spaniard, Luis Bunuel, of the 1929 short film ``An Andalusian Dog.''
The style and visual violence set a new standard in avant-garde
cinema.
   When he claimed ``Surrealism is me,'' Dali's exhibitionism and
egocentrism became too much for his associates.
   At the end of the Spanish civil war in 1939 he was drummed out of
the movement as a ``phony'' and ``archfranquist dilettante.'' Dali
made no secret of his support for Gen. Francisco Franco, who won the
war and ruled Spain for 36 years.
   In Paris on Monday, painter Georges Mathieu, a friend, said Dali
was ``more important as a cosmic genius than as a painter.''
   Jack Lang, French culture minister, said Dali created ``pictoral
work of great philosophical significance, while at the same time
making himself known to a vast public.''
   Kirk Varnedoe, director of painting and sculpture at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York, said Dali ``created some of the most
unforgettable imagery associated with the surrealist movement, but
... may be even more enduringly remembered as a showman.''
   Varnedoe spoke of Dali's ``extraordinary theatrical instincts''
and said: ``For those who are concerned with the intermingling in
modern art of the scandalous and the playful, or of psychological
revelation and gadfly irritation, Dali will always be an exemplary
figure.''
   With a loan from Picasso in 1934, Dali made his first trip to the
United States with Gala Dimitrovna Diaharoff, the Russian-born woman
who became his companion, muse and the touchstone of his personality
and life.
   She met Dali in 1929 when she and her husband, French surrealist
poet Paul Eluard, visited the painter at his seaside home in
northeastern Spain.
   At Dali's request, she never left and they married in 1958, six
years after Eluard's death.
   They had no children; Dali said geniuses always produced mediocre
children. He said Gala was ``the woman who always inspired me ...
Without her, everything would be over.''
   Gala died June 10, 1982 and, afterward, the painter said he chose
to remain inside the castle they had built.
   Two years later, a mysterious electrical fire started while Dali
slept, sending him to the hospital and bringing to public attention
what many termed his near imprisonment by three close associates.
   A. Reynolds Morse, founder of the Salvador Dali Museum in St.
Petersburg, Fla., and an acquaintance of long standing, said at the
time the three had refused him entrance to the castle.
   After the fire, Dali moved into the Galatea Tower of his
Theater-Museum in Figueras and remained there, confined to a
wheelchair and fed through a tube. He received a heart pacemaker in
1986.
   The highest price paid for a Dali was $2.3 million by a Japanese
buyer paid in 1987 for a 1974-76 oil on canvas, ``Gala Looking at
the Mediterranean Sea, Which From a Distance of 20 Meters is
Transformed into a Portrait of Abraham Lincoln (Homage to Rothko).''
   That pales beside the $38.46 million paid for a Picasso in
November, but Dali admitted that from 1964 on he began signing blank
sheets of paper, resulting in a proliferation of Dali fakes.
   His estate has been estimated at nearly $90 million.
   His body was returned Monday to the Galatea Tower, where his
housekeeper said thousands of people had gathered. The funeral is
scheduled for Wednesday and Dali will be buried in the
theater-museum's inner court, beneath a great glass dome crowning
the building.

   Leftist guerrillas fighting the
U.S.-backed government offered Monday to participate in elections
and respect the outcome if balloting is postponed from March to
September.
   The Marxist-led guerrillas, who throughout the 9-year-old civil
wr have rejected elections as a ``farce,'' set several other
conditions in what they termed ``a political proposal to contribute
to peace.''
   Presidential elections are scheduled for March 19. The guerrillas
proposed they be postponed until Sept. 15.
   The government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte was studying the
proposal and had no immediate reaction. The rightist party, Arena,
which is leading the governing Christian Democrats in the polls,
opposes any postponement.
   The rebel proposal is contained in a document signed by the top
five guerrilla commanders. It is to be made public at a news
conference in Mexico City on Tuesday.
   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the proposal on Monday,
the day the document was dated by its signers.
   The insurgents set several conditions in addition to postponing
the election:
   _ Halting what it terms the armed forces' repression of labor and
campesino leaders and of street demonstrations.
   _ Confining military and police personnel to barracks on election
day.
   _ Awarding a seat on the Central Elections Council to the
Democratic Convergence, a leftist electoral alliance whose leaders
have maintained political links to the rebel army, and forming a
watchdog panel to guarantee the integrity of the vote count.
   _ Revising the electoral code through negotiations among all
parties.
   _ Respecting absentee ballots cast by Salvadorans who have left
the country during the war.
   _ Requiring the United States to stay out of the electoral
process and forbidding U.S. aid to any contending party.
   The guerrilla army _ known as the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front _ said it commits itself to the following if the
conditions are met:
   _ Respecting the political activity of all parties and all
government election authorities.
   _ Respecting the lives of mayors, unless the mayors carry out
military-related functions.
   _ A truce beginning two days before the election date and ending
two days after elections.
   _ Participation of what the guerrillas called its ``entire social
base'' in the campaign and election activity. The rebels, who have
boycotted and tried to sabotage previous elections, said they would
call for full participation. They also endorsed the candidates of
the Democratic Convergence.
   _ ``The FMLN would accept the legitimacy of the the electoral
result.''
   _ Continuation of the present Christian Democratic government
until elections are carried out.
   Duarte was cloistered with Roman Catholic Archbishop Arturo
Rivera Damas on Monday afternoon to discuss the guerrilla document.
   The rebels gave Rivera Damas the proposal on Friday in Mexico
City.
   ``The FMLN calls on all the social forces of the country to take
a position on this proposal and expresses its willingness to discuss
it immediately with the government, the Legislative Assembly, the
armed forces and all the political parties,'' the document said.
   The guerrillas said Rivera Damas ``can contribute to the
arrangement of these conversations.''
   ``An electoral process carried out in the conditions we propose
would make possible an irreversible political solution to the
conflict,'' the rebel commanders said.
   The document does not mention any halt to fighting other than the
five-day truce coinciding with the election. The guerrillas have
always maintained that the mere fact of civil war made free and fair
elections impossible.
   It was unclear how they believed legitimate elections could be
staged if fighting continues up to election day.
   The war has killed an estimated 65,000 people, most of them
civilians. Politically motivated slayings of civilians by government
forces, rightist death squads and the guerrillas rose sharply in
1988 compared with the previous year.
   The guerrillas killed nine mayors last year for helping implement
what the rebels term ``the U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency plan.''
Seventy more have resigned after reportedly receiving Front death
threats.
   The Christian Democratic candidate is lawyer Fidel Chavez Mena.
   Alfredo Cristiani is the candidate of the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena. Arena trounced the incumbents in
legislative and municipal elections last March, and are leading the
Christian Democrats in recent polls.
   Armando Calderon Sol, the mayor of San Salvador and a top Arena
leader, told journalists last week his party ``would like the
elections to be held tommorrow.'' The rightists believe they still
have a head of steam from last year's vote.
   Mons. Gregorio Rosa Chavez, San Salvador's auxiliary archbishop,
said after Sunday's Mass the guerrilla proposal was ``interesting''
and expressed the hope it prompts renewed dialogue aimed at ending
the war.
   Three rounds of guerrilla-government peace talks between 1984 and
1987 ended in stalemate.
   The document is signed by Roberto Roca, Shafik Handal, Joaquin
Villalobos, Leonel Gonzalez and Ferman Cienfuegos, the commanders of
the five guerrilla armies that make up the FMLN.

   For the fourth time in 21 months,
residents of this South American country watched with curiosity,
disbelief and anger as violence at an army base threatened their
5-year-old democracy.
   This time, it was not soldiers who challenged the government, but
civilian commandos the government said were leftist guerrillas.
   ``The risk for Argentina is being caught in pincers between the
left and the right,'' said Juan Manuel Cassella, the vice
presidential candidate of the ruling Radical Civic Union in the
elections set for next May 14.
   The assault called to mind not the military insurrections of
April 1987, and January and December 1988, but attacks in the late
1960s and 1970s on army bases by leftist guerrillas such as the
Montoneros and the Peoples Revolutionary Army.
   The commandos either carried with them or stole and put to use
ground-to-ground missiles and anti-tank guns, military officials
said in explaining how 30 to 50 commandos held off hundreds of
soldiers and police backed by tanks and mortars for more than 15
hours.
   In January 1974, about 100 Peoples Revolutionary Army guerrillas
tried to take over the 10th armored cavalry arsenal at Azul, 248
miles south of Buenos Aires. The attack was repulsed.
   In December 1975, the same group attacked Battalion 601 in Monte
Chingolo, 9 miles northwest of the capital.
   ERP, as the so-called revolutionary army is known by its Spanish
acronym, and the Montoneros formed in the late 1960s to oppose the
military regime then in power.
   Their assassinations, bombings and kidnappings continued under
the elected government of Juan Domingo Peron in 1973, destabilizing
it and setting the stage for the military coup of March 1976.
   The new military rulers met the leftist subversion head-on,
fighting ERP guerrillas in the mountains of northwest Tucuman
Province. At least 8,900 Argentines were arrested by security forces
and never seen again. They are presumed executed.
   That so-called ``dirty war'' divides Argentine society to this
day. Military officers charged with human rights abuses say they
used unconventional tactics, including torture, to deal with an
unconventional threat. Human rights groups said the armed forces
committed genocide.
   Five members of the three juntas that ruled from 1976 until
President Raul Alfonsin's election in October 1983 were convicted of
human rights abuses and sentenced to long terms in prison.
   About 20 officers are under prosecution.
   The leaders of the three military insurrections, cashiered Lt.
Col. Aldo Rico and Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, demanded that those
officers convicted be given an amnesty and trials for the others
called off.
   The government and the opposition Peronist Party have refused
both demands. Rico and Seineldin currently are in military prison
awaiting trial.
   All three insurrections ended with little shooting or bloodshed.

   Moore collapsed while riding a city bus Friday and was pronounced
dead of a heart attack at Methodist Central Hospital Friday night.
   He began playing piano in the 1920s and became one of the most
popular musicians in the Deep Ellum blues clubs of Dallas.
   In October 1987, he received the National Heritage Award of the
National Endowment for the Arts.
   Moore recorded with Columbia, Decca, RPM and other labels. He
last recorded an album in 1988 on Rounder Records.
   ``The music is always here when I get ready. I just go and sit
down at that piano and play it. That piano kind of plays itself,''
Moore was quoted as saying in Alan Govenar's recent book ``Meeting
the Blues.''
   He is survived by his son, Alex Moore Jr. A funeral service is

   Soul singer James Brown received a six-year
prison term Monday after pleading guilty to an array of misdemeanor
weapons and traffic charges.
   In addition to the prison term, Brown, who also pleaded no
contest to charges of driving under the influence, was fined $1,000
by Judge Gayle B. Hamrick.
   ``My life has always been a model, and I just don't feel too good
about it now,'' Brown said in court Monday. ``If I had it to do over
again, I just wouldn't do it.''
   Adrienne Brown, the singer's 33-year-old wife, was given
probation and a $600 fine after pleading no contest to a charge of
driving under the influence. It resulted from a September 1987
incident in which she was charged with driving under the influence,
speeding and criminal trespass.
   Brown's sentence would run concurrently with a six-year term he
is serving in South Carolina, Hamrick said. The charges in both
states stemmed from a two-state car chase last September.
   Even though Brown is eligible for parole in South Carolina in
August 1991, under Georgia law he must serve until at least March
1992 on the six-year sentence, said Solicitor Robert W. Hunter III.
   Brown, 55, disrupted an insurance seminar in an Augusta office
building by walking in with a shotgun, officials said. Before
officers could arrive, Brown left the building, and the chase began.
   Brown said in an interview reported Monday in USA Today that he
was ``dealing'' with being in prison.
   ``A lot of people would like to see me fall, but you can't make a
winner a loser,'' he said.
   During his problems last year, he said he was in constant pain
from a series of tooth implants and that he was ``messed up'' on
pain killers.
   ``They catch you and say you're under the influence of drugs,''
he said. ``But doctors, they shoot you up with drugs. You don't know
what you're getting on or what it's going to do.''
   Brown said he spends his time ``autographing 10,000 pictures''
for fellow inmates and their families, and his message to fans is,
``Stay on the good foot and give me your love.''
   Brown pleaded guilty to having no state license tag, reckless
driving, driving with a suspended license, attempting to flee or
elude police, carrying a deadly weapon to a public gathering, simple
assault and improper lane change.
   Brown had a string of hits in the 1960s that defined soul music,
including ``I Got You (I Feel Good),'' ``Papa's Got A Brand New
Bag,'' and ``Cold Sweat.''

<HEAD>131 Iranian POWs Fly Home; U.N. Mediator Arrives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq released 131 sick and disabled Iranian
prisoners of war and the Red Cross flew them back to Tehran, where a
U.N. mediator arrived on a mission to revive stalled peace talks.
   Iran offered no immediate sign that it would reciprocate and
resume prisoner exchanges that ended two months ago, but Iraq said
it planned to free 124 more Iranians on Tuesday.
   The arrival Monday in Tehran of the Iranian POWs was noted in a
brief report by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   ``Baghdad, pressed by world bodies, has relented and set free a
group of Iranian disabled prisoners of war,'' said the agency,
monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   Officials with the International Committee of the Red Cross
supervised the return of the prisoners to Tehran in an airliner
chartered by the Geneva-based agency.
   Red Cross spokesman Juerg Bischoff said there is no indication
the exchange of all sick and wounded prisoners will be resumed soon.
He said the release of the 131 on Monday followed a ``unilateral
decision'' by Iraq.
   He said it came outside a Nov. 11 agreement, which provided for
the immediate return of 1,569 registered POWs to be followed by the
repatriation of all other sick and wounded by the end of last year.
The accord broke down Nov. 27 because of a dispute over the number
of prisoners to be repatriated.
   Fifty-six Iranian and 155 Iraqi POWs were freed before the
exchange broke down.
   Andries Qun, head of the Red Cross mission in Baghdad, told
reporters at the airport that Red Cross officials had also examined
and interviewed the prisoners. He said all were in good condition.
   He did not elaborate, but all the POWs apparently indicated that
they wanted to be returned home.
   ``I'm very happy to be going home,'' said Amosh Toosi, 35, who
said he was captured in the southern battlefront in the early days
of the war.
   ``The war was terrible. I was only told a few days ago that I was
to be repatriated,'' said Toosi, a medical student in the southern
city of Shiraz before the war.
   U.N. special envoy Jan Eliasson, Sweden's ambassador to the world
body, was greeted at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport on Mondasy by Iranian
Foreign Ministry officials, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   An English-language Iranian newspaper said in an editorial Monday
that the deadlocked peace process may take a turn for the worse if
no breakthrough happens soon.
   ``We do not know whether Mr. Eliasson is bringing new proposals
for breaking the ice or whether he will try to persuade Iran and
Iraq on the same old lines,'' it quoted the editorial as saying.
   After his talks in Iran, Eliasson will travel to Baghdad Jan. 27
to discuss the U.N-sponsored peace negotiations with Iraqi
officials, said IRNA.
   A U.N.-mediated cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war took effect
Aug. 20, but peace talks that opened in Geneva five days later under
U.N. auspices broke down immediately. Two more rounds of talks
failed to resolve the deadlock over troop pullouts to prewar borders.
   U.N. Security Council Resolution 598 calls on Iran and Iraq to
halt ``all military activities'' and honor the truce, withdraw
troops to pre-war borders, exchange around 100,000 prisoners of war
and start peace talks.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi prisoners held by Iran
and 19,284 Iranians in Iraqi camps. But U.N. and other officials
estimate the number is far higher and could reach 100,000 held by
both sides.

<HEAD>Habash Expects U.S.-PLO Dialogue To Fail, Criticizes Arafat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FAROUK NASSAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a Marxist Palestinian group
said in an interview published Monday that PLO chief Yasser Arafat
has made too many concessions in his bid to create a Palestinian
state.
   George Habash, who heads the Damascus-based Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, the main opposition faction within the PLO,
also was quoted as saying the PLO's new dialogue with the United
States is bound to fail. But he said he will not try to split the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``Advocates of free-of-charge concessions will find out that this
policy will lead them nowhere,'' Habash said in a full-page
interview with the leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir.
   ``So we are betting that within a year, or say a few months, they
will realize that their policy will not lead to the creation of a
Palestinian state,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The ``free-of cost concessions'' include Arafat's explicit
recognition of Israel's right to exist within secure boundaries on
Palestinian territory and his renunciation of terrorism, the
newspaper quoted Habash as saying.
   ``These moves violated the resolutions of the Palestine National
Council taken in its meetings in Algiers in November,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   The council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile, recommended an
implicit recognition of Israel and a renunciation of terrorism that
also stresses that the ``Palestinians are freedom fighters,'' Habash
was quoted as saying.
   Habash broke with Arafat in 1974 over the issue of a Palestinian
state, but the two later reconciled. Habash now acts as an
opposition spokesman within the PLO, criticizing Arafat but abiding
by the council's decisions.
   It was not until Arafat announced his explicit recognition of
Israel and outright condemnation of terrorism at a U.N. Assembly
session in Geneva Dec. 14 that the United States instructed its
ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau, to open a dialogue with
the PLO.
   Asked about his expections for U.S.-PLO dialogue, Habash said
simply, ``failure,'' As-Safir reported.
   But the newspaper reported Habash still pledged support for
Arafat and said his faction would not leave the PLO.
   ``The uprising is the main common denominator that binds Arafat
and us. We shall allow nothing to weaken the uprising,'' Habash was
quoted as saying.
   He was referring to the 13-month-old uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. More than 360
Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed since the revolt began
Dec. 8, 1987.
   The newspaper said Habash also backed Arafat's declaration at
Algiers of an independent state of Palestine. Although its
boundaries have not been defined, the West Bank and Gaza would be
included.
   ``A Palestinian state on even 10 percent of Palestinian soil is
apt to explode a civil war within Israel,'' Habash was quoted as
saying.
   As-Safir said he predicted that Arafat might make more
concessions so that the symbolic Palestinian state could become a
reality.
   ``Arafat might accept a demilitarized state and might accept
Israeli settlements to remain,'' Habash was quoted as saying. ``He
also might compromise on the PLO demand that Arab Jerusalem be the
capital of the Palestinian state.''
   But the newspaper quoted Habash as saying it was ``difficult to
visualize'' Arafat abandoning his quest to lead a full-scale state
with a ``national flag and a seat at the United Nations''.
   It said Habash also called on Palestinians living inside out
outside the Israeli-occupied territories to prevent the PLO from
being replaced by an official Palestinian government-in-exile.
   Habash was quoted as saying that if a Palestinian
government-in-exile took over the PLO's policy-making role it might
immediately begin negotiations with Jordan to set up a confederation
and then start direct peace talks with Israel.
   ``This will be a grave danger because direct negotiations will
negate the current drive for Arab-Isaeli peace settlement within an
international conference on the Middle East,'' he was quoted as
saying.

   Jurors began deliberations Monday in the trial of
Joel Steinberg, who is accused of beating to death his illegally
adopted daughter in a case that stirred national debate about
responsibility for reporting child abuse.
   State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax finished his
intructions to the jury shortly after noon, telling the panel to
consider lesser homicide charges only if they first acquit Steinberg
of murder.
   Steinberg, 47, is charged in the death of 6-year-old Lisa
Steinberg, the girl he obtained at birth from an unwed teen-ager but
never legally adopted. His lawyers charge that Hedda Nussbaum, 46,
his battered live-in companion, delivered the fatal blow.
   The jury ended its deliberations for the day after almost nine
hours without reaching a verdict, court officials said.
   An alternate juror who was dismissed Monday after she became ill
said she would have voted to convict Steinberg of murder.
   ``I believed Hedda,'' said Sharon Rupert, 50. ``I almost cried
when she left the witness stand.''
   The other four alternate jurors were released shortly before the
12 regular jurors were sent home for the night.
   Rothwax dismissed the alternates because he can not substitute
one of them for one of the regular 12 jurors after the first day of
deliberations without the consent of both the defense and the
prosecution.
   The jury's discussions are almost certain to include Ms.
Nussbaum's seven days of testimony in December. She testified for
the prosecution that Steinberg told her in bed, after they
free-based cocaine and while Lisa lay comatose on their bathroom
floor, that he had ``knocked Lisa down and she didn't want to get
up.''
   But Rothwax also told the jury, ``Hedda Nussbaum is an accomplice
as a matter of law,'' meaning she ``can reasonably be considered to
have participated in the offense charged.''
   As such, the judge said, Ms. Nussbaum's testimony must be
supported by other testimony or evidence in the sensational domestic
violence case, or it would have to be put aside.
   Ms. Nussbaum, initially charged with murder in Lisa's death, made
a deal with the prosecution to testify against Steinberg and charges
against her were dropped.
   The prosecution maintains that Ms. Nussbaum was too physically
and emotionally incapacitated by 12 years of living with Steinberg
to have harmed Lisa. Ms. Nussbaum testified that for most of those
years, Steinberg beat her.
   Rothwax told the jurors that evidence that Steinberg beat Ms.
Nussbaum is not proof he hit Lisa.
   ``You may not, for example, decide that the defendant is a bad
man or is a violent person or has a violent disposition or
propensity, or is otherwise disposed to or more likely to have
committed the crimes charged in the indictment of this (Ms.
Nussbaum's) testimony,'' the judge said.
   Rothwax has said in the past that Steinberg could be convicted of
murder even if they believe his lawyers' assertions that he never
hit the child. The judge has not told the jury this.
   The judge said Steinberg could be convicted of murder if he did
not actually hit Lisa because he had a parental duty to see to her
health and safety. If the jury finds Steinberg knew the child was in
distress and he did not act, then it could find he showed a
``depraved indifference'' to her life.
   Steinberg, a disbarred lawyer, maintained he returned home from
dining out on Nov. 1, 1987, to find Lisa comatose. It is undisputed
that he virtually ignored her as she lay unconscious on their
bathroom floor for several hours.
   Emergency Medical Service workers were not called to the couple's
Greenwich Village apartment until the following morning, and the
child died three days later.
   Lisa's death in an affluent, well-educated househould attracted
wide attention and raised the issue of the responsibility of
neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report
evidence of child abuse.
   Steinberg's lawyers contend Ms. Nussbaum attacked Lisa in a
jealous rage.
   But Assistant District Attorney Peter Casolaro told the jury in
his summation that it was Steinberg, drugged with cocaine and vexed
by the child's growing rebelliousness, who fatally beat Lisa.
   If the jurors believe Steinberg did not hit the girl but they do
not want to return a murder charge against him, they can still
consider first- and second-degree manslaughter and criminally
negligent homicide.
   First-degree manslaughter applies when a person intends to hurt
but not kill somebody but kills the person anyway. Conviction is
punishable by up to 25 years in prison.
   Second-degree manslaughter applies when a person knows or should
know there is a substantial risk of death to others but ignores that
risk.
   Criminally negligent homicide applies when a person negligently
fails to see the risk of death to others and someone dies as a
result.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Turns Down Bundy Appeal</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds three new grafs to explain other votes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court refused Monday night to block
serial killer Theodore Bundy's execution, scheduled for Tuesday
morning in Florida.
   By votes of 5-4, 7-2, and 6-3, the justices rejected emergency
requests aimed at keeping Bundy alive until a formal appeal could be
filed with the nation's highest court.
   The justices had four times previously rejected formal appeals
from Bundy, who is sentenced to die in Florida's electric chair for
murdering a 12-year-old girl in Lake City, Fla., 11 years ago.
   Bundy's lawyers on Monday filed three separate emergency requests
aimed at preventing the execution. The argument which won the
support of four justices argued that jurors were misled about the
importance of their role in determining whether Bundy would receive
the death penalty or life in prison for his crime.
   In Florida, juries in capital cases recommend a punishment, but
the presiding judge is free to accept or reject the recommendation.
   Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun,
and John Paul Stevens voted to spare Bundy's life. The court's
five-member majority voted to let him die.
   The votes rejecting the other two emergency appeals were 6-3 and
7-2.
   Turned down 7-2 was a request to delay the execution until the
high court could hear an appeal claiming that Bundy's death sentence
was tainted because his lawyers were not shown all the information
considered by the sentencing.
   The 6-3 decision rejected a delay based on an alleged flaw which
was almost identical to the argument rejected in the 5-4 vote.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decided secretly to
bar the return of Ferdinand Marcos' body if the ailing former
president dies in exile in Hawaii, an opposition senator said Monday.
   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile told reporters that President Corazon
Aquino and her advisers reached the decision during a recent meeting
of the Cabinet Crisis Committee. He said his source was a Cabinet
member he refused to identify.
   He said the panel decided that Marcos, 71, ``should not be
allowed to return to the Philippines and, even if he should die,
that his cadaver should not be allowed to enter the Philippines.''
   In Honolulu, a hospital spokeswoman said Marcos was improving
Monday but remained in the intensive care unit. He was hospitalized
eight days ago suffering from pneumonia and bronchial asthma.
   Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno confirmed that the Cabinet
had discussed what to do in case Marcos dies abroad.
   Asked whether the government agreed to bar the return of Marcos'
body, Benigno replied: ``I will not be dragged into that. The
national interest is the primary criterion for making decisions.''
   Marcos has lived in Hawaii since a popular uprising toppled his
authoritarian administration in February 1986 and swept Mrs. Aquino
into power.
   Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly refused to allow Marcos to return,
citing national security. Marcos was refused permission to come home
for the funeral of his mother, Josefa, who died May 4.
   Her body remains unburied, and Marcos supporters say the funeral
has been delayed indefinitely pending their leader's return.
   Enrile, who served as Marcos' defense minister for 15 years
before helping engineer his downfall in 1986, said the decision to
bar Marcos' body was made before the former president entered a
Honolulu hospital on Jan. 15 for the third time in little over a
month.
   He suffered a collapsed left lung last Thursday and was reported
later to be in guarded but stable condition. At one point last week,
his lawyers said Marcos was dying.
   Enrile said Marcos' wife, Imelda, and spokesman Gemmo Trinidad
telephoned him during the first week of January ``to enlist my help
to help Marcos come back.'' Enrile did not say if he favors a Marcos
return now.
   Sen. Aquilino Pimentel, who was jailed under the Marcos
administration, said he knew of no decision to bar Marcos' body. If
true, Pimentel said, ``there is an element of paranoia implicit in
that decision.''
   ``I don't think Marcos dead can overthrow the government,''
Pimentel added. ``There's no question, though, that his coming home
would be very emotional.''
   A U.S. federal grand jury indicted Marcos, his wife, Imelda, and
eight other associates on Oct 21, 1988 on racketeering charges.
Marcos faces 39 civil cases in Manila.
   About 2,000 Marcos supporters demonstrated in front of the U.S.
embassy in Manila on Monday, carrying placards that said, ``Bring
Back Marcos Alive.''
   Rafael Recto, a lawyer for Marcos, asked the Bush administration
to be ``compassionate'' and facilitate Marcos' return.

   A gunman stormed a car dealership Monday,
wounding two co-workers when he opened fire on employees and
customers before killing himself, police said.
   The body of Willie Howard Womack Jr., 26, of Virginia Beach, was
found Monday afternoon in a service garage by a police emergency
response team after it lobbed tear gas cannisters inside.
   ``Apparently he died of a gunshot wound to the head,'' said Cpl.
Robert P. Haynes, a police spokesman. ``We're assuming it was
self-inflicted.''
   Womack's body was found near a desk in an office section of the
garage, Haynes said. An AK-47 assault rifle and a two-shot derringer
were found on the desk, he said.
   Police initially believed a third weapon was involved but later
said the gunman apparently used the AK-47 rifle and derringer in the
attack.
   Police said Womack wounded two people inside the Kimnach Ford
dealership early Monday morning in a shooting spree that riddled
many cars and the building with bullets. No motive was known, police
said.
   Body shop manager Barry Graham, 32, was in serious, but stable
condition with a gunshot wound to the leg, said Sentara Norfolk
General Hospital spokeswoman Debbie Myers. Another shop employee,
William Bidlack, 33, was in satisfactory condition, said Sentara
Leigh Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Lisa Pributsky.
   After the initial shooting, Womack, who washed cars in the body
shop, ran out of the building, chasing employees and customers
before running back inside the dealership's garage.
   ``It sounded like firecrackers,'' said Donna Morris, 26, who had
just dropped her car off for repair. ``All of a sudden, the service
doors opened and everybody just came piling out.''
   An employee told her to run because ``somebody had gone berserk
in there with a gun,'' she said.
   Wayne Gravitt, a mechanic at the dealership, described Womack as
a quiet loner.
   ``Nobody really knows him,'' he said.

   Ferdinand Marcos, hospitalized with pneumonia and
bronchial asthma, was feeling better Monday but it was not known
when he would be transferred out of the intensive care unit, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   Marcos, 71, was partly removed from a respirator Monday, but he
was not completely free of the breathing device, said St. Francis
Medical Center spokeswoman Norma Kop.
   Doctors said the former Philippine president's condition was
improving, Kop said. But Marcos would remain in the intensive care
unit at least through Tuesday, she said.
   Marcos was admitted to the hospital eight days ago. He had been
hospitalized twice in December for treatment of congestive heart
failure.
   Marcos' left lung collapsed last Thursday and he was transferred
to the intensive care unit. Doctors reinflated the lung and he has
improved steadily since.
   A hearing on whether Marcos is healthy enough to stand trial on
criminal racketeering charges is to resume in New York on Feb. 9.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, are accused of plundering their
nation's homeland before being toppled in a popular revolt nearly
three years ago. Mrs. Marcos has pleaded innocent to the charges,
while her husband has not yet been arraigned.

   President Bush is turning his attention to
business following a $25 million inaugural extravaganza, with plans
to address anti-abortion demonstrators and preside at his first
Cabinet meeting.
   One item likely to be on the Cabinet agenda is the nation's
staggering budget deficit, which Bush has identified as the No. 1
problem to be addressed in his infant presidency.
   Bush says he will tackle that problem in earnest in his first
week as chief executive and plans to make it the focus of a Tuesday
meeting with congressional leaders.
   The new president, who spent a relatively placid Sunday after
maintaining a breakneck inaugural schedule, planned a flurry of
activity today, meeting with Vice President Dan Quayle and attending
the swearing-in of senior members of the presidential and vice
presidential staffs.

   George Bush is replacing Ronald Reagan's
heavily scripted presidential style with a go-it-alone approach that
has aides scrambling to keep up with his surprise movements.
   ``President on the lawn! President on the lawn! Open coverage!''
a Bush press aide shouted at one point Saturday. It was a sort of
warning to reporters: Here's a man who marches to the beat of his
own drummer.
   Whereas Reagan often would look for the big ``X'' on a stage _
the spot that aides had marked with tape or paint for him to occupy
_ Bush seems determined to pick his own spots.
   Nowhere was the free-flowing style more apparent than in the
inaugural parade that followed Bush's oath-taking on Friday. He
jumped out of his limousine three times to walk and wave.

   ``We are committed to agreement ... But we have to remain free

   The banned trade union federation's statement of acceptance,
issued as its executive committee ended a two-day meeting, was
published by the state-run PAP news agency and broadcast as the

   It clears the way for the first formal talks between Solidarity

1981 military crackdown, interning thousands of union activists.

   Ted Bundy has confessed to 20 more killings,
but Florida's highest law enforcement official calls the condemned
murderer a ``conniver'' who should die in the electric chair as
scheduled.
   Bundy's appointment with a psychiatrist today has generated
speculation that the suspect in up to three dozen slayings will try

intention of delaying the execution beyond Tuesday morning,'' press

   Bundy is scheduled for execution at Florida State Prison on

   But Maj. Gen. Lev Serebrov said Sunday that the Soviets'
withdrawal after nine years in Afghanistan compared favorably with
the U.S. exit from Vietnam.
   ``Your generals ran away from Saigon,'' he told an American

proceeding according to a timetable.''
   Serebrov, dressed in camouflage uniform and chain-smoking, said
Soviet officers were communicating with guerrilla commanders on
parts of the Salang highway, the main route to the Soviet border, to
try to keep it open so supplies can get through to the embattled
Afghan capital.

   A homeless shelter that had expected donations
from an event featuring celebrity chefs instead got the chefs
themselves, preparing a dinner that included crab meat, lamb and
chocolate-covered macadamia nuts.
   ``Obviously, we could use the money and we're sorry that didn't
work out,'' said Mitch Snyder of the Community for Creative
Non-Violence, which runs the 1,400-resident shelter. ``At least
people in our shelter are going to get one nice meal.''
   A commercial event had been scheduled for Saturday night and
Sunday, charging $50 per ticket for Saturday night and $15 for a
Sunday Super Bowl party. The for-profit organization planning it, A
Taste of America, had said it expected to donate $150,000 to
$300,000 from the profits to the homeless shelter.
   The event was canceled late in the week because of last-minute
contract problems with the hall where it was to have been held. But
the chefs were already in town, and they decided since they'd come
to help the homeless, that's exactly what they would do.

   For a teen-ager who attends high school in New
Mexico, Neil Patrick Harris has a rather impressive film career.
   He co-starred with Whoopi Goldberg in ``Clara's Heart'' and was
in the TV movie ``Too Good To Be True,'' with Lonnie Anderson and
Patrick Duffy.
   This Sunday, he co-stars with Barnard Hughes, Robert Prosky and
Sada Thompson in ``Home Fires Burning,'' a Hallmark Hall of Fame
presentation on CBS.
   He plays Lonnie Tibbetts in this drama set in a small Southern
town at the end of World War II. Hughes is his grandfather, Jake
Tibbetts, Ms. Thompson is his grandmother and Prosky plays Jake's
best friend.
   ``My father's been in the war since I was a child,'' Harris said
of his role. ``He's coming home. I live with my grandfather, who's
got a large grudge against my father. My mother was killed, and Jake
blames my father for the accident. I've lived with my grandparents
most of my life, and I have to straighten out things between Jake
and my father.''
   Harris was in Los Angeles with his parents, who are lawyers in
Albuquerque, to promote the show and interview for new projects.
They recently moved there from Ruidoso, N.M.
   Unlike a lot of 15-year-olds, Harris is completely at ease with
people, articulate and seemingly never at a loss for words.
   He described Lonnie as a ``quiet, intelligent boy.''
   ``His Grandpa's almost his best friend,'' he said. ``He's close
with his family, but confused with his mother gone and his father in
the war. It affects him greatly. He's curious, he gets into trouble.
He's pretty much a normal kid.''
   ``Home Fires Burning'' was filmed on location in Crawfordville,
Ga.
   ``It was interesting because of the accents, the food and the
culture,'' he said. ``I've been on location four times, and each
time I had a different guardian. I think once was enough for each of
them. So far it's been my mother, father, grandma and my brother
Brian, who's 18.''
   His first professional job was in an episode of the syndicated
comedy series ``Throb.'' He was also in a movie called ``Purple
People Eater'' with Ned Beatty and Shelley Winters.
   ``It all began when I was 5 or 6 and living in Ruidoso,'' he
said. ``My folks took me to see the national road show of `Annie.' I
fell in love with it. I bought the soundtrack album and the music
book. I was going to be Annie. All I needed was a wig.
   ``I've always loved to watch plays. Whenever I'm in L.A. I go to
the book stores to buy scripts of the latest plays. I love plays. I
was John Darling in `Peter Pan' in Albuquerque. I like the
spontaneity of a play. If you mess up, you have to cover up. And you
always mess up and you cover up and you get applause every night.''
   As much as he wants to do a play, Harris recently turned down an
opportunity to play Jack, of Jack and the Beanstalk, in the road
show of ``Into the Woods.'' The voice required was too low for his
range and it would have kept him away from home for six months.
   ``I think I want to keep acting,'' he said. ``It tickles my
fancy. I'd like to try it as an adult. I'm such a ham. All the
attention is great.''
   He's also turning down TV series offers until after he completes
high school. He's now a sophomore at LaCueva High School in
Albuquerque.
   ``I missed the first month of school,'' he said. ``My teachers
have been very understanding. My classmates have been wonderful,
too. They're amused and very accepting.
   ``I don't have a girl yet, but we have a Sadie Hawkins Day dance
set for the Winter Ball. I hope somebody will ask me. I sit by the
phone and cry.''

<HEAD>HBO to Simulcast Movies in Spanish to Lure Hispanic Viewers</HEAD>

   Sergeant Joe Friday has asked for ``just the
facts'' in many ways over the years, but this month he'll try
something really different: interrogating bad guys in Spanish.
   Dan Aykroyd, the star of the ``Dragnet'' movie, hasn't
transferred to Mexico City. But Hispanics in key cities north of the
border can see a Spanish-language version of ``Dragnet'' on Home Box
Office.
   Some HBO subscribers will be able to choose whether to hear a
Spanish or English soundtrack to ``Dragnet'' and several other HBO
and Cinemax features each month.
   ``There's a very large Hispanic population in this country, about
25 million people, which is equal to the entire population of
Canada,'' said HBO Vice President Dick Beahrs. ``Whereas many of
them speak English as well as Spanish, many of them welcome the
opportunity to use their first language.''
   To hear the Spanish dialogue, a viewer must subscribe to a cable
company using the Spanish audio track and, in most areas, have a
stereo TV with a second audio program switch. A special audio
decoder, costing between $45 and $70, can be added to sets that
don't have the switch.
   There is no extra cost for the Spanish-language feed.
   Twenty-one cable systems in seven markets are taking the Spanish
audio, with 20 more set to start before May, according to HBO's
Concepcion Lara. On board are some systems in and around Los
Angeles, San Diego, Dallas, El Paso, San Antonio, Miami and New York.
   Besides ``Dragnet'', HBO's January Spanish lineup includes
``Empire of the Sun,'' ``Ishtar,'' ``Jumpin' Jack Flash'' and
``Something Wild.'' Cinemax is screening ``Close Encounters of the
Third Kind'' and ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,'' among
others.
   Hollywood movies have been dubbed in Spanish before for Latin
American and U.S. Hispanic theaters, usually months after their
English-language premieres. Recently, more movies have opened in
both Spanish and English simultaneously.
   In 1988, about 50 Hollywood releases, such as ``Oliver and
Company,'' ``Baby Boom,'' and ``Willow,'' were retrofitted with
Spanish sound by Intersound, said Garry Morris, a spokesman for the
dubbing studio.
   About 31 percent of the Hispanic homes nationally take cable,
according to Miami's Strategy Research Corporation, compared to the
53 percent of Anglo households.
   But that might not translate into a boon for HBO.
   Cable channel Galavision began as a pay Spanish-language movie
and entertainment service, but switched to nearly all news last
September. Earlier airings of Spanish-dubbed U.S. movies were
unsuccessful.
   ``We carried `Arthur,' `Superman II' at the same time the other
pay services did,'' said Galavision Vice President Starrett Berry.
``We did not see a huge increase in subscribers as a result of that
arrangement and we ultimately abandoned it.''
   Now the channel is ``looking at bringing back some blocks of
movies,'' Berry said.
   More TV programs in Spanish means more competition for Hispanic
viewers, long used to shows produced in Latin American. Last year
both Univision and Telemundo, the two Spanish-language TV networks,
beefed up U.S. production of programs in Spanish, not dubbed
versions of English-language shows.
   Frank Cruz, vice president and general manager of Telemundo's
KVEA in Los Angeles, said his station had ``very mixed results'' in
showing U.S. films in Spanish. ``We found that our audience
preferred to see Mexican movies, not the dubbed ones,'' he said.
   In New York, Univision President Joaquin Blaya mentioned
unsuccessful efforts by mainstream broadcasters airing Spanish
simulcasts. Last Spring CBS pulled a Hispanic-themed situation
comedy ``Trial and Error'' after a few weeks. The show was Spanish
simulcast on radio in some cities.
   ``If we can judge by history the efforts that have gone to
simulcasting to the Spanish community have not worked,'' said Blaya.
He said Univision stations have aired Spanish-dubbed movies and
``they didn't work either.''
   Nevertheless, KVEA's Cruz applauds HBO's move.
   ``HBO's entry into the Hispanic market is a good sign,'' Cruz
said. ``The more major companies that get into the Spanish-language
market, the better it is for Spanish-language programming across the
board.''

   Thought for Today: ``It was naive of the 19th century optimists
to expect paradise from technology _ and it is equally naive of the
20th century pessimists to make technology the scapegoat for such
old shortcomings as man's blindness, cruelty, immaturity, greed and
sinful pride.'' _ Peter F. Drucker, American government official.

<HEAD>Bush's Offered Hand of Bipartisanship Needs Something in It</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   That outstretched hand President Bush is
offering the Democrats had better have something in it when they sit
down for hard bargaining on the budget.
   The words and the gesture were eloquent, but congressional
Democrats are going to want something more concrete. Bush said what
he wants to bargain about; the question now is what he'll bring to
the table to negotiate with. He's holding his first congressional
leadership meeting at the White House today.
   Bush recalled a time when Congress and administrations worked
together to produce budgets on which the nation could live. ``Let us
negotiate soon _ and hard,'' he said in his inaugural address.
``...The people ... did not send us here to bicker. They ask us to
rise above the merely partisan.''
   But taxes and spending were part of the ammunition Bush aimed at
the Democrats during the campaign that won him the White House. On a
hundred platforms he said Congress would try to force him into
imposing new taxes and he'd say no, ``Read my lips, no new taxes.''
   The targets of Bush's favorite applause line aren't likely to
forget the way it was used against them. They've already said that
Bush will have to narrow the deficit gap without taxes or eat his
campaign words and propose steps to increase revenue.
   Furthermore, the tax question leads to the broader issues of
spending priorities, which embroiled the White House and
congressional Democrats for all eight years of Ronald Reagan's
presidency.
   That put it at the center of political debate, and as vice
president, Bush was a ranking debater. Beginning his presidency, he
proposed another way.
   ``A new breeze is blowing _ and the old bipartisanship must be
made new again,'' Bush said in his address on Friday. ``To my
friends _ and yes, I do mean friends _ in the loyal opposition _ and
yes, I mean loyal _ I put out my hand.''
   Bush said he was reaching out to House Speaker Jim Wright of
Texas, and to Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine,
and he turned to them on the inaugural platform to underscore the
gesture.
   ``... This is the age of the offered hand,'' the president said.
   Bipartisanship historically has been linked to foreign policy,
not to domestic issues like deficit budgets. Republican Sen. Arthur
Vandenberg of Michigan became a symbol of bipartisanship when he
turned from isolationism to support President Harry S. Truman in
major foreign policy moves after World War II.
   Vandenberg said the two-party system was indispensable, but that
the nation's voice should be united ``at the water's edge.'' Bush
used that phrase in his address.
   He then proposed to extend the idea to subjects that don't go
near the water. Taking office before a Capitol dominated by
Democrats _ and almost certain to stay that way throughout his
current term _ he said there should be compromise instead of
dissension, harmony instead of discord.
   ``For Congress, too, has changed in our time,'' said the
president, once a Texas congressman. ``There has grown a certain
divisiveness. We have seen the hard looks and heard the statements
in which not each other's ideas are challenged, but each other's
motives.
   ``Our great parties have often been far apart and untrusting of
each other.''
   The bitter campaign in which Bush defeated Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis added to that mistrust.
   Reagan could afford a hard line with Congress, especially during
his first term. Republicans had won a Senate majority on his
coattails _ it lasted six years _ and he was soaring in the polls.
House Democrats could read numbers. Votes crucial to Reagan's tax
and spending cut programs came from Democrats who were worried about
the political price of opposing him.
   The Bush ticket didn't show that kind of pull and the new
president can't exert that kind of pressure. His Republicans lost
three seats in the House and one in the Senate in 1988.
   Under the circumstances, new-look bipartisanship would be ideal
for Bush if he can get it. He's determined to try. As he put it in a
pre-inauguration interview:
   ``Using Lyndon Johnson's words, maybe different methods, let's
reason together.''

<HEAD>French Government Losing Battle against Franglais</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One recent morning, a newscast on France Inter radio
carried a story about ``le dumping'' by the Japanese on European
markets. The newspaper Liberation had a headline saying a top
politician was in ``les starting blocks'' for coming elections. In
the afternoon, ``un outsider'' won the day's top horse race.
   For years the French government has been battling the creeping
invasion of English without much success. Every time a new French
word is invented, such as ``logiciel'' for computer software, or
``cadreur'' for cameraman, six new Englishisms pop into the language.
   ``Couch potato'' has yet to gain currency in France, but it can't
be far away. An article in Le Monde about American television
introduced the term, calling such a person ``une patate de canape.''
   Most French profess to hate Franglais. On the other hand, most
use it. From morning to night, in newspapers, on radio and in
conversations, one is bombarded with ``le marketing,'' ``un
challenge,'' ``le sponsor,'' ``un leader,'' or ``un self-made-man.''
   Successive governments have made fighting Franglais their
official policy, creating a series of organizations to counter it.
   The most recent is the Commissariat General de la Langue
Francaise, which emerged in 1984 with the job of ``the defense of
the French language.'' The agency has just published the fifth
edition of its dictionary of official neologisms.
   The 2,393 neologisms _ new French words _ in the book are
mandatory for use in all ministries, official correspondence and
documents. But getting the public to accept them is another matter.
The folks at the Commissariat have no enforcement power; usage, not
policy, determines the success or failure of a word.
   ``It is out of the question that we play the role of policing the
language,'' said Bernard Billaud, the Commissariat's chief
wordmaster. ``Our role is to raise consciousness.''
   Many feel that the adoption of foreign words enriches a language,
within limits.
   ``All languages borrow words,'' Billaud said. ``It goes in the
other direction too. It is not so much a problem of borrowing words
as it is a matter of `naturalization' of the word borrowed and the
spirit of the word'' to make it really French.
   Fewer than 2,500 official neologisms is not a particularly
distinguished showing for nearly 20 years of work by the
Commissariat and its predecessors. But word-making is a long process.
   ``We have to consult specialists, find a word, perhaps consult
with the Academie Francaise,'' says Billaud, referring that oldest
of the guardians of the language (it was created by Richelieu in
1635). Billaud also acknowledges that there are ``serious gaps'' in
the dictionary.
   English-speakers are constantly amused by the struggle.
   The Commissariat has decreed that ``un bulldozer''
(bool-doe-zair) will now be a ``bouteur;'' journalists no longer get
``un scoop,'' but an ``exclusivite;'' pilots no longer work in ``un
cockpit,'' but in a ``habitacle.''
   Officialdom also has zapped ``zapping,'' the term used here for
TV-channel jumping. It has replaced it with ``saute-chaine,'' which
literally means ``channel-jump.''
   It has substituted ``tuiteur'' and ``boumeur'' for tweeters and
woofers on stereo sets. But try as it might, it has never been able
to get people to use ``Agetac'' _ the French version of the acronym
GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), and ``bande video
promotionelle'' just doesn't beat ``un clip.'' ``Un clip'' refers to
any promotional video, especially music videos.
   The word factory also has failed to come up with satisfactory
replacements for ``le look,'' when referring to image; ``le stress''
for day-to-day pressure, ``le sandwich'' or ``un blue-jean.''
   Perhaps more unusual are English words that, when absorbed into
French, lose their original meaning, such as ``le forcing,'' which
is to apply pressure, or ``un gadget,'' which can even be applied to
a government minister or program, meaning something just for show.
   The real irony is when English speakers steal a French term, like
``savoir faire,'' and the French retaliate by swiping ``know-how.''
The same can be said of ``rendezvous'' and ``meeting.''
   Worst of all are the sweatshirts and imitation American high
school jackets, where the fashion is to have English words written
on them, no matter how nonsensical, such as ``Athletic Sporting
Team,'' or ``Babie Bear Club.'' Then there's the sweatshirt that
says ``Scoop Entrainement Winter,'' which has no meaning at all and
is a spoof on the proliferation of English words on sweatshirts.
(``Entrainement'' is French for training.)
   Why this fascination with English?
   ``Much of the usage of English is snobbism,'' said Billaud,
speaking in French but slipping into an Englishism _ ``snobbisme,''
which has made its way into the French dictionary.
   ``It takes a psychoanalysis of the French people, who have always
been impressed by what comes from the outside,'' he added. ``It is
evidently a phenomenon resulting from the decline of France in the
world since 1939. France is conscious its influence has diminished.
It is trying to find compensation. English plays this role.
   ``The French want to be modern, and English is a sign of
modernity.''

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of cold-shouldering the United
Nations, the United States now sings its praises and increasingly
suggests things for it to do. But U.S. dollars to match the tasks
are not forthcoming and the United States remains the biggest U.N.
debtor.
   The United States is urging the world body to take on more
responsibilities _ from monitoring the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan and Cuban withdrawal from Angola to fighting terrorism
and drug trafficking and investigating human rights abuses and
chemical warfare.
   It also is expected to monitor the eventual Vietnamese withdrawal
from Cambodia and to play a role in a Middle East settlement.
   But little money is forthcoming from the U.S. Congress to fund
the burgeoning U.S. agenda for the 159-nation organization. The
United States is the largest U.N. contributor, assessed one-quarter
of the annual budget of $800 million.
   While the United Nations has registered a series of formidable
peacemaking and peacekeeping successes that advance U.S. interests,
Congress has been withholding U.S. dues.
   The United States ended 1988 about $402 million in arrears in
budget and peacekeeping dues _ 53.5 percent of the total U.N.
arrears of more than $750 million.
   Largely because of U.S. nonpayment, the United Nations
periodically faces financial crises and is having trouble paying for
new peackeeping operations.
   President Bush, a former U.S. ambassador here, praised the United
Nations during his election campaign and called for the payment of
U.S. dues.
   Congress has been withholding a large part of the dues because of
budget constraints and disaffection with the world body. The
organization was seen as biased against the United States,
bureaucratically bloated and wasteful.
   Some money was withheld in an effort to force the United Nations
to reform itself, despite administration and State Department calls
for full-funding.
   George P. Shultz said before leaving office as secretary of state
said it is important for U.S. foreign policy ``to fully fund our
contributions to U.N. agencies ... and to initiate a plan to pay
arrearages ... over a five-year period.''
   He said the request for nearly full payment of dues ``is critical
to our objectives of resolving regional conflicts. The U.N. can play
an important role in this regard.''
   U.S. Undersecretary of State Richard S. Williamson, in charge of
international organizations, said, ``Up through last year, the
Executive, State Department and White House sought full funding.
Congress failed to appropriate the full amount.''
   In a telephone interview, Williamson said some people ``hold the
United Nations in disrepute when it does disreputable things.'' It
rightfully is criticized, he said, for overspending and for
political moves like a General Assembly resolution equating Zionism
with racism.
   But he said the United Nations has improved because the United
States took a firm stand.
   Last year, the United Nations scored spectacular achievements and
its peacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace Prize.
   In Afghanistan, U.N. observers are monitoring Soviet withdrawal
under a U.N.-mediated agreement. For years, ending Soviet
involvement in Afghanistan was a prime U.S. foreign policy goal.
   In the Persian Gulf, U.N. peacekeepers are monitoring a
cease-fire while Iran and Iraq are talking under U.N. auspices. The
cease-fire enabled the United States to scale back its costly naval
presence there.
   In southern Africa, the United Nations is helping to fulfill
another U.S. goal: getting Soviet-backed Cuban troops out of Angola.
U.N. observers will monitor the Cuban pullout and peacekeepers will
oversee Namibia's transition to independence from South Africa under
a U.N. plan.
   In the Western Sahara conflict, a U.N. peace plan has been
accepted by Morocco, anti-Moroccan guerrillas and Algeria and the
world body will supervise free elections there. In Cyprus, U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has sponsored talks
between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities to discuss
reunification of the Mediterranean island.
   In his final budget, President Ronald Reagan requested nearly
full U.N. funding in the 1990 fiscal year _ $205.5 million for the
regular budget _ plus an additional $46 million to begin paying off
U.S. arrears. The arrears of $403 million include $307.7 million for
the budget and $94.1 million for peacekeeping.
   The Soviet Union has been paying its arrears and now owes $9
million to the regular budget and $172 million to peacekeeping.
   For almost eight years the Reagan administration and the world
body were estranged. The United States charged it was ineffectual,
pro-Soviet, anti-American and wasteful. But in his farewell address
to the General Assembly in September, Reagan praised the world body
for helping to end regional conflicts.

<HEAD>Hinduism, with 330 Million Gods and Goddesses, Confuses Even Hindus</HEAD>

   One holy man walked naked among his
disciples, offering sacred ash, blessings and cardamoms as
consecrated host. Not far away, another holy man delivered a sermon
while dressed in a saffron robe.
   ``Why move naked?'' the second said. ``You can reach God
dressed.''
   A third, who pitched his tent nearby, told his group: ``Dress
does not matter. Ways do not matter. ... Be pure, be good and you
will reach heaven. You need no guru.''
   They were Hindu holy men at the Hinduism's biggest congregation,
the ``Kumbh Mela,'' which began here recently in Allahabad.
   The three holy men, each with different views, were examples of
the diversity of a religion believed to have been practiced since
the third millennium B.C.
   They also showed that Hinduism, with 330 million gods and
goddesses, can be confusing even to Hindus.
   The religion claims a following of 730 million people in India
and Nepal and parts of Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand in Southeast
Asia; Mauritius, in Africa and Fiji in the South Pacific. For
comparison, the Roman Catholic Church claims a following of 850
million.
   An estimated 500,000 holy men and their followers started camping
at Allahabad on Jan. 14, for a seven-week congregation, or fair,
during which 30 million to 40 million pilgrims were expected to take
dips at the ``Sangam,'' the confluence of the three rivers most
sacred to Hindus _ the Ganges, the Jamuna and the Saraswathi.
   The ``Sangam,'' which takes it's name from a mythical fight
between gods and demons over a pot of nectar, is held every 12 years
when Jupiter enters Taurus and the Sun and the Moon are in Capricorn.
   ``You can't explain Hinduism,'' said M.P. Asthana, who has
attended four earlier fairs. ``It is a way of life, where karmas
(the results of deeds) are most important. Even to an average Hindu,
the faith is so confusing.''
   He added: ``No one can explain how we got to acquire and where
are our 330 million gods and goddesses.''
   Believers worship images and statues of gods and goddesses as
well as live animals, including rats. In Hinduism every god has his
steed, or vehicle, and the rat is the vehicle of Ganesha on whom the
elephant-headed, master-of-ceremony god rides.
   Hinduism postulates that everyone goes through a series of
rebirths, or reincarnations, that eventually lead to Moksha, the
spiritual salvation that frees one from the cycle of rebirths.
   ``With each rebirth you can move closer to or further from
eventual moksha,'' said Asthana, who is the spokesman for the state
government of Uttar Pradesh, in which Allahabad is a major city.
   ``The deciding factor is one's karma. Bad actions result in bad
karma, which leads one to lower incarnation and a step further from
salvation.
   ``But if one's actions have been good he or she will reincarnate
on a higher level and be a step closer to eventual freedom from
rebirth.''
   Coming to Allahabad has special significance for Hindus and tens
of thousands come daily to take holy dips at the Sangam, believing
doing this during the auspicious planetary conjugation will wash
away all the sins of a lifetime and release them from the cycle of
births and rebirths.
   ``It is like appearing directly before God for confessions,''
said Jagannath Dwevedi, the chief adminstrator of the fair.
   ``No one knows how bathing will wash off sins, but the belief is
so great that no logic stands.''
   Before taking the dip, pilgrims offer milk and marigolds to the
rivers in a purification ritual and later throw water with their
hands toward the sky, believing that some drops will reach their
ancestors in the heaven.
   ``Now, this sounds like a total nonsense, but people do it,''
said the 56-year-old Dwevedi. ``It is the age-old belief. It is
above logic.''
   Nagas are the naked recluses of Hinduism and they have their own
logic.
   ``Nakedness ends all dichotomy in human life,'' said one,
refusing to give his name. ``We were born naked and therefore should
remain naked and die naked.''
   Fifty-two different religious groups put up sprawling tent homes
at the fair. Each has its own way to reach God. Most of them
constantly smoke marijuana. They say it helps them meditate and
become closer to God.
   ``This makes Hinduism unique,'' said Asthana. ``There is no
restriction on how you reach your goal _ salvation.''
   Only vegetables appear on the fair's menus because devout Hindus
are vegetarians and eating beef is taboo. Hindus worship the cow.

<HEAD>Taiwan Officials Concerned Gambling Will Disrupt Booming Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIRLEY LAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With money pouring from a booming export
business, a lust for gambling has taken hold and turned this
Nationalist Chinese island into a massive underground casino.
Officials say it threatens to disrupt the economy.
   The gambling craze is attributed to the flood of idle cash
created by Taiwan's economic success and of limited investment
opportunities.
   ``It's worse than a huge casino,'' said a dismayed Jaw Shao-kang,
a legislator of the governing Nationalist Party. ``We don't even
have fair gambling rules and decent bookies.''
   Gambling is illegal in Taiwan, but an estimated 2 million people,
or roughly one-tenth the population, play an underground game based
on results of a twice-weekly lottery in nearby Hong Kong.
   They are lured by the chance to win 10 to 500 times their bets,
which typically are 500 Taiwan dollars ($18) or more. Only a tiny
fraction of players, about 6,000 people, were arrested or fined last
year.
   The game became a favorite with farmers, factory workers and
market vendors after the government suspended its own lottery in
1987 to break up underground gambling based on the drawing.
   On Tuesdays and Thursdays, when the Hong Kong lottery is held,
Taiwan's telephone lines are jammed by people calling bookies for
results.
   Gamblers pray to folk gods for winning numbers and often
celebrate at Buddhist temples when they win.
   ``The lottery gamblers have gone too far,'' fumed Ching
Mei-hsien, principal of Taipei's Fu Shing Primary School, which is
near such a temple. ``Their noisy celebrations often disrupt our
students in class.''
   Taiwan's two largest cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung, recently
proposed running their own lotteries to raise funds for social
welfare programs. Cabinet approval is needed for the drawings to
begin later this year.
   Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Taiwanese have turned to gambling
on futures prices on commodity markets in Chicago and New York.
   An estimated 500 local companies, including jewelry shops and
investment firms, accept daily bets totaling about 5 billion Taiwan
dollars ($179 million) based on the movement of futures prices on
the overseas markets, according to Martin Tsai, a financial
consultant with the Alliance International Law Office, which advises
businesses and government agencies.
   Newspapers estimate each company has about 160 clients, meaning
about 80,000 people gamble on commodity prices.
   Even the local stock exchange is widely viewed as little more
than a legal form of gambling. Many inexperienced players such as
housewives, office clerks, retired servicemen and college students
view the market solely as a way to make quick money through
speculation.
   The exchange reported in January that about 1.66 million people
have opened accounts with stock brokers. Trading volume totaled the
Taiwan dollar equivalent of about $280 billion last year, the third
largest in the world after New York and Tokyo.
   On average, each of the total 34 billion shares changed hands
nearly three times last year, even though roughly two-thirds of the
shares were closely held and not for sale.
   Frederick Chien, chairman of the state-run Council for Economic
Planning and Development, believes the gambling craze has changed
traditional values that helped Taiwan improve its economy
dramatically, with per capita annual income in 1988 of 157,400
Taiwan dollars ($5,512), a 56 percent increase from 1983.
   ``So many people are obsessed with speculation,'' Chien said.
``They want to become rich overnight, and they no longer work so
hard for the money.''
   In a recent speech, Economics Minister Chen Li-an said the trend
could eventually erode Taiwan's economic achievement. He complained
that businesmen increasingly prefer the pursuit of quick profit
through gambling and speculation over productive investment.
   Liu Shou-hsiang, an economics professor at Chinese Culture
University in Taipei, said the lack of channels for investment is a
major reason behind the upswing in gambling. Most bonds are
purchased by banks, real estate is too expensive and only a few
mutual funds are allowed.
   The government has taken some steps to help open up new
investment opportunities in recent years, easing foreign exchange
controls to stimulate overseas investment.
   Some Taiwanese still fear overseas investments as an unknown
risk, however, and have been reluctant to diversify.

<HEAD>Trial of Bolivian Strongman Under Way for Three Years</HEAD>

   The trial of former military strongman Luis
Garcia Meza and more than 50 collaborators on murder and corruption
charges has been under way for three years and still has a long way
to go.
   But court officials say they are in no hurry because the trial
itself sends a clear warning signal to others who might plot coups.
   ``This trial sets a precedent for future rulers, and puts the
brakes on criminal acts by bad governments,'' Supreme Court Judge
Julio Urquizu Gutierrez said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
   ``The trial comes at a time when the democratic system is
strengthening. It is thanks to the democracy we are experiencing
that this trial is taking place.''
   Human rights activists say the case also could bolster the
flagging democratic spirits of other South American countries, where
new civilian governments are suffering from declining popularity,
largely because of economic difficulties.
   ``We see that democracies in this part of Latin America are
weakening, as is the case in Peru, Argentina and even Brazil,'' said
Ivan Paz Claros, secretary general of Bolivia's Human Rights
Assembly. ``For this trial to result in a conviction will help
stengthen the democratic process in Bolivia and neighboring
countries.''
   The Human Rights Assembly is party to the trial, ordered by
Congress in 1984 and begun in February 1986. Court officials
estimate it could continue for two or three years more.
   Charges against Garcia Meza, a former right-wing president, and
his collaborators include crimes against the constitution, sedition,
murder, genocide and fraud. Three defendants have died since the
trial began and 54 people in all now are on trial, including six
fugitives being tried in absentia.
   The fugitives, who have been stripped of their citizenship and
property, include the former interior minister, Luis Arce Gomez, who
also is wanted in Miami, Fla., on cocaine trafficking charges.
   Garcia Meza, 57, seized power July 17, 1980, in a military coup
that toppled the civilian government of President Lydia Gueiler
Tejada. The takeover, the fourth in two years, received substantial
backing from the right-wing military junta that then ruled Argentina
and from cocaine traffickers, according to human rights officials.
   Scores of political, labor and church leaders and journalists
were arrested after his coup. Many were tortured and expelled, and
some were killed.
   Garcia Meza vowed to stay in power 20 years, but his harsh rule
quickly became unpopular and reports of high government involvement
in drug smuggling spread. After 13 months, he was forced out by the
military joint chiefs of staff, which named another military officer
as president.
   Popular pressure for a return to civilian rule prompted the
military to call elections in 1982. They were won by Hernan Siles
Zuazo, a civilian who was succeeded three years later by the current
president, Victor Paz Estenssoro. New elections are planned for May.
   Since the trial began, Garcia Meza has been at least officially
confined to the city of Sucre, known for its colonial churches and
plazas, 260 miles east of La Paz, the capital.
   He has become the talk of the town.
   Despite his past, he enjoys the support of many citizens, has
been named godfather at many local baptisms and is invited to
weddings, residents say.
   ``The people in Sucre have received us well, something we did not
expect,'' his wife, Olma, said. ``We have no problems and like
living here, so we may stay here after the trial.'' Garcia Meza
himself refused to be interviewed.
   Mrs. Garcia Meza said her husband was neither a killer nor
power-hungry.
   ``My husband was not aware or responsible for everything that
happened during the coup. He was named president at the request of
the armed forces,'' she added.
   Garcia Meza spends much of his time at a ranch called Duraznillo,
an hour's drive from Sucre, where he trains and sells horses, his
wife said.
   One of Garcia Meza's four lawyers, Daniel Salamanca Trujillo,
said merchants won't take money from the ex-president when he gets a
haircut or has his clothes dry-cleaned.

   Colleges have tried many tactics to
attract capable minority students and make them feel welcome:
offered special scholarships, started support groups, hired
counselors, overlooked low test scores.
   At Gettysburg College, they're about to try genealogy.
   Starting in March, this Lutheran-affiliated liberal arts school
where just 40 of 1,850 students are black is opening an
``intercultural resource center'' where all students, but especially
African-Americans, can learn how to research their family roots.
   The two-story wood-frame center, when it is officially dedicated
at a March 18 ceremony, will coordinate a campus-wide effort to help
minority students develop self-awareness and confidence.
   The ultimate aim: to break down the sense of isolation blacks
often feel on this campus, help them be part of the mainstream and
eventually use their self-awareness to strive for leadership roles.
   Already, the center's bookshelves are packed with state census
records from 40 states dating back to the early 1800s. Thick brown
volumes contain ship passenger and immigration lists dating back to
the 18th century. There are also genealogy guides for Germans,
I.
   The new Gettysburg center is unusual on several counts. Probably
no other school so small has focused such attention on
African-American genealogy, according to James Dent Walker, a
founder of the Washington-based Afro-American Historical and
Genealogical Society. The much larger Temple University in
Philadelphia houses the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American collection
which contains over 40,000 items.
   Second, Gettysburg pointedly chose not to name it an
``Afro-American Center'' or ``Black Student Center,'' as many
colleges have. The idea was to have a place on campus celebrating
all cultures.
   Finally, Gettysburg may be the first college to view genealogy as
a vehicle for recruiting and retaining minority students.
   That strategy may lack the glitz or quick-fix appeal of setting
numerical minority recruitment goals or quotas as other colleges
have, but Gettysburg never did.
   But Matthews says he has already used his approach successfully
as a minority counselor at two other predominantly white campuses,
Northern Michigan University and the affiliated Hobart and William
Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y.
   Now he confidently predicts: ``Gettysburg will end up with a name
across the United States, as a place for the advancement of
African-American and other minority students.''
   Yet Gettysburg seems hardly the most fertile place for an
innovative approach to black student recruitment, despite its
location adjacent to the Civil War battlefield where Abraham Lincoln
delivered his address that became an anthem in the history of race
relations.
   College guides such as the ``Yale Insider's Guide'' have
described Gettysburg's students as ``all alike,'' and ``white and
upper middle-class.''
   The descriptions are ``all too true,'' admits president Charles
Glassick.
   Black students here say that while seldom the target of overt
racism, they often feel shunned and isolated.
   ``Most students here never interacted with blacks, and at
Gettysburg it's possible to avoid that,'' said Michael Warren, a
22-year-old senior majoring in African-American studies.
   ``We were frankly interested in enrolling more minority students.
So we brought in Harry Matthews,'' said Glassick.
   Well under 100 blacks were applying to Gettysburg each year, and
the retention rate of those who attend had been ``abominable,'' said
Glassick. The rate was 46 percent in the 1970s, though that has
recently improved to around 73 percent.
   Even with warm backing by the president and trustees, Matthews'
arrival at Gettysburg in 1985 was not greeted with universal joy.
   ``Did I feel welcome? Hell, no. It was a challenge,'' he told a
visitor.
   ``Some in the faculty and administration were looking for a more
radical guy,'' he said. Some called the conservatively-dressed,
soft-spoken Matthews an ``Uncle Tom.'' Others wondered aloud why
Matthews and his ideas were worth scarce college dollars when they
seemed geared to so few students.
   But when the college spent $450,000 to purchase the building that
eventually housed the center, it became clear to all that the
center, and Matthews, were here to stay.
   Matthews says he faced the same jolting transition that other
black college students often find so trying. He grew up in
Roosevelt, Long Island, a New York suburb where the public schools
are mostly black. He wanted to attend historically black Fisk
University but wound up at the mostly white State University of New
York at Oneonta where financial aid was more generous.
   In 1977, the popularity of ``Roots,'' the book and television
miniseries by Alex Haley, sparked Matthews' passion for genealogy.
``When ``Roots'' came out, I made a pledge to trace my family before
I had children,'' he said, a vow he has kept.
   Eleven years of subsequent research led him to discover ancestors
dating back to the American Revolution. He believes his oldest
ancestor was a freedman known as Isaac the African who served in the
3rd Regiment of South Carolina.
   The resource center will only be the starting point for such
research, however. Students wanting to delve deeply into their past
will still have to go to the National Archives in Washington, talk
to relatives, check state and county records of births, retirement
records, marriage certificates and property deeds, just as any
genealogist would. Eventually, Matthews hopes, the center will
sponsor trips to archives in Washington and elsewhere.
   Genealogy is especially formidable for blacks. Census data are
only helpful back to 1870. It's almost impossible for most blacks to
discover their ancestral ``Kunta Kinte,'' the character in ``Roots''
captured in Africa and brought to America on a slave ship.
   What may be possible, though difficult, is to trace lineage
before 1870 by studying white slaveholding families.
   With black genealogy, said Matthews, ``you just can't get around
white folks. It's the only way.''

<HEAD>Maine Shelter Institute Teaches People How</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN O'QUINN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BATH, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joyce Cowfer was in tears when she called Pat
Hennin with the news that she'd miscalcuated the size of her
foundation and realized it would cost nearly $1,000 more to build
her Maryland home.
   Not to worry, said Hennin, co-owner of the Maine Shelter
Institute and Cowfer's former instructor. He consoled her, patiently
explained how to correct her blunder and even drew diagrams and
mailed them to her.
   Within a few months she was done: three bedrooms, two baths,
passive solar heat and a Jacuzzi, and all for $55,000 _ about
one-third market value.
   ``They not only give you the information, they give you the
confidence,'' Cowfer said. ``You don't need building experience.''
   For 15 years, Hennin, his wife Patsy and several other
instructors have taught students how to tackle the forbidding task
of building a home _ at less than half the cost of buying the
finished home or hiring someone to build it.
   People who build their own homes are more satisfied, Hennin said.
Less hurried than a contractor, the do-it-yourselfer will examine
every aspect of the building process and make carefully considered
decisions.
   ``Contractors don't shop around'' and generally do not match
solutions to specific problems, he said. The contractor ``simply
does it this way because that's the way they've always done it.''
   More than 14,000 students from around the world, including
novices who barely knew which end of the hammer to hold, have
attended the school located in a 120-year-old brick building in this
coastal town north of Portland. The students range in age from 18 to
70 and have included lumberjacks, doctors, Madison Avenue
executives, carpenters, engineers and architects.
   Students can choose the 15-week, one-day-a-week session for $450
per person or $725 per couple, or opt for compressed sessions of two
or three weeks for slightly more money. Classes are limited to 40
students.
   All students learn how to survey a lot, pour a foundation, design
and build every inch of a house. They also receive instruction in
the concept of heat, the physics of materials, engineering, framing
and financing.
   The information ``was presented in such a way that it was
non-intimidating,'' said Gary Miers, 34, who is spending $50,000 to
build a house valued at $140,000 in Raymond. ``It was presented in a
relaxed fashion.''
   Mistakes aren't ruinous, Hennin said, because ``there isn't
anything in a house that isn't forgiving.''
   That's comforting for students who also quickly learn that the
mistakes they make are much less costly than if a contractor were
building the house.
   ``When a contractor walks into a store, he doesn't ask what the
price is. He just assumes he's getting the wholesale cost,'' but the
price may be lower elsewhere, Hennin said. ``Contractors don't shop
around.''
   For example, a shelter institute student can make insulated glass
windows for about $3 per square foot, whereas a contractor is likely
to pay $10, Hennin said. All the lumber to build a house rarely
would be over $4,000, he added.
   The Hennins, both 45, began their business in 1974. Hennin, who
had just finished law school and had some prior building experience,
was hired to help build a house for a friend. Soon he had other
offers to build, and his wife's interest in home construction
surfaced.
   ``We had a choice of building houses for the rest of our lives or
getting involved in another way _ teaching people,'' Mrs. Hennin
said.
   Housing styles have changed over the last 15 years. After the
simple, box-style homes that marked the days of energy conservation
and the back-to-the-earth movement of the early and mid-1970s,
underground homes became popular. Those now have been replaced by
elaborate designs more reflective of the 1980s: prosperity,
sophistication and self-indulgence, Mrs. Hennin said.
   Jim and Roxie Westbrook of Santa Cruz, Calif., are building a
passive-solar country house on the outskirts of the nearby Henry
Cowell Redwoods State Park, complete with a hot tub and more gadgets
and fixtures than they had in the older homes they owned.
   ``There's nothing cheap in it,'' Mrs. Westbrook said in a
telephone interview. ``When it's a choice between quality and going
for quality, we go for quality.''
   Others prefer a home that is unadorned. Miers and his wife left
Pennsylvania with the romantic notion of building a home that
embraced their 1960s values _ the desire to be independent,
energy-efficient and frugal.
   But despite changing tastes, Mrs. Hennin says most people are
joined by a creative urge and a determination to take control of
their lives.
   ``It's a grabbing of life, rather than letting life roll you
over,'' she said. ``If houses cost so much, it's your responsibility
to figure out a way for them not to cost so much.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Iran's Islamic revolution will be 10 years old on
Feb. 11, the day Ayatollah Khomeini's followers seized power in
Tehran. The revolution enters its second decade with a limping
economy and after sobering setbacks. An AP correspondent who covered
the revolution reports on what may lie ahead.

   Iran's Islamic revolution has survived 10
turbulent years against all the odds _ bloody internal strife, a
crippling eight-year war with Iraq and the hostility of much of the
world.
   On Feb.11, 1979, nine days after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
nemisis of the Shah of Shahs, returned to Tehran in triumph from 15
years of exile, his bearded revolutionaries seized the reins of
government when the last monarchist government collapsed.
   Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had already gone into exile Jan. 16,
his 40-year reign on the Peacock Throne imploding in anarchy, his
imperial regime notorious for corruption and torture. Khomeini's
years in power have, by many accounts, been a mirror image.
   Nonethless, many of Iran's 50 million people will take to the
streets this week to mark the anniversary of the Islamic revolution
as the country stumbles, at last, out of a decade behind the dark
Islamic veil of self-imposed isolation.
   But beneath that mood of celebration, the country faces a future
of political uncertainty, exhaustion from the conflict with its
ancient Arab enemy, deep economic malaise and debate about which
path the revolution must now take.
   There are some indications of the direction the revolution is
moving under Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, the country's
leading pragmatist and, for the time being at least, the most
powerful figure after Khomeini.
   Acknowledging that revolutionary zealotry unnecessarily estranged
Iran from the rest of the world, he is the driving force behind
moves to the isolation that began with the November 1979 seizure of
the U.S. embassy and deepened with Tehran's support for anti-Western
Shiite terrorism and hostage-taking in Lebanon.
   He also acknowledged in October that the revolution, the war
notwithstanding, has also failed to improve conditions for the
``mostathafin,'' or the dispossessed, in whose name the revolution
was waged.
   ``We still have not been able to clarify for people economic
benefits as befits Islam, as we have differences of opinion among
ourselves over these issues,'' he said. ``We have not yet tackled
the day-to-day aspects of Islamic rule.''
   Above all, Iranians are increasingly obsessed with how much
longer Khomeini will live and what will happen when he dies.
   The stern-faced Shiite Moslem spiritual leader, father of the
revolution and its undisputed authority, is 88 years old and
reported in poor health, rarely venturing from his heavily guarded
residence in the Jamaran suburb of north Tehran, where the shah's
elite once lived.
   When he dies, Iran faces a power struggle between its leaders
that some Iranians fear could even start a civil war.
   Most political analysts believe that the revolution will survive
that expected turmoil, but that its ideological makeup will likely
undergo considerable change, depending on which faction comes out on
top.
   For the time being, Rafsanjani and his allies, who include
President Ali Khamenei, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and
Khomeini's son, Ahmed, who controls access to his ailing father in
his north Tehran stronghold, appear to have the upper hand.
   But they face stiff challenges in the days ahead from hardliners
such as Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, Prime Minister
Hussein Musavi and others who fear his policies are eroding the
revolution's Islamic purity.
   ``The revolution has endured and it's there to stay,'' said
Hans-Heino Kopietz, a seasoned analyst of Iranian affairs with the
London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.
   ``But revolutions do not remain rigid for very long because there
are too many internal pressures,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   ``A civil war after Khomeini dies is a possibility. The power
center in Tehran will probably be strong enough to prevent Iran's
polarizing, but the revolution will have to redefine itself if it is
to survive.''
   Philip Robbins, an analyst with London's Royal Institute for
International Affairs, said, ``Outsiders have focused largely on the
negative aspects of the last 10 years in Iran _ its failure in the
war and in the economy, two of its flagship policies. But the
revolution has done more than just get rid of the shah. Iran is now
very much its own boss. It has asserted its independence very
forcefully.
   ``Whether or not you like the regime, its self-confidence and
survival have to be recognized.''
   The war with Iraq, in which by some Western estimates 1 million
Iranians were killed and tens of thousands maimed, was a unifying
force that muted the bickering in the hierarchy and maintained
revolutionary momentum.

   The end of the war last August, when Khomeini reluctantly
accepted a United Nations-sponsored cease-fire after a chain of
battlefield defeats, removed that veneer, exposing and intensifying
the bitter infighting between rivals for power in the post-Khomeini
era.
   Iran's 83-member Council of Experts, formed in 1983 to designate
a successor to Khomeini, selected Grand Ayatollah Hussein-Ali
Montazeri two years later.
   Khomeini apparently went along with that choice, but many Iranian
leaders opposed it. Khomeini last year made out a new political
testament, to be opened after his death, in which he reportedly
indicated that he now prefers that a triumvirate of senior figures
run Iran after his demise.
   Since the cease-fire, there have been persistent reports that
hundreds, possibly thousands, of dissidents have been executed,
including supporters of Montazeri, in an apparent effort to
eliminate opposition in the aftermath of Iran's sudden collapse in
the war.
   Khomeini's grudging acceptance of a cease-fire, at Rafsanjani's
urging, embittered many hardliners even if it came as a relief to
many other Iranians.
   Rafsanjani, who is also acting commander-in-chief and Montazeri's
main rival, is considered to be behind the current crackdown.
   It is thought to be the most severe since the regime
systematically wiped out its leftist and liberal allies in 1981 when
tens of thousands of people were believed to have been killed.
   Yet it has come hand-in-hand with a general move to liberalize
Iran's repressive political structure. Several Iranian leaders have
called for greater freedom of expression and a greater role for the
long-suppressed private sector in the economy.
   The government has passed a law allowing the formation of
political parties, provided they don't conspire against the regime.
   Even hardline radicals such as Mohtashemi, an increasingly
powerful figure, and Intelligence Minister Mohammad Rey-Shahri, have
joined this chorus.
   Many see this sudden outbreak of tolerance, particularly among
the radicals, to be little more than an effort by the various
factions to consolidate their power bases for the battle for the
succession they all see coming.
   ``There is no external threat to the regime, despite the noises
made by opposition groups in exile, but after the war, it's not
surprising that the regime would direct people's thought toward an
internal threat,'' Robbins noted.
   Despite bitter opposition, Rafsanjani's policy of building
bridges to the West and Iran's suspicious Arab neighbors in the gulf
is seen as a triumph of pragmatism over revolutionary fanaticism.
   Rafsanjani stressed in a keynote statement recently that
revolutionary fervor had led Iran to make ``many mistakes'' in the
early days of the revolution.
   ``We have learned not to create unnecessary obstructions,'' he
said. ``We should not embark on making enemies for ourselves.''
   In a speech soon after, Rafsanjani echoed other leaders by
calling on some of the hundreds of thousands of educated Iranians
who are among the 2 million who have fled since 1979 to return home
to help in postwar reconstruction.
   ``If we improve conditions, if we give up some of the
short-sightedness, some of the excesses and some of the crude
aspects which were the requirements of the early stages of the
revolution, and that we have no need of nowadays, we will be able to
attract them back to the country,'' he said.
   Montazeri, who has long advocated greater freedom of expression,
possibly so his voice could be heard in media largely controlled by
Rafsanjani, noted in a speech to Islamic students: ``If we do not
tolerate listening to views opposed to ours, those opposition
remarks will soon be turned into bullets.''
   For most Iranian leaders, this is a remarkable turnaround from
the inflammatory exhortations to the world's 800 million Moslems to
rise up in the name of a resurgent Islam, as well as Tehran's
long-maintained drive to export its revolution.
   ``They've had to compromise their Islamic revolutionary
principles to get international economic help to rebuild the
country,'' Robbins said. ``It's a sign of political maturity.''
   Postwar Iran's first major political test will come in August,
when the fourth presidential election will be held. Khamenei, who
has served two terms, cannot run for a third under the constitution.
   Rafsanjani, whose political cunning has earned him the nickname
of ``the shark,'' is understood to be pressing for constitutional
reforms to give the presidency greater executive power and install
one of his allies.
   The presidency is just one of several competing power centers in
Tehran, a situation that has complicated the contradictory trends
within the hierarchy.
   Analysts agree that until the power struggle is settled and a
coherent leadership emerges, Iran faces further convulsions.

   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Here are some facts and figures on Iran:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE LAND:@ Iran, strategically located between the Soviet Union</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   and the oil-rich Persian Gulf, covers 988,800 square miles. It is
ringed by mountains, with the center largely desert covering an area
the size of France. The Zagros range, including the 18,386-foot
Mount Nahavand, runs from the Soviet border in the northwest to the
gulf.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE PEOPLE:@ Most of Iran's 50 million people adhere to Islam's</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Shiite sect. But there are Kurdish, Georgian, Turkoman and
Circassians, mostly in the north, with Afghan, Arab and Hindu
minorities in the Southeast. There are also dwindling groups of
Bahais and Jews. Two million Iranians were displaced by the war with
Iraq. Another 2 million have fled abroad since the 1979 revolution.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE ECONOMY:@ Iran was the Middle East's second largest oil</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   producer after Saudi Arabia before the 1979 Islamic revolution. It
has estimated reserves of 100 billion barrels. The conflict with
Iraq drove revenues down from a prewar $18 billion a year in 1979 as
low as $6 billion in recent years.
   Iran also has the world's second-biggest natural gas deposits
with 13.86 trillion cubic meters of proven reserves, and is rich in
iron, lead, zinc, copper, chromium, magnesium, sulphur and salt. It
is also famous for Persian carpets.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE HISTORY:@ Iran, once known as Persia, was the center of an</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   empire under King Cyrus in the 6th Century B.C. Alexander the Great
defeated the Persians in 331 B.C. Arab Moslems later ruled for three
centuries until defeated by the Mongols in 1258. The Safavids and
Qajars ruled in turn until 1925, when they were overthrown by Reza
Khan. His son, the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, ascended the
throne in 1941 and was toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution. That
dramatically altered the geopolitical map of the oil-rich gulf
region. Iraq invaded Iran on Sept.22, 1980. After initial defeats,
the Iranians pushed the Iraqis out. They later seized chunks of
Iraq, but lost them in a string of 1988 defeats and were forced to
accept a United Nations cease-fire that ended one of the century's
longest conflicts.

   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Here are some quotations illustrating the
10 years of the Iranian revolution:
   
   ``Don't give him (the Shah) a chance. Squeeze his neck until he's
strangled.'' Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Nov. 5, 1978, speaking
to Iranians from Paris after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi announced a
military government.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``We personally prefer that the Shah maintain a major role in the
government, but that is a decision for the Iranian people to make.''
U.S. President Jimmy Carter on Dec. 7, 1978, ``dumping'' the Shah,
who left Iran 39 days later.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Army surrenders. Khomeini wins. Destroying classified.'' USAF
Col. Tom Schaefer, defense attache in Tehran, on Feb. 11, 1979,
after the army declared its neutrality and the revolutionaries
seized power.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The (U.S. Embassy) hostages are like a fruit from which all the
juice has been squeezed out. Let us let them all go.'' Behzad
Nabavi, chief Iranian negotiator on the hostage issue, three days
before their release on Jan. 20, 1981.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The day I feel danger to the Islamic Republic, I will cut
everyone's hand off.'' Khomeini, on June 9, 1981, during a crackdown
on leftist opposition in which thousands were executed.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``I was like a child watching my father slowly turn into an
alcoholic. The drug this time was power.'' Former President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr about his erstwhile mentor, Khomeini, after
being forced to flee Iran in 1981.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``When Khomeini seems most crazy to us he appears most exemplary
to the Iranian people. That suggests you would have to say all Iran
is crazy,'' Princeton Professor Richard Falk.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The combatants must continue their fight by depending on their
faith in God and their weapons...The fate of the war will be decided
at the front, not through negotiations. Victory will be ours.''
Khomeini on May 28, 1988, two months before Tehran was forced to
accept a cease-fire.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Acceptance of this (cease-fire) is more deadly to me than
drinking poison. But I am glad to submit to God's will and drink
this cup for His satisfaction.'' Khomeini after Iran accepted a
cease-fire on Aug. 18, 1988.

   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Iran's leaders are the linchpins around
which various factions ebb and flow, often changing alliances on
various issues. Many have been killed in Iran's internal convulsions
since the 1979 revolution.
   Here are thumbnail sketches of the some of the key figures of the
Islamic republic's first decade:
   
   AYATOLLAH RUHOLLAH KHOMEINI, 88, aging and reportedly ailing
father of the revolution. He has conducted a balancing act between
the rival factions, seeking a unity that continues to elude Iran's
leadership. But he remains the indisputed authority, issuing decrees
on everything from the morality of chess and musical instruments to
the degree of governmental powers on Islamic issues.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ALI AKBAR HASHEMI RAFSANJANI, 52, a middle-ranking cleric,
parliament-seeker and acting commander of the armed forces, which
gives him power rivaled only by Khomeini. Dubbed ``the shark'' for
his political skills, he is the leading pragmatist and architect of
Tehran's moves to end its isolation. He was a key figure in
persuading Khomeini to end the war against Iraq.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ALI KHAMENEI, 48, Iran's conservative two-term president who
heads the Supreme Defense Council. He was wounded in an
assassination attempt several years ago. His political powers
diminished with the abolition of the ruling Islamic Republic Party
in 1986. But, barred by the constitution from running for a third
term, he has allied himself with Rafsanjani.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   AYATOLLAH HUSSEIN-ALI MONTAZERI, 64, Khomeini's designated
successor. Staunchly anti-United States, but an advocate of freedom
of expression, his power has been eroded by systematic elimination
of key supporters in a power struggle with Rafsanjani. Many Iranian
leaders oppose him, leading to speculation he will be little more
than a figurehead in the post-Khomeini era.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HUSSEIN MUSAVI, 47, prime minister since 1981. An anti-Western
radical who advocates tight state control of the economy, he is
opposed by Rafsanjani and the pragmatists. He has been criticized
for his policies during the gulf war and may soon be edged out of
power.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ABOLHASSAN BANI-SADR, 50, a Western-educated intellectual and one
of Khomeini's top aides in exile, he was the Islamic Republic's
first president. But he fled to France in 1981 in purges of the
revolution's liberal and leftist allies.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MOHAMMAD BEHESHTI, a former religious student of Khomeini's and a
key figure in the revolutionary elite. He was secretary-general of
the ruling Islamic Republic Party and former prosecutor-general
until his assassination in a leftist bombing with four cabinet
ministers in Tehran on June 28, 1981. Other prominent
revolutionaries were also later killed, triggering a purge of the
regime's opponents.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The infection proved curable, at a hefty cost. No
sensitive secrets were penetrated. But the anguish a now-famous
computer virus produced last November has led to soul-searching
about computer security. The fact is that the machines are
vulnerable to all sorts of interference, from playful hackers to
sophisticated criminals. Second of three articles.

   The bad news is that computers get
diseases.
   The worse news is that when they do, the illness can spread at
the speed of light, leaving everything from household accounts to
business data to power plants to defense systems fatally stricken.
   Apocalypse now? It's not just a movie.
   ``There's a potential risk that matches the destructiveness of a
nuclear attack,'' warns Donn Parker, an authority on computer crime
at SRI International here.
   In only a few short years, computers have become the bedrock of
how the United States and, increasingly, the developed world
operate. Computers handle half a trillion dollars in U.S. bank
transfers a day. They guide planes through the air and back to land.
They monitor hospital patients, predict weather, run phone systems,
plant crops and check the results out of supermarkets, store any
data imaginable. Your bank balance. The national debt. When a
computer gets sniffles, a whole system can catch pneumonia.
   Computer technology advances almost daily. So do the techniques
of computer security. So do the threats of someone, witting or
unwitting, monkey-wrenching whole systems.
   Computers get sick for the same reasons humans catch flu or VD.
They interconnect. The illnesses bear the same familiar names that
attack people: worms, bugs, viruses. They work the same way,
invading a system and replicating or infiltrating until the body is
overwhelmed.
   A worm broadly believed to have been planted last November by
Cornell grad student Robert Morris within hours fouled up some 6,000
interconnected computers in a defense-university network. Estimates
of the damage done and the man-hours spent to repair it run from $20
to $95 million.
   The origins of computer disease vary. Begin with the hacker, the
computer junkie who spends every waking minute bopping around in
computerland exploring its fascinations. Then come the mischievous,
then the malicious and then the outright criminal: the embezzler,
the corporate spy. What Donn Parker fears is the arrival,
eventually, of the terrorist.
   Some case histories of computer illness, benign and less so:
   In 1986 then Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir was about to
give a speech which said:
   ``Let us say yes to a great, massive, successful and victorious
Herut movement.''
   Just before delivery it was discovered an otherwise-minded
employee had wormed his way into Shamir's computer and changed the
text to read:
   ``Let us say yes to a tiny, worrying and incompetent Herut
movement.''
   In Fort Worth, Texas, an uneasy employee planted a ``time bomb''
in his company computer. Any time his name did not appear,
indicating he'd been fired, the hidden instruction would activate,
destroying the firm's files.
   About five years ago in New York, students at the exclusive
Dalton School found their way into the computers at the
Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research. They were discovered
before they could do any damage, intended or inadvertent, to medical
files.
   In Hayward, Calif., a rapist used a computer to get the addresses
of women he attacked by tracing their license plates through state
files to which he had access. In the Equity Funding scandal of the
'70s, a ring used computers to steal some $70 million.
   Besides the federal government, 48 states have laws against
computer crime. The remaining two, Vermont and West Virginia, are
considering introducing legislation this year.
   ``In effect, the laws say thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not do
damage and thou shalt not trespass,'' said Jay BloomBecker, who runs
the National Institute for Computer Crime Data in Los Angeles. He
estimates computer crime may have reached the billions-a-year level
in the United States. ``The problem is getting society to treat
computer crime as it does other crimes.''
   Computers are a natural for disease and crime because they are
vulnerable. They are vulnerable because their usefulness is
magnified many times over when they talk to each other to exchange
news or data or memory. Unfortunately, that means they can share
infection.
   ``A network is for exchange of information,'' says Richard
Koenig, associate director of the Computer Security Institute in
Northborough, Mass. ``If it needs a lot of security, you defeat its
purpose.''
   ``Any communication designed for easy access is subject to
tampering,'' says Bill Cunningham, head of management information
systems for The Associated Press.
   To stop tampering or worse, Koenig foresees the day when access
to computer networks will be encoded like a scrambler phone. But
that only makes computers even more intimidating to the unpracticed
layman than they already are. It's a dilemma.
   To the hacker, it's more likely a challenge. ``The more complex a
system gets, the more nooks and crannies for hackers to try and get
into,'' says Tom Mandel, a computer futurist at SRI. This is not to
point a finger at hackers. Quite the contrary. Their contribution to
technology is inestimable. They push machines beyond their designed
limits to new horizons. Their genius with software is one reason the
United States leads the world in that technology.

   Hackers resent guilt by association with computer viruses. They
call people who spread them or commit evil computer deeds
``crackers.'' They think crackers deserve jail as an example.
   Most computer crimes are done not by hackers but by company
insiders, according to BloomBecker's last survey in 1986. ``And they
were far less sophisticated than hackers,'' he notes.
   Nonetheless, there may be as many as 8 million personal computers
in the United States. Worldwide sales of PCs in 1986 were $50.9
billion. So a lot of people have new toys.
   ``Technology draws people to play with it,'' says Don Ingraham,
an assistant prosecutor in Alameda County, Calif., who specializes
in computer crime. And a lot of kid hackers ``gum up the works''
because they don't know any better, Mandel says.
   Morris, a hacker whose father was at Bell Labs and is now a
computer security expert with the National Security Agency, may have
had only an elegant prank in mind. But he made a mistake with his
worm, and it ate up disks.
   Hackers who sign off on computer bulletin boards as Crimson
Death, Phantom Phreaker, Nightstalker add a darker dimension. Dave
Flory, who heads the fraud unit for the San Jose police, cites
studies and experience that indicate that 2 percent of the
population are sociopathic and 1 percent of them criminally so. They
tend to be brighter than average and younger males, as are those
intrigued by computers. Flory leaves the inference standing.
   But when does hacking become cracking?
   A hacker has been breaking into Flory's police bulletin board and
says he won't leave unless the cops pay his phone bills to play
long-distance computer games.
   ``That's extortion,'' says Flory. San Jose cops caught two
teen-agers in a phone booth trying to hook up a laptop to a phone.
   ``They were in it for the sexual thrill of knowing secrets,''
says Flory. But it's also attempted theft from the phone company.
``They'll probably get three months at the most.''
   ``Generally, the punishment does not fit the crime,'' Donn Parker
believes.
   There are a great many gray areas. When a 15-year-old Cupertino
boy got into the Stanford University computer to change grades
Stanford stored for high schools as a community service, what's
that? A prank? Illegal entry?
   What is it when somebody has invaded your computer so that a nude
woman begins appearing as you're doing your income tax, leaving you
with the message: ``You should be doing something better than
looking at this trash''? Or the Cookie Monster that stopped your
computer until you wrote out ``C-O-O-K-I-E'' to its request ``I want
a cookie?'' Are these viruses jokes? Invasions of privacy?
   ``Hackers know where the line is,'' says Jef Poskanzer, a
30-year-old Berkeley hacker and software programmer.
   ``Maybe,'' says Flory, ``but a guy who wouldn't come at you with
a knife may harm you with a computer because it's impersonal. He
won't see blood.''
   ``Someone could pirate your technology, and it's not valuable to
you for eight years until the research pays off. How do you quantify
the loss?'' asks Koenig. ``What is the value of intellectual
property? We're still struggling with this.''
   If a hacker in Ithaca, N.Y., does damage to computer data in
California, has he violated California criminal laws against
unauthorized access? ``It's like a guy upstream dumping pollutants
in a creek,'' says Ingraham. ``The guy downstream who waters his
stock in the creek has a case. But our national laws are
inadequate.''
   Computer technology moves so fast the laws lag behind. It's like
the early days of the Old West. Cattlemen moved in and grazed their
herds on open range just as hackers used to browse unhindered in
computerland. Then the sheepmen arrived and put up fences. Range
wars resulted until the law could set guidelines.
   ``We don't teach breaking and entering in architectural school.
Don't teach aspects of cracking in grade school,'' says Ingraham.
``It's the same thing.''
   Parker believes schoolchildren should be taught computer ethics
just as they are taught computer use.
   ``We teach driver education because there is an obligation to
tell kids what the law is before we send them out on the road.''
   For the criminal, to whom ethics are immaterial, the computer has
been a bonanza. ``Today you can commit a crime in Berkeley from Oslo
if you wanted,'' Ingraham says. Jesse and Frank James had to have
horses and Colt .45s and a bag for the swag to rob a bank. Today you
don't even have to be present at the bank. The loot's on tape.
   The technology has exploded to the point, Parker says, where the
thief is confronted with a new problem: how much to take. ``The
smart criminal steals below the pain threshold of the victim. To
avoid embarrassment, the company may just say take your money and
go. But the thief still has to take enough to get to Rio or hire a
good lawyer if he doesn't make it.''
   Computers save prostitutes the cost of a pimp. They book
customers via bulletin boards. Ingraham rarely sees a drug bust
where the dealers don't keep track of business on computers.
   The only secure computer is one still in the box it came in or
one that never talks to another. Any further security is manmade
and, therefore, fallible.

   There was a popular game in Europe called ``Leisure Larry in the
Land of the Lounge Lizard'' that had a virus in it. The virus began
showing up in banks because employees were turning onto Larry on the
Q.T. Suppose Larry's virus had said, which it didn't: ``Eat all
records?''
   Employees at an American nuclear power plant were caught playing
a game disk in idle time. Suppose hidden in the game was a worm that
said, in effect: ``Drink juice?''
   Two brothers in Lahore, Pakistan, in 1985 intentionally planted a
virus in software they sold as a lesson to people who pirated disks.
The virus made its way to the United States where it destroyed,
among others, six months worth of notes stored by a reporter in
Providence, R.I.
   The first defense against criminals or computer germs is the
password. ``I can guess about a quarter of them,'' Poskanzer
estimates.
   ``Too many people are lazy,'' Flory has decided. ``They pick
their middle name or their street or their alma mater or a pet.''
   ``Just call up somebody's secretary and innocently ask the names
of the person's children,'' says Koenig.
   With their built-in speed, computers can fire off a limitless
array of possible password combinations. One new wrinkle delays
accepting a second password for l5 seconds after an improper one is
rejected.
   ``This probably deters anybody who is just fishing,'' Koenig
says. ``It takes them more time than it's worth.''
   Computers can also be secured by scanners for fingerprints, voice
or even eyeballs, no two being alike. But these cost money.
   ``You can install a $35,000 identification device but, if a
company has l00 terminals, say, can the expense be justified?'' asks
Koenig.
   A New York bank requires senior officers to sign off on money
transfers. The Pentagon says its vital computer nets are secure. But
so did armored knights until the crossbow came along and crossbowmen
until the musket was invented and riflemen until the tank appeared.
Offense vs. defense, yin and yang, technology marches on.
   ``At some point maybe we will be able to say that 99{ percent of
computers will be vaccinated against viruses,'' says Koenig. ``Then
somebody will invent something to get around it. Security is a
growth industry.''
   Yellow pages are flowering with new companies that will vaccinate
your systems or sanitize them after contamination.
   Security is proportional to the desire of the unauthorized to
peek through the keyhole of a computer system. There's all that
computer talk in space bouncing off satellites. The Soviet Union
intercepts America's, America intercepts the Soviet Union's.
Computers attack the codes. Search out any references to B-l bomber.
A cabinet report says so and so wasn't at a meeting Tuesday. Why?
What are the capitalists selling wheat for? Shell wants to know who
struck oil on the North Slope. Or hasn't.
   Somebody's classified computer talk is only idle chitchat if it
lacks the possibility of giving you a leg up. Or a hand in your
pocket.
   The stakes are high. For the individual: virtually his entire
fiscal profile is on computer tape somewhere. He signs off on a
bulletin board for three weeks. A burglar knows his house may be
empty.
   Parker calls them crimoids, waves of computer malfeasance that
come and go like hemlines as thieves, exporters and the like learn
new technology.
   ``Criminals are too lazy to hack, but hackers aren't, and word
gets around.''
   Crimoids to come: Porn by fax? Extortion by threat of personal
harm?
   The stakes at the national level: blackmail by virus? Sabotage?
   ``There's a potential for disaster,'' says Flory.
   About seven years ago, a New York bank made a 10 percent error in
reporting money in circulation, Parker recalls. ``A guy at the
Federal Reserve overlooked the mistake. For over three weeks the
amount of money in circulation was wrong. The paper loss in
securities was over $3 billion.
   ``Now suppose a foreign power gets into our computers that
determine our economic indicators so that they're wrong for a couple
of months. The Russians wouldn't do this, but some Third World
country that sent a computer scientist to MIT and who went back to
the pigs and chickens might. It could crash our economy. If the
breakdowns continued, we might lose faith. It could become a
question of national resiliency.''
   Parker, a tall, droll man who looks like everybody's favorite
uncle, was not smiling.
   It has already happened, somewhat. In 1979 the Red Brigades in
Italy said computers were the heart and mind of industrial society
and should be targeted for attack. Some 60 computer installations in
Europe have been raided since. The logic stored in the machines has
not. Yet.
   ``We can't go backward if we want to remain a competitive
society,'' said Dave Flory. ``But our system is vulnerable.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Forget the sleazy massage parlor. Professional
massage therapists are being invited into the workplace, often at
company expense, to help relieve stress and tension. In the past
five years, the number of certified massage therapists has increased
five-fold as more and more Americans learn how to get rubbed the
right way.

   After hours hunched over a steering wheel,
breathing bus fumes and fighting traffic, chauffeur Michael
Manganaro needs to be kneaded.
   For him, it's a company perk, the kind of service offered State
Department bureaucrats, professional hockey players, and a growing
number of other Americans.
   Manganaro and about 200 other employees of H.J. Heinz Co. can
kick off their shoes and sink into a padded chair for a 15-minute
rubdown once a week in a quiet conference room at the company's
downtown headquarters.
   ``Driving in the city really can tense you up,'' Manganaro, 41,
says as he gets out of the chair. ``This really relaxes you. It
really makes you feel good.''
   The rubdowns are offered as part of a new stress-reduction
program in which the company pays half of the $12.50 fee for 15
minutes. It's one example of how massage is going mainstream in the
United States.
   Thousands of Americans are getting rubbed the right way at work,
health clubs, hotels, malls, airports, street fairs and at home.
   ``Massage is no longer perceived as illicit or a toy for the idle
rich. It's for everybody,'' says Gene Arbetter, spokesman for the
American Massage Therapy Association. ``It's for the average worker.
It's for the weekend athlete, not just an Olympian.''
   The massage association estimates about 10 percent of Americans
have tried professional massage at least once. Those kneaded
regularly often work in high-pressure jobs that put kinks in their
shoulders and backs.
   ``The body has a good self-regulating mechanism, but we,
20th-century man, throw an awful lot of obstacles into that
balance,'' Arbetter says. ``Cradling the phone between the ear and
the shoulder, sitting in poor chairs, carrying a purse or gym bag on
only one shoulder, falling asleep in front of the television can do
things to the circulation and the muscle structure that are just not
kind.''
   Founded in 1943, the association's membership has jumped 500
percent to about 7,500 members in the past five years. Most states
don't license massage therapists, so the association has developed a
program of certification that requires members to spend at least six
months at an approved school, including 500 hours of classroom time,
Arbetter said.
   The cost of a massage varies from $20 to $80 per hour, depending
on the location and the therapist's training, he says.
   ``Massage doesn't cure or treat, but what it does try to do is
get some type of balance in the body by loosening tight muscles and
allowing tensions on the opposite sides of the body to be more
equal,'' Arbetter says.
   Sabina Vidunas gives the massages at Heinz. Like most of today's
practitioners, she has distanced herself from the image of the
sleazy massage parlor and refers to herself as a massage therapist,
not a masseuse. She studied massage for a year at the Swedish
Institute in New York City after working as a registered nurse for
five years.
   The Heinz employees remain clothed as Ms. Vidunas kneads the
upper body, including scalp and hands, in a sort of mini-massage
that uses no oil.
   ``Everyone is affected by a busier lifestyle,'' Ms. Vidunas says.
``It's just taking 15 minutes out of your day to totally relax.''
   Priscilla Grden, a secretary at the company's Heinz USA division,
has scheduled at least one massage a month with Ms. Vidunas since
April.
   ``It's just a great, great feeling,'' she says. ``It just takes
away all your tension.''
   Massage is making headway in other corporate quarters. Therapist
Jan Robbins says she ``takes it to the people'' with her company,
Corporate Stressbusters, a sort of massage delivery service in San
Francisco's financial district, ``a hotbed of stress.''
   When tense urban professionals beckon, Robbins shows up at their
office with the equipment: a stool, a cushion and a pair of hands.
   ``You just whip out the chair and people sit down, close the
phones, hit the lights, close the doors and get 15 minutes of peace
and quiet,'' Ms. Robbins says.
   Robbins says most of her clients work for small companies, but
some large corporations have shown interest in her service because
of the growing cost of stress-induced illness.
   ``People are suffering from everything from headaches to heart
disease and the traditional ways of dealing with these problems
aren't working,'' Ms. Robbins says. ``The claims for mental and
emotional stress are skyrocketing.''
   Even in the offices of the State Department in Washington, D.C.,
massage is a hit. Employees pay for the services of Bahaa Karra,
whose company, Washington Health Systems, comes to the office
basement twice a week to offer massages ranging from 15 minutes for
$11 to an hour for $44.
   ``I'm booked full for two or three weeks in advance,'' Karra
says. ``It is not easy to get an hour massage in the State
Department.''
   Nancy Gelman says she gives 15-minute massages in her portable
chair at Jeffrey's Hair Salon in Pittsburgh, often to clients
``between their manicure and their hair.''
   Carol Cadman, a massage therapist for 12 years in Petaluma,
Calif., teaches the technique to nurses at the University of
California at San Francisco.
   ``The nurses do the real hands-on nurturing and healing work with
people,'' says Cadman, who believes the medical field fails to
recognize the value of massage.
   The New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League have their
own massage therapist, who travels with the team.
   ``It facilitates injury rehabilitation, and some of the players
feel it's also preventative at times,'' says team spokesman Dave
Freed. ``It helps to keep them loose and limber.''
   Practitioners also are making their way into the malls. Bob Watt
opened Massage Works about three years ago in a plaza in Plantation,
Fla., near Fort Lauderdale.
   Watt says business is so good he hopes to hire two additional
therapists full time and expand his office to include the empty
store next door.
   ``We get all kinds of people, from 12 years old to 92,'' he says.
``Quite a majority of them are your average businessman down the
street, the printer, the salesman, the car dealer, whatever.''
   At the Phoenix and Dallas-Fort Worth airports, frazzled fliers
can drop into the Air Vita health club for a massage.
   ``It makes a layover a lot easier,'' says therapist Linda Wilson.
``It's a relief to come to a place and be able to relax for a little
bit.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Like many terminally ill patients, Fred Valenti
wanted to be at home with his wife and daughter when he died,
talking about the happy times in his life. Hospice care offers that
kind of alternative to intensive care in a hospital when there is no
hope for recovery. The last of three articles.

   Fred Valenti died sitting on his favorite
couch, a slight grin on his face, his terminally ill wife and his
only daughter at his side. He was in his underwear, the way he had
always dressed around the house.
   ``I think it's the way he wanted to go,'' said his daughter, Ann
Spiegel, a 46-year-old New York social worker. ``I don't have a
terrible feeling about it. I'd normally be freaked out to see
someone die, but it was like so natural. He did it his way.
   ``I kept staring at him. I'm afraid to go to funeral parlors to
see dead people. But this just didn't bother me. I just liked
looking at him because he looked so peaceful and happy.''
   Like many terminally ill patients, Fred Valenti felt more
comfortable at home with his wife of nearly 50 years, Mary, and
cared for by nurses and social workers from the Merrimack Valley
Hospice in neighboring Andover.
   Mary and Fred had lived in Lawrence most of their lives. As
children, both had emigrated from Italy with their parents who came
here to work in the textile mills.
   At age 14, Mary went from the eighth-grade to the mills for $12 a
week to help support her parents, both of whom by now had become
disabled. They were so poor that to save 3 cents, they bought
cracked eggs for 7 cents a dozen.
   Fred worked in a spinning room as a mule spinner. He met Mary in
a dance hall.
   Those remembrances came out while the two were recording an oral
history of their lives for John Moore, a hospice social worker, who
passed the tapes on to their daughter and granddaughter.
   For patients who are depressed, talking about their lives gives
them a chance to relive some of their successes and to feel they've
accomplished something.
   ``It also gives the person the opportunity to get their mind off
the pain,'' Moore says. ``You start talking about what it was like
courting and all of a sudden they're transformed from these elderly
sick people into someone who says, `Hey, this was a great life. I
enjoyed it.'''
   Fred and Mary were married on June 18, 1939. Two weeks before he
died, they were sitting on that favorite couch, talking with
visitors.
   At 5-feet-1, Fred was only 3 inches taller than Mary. His weight
had shrunk to 130 pounds. ``I have no fear,'' he said. ``We all
die.''
   Mary came to hospice first with a long-neglected breast tumor.
Fred was diagnosed last summer with bowel cancer that spread to his
liver. When Mary was in the hospital for 68 days last spring, Fred
visited her three times a day, making the trips by bus.
   ``I worry about my wife all the time,'' Fred said. ``She gets me
angry when she won't eat.''
   ``Eating is one of our major symptoms,'' says Patricia O'Neil, a
liaison nurse at the Merrimack Valley Hospice. ``Food is love. When
you cook for people and prepare food for people, that's showing your
love for them. With Italian people, food is a very important part of
their life.''
   Fred worried, too, about Mary's pain, frequently reminding her to
take her medication.
   ``She gets all the pills she wants. She gets it from these people
here,'' he said, nodding toward Mrs. O'Neil and John Moore, two of
the visitors. ``Sometimes they bring them late at night.''
   ``Pain is the problem that most people fear most of all,'' says
Mrs. O'Neil. ``And we get very assertive about taking care of
someone's pain whether it's through pills, liquids, high-tech,
morphine pumps or IV drips, if that is what is needed. And we do
this all at home.
   ``Hospitals are places where you go to be cured, to be saved. I
think a lot of physicians have a real hard time with that. Their
whole life has been spent in saving people and some of them just
can't deal with the fact that their patient is dying. They have a
real hard time letting go. Some of them have tests and procedures,
with kids especially, up until the time they die.''
   That was not the case with Laura Dahmen, a 63-year-old cancer
victim from Turtle Creek, Pa., who spent her last days playing cards
and cracking jokes, surrounded by friends and relatives and scores
of sympathy cards.
   She refused chemotherapy because ``it wasn't gonna do me any
good.'' The cancer in her liver had spread to her spleen and lungs.
She endured waves of pain in her abdomen so bad that just thinking
about it made her cry. She resisted morphine until near the end
because she thought it would alter her mind. Just the same, she
outlived the doctors' prognosis by 4{ months. ``I'm just gonna live
until I die,'' she said.
   She tried to be as self-dependent as she could with the help of
nurses and workers from the Forbes Hospice in Pittsburgh who became
her friends. ``They're so loving and so friendly,'' she said. ``It
makes it easier. I tell them anything, anything at all.''
   Leah George, a nurse, visited Laura regularly, checking her
condition and medicine.
   ``We're kind of the liaison between the physician and the family
and that's a real big thing because families become very frustrated
trying to communicate with physicians in offices, trading phone
calls, never understanding,'' she said.
   Her time with Laura was rewarding, she says. ``When I see that my
visit can really make a difference in the way someone feels,
particularly in home care. A lot of times just conversation with
people makes an amazing difference in the way they feel.''
   Laura died in her daughter's home last Oct. 17 after she became
so weak she couldn't walk and suffered a fall that sent her to the
hospital. She had wanted to remain in her small senior citizens
apartment surrounded by cards from well-wishers.
   One that always brought a big smile to her face was from a
7-year-old girl named Macha who scribbled, ``I hope you don't get
too sick or not sick at all.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Long before Mickey Mouse found Florida, an Old
West tradition flourished in the orange groves. Smack in the middle
of the state is cowboy country, where ranchers on horseback tend
their herds of Brahman cattle. And twice a year professional cowboys
from all across the country come to the outskirts of Walt Disney
World for a rodeo where the spills and thrills are for real.

   Listen up, pilgrims, this is no
make-believe stuff like they put on over yonder at the Magic Kingdom.
   This is down-and-dirty, bone-crunching, tobacco-spittin' rodeo,
the big leagues of the cowboy game, born in the U.S.A.
   As they have been doing for years, hundreds of volunteers are
cleaning bullpens, putting up fences and readying the horse chutes
for the 82nd Silver Spurs Rodeo, the largest in the Southeast.
   Make no mistake. The rodeo, scheduled for Feb. 23-26, is no
slapped-together, amateur affair that is a side attraction to a
county fair or a carnival.
   This is a fully sanctioned, professional rodeo that attracts the
top cowboy stars in the country for big-money prizes in traditional
events such as bull riding, calf roping, steer wrestling and saddle
bronc riding.
   It is the celebration of an original American sport born in the
Old West, where cowboys challenged each other in contests of
ranching skills.
   Set amid the glitzy entertainment complexes of Walt Disney World,
Sea World, Boardwalk and Baseball and Cypress Gardens, this is where
you get your Levis caked with mud, listen to the old-timers spin
tall tales and eat some of the best barbecued beef in the world.
   To the surprise of some, Florida holds many rodeos, although it's
certainly not a part of the Old West.
   ``If you wanted to, you could go to a rodeo just about every
weekend in this state,'' says Reed Berlinsky, a Kissimmee
advertising executive knowledgeable about rodeo history.
   But most are not full-fledged events sanctioned by the
Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association, the organization that
sponsors some 400 events a year throughout the country. The
Kissimmee rodeo is ranked among the top 50 in that group.
   Another large PRCA rodeo is held in Arcadia, which contests the
local claim that the Silver Spurs Rodeo is the state's oldest.
   One of the most unusual aspects of the Kissimmee rodeo is that it
is put on strictly by volunteer labor.
   Twice a year, in February and July, 300 to 400 members of the
private Silver Spurs Riding Club and many of their relatives and
friends come together to run the show. They oversee stock, check in
cowboys, clean pens, work in concessions, park cars, tabulate
scores, man ticket windows and put together programs, says publicist
Carolyn Reis.
   ``The rodeo is Americana, something real and dusty and dirty,''
Reis says. ``It is remarkable because it is thriving in the middle
of these sophisticated, top-name tourist attractions with
multimillion-dollar budgets and attendance.''
   The event draws about 30,000 people over four days, and many of
them are faithful rodeo fans who travel long distances to get here.
   They come to see the likes of Lewis Feild of Elk Ridge, Utah,
whose specialty is bronc riding. He was the reigning ``world
all-around champion cowboy'' for three years running when he
appeared here last year. Feild made $144,335 on the rodeo circuit in
1987, when he was ranked the top rodeo performer by the PRCA.
   Last year's all-around champ at the Silver Spurs Rodeo was Clay
O'Brien Cooper of Gilbert, Ariz. He and a partner have been world
champion team ropers for three years.
   Other rodeo athletes here last year included bareback rider Bruce
Ford of Kersey, Colo, who won $102,000 on the circuit in 1987, and
Lane Frost of Lane, Okla., a bull rider who won $105,000.
   The top rodeo stars can pick up $15,000 or more in one rodeo and
usually ride in more than 100 a year, Berlinsky says.
   Some of Osceola County's old-time ranch families founded the
Silver Spurs Rodeo in 1944, developing it from a club that gave
horseback quadrille (dance) demonstrations for many years.
   ``Club members cut their own fences, borrowed some bleachers from
some guy in Tampa, and they became the first contestants in a
pasture on Geech Partin's land,'' Berlinsky says.
   Geech Partin is a legend in these parts for several reasons. He
also sold some of his land to developers who later turned out to be
the Walt Disney Co.
   Members of the Partin, Bronson, Overstreet, Rohde and Chapman
families are active to this day in the club and rodeo.
   ``We're going into the third generation of club members who
support and work at this rodeo,'' Berlinsky says. ``We are into the
second generation of `big bosses.'''
   The big boss, or club president and rodeo director, this year is
Tom Booth, the assistant principal of Osceola High School who is
also a part-time rancher.
   Incidentally, during the football season, the Silver Spurs arena
becomes the high school football stadium, where Big Boss Booth used
to be a coach.
   The profits from the rodeo _ after all the big purses and
expenses are accounted for _ go to charity.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Their vast reservation in Montana is rich in coal
and other minerals, but the unemployment rate among Crow Indians is
75 percent. At the same time, exploitation of these resources could
threaten some sacred Indian religious sites. That's why tribal
leaders have asked an urban planner at Southwest Missouri State
University to draw up a land-use plan and zoning ordinance for the
entire reservation.

   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ The once-nomadic Crow Indians, who roamed the
plains hunting buffalo, are turning to professional city planners to
help them protect their vast reservation from haphazard development.
   That means zoning.
   The 1.8-million acre Crow reservation in south-central Montana,
which encompasses the spot on the Little Big Horn River where Gen.
George Custer made his last stand, is home to 6,000 people and
second in area only to the 16-million acre Navajo reservation in
northeastern Arizona.
   It's also rich in coal and other minerals, the exploitation of
which could threaten some sacred religious sites.
   So leaders of the Crow tribal council asked Burl Self, an urban
and regional planner and professor of geosciences at Southwest
Missouri State University here, to draw up a comprehensive land-use
plan, zoning map and zoning ordinance for the reservation. Self will
present the plan to the council in late February or early March.
   ``The ability to control the development of land is central to a
unit of government,'' says Self, an Oklahoma native and a member of
the Choctaw tribe.
   Richard Real Bird, chairman of the tribal council, hopes zoning
will be of economic benefit, but the main motivation is a means of
controlling development.
   ``We have not done that in the past, and people have set up
businesses, outhouses _ anything, anywhere they feel like,'' Real
Bird says.
   ``The idea is not really new, but...we don't know of any other
tribe that has done it.''
   Carl Shaw, spokesman for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, says most
reservations are not zoned, though some tribes have set aside plots
as industrial or housing areas and others are considering zoning.
   ``Tribes are becoming more sophisticated in their efforts to have
a little more control over their own land,'' Shaw says.
   ``I think the Crow are now saying, `We do have the right to
sovereignty,''' Real Bird says. ``That was given to us by God, not
by the United States government. And what we have left of the
sovereignty, we're going to begin to exercise to provide a better
life for the Crow people.''
   Self says treaties between the U.S. government and American
Indians gave the tribes a large share of authority on their
reservations but tribes have been slow to exercise their power.
   Reservations are separate from state governments. Elected tribal
councils, headed by chairmen, oversee independent agencies such as
police forces, courts and the Crow's Little Big Horn College.
   Self says tribes were corralled on land considered worthless in
the 19th century, but ``these areas have since proven to be great in
mineral resources.''
   The Crow are the sixth largest owners of coal in the world, Self
says, adding that American Indians own 20 percent of the country's
natural resources.
   ``They're more significant than OPEC to the economy of the United
States,'' he says.
   Yet, unemployment among the Crow is 75 percent and 95 percent of
the tribe members receive aid from entitlement programs.
   Self says zoning will have economic impact. As an example, he
says, some Crow enterprises have been stripped of access to
customers because the state government, rather than the Crow, has
dictated the location of new highways and improvements to existing
roads. A zoning ordinance would give tribal officials the authority
to coordinate road-building with development.
   Zoning also would play a part in determining property values if
the Crow impose taxes.
   Real Bird says zoning is a first step to economic
self-sufficiency. The tribe also has plans to build a hydroelectric
plant and sell power. And the Crow are considering imposing a
severance tax on coal mining, an enterprise controlled by
non-Indians.
   ``All these social problems that are associated with poverty,
people are beginning to understand that we have to get ourselves out
of these problems,'' Real Bird says.
   Self says his zoning plan would exclude what might be considered
quick economic fixes. He suggests outlawing hazardous waste dumping
and heavy industry except for coal mining. He also would severely
restrict development on sacred land, where he said some of the
highest concentrations of mineral resources are located.
   ``They'll accept economic development, but they want more of a
say in what kind of development, just like cities do,'' Self says.
   ``There are a lot of sacred or religious sites on the reservation
that previously were not protected,'' Real Bird says. ``I think it's
important that these sites and areas be protected for the future of
the tribe.''
   Real Bird acknowledges that exercising more authority could
significantly alter the reservation landscape and affect the Crow
relationship with non-Indians who operate businesses and own land on
the reservation.
   But Real Bird and Self say they have encountered little
resistance so far, certainly nothing like the legal storm that
followed a similar attempt at zoning by the Yakima tribe of
Washington state. That case is before the U.S. Supreme Court.
   D. Louie Clayborn, Montana's coordinator of Indian Affairs, says
there may be some grumbling by local government and private
businesses, but he believes tribal sovereignty has been established
by the courts.
   ``When you talk about zoning, it's the right of a government to
act as a government,'' Clayborn says. Montana Gov. Ted Schwinden
``has no problems with tribal governments acting as governments.''

   Diane Lane was apprehensive about the
reception awaiting her in Texas when she arrived for her role as a
``sporting gal'' in the CBS miniseries ``Lonesome Dove.''
   One of her co-stars in the epic Western story is Tommy Lee Jones,
who was her husband and a tough gambler in her last movie, ``The Big
Town.''
   During the filming of that movie, she says, Jones ``was so deep
into his character that I was a little intimidated. When I finished
my part I left without saying goodbye. I was a little worried how he
would greet me when I got to the `Lonesome Dove' set. Well, he swung
me around and said, `How are you, darling?' I'd never seen him so
jovial. People looked and I said, `He's my ex-husband, you know.'''
   In the miniseries, Lane stars as Lorena Wood, the town prostitute
at the Dry Bean Saloon in Lonesome Dove, Texas. Most of her scenes
are with Robert Duvall.
   The four-part miniseries, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning
novel by Larry McMurtry, kicks off the February sweeps for CBS on
Sunday and is continued on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Jones and Duvall both play former Texas Rangers who run a small
ranch called the Hat Creek Outfit. They are almost opposite in their
personalities. Jones is Woodrow F. Call, who is sullen and taciturn,
while Duvall is Augustus McCrae, who is charming and philosophical.
   The story centers on an arduous cattle drive to Montana, which
becomes a metaphor for life itself, with all of its adventures and
triumphs and failures and its diverse and clashing personalities.
   Lorena persuades another former Ranger to take her along after
the trail drive. She is kidnapped by a renegade Indian, raped and
sold to a band of traders. She's rescued by Gus.
   Bill Wittliff wrote the screenplay, based on McMurtry's novel,
and Simon Wincer directed. It also stars Danny Glover, Robert Urich,
Frederic Forrest, D.B. Sweeney, Ricky Schroder and Anjelica Huston.
   ``I was one of the last people cast,'' Lane says. ``I loved the
role and I loved her relationship with Duvall.''
   Lorena, she says, is ``a very introverted character and that can
be difficult to play on a TV schedule. I thought it would be a great
challenge.
   ``Lorena loves Gus but she's not in love with him. Sex has been
such a bitter experience for her. She loves him like a father
figure. But it's more than that. He loves her completely. He knows
her better than she knows herself. She's powerless to resist his
love. She could win a fight with a dragon, but there's no point in
fighting Gus.''
   Lane says she cannot imagine any other actor playing Gus. Duvall
has a way with dialogue she felt might sound licentious coming from
another actor.
   ``The first scene we filmed is the first one you see in the
miniseries,'' she says. ``It's a poker game that will decide whether
I'll get into the poke with him. He cheats, of course.
   ``Lorena is the true cliche whore with a heart of gold. She's not
a conniving person. She wishes she was because everyone else is. One
reason I wanted to play her is that I've played so many conniving
women. That's more of a cliche than the whore with the heart of
gold.''
   Much of the miniseries was filmed near Del Rio, a border city in
Texas, where the cast frequently crossed over the border for
authentic Mexican food. Crossing back was sometimes more difficult
after a few margaritas, she says.
   When she's not acting, Lane lives near Augusta, Ga., with her
husband, actor Christopher Lambert. They met when they did a tango
together on a TV show when she was promoting ``The Cotton Club'' and
he was promoting ``Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the
Apes.''
   Lane grew up in New York. Her father, Burt Lane, was a theater
workshop director, who gave her an early introduction to the stage.
Her mother was a singer and model. She made her film debut at the
age of 13 with Laurence Olivier in ``A Little Romance.''
   She also starred in ``The Outsiders,'' ``Rumblefish,'' ``The
Cotton Club,'' ``Cattle Annie and Little Britches,'' ``To Elvis With
Love,'' and ``Streets of Fire.''
   ``I started as a baby in an experimental, avant-garde play,'' she
says. ``It was like a tribal opera. It was a trilogy of Greek
tragedies. Once I got into acting my father was beyond instrumental
in keeping me in the business. I was doing plays and homework and
touring. It was too much for one person. He was there to carry me
through.
   ``I must say he didn't get a lot of appreciation until later.''

   In one 12-month period, Christine Baranski got
married, appeared in her first Broadway hit, won a Tony and had a
baby.
   What to do for an encore?
   Have another baby, take a sabbatical from the theater, come back
to do a challenging play like ``Hedda Gabler'' in regional theater
and then star on Broadway in ``Rumors,'' the latest Neil Simon
success.
   All that took more than a year, Miss Baranski admits, but then
it's not easy to juggle a marriage, a family and the theater.
   At one time, a big-time theater career seemed almost out of
reach. Seven years ago, the actress was preparing to go on stage at
a tiny off-off-Broadway theater, the kind of dismal, out-of-the-way
place with a well-worn ambiance, miniscule salaries and one dressing
room for a dozen actors.
   ``I was thinking to myself, `I can't believe I spent all those
years studying at Juilliard and now I'm sitting on a toilet in a
warehouse, waiting to make my entrance,''' she recalls. ``The
experience was difficult.''
   Difficult until she saw a New York Times review the next day,
praising her performance in the play, a one-act, two-character
comedy called ``The Undefeated Rumba Champ.''
   From then on, she knew she would make it in the theater. Critics
and audiences reinforced her opinion, later applauding her
performances in plays by William Shakespeare and Tom Stoppard. Her
honors include an Obie for ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''
off-Broadway and a Tony for Stoppard's ``The Real Thing'' on
Broadway.
   For the moment, Miss Baranski is holding forth in much more
comfortable surroundings, a dressing room just inside the stage door
of Broadway's Broadhurst Theater where ``Rumors'' has settled in for
a run. But the acting hasn't gotten any easier.
   Consider the plot of ``Rumors,'' which has been described by the
playwright as a farce. To make the play work, Miss Baranski has to
imagine: one, a good friend has shot himself; two, he's bleeding to
death, and three, news of the shooting must be hushed up at all
costs, even from the victim's good friends who begin arriving with
astonishing frequency.
   ``You have to make all of that real to yourself,'' she says
matter of factly. ``That's the essence of working in a comedy. You
believe it, and the audience laughs.''
   They laugh at her slow disintegration from stylish suburban
matron, done up in designer duds, to hysterical housewife, breaking
out in hives, swigging vodka and ready to kill for a cigarette.
   ``This is not a difficult role in that the intentions are very
straightforward,'' Miss Baranski says. ``What's happening to the
character is very clear. Other roles can be difficult because you
have trouble figuring out why the character is doing what she's
doing.''
   When the show started its pre-Broadway trek last September at San
Diego's Old Globe Theater, some of the cast members, Miss Baranski
included, couldn't get to sleep until 2 a.m. because of the play's
high energy.
   ``Ultimately with farce, what you are playing is events, and
you're playing the situation,'' she says. ``It's really not about
characters, and it's not about relationships. Most of the lines
communicate information about what's going on. They're funny because
Simon writes funny.''
   But it's not easy to act.
   ``With farce you really have to maintain the same performance
every night,'' the actress says. ``You can't change, because it will
affect what other people do on stage. You almost have to say the
same line readings and the same rhythms. When I rehearsed this role,
I didn't realize I'd have to do it every night.''
   Miss Baranski is one of those actresses who rarely was unemployed
in the theater after she graduated from drama school in 1974,
although she often had to leave New York to get a job.
   The show business bug bit early, back in Cheektowaga, N.Y, a
Buffalo suburb. Although her parents were not actors, her
grandparents had been performers in Buffalo's Polish theater.
   ``I think what did it for me was that my father once took me to
the ballet,'' she says. ``I got that feeling about performing very
young.''
   At 16, she was a member of the Buffalo Theater Workshop which, in
the heady revolutionary days of the late 1960s, joined forces with
the New York Theater Workshop to do street theater in places like
Bedford-Stuyvesant.
   Miss Baranski studied at the Juilliard School in New York for
four years. One of her instructors, Michael Kahn, got her a small
job at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Connecticut. ``It was a
lady in waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting,'' she laughs.
   Regional theater beckoned, and Miss Baranski went out to the
hinterlands.
   ``I think you learn by doing really great plays,'' she says. At a
point in her late 20s, she decided to stay in New York.
``Eventually, you have to let people know who you are.''
   Director Mike Nichols saw her in ``Crackers,'' a little-known
film by Louis Malle, and in the workshop production of ``Sunday in
the Park with George.'' He cast her as Jeremy Irons' wife in ``The
Real Thing'' which arrived on Broadway in early 1984.
   ``That put me on the map,'' she says. ``I think the only thing
that really gets you there is if you're in a hit.''
   She married actor Matthew Cowles right before going into ``The
Real Thing.'' Their first daughter, Isabel, was born in September
1984.
   The actress went into such long-running shows as ``Hurly Burly''
and ``The House of Blue Leaves.'' When she got pregnant again, Miss
Baranski took a year off to have her second daughter, Lily.
   Studio Arena, a regional theater in Buffalo, enticed her back to
the stage last spring in ``Hedda Gabler'' and from there she went
into ``Rumors.''
   ``All this would have been harder if I hadn't established my
career,'' Miss Baranski says. ``But I felt with `The Real Thing'
something was really satisfied, and I don't feel as compelled to
prove myself. I can take time off and feel OK about it. And now I'm
doing `Rumors.' I said to myself, `See, you can disappear for a year
and you can come back. You'll get work.'''

<TEXT>
   The prospect of living in a black-led,
independent Namibia already has driven some whites across the border
to South Africa, but most plan to stay, at least long enough to see
how things go.
   For car dealer Dick Hattingh, independence promises new business
prospects. For rugby coach Henning Snyman, it means a chance for his
team to play overseas. For the Rev. Cobus de Klerk, it offers his
fellow Afrikaners an opportunity to shed their label as ``the damned
apartheid people.''
   Elections are set for Nov. 1 to select an assembly to draw up a
constitution for Namibia. It also will set a date for actual
independence; the strong concensus is it will come before year's end.
   South Africa has said it will cede its authority in Namibia as
soon as the constituent assembly convenes. It agreed to Namibia's
independence after Cuba signed an accord providing for the
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola to the immediate north.
   Whites make up only about 75,000 of Namibia's 1.3 million people,
but during 74 years of South African rule they have played a
dominant role in politics and business in what was known as
South-West Africa.
   Even the South-West African People's Organization, which has
waged a guerrilla war for independence since 1966, is urging whites
to stay and contribute to building a new, sovereign country.
   ``These whites are Namibians,'' said Jerry Ekandjo, a spokesman
for SWAPO's legal political wing. ``We have not been fighting
against them.''
   Few whites support SWAPO, and most are expected to back more
conservative parties in the independence elections, which are to
take place under United Nations supervision. But the plans to stay
are being made with the assumption that SWAPO, at minimum, will win
a major role in the new government.
   ``My biggest enemy at the moment is not SWAPO,'' said Snyman,
head of a farmers' association and coach of the territory's top
rugby team. ``It's people who are negative about the coming
independence.''
   In recent weeks, more than 100 white transport workers and their
families have left for South Africa. The outward flow is expected to
swell if SWAPO takes power, with estimates ranging between 10 to 25
percent of the white population.
   ``Many people are praying that Resolution 435 (the U.N.
independence plan) will go down the drain,'' said de Klerk, leader
of the Dutch Reformed Church, to which most of Namibia's 47,000
Afrikaners belong.
   ``One fears a change. It's human nature that you prefer it the
way it is, especially when you're in a favorable position.''
   About 30,000 whites left Namibia amid independence rumors in the
late 1970s. De Klerk predicted a similar flight if independence
materializes this time, but estimated that at least three-quarters
of the Afrikaners, himself included, would stay and give black
majority rule a try.
   ``After all these years of fighting to save this country for
civilization, they feel they have to stay and work for the best,''
he said. ``People are sick and tired of war.''
   Hattingh, a Windhoek automobile dealer who is president of
Namibia's Chamber of Commerce, said white businessmen hope for a
surge of foreign investment after independence frees Namibia from
international sanctions imposed on South Africa. But he worries
about what might happen if SWAPO wins outright control of the
government and moves to nationalize ranches and mines, the main
revenue producers.
   He said SWAPO's announced intention to reduce economic ties with
South Africa could be devastating. The territory receives most of
its imports from South Africa, its only rail link to the outside
world is through South Africa, and its only deepwater port _ Walvis
Bay _ is a South African-owned enclave that South Africa refuses to
yield.
   Other neighboring black-run nations continue to trade with South
Africa because without trade and trade routes their economies would
be seriously damaged.
   If Namibia suffers a manpower shortage because white
professionals and technicians leave, ``it's our own mistake,''
Hattingh said.
   ``We suppressed them (blacks). We didn't give them a chance in
the past,'' he said.
   The largest white political faction, the National Party of
South-West Africa, opposes one-person, one-vote elections and is
clinging to its support of segregated schools and hospitals, even
though both are apt to be abolished by any new government. The party
is predominantly Afrikaner, and SWAPO plans to end Afrikaans' status
as an official language alongside English.
   ``We believe that if forced apartheid is wrong, then forced
integration is wrong,'' said Kosie Pretorius, the National Party
leader.
   ``Everyone who's leaving the country is making it more difficult
for those who stay,'' he said. ``I am adamant to stay. ... But if
things become unbearable, we'll have to look at it again.''
   According to Ekandjo, even a segregationist like Pretorius is
welcome to remain, ``as long as he obeys the law. He can think what
he wants.''
   To many Namibians, black and white, Zimbabwe offers an
encouraging example.
   Nine years after white-ruled Rhodesia became black-ruled
Zimbabwe, about 100,000 whites remain, compared with a peak white
population of 275,000. In South Africa, pro-government media often
depict Zimbabwean whites' life as unpleasant, but in Namibia the
image is different.
   ``In Zimbabwe, whites are still living very, very comfortably,''
Hattingh said. ``They don't want to leave. If they can do it, we can
do it, too.''
   Some Zimbabwean whites have stayed because of restrictions on
taking money abroad. In Namibia, Pretorius said, some whites have
shifted their funds to South Africa while remaining in the territory
to see how the elections turn out.
   Hattingh said many Namibian whites had no deep affection for
South Africa and felt its white leaders had used Namibia as a
testing ground for racial reforms they were reluctant to try at home.
   Moses Katjiuongua, a black member of the territorial Cabinet who
is expected to help lead a moderate alliance against SWAPO in the
elections, urged whites to ``stay here and fight to make this a
better country, a non-ethnic democratic country.''
   If this happened, he said, ``we could induce South Africans to
see that blacks and whites can live together. We can change South
Africa in a positive way.''
   De Klerk expressed concern that some blacks had unreasonable
expectations about life after independence.
   ``The disillusionment will be so harsh for them,'' he said.
``They're under the impression they will get a house, a car and a
checkbook after independence.''
   Most whites, he added, wonder: ``Do we have assurances that law
and order will be adequate, that our lifestyle will be safe?''
   De Klerk, who came to Namibia from South Africa 16 years ago,
said he felt a duty to stay and help reassure fellow Afrikaners who
do likewise.
   ``Maybe, just maybe, this is the hour of glory for the
Afrikaners, not the hour of doomsday,'' he said. ``To black people,
we've always been the damned apartheid people, the bosses. Now, we
can be what we've always preached _ true Christians who love other
people and want to help them.''

<DATELINE>WALVIS BAY, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shifting winds bring either
desert sandstorms or a cold Atlantic fog into this isolated harbor
town. It is, nonetheless, the prize in a bitter dispute.
   South Africa says it has sovereignty over the town and a patch of
surrounding desert, even though it is halfway up the Namibian coast,
more than 600 miles from the nearest part of South Africa.
   Ownership might have gone uncontested, except that Walvis Bay has
the only deepwater port serving Namibia, which is due to attain
independence after 74 years of South African rule.
   Namibian politicians want Walvis Bay. South African leaders say
Namibians, if cooperative, can use the port but will never own it.
   ``It belongs to South Africa,'' said Martinhus Botma, who
represents Walvis Bay in South Africa's Parliament. ``Just to start
dishing out property isn't wise.''
   The enclave's strategic value is high. It contains South African
army, navy and air force bases, and has the best-equipped port
between Cape Town in South Africa and Luanda in Angola.
   It is the center of Namibia's fishing industry. Major exports
such as copper and uranium go through the port, as well as essential
imports.
   The South-West African People's Organization, the
guerrilla-backed movement which hopes to govern Namibia, says South
Africa might use Walvis Bay as a springboard for raids.
   SWAPO intends to go to the World Court at the Hague in the
Netherlands to seek control over Walvis Bay. If this fails, SWAPO
leaders threaten to cut off the enclave's water and electricity.
   But municipal officials in Walvis Bay say these threats are
empty, because water is obtained from underground and electricity
can be supplied by expanding a backup power plant.
   Another option would be to build a new port or expand a small
fishing harbor at Luderitz, about 250 miles to the south. Enormous
costs would be involved.
   The enclave covers 480 square miles and has about 26,000
inhabitants _ 9,000 whites, 13,000 blacks, 4,000 people of
mixed-race.
   One long-time resident of Kuisebmond, the enclave's black
township, is SWAPO's acting president, Nathaniel Mahuilili.
   ``We will do everything possible to get Walvis Bay back, except
to beg,'' he said. ``We can't go crawling to them, saying, `Please,
boss, let us use our own harbor.'''
   If South Africa resists, Mahuilili said, blacks will leave Walvis
Bay and ``make it a spook town.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   At a time in the 1950s when Hollywood was indulging in an orgy of
remakes, wise old Sam Goldwyn observed: ``It's foolish to remake
hits. You can't make them any better than they were. What you should
remake is the flops. Those you can improve.''
   The Goldwynian theory gets a rare application with ``Dirty Rotten
Scoundrels,'' a remake of the 1964 dud, ``Bedtime Story.'' The
earlier film starred David Niven and Marlon Brando as a pair of
swindlers trying to outfox each other on the French Riviera. The
only lesson to be learned from the movie was that Marlon Brando
should not attempt comedy.
   The lesson of ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' is that expert players
and production glitter can almost offset a far-fetched script. The
film has some genuinely comedic moments, and the overall result is
pleasant if not uproarious entertainment.
   Michael Caine plays one of the title roles, a polished con man
who poses as royalty and bilks rich American women who are eager to
support his homeland's ``freedom fighters.'' Onto his turf comes
Steve Martin, a gross, nervy American who somehow manages to swindle
women with equal ease.
   Martin blackmails Caine into teaching him the polish needed to
invade the bigtime. Part of the deal is a bet: The man who first
extracts $50,000 from the next unsuspecting victim becomes king of
the mountain (which was the first title of ``Bedtime Story'').
   Along comes a naive American soap heiress (Glenne Headley) who is
almost too easy a touch for Caine. The stakes are raised: The con
artist who gets her to bed first wins the bet. But the soap heiress
is not what she seems, and complications set in.
   ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' can be jolly fun, as long as you
don't question the logic. Caine's gambit with the ladies seems
amazingly foolproof. And Martin doesn't seem bright enough to con a
kid out of a lollypop. But the two stars are a delight to watch as
they interplay with disparate comedy styles. Glenne Headly makes a
wonderful foil for both.
   Frank Oz (``The Little Shop of Horrors'') directs with a light
touch befitting the feathery material. The script is credited to
Dale Launer as well as the ``Bedtime Story'' authors, Stanley
Shapiro and Paul Henning. A major asset of ``Scoundrels'' is Miles
Goodman's witty, melodic score.
   Bernard Williams produced the Orion Pictures release. Rating: PG,
mostly for language. Running time: 110 minutes.

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Bull Durham,'' ``Defense of the
Realm,'' ``Nightfall.''
   
   ``Bull Durham'' (Orion Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated R)
   
   Life has thrown a high, hard one at Crash Davis. Destiny has made
him a minor leaguer for life, and this aging ballplayer, portrayed
by Kevin Costner in the movie ``Bull Durham,'' finds himself in
Class A ball with the Durham Bulls in the Carolina League. His job:
to turn the talented but very immature Ebby ``Nuke'' Laloosh into a
major league starting pitcher.
   Well, someone else has that job, too: Annie Savoy, played by
Susan Sarandon. She knows what it takes to make it in baseball and
the bedroom, and she plans to spend the summer making sure that Nuke
is mature enough for the majors from head to toe.
   It's not hard to figure how this triangle finally resolves
itself, but no matter. ``Bull Durham,'' written and directed by Ron
Shelton, is as bitingly funny, literate, well acted and full of
ironies as the 1970s Paddy Chayefsky gems ``Hospital'' and
``Network.''
   The script is exceptional, but give the actors their due.
Costner, who previously played Eliot Ness in ``The Untouchables,''
portrays Crash with wry perfection. Sarandon, of ``Atlantic City''
and ``Witches of Eastwick'' fame, is rivetting, intelligent and as
sexy as they come. Tim Robbins is likewise strong in the supporting
role of ``Nuke.''
   As if that weren't enough, dig the toe-tapping '50s rhythm and
blues soundtrack. That Annie, she sure has taste.
   ``Bull Durham'' is rated R, mainly for down-home locker room
language.

   ``Defense of the Realm'' (Nelson Home Entertainment. VHS-Beta,
$79.98. Rated R)
   
   Like ``The Whistleblower,'' an equally tidy little thriller,
``Defense of the Realm'' is long on atmosphere. It's worth the
rental if only to see how a Another Western Democracy has its own
dirty obsessions with state secrets.
   Gabriel Byrne plays the reporter who tumbles to the Big Story
after an old sot of a colleague (Denholm Elliott) stumbles onto it
first and dies mysteriously, apparently for a secret the shadow
government thinks is worth killing him to protect.
   It's effective to see the young reporter start to pull at the
ends of the story until a strand works loose, then put the strands
of the story together until finally ...
   Ah, but that would be telling, eh?
   Some might fault the movie's abrupt ending, but let's admonishs
these curmudgeonly souls with the old '60s epigram: ``It ain't
paranoia if they really are out to get you.''

   ``Nightfall'' (MGM-UA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $79.95. Rated PG-13)
   
   The suns of a distant planet are dying, and its inhabitants, who
have always known perpetual light, fear the creeping darkness. They
call the phenomenon ``Nightfall.''
   This sci-fi flick, based on Isaac Asimov's story of the same
name, jumps off with a decent enough premise but somehow never quite
manages to develop and pull it off. There are too many questions,
too many holes.
   Why, for instance, do these people fear darkness so much when
they use fire and understand the illumination of quartz crystals?
Why, if there is a prophecy of ``nightfall'' have they not prepared?
   Watching the dying stars is the land's leader and scientist,
played by David Birney. Meanwhile, his former wife (Sarah Douglas)
has joined a blind prophet of doom and gloom who preaches that the
blind shall lead once nightfall comes because the sighted will no
longer be able to see and will plunge to hysteria.
   While the planet loses its suns, Birney frolicks with a
mysterious and sensual stranger who has an odd affinity towards
snakes. And his daughter frolicks with a Robin Williams lookalike
who plays bells and has a brief romp with the mysterious stranger.
   Nothing is too compelling in this Julie Corman production,
written and directed by Paul Mayersberg (``The Man Who Fell to
Earth''). But keep an eye out for the scene in which Sarah Douglas
decides to give her all to the blind cult. It's outta sight.

   ``A Place Like This'' (EMI Manhattan) _ Robbie Nevil
   
   Singer Robbie Nevil's new album seems well designed for mass
success, teen fave level.
   His breathy falsetto is uncannily reminiscent of Michael Jackson.
The back cover of ``A Place Like This,'' shows him in the same
backside pose favored by George Michael in many of his videos. And,
yes, his long-haired good looks are likely to be noticed by various
cheerleading squads.
   Despite all these warning signs, ``A Place Like This'' isn't half
bad.
   Nevil favors sprightly, percolating tunes perfect for the dance
floor. Neither his melodies nor lyrics will astound anyone, but the
songs are generally well crafted and fresh.
   His semi-tropical ``Back on Holiday,'' for instance, sounds far
more alluring than the Beach Boys' moribund ``Kokomo.''
   On the jazzy ``Here I Go Again,'' Nevil adeptly switches gears.
He moves easily in and out of falsetto in a surprisingly strong
vocal performance.
   The only real complaint is that he doesn't attempt more of these
twists and turns. The dance cuts border on monotony after awhile.
   Still, ``A Place Like This'' is a decent enough place to visit.

   Concerto for Orchestra; Music for Strings, Celeste and
Percussion, by Bela Bartok; Orchestra Symphonique de Montreal,
conducted by Charles Dutoit (London)
   
   The slick-sounding Montreal Symphony renders a skillfully played
Concerto for Orchestra, clear in texture and rhythmically accurate _
but lacking in imagination. The solo winds sometimes sound a little
characterless. This is a concerto, after all.
   Dutoit is scrupulous with dynamic and tempo markings and does
prompt a wide range of colors from his fine musicians. But like some
presidential candidates, there is a need for more passion here. Such
accuracy lends a special clarity to the light, fast-moving tunes in
the second movement and the racing passages of the final movement
romp.
   The interruption of the dance-like fourth movement _ a descending
circus-like clarinet tune, followed by a razzing in the brass and
chattering winds _ could be a little raunchier. The section is a
parody of the march theme from Shostakovich's Leningrad Symphony,
which Bartok heard on the radio and despised while he was composing
the concerto in 1943.
   More satisfying is the second-billed Music for Strings. Dutoit
brings to the first movement a controlled intensity on every phrase
and spirited bouncy quality to the second. The third movement is
atmospheric, and like the final section of the concerto, Dutoit
exercises good control over the swift lines of the fourth movement.
   Buy this CD for the Music for Strings above all, unless you want
a Concerto for Orchestra like chicken paprikash without the
paprikash.

<HEAD>Star Watch: It's Hard to Get a Fix on Sean Young</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The film world has yet to get a fix on Sean
Young, whose very name contributes to the confusion.
   A first glance, though, eliminates any question about gender.
With a slender, leggy figure, near-perfect face and long dark hair,
she is obviously all woman.
   Such attributes might indicate an empty-headed set decoration.
That's about all she contributed in such films as ``Young Doctors in
Love'' and ``Stripes.'' Then last year she dazzled reviewers and
audiences with her performance as the sensuous Washington mistress
caught between Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman in ``No Way Out.'' Her
limo scene with Costner was a masterpiece of carnality.
   Young makes another strong impression in ``The Boost'' as the
dutiful wife who accompanies James Woods on a downward slide from
affluence to drug-ridden poverty.
   On a personal basis, she has aroused controversy, not all of it
self-induced. During her work on ``Wall Street,'' Charlie Sheen was
so antagonized by her serious attitude on the set that he attached
an obscene note to her back (Sheen later admitted that he was on a
bender throughout the filming). And their fellow workers report that
there was no love lost between Woods and Young during ``The Boost,''
_ this despite their lovey-dovey appearance on the screen.
   Miss Young smiled inscrutably and commented only that she found
Woods ``very intense.'' She added: ``I think he's pretty intense all
the time, though I never saw him when he was sleeping. He's intense,
and rightly so. That's one of the reasons he was so exciting to work
with. When he and I would get ready for a scene, we had great fun _
especially the first two acts of the movie where our lives are all
fun.''
   In ``The Boost,'' Woods is a supersalesman of tax shelters, Young
is the wife who gives up her career to join him in the sybaritic Los
Angeles life. When his business goes bust, Woods intensifies the
cocaine habit he has dabbled with, and she joins him.
   The actress admitted that the wife's actions do not reflect
current feminist thinking: ``I think the movie is going to have a
big impact on women viewers because of how she hands everything over
to her husband. Linda Brown is a person who has everything: She's
beautiful, capable, she's a paralegal secretary and is supporting
them while he's trying to get a break.
   ``His dream for Linda is for her to just study dance and be a
wife and eventually a mother. In fact, she is very strong, but she
decides to invest herself in this man. But he can't be the man she
wants him to be. And that's destructive to both of them.''
   It's hard to imagine Sean Young following a husband as blindly as
Linda Brown. Her life has been well calculated from the age of 13,
when she started a daily journal that she has kept ever since. The
daughter of a TV news producer and his biographer wife, she was born
in Louisville, Ky., and grew up in Ohio.
   ``I was intent on becoming successful,'' she recalled. ``When I
was 18, I read `Think and Grow Rich' by Napoleon Hill. I remember
Xeroxing the book and cutting out little pieces. It says to write
out your dream very specifically, and in the mornings and at night
say it over again.
   ``My dream wasn't really to become an actress but to become as
successful as I could be. I was a trained dancer, which I still am
today. I didn't want to do ballet anymore; it was too hard, and I
didn't get paid much money. I said, `I want more money, more
success, more than this!'
   ``I quit and became a model, and I got a lot of money for it. But
I found it was an environment that didn't utilize my intelligence.
So I quit that six months later. My mom said, `Sean, what are you
going to do?' I said I wanted to act. She had been working with a
literary agent at ICM (the talent agency) who introduced me to the
film department.''
   A month later she had her first role, in James Ivory's ``Jane
Austin in Manhattan.'' In the ensuing eight years she has had her
share of misses: ``Baby,'' ``Blade Runner'' (as an android) and the
mega-flop ``Dune'' (``I worked four months and ended up in 15
minutes of film'').
   ``I had a lot of learning to do,'' she remarked. ``Not just how
to act in front of the camera, or just how to act. But also how to
behave in terms of the system. There's a social system of behavior
within a film. Not only that, each film is different, and everybody
you work with is different. It never ends.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Tintin Turns 60</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tintin, the moon-faced Belgian comic
strip reporter who trots around in knickers in action-packed tales,
has quietly turned 60.
   The intrepid young scribe _ a trademark tuft of hair rising above
the round face with the peg nose and beady eyes _ first appeared
Jan. 29, 1929 in a cartoon strip in a weekly insert for youngsters
in La Vingtieme Siecle, a now defunct Brussels daily.
   The rest is history, or at least years of happy reading and
rereading for comic strip lovers in 30 nations who have devoured the
23 Tintin albums in any of 33 languages.
   He is called Tintin in English, French, Basque, Arabic, Spanish
and Swedish. Others call him Kuifje (Dutch), Tim (German), Tinni
(Icelandic), Tintti (Finnish), Tantan (Hebrew and Japanese) or Ten
Ten (Greek).
   His albums have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide, said
Viviane Vandeninden, organizer of ``Herge, Dessinateur'' (Herge,
Cartoonist), a retrospective of the work of Tintin's creator, George
Remy. He signed his work Herge which are his initials in French,
spelled backward.
   The show played at the Ixelles Museum in Brussels through Jan.
15, before moving to the Fine Arts Museum in Angouleme, France (Jan.
26-Feb. 15) and the Hotel de Sens museum in Paris (March 4-May 4).
   Herge died of cancer in 1983 at the age of 76. He raised the
low-key craft of comic strip drawing into an art form.
   His albums are gems of story-telling and drawing. They put Tintin
_ who never aged and only late in life exchanged his puffy pants for
slacks _ into fast-paced tales that took him from the Soviet Union
to Africa, and from the opium dens of the Far East to the
skyscrapers of America.
   He even explored the moon in two strips in the late 1940s whose
drawings remain timeless to this day.
   During his travels, Tintin found a motley collection of friends,
including Thompson and Thomson, two dimwitted, identical twin
detectives, and Archibald Haddock, a sea captain who loves whiskey
and cursing.
   The first album, ``Tintin in the Soviet Union,'' appeared in late
1929. The last strip was ``Tintin and the Picaros'' in 1976.
   The Tintin retrospective has 300 original drawings, sketches,
doodles and entire story boards by Herge whose unique style is known
as ``Ligne Claire'': solid, unbroken lines that make dramatic
perspectives. They have never before been exhibited.
   Tintin's adventures ended with Herge's death. In the 1950s and
'60s, Studio Herge employed about 12 artists, but none was allowed
to complete the 24th album that remains unfinished at page 42.
   ``Herge did not want to put Tintin in the hands of others,''
Vanderinden said. ``That is what makes Tintin unique. It's like
saying that after Beethoven, there cannot be another Beethoven.
There are other composers, but there is only one Beethoven.''
   A quiet, reserved man, Herge's personal life was in marked
contrast to that of Tintin. During his working life, he never
visited the countries to which he dispatched his hero, although
that's hard to tell from his stories: His drawings displayed a
remarkable knowledge of faraway places and customs by simply
perusing illustrated guidebooks and, especially, the National
Geographic Magazine.
   Tintin began his life as a reporter for La Vingtieme Siecle _ the
Catholic daily where Herge began in the circulation department in
1925 _ who is sent to the Soviet Union where the Communist
Revolution continues to rumble.
   In its weekly installments, the comic strip reflected the
virulently anti-communist views of La Vingtieme Siecle. The story
ran until May 8, 1930, without Herge knowing from one week to the
next where the story was going. This is evident from the early story
boards showing Tintin and Snowy, a white terrier who was to be his
life-long companion, taking a train from Brussels to Moscow.
   In the Soviet Union, Tintin ran afoul of unsavory commies who
seek to prevent him from returning home with a terrible secret _
that Russian factories are only flimsy movie-set decors, ersatz
testimony to the workers' paradise.
   ``I was inspired in my choice (of the story) by the atmosphere of
the newspaper,'' Herge said later.
   ``Tintin in the Soviet Union'' was an immediate success, even
though the story and the art work are very stilted compared with
later Herge work.
   When the story ended, Herge hired a young man who looked somewhat
like his comic strip hero, dressed him up in a Russian costume and
red boots and had him arrive by train in Brussels.
   ``I was sure no one would show up,'' Herge recalled later. ``But
to my surprise there was a crowd at the station and people held on
to the car that was to take the Tintin double home.''
   The second Tintin album sent the reporter to the then Belgian
Congo, the third to the United States.
   ``Tintin en Amerique'' (``Tintin in America'') shows the
influence of Hollywood films on Herge. The frames show more action
and suspense. In one, Tintin clings perilously high to an outside
wall of a skycraper.
   Herge long resisted switching to color. But he did so in 1947
with ``L`Etoile Mysterieuse'' (``The Mysterious Star''). By then, he
was working with assistants who developed the backdrop scenes with
Herge always drawing Tintin and the other key characters. At that
time, he redrew some of his early works, such as ``Tintin in the
Soviet Union'' and ``Tintin in the Congo'' toning down their harsh
views on Communism and Africans.
   The Tintin retrospective shows original Herge drawings that have
remained in a safe at the Herge Foundation, which commercializes the
Tintin character and promotes the works of promising young
cartoonists. They include the story boards of a hitherto unknown
Tintin story which is practically finished but which will never see
publication.
   ``It is hard to say how many original works by Herge are still
around,'' Vanderinden said. ``He gave so much away during his life.''
   Herge's death has done wonders for the price of original Herge
drawings which fetch upwards of $100,000, depending on quality.
   But then, Tintin's popularity shows no signs of fading. Only
several years ago, a re-issue of the original ``Tintin in the Soviet
Union'' quickly sold out 100,000 copies within 30 days.

<HEAD>Music Makers: New Age Music Is Not Necessarily All Bad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FERNANDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sudden gust of wind swirled through
the courtyard of a rehearsal studio, stirring a set of chimes.
   The two musician-composers sitting nearby had just been asked
whether they liked the label ``new age music'' applied to their work.
   ``That,'' laughed John Tesh, referring to the tinkling wind
chimes, ``is new age music.''
   ``And it puts me to sleep,'' said Yanni.
   Tesh, the smooth-voiced co-host of TV's ``Entertainment
Tonight,'' and Yanni, a Greek-born composer and musician, were
discussing their shared interest in so-called new age music. They
also were discussing their continual struggle to overcome new age's
lightweight reputation as music for crystal gazers.
   The meditative quality and unchallenging melodies of some music
labeled new age, has given it a deserved distinction as pretentious
and boring, the two agreed.
   ``There is no real definition for new age music, and anytime you
ask someone what new age music is, they talk for half an hour,''
said Yanni, 34, a native of Kalamata, Greece, who was a swimming
champ in his country before coming to the United States in 1973.
   The classically trained pianist, who uses only one name, settled
with his brother in Minneapolis. He learned English, and attended
the University of Minnesota, majoring in psychology, before
abandoning swimming and academics when he was first introduced to a
synthesizer and saw the possibilities.
   New York native Tesh, 36, has won two Emmys, but not for his work
on the syndicated ``Entertainment Tonight.'' The awards were for
scores he composed for the televised coverage of the Pan American
Games in 1983, and the Tour de France earlier this year. For ``Tour
de France,'' some of the compositions were completed minutes before
airtime.
   Tesh joined Yanni's band as a keyboard player for a recent
national tour to promote Yanni's ``Chameleon Days'' LP. The ``E.T.''
host worked his rehearsals around the TV show chores for a grueling
month before the band, including bassist Joyce Imbesi and drummer
Charlie Adams, hit the road.
   Their record label, Private Music, uses the term ``new music'' _
deleting ``age'' _ to describe the output of its artists, and that
may be closer to the mark. The National Academy of Recording Arts
and Sciences this year placed its new age award under the fusion
category for the 1989 Grammy Awards.
   New, new age, or jazz fusion _ whatever you call it, the music is
a product of 20 years' evolution in electronic keyboards, samplers,
synthesizers and special equipment packages which can link several
instruments at once.
   Thus a car door slamming can be turned into a snare drum sound,
as Tesh used in ``You Are Here'' from his ``Tour de France'' album.
And Yanni's dextrous use of several keyboards, which he has
programmed for each tune, has made him one of the premier performers
of electronic music.
   ``It's the revolution of sound available to composers,'' said
Yanni. ``These years are very important. ... We've heard what a
violin sounds like blended with a cello, blended with a French horn,
blended with a grand piano. We have been doing this for hundreds of
years. Now the sounds available have increased not 10 times but a
billion times.''
   One artist can control several interfaced keyboards and program
them for each song, sometimes playing sustained strings with one
hand while performing a fast piano break with the other, and all the
while engineering the sounds.
   ``The attitude by which you play the keyboard has to change,''
said Yanni. ``You have to be very flexible. You don't play the
keyboard like a piano. If you have a French horn up as a sound, you
don't go like this,'' he said, striking a imaginary piano key. ``The
mannerisms of a violin or harmonica and all that are very crucial.
... If you want a certain sound, you can't hit it hard, even if
you're excited. And that can be very difficult when you are playing
live.''
   Artists can, and do, cheat on this kind of music, with digital
audio tapes or memory chips running part of the tune while they tend
to other keyboard chores.
   Minor leaguers, charges Tesh.
   ``This is important, because when you hear these albums, people
say, `Oh, great, they spent forever in a studio and the computers
did it,'' Tesh said. ``I think it's safe to say that even the record
company was blown away to see an artist they had known for three
years stand up on stage and create the music live.''
   ``We play music the old-fashioned way, with our hands and our
feet,'' said Yanni's drummer Adams.
   Yanni's music on ``Chameleon Days'' crosses the influences he
heard growing up in Greece, including classical tunes, Greek and
Middle Eastern folk music and Western pop songs. His other Private
Music albums include ``Keys to Imagination'' and ``Out of Silence.''
He also has done scoring for films, including HBO's ``Steal the
Sky,'' and his music also has been used for NBC's coverage of the
Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea.
   His sound is intense, layered and opulent, ``music that works
with pictures,'' as colleague Tesh described it.
   ``I allow myself many liberties that aren't normally allowed in
rock 'n' roll or jazz,'' said Yanni. ``If I was writing new age
music, only about three minutes of the album would be there.''
   Tesh said his job on ``E.T.'' allows him to indulge his passion
for music. He has built his own studio and the afternoons off give
him the freedom to compose and experiment, he said.
   On the television show, ``I fight to do all the music
interviews,'' he said. ``When I interview a Peter Gabriel, or Huey
Lewis, or Anita Baker, I ask them all the questions `E.T.' wants,''
said Tesh. ``Then we turn off the camera and I say, `Now, on the
third cut, what was that great sound you got?'''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Writers In Post-Revolutionary Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In less than 10 years since the
Sandinista revolution, a nation that didn't even have a publishing
house has managed to produce more than 200 titles and a crop of
native authors.
   ``This is part of the revolutionary process,'' said Roberto Diaz
Castillo, director of the state-owned New Nicaragua publishing
company. ``Before the revolution the most important literary figures
weren't published in Nicaragua.''
   Indeed, Nicaragua produced one of the Hispanic world's great
poets, Ruben Dario, who died in 1916. But although Dario is revered
as a strongly nationalist poet, he lived outside the country for
most of his life.
   Under the long rule of the Somoza family that began in 1936,
there was censorship and little encouragement from the state
regarding the arts. However, the Sandinistas, who took over after a
revolutionary war in 1979, put a lot of emphasis on all forms of
culture. Artists, dancers, musicians and writers are ecouraged by
several government organizations.
   Still, writers who don't tow the Sandinista line have trouble
getting published, said Pablo Antonio Cuadra, a noted poet and
director of the opposition newspaper La Prensa, which has been
involved in frequent bitter conflict with the Sandinista government.
   ``The Sandinistas say I'm the only poet opposed to the regime,
but there are a lot of disenchanted poets,'' he said.
   ``Some of our best young poets are in exile _ in Texas, in
Venezuela. They're not Contras, but they are not Sandinistas,
either,'' said Cuadra, interviewed by telephone in Austin, Texas,
where he has taken leave from La Prensa to write a study of Central
American literature with the help of a grant from the Guggenheim
Foundation.
   Diaz Castillo said New Nicaragua wanted to publish one of
Cuadra's books two years ago; Cuadra said he refused because he has
a contract with a Costa Rican publisher and he also suspected the
Sandinistas were trying to score propaganda points by publishing a
symbolic book by an opponent.
   The roots and implications of the Sandinista revolution are the
dominant subjects of New Nicaragua's list. Many of the ruling
Sandinista leaders themselves are writers, and a list of authors
from New Nicaragua can look like a who's who of the government.
   Vice President Sergio Ramirez is a novelist. Agrarian Reform
Minister Jaime Wheelock is a historian. First lady Rosario Murillo
is a poet, as is former culture minister Ernesto Cardenal.
   The emphasis on the arts led to an outpouring of poetry.
Romantic, revolutionary war poems, once relegated to the backs of
clandestine notebooks, made it into print.
   Gioconda Belli, one the nation's most popular poets, writes rich
odes that couple love, eroticism and strong hope of a better
tomorrow. Murillo, the common-law wife of the president, also writes
mostly love poems based on the ideals of the revolution.
   ``Gioconda Belli is a good poet,'' said Cuadra. ``But remember,
she's a Sandinista.''
   The man considered by most as Nicaragua's finest living poet,
Carlos Martinez Rivas, is on New Nicaragua's list but of a
generation apart from the revolution. One of his poems is a tribute
to Charles Darwin, another a four-line poem called ``Retrospection
1940-1980.''
   Ramirez, vice president and one of the most popular novelists,
recently published ``Castigo Divino,'' or ``Divine Punishment.'' It
was first printed in Spain, and he went to a round of publication
parties in Spain and Mexico, where it sells for about $20. The New
Nicaragua edition is doing well here despite the price, the
equivalent of almost $2, close to a week's pay for many Nicaraguans.
   The book, a spicy fictionalized account of a scandalous murder in
the 1930s, was also serialized in the Sunday supplement of the
pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario.
   ``The theme shows that a leader in the revolution doesn't
necessarily have to write about the revolution,'' Ramirez said.
``The only political part of this book is that all the earnings will
be used for a war fund.''
   Ramirez said the proceeds would be donated to children orphaned
during the seven-year war with anti-Sandinista rebels.
   He was asked in a recent interview how he finds time to turn out
books: ``It takes discipline, especially with my schedule. But I
just sit and write,'' he said.
   One of the most popular writers is Omar Cabezas, whose 1982 book
``La Montana Es Algo Mas Que Una Inmensa Estepa Verde'' was
translated into English and sold as ``Fire on the Mountain.''
   The story of his days as a guerrilla fighter was Nicaragua's best
seller, with more than 100,000 copies in four editions, Diaz
Castillo said.
   Cabezas just released his second work, a sequel entitled
``Cancion de Amor Para Los Hombres,'' or ``A Love Song for Men.'' A
review in the Sandinista party newspaper Barricada described the
book as ``not only as good as the one before, but superior in some
cases.''
   Diaz Castillo, the director of one of two state-run publishing
houses, said he receives many unsolicited manuscripts but the
nation's economic crunch forced a cut in production.
   When the company started in 1981, Diaz Castillo said, ``We
printed 6,000 copies of five books. In four months we were all sold
out. It was an adventure.''
   Today, New Nicaragua is one of two state-run houses and publishes
about 20 books a year, most of them by young authors writing about
the revolution, including stories about battles, feminist stories
and stories about Augusto Cesar Sandino, who gave his name to the
Sandinista Front.
   Cuadra said he likes Ramirez' short stories. He compared
``Castigo Divino'' to a non-fiction novel such as Truman Capote's
``In Cold Blood,'' but said he thought only someone in Ramirez'
position would get away with writing such a book.
   ``Sometimes I think it's better if the state doesn't get
interested in literature,'' Cuadra said. ``It's better if it remains
free.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Statler Brothers `Just Dull'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 25 years of singing country music, the
Statler Brothers have appeared in more than 400 cities, given 1,600
concerts and visited every state but Alaska.
   They have performed for Presidents Nixon, Carter and Reagan.
They've released 40 albums and won 42 music awards, including three
Grammys.
   But despite their prolonged popularity, lead Statler singer Don
Reid says, ``I guess we're just dull.''
   They've hardly stirred up a shred of controversy during their
quarter century on America's stages. They are four family men with
bedrock values appealing to the heartland with grassroots songs
about love, nostalgia and growing up in small town USA.
   Even though they are associated with a musical genre known for
its songs about beer and bourbon, the Statler Brothers are shown on
their current album cover sitting around a pitcher of lemonade.
   ``We try not to get involved in anything controversial,'' Reid
said. ``We entertain and keep it light. We leave the messages to
Western Union.''
   Among their 51 hits are ``Flowers on the Wall,'' ``I'll Go to My
Grave Loving You,'' ``Atlanta Blue,'' ``Elizabeth,'' ``My Only
Love,'' ``Maple Street Memories,'' ``Class of 57'' and ``Too Much on
My Heart.''
   They won a Grammy Award in 1965 for their crossover hit ``Flowers
on the Wall'' over other finalists that included the Beatles. Now
the Statler Brothers are headed for the 1990s with a solid country
sound and a legion of loyal fans.
   In an intense industry of egos and constant changes, the foursome
have recorded for Mercury-Polygram for 18 years and used the same
producer, Jerry Kennedy, whom they affectionately call ``the fifth
Statler Brother.'' In November, they signed a long-term contract
with the same label.
   ``We try to stay fresh and deliver something people can depend
on,'' Reid said. ``We're not out to shock or carry a message. We
don't jump on fads. We try to be stable and make it quality.''
   The tightly knit quartet, taking their name from a brand of
tissues, were discovered by country star Johnny Cash in the
mid-1960s. They've had just one personnel change since then, when
Lew DeWitt left the group because of illness in 1982 and was
replaced by Jimmy Fortune, a former service writer at a car
dealership.
   Harold Reid (Don's brother) and Phil Balsley are the remaining
two members. The two Reids and Balsley grew up together in Staunton,
Va., a town of 22,000 where they continue to live.
   ``We're still close,'' Don Reid said.
   The Reids and Balsley are elders at their Presbyterian church and
the Reids have both coached in youth baseball leagues. Their offices
are in the elementary school they attended as youngsters.
   ``We try to be normal,'' Don Reid said. ``We stay out of the
mainstream of show business life. We come back to Virginia and live
here. We try to be normal U.S. citizens and our music reflects that.
We try not to be `show bizzy' and people see that. We never wanted
to change from what we were when we grew up in Staunton.''
   Despite the hit records and awards, Don Reid says the biggest
thrill is still performing in concert. Before resuming their road
trips in late January after six weeks off, they had performed 1,625
concerts in 421 cities in the past 25 years.
   ``There have been a lot of good things happening to us like the
awards and the visits to the White House, but the biggest spark is
hitting the stage,'' he said. ``Without that hour out there, it
wouldn't be worthwhile. There's an all-time high every night. It's
born in you and you never quite lose it. If you do, you should hang
it up.''
   Alaska is the only state where they've not performed.
   ``There are just a few cities there to work,'' Don Reid said.
   The four, dubbed by novelist Kurt Vonnegut as ``America's
poets,'' are resourceful and a bit superstitious.
   At every recording session, Don Reid has carried a battered green
hat into the studio. He doesn't often wear it, just hangs it off a
mike boom where he can see it.
   ``I'm not real superstitious but I don't like to go against the
grain,'' he said. ``It became a habit and I carried it to all the
sessions. It's the only place I ever take it. I would hate to lose
it.''
   To create their own sound effects for fight noise for a song,
they collected soft drink bottles and threw them against the wall in
the studio.
   ``It was a horrible mess,'' Harold Reid said.

<TEXT>
   Carnegie Hall reopened in late 1986 with a
musical question: Had an extensive interior renovation harmed the
hall's magic sound?
   No way, said Larry Goldman, Carnegie's vice president. Hadn't
management been so meticulous as to remove padding from the new
seats after tests showed they absorbed more sound than the old ones?
   Goldman said he ``never worried about the acoustics.'' He should
have.
   Two years later, many critics and audience members have decided
that Carnegie's old sound has gone the way of its old seats.
   In a tacit admission that something was lost, sound-absorbent
panels have been placed at the rear of the stage, but so far the
results are inconclusive; the hall may have only begun a long search
for its lost sonic glory.
   Carnegie's problems raise anew the question of whether acoustics
is science, art or magic _ or luck.
   ``To a certain extent you're shooting craps,'' admits Cyril
Harris, an acoustician for almost 40 years. ``There isn't a
scientific standard for good sound. Different people have different
ideas, depending on what they're used to.''
   Sometimes, local tastes enter into the equation. Earlier in this
century, for example, Bostonians were accustomed to Symphony Hall's
longer reverberation time, Philadelphians to the shorter one in the
smaller Academy of Music.
   Orchestras and conductors, who didn't travel much, were shaped by
their halls. Philadelphia audiences loved the sound of the
Philadelphia Orchestra's strings. When the Boston Symphony Orchestra
visited town, the strings sounded muddy; the Bostonians didn't keep
their bows on the strings as long.
   Musicians, critics and acousticians trade terms such as
``brilliant'' and ``dry'' like connoisseurs at a wine tasting.
Sometimes they even mean the same thing. But there is broad
agreement on what constitutes good sound, and a solid understanding
of the physical laws of acoustics.
   When you sit in a concert hall you hear two kinds of sound:
direct, which comes straight from the stage, and reflected, which
bounces _ off the wall, the ceiling, the shoulder of the person in
the next seat _ before hitting your ear.
   The first reflected sound should hit the ear 20 to 60
milliseconds after leaving the stage, and it should reverberate for
just under two seconds _ the approximate time in such great halls as
Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, Boston's Symphony Hall and Vienna's
Grosser Musikvereinsaal.
   Most of the world's great music halls date from the late 19th
century, and share a rectangular layout; irregular, highly
ornamented interior surfaces that scatter sound; heavy plaster and
wood, which reflect sound well; and fewer than 2,800 seats.
   The concert hall evolved slowly from traditional performance
spaces such as churches and salons, and successful early designers
relied less on inspiration or theory than euphonious precedents.
This preserved some happy accidents, such as the sound diffusion
affected by elaborate wall decoration.
   But pity the 19th century designer who sought to understand what
he was doing. Listen to the great Charles Garnier, architect of the
Paris Opera House:
   ``I gave myself great pains to understand this great science, but
after 15 years of labor found myself hardly in advance of where I
stood the first day. I studied, tested, questioned everything, and I
made finally this discovery: A house to have good acoustics must be
either long or broad, high or low, of wood or stone, round or
square....''
   In fact, the Paris Opera looks better than it sounds; its dome
distributes sound unevenly.
   Garnier's befuddlement might have seemed quaint to the elegantly
dressed patrons who filed in on opening night at Lincoln Center's
Philharmonic Hall in 1962. Millions of dollars and years of
research, they were assured, had created a sonic masterpiece. But by
intermission people were complaining. ``You'd see the basses
playing, but you couldn't hear them,'' recalls Cyril Harris.
   The consultants had designed acoustic ``clouds,'' or ceiling
panels, to reflect sound, but Harris believes low-frequency sound
waves bent around them instead. As a result, some bass sounds were
lost in the rafters. Matters likely were not helped by
Philharmonic's sleek, spare interior and bottle shape.
   Harris was last in a parade of consultants who over the next 16
years tried to improve the hall's acoustics. Finally, it was closed
for six months while the interior was rebuilt at a cost of one-third
the construction price.
   Most say acoustics in the hall _ rechristened Avery Fisher Hall _
are much improved. But it continues to share the ``cold'' sound of
many modernist concert halls built after World War II.
   Money is part of the problem. Halls without government subsidies
need more seats, sometimes too many for good sound. And many must
accommodate a variety of performances, from symphonic music to opera
to drama, with varying needs.
   Changes in a hall can also wreak sonic havoc, though it is not
always clear why. In Carnegie's case, one theory is that the new
floor, stage, carpet, paint and plaster ``stiffened'' the
auditorium, increasing reverberation. Another blames the removal of
stage curtains and the filling of a hole in the acoustic shell over
the stage _ moves intended to improve the sound in the front rows.
   Whatever the cause, the result was a loss of deep bass resonance
and a reverberation that can verge on echo. Even more seriously,
some musicians have complained of some difficulty hearing each other.
   Despite some well-publicized fiascos, acousticians and architects
are better equipped than ever, and experts say the results are
particularly apparent in halls on college campuses and in smaller
communities.
   Acousticians have learned how to shape walls that scatter sound
in the fashion of three-dimensional wall surfaces. They also use
``quadratic residue diffusers'' _ textured panels mounted on
ceilings or walls that splay sound out around a room.
   Lasers can show how light waves bounce around a room, giving a
clue to how sound waves move through the same space; computers make
it feasible to compile and analyze huge amounts of sound test data;
models can highlight gross defects before construction.
   The designers of the Orange County, Calif., Performing Arts
Center, for example, built a one-tenth scale model out of the same
materials as the actual building. They inserted tiny microphones and
ran sound tests to make sure the unusual asymmetric design reflected
sound to the audience soon enough.
   Electronically assisted resonance was first used in 1964 at the
Royal Festival Hall in London, whose acoustic problems stemmed from
a ceiling 12 feet too low. Rather than raise the roof, management
installed a series of speakers, each with a microphone and an
amplifier tuned to a certain low-frequency band. The result was
increased reverberation.
   A more recent development is something called a reflected energy
system, which picks up the sound from the stage and processes it
electronically to add sonic reflections. Since such systems can be
tinkered with, some critics worry that natural sound will be lost in
the search for perfect sound. But advocates say that given the
conflicting demands on the multi-purpose concert hall, nature can
use a little help.

<HEAD>New Questions Being Raised About Medical Ethics Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a country where doctors hold almost absolute
authority over care and questions about diagnosis and treatment are
discouraged, some doctors say patients' rights are poorly protected
and ethical standards are weak.
   The Japanese have the world's longest life expectancy, thanks in
part to affordable medical care. However, a recent editorial in The
Japan Times said the health insurance system is ``conducive to
questionable practices, ranging from illegal billing and
overcharging to the practice of prescribing drugs unnecessarily in
order to claim reimbursements.''
   Doctors also are ill-prepared to handle ethical decisions such as
whether patients will be informed about their illnesses and
treatment, says Dr. Takashi Sugimura, president of Japan's National
Cancer Center. Only three or four of 80 medical schools offer
courses in ethics, Kyoto University researchers say.
   ``It seems that ethical education of researchers is rather
lacking,'' noted writer Seiichi Murase in a commentary to the
Mainichi Shimbun daily.
   The Medical Ethics Council has suspended doctors for illegal
activities, but few convicted of malpractice spend time in jail. And
given the difficulties of maintaining acceptable standards for
conventional medicine, the relatively new fields of microbiology and
genetics pose even greater challenges.
   Key issues facing those responsible for setting ethical
guidelines include brain death, artificial insemination and the
determination of an embryo's sex using amniocentesis, said Dr.
Michio Okamoto, head of the ethics council.
   Doctors say the insurance system forces them to see an average
100 patients a day to break even. Because much of their fee come
from prescriptions, they prescribe massive quantities of often
unneeded drugs to boost their incomes.
   Japan has about 165 doctors for every 100,000 people, compared
with 200 in the United States, according to the Ministry of Health
and Welfare. Since few doctors take appointments, many patients wait
hours in crowded hospitals or clinics to spend one or two minutes
with a doctor.
   Medical care for 1988 was an estimated $157 billion, about $1,240
per person, of which government and company health insurance plans
cover 70 percent to 90 percent. The government is seeking ways to
reduce fraud and make patients foot more of the bill, which is
expected to rise dramatically as the elderly population grows from
10.3 percent to 16.3 percent by the year 2000.
   Japanese women can expect to live to 81.39 years and men 75.61
years. The average U.S. life expectancy is 74.9 years.
   By 2025, Japan's medical expenses could balloon to $800 billion,
according to the United Nations Population Research Institute.
   Such an enormous system tends to lure unlicensed profit-seekers.
   The Patients Rights Conference discovered a couple who set up a
maternity clinic without qualified staff and recommended or carried
out up to 1,000 unnecessary hysterectomies. The couple received
suspended sentences.
   In October, Dr. Kiyoshi Kato, who treated thousands of cancer
patients with massage and a diet similar to infant formula, was
fined the equivalent of $800.
   Japanese cultural taboos make the patient-doctor relationship
even more difficult, says Sugimura of the National Cancer Center.
   Taboos against mutilation of the dead, coupled with the
reluctance of doctors to approach family members for organ removal,
has led to a shortage of kidneys for transplant. There were 572
kidney transplants in Japan in 1987, but the Japan Society for
Transplantation says 9,000 people can't get a transplant.
   Cancer is another taboo. When a lump is found, instead of
suggesting a biopsy, ``doctors tell people to come back two or three
months later. That's dangerous because people who don't want to know
will never go back. Japanese aren't used to the idea of second
opinions,'' said Takako Watt, founder of Akebonokai, a Tokyo support
group for breast cancer patients.
   Cancer patients who do know of their illness receive minimal
support. Unlike Akebonokai, most hospital support groups require a
five-year survival record for membership. ``They don't realize
people really need support while they're sick,'' Mrs. Watt said.
   Informing a patient about a terminal illnesses is also generally
taboo, Sugimura said, although surveys show that only 20 percent of
Japanese do not want to be told if they had terminal cancer.

<HEAD>Something Always Smells At The Center For Odor Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN GEORGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ever try to describe the odor of an old
sock? You know, that sweaty survivor of tennis matches and pickup
basketball games, the kind you don't need any hands to step into?
   We all know the smell, and perhaps words like ``musty'' or
``moldy'' come to mind. But they aren't really exact, and in the end
most of us give up.
   ``It just stinks,'' we say. ``It smells like an old sock.''
   That's the kind of thing that intrigues Dr. Tom Orofino, director
of the William H. Wheeler Center for Odor Research.
   Don't turn up your nose. Orofino says olfactory science has many
uses, even though some experts dismiss smell as less important than
other senses.
   ``Certainly on evolutionary terms, it was extremely important,''
Orofino said. ``There are many species today that never did get
around to developing sight and get along just fine, like moles.
   ``The reason smell is not so important to humans is because we
don't use it. We don't need to. There are all kinds of other assists
in life.''
   The center, at the University of Tennessee, is one of only a few
in the country. It was established in 1986 with a $500,000 gift from
the estate of the man who founded Airwick Industries, maker of room
deodorizers.
   Its purpose is any research that furthers knowledge about odors.
   And even though there are an estimated 500,000 scents, the
research is limited _ in part by the difficulty people have
describing smells.
   ``Descriptions of odors are basically through associations with
something else,'' Orofino said. ``There is a very meager vocabulary
in terms of describing odors in a fundamental sense.''
   Another problem is that even among humans, the ability to smell
varies widely. About 2 percent of the population has no sense of
smell at all, while other people are limited by an olfactory version
of color blindness.
   And unlike sight and sound, it's difficult to measure smell.
   ``Things like audition and vision have a spectrum you can refer
to, a rainbow of color, sound frequencies and so on. Smell does
not,'' said Orofino, who hopes a couple of Wheeler Center projects
can improve the situation.
   Psychology professor Edward Green spent months examining how
people associate odors with colors, hoping to find a link between
the two. He found that women were more descriptive than men in
connecting scents to colors, such as the smell of a lemon to yellow.
   ``It turns out men operate under a special handicap. Their noses
aren't very good and they don't have very good color
discrimination,'' Green said. But even women were limited to smells
they knew and could not associate colors with unfamiliar scents, so
any odor-color connection appears to be learned.
   Still, the information could be useful in packaging and marketing
products, he said. ``People do learn to associate odors with all
sorts of things. So from the standpoint of the fragrance industry,
they have an enormous opportunity, given a unique product, to
establish their own kind of conditioning.''
   Orofino's research focuses on the relationship between the
molecular structure of a chemical and its odor, which could let
chemists more accurately regulate scents and create new ones. ``The
perfume industry would be delighted to come up with artificial
substitutes for lilacs or geraniums or whatever they might put in
their perfumes and not have to do it by trial and error.''
   The study of smells also benefits the medical profession since
some diseases, like typhoid and diabetes, cause odors and others,
like Alzheimer's disease, cause smelling deficiencies, he said.
``There's some belief that the sense of smell is the external
version of the immune system, that by smelling certain things,
there's actually a connection to the immune system that produces the
necessary reaction antibodies to counter it.''
   Scientists suspect that some odors may actually have a
physiological impact on people and may cause a change in their
physical or emotional state, he said. Greater knowledge about such
an effect could be used to stop physical responses that lead to such
problems as high blood pressure and migraine headaches.
   ``The nice thing about this field,'' said Green, ``is that
anything you find out is new.''

<TEXT>
   Archeologists
hope to begin digging this spring for equipment discarded by
soldiers of the Seventh Cavalry as they retreated after the June 25,
1876, defeat at Little Bighorn.
   Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer and about 215 men were wiped out
by Sioux and Cheyenne. Six companies under Maj. Marcus Reno and
Capt. Frederick Benteen dug in a few miles away on bluffs above the
Little Bighorn River. Much of what is known about Custer's last day
comes from survivors under Reno and Benteen.
   The National Park Service wants to survey a site that was
identified as the place where, according to historic accounts, Reno
and Benteen's men destroyed everything they couldn't carry away or
repair after the two-day siege ended.
   There probably won't be any startling revelations about the
battle, but the dump could serve as a time capsule of military gear
in use on the Plains during the era, said Doug Scott of the Midwest
Archeological Center at Lincoln, Neb.
   Scott, a leader of 1984 and 1985 surveys that identified the
site, said he will be looking for pieces of saddles and tack, and
nails from ammunition and ration boxes that could support accounts
of soldiers using the boxes as fuel.
   Horse gear could show what saddles the ies don't threaten
residents' health, said Don Bayly, assistant chief of the city
Bio-Environmental Services Division. ``It's just a nuisance, not a
health matter or violation.''

   A company whose president wants to launch the U.S.
space station into orbit on a Soviet rocket booster has signed a
contract to promote Soviet space science services, data and hardware.
   Space Commerce Corp. will handle public relations, market Soviet
satellites _ including a new satellite-borne nuclear reactor _ and
provide engineering and technical services, said company president
Arthur M. Dula. He signed a contract with Glavcosmos, the civilian
Soviet space agency, Dec. 19 in New York, and it became official
Jan. 4 when Alexander E. Dunayev, head of Glavcosmos, signed it in
Moscow. Terms were not disclosed.
   ``The Soviet Union is going to have a commercial space program,
there is no question about that,'' Dula said. ``The only question is
whether an American company is going to work with them to make it
real.''
   Dula wants to launch America's space station, Freedom, now in its
design and development stage, on the giant Soviet rocket Energia,
the world's mightiest rocket, sometime in the 1990s.
   ``It would save the American taxpayers about $5 billion,'' he
said.
   U.S. observers have said it might take as many as 18 shuttle
missions, just in the first phase, to put Freedom into space. The
Energia could put the space station in orbit with two launches.
   Space Commerce Corp. is a privately-held Texas corporation with
about 40 shareholders formed in January 1987.

   An Alabama power cooperative has started building
the nation's first commercial power project that will draw on a huge
reserve of compressed air to help generate electricity.
   The air will be stored in a cavern measuring some 19 million
cubic feet, roughly one-third the space enclosed by Houston's
Astrodome.
   When a generating plant to be built above the cavern starts
working in 1991, it will help meet peak power demands during the
air-conditioning months of June through August, said John Howard of
Alabama Electric Cooperative.
   The $50 million project offers a less expensive way to meet
intermittent power demands than the conventional alternative,
project officials say.
   During periods of slack demand, the plant will compress air and
pump it into the cavern, using electricity generated by other
plants. The air will be stored at up to about 1,100 pounds per
square inch, more than 30 times the pressure found in automobile
tires.
   To generate electricity later, the plant will withdraw compressed
air, heat it and run it through its turbines.
   In contrast, a conventional plant for meeting periodic peaks
compresses air at the time it generates electricity, using natural
gas as fuel, said Peter Totten of Gibbs &amp; Hill Inc., a New York firm
serving as architects and engineers for the Alabama project.
   The Alabama approach will save money because using electricity
from the other plants is less expensive than burning natural gas to
compress air, he said.
   About a dozen American utilities are seriously looking at
compressed-air power plants, said Robert Schainker, manager of the
energy storage program at the Electric Power Research Institute in
Palo Alto, Calif.
   Such plants are ``very economically attractive'' for supplying
power more than four or five hours a day but less than 12 hours a
day, he said.
   One project has been operating in West Germany since 1978, he
said. Another is being built in the Soviet Union, and another is
planned in Israel, he said.

   Use your imagination and you can make over an entire room with a
single small tool _ a variable-power staple gun.
   Selecting such a stapler for multiple uses requires the choice of
one with multiple features.
   One such heavy-duty staple gun has a setting for use on materials
like hardwood, which needs the maximum power, and one for use on
such materials as gypsum wallboard, which needs only the minimum
amount of power. A rehammer feature allows restriking of protruding
staples.
   Also, consider the staple gun's ``pull,'' or the amount of
strength required to compress its handle and shoot off a staple, as
well as its weight in your hand. Remember, the first pull always
seems easier _ and the staple gun lighter _ at the start rather the
end of a long project.
   The ``easy pull'' handle requires just a squeeze, so that you
don't have to be as strong as Arnold Schwarzenegger to use it. It
has a lightweight non-steel frame. Designed for heavy duty use, it
carries a two-year warranty, another important feature. And its warm
orange color seems more user-friendly than the chrome finish of
other staplers.
   You can insulate new exterior walls by installing roll-type
insulation. Start from the top and work downward on walls, stapling
to the inside or outside edges of framing.
   Set the gun on maximum power and use large nine-sixteenth inch
staples. Drive the first staple through the top edge of the
insulation roll into the stud. Stretch tightly and drive in a second
staple, repeating until done. The vapor barrier is installed on the
inside, towards the heated areas. Use work gloves, eye protection
and mask to cover nose and mouth.
   Mark Furlong, manager of the staple gun division of Emhart Home
Products, says you can panel a room easily with a staple gun and
nailpins. Traditional paneling continues to be popular, but paneling
is also available in a wide variety of designs and colors and can
even resemble wallpaper.
   Most paneling is sold in standard 4-foot by 8-foot sheets, though
some home centers will cut to size on request. Set the staple gun
power dial on ``maximum'' and use nine-sixteenth inch nailpins to
secure the paneling in place.
   Spacing of the nailpins depends on surfaces: on wood framing,
space nailpins from 6 inches to 8 inches; on gypsum wallboard, space
from 10 inches to 12 inches. Be sure the paneling is tight against
fastening surface. To assure a customized look, use the nailpins to
add molding.
   To create an accent wall, apply upholstery fabric directly to one
or two walls to dramatically change the focus of an entire room and
cover a lifeless blank wall or outdated paneling. Fabrics with
smaller random patterns will be easier to work with than those with
straight lines. Large open designs may show seams. Mix or match your
selection of fabric colors according to your room colors.
   Measure wall area carefully and don't forget above doors and
around windows. Add 6 inches to lengths for pattern alignment. Find
square inches, divide by the width of material, less 2 inches for
seams. Convert into yardage. When cutting fabric, allow an extra 6
inches in length to align patterns. Shift lengths of material up or
down to match. Machine stitch with one-inch seams and press.
   Start installation first in the upper left-hand corner. Stretch
fabric taut 4 feet along ceiling and tack into place. Set the gun's
adjustable power dial to ``minimum'' for wallboard or ``maximum'' to
cover paneling and three-eighth inch staples. Staple down the left
hand side, keeping pattern aligned vertically. Space staples 3
inches apart. Then staple the fabric taut along the ceiling, down
the right side and across the bottom.
   Trim excess with a razor knife and straightedge. Cover stapled
fabric edges along the floor, ceiling and corners with wood molding
or upholstery welt. Install with the staple gun and nine-sixteenth
inch nailpins. Space nailpins 10 inches apart on molding; on welt,
space 6 inches apart, keeping taut.

   One of the misconceptions about the care of wooden shakes on the
outside of a house is that they should be allowed to ``season'' for
as long as a year before a coating is applied.
   Wrong, say the experts. It takes only a month before the outer
surface of the wood develops a loose layer of dead cells. Coatings
will not adhere to a loose surface.
   One of those experts, John Oberle, technical director of Benjamin
Moore &amp; Co., advises homeowners to coat the shakes as soon as
weather permits.
   ``If the season has been generally dry,'' he says, ``and you have
had two or three days of good weather, the chances are your shakes
are dry enough for coating.''
   Shakes can be finished in a number of ways: with stains, paints,
clear coatings or not at all. Left to weather naturally in harsh
environments, the resulting layer of loose cells turns cedar an
attractive gray.
   This outer layer stays in place and offers some protection to
underlying layers. Left untreated, however, shakes can sometimes
weather unevenly, creating a non-uniform appearance. They can also
develop unattractive stains.
   To preserve the beauty of cedar's natural color, shakes can be
treated with clear coatings that penetrate the wood and require very
little upkeep. Not only do they permit cedar to hold its original
color and appearance, but many offer the added advantages of
repelling water and protecting against wood rot.
   Stains, often applied to shakes to achieve a more Colonial look,
range from semitransparent to solid. Semitransparent stains allow
both texture and grain to show through.
   Opaque stains obscure a bit more of the texture, but obliterate
the grain and do not build up a thick film the way paint does.
Because they penetrate the wood rather than adhere to its surface,
stains are also less likely to peel.
   Paint is the coating of choice for a smoother, more contemporary
look. Untreated cedar requires a base coat of primer before painting
because the wood contains soluble materials which may bleed through
to the surface. To avoid stains showing through the paint, Oberle
says, one or more coats of a bleed-resistant primer must be used.
Both oil-and water-based systems are available for this purpose.
   Once the proper primer has been applied, painting is easy. As
common sense would dictate, just paint vertically with _ not against
_ the grain. For those who prefer them, special applicator pads are
available for painting shakes.
   Over the years, untreated shakes eventually wear out and need
replacing. Paint provides the most protection against deterioration.
followed by opaque stains. Semitransparent and clear coatings
require more frequent reapplication.
   Before a new coating can be applied over the old, the surface of
shakes must be free of loose or peeling paint, mildew and the chalky
residue that often results from natural degradation of the initial
coating.
   If the wood is badly weathered, Oberle advises, it's often wise
to use another coat of primer before applying the top coat. Mildew
is easily removed with a solution of one-part laundry bleach to
four-parts water. Commercial mildew washes are also available.
   Because each added coat of semitransparent stain reduces the
visibility of the grain, it can be hard to anticipate how the
finished job will look. Test the stain first on a small, obscure
area of the house.
   If you don't like the result, you can step up to an opaque stain
or paint. When clear-coated shakes begin to look silvery, it's time
for recoating. A new clear coat penetrates the wood and gives the
house a rich, fresher look.
   When structural changes are made to the exterior of a house, new
shakes must be matched to the original color. The task is often
tricky.
   ``If you're trying to match shakes of different ages, the best
you can do is minimize the difference,'' Oberle says. ``New shakes
and old shakes have different textures.'' He recommends enlisting
the help of a paint dealer.
   According to the National Paint and Coatings Association, shakes
may be finished with highly satisfactory results ``if a top quality
material, made by a reputable manufacturer and distributed by a
reputable dealer, is applied in accordance with label directions.
   ``The most important single factor in obtaining a satisfactory
finish job is to follow the manufacturer's instructions.''

   Bubbling, flaking and peeling of paint used on masonry have a
number of causes. The most common are the chemical nature of the
masonry itself and the use of the wrong type of paint.
   Moisture in the masonry mix, seepage of moisture through porous
masonry from natural sources and a condition called efflorescence
are other reasons for the paint failures.
   But there is a way to keep paint on masonry walls and ceilings.
Proper surface preparation and the use of the right products can
almost guarantee a long-lasting paint job on any masonry surface.
   Man-made forms of masonry change from an easily formed plastic
state to rock-like hardness through a chemical change. Once cured,
the surface may be either acidic or alkaline, depending on the type
of masonry used.
   To avoid paint failure caused by pH extremes on the surface of
newly cured concrete, wait at least 30 days before painting. The pH
problem will fade as the masonry ages.
   Moisture is the biggest culprit in paint failure, whether the
surface is masonry or wood. But masonry presents its own special set
of problems.
   Masonry is porous, so water can penetrate and seep through the
entire structure. As it penetrates through to a painted area, water
pushes the paint off. A basement wall that leaks after a rainstorm
is a common example of this problem.
   In many cases, says Richard Barako, lab safety coordinator at
United Gilsonite, application of a masonry waterproofing paint will
solve the problem of seepage.
   Of course, if you have basement walls that leak, you should
correct the cause of the leaking first. Look for improper grading
that carries runoff toward the foundation rather than away; damaged
gutters and downspouts, and malfunctioning foundation drainage
systems.
   Masonry surfaces frequently develop a condition called
``efflorescence.'' This condition is typified by chalky white stains
on brick or concrete block walls. Efflorescence results when soluble
salts present in the masonry mixture are carried to the surface by
water. The water evaporates, leaving the salts behind in the form of
white stains. No paint, not even one specially formulated for
masonry, will adhere to efflorescence. To remove it, you must
``etch'' the surface.
   Masonry is etched by using muriatic acid or an etching product
that is milder than muriatic acid but adequate for the job. After
mixing the acid according to directions, apply it using a brush to
be sure it gets in all the pores.

   Decorating fashions run in cycles, and every cycle is slightly
different, incorporating the style and the materials of its time.
   In room decor, moldings are coming ``in'' again, but their use is
subtle, in keeping with the color-consciousness of our time. And,
they come in a variety of materials, although wood is still the
consumers' No. 1 preference.
   In our grandparents' day, moldings were big, ornate, and usually
dark (like the paints and wallpapers of the day). The pendulum
swung, and for many years minimal room accents were the style. Door
and window frame trims became simpler, while chair rails and crown
moldings (the trim that separates _ and integrates _ ceiling and
walls) went out of fashion altogether.
   As today's do-it-yourself decorators turn once again to
decorative moldings to top off their rooms, they're choosing lighter
moldings in less intricate patterns. The most popular trims are
traditional in style, but modern in size, simplici1y and hue.
   Contemporary moldings are less bulky and much less intricately
profiled than those of grandma's time. But the selection of designs
is as varied _ if not more so.
   ``We make more than 40 patterns of oak moldings alone,'' says
Mike Fara of House of Fara, which manufactures solid hardwood
moldings and trims. ``Almost all are between 2 and 3 inches high and
less than 1 inch in thickness. We do make larger moldings _ up to 4
and three-fourths inches with more intricate profiles, but they're
used in exceptional houses _ usually older, restored homes.''
   Natural-finished light-toned hardwoods are the biggest sellers,
outstripping by far the darker natural wppds amd somber stains. They
are often installed with a simple sealant and a clear finish, for a
light, bright look.
   Painted moldings also tend to be light in color. One stylish
technique to subtly highlight trim is to paint moldings a shade
lighter than walls: white molding on cream walls, cream with beige,
etc.
   Virtually every home or apartment has molding trim around doors
and windows, and as ``kickboards'' where walls meet floor. Changes
in style have rarely been so extreme as to eliminate these practical
conveniences.
   Crown moldings top off walls and tie them to a room's ceiling
with a flourish. The accent added to a wallpapered room in this way
helps create a warmer, cozier feeling by ``bringing down'' the
ceiling _ joining it visually more closely to the walls.
   A chair rail molding divides a room, circling it at a height of
about 32 inches, usually at the top of a wainscot panel or between
wallpapered and painted portions of a room. Chair rails are usually
thicker than other moldings, but match the crown.
   Using moldings as decorations _ as finishing touches to a room _
creates an opportunity to accent the main decor with an additional
touch of color and a distinctive visual flair.
   For a gracious traditional look, a do-it-yourselfer can create
panels of wallpaper within painted walls by setting off areas with
molding. Corners can be cut with a simple miter box and saw.
   Special effects, such as rounded or cut-out corners, can be
achieved with pre-shaped products sold in most home centers.
   There are two sources for buying moldings: lumber yards and home
centers. Lumber yards carry large pieces of unfinished, unsanded
molding (often up to 20-foot lengths) that the do-it-yourselfer can
cut to size, sand and finish. Warning: getting the longer lengths
home and up and down stairs may be the most difficult and
frustrating part of your project.
   The second source _ home centers _ stock some unfinished molding
material, but also pre-cut, pre-sanded and sealed moldings. These
are hardwood moldings cut to 6-, 7-, or 8-foot lengths, sanded and
shrink-wrapped for protection, ready for installation and finishing.
   Even for a novice do-it-yourselfer, installing molding is more a
matter of care than of craftsmanship. Measure carefully, cut
exactly. Check the setting on your adjustable miter box before each
cut. Work slowly. And, don't forget to use a level.
   Paint and wallpaper first, if your crown or chair rail molding is
new. If it isn't, paint or finish the molding first, then paint or
paper the wall up to it.
   Hardwoods can be amazingly tough to nail. If you're working with
oak trim, for instance, you'll be wise to drill nail holes in it
before installing it, to save yourself a lot of bent nails and-or
split wood.

   Polyurethanes, once considered ideal for finishing certain types
of wooden floors, have developed into versatile coatings with a much
wider range of practical uses. For one thing, they now serve equally
well as furniture finishes.
   The popularity of polyurethanes is due to several things, even
though they often cost more than most of our traditional finishes.
   They are almost impervious to household chemicals, water rings
and other stains. They are tough and resistant to scuffs, scrapes
and everyday wear and tear. And, for clinchers, they look great.
   With the introduction of satin and antique flat versions,
polyurethanes now offer do-it-yourselfers a full range of sheens.
Also, certain polyurethane formulas now contain inhibitors to
protect them from the sun's ultraviolet rays, for exterior use.
   Since the days when polyurethanes were considered an optimum
coating for bowling alleys, which endured intense wear and required
a finish with maximum impact and abrasion resistance, they have had
the reputation of being a bit difficult to handle. This was
especially so on projects requiring more than one coat.
   The technical director at United Gilsonite Laboratories, John
Molski, says the truth is that the successful application of a
polyurethane finish is quite simple. The key is in the care taken
during the preparation.
   Most often, polyurethane clear finishes are applied to bare wood
surfaces. They may also be applied to previously coated wood
surfaces, but special care must be taken.
   Existing finishes in poor condition must be stripped completely.
Lacquer or shellac finishes should also be removed because
polyurethanes do not adhere to them. Existing varnish finishes in
good condition should be thoroughly sanded to remove all gloss. In
any case, a smoothly sanded surface is essential to the success of
any wood finishing project.
   Many projects are stained to a desired color tone before final
coating with a polyurethane. Before staining, work the surface from
a medium (150) to a fine (220) grit sandpaper.
   After the stain has been applied and given sufficient drying
time, the surface can be prepared for coating with the polyurethane.
Lightly sand the stained surface with 220 sandpaper. This will allow
the polyurethane to better adhere to, or ``grip,'' the wood surface.
   After sanding is completed, vacuum or brush the surface clean,
then use a tack cloth for a final wipedown. If a tack cloth cannot
be located in stores, make one by dampening a good quality
cheesecloth in mineral spirits.
   The polyurethane can now be applied. To ensure successful
application, use at temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees
Farenheit. If using a gloss polyurethane, DO NOT STIR; the coating
is ready for application as is, Molski says. Stirring may introduce
air bubbles into the coating that will adversely affect the finish.
   Conversely, satin and flat polyurethanes contain a flattening
agent that must be gently stirred into suspension _ or, evenly
reincorporated into the mixture. (Never mix any type polyurethane
coating on a paint mixer.) Periodically, stir satin and flat
polyurethanes during use, also.
   Pour the amount of polyurethane you expect to use into a smaller
can, and reseal the original can. This keeps dust and dirt that the
brush might pick up from contaminating the remaining product, and
also minimizes skinning. Using a natural or nylon bristle brush with
a tapered edge, ``flow on'' the polyurethane evenly. For smoothest
application, hold the brush at the same angle at which the bristles
are cut.
   A foam applicator may be substituted instead of a brush,
especially if the job is small.
   Dip the brush or applicator into the can, letting the excess drip
off. Don't wipe excess off on the rim of the can. Doing so can
create air bubbles on both the can and the wood surface. Stroke as
smoothly as possible, trying to keep a wet edge so strokes blend
well.
   If the job requires more than a single coat, sand lightly in
between coats. Second and third coats tend to peel if the surface is
not broken between coats. Again, remember to properly clean the
surface after sanding.
   Polyurethane clear finishes are available in spray cans, and may
also be sprayed from standard air compressors and spray guns.
Preparation techniques remain the same as those for manual
application.
   For best results on exterior wood, choose a polyurethane
developed specifically for exterior use. It comes in both gloss and
satin types.
   Other special polyurethane formulations include quick-drying
versions. One such finish provides a medium or semigloss sheen that
dries in 2 hours and serves as a superb undercoat-sealer for open
grain woods.

   Style and practicality are two reasons often cited for building
sunspace additions to a home, but many prefer another: Let the sun
shine in.
   From solariums and greenhouses to skylights, from additions of
whole rooms to kitchen and bathroom remodeling, the common interests
are more light and more living space.
   ``The successful kitchen today is one with lots of light, a good
view, and good access,'' says Joe Esposito, executive vice president
of Four Seasons Greenhouses and Design Center, Holbrook, N.Y.
   ``People want to feel the activity going on in the rest of the
house while they're working in the kitchen,'' he says. ``Nobody who
works in a kitchen wants to feel like a servant or a cook.''
   Even in the bathroom, says Esposito, ``natural light and
expansion views give the room that pizzazz, that special touch that
is so important.''
   ``A sunspace expands a house for anything a homeowner wants, a
workplace for business or hobbies, private retreat, or entertainment
center,'' says Lee Stanley, chief designer at Solar Additions Inc.,
Greenwich, Conn., ``and helps reduce fuel bills at the same time by
capturing and trapping solar heat. The most common reason today is
to get more living space.''
   The sunspace, which attaches directly to a home, features panels
of front glass that bring solar energy inside and insulated roof and
side walls.
   Stanley says a $10,000 add-on sunspace can increase the value of
an $85,000 house to more than $100,000.
   Sunspace in the form of skylights is one recommendation if you're
considering remodeling the bathroom.
   Substituting a window with a skylight can provide a touch of
elegance as well as more space.
   Interior designer Alice Silverman, president of Creative
Interiors and Decorate-a-Day Inc., Carmel. N.Y., says a skylight in
the bathroom can have other advantages. ``Many bathroom windows are
located in the shower stall,'' she says. ``Water can collect on the
sill, rotting it and causing moisture problems behind the wall. A
skylight is a perfect solution, and it offers total privacy.''
   Most manufacturers offer three basic models of skylights, says
Alec Bechtold, vice president of the Ventarama Skylight Corp.: Fixed
(cannot open or close), venting, or motorized venting.
   Motorized models, says Bechtold, can open or close with a switch
rather than by a pole.

   A decade ago, just as the energy crisis influenced Americans to
buy smaller, more efficient cars, it also impacted the housing
market, causing developers to construct smaller, more efficient
homes.
   But today we are seeing a demand for larger, more spacious houses
with greater elegance and a more creative use of space with
sophisticated heating and ventilation systems.
   Developers have just begun to see the impact of this trend in the
demands of purchasers.
   Many house buyers, for example, want larger bedrooms that serve
as secondary living areas. And the postwar trend to reduce the
height of ceilings has been reversed. Homeowners appreciate a
minimum of 9-foot ceilings. They often soar to 20 feet, with
dramatic window treatments.
   Many homeowners will actually incorporate a mini living room into
their bedroom, where one member of the family can read quietly and
retire from the rest of the house. Comfortable lounge chairs, side
tables and small couches give bedrooms a new dimension. Some people
even opt to have fireplaces as the focus of these bedroom and living
areas.
   To complement these spacious rooms, home buyers frequently look
for large, adjacent bathrooms, often subdivided into two areas so
that more than one person can use the room at the same time.
   In the large bathrooms, homeowners may also build whirlpool baths
with separate showers and steam showers (an enclosed shower linked
to a steam generator). This provides an almost self-sufficient mini
health spa right in a bathroom.
   Previously, bathrooms were small with minimal and restrictive
light. Bathrooms are now being built with larger windows and
skylights to provide a greater feeling of openness and light. In the
same vein, enclosed sundecks are being built outside of the master
bedrooms. These extended porches show even greater popularity in the
sun belt for obvious climatological reasons.
   For the health conscious, homes will include small separate bay
areas for exercise equipment and space for calisthenics and
stretching.
   In homes at one development at Port Liberte, Jersey City, N.J.,
this bay area is located in the master bedroom, near the shower, so
that it can be used conveniently at any time. Port Liberte has a
cross section of homes ranging from $150,000 condominiums to
$900,000 family townhouses, built along a 2{-mile network of
man-made canals.
   Walk-in closets these days generally feature shelves designed for
shoes and several hanging racks for sport coats and slacks and a
variety of drawers. The closet becomes well organized, transformed
into a storage and dressing area, and very much more, with a section
that includes,large mirrors for dressing.
   Whatever market developers are dealing with, there appears to be
an increasing expectation of luxury.
   Areas for entertaining play an important role. Foyers _ large,
formal areas _ are separated from the living room and dining room,
decorated with tile and marble. This is a place to greet guests that
reflects the overall theme of a home.
   Kitchens are taking on a new flavor _ very European in style and
design. Appliances and cabinet work are getting sleaker and cleaner,
with much more sophistication in the way they operate.
   The typical American buyer will take to this with enthusiasm.
Smooth closed range tops, built-in refrigerators, built-in
microwaves, separate double ovens and a garbage disposal and
compactor will be incorporated into more and more modern kitchens.
   A wider range of counter materials will also be used, including
natural and synthetic stones, as well as tile and stainless steel.
They are durable and easy to live with, and new in appearance.
Kitchens will become an area where style is as important as design.

<BYLINE>By ANDY LANG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   It's a rare house indeed that doesn't have an extension ladder as
part of its necessary maintenance equipment.
   Whether you are painting the outside of your house, removing
leaves from the gutter, repairing a damaged roof shingle or just
trying to recover a rubber ball that has lost its way, an extension
ladder is something you need when you need it.
   Even if it is used only a couple of times a year, it justifies
its cost, which can be as little as $25 or as much as $250.
   An extension ladder is really two ladders _ fitted together so
that one can be moved upward and downward to suit your immediate
needs. Most are made of wood and metal, although there are some
light ladders other than aluminum. You should have one that you can
handle, but which suits the requirements of your house.
   Obviously, a one-story house does not need as long nor as heavy a
ladder as a two-story building. But there are other considerations,
one of the most important being who is likely to use it.
   An elderly couple who will not or cannot climb a ladder of any
size does not need an extension ladder, yet they should have one if
some other member of the family may use it. That's a personal matter
which the homeowner can pass judgment on.
   Remember that if you get a wooden ladder, it should never be
painted. The paint can hide defects already there, as well as those
that might occur at some later time. And if you get a metal ladder,
it must be handled with care to prevent it from coming into contact
with power lines.
   When you use an extension ladder, the most vital factor is
safety. You should learn how to put it up and what not to do when
you get on it.
   To be sure an extension ladder has the proper balance to keep it
from tipping when it is placed alongside your house, the feet of it
must be a certain distance away from the foundation. That distance
should be one-fourth the length of the ladder. If you have a 24-foot
ladder, for instance, its base should be 6 feet from the house
foundation when it is standing against the house.
   If you have an aluminum ladder that isn't too long and is light
enough to be handled easily, you sometimes can set it against the
house without following a set procedure.
   But most of the time, a ladder should be placed agaimst the house
in a certain fashion to prevent it from getting out of control as it
being set into position.
   The correct way is to set the base of the ladder against the
house so that it is at right angles to the foundation and the rungs
will be in the correct position when it is upright.
   Go back to the top of the ladder, grab the top rung and raise it
to the height of your shoulders. Now walk under the ladder slowly,
keeping a tight hold on it and releasing one hand at a time. Be sure
you have one hand on the ladder at all times.
   As you walk and you move your hands up the ladder, it will be
getting more and more vertical. At the same time, slowly and
carefully move the feet away from the house until it is far enough.
That point should be where you placed a marker of some kind to
indicate the exact spot.
   After everything is set and you are sure the ladder is at the
right height, the right distance from the wall and its feet are
steady, step on the first rung. Shake your body a little to test the
ladder's stability.
   Once high up on the ladder, there are certain safety precautions
that must be observed, no matter what your chores are. Always face
the ladder when climbing up or down. Hold on securely.
   Tools and supplies should be carried in your pocket if they are
small enough; otherwise they should be hauled up on a line. Paint
stores carry all kinds of equipment for anchoring tools and
equipment, stabilizing the ladder and steadying the feet of it.
   Whether painting or anything else, do not overreach. It is better
to move your ladder frequently than risk a fall.
   And be sure you know at all times where there is any electric
wiring. Do this checking before you begin working. Don't do any work
from the top rungs of the ladder.
   And forget about the ladder or whatever you planned to do if it
is a windy day.

   Do the terms involved with the remodeling of houses confuse you?
They need not, according to the Small Homes Council-Building
Research Council at the University of Illinois.
   There are six types of remodeling. The Council says they are
preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, retrofitting, conversions
and additions.
   Preservation is keeping the building in its present condition and
preventing further deterioration. Restoration refers to restoring a
house to its original character, which could mean removing so-called
improvements made in the past. Rehabilitation involves the updating
of existing features such as bathrooms and kitchens.
   Retrofitting is a term for improvements made to an existing
house, usually to make it more energy-efficient. Conversion changes
the use of existing space to fit current needs. And additions
usually involve the addition of space to the exterior of the house.
   The most expensive of those six ways of remodeling a house is
restoration, which the Council also calls the most challenging type
of remodeling. Any kind of remodeling, no matter what it is called,
is an investment of time and money.
   It can affect the value of the home and the cost to own and
operate it. But some remodeling is of dubious value from the
standpoint of financial return.
   It could decrease its value and even price it out of the
neighborhood. For instance, a house worth $100,000, remodeled to
bring it into the $150,000 to $200,000 range, might bring no offers
if priced at the latter figure.
   That's because a family wishing to spend between $150,000 and
$200,000 for a house might not want to move into an area where the
average price of the other homes is $100,000. The remodeled house
then becomes a white elephant, unable to be sold except at far less
than its value.
   A homeowner is often faced with a choice of whether to remodel or
look for another place in which to live.
   The advantages of remodeling include maintaining ties in the
neighborhood and to the schools, better financing rates at the old
percentages and avoiding the cost of selling, buying and moving. In
addition, do-it-yourself projects can be less expensive than buying
a house where the work already has been done and the costs are
included in the price.
   Disadvantages include the dirt, dust and clutter which will
disrupt family life during the project, costs which turn out to be
higher than expected, dissatisfaction with the finished job and the
aformentioned ``over-improvement.''
   One kind of home improvement that does not really increase the
value of a home, but is often desirable is that involving
maintenance. This could include such things as painting, decorating
and repairs made to offset the effects of normal wear and tear.
   Even though such maintenance does not add actual value to the
house, it often is vital, since it brings the house up to the
standard that a buyer would expect.
   Because that helps to sell a house faster and with less trouble,
it has its own special importance. There aren't many bigger
headaches to a family than having a new place to live and being
unable to get rid of the old one.
   A two-page checklist of items to be considered before remodeling
is included in the eight-page circular, ``Planning for Remodeling,''
one of a series of publications for the homeowner issued by the
Council.
   Single copies can be obtained for $1, including postage and
handling, from the Small Homes Council-Building Research Council,
University of Illinois, One East St. Mary's Road, Champaign, IL.

   While an estimated 85 percent of all do-it-yourself wallpapering
is done by women, the percentage is considerably lower when it comes
to wallpaper removal.
   Taking off the old paper and preparing the wall surface for the
new covering is the messiest part of the entire job. Martha
Washington reputedly hung the wallpaper in the first White House,
but no records exist about how the walls were prepared or if George
had a hand in it.
   The traditional method of removing wallpaper was to soak it with
warm water and scrape it off. Small sections were wet down with a
cloth or sponge and scraped while still damp. A later method of
removing papers was to apply a chemical solvent that loosened the
underlying paste. Another way was to use strippable paper that later
could be pulled off with an upward-away motion.
   Steaming remains one of the most-used methods. Though messy, it's
the most efficient method, if done properly. Non-porous paper needs
to be scored so the steam penetrates more easily. The steam machine
also makes an easier job of removing more than one layer of paper.
   On the market now is a wallpaper stripper that is sprayed on.
After 20 minutes, the paper can be peeled off, though if it's
non-porous a second application may be needed. To determine whether
or not the paper is porous, work a test patch by spraying a section
of the paper with water. The water will bead on non-porous paper.
   Non-porous papers _ the kind often found in kitchens and
bathrooms _ must be scored so enzymes in the stripper can reach and
dissolve the adhesives. This can be done with a special tool that
uses angled cutting disks to cut the paper without damaging plaster
or drywall.
   Another method is to use a variable-temperature heat gun. After
moistening a small section of the wallpaper with water, hold the gun
3 or 4 inches from the wall, starting at a seam. As the adhesive
begins to soften, loosen the paper gently with an accessory scraper
and peel it off. Take care not to overheat the paper or wall, and
don't use with flammable wallpaper removers.

   Home buyers, apparently choosing higher monthly payments and
lower interest paid over a longer term, prefer a 15-year fixed-rate
mortgage as their first mortgage option, according to a recent study.
   The consumer study, by Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate
Service, showed 40.3 percent preferred the 15-year fixed rate
mortgage, compared with 39.3 percent who would choose a 30-year
fixed-rate loan; 11 percent for adjustable rate loans, and 5 percent
for a 30-year fixed-rate bimonthly mortgage.

   A general cleanup is the home improvement that will help the most
when selling your house, according to a poll of real estate brokers.
   More than one-quarter of the brokers (27 percent) recommended
redecorating or wallpapering, followed by 21 percent who said
replacing or adding carpeting would help sell the house for the
highest possible price.
   About 400 franchise and independent real estate brokers took part
in the study conducted for ERA Real Estate, Kansas City, by
Strategic Research of St. Louis.
   Asked what major improvements provided the best long-term return
on investment when it comes time to sell, brokers listed bathroom
improvements (38 percent); kitchen remodeling (33 percent); room
additions (27 percent); heating and plumbing updating (14 percent);
energy conservation measures (11 percent); new roofing (11 percent),
and new carpeting (10 percent).

   The U.S. Department of Energy has upgraded its insulation
recommendations to home owners, increasing its minimum R-value
suggestions for the country's various climates.
   The new R-values, which measure insulation's resistance to heat
flow, are based on climate, heating and cooling needs, forms of
heating used and prices of energy.
   For example, in a gas-heated home in St. Louis, or Seattle, the
recommendation is R-38 for the attic. A similar home in Atlanta or
San Francisco carries an R-30 recommendation. In Portland, Maine, it
would be R-49.
   The new recommendations cover other areas of the home as well,
including ceilings, floors, exterior walls and crawl spaces.
   ``It's important that homeowners take the new guidelines
seriously,'' said Sen. Timothy E. Wirth, D-Colo., chairman of the
Alliance to Save Energy and member of the Senate Energy and Banking
Committee, ``because Americans spend $100 billion on household
energy, or more than $1,100 per household, annually.''
   The DOE estimates that 50 to 70 percent of the energy used in the
average American home is for heating and cooling.
   For the do-it-yourself insulation installers, Thomas Seymour, of
Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., offers this advice:
   _ First, measure the length and width of the area to be
insulated; multiply the two to get the square footage. Then,
determine how wide the insulation should be.
   _ Determine if you need a vapor barrier and what is the proper
R-value for your insulation. Higher R-value means greater insulating
power. The retailer should be able to tell you the new government
recommendations for your area.
   _ Before starting the installation, put on safety glasses, work
gloves, a long-sleeved shirt and a mask; have a sharp knife
available.

   Home improvement do-it-yourselfers need one piece of equipment
whether their projects involve replumbing the bathroom, installing
wall-to-wall carpeting or sanding doors: safety glasses.
   According to the American Optometric Association, many home
improvement projects expose the eyes to flying particles and caustic
chemicals, and culprits include sawdust, tacks, staples, metal and
wood fragments, nails, paint, varnish, turpentine and solvents.
   Yet some people never think about donning safety eyewear,
mistakenly believing their regular prescription glases or contact
lenses will protect them, says the association.
   By federal regulation, eyeglasses prescribed today are
impact-resistant but they are not safety glasses and they are no
match for pieces of wood, metal or rock thrown by power tools.
   Contact lenses are made for seeing, not protection, notes the
association adding that non-prescription safety eyewear should be
worn over them just as it should over the naked eye.
   Hardware stores usually carry inexpensive plastic safety goggles
(including types that fit over glasses), face shields and sometimes
even welding goggles and shields.
   The optometrists group advises home fixer-uppers to make sure the
safety goggles meet the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
Z87.1 standards by looking for a ``Z87'' marked on the fronts and
temples of the eyewear.
   It also suggests all do-it-yourselfers, like all adults, have
annual eye examinations because undetected vision problems may be
the cause of smashed thumbs, uneven wallpaper, measuring mistakes or
misread instructions.

   Rust and corrosion attack metal hardware and household objects
because air and moisture eventually get under their protective
films. The tiniest nick in the paint, oil, lacquer or other coating
lets air and moisture begin their attack. Rust will spread under a
paint finish and often won't be seen until it buckles the surface.
To stop its spread, the rust should be removed with sandpaper or
steel wool, then coated with a rust-proofing product available in
paint or hardware stores.

   Many householders would agree that getting rid of insects could
be included in the category of ``home improvements.''
   According to Michael Bohdan, an international pest control expert
with American Cyanamid, mild winters generally are enjoyed by the
insect world, and particularly by cockroaches.
   But Bohdan says by following a few simple rules now, many
homeowners ``can avoid an expensive and troublesome infestation
problem.''
   Among his tips for do-it-yourself home extermination is the
suggestion to keep windows and doorways screened and well-sealed,
and to repair cracks and holes in walls.
   Other recommendations include:
   _ Keep sinks in bathroom and kitchen dry and drains clean. Hang
up mops and brooms, and use a dehumidifier if possible in unusually
moist rooms.
   _ Repair leaky faucets and drain pipes immediately.
   _ Don't save extra paper bags, newspapers or boxes.
   _ Empty garbage daily and don't let empty bottles pile up.
   _ Store loose food (including pet food) in airtight, plastic
containers.
   _ Don't store firewood indoors or next to the house.
   _ Feed pets during the day and clean pet dishes at night.
   _ Don't leave dirty dishes out overnight.
   _ Keep the area next to the house clear of leaves and organic
debris. Also clean gutters and outside drains.

jetliners and placed options for four more, Boeing Commercial
Airplanes said.
   The Montreal-based carrier ordered ``combi'' versions of the
aircraft. The combis can be arranged to carry additional cargo on
the passenger deck.
   A Boeing spokesman did not have an exact figure for the value of
the orders, but said Friday each 747-400 generally sells for $110
million to $129 million.

   The dollar closed slightly higher against the
Japanese yen today, while share prices rebounded on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which shed 141.02 points
Friday, climbed 162.50 points, or 0.52 percent, closing at
31,332.88. The index, which gained 94.95 points shortly after the
market opened, rose steadily throughout the day. It had closed at
31,170.38 Friday.
   The gain in Tokyo followed a similar trend on overseas markets,
dealers said.
   A Daiwa Securities dealer said investors started buying shares as
fluctuations in the dollar-yen exchange rate stablized.
   ``Investors are still concerned about how oil prices will move on
overseas markets, but stabilization in the foreign exchange trading
boosted buying today,'' said the dealer, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Steels and shipbuilding issues attracted buyers today.
   Trading on the first section volume reached an estimated 1
billion shares.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 128.20 yen,
up 0.15 yen from Friday's 128.05 yen finish.
   The dollar opened lower at 127.73 yen following its overnight
decline on overseas markets, where investors sold back dollars
bought last weekend ahead of President Bush's inaugural speech
Friday, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   He said today's trading was quiet in Tokyo, where the dollar
ranged between 127.70 yen and 128.25 yen.
   Another dealer with a commercial bank in Tokyo, also speaking
anonymously, said investors were waiting on the sidelines after the
inaugural address, waiting to see what Bush would do to reduce the
U.S. trade deficit.
   Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan governor, Satoshi Sumita, said today
the dollar's recent strength was unlikely to continue. He said the
central bank would take appropriate measures against excessive
fluctuations.
   Sumita said that a rising trend in U.S. interest rates and crude
oil prices was largely responsible for the dollar's firmness.

<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall
temporarily blocked the second stock-manipultion trial of GAF Corp.
and a senior executive after the defendants argued their rights
would be violated with new court proceedings.
   The ruling late Sunday came just two days before opening
arguments were scheduled to begin in the jury trial. Marshall gave
prosecutors until 11 a.m. EST Wednesday to file a response to the
stay.
   GAF and Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin were indicted in July on
charges they sought to artificially inflate the price of Union
Carbide Corp. stock in late 1986 after a failed attempt to take the
company over. The alleged motive was to heighten GAF's gain from the
planned sale of its Union Carbide stock.
   The defendants denied the charges in what became the first case
to reach trial following a major crackdown on Wall Street corruption
by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.
   Their first trial ended Jan. 10 in a mistrial after U.S. District
Judge Mary Johnson Lowe ruled in Manhattan that federal prosecutors
improperly withheld information about a key piece of evidence from
the defense.
   Defense attorneys have argued that a second trial would violate
their rights against double jeopardy, the law that a defendant can't
be tried twice on the same charge.
   Much of the evidence in the GAF case had been provided by Boyd T.
Jefferies, a Los Angeles securities broker who said his firm was
retained by Sherwin to handle the alleged manipulative trades in
Union Carbide stock.
   Jefferies, an admitted felon who has cooperated with the
government in at least three securities-fraud prosecutions, was
implicated by Ivan F. Boesky, the now-imprisoned inside trader
exposed in late 1986.

<TEXT>
   When it comes to innovation in marketing
and product development, the Campbell Soup Co. lives up to its
slogan ``Mm! Mm! Good,'' according to a survey of senior corporate
executives who said too many other American corporations lack
imagination.
   In its fourth annual ``Innovation Survey,'' Norwalk-based Group
EFO Ltd. found that 34 percent of those responding rated Campbell
the most innovative corporation in America, followed by Pillsbury,
Proctor &amp; Gamble, Hormel and General Foods.
   ``Campbell has gone against the tide in a lot of ways,'' Edward
F. Ogiba, president of Group EFO, a consulting firm that specializes
in consumer attitudes toward new products, said Friday.
   ``They are a big company that is acting like a small company,''
he said. ``They've been willing to take risks and they've been
willing to look at quite a wide variety of offerings to find out
what the consumer really wants to get a new product.''
   The survey, released last week, was based on responses from 75
chief executives, corporate presidents and directors of marketing
and planning and development at some of the world's largest consumer
package good companies, Ogiba said. It was co-sponsored by the Food
&amp; Beverage Marketing magazine.
   Ogida noted that Camden, N.J.-based Campbell has introduced a
string of hugely successful new product lines over the last several
years, including the upscale ``Le Menu'' frozen dinners, Prego
spaghetti sauce, Pepperidge Farm American Collection cookies and
Campbell's Home Cookin' soups.
   The survey found what Ogiba called an alarming lack of confidence
in the way new products are developed.
   Eighty percent of those responding predicted that 83 percent of
all new products introduced this year will fail and that 33 percent
felt consumer research was unreliable.
   Sixty-two percent believe that products introduced this year will
prove the same or less innovative than last year. Fifty-five percent
felt product development lacked direction.
   Ogiba said his survey indicated that marketing executives have
become mesmerized by the idea of convenience _ foods that can be
stored easily or quickly prepared _ as the key selling point in
developing new product lines or in coming out with new versions of
products already have on the market.
   Companies like Campbell, on the other hand, have gone to great
lengths to explore other characteristics that will appeal to
consumers, Ogiba said.
   ``They are not bashful about looking at alternatives,'' he said.
   Many companies tend to run in packs, Ogiba said.
   After reports that calcium supplments could help combat the bone
disease osteoporis, for example, 50 new calcium-enriched foods and
beverages were introduced in the United States during a 13-week
period in 1986, Ogiba said.
   Despite initial consumer research that such products would sell,
most are no longer on the market, he said.
   ``This survey was the first to pinpoint that the new product
process itself may be a key reason for the high failure rate,'' he
said. ``According to the respondents, most new product development
processes today lack strategic imagination and creative focus.
Almost every U.S. marketer is exploring the same opportunities.''
   Herbert M. Baum, president of Campbell U.S.A., Campbell's
domestic divsion, attributed part of the company's success to the
fact that Campbell executives don't rely too heavily on traditional
consumer research.
   The company does a lot of research that isn't geared to a
particular product and instead tries to track consumer trends, he
said.
   ``One of the things we try to do is stay very close to consumers
and that means from the senior management of the company on down,''
Baum said.
   Fifty-one percent of those surveyed named Japan as the most
innovative country in the world, followed by the United States, West
Germany and the United Kingdom.

<HEAD>Pressure Mounts For Independent Inquiry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Socialist government is coming under increasing
pressure to allow an independent inquiry into a blossoming insider
trading scandal involving one of President Francois Mitterrand's
closest friends.
   Both Communist leader Andre Lajoinie and a prominent
conservative, Michel Noir, appealed Sunday for a parliamentary
investigation of suspicious trading in shares of the U.S. firm
Triangle Industries Inc. last fall just before it was acquired by
Pechiney SA, a French government-owned aluminum manufacturer.
   Officials at the presidential Elysee Palace are insisting they
will leave the investigation to the Commission des Operations de
Bourse, the French stock exchange watchdog body.
   ``Can the Elysee, which has preferred so far to defer to the COB
investigation and the slow process of the justice system, still
shelter behind this line of defense?'' the financial daily Les Echos
asked Monday in an editorial.
   The uproar led to the resignation Friday of Alain Boublil, the
top aide to Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy. Boublil then filed
libel suits against two magazines and a newspaper which reported
suspicions that he had leaked vital information about the Triangle
takeover.
   A key figure is 70-year-old retired businessman Roger-Patrice
Pelat, who met Mitterrand in a German prisoner-of-war camp, worked
with him in the French Resistance and has been a frequent companion
of the president on his afternoon strolls through the streets of
Paris.
   Pelat was among the investors who made quick profits by buying
Triangle stock when it was trading at about $10 per share, then
selling it a few days later after Pechiney's Nov. 21 takeover bid of
$56 per share.
   The daily Le Monde reported Saturday that a secret report to
Mitterrand revealed that Pelat or his son may have bought 40,000
shares through a bank in Switzerland and a broker in Luxembourg, in
addition to the 10,000 shares he was already known to have purchased
through a French bank.
   Mitterrand's aides refused to confirm or deny the account. Pelat
has been unavailable for comment.
   According to reports in several French newspapers, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission told its French counterpart that
it was investigating purchases in the days before the takeover of
about 220,000 Triangle shares, which usually only changed hands at
the rate of a few thousand each day.
   Much of the stock was bought through Swiss banks which have
declined to identify their clients.
   Max Theret, a businessman with close ties to the governing
Socialists, has acknowledged buying 32,300 shares but said he made a
smart choice of stock without any inside information. Theret told
reporters he was the one who tipped Pelat that Triangle would be a
good buy.
   Besides Boublil, many other government officials were privy to
the Pechiney deal, which had to have Finance Ministry approval in
advance. But it has not become clear how the information may have
been leaked to buyers.
   The Commission des Operations de Bourse issued a statement
denying that it was the source of the report in Le Monde's article.
   The commission says it expects to finish its investigation by the
end of the month. If it finds enough evidence, it can do no more
than transmit the file to prosecutors for them to pursue the case.
   Successful prosecutions have been rare in French stock market
cases, and even more unusual in French political scandals, which
often blaze through the headlines for several weeks then fade away
unresolved.
   The leftist newspaper Liberation, generally sympathetic to the
Socialist government, noted in an editorial Monday that the
involvement of the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission made it
less likely that the affair will be covered up.
   ``It is true also that an inquiry leading to the punishment of
guilt and complicity according to the law remains the only salvation
for the shaken authorities,'' the newspaper wrote. ``This would be
unprecedented in the history of French scandals, and it would not
mean that weeks of rampant suspicion would not leave scars.''

   The stock market headed higher today, resuming
its early-1989 rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.32 to 2,242.68 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 579 up, 311 down and
518 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.75 million shares as of 10

   Analysts said traders had been responding favorably to generally
strong fourth-quarter earnings reports.
   They also said money managers at investing institutions continued
to put some of their large cash reserves into the market.
   In recent weeks, brokers report, many professional investors have
begun to worry less about a possible replay of the October 1987
crash, and more about the prospect of missing out on a significant
market advance.
   Some forecasters have talked lately about the chances of an
especially strong market should interest rates take a downward turn.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Ford Motor rose ] to 52~; Exxon
[ to 45[; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph [ to 29|, and Union Carbide
| to 28[.
   Union Carbide reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.59 a share,
up from 17 cents in the comparable period a year earlier.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.42 to 161.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .09 at 319.43.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 3.75 to
2,235.36, closing out the week with a net gain of 9.29 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 6 on the

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Monsanto Co. reported Monday that its
fourth-quarter earnings were flat but its profit for all of 1988
reached the highest level in the company's history.
   Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled $45
million, or 70 cents a share, compared with earnings of $44 million,
or 62 cents a share, in 1987. Sales rose slightly to $1.88 billion
from $1.85 billion.
   For the year, Monsanto's income jumped 36 percent to a record
$591 million, or $8.27 per share, from $436 million, or $5.63 a
share, in 1987. Annual sales reached $8.29 billion, vs. $7.64
billion.
   ``Monsanto had an outstanding year in 1988 and the company is in
position to continue to advance in 1989 and beyond,'' Chairman
Richard J. Mahoney said in a statement. ``... We're encouraged by
the progress made so far toward our strategic objectives.''
   Monsanto said the company's agricultural unit was a major
contributor to last year's strong performance despite the severe
summer drought. Sales were particularly strong for Monsanto's
Roundup and Lasso herbicide products and Alimet animal feed
supplement.
   Profits from the artificial sweetener NutraSweet also improved
due largely to increased consumer demand and manufacturing cost
improvements.
   Monsanto's chemicals, plastics and fibers units did well for the
year but fell short for the quarter, largely because the previous
year included $14 million of restructuring income.
   Mahoney said operating losses for the year at G.D. Searle and Co.
were cut by nearly half from a year ago.

<HEAD>Justices Reject Bid to Protect Longshoremen's Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an effort to
preserve longshoremen's jobs in the face of changing technology.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that labor
agreements between the International Longshoremen's Association and
shipping companies softening the impact of ``containerization'' at
Gulf and Atlantic coast ports violate federal shipping law.
   The dispute six times has idled most of the nation's ports.
   In 1985, the justices provided a big victory for longshoremen by
ruling that the agreements are legal under federal labor law.
   But the Federal Maritime Commission, upheld by a federal appeals
court here last Aug. 9, ruled that the agreements cannot withstand a
shipping-law challenge.
   Lawyers for the longshoremen's union said that if its appeal
failed ``the labor strife which beset the industry for more than two
decades is bound to resume.''
   At issue were labor responsibilities in the loading and unloading
of large metal cargo containers, used as efficiency improvements
over the piece-by-piece loading of ocean-borne cargo traditionally
performed by longshoremen.
   The containers, some weighing more than 30,000 pounds, can be
mechanically loaded onto or unloaded from a ship without a single
package being handled by an ILA member.
   The huge metal containers, introduced in the late 1950s, are
removed from ships, hitched to trucks and driven to their final
destination or to off-pier terminals where they are unloaded.
   Use of containers gave rise to new cargo-handling businesses, the
so-called non-vessel operating common carriers.
   Also called consolidators, these businesses offer container
services to shippers with less than a containerload of goods to
transport. Consolidators offer loading and unloading services at
their own off-pier locations, or by contract with independent
warehousemen or trucking companies.
   Under the disputed collective-bargaining agreements, longshoremen
are guaranteed the right to load and unload the contents of most
containers that come from consolidators located within 50 miles of a
port.
   The agreements, most of them dating back to 1968, meant that
about 20 percent of the cargo arriving at ports in containers was
loaded and unloaded by longshoremen _ adding to transportation costs.
   About 80 percent of the cargo shipped in containers passes
through a port intact.
   The maritime commission ruled that the agreements, and their
effect on shipping rates, violated federal shipping laws. The U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld the ruling, but postponed the
effect of its ruling so the ILA could seek Supreme Court review.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the longshoremen's
union said, ``This case presents substantial questions as to whether
work preservation is a right which the shipping laws must
accommodate.''
   Justice Department lawyers, representing the maritime commission,
urged the high court to reject the appeal.
   ``The commission need not condone violations of (shipping laws)
merely because federal labor law sanctions the underlying conduct,''
the government argued.
   The case is ILA vs. Federal Maritime Commission, 88-756.

<TEXT>
   Continental Health Affiliates Inc.
has withdrawn its $7-a-share, $105 million offer for Healthdyne Inc.
but says it has increased its stake in the medical services company.
   Continental, of Englewood Cliffs, said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that it still is interested in
purchasing the Marietta, Ga.-based company. But recent Healthdyne
stock performance and corporate moves have forced a re-evaluation of
Continental's bid, according to a report in Monday's editions of The
Wall Street Journal.
   ``Disappointing results of operations, the unwillingness of its
directors to agree to any transaction with Continental Health, the
uncertainties created by Healthdyne's announcement to spin off one
or more aspects of its business and the significant decline in the
market price of its common stock in November and December'' were
cited by Continental last Friday as reasons for withdrawing its
original bid.
   The company also announced it has bought 79,000 additional shares
of Healthdyne stock, increasing its stake in the company to about
1.1 million shares or 7.4 percent of the total 14.8 million shares
outstanding.

<HEAD>Atlanta-Based Pest Control Company Must Rescind Increases Nationwide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear an
appeal by a pest control company ordered to roll back a fee increase
it charged to more than 200,000 customers nationwide.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that Orkin
Exterminating Co. acted in good faith in hiking renewal fees to
produce more than $7.5 million in extra revenue.
   Orkin, based in Atlanta, began in 1966 to offer what it called
lifetime guarantees of continued protection for buildings treated
for termite infestation.
   The company specified in its consumer contracts that it would
annually reinspect and treat for termites without raising the yearly
fee.
   The company abandoned the policy in 1975, no longer promising the
fixed annual fee.
   But it still had more than 200,000 customers who signed the
pre-1975 contracts and believed they were entitled to continued
protection without increases.
   Orkin in 1980 began notifying those customers that it would
increase the annual renewal fees at least $25 and, in some cases, up
to 40 percent.
   The company, facing sharply higher costs for insecticides, said
it acted in good faith on the advice of its lawyers, who said the
increases were legal.
   The company in 1984 rolled back the increases on its own for some
21,500 customers who may have signed up for the service after seeing
advertisements promising that the yearly fee never would increase.
   The Federal Trade Commission in May 1984 took action against
Orkin, accusing the company of an unfair trade practice in raising
the fees for all those who held pre-1975 contracts.
   The government said that while increased fees to individuals
might involve relatively small amounts of money, Orkin received
increased revenue exceeding $7.5 million.
   The FTC ordered a rollback in the fees for all those holding the
pre-1975 contracts, and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last
July upheld the commission's order.
   The appeals court said the fact that Orkin relied upon the advice
of its lawyers to hike the fees is irrelevant.
   The FTC's fairness rules focus on consumer injury, not ``the
mental state of the party accused of a violation,'' the appeals
court said.
   The case is Orkin vs. FTC, 88-710.

<HEAD>Alabama Man Wins Insurance Damages Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a $1.25
million punitive-damages award won against an insurance company by
an Alabama man suffering from cataracts in both eyes.
   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by Nationwide
Mutual Insurance Co.
   The court already has under study the issue of skyrocketing
awards in personal-injury lawsuits. But the justices acted on the
Nationwide case before issuing any decision in that case.
   In the case acted on today, the Alabama Supreme Court upheld a
$1.25 million jury award against Nationwide won by Henry Gerrard
Clay of Mobile.
   Clay accused Nationwide of dealing in bad faith by refusing to
pay his disability claim for $46,000.
   Clay, a lawyer, purchased the disability policy with Nationwide
in 1976. The following year he was diagnosed as having cataracts in
both eyes. He closed his law office and filed the claim with
Nationwide.
   At various times, Nationwide refused to pay the full amount on
the policy because it said the cataracts existed prior to Clay's
purchase of the policy, that Clay had misstated his income and that
he was not disabled.
   During one period, the company paid Clay $1,300 a month for four
months while warning him that if he stopped paying his premiums he
would not be entitled to any further payments on his claim.
   An attorney for Nationwide warned Clay at one point about suing
the company by stating, ``Go ahead, but you won't receive one nickel
for 10 years.''
   The Alabama Supreme Court rejected arguments by Nationwide that
the jury never should have been allowed to consider whether the
company dealt in bad faith.
   ``The record is replete with examples of Nationwide's intentional
failure to investigate Clay's claim,'' the state court said. A claim
of bad faith is ``recognized to deal with just this type of
situation.''
   The state court also said Nationwide failed at the trial to raise
its argument that the damage award was unconstitutionally excessive,
barring that issue being raised on appeal.
   But in any case, the state court rejected the argument that
``punitive damages should bear some particular mathematical
relationship to compensatory damages'' in personal-injury suits.
   Nationwide also challenged the Alabama Supreme Court's authority
to rule on the punitive-damages issue, arguing that the state
court's impartiality was compromised by a prior case involving a
conflict of interest by a former justice of that court.
   In 1986, the nation's highest court said then-Alabama Supreme
Court Justice T. Eric Embry should have disqualified himself from
ruling in a similar case because Embry had a personal stake in the
outcome.
   Embry had sued two insurance companies himself, accusing them of
bad faith in refusing to pay insurance claims.
   Nationwide said that even though Embry took no part in the Clay
ruling, other members of the Alabama Supreme Court also should have
disqualified themselves because their ``perceptions were forged'' in
the earlier case in which Embry participated.
   The case is Nationwide vs. Clay, 88-157.

   The stock market declined slightly today after an
early advance faded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 8 points in the
early going, was down 3.75 at 2,231.61 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 491 up, 623 down and
604 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 52.72 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said traders had been responding favorably to generally
strong fourth-quarter earnings reports.
   They also said money managers at investing institutions continued
to put some of their large cash reserves into the market.
   But the market also was faced with selling by traders eager to
cash in on the gains in stock prices since late last year.
   The rally showed signs of bogging down last week when the Dow
Jones industrial average approached 2,247 _ the level where it stood
just before it took a 508-point drop on Black Monday Oct. 19, 1987.
   Union Carbide rose [ to 27| in active trading. The company
reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.59 a share, up from 17 cents
in the comparable period a year earlier.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.19 to 160.97. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .58 at 318.94.

   The Supreme Court today refused to let a
financially troubled utility company increase electric rates to help
pay for a controversial nuclear power plant in Seabrook, N.H.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``properly presented federal
question,'' left intact a New Hampshire law barring rate increases
to pay for power plant construction before the facilities are
completed and placed in service.
   Though completed two years ago, the Seabrook plant has not yet
received a federal license to operate.
   The New Hampshire Supreme Court last year upheld the state law
denying higher rates to the Public Service Co. of New Hampshire,
which owns 35 percent of the Seabrook plant through a subsidiary.
The state court said the utility was not entitled to ``a bailout.''
   Other utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont and New
Hamshpire also are owners of the Seabrook plant.
   Public Service of New Hampshire spent more than $1.77 billion to
build the plant, and the total project cost has been increasing at
the rate of $50 milllion a month since completed in late 1986.
   The utility filed for bankruptcy last January, seeking court
protection from its creditors. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
thus far has refused to license Seabrook to operate because the
plant lacks an approved evacuation plan.
   In a decision raising related issues, the Supreme Court on Jan.
11 said states have sweeping power to protect consumers by barring
utilities from charging customers for the costs of abandoned nuclear
power plants that were never operated.
   The high court barred two Pennsylvania utilities from recovering
from their customers the costs of four abandoned power plants. The
utilities contended their property, in effect, had been taken
without the constitutionally required just compensation.
   In contrast to the Seabrook owners, the Pennsylvania utilities
were solidly profitable and in no danger of going bankrupt.
   In addition to New Hampshire, 11 states forbid utilities from
charging customers for assets that have not been placed in service,
according to the National Association of Regulatory Utility
Commissioners _ Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa,
Massachusetts, Missouri, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota and
Washington state. Pennsylvania's law now permits recovery in some
circumstances, said Charles Gray, assistant general counsel of the
association.
   In the New Hamphire case, Public Service asked for an emergency
rate increase of nearly $71 million a year in 1987 plus other
financial help.
   The state Supreme Court upheld a New Hampshire law that says,
``At no time shall any (utility) rates or charges be based upon any
costs associated with construction work if said construction work is
not completed.''
   The state court said the law properly places the risk of building
nuclear plants with investors rather that consumers.
   ``The company is asking to shift the risk back to the
ratepayer,'' the state court said. ``The company and its investors
have received compensation for the risks they have assumed through
an enhanced rate of return and here seek relief from those risks now
that they have come to pass. Essentially, the company seeks a
bailout.''
   ``The state and federal constitutions do not allow the company to
have it both ways,'' the state court said.
   The creditors of Public Service joined the utility in urging the
justices to overturn the state court ruling.
   State officials were supported by New Hampshire's Consumer
Advocate Office in defending the state court decision.
   The state's consumer advocate said, ``How can (the utility and
its creditors) expect a state with less than one million people to
pay the over $2 billion invested in Seabrook, and to also bear the
cost of power that will have to be purchased to replace that which
was to be supplied by Seabrook?''
   The consumer advocate said investors would be able to recover
their investment through higher electric rates if Seabrook is able
to operate and provide power.
   The Seabrook plant has had a troubled history. Besides delays and
mounting costs, it has encountered criticism from environmentalists
and anti-nuclear activists. Opposition from the state of
Massachusetts has stymied development of the evacuation plan for the
zone within 10 miles of the plant, a zone that includes several
Massachusetts communities.
   The case is Public Service Co. vs. New Hampshire, 87-1613.

<TEXT>
   Wheat and soybean futures prices opened higher
while corn futures were mixed in early trading today at the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   The markets have been oversold in recent trading sessions, and
today's gains reflected mostly ``a technical bounce following big
losses,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Heavy weekend rains in Brazil helped improve the soybean crops
there and added a negative tone to soybean trading, while buying was
sparked in the wheat pit by reports that the Soviet Union is bidding
on 660,000 tons of U.S. export bonus wheat, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.47 a bushel; corn was \ cent
lower to 1} cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at
$2.69{ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 2 cents higher with March at
$2.36 a bushel; and soybeans were unchanged to 4 cents higher with
the March contract at $7.54{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures prices retreated at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   In early trading, live cattle were .18 cent to .55 cent lower,
with the February contract at 72.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were .10 cent to .55 cent lower with the contract for delivery in
January at 83.60 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .60 cent lower
with February at 43.35 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were

cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed in trading Friday.

   The owner of Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and
Biscuits said Monday it has reached a ``standstill'' agreement with
Church's Fried Chicken Inc. under which Popeyes may examine the
financial records of the competitor it is trying to buy.
   In return for the confidential information, A. Copeland
Enterprises Inc. said it agreed not to purchase any stock in
Church's for a year except under a $292 million tender offer for the
company.
   Popeyes, which is offering to buy Church's for $8 a share,
reportedly is concerned that Church's books will show its offer is
too high. That could hamper financing arrangements for any deal.
   Church's, the nation's second-largest fried chicken restaurant
chain, has entered into similar standstill agreements with other
companies. Church's said it began talking with third parties about a
possible purchase of the firm after Popeyes announced its offer.
   Under the agreement with Church's, Popeyes said it would not
begin its tender offer until Feb. 19, the deadline Church's has set
for buyout bids.
   That is the same day a federal judge in San Antonio has said he
would probably rule on the validity of Church's ``poison pill''
defense against hostile takeovers.
   The pill allows Church's shareholders to buy additional stock in
the company at a steep discount. With many more shares to be bought,
the price of a hostile takeover would soar.
   Popeyes says it owns or has been tendered 45 percent of Church's
nearly 37 million outstanding shares.

<HEAD>EEC Ministers Approve Retaliatory Measures in Imports Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European foreign ministers today agreed
to impose stiff duties on some U.S. imports but delayed implementing
the sanctions to give both sides time to resolve a trans-Atlantic
trade dispute.
   Spainish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez warned that
the 12-nation European Economic Community will levy the tariffs if
there is no move to ease the conflict by mid-February.
   ``We hope the new North American administration will adopt a more
intelligent attitude,'' Fernandez Ordonez said.
   American officials said they were pleased with the delay by the
trading bloc, known as the Common Market.
   ``We want to make every effort to first contain and then resolve
this dispute, and this decision ... is clearly a positive step in
that direction,'' the U.S. Mission to the community said in a
statement.
   But the statement also said officials were ``very concerned''
about the ministers' decision to approve a list of products that
``could eventually be the target of ... counter-retaliation.''
   The dispute was touched off by the EEC's decision to impose a
Jan. 1 ban on U.S. meat from cattle treated with growth hormones.
The United States retaliated with higher tariffs on a variety of
products from the trading bloc.
   Representatives of the European nations earlier this month agreed
on a series of counter-measures to boost duties to 100 percent on
U.S. imports of unshelled walnuts and dried fruit, including
apricots, peaches, prunes, apples and pears. Each round of tariffs
affects about $100 million in trade.
   The European Commission, the trading group's executive body,
asked the ministers to impose the retaliatory tariffs on Feb. 1.
   But Fernandez Ordonez said the ministers decided against setting
a date so as ``not to diminish room for maneuvering we have with the
new administration'' of President George Bush.
   The ministers said in a statement they ``will take stock of the
situation'' at their Feb. 20 meeting.
   ``The counter-measures will be put into effect unless there is
satisfactory process in (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)
or in bilateral negotiations with the United States,'' the statement
said.
   The community will ask the 96-nation GATT at a Feb. 8 meeting to
declare the U.S. retaliatory duties in violation of the
international body's rules.
   By delaying implementation of its own retaliatory measures, the
EEC will ease, at least temporarily, tensions surrounding the
conflict, which stems from the Common Market's decision to ban for
health reasons meat from animals treated with growth hormones.
   U.S. officials maintain that the use of certain hormones to
fatten animals, a common practice among American farmers, does not
pose a health risk.

<HEAD>National Wheatgrowers Official Fears Another Season Of Drought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENOA, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new president of the National
Wheatgrowers Association expects another season of drought,
predicting it could ruin some farmers who survived last year's lack
of moisture.
   Reggie Wyckoff of Genoa, a third-generation Colorado farmer who
operates a 6,000-acre farm homesteaded by his grandfather, became
president of the 60,000-member wheatgrowers group last week and
immediately made some pessimistic observations.
   ``Everywhere I've been this fall and winter except in
(southeastern) Washington state, everybody is dry,'' said Wyckoff.
His organization, active in 18 states, represents farmers producing
85 percent of the nation's wheat.
   ``I was in Montana in December, and there was absolutely no snow,
50-degree weather, and they have no reserve moisture in their soil
at all,'' he said. ``Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota are all
dry, and they'll need a lot of moisture to make a good crop.''
   Wyckoff said the winter wheat crop now in the ground is fairly
resilient and still can be saved with timely spring rains and snows.
   Noting that last year's small wheat crop and export demand cut
surplus wheat from 2 billion bushels to 530 million bushels, Wyckoff
said, ``If we had another short crop this year, it could mean some
tremendously high prices for farmers. But what good is that if you
don't have anything to sell?''
   He said even Colorado, which dodged the drought and produced good
crops last year, is far drier this winter on the plains.
   ``If you measure precipitation in October and November compared
to previous years, it's the second-driest in 81 years,'' said Wayne
Shawcroft, a Colorado State University scientist at the Agricultural
Research Station in Akron.
   ``If you measure the last four months of 1988, it's the 10th
driest in 81 years,'' Shawcroft said.
   Mike Gillespie, snow survey supervisor for the U.S. Soil
Conservation Service, said snowpack in the Colorado mountains was 94
percent of normal on Jan. 1. While the snowpack is comforting to
farmers who work Colorado's 900,000 irrigated acres of corn and
wheat, it provides little solace to farmers who grow wheat on 2.3
million acres of non-irrigated land on the eastern plains.
   ``Precipitation on the plains in the Arkansas River Basin has
been only 65 percent of average, and in the South Platte Basin, it's
been only 68 percent of average, so the plains have been dry since
the first of October,'' said Gillespie.
   He said Idaho, Wyoming, Montana and Utah are having another in a
series of ``very dry winters'' with snowpack ranging from 80 percent
to 96 percent of normal.
   ``We're not doing real well in those areas. They could use
above-average snowpacks just to make up the deficits they've had in
their storage reservoirs,'' said Gillespie.

<HEAD>Rig Count Drops by 51, Totals 789</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the fourth week in a row, the number of
working oil and natural gas rigs has taken a plunge, this week by 51
to total 789, industry watcher Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   For the past three weeks the count has dropped twice by 32 and
once by 36, following a two-week increase of 25 rigs. Last week the
rig count totaled 840. A year ago, the number of rigs totaled 1,026,
Baker Hughes said Monday.
   The decline follows normal seasonal patterns, according to Baker
Hughes economist Ike Kerridge.
   ``I hoping it would taper off by now,'' Kerridge said. ``I have
no particular explanation for it. I have not heard of any weather
conditions being a problem.''
   The count usually drops off during late December through late
March or early April, he said. ``It doesn't always follow that
pattern. We'll just have to wait and see.''
   The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of
last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   The lowest level last year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, only two saw an increase in rig
activity _ Ohio by five and Pennsylvania by four. Michigan and
Wyoming saw no change from last week.
   Louisiana saw the steepest decline with 18 fewer rigs, followed
by Oklahoma, 12; New Mexico, 10; Texas, seven; California and
Kansas, four each; Colorado, two; and North Dakota, one.

   Setting aside their rivalry, Du Pont Co. and the

   Approved garments will carry a blue-and-brown label with the tag

Pont's brand name for spandex stretch fabric.
   The main uses for cotton-Lycra blends are women's panties and
men's and women's sportswear. Du Pont and Cotton Inc. also plan to
develop new fabrics, such as a corduroy that contains Lycra, the
organizations said.
   ``Du Pont and Cotton Inc. will remain competitors in many areas.
But after 20-odd years or so of being competitors we have found a
common area of agreement,'' said Bill Daddi, a spokesman for Cotton
Inc., which represents U.S. cotton growers.
   Daddi said Cotton Inc. won't give its seal of approval to all
cotton-Lycra blends. It still believes denim should be all cotton.

   Fairchild Industries Inc., which last week
rejected an unsolicited takeover bid from the Carlyle Group, said
Monday it had adopted a plan to protect stockholders in case of
unfriendly takeover bids.
   Fairchild, a defense electronics contractor, said its
shareholders would receive rights entitling them to buy more stock
in Fairchild at a discount in certain cases where a hostile bidder
acquired 20 percent or more of Fairchild's common shares.
   The rights, approved Saturday by the board of directors, would
also entitle Fairchild shareholders to buy stock in the buyer at a
discount if the buyer managed to acquire Fairchild.
   The Carlyle Group, a Washington, D.C.-based investment
partnership that offered $264 million for Fairchild, had said last
week it would review its options after Fairchild rejected its offer.
Stephen Norris, a Carlyle managing director, was said to be in a
meeting Monday and not available for comment on the anti-takeover
measures.
   Fairchild spokeswoman Deborah M. Tucker said the rights plan was
not solely a response to the Carlyle offer.
   Fairchild said four existing shareholders that operate as a group
would be able to raise their combined ownership to 24.99 percent of
voting stock without triggering the rights. The four, George Soros,
Harvey L. Karp, Quantum Fund NV and Bozsi Limited Partnership, were
covered by a previous agreement that limited their ownership to 25
percent of the voting stock.
   The rights, which will be issued as special dividends, are
intended to protect shareholders against a purchase at an inadequate
price; partial or two-tier takeover attempts; coercive stock
accumulation programs, and other tactics designed to gain control of
the company without offering what Fairchild called ``an adequate
price to all stockholders,'' according to the company.
   The distribution of rights will be made to common stockholders of
record on Feb. 2, and shares of common stock that are newly-issued
after that date will also carry rights, the company said. The rights
will expire in 10 years, and Fairchild may redeem them for 1 cent
each at anytime before a buyer acquires a 20 percent position in the
company, and under certain other circumstances.

<TEXT>
   When presidential campaigner George Bush said
that if elected he wouldn't raise taxes his sincerity was
questioned. When nominee Bush said it again the doubts grew. They
continue under President Bush.
   The doubts are expressed by wage-earners who may have grown a bit
cynical, by the media, by corporate executives with a smattering of
economic theory, by economists who argue that it is simply illogical
not to seize the opportunity.
   Rarely has there been such a consensus that higher taxes are the
way to solve the budget deficit, the trade deficit, the plight of
the homeless, the nation's health problems and almost any other
social or economic need.
   And seldom has a president so blithely dismissed the pressure.
   The widespread view that taxes are the way to go illustrates how
tenacious a hold the tax-and-spend mentality has on people who, you
may have heard, began their new country with a dedication to
restrained government and taxes.
   Is the new president naive? You judge.
   Under the budget projections submitted by Ronald Reagan, who
fought but probably didn't succeed in keeping taxes down, individual
income tax receipts and social insurance tax receipts are projected
to rise 9 percent in 1990.
   That 9 percent revenue increase would follow a 7 percent increase
in 1989 and a 6 percent increase in 1988. Receipts go up even when
rates don't because of the expansion of the economy.
   Individual income taxes plus social insurance taxes and
contributions are projected to equal 16.1 percent of gross national
product by 1993.
   Except for wartime or recession, 16 percent is an exceptional
number. In 1988, the percentages was 15.4; in 1975, it was only
13.5. And if you go back to the pre-World War II period it would, of
course, be in single numbers.
   Without help from increases, individual income taxes as a percent
of gross national product will amount to 8.9 percent, compared with
just 8 percent in 1975. Social insurance taxes will be 7.2 percent,
against 5.5 percent in 1975.
   After compiling and analyzing these figures, John Wright,
chairman of Wright Investors' Service and a noted economic
researcher _ Wright's data banks are used regularly by top corporate
and institutional economists _ states:
   ``One can understand George Bush's reluctance to ask for new
taxes and appreciate his concern that higher taxes could jeopardize
the economic expansion.''
   Incredibly, the doubts, the criticisms, the accusations continue
to build from those who believe that restrained spending and
continued economic growth can't do a better job than taxes in
correcting current economic imbalances.
   While Bush has surrounded himself with practical economic brains
he is still referred to as naive in some economic epistles written
from Wall Street and academe, some of them by theorists who served
in previous administrations.
   The doubts include questions about the man's sincerity,
understanding and directness. It is widely felt that some devious
tax plan is hidden somewhere in the White House, awaiting a more
propitious time.
   But, unless the president is prepared to eat his words, apologize
to the people and accept the negative political consequences, there
seems no way for him to back off from his promises.
   But, when you look at some of the numbers, you might ask: Why
should he?

<TEXT>
   A flurry of mergers in the Canadian airline, beer
and gasoline industries has touched off concern about the potential
for reduced competition and higher prices.
   Mergers are not new to Canadian business and corporate
consolidation long has been a controversial subject. But three big
deals in as many days last week was considered an unusually intense
level of activity.
   There also were predictions those deals could mark the start of a
bigger merger trend as companies strive to grow to meet global
competition, partly due to the free trade agreement with the United
States that went into effect Jan. 1.
   ``It means big business is getting bigger and that means higher
prices. In this case, big is definitely not better,'' David McKendry
of the Consumers Association of Canada told the Toronto Sun.
   Last Wednesday, Molson and Carling O'Keefe breweries announced a
merger forming Canada's largest beer company with 53 percent of the
market. Current leader John Labatt Ltd. has a 43 percent share.
Molson and Carling were Canada's second- and third-largest brewers,
respectively.
   A top goal for the new Molson Breweries company is to more than
double exports to the United States, where Canadian beer has been
gaining popularity.
   On Thursday, Canadian Airlines International announced it was
buying out Wardair for about $202.4 million in cash and stock. The
smaller Wardair had run a lower fare operation, and the sale is seen
as reducing fare pressure on privately-owned Canadian and on Air
Canada, which is 55 percent owned by the government.
   On Friday, Imperial Oil Ltd. _ the nation's biggest oil company _
won bidding for No. 4 Texaco Canada Inc. with an offer totaling
about $4.1 billion. Imperial is 70 percent owned by Exxon Corp., the
biggest U.S. oil company.
   The only larger deal in the Canadian oil industry was last year's
$4.6 billion purchase of Dome Petroleum Ltd. by Amoco Canada.
   The free trade issue was muted in the week's merger announcements
because the Canadian beer industry received special protection in
the pact signed last year by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and
then-President Reagan, American airlines did not get unlimited
access to Canadian airports under the deal and local gas stations
were exempted.
   Quoting figures from the federal Bureau of Competition, the Globe
and Mail newspaper has indicated the number of acquisitions in
Canada increased from 641 in 1984 to 1,082 in 1987.
   A recent study by the government's Statistics Canada agency
showed the share of business assets held by the top 25 Canadian
corporations increased to 35.1 percent in 1986 from 29.6 percent 10
years earlier.
   Shirley Carr, president of the Canadian Labor Congress, said she
was concerned about the potential for lost jobs.
   ``The corporations decided we should have free trade and now,
ever since the election, we've been hearing about nothing but
mergers and closures,'' she told the Toronto Star.
   Parliament approved the free trade agreement after Mulroney's
Progressive Conservative Party won its second consecutive majority
government in the Nov. 21 election.
   Imperial, which markets under the Esso brand in Canada,
guaranteed the jobs and benefits of the 3,300 Texaco employees, but
some job reduction was expected as a result of the beer and airline
mergers.
   Calvin Goldman, director of the federal Bureau of Competition,
has cautioned companies against completing merger arrangements
without authorization.
   ``Companies would be taking a chance were they to close a deal
before the competition bureau has had the opportunity to conduct a
full and thorough investigation of the proposed transaction,'' he
said in a statement that capped last week's merger binge.
   Federal regulations require companies to wait 21 days from
announcement to complete a merger, although the competition bureau
still can require changes after that three-week period.
   The Bureau of Competition has forced nine companies to
restructure or abandon mergers since 1986 while at least two others
were brought before a competition tribunal for public hearings,
according to the Globe and Mail.

   Share prices closed higher Monday but sharply below
their best levels on the London Stock Exchange as the market
succumbed to an afternoon bout of profit-taking sparked by a
downturn on Wall Street.
   Equities rose strongly in early trading, confounding many
dealers' expectations of an imminent setback to the recent strong
run that has taken the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index up about 7.4 percent since the start of the year.
   The recent renewed interest in the market on the part of
institutional investors was evident again Monday.
   ``People are slowly being pulled into it,'' one dealer said.
   At the close, the 100-share index was up 7.2 points, or 0.4
percent, at 1,924.7.
   This was well below the day's best level of 1,938.6 reached in
early afternoon. At its minimum, the index was unchanged shortly
after the opening.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 6.2 points at 1,569.5
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 4.34 points
to 1,084.03.
   Trading was active at 649.9 million shares, though well down from
Friday's heavy 903.2 million shares.
   Dealers expect the market to slow its recent ascent, if not
retrench at a lower level, ahead of Friday's scheduled release of
British trade figures for December.
   Most economists expect the figures to show a slight narrowing of
the current-account deficit from its 1.6 billion pound ($2.8
billion) shortfall in November.

<HEAD>Merrill Lynch Reports Jump In Fourth-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Monday said its earnings rose
sharply in the fourth quarter and all of 1988, as a huge
pension-related gain and other factors offset a one-third drop in
its commission revenue.
   Merrill Lynch reported fourth-quarter profits of $275.8 million,
rebounding from almost negligible earnings in the same period in
1987, when the stock market crashed.
   The nation's third-largest securities firm's earnings, equal to
$2.69 a share, were far above the earnings of $1.5 million in the
same period a year earlier. There were no earnings per common share
in the 1987 quarter after payment of preferred dividends.
   Revenue rose to $2.85 billion from $2.35 billion for the same
1987 quarter. For the full year, Merrill Lynch had earnings of $463
million, or $4.29 a share, including a huge after-tax gain from the
termination of an employee benefits plan. That was up 38 percent
from $335 million, or $3.07 a share, in 1987.
   Revenue for the year rose 7 percent to $10.5 billion from $9.88
billion in 1987. The 1988 period consisted of 53 weeks of operations
compared to 52 weeks the previous year.
   The biggest contribution to earnings was a $254.7 million
after-tax gain from the termination last October of a pension plan
that covered nearly all U.S. employees. The savings came from tax
provisions allowing a company to transfer funds from a terminated
pension plan to an employee stock ownership plan, as Merrill Lynch
did.
   Merrill Lynch said its commission revenue fell 33.3 percent for
the full year and 31.5 percent in the fourth quarter. But revenue
from investment banking, principal transactions and interest and
dividends rose.
   Merrill Lynch said that while retail demand for investment
products has slowed since the Oct. 19, 1987, market crash, customer
assets under management were up.
   Merrill Lynch also said it charged $44.4 million against
fourth-quarter earnings to merge or shrink some foreign and domestic
branch offices.
   Earnings for the quarter and full year of 1987 were restated to
reflect a change in the method of accounting for income taxes. The
restatement reduced net income by $55.4 million for the year and $2
million for the fourth quarter.
   Prior to the restatement, Merrill Lynch reported 1987 earnings of
$390.6 million.

<HEAD>Texas Eastern Looking for Alternatives _ Other Bidders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Eastern Corp. is not discarding Coastal
Corp.'s $2.6 billion buyout offer but plans to begin talks with
other possible suitors, the giant pipeline operator and oil producer
said.
   Dennis R. Hendrix, president and chief executive officer of Texas
Eastern, said the company would begin contacting other potential
buyers in two or three days.
   Following a Sunday morning meeting with Coastal executives,
Hendrix said his company's investment bankers reported there are
numerous alternatives to the Coastal offer.
   He said other companies have expressed an interest in Texas
Eastern, but he declined to identify them or to say when they had
contacted the company.
   Nevertheless, Texas Eastern has not ruled out the possibility
that Coastal's bid would eventually be accepted, he said.
   Officials of Coastal, which made its offer for Texas Eastern last
week, said they are not worried about another bidder.
   ``If they give us the same information, that's fine,'' Coastal
spokesman R.W. Wells said. ``We've said all along that if they show
us that our price is too low, we're willing to discuss anything,
including price.''
   James R. Paul, Coastal's president and chief operating officer,
said increasing his company's bid of $42 per share at this time
would be ``like going to an auction and bidding against ourselves.
We have the best and only offer on the table right now.''
   Hendrix said the Texas Eastern board was disappointed Coastal did
not increase its offer when Paul and James R. Cordes, executive vice
president of Coastal, met Sunday with the board.
   Industry observers had predicted a friendly merger agreement
could emerge from the talks, particularly if the offering price was
raised to between $45 and $47 a share.
   Coastal officials told the board ``they continue to believe $42
is a full and fair price despite the fact that Texas Eastern's stock
has traded above the Coastal bid price since the bid was
announced,'' Hendrix said.
   Texas Eastern's stock was trading at $48.62{ on the New York
Stock Exchange Monday, up from its close of $47.25 on Friday.
   Hendrix said the Texas Eastern board would meet again next
weekend to consider Coastal's bid when more details are known and
advisers had completed further analysis.
   Since Coastal's offer, the two Houston-based natural gas
companies have been in and out of court trying to prevent Texas
Eastern directors from implementing anti-takeover measures.
   U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes in Houston issued an injunction
to prevent Texas Eastern from initiating litigation in another court
without his permission. But Friday, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of
Appeals stayed Hughes' injunction.
   Hughes' ruling came after Coastal and two Texas Eastern
stockholders filed suits seeking an injunction to keep Texas Eastern
from using ``a poison pill'' to stop the tender offer.
   A poison pill typically is a measure that makes a hostile
takeover of a company prohibitively expensive. Hughes consolidated
the suits and set a hearing for Feb. 6.
   After Hughes' injunction was lifted, Texas Eastern filed a
lawsuit against Coastal and Colorado Interstate Corp., Coastal's
wholly owned subsidiary, in a Chancery Court in Delaware. The suit
asks the court to rule that Texas Eastern's Share Purchase Rights
Plan _ what Coastal and the two stockholders refer to as the
``poison pill'' _ is lawful. The plan was adopted in 1986 by the
company's board of diretors.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices were mostly higher while
prices for corn were mixed and soybeans mostly lower at the close
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures were supported by reports that the Soviet Union was
bidding on 660,000 tons of U.S. export bonus wheat and that the
Philippines was seeking offers on 365,000 tons of the commodity,
said grains analyst Jerry Gidel of G.H. Miller.
   Heavy weekend rains in Brazil and northern Argentina helped
improve the soybean crops there and bring a negative mood to soybean
trading, said Gidel.
   Volume was modest and continues to be affected by the FBI probe
of the futures markets in Chicago, Gidel said.
   ``Generally, it has had some effect,'' he said. ``It has caused
some confusion among traders.''
   Traders consider the markets oversold recently, and Monday's
gains reflected mostly ``a technical bounce following big losses,''
said Victor Lespinasse, a grains specialist with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   At the close of trading, wheat was unchanged to 2\ cents higher,
with the contract for delivery in March at $4.47\ a bushel; corn was
1\ cent lower to 1{ cents higher with the contract for delivery in
March at $2.69\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 2 cents higher with
March at $2.36 a bushel; and soybeans were unchanged to 8\ cents
lower with the March contract at $7.50{ a bushel.

   A late barrage of selling sent stock prices into

   In recent sessions, analysts said traders had been responding
favorably to generally strong fourth-quarter earnings reports.
   They said money managers at investing institutions continued to
put some of their large cash reserves into the market.
   But the market also was faced with selling by traders eager to
cash in on the gains in stock prices since late last year.
   The rally showed signs of bogging down last week when the Dow

<HEAD>Court Bars Seabrook From Rate Hike To Recoup Costs; Lawyer Ad Ban
Left Intact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court Monday refused to let Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire increase electric rates to help pay for
its share of the controversial Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   Separately, the high court let stand a California rule that
virtually bans all lawyer advertisements featuring testimonials or
client endorsements.
   In other action in business-related cases, the court:
   _Dealt a blow to some forms of affirmative action by striking
down a program aimed at helping construction industry businesses
owned by minorities. Voting 6-3, the court said the Richmond, Va.,
City Council unconstitutionally discriminated against whites in
saying a contractor on any city building contract must give at least
30 percent of the value of the project to firms at least one-half
minority owned.
   _Rejected an effort to preserve longshoremen's jobs threatened by
changing technology. Labor leaders warned that without the court's
help strikes that have disrupted the industry for more than 20 years
could resume.
   _Refused to hear an appeal by Atlanta-based pest controller Orkin
Exterminating Co. which had been ordered to roll back a fee increase
it charged to more than 200,000 customers nationwide. It rejected
arguments that Orkin acted in good faith in hiking renewal fees to
produce more than $7.5 million in extra revenue.
   _Left intact a $1.25 million punitive-damages award won against
an insurance company by an Alabama man suffering from cataracts in
both eyes, rejecting without comment an appeal by Nationwide Mutual
Insurance Co.
   In its decision on the Seabrook case, the court cited the lack of
a ``properly presented federal question'' and left intact a New
Hampshire law barring rate hikes to pay for nuclear plant
construction before the facilities are completed.
   Though completed two years ago, the Seabrook plant has not yet
received a federal license to operate.
   The New Hampshire Supreme Court last year upheld the state law
denying higher rates to Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, which
owns 35 percent of the Seabrook plant through a subsidiary. The
state court said the utility was not entitled to ``a bailout.''
   Other utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont and New
Hampshire also are owners of the Seabrook plant.
   Public Service of New Hampshire spent more than $1.77 billion to
build the plant, and the total project cost has been increasing at
the rate of $50 milllion a month since completed in late 1986.
   The utility filed for bankruptcy last January, seeking court
protection from its creditors. The federal Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has refused to license Seabrook to operate because the
plant lacks an approved evacuation plan.
   Public Service asked for an emergency rate increase of nearly $71
million a year in 1987 plus other financial help.
   The state Supreme Court upheld a New Hampshire law that says,
``At no time shall any (utility) rates or charges be based upon any
costs associated with construction work if said construction work is
not completed.''
   The state court said the law properly places the risk of building
nuclear plants with investors rather that consumers.
   ``The company is asking to shift the risk back to the
ratepayer,'' the state court said. ``The company and its investors
have eceived compensation for the risks they have assumed through an
enhanced rate of return and here seek relief from those risks now
that they have come to pass. Essentially, the company seeks a
bailout.''
   The creditors of Public Service joined the utility in urging the
justices to overturn the state court ruling.
   State officials were supported by New Hampshire's Consumer
Advocate Office in defending the state court decision.
   The Seabrook plant has had a troubled history. Besides delays and
mounting costs, it has encountered criticism from environmentalists
and anti-nuclear activists. Opposition from the state of
Massachusetts has stymied development of the evacuation plan for the
zone within 10 miles of the plant, a zone that includes several
Massachusetts communities.
   Concerning advertisements by the legal profession, the court had
been expected to use a challenge to the California rule to issue a
decision that would bind all the states.
   But, in a one-sentence opinion, the court said a Los Angeles
lawyer's appeal was being dropped ``for want of a properly presented
federal question.''
   The justices in 1977 ended the legal profession's longtime ban on
all lawyer advertising but left it to the states to ensure that ads
are not deceptive.
   The court said 12 years ago that lawyer advertising, like other
commercial speech, is not constitutionally protected if found to be
false or misleading.

   Stock prices fell Monday, yielding to a late wave
of selling as traders scrambled to cash in on the market's gains of
the past two months.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about eight points in
the early going, was off 16.97 at 2,218.39 by the close.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
553 up, 912 down and 515 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 141.64 million
shares, down from 166.10 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 167.72 million shares.
   In recent sessions, analysts said traders had been responding
favorably to generally strong fourth-quarter earnings reports.
   They also said money managers at investing institutions continued
to put some of their large cash reserves into the market.
   But the market also was faced with selling by traders eager to
cash in on the gains in stock prices since late last year.
   The rally showed signs of bogging down last week when the Dow
Jones industrial average approached 2,247 _ the level where it stood
just before it took a 508-point drop on Black Monday Oct. 19, 1987.
   Brokers say that is starting to shape up as an area of
psychological resistance for the market.
   Energy stocks sagged as oil prices dropped. Amoco fell 3 to 75|;
Exxon \ to 44}; Texaco 1{ to 54[; Chevron ] to 48~; Mobil [ to 47{,
and Schlumberger 1[ to 34[.
   Other losers among the blue-chip industrials included
International Business Machines, down 1\ at 122]; General Electric,
down \ at 45]; USX, down 1[ at 30], and United Technologies, down \
at 43|.
   Money-center bank stocks were mostly lower in response to a Wall
Street Journal column citing new concerns about Third World debt
problems.
   J.P. Morgan dropped | to 34\; Chase Manhattan \ to 31[;
Bankamerica | to 19]; Chemical Banking ] to 31[, and Manufacturers
Hanover { to 29|.
   Data General fell 1[ to 17. The company reported a $19.5 million
loss for its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 24.
   Texas Eastern led the active list, up 1\ at 48{. The company said
it would look for other parties interested in topping a $42-a-share
takeover offer by Coastal Corp.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $16.82 billion, or 0.60
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.03 to 160.13.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.58 to 328.83, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down 2.13 at 284.50.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 1.67 to 389.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 318.03, down 1.49.

   Automobile entrepreneur Malcolm Bricklin announced
plans Monday for a network of 1,000 dealerships featuring glitzy,
high-tech video booths that he says could make traditional showrooms
obsolete.
   ``We're going to present to you in living color every single car
in the whole world,'' said Bricklin, who introduced Japan's Subaru
and the Yugoslavian Yugo to the American market. ``Eventually, I
don't see that many cars in a showroom anymore.''
   Boasting that the venture's annual sales could reach $10 billion,
Bricklin said he is lining up 10 ``megadealers,'' who already own
multiple automobile franchises, for the core of Bricklin Motors.
   The megadealers, who will own between 2 percent and 4 percent of
Bricklin Motors, in turn would concentrate on quickly buying
existing dealerships. The group plans to pay cash for an 80 percent
stake in each of the individual dealerships.
   Identities of the dealerships would remain the same, with some
reference to Bricklin tacked on.
   ``If we do what we plan on doing, we should be in excess of $10
billion in sales by this time next year,'' Bricklin said.
   His proposed dealerships would feature a 10-by-10-foot ``closing
booth,'' where prospective buyers would view a sound and light show
that Bricklin promised would be like no other in the automotive
business.
   ``If I can get people to come in and bring them something like an
auto show and show them all the cars, you will go out and see people
that you know and recommend that they see the booth for no reason
other than itself,'' he said in a telephone interview from his ranch
in Meeker, Colo.
   Bricklin gave few other details of the booth but said it cost $1
million to $1.5 million to develop. After becoming fully
operational, Bricklin said, booths would cost about $50,000 apiece.
   He plans to bring his dealer plan and a half-size scale model of
the booth to the National Automobile Dealers Association convention
opening Saturday in New Orleans.
   Bricklin brought the Japanese automaker Subaru to the United
States in 1968 and introduced the Yugo here two years ago. He sold
his 70 percent stake in troubled Yugo last May.
   In the late 1960s, he made an ill-fated attempt to market a
gull-wing sports car named the Bricklin, but the company went
bankrupt after producing just a few cars. After Fiat pulled out of
the United States in 1983, he formed a corporation to import two
Italian sports cars.
   Under Bricklin's new plan, the 1,000 dealerships that Bricklin
hopes to acquire in three years would be linked by satellite for
daily sales meetings.
   The dealerships also would have 24-hour service departments with
loaner or rental cars, depending on what kind of service plan a
consumer purchases.
   Robert Arnold, executive vice president of Printon Kane Capital
Corp., a New York investment banking firm advising Bricklin, said
negotiations are under way with four dealerships interested in
becoming part of the core. Arnold and Bricklin declined to identify
the dealers.
   The business would be funded substantially by junk bonds, or
high-yield bonds issued by companies with less-than-investment grade
ratings, Arnold said.

   The dollar fell against most major currencies
Monday in response to renewed dollar sales by central banks and a
bearish statement by a West German banking official.
   The major European central banks, the Bank of Canada and the U.S.
Federal Reserve cut off a dollar rally early in the New York trading
day with three coordinated bouts of intervention, traders said.
   As usual, the Bank of Japan stayed out of the action. Traders
believe the Japanese central bank is being reserved as the ultimate
weapon in case massive central-bank action is needed to stabilize
the dollar.
   Leonhard Gleske, a director of the West German Bundesbank, was
reported to have said he would prefer to see the dollar fall below
1.8 marks. That statement was influential in driving the dollar
down, said Alexis Egan, a trader at Banque Indosuez in New York.
   The central banks' concerted action seems to have taken away some
of the bullishness toward the dollar that prevailed for most of
January, said James Pugh, vice president for foreign exchange at
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   ``Although I don't believe intervention works in the long run,
they've got to the point where the dollar longs (those bullish
toward the dollar) are scared,'' Pugh said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.15 Japanese yen to a closing 128.20 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 127.80 yen. In New York the dollar fell to
127.55 yen from 127.68 yen late Friday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7733 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7670 late Friday.
But the pound edged lower later in New York to $1.7760 from $1.7765
late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
levels, included: 1.8319 West German marks, down from 1.8365; 1.5490
Swiss francs, down from 1.5600; 1.1883 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1894; 6.2328 French francs, down from 6.2598; and 1,343.5 Italian
lire, down from 1,346.1.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
levels, included: 1.8385 West German marks, down from 1.8425; 1.5577
Swiss francs, down from 1.5665; 6.2545 French francs, down from
6.2715; 2.0780 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0800; 1,353.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,351.75; and, 1.1888 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1868.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $407.75 a troy ounce,
compared with $405.25 bid late Friday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold
rose to $407.40 bid from $404.85 bid late Friday. Earlier, in Hong
Kong, gold fell 33 cents to close at a bid $409.15.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $407.80 a troy ounce from $408.50 an ounce Friday.
   Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at
$407 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $408 late Friday.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.20 a troy ounce, compared with
Friday's $6.05. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery rose to $6.194 an ounce from $6.183 Friday.

   Chicago's freewheeling futures traders are
learning the hard way what Wall Street investment bankers have known
for some time: when the markets appear unable to police themselves,
the government steps in with tough measures ranging from grand jury
subpoenas to FBI sting squads.
   A massive federal probe into possibly widespread corruption in
the Chicago futures markets has raised key parallels to the insider
trading crackdown that has tainted the New York-based securities
industry for more than two years, several lawyers and trading
experts said Monday.
   One of the most important resemblances, they said, was the
strong-arm intervention of the Justice Department into areas that
historically has been supervised largely by the business itself.
   ``I think every so often you've got to shake up the system,''
said Howard Schneider, a former counsel to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, the federal regulatory body that oversees the
futures pits. ``This is a shakeup of the system. Hopefully the
self-regulators will see this and do a better job.''
   The investigation of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago
Board of Trade, which first surfaced last week, included secret FBI
plants disguised as floor traders, who taped conversations of
alleged wrongdoing.
   At least 100 people were subpoenaed by the Chicago U.S.
attorney's office in what has become the biggest fraud crackdown in
the history of the wild Chicago futures markets.
   The use of stool pigeons, surveillance and the threat of
indictment and disgrace in the Chicago probe in some ways echoes the
tactics used in late 1986 to expose a massive insider trading scheme
on Wall Street.
   Although it is too early to measure the outcome of the Chicago
investigation, legal experts said the government appears to be
relying on shock value, secrecy and pressure on people to cooperate
or face harsh penalties.
   That is the same strategy used effectively by the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office to frighten many alleged wrongdoers _ notably the
infamous speculator Ivan Boesky and the ``junk bond'' securities
giant Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. _ to cooperate in the insider
trading scandal,
   ``The Justice Department wants to make a very strong statement
not just about Chicago and New York, but about the credibility of
the marketplace,'' said Jack Barbanel, a futures strategist at the
New York investment firm Gruntal &amp; Co. ``It's a step beyond just
leaving things with the SEC and CFTC.''
   At the same time, the Chicago and New York crackdowns show marked
differences that perhaps reflect the intrinsic contrasts of the
frenzied futures pits and the clubby, more subtle relationships
among stock traders.
   For one thing, the alleged frauds in Chicago, which included
cheating customers and masking trading income, reportedly were
brazen acts committed on the exchange floors.
   The New York scandal, on the other hand, involved crimes
committed via clandestine arrangements and ferreted out afterward
via exhaustive research work and paper-trail hunting by SEC lawyers
and federal prosecutors.
   ``The Wall Street stuff was the type of conduct you don't get
eyewitnesses to,'' said Ira Lee Sorkin, a former SEC administrator
who now practices securities law in New York.
   ``Securities cases and corruption cases are done secretly,'' he
said. ``They're not like bank robberies, with fingerprints and
bloodstains and getaway cars. They're done among only those engaged
in the conduct.''
   Another key difference in the New York and Chicago scandals
appears to be the level of market involvement in each probe.
   The New York Stock Exchange provided information about many of
the key trades that federal investigators have used to piece
together their insider trading prosecutions. In Chicago, market
officials evidently knew little or nothing about the FBI probe in
their midst until it was exposed last week.
   ``There's no such thing as courtesy in law enforcement,'' said
Michael Feldberg, a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor
in Manhattan. ``Why should they let the exchanges know? When you
have an undercover in place, you try to get as much information as
you can until the game's over.''

<HEAD>Grain Futures Mixed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices for grains were mixed Monday on the Chicago Board
of Trade as trading volume continues to be affected by the FBI probe
of alleged fraud on the CBOT and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   ``Generally, it has had some effect,'' said Tom Gidel, grains
analyst with G.H. Miller. ``It has caused some confusion among
traders.''
   Wheat futures prices were supported by reports that the Soviet
Union was bidding on 660,000 tons of U.S. export bonus wheat and
that the Philippines was seeking offers on 365,000 tons of the
commodity, said Gidel, based in Chicago.
   Heavy weekend rains in Brazil and northern Argentina helped
improve the prospects of soybean crops there, resulting in a
negative mood in soybean trading, said Gidel.
   Wheat settled \ cent lower to 1\ cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in March at $4.44} a bushel; corn was 1{ cent lower to
2{ cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $2.70\ a
bushel; oats were unchanged to 2 cents higher with March at $2.36 a
bushel; and soybeans were 5 cents higher to 4 cents lower with the
March contract at $7.55{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures prices mostly retreated on the Merc.
   Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington
Heights, Ill., said he also thinks the FBI probe has had some impact
on trading lately.
   ``It's got to have a little impact. The bigger traders are off
looking for lawyers,'' he said. ``But overall it shouldn't have a
big impact because the commercial houses do the bulk of the trading
and they aren't affected.''
   Prices for frozen pork bellies were depressed by expectations of
record supplies Tuesday when the Agriculture Department delivers its
cold storage report on Dec. 31 inventories.
   Steady to lower spot prices sent live hog prices lower, said
Morgan, while a weakness in wholesale prices and on the spot market
lowered prices for cattle futures.
   Live cattle settled .43 cent lower to .05 cent higher, with the
February contract at 72.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25
cent to .42 cent lower with the contract for delivery in January at
83.72 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .53 cent lower with
February at 43.32 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .40
cent to 2.00 cents lower, with the February contract at 39.40 cents
a pound.
   Prices for copper futures rose toward record highs on the
Commodity Exchange in New York.
   The contract for March settled at $1.50.70, a Comex high for a
``nearby active'' copper contract, said George Anagnos, a metals
analyst in New York with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   The January contract was less than 8 cents shy of the spot record
of $1.64.75.
   The copper market continued its rally despite increased
inventories, because demand remains quite strong and many traders
have been concerned with mining problems in Peru, Chile and Zambia,
according to Anagnos.
   Copper settled 1.3 cents to 2.9 cents higher with the contract
for January at $1.57 a pound.
   Gold was slightly lower and silver higher on the Commodity
Exchange in New York.
   Precious metals trading was basically influenced by the dollar
and oil prices, said Anagnos.
   ``For the fourth consecutive day, international intervention
against the dollar knocked the dollar down, and made gold and silver
prices steady to slightly higher,'' he said. ``But the extent of the
rally was abbreviated by a drop in oil prices and its deflationary
implications.''
   Prices for precious metals usually move in the opposite direction
of the dollar and inflation.
   Gold settled 70 cents to 80 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in January at $407.80 per troy ounce; silver was 1.1 cents
to 2.0 cents with the January contract at $6.19 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures prices were sharply lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 66 cents to $1.06 lower
with the contract for delivery in March at $17.33 a barrel; heating
oil was 1.68 cents to 2.24 cents lower, with the February contract
at 50.36 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Data General Posts Loss; Lotus Earnings Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Data General Corp. said Monday it lost money in its latest
quarter on a 10 percent decline in revenue, while Lotus Development
Corp. said its quarterly earnings dropped 61 percent.
   Data General, the Westboro, Mass.-based minicomputer maker,
attributed the loss to an interruption in sales from a transition to
a new line of computers as well as investment in a coming line of
industry-standard computers.
   Lotus, the Cambridge, Mass.-based maker of personal computer
software, said results were hurt by marketing and sales programs
intended to protect the leadership of its Lotus 1-2-3 in the
electronic spreadsheet market as well as research and development
spending.
   Data General said it lost $19.5 million in its first fiscal
quarter, compared with earnings of $13.8 million, or 48 cents a
share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue fell to $309
million from $343 million a year earlier.
   Lotus said it earned $9 million, or 21 cents a share, in its
fourth quarter, down from $22.9 million, or 50 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue dipped to $112.4 million from $115.6 million.
   For its full fiscal year, Lotus said its earnings fell to $58.9
million, or $1.29 a share, from $72 million, or $1.58 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 18 percent, to $468.5 million from $395.6
million in 1987.
   On a positive note, Lotus said international sales grew 44
percent in 1988.

<HEAD>Urge Government to Work With Foreign Companies to Exploit Oil Find</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political leaders called on the government
Monday to strengthen relations with foreign companies to exploit a
giant crude oil discoveries in the Amazon jungle and ease Peru's
acute economic problems.
   President Alan Garcia announced Saturday that Occidental
Petroleum Corp. had discovered an estimated 600 million barrels of
oil in a remote area, which if confirmed would more than double
Peru's current proven reserves.
   Garcia valued the oil at $10 billion or more, and said it would
supply Peru's domestic needs and export requirements for 15 years.
   Gaston Acurio of the opposition center-right party Popular Action
said in a radio interview Monday that the government must ``offer
sufficient guarantees to foreign companies to ensure the oil does
not remain below the ground.''
   Garcia's announcement came against a background of strained
relations between the impoverished South American nation and foreign
companies.
   Several foreign oil concerns operated in Peru during the late
1970s after oil was discovered in the Amazon and oil became Peru's
major foreign exchange earner.
   Since then, political unrest and changing policies have
frightened most foreign firms, while restricting Occidental and the
state oil company Petro-Peru from expanding production and
exploration.
   Since Garcia took office in mid-1985, the government has
nationalized a handful of foreign companies and taken other steps
considered hostile to investment from abroad, including limits on
repayment of foreign loans.
   Occidental now is the only foreign oil company actively exploring
oil production, the government says.
   Officials did not comment Monday on the possibility of financing
Peru's estimated $19 billion foreign debt with potential income from
the reported jungle oil find.
   Crude production has fallen during the decade from a high of
nearly 200,000 barrels a day to 140,000 barrels, slightly more than
Peru needs for domestic use.
   Former Finance Minister Javier Silva, a senator from the centrist
Solidarity and Democracy Party, charged Garcia overestimated the oil
discovery in an effort to divert attention from the nation's
problems.
   ``I fear we are dealing once again with a smoke curtain to hide a
grave internal situation marked by leftist guerrilla violence and an
economic crisis,'' he was quoted by the Lima newspaper Expreso as
saying.
   Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company a year ago announced the discovery
of natural gas in a jungle zone near the Ucayali region estimated at
7 trillion cubic feet, the energy equivalent of 1.2 billion barrels
of oil.
   But a tentative contract with Shell to produce the gas was
scrapped amid bitter internal debate led by leftist politicians, who
said the contract exploited the Peruvians.
   A year ago, the government revealed a tentative contract
exploration contract had been reached with Mobil Oil Corp. but the
firm denied the statement a day later.
   Occidental Petroleum spokesman Armando Lasarte Monday refused to
confirm or deny any of the comments made by Garcia concerning the
discovery and its estimated size. He referred further questions to
the state oil company Petro-Peru, which also refused to comment.
   Industry analysts said it will take at least two years and cost
more than $2 billion to contruct a pipeline from the zone over the
two-mile high Andes to coastal population centers.
   Officials also said such a pipeline would face sabotage by Maoist
Shining Path guerrillas, whose nearly nine-year insurgency has
claimed more than 12,000 lives and caused damage of more than $10
billion.

   A $30 million settlement has been reached
in a lawsuit filed by ComputerLand Corp. franchise operators against
the company, the nation's largest franchised retail computer store
chain, it was announced on Monday.
   The settlement with the 800-store company provides for a
permanent contractual reduction in franchisee royalty rates to 5
percent from 8 percent, according to attorney Norman Stone, who
represented the plaintiffs in the class action suit.
   ComputerLand attorney Edward Keech said that ``broadly defined,
the class represents all present and former U.S. franchisees.''
   The suit was initially filed in 1984 by Michael Belling and
Kenneth Klein, the former operators of ComputerLand stores in Marin
County. They alleged the company failed to ship them products,
leading to lost profits and eventually the loss of their stores.
   A class action was filed a year later on behalf of all stores
worldwide, said Ralph Miller, a spokesman for the plaintiffs. He
said the action was cut to only U.S. store operators which ``meant
about 500 people.''
   The suit also contended that ComputerLand failed to pass on
inventory and supplies at cost, did not obtain the best prices
available for franchisees' benefit, failed to pass on discounts to
the stores and did not take favorable trade terms when offered by
suppliers, Stone said.
   The reduction in royalty rates ``represents a savings of
approximately $23.4 million to member franchisees'' over the next
three years alone, he said.
   As part of the settlement, Keech said, ComputerLand received a
release from the plaintiffs giving up their right to sue the company.
   The cash portion of the settlement comes from insurance funds,
said Keech.

   Lawyers for Eastman Kodak Co. asked a
state judge Monday to dismiss a $200 million environmental lawsuit
filed against the company because the claims are too broad and vague.
   The request came in a lawsuit filed last year in connection with
the photo giant's alleged chemical contamination of neighborhoods
around its manufacturing complex known as Kodak Park.
   State Supreme Court Justice Raymond Cornelius reserved decision
on the request.
   If Cornelius agrees with Kodak, the lawsuit comes to a quick end.
If he doesn't, the lawsuit continues and Kodak may be required to
turn over records and submit its employees to lengthy legal
depositions.
   Kodak attorneys claim that the lawsuit should be thrown out of
court now because it seeks to represent a ``cumbersome and
unmanageable'' group of people who have little in common, and
allowing the case to continue under those circumstances would be
costly and time-consuming to the company.
   ``This (the lawsuit) couldn't be broader. It couldn't be more
diverse. It couldn't claim more types of injuries,'' argued Michael
Wolford, an attorney representing Kodak.
   The lawsuit, filed on behalf of several former residents of a
neighborhood near Kodak Park, asks Cornelius to grant the case
class-action status so it can represent all the people who live and
work, or who have lived or worked, within one mile of the company's
sprawling factory.
   Wolford said that would include at least 75,000 people.
   However, an attorney for those who filed the suit told Cornelius
that the only way to define the group of people affected by Kodak's
alleged chemical contamination is to allow the case to continue.
   Arnold Levin, representing the plaintiffs, said he needs access
to Kodak's records and personnel to determine the scope of the group
of plaintiffs.

<HEAD>LBO Sponsors On The Defensive As Congressional Hearings Begin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The people who have made the leveraged buyout one
of the most popular avenues for financing blockbuster corporate
acquisitions are being asked to explain to Congress why their
controversial methods should not be curtailed.
   Leveraged buyouts _ acquisitions made mainly with borrowed money
that is repaid by the target company _ have made possible many of
this country's biggest corporate purchases, such as the recent
record-shattering $24.53 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc.
   But critics of LBOs contend the deals can cost jobs as new owners
seek to cut costs at the suddenly debt-burdened companies. They also
say taxpayers are helping finance LBOs through tax breaks given to
buyers and that the higher debt burdens raise the risk that the
acquired companies will fail.
   The criticism has increased over the past year, partly because of
publicity surrounding the RJR Nabisco deal and other huge buyouts.
   Nine congressional committees plan hearings about LBOs, with the
Senate Finance Committee scheduled to hold the first session on
Tuesday.
   Some major LBO sponsors say the deals have not hurt the target
companies or the taxpayer.
   ``If you get someone who is trying to do a very good job of
analyzing what's going on, I think the analysis would lead you to
conclude (LBOs are) a net positive,'' said Joseph L. Rice, a partner
in the investment firm and LBO specialist Clayton &amp; Dubilier Inc.
   In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy out a
company and pay off the debt with the target company's cash flow or
the sale of its assets, including its divisions and subsidiaries. To
improve a company's cash flow acquirers may cut its costs, and that
can mean layoffs.
   Kohlberg Kravis _ the undisputed leader in the field _ contends
that a study it undertook to counter its critics indicates the 15
firms it acquired through leveraged buyouts had a total employment
increase of 37,000.
   Rice said although an LBO business might be pared down, ``by and
large employment is either up or flat'' at companies Clayton &amp;
Dubilier has acquired.
   He also said leveraged buyouts provided opportunities for people
who otherwise could not afford to buy a company, and called the
process ``the last great bastion for the entrepreneur in the United
States today.''
   But critics say the heavy borrowing needed to create those
opportunities put a company and its lenders in jeopardy. Buyouts
often financed are with junk bonds, higher-risk loans that pay a
higher rate of interest.
   Critics point to Revco D.S. Inc., the large Ohio-based drugstore
chain that went private in a $1.5 billion LBO in 1986 and last year
filed for federal bankruptcy protection from its creditors after it
failed to make a $46 million payment to junk bond holders.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist for Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., said the failure of LBO companies was a risk that could be
realized if the economy slides into a recession and the companies no
longer could generate the revenue to make their payments.
   But Rice said the higher debt levels of LBO companies generally
have benefited stockholders and the economy.
   ``If you take a look at buyouts over an extended period of time,
say for the last 20 years, you would conclude the businesses that
have been bought have used a very significant amount of debt in
their capital structure,'' he said. ``Many worldwide competitors
have used debt for years and used it effectively.''
   Opponents also want to rein in buyouts by amending the federal
income tax laws, which currently give an acquirer a deduction for
all interest payments.
   President Bush said recently a review of the tax laws might be in
order to curb any abuses, but he would not advocate government
action to put the brakes on takeovers.
   The Kohlberg Kravis study contends the firm's buyouts have not
shortchanged the Treasury, and actually have added $2 billion to
federal coffers, while Rice called buyouts ``a net tax-producer.''
   Ms. Latta said the government did reap short-term benefits from a
leveraged buyout, because stockholders tendering their shares to the
acquirer paid capital gains taxes. But the government may be losing
out through long-term tax benefits to the acquirer, she said.
   ``If there were no long-term tax gains for the company, they
probably would not be doing it,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The lawyer who successfully defended John De
Lorean on cocaine conspiracy and fraud charges said Monday that the
former auto executive owes him $683,392 in unpaid legal fees earned
in another case.
   ``He owes me close to $700,000, and if it wasn't for me he'd
certainly be in a different position than he's in now,'' attorney
Howard Weitzman said. ``Sometimes I don't understand clients, and
he's one of them.''
   A Superior Court suit filed Dec. 16 by Weitzman and his law firm
alleges De Lorean has failed to pay the legal bills or to respond to
letters sent to him.
   De Lorean, who lives in New York, declined through Detroit lawyer
Mayer Morganroth to comment on the Weitzman case.
   Attorney Karen Randall, who is handling the suit for the firm
Wyman, Bautzer, Kuchel &amp; Silbert, said De Lorean and the firm agreed
orally in April 1986 to certain legal services involving a federal
tax trial in Detroit.
   De Lorean was found innocent in the Detroit case, which dealt
with charges of fraud, racketeering and income tax evasion. Weitzman
also won acquittal for De Lorean in the Los Angeles cocaine and
fraud case that year.

<TEXT>
   The Travelers Corp. announced Monday that
it has eliminated 225 jobs as part of a program designed to cut
costs.
   Ninety-three people, including 49 in the Hartford area and 44
elsewhere in the country, were told Monday that their jobs were
being eliminated, while 132 workers accepted a ``voluntary
separation option,'' the company said.
   The 93 people losing their jobs will be given help finding new
jobs within or outside of the company, officials said.
   Employees who aren't placed in new jobs by the company will
receive a minimum of 60 days notice of their terminations and up to
one year's salary, the company said.
   The Travelers said the latest job reductions, which will take
place over the next 12 months, and other cost-saving measures
implemented Monday would result in an annual savings of $20 million.
   It boosts the total estimated savings resulting from a year-long
analysis of the company's operations is $145 million, the company
said.
   Last June, the Travelers announced the elimination of 465 jobs
nationwide. The Travelers employed 34,021 people as of Dec. 31, 1988.
   Alan Fletcher, a Travelers spokesman, said Monday's action marked
the end of major job redutions for the insurer, although analysis of
ways to cut costs would continue.
   In the third quarter of 1988, the Travelers had operating
earnings of $87 million, down from $108 million in the same quarter
of 1987. Nine-month operating earnings fell to $192 million compared
with $330 million in the first nine months of 1987.

   Centaur Partners said Monday it had received

bid for Pennwalt Corp.
   Centaur said it had received commitments from a syndicate of
banks and other financial institutions for $250 million in financing
for its $100-a-share cash bid for the chemical company.
   The partnership previously announced that National Westminster
Bank and Marine Midland Bank agreed to provide $200 million in

$400 million in bonds to finance the offer.
   Pennwalt's board of directors has rejected the bid, leading
Centaur to begin soliciting proxies for a special shareholders
meeting. The partnership wants to remove the board and replace it
with directors who would be more sympathetic toward Centaur's bid.
   Pennwalt, based in Philadelphia, is seeking a federal court
injunction against the proxy solicitation.

   Union Carbide Corp. said Monday its
fourth-quarter profit swelled ninefold and its earnings for all of
1988 more than tripled compared with results a year earlier.
   For the fourth quarter of 1988, Carbide reported net income of
$219 million, or $1.59 per share, compared with $23 million, or 17
cents a share, in the same period in 1987.
   Fourth-quarter sales increased 16 percent to $2.14 billion,
compared with $1.85 billion for the same period a year ago.
   The 1987 figures include a $53 million fourth-quarter after-tax
charge to cover litigation contingencies, including those stemming
from the 1984 gas leak at the company's plant in Bhopal, India.
   For the full year, Union Carbide reported preliminary net income
of $720 million, or $5.31 per share, compared with $232 million, or
$1.76 a share, a year earlier.
   Full-year revenue rose 20 percent to $8.32 billion from $6.91

<TEXT>
   The imprisoned ex-president of the failed
securities company Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman Inc. pleaded guilty
Monday to perjury for denying involvement in the fraud that led to
the firm's $144 million collapse.
   Gilbert C. Schulman, 41, also admitted lying when he denied
during two trials in April 1987 and July 1987 that he regularly
received secret interest rate data from a board member of the New
York Federal Reserve Bank, Robert A. Rough.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Weissman said Schulman would be
called as a witness against Rough at Rough's trial on insider
trading charges, scheduled to begin Feb. 21.
   Schulman testified he and Rough were friends for 15 years and
talked regularly during 1982 to 1984, when Rough served on the New
York Fed's board as president of the National Bank of Sussex County
in Branchville, but that no secret information was exchanged. Rough
has pleaded innocent.
   Schulman admitted guilt at a hearing before U.S. District Judge
Dickinson R. Debevoise, during which his attorneys asked for a
reduction of his eight-year sentence for securities and tax fraud.
   They suggested a total 30-month sentence _ he has served 16
months at the Allenwood, Pa., prison camp _ and five years
probation, including 2,500 hours of community service at a soup
kitchen.
   Debevoise refused, slicing only two years off the sentence.
   The judge recognized Schulman's cooperation in the government's
investigation of Rough.
   ``However, I must say my cynicism does have some effect here,''
he said. He noted that Schulman denied the charges in two trials,
the second resulting from a mistrial on some charges.
   ``When that failed, you turned over somebody to the government
for prosecution,'' Debevoise said.
   One of Schulman's attorneys, Benson B. Weintraub, said his client
was the subject of ``harassment and ridicule'' by other inmates and
staff at Allenwood because of his cooperation.
   ``He wears the jacket, your honor, of a snitch,'' he said.
   Rough, 49, was indicted Dec. 8 on charges that he leaked to
Bevill, Bresler secret data on the discount rate set by the Federal
Reserve Board in Washington.
   The discount rate has a bearing on the securities market, and the
indictment said Bevill, Bresler made millions of dollars and avoided
losses on the basis of the information. In exchange, Rough allegedly
received $47,000 in interest-deferred loans.
   The brokerage house collapsed in April 1985. Four executives who
pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors were subsequently
imprisoned for charges stemming from the collapse.

   Amoco Corp. Monday reported a $2 million decline in its
fourth-quarter income, saying gains in refining operations were
offset by low energy prices.
   Two other oil companies, Atlantic Richfield Co. and Ashland Oil
Inc., both reported double-digit increases in after-tax earnings for
the same 1988 period.
   Amoco, based in Chicago, said its earnings totaled $375 million
in the three months ended Dec. 31, or $1.45 a share, on revenue of
$6.2 billion. That compared with earnings of $377 million, or $1.47
a share, in the corresponding 1987 quarter when revenue came to $5.9
billion.
   For all of last year, earnings were $2.06 billion, or $8.01 a
share, up 52 percent from the previous year's $1.36 billion, or
$5.31 a share. Revenue for the year was $23.93 billion, up from
$22.46 billion in 1987, Amoco said.
   Richard Morrow, Amoco's chairman and chief executive, said the
company showed good profit margins for the fourth quarter, due to
high customer demand for chemical products and gains in
transportation operations.
   ``Chemical results benefited from continued high levels of
customer demand which resulted in strong margins for most product
lines,'' Morrow said in a statement.
   But those gains were offset by a drop in earnings from
exploration and production operations because of lower worldwide
energy prices, he said.
   Last year's overall earnings growth reflected record profits from
refining, marketing and transportation operations and chemical
business.
   Los Angeles-based Arco said its net income totaled $391 million,
or $2.22 a share, up 15 percent from $340 million, or $1.86 a share,
in the fourth 1987 quarter. Fourth-quarter revenue was $4.55
billion, down from $4.62 billion a year earlier.
   Arco said it earned $1.58 billion, or $8.78 a share, in all of
1988, up from $1.22 billion, or $6.68 a share, the previous year.
Sales were $18.32 billion, up from $16.98 billion in 1987.
   ``We were extremely pleased with our strong performance in 1988,
which was achieved despite a continuing decline in crude prices,''
said Lodwrick Cook, Arco's chairman and chief executive officer.
``... The primary earnings contributors were our downstream
operations.''
   Ashland said its first-quarter earnings, for the three-month
period ended Dec. 31, rose 20 percent to $96 million, or $1.72 a
share, from $80 million, or $1.41 a share, in the year-earlier
quarter. Revenue totaled $2.1 billion, up slightly from $2 billion.
   The previous year's earnings reflected a gain of $40 million, or
71 cents a share, from the adoption of a required tax accounting
adjustment. The latest period's figures reflected an after-tax gain
of $18 million, or 33 cents a share, the Ashland, Ky.-based company
said.
   Ashland Chairman John Hall said strong refinery margins in
October and November substantially boosted the earnings of the
company's Ashland Petroleum subsidiary. Its SuperAmerica and Ashland
Chemical units also turned in strong performances, while its
engineering and construction operations had a disappointing quarter,
he said.
   ``Although the recent rapid increase in crude oil prices has
caused refinery margins to decline to marginally profitable levels
which is typical for this time of year, we remain optimistic that
1989 will be another good year for Ashland,'' Hall said.

<DATELINE>MAPLEWOOD, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.
reported Monday that its fourth-quarter profit jumped 25.7 percent
from a year earlier.
   The diversified manufacturer said it earned $272 million, or
$1.21 a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $216 million,
or 95 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
   Fourth-quarter revenue grew 8.6 percent, to $2.57 billion from
$2.37 billion a year earlier.
   For all of 1988, annual profit topped $1 billion for the first
time, 3M said.
   Earnings for 1988 rose to $1.15 billion, or $5.09 a share, up
from the previous record of $918 million, or $4.02 a share, in 1987.
It was the largest increase in 12 years and came on record revenue
of $10.58 billion, 12.2 percent higher than 1987's $9.42 billion,
the company said.
   Allen F. Jacobson, chairman and chief executive officer, said
improved overseas sales contributed to the record year. In addition,
more than 30 percent of sales in 1988 came from products introduced
within the last five years, he said.
   ``Our earnings now have increased nearly 75 percent in the last
three years,'' Jacobson said in a statement. ``Sales are up 35
percent over the same period.''
   Jacobson said 3M also increased research and development spending
10 percent to $689 million, or 6.5 percent of sales.
   The company benefited from a lower tax rate and weaker dollar,
Jacobson said. The lower price of the dollar in overseas sales
contributed an estimated $46 million, or 20 cents a share, to 1988
earnings, he said.
   ``We look for economic growth to moderate and inflation to
accelerate slightly,'' Jacobson said. ``In addition, strengthening
of the U.S. dollar could result in slightly negative currency
effects.''

   A federal judge Monday took under advisement a
motion by two unions to dismiss a lawsuit in which Texas Air and
Eastern Airlines ask damages of $2.5 billion.
   MIAMI (AP) _ A federal judge Monday took under advisement a
motion by two unions to dismiss a lawsuit in which Texas Air Corp.
and its subsidiary Eastern Airlines ask damages of $2.5 billion.
   U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler said he is inclined to
dismiss complaints against 38 officers and directors in the two
unions. The complaints are part of the suit.
   ``This is subject to whatever else I might decide in this case,''
Hoeveler said.
   The suit by Eastern and Texas Air was filed in May 1988 under a
civil racketeering (RICO) statute, alleging mail and wire fraud and
extortion under the federal Hobbs Act against the Air Line Pilots
Association and the International Association of Machinists District
100 AFL-CIO.
   The suit charges RICO and RICO conspiracy ``through a pattern of
criminal activities and defamation of Eastern Airlines and Texas
Air.''
   During three hours of argument before Hoeveler, attorneys for the
unions attacked the suit at two levels.
   Joseph Guerrieri Jr. of Washington, D.C., an attorney for the
machinists, told Hoeveler the suit should have been filed as a
counterclaim to a suit filed in 1987 in Washington by the unions
against the airlines.
   That suit, now before U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker in
the District of Columbia, alleged that Texas Air was dismantling
Eastern to destroy its unions.
   Parker C. Folse III of Houston, representing Texas Air, responded
that the issue before the District of Columbia court is ``entirely
different from the issue before this court.'' Folse added that
``access to documents and witnesses is much more convenient in this
district.''
   But most of the argument came concerning the issues advanced in
the suit charging the unions with violation of the Racketeering Act.
   Representing the Air Line Pilots Association, attorney Jed Rakoff
of New York said the Miami suit, if successful, ``would set back
labor law by a century. It would hold that legitimate union activity
constituted a crime.''
   Richard Ruda, an attorney for the machinists, said the case
``involves a classic labor dispute.'' He said the suit was filed
``just to keep the unions in line. ... It is a blatant misuse of the
RICO act.''
   Representing the Air Line Pilots Association, Thomasina Williams
said the acts charged against the union were ``all protected and
were not extortionate conduct.''
   In answer to the individual arguments, Folse, representing Texas
Air and Eastern, said ``the complaint is supported by various
activities by the union.'' But, he said, the labor attorneys confuse
legal issues with social and political issues.
   At another point, Folse said, ``They were furious at Texas Air
acquiring EAL. ... They wanted to acquire it. ... They told EAL, `We
want to own your route, your passengers. If you don't (sell) it to
us, we're going to run you into the ground.'''
   David Ross, a Miami attorney also representing Texas Air, said
some of the statements made by union employees attacking Eastern's
safety procedures are actionable under law.
   The suit claims compensatory damages of $500 million and asks
that the amount be tripled under the Racketeering Act. The suit also
asks $1 billion in punitive damages.

   Federal banking regulations to protect against
discrimination in home mortgage lending are being ``pervasively
disregarded,'' a practice that has led to a nationwide pattern of
discrimination against blacks and Hispanics, a congressional critic
charged Monday.
   ``It is painfully clear that the federal regulatory agencies have
not used their legal authority to ensure that every American citizen
has equal opportunity to secure credit in order to own a home,''
said Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass.
   Kennedy, joined by House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, pointed to data from the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution under the
Freedom of Information Act and published in Sunday's editions.
   Statistics from 10 million loan applications from 1983 to
mid-1988 showed the rate of rejection for white applicants at the
3,100 savings and loans nationwide was 11.1 percent, while the
rejection rate for blacks was 23.7 percent and 18.2 percent for
Hispanics. In Boston, the rejection rate for whites was 9.1 percent,
but 26.5 percent for blacks.
   Industry officials say the data does not prove racial
discrimination because it does not take into account applicants'
income, debt burdens, credit histories and other information that
impact on mortgage lending.
   ``While it does signal that the regulators ought to look at this,
it does not really show evidence of discrimination itself,'' said
Mark Clark of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
   Kennedy conceded there could be factors other than race that
account for the rejection rate differences, but added, ``I don't
believe anybody with reasonable judgment would come to that
conclusion.''
   The congressman, a member of the House Banking Committee,
disclosed the Justice Department has had the raw data, plus an
institution-by-institution breakdown, for two years but has taken no
legal action. Kennedy called for prosecution under the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Community Reinvestment
Act.
   ``Those who overtly discriminate should be prosecuted, and the
financial institutions who tolerate a racially biased lending
program should be exposed and punished under the law,'' he said.
   Justice Department spokesman Mark Weaver said prosecutors
received the raw data from the Home Loan Bank Board two years ago,
but that the investigation was put ``on the back burner'' because
prosecutors were unable to make sense of the computerized statistics.
   ``I'm told that the tape was of absolutely no use to us,'' Weaver
said. ``They spent a lot of time working with our computer experts
and speaking with people at the Home Loan Bank Board. The numbers
weren't making sense. ... Faced with a large amount of raw data that
was not in a coherent format, that project was put on hold.''
   Weaver, who stressed the inquiry was initiated by the Justice
Department as part of ``routine monitoring,'' said prosecutors
reopened the mortgage discrimination investigation in July following
stories in the Journal-Constitution. But the probe is limited to
Atlanta-area lending institutions. He declined comment on the
possibility of a nationwide investigation in light of the new
information.
   Kennedy and Gonzalez attacked the Home Loan Bank Board for not
taking action on what the congressmen said were clear patterns of
discrimination, and they criticized the other federal bank
regulating agencies for failing to keep such statistics altogether.
   ``We do not accuse the federal regulators of bigotry or racial
bias. But discrimination is an insidious evil, and we must be active
and vigilant in our efforts to fight against it,'' Kennedy said.
``Passive tolerance of discrimination is just as harmful in its
effect as outright bias.''
   David Barr, a spokesman for the Home Loan Bank Board, said an
agency official is analyzing the data in the wake of the
Journal-Constitution story.
   Told of the congressional criticism that the agency should have
analyzed the information on its own, spotted the differences in
races and taken action, Barr said: ``That could be a valid point,
but you could also say that about some other statistical information
that the Bank Board is not analyzing.'' He cited a lack of resources
to do such analyses.
   Gonzalez endorsed and vowed to push through a Kennedy-drafted
bill that would require commercial banks and mortgage companies in
addition to savings and loans to report mortgage applications and
rejections by racial categories. It also would extend race
disclosures to commercial loans for small businesses.
   In addition, the legislation would require the regulatory
agencies to analyze the data and make it public. The Home Loan Bank
Board collects the race-based information, but has never analyzed
it. That was done by the newspaper.
   ``Those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear from this
legislation,'' Kennedy said at a news conference. ``But those who
deny credit on the basis of race or national orgin had better watch
out.''

<HEAD>Time Inc. Forms Direct Response Book Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Publishing giant Time Inc. said Monday it was
combining the operations of two of its units that sell books, music
and video products directly to the public.
   The new division will be called Time Inc. Books Direct, which
Time said will be one of the largest direct marketers of information
and entertainment products with more than 6 million active customers.
   The new unit will combine the operations of Book-of-the-Month
Club, which operates the nation's oldest book club, with those of
Time-Life Books, the largest direct marketer of continuity book,
music and video products.
   Last year, the companies that will make up Time Inc. Books Direct
shipped about 45 million book, music and video titles to customers
throughout the world, according to Kelso Sutton, president and
chairman of Time Inc. Books.
   Sutton said the direct response unit would account for more than
half of Time Inc.'s book revenues in 1988, which he estimated at
about $900 million.
   Christopher T. Linen, president and chief executive of Time-Life
Books, will become president and chief executive of the new unit,
reporting to Sutton.
   Lawrence M. Crutcher, president and chief executive of
Book-of-the-Month Club, will report to Linen. John M. Fahey Jr.,
formerly executive vice president and chief operating officer of
Time-Life Books, will be president and chief executive of Time-Life
Books, also reporting to Linen.
   Sutton said the combination ``offers a great many opportunities
for marketing synergies and for exchanging technical and creative
expertise that can benefit these very healthy businesses.''
   He said the combination will also allow coordinated customer
information and list management, more efficient media buying,
greater purchasing flexibility and economy in inventory management,
warehousing and distribution.
   In addition to the direct response book unit, Time Inc.'s book
operations include Little, Brown and Co., a trade and professional
book publisher; Scott, Foresman and Co., an educational publisher;
and Oxmoor House, a regional publisher.

<HEAD>Sears To Close Four Catalog Centers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said Monday it planned to
close four merchandise centers over the next 18 months, leaving the
huge retailer with six sites to distribute catalog goods.
   ``The net result will be better distribuition effeciencies,
improved service to the customer and increased support for each of
our individual businesses,'' Michael Bozic, chairman and executive
officer of Sears' merchandising arm.
   The Atlanta and Minneapolis distribution centers will be closed
in January 1990, he said.
   Portions of the Philadelphia and Memphis, Tenn., centers will be
used as warehouses to replenish Sears retail stores, Bozic said.
   In addition, the Greensboro, N.C., center will expand to handle
catalog merchandise distribution.
   The number of jobs affected was not disclosed, but the Atlanta
and Minneapolis centers have a total of 800 full-time employees and
950 part-time workers.
   Three other centers _ Chicago, Boston and Seattle _ have closed
in the past two years.
