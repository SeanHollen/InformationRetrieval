   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno has emerged as the
most likely candidate to succeed scandal-tainted Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita, who will resign soon, news reports said Saturday.
   Party leaders said Uno emerged as the top contender after talks
Friday between Takeshita and Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the party's
policy-making Executive Council, according to reports in the
mass-circulation Asahi, Yomiuri and Mainichi newspapers.
   Takeshita was scheduled to meet with party Secretary-General
Shintaro Abe Saturday afternoon to discuss the selection of Uno,
the reports said.
   Uno, 66, a 10-term member of the powerful lower house, has
served as foreign minister under Takeshita since 1987. He has held
the international trade and industry portfolio and served as party
deputy secretary-general.
   An official at Uno's office said the reports about his being top
contender were rumors and refused further comment. Takeshita's
office was closed Saturday.
   Party leaders reportedly favor Uno because he is untainted by
the Recruit scandal, which already has led to more than a dozen
arrests, and has experience in foreign affairs.
   Opposition to Uno remains, however, as he is a leading member of
the party faction headed by Takeshita's predecessor, Yasuhiro
Nakasone, who earlier this week was forced to testify about his
links to the scandal before parliament.
   Ito's refusal May 13 to take the top job created a leadership
vacuum in a governing party desperately in need of a leader with a
clean enough reputation to steer the party out of scandal.
   The Recruit Co., a publishing conglomerate at the center of the
scandal, is accused of trying to influence government policy by
selling underpriced, unlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary
and by doling out millions of dollars of political donations.
   Along with Takeshita's resignation, the scandal has led to the
downfall of three Cabinet ministers and the arrest of a former
chief Cabinet secretary. Many governing party members have called
it the worst crisis since the party was founded 34 years ago.
   In the meeting with Ito on Friday, Takeshita agreed to stay on
as prime minister until a successor is found, though on April 25 he
vowed to leave office soon after the year's budget clears
parliament. The budget package is due to become law on Sunday.
   The head of the governing party routinely serves as prime
minister because of the party's large majority in both houses of
parliament.
   But due to the current crisis, the Liberal Democrats are
reportedly considering installing separate individuals in the two
posts _ thus placating party elders who fear they may lose power if
a young prime minister is named.
   The reports said a possible combination is former Prime Minister
Takeo Fukuda, 84, who would assume the party presidency, and Uno as
premier.
   Fukuda, now in Washington D.C., said Friday said a younger man
should be chosen for prime minister. He is to return to Japan
Sunday. Ito also cited his age and poor health as reasons for
declining the job.
   Other names that have come up in the leadership race are lower
house speaker Michita Sakaka, 72, former Deputy Prime Minister Shin
Kanemaru, 74, and Masaharu Gotoda, 74, who heads the party
Political Reform Committee.

   Hardliners moved to tighten their control of
China on Friday after moderate Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang
was stripped of his power and placed under house arrest.
   Students leading the demonstrations that have forced the power
struggle continued to occupy Beijing's Tiananmen Square one week
after martial law was declared in Beijing. But thousands could be
seen leaving, and crowds dwindled to about 15,000.
   Despite the drop and the apparent ouster of Zhao, who had been
more conciliatory toward the protesters, students vowed to continue
to press for social reforms and the resignation of hard-line
Premier Li Peng.
   The protesters previously have demonstrated the ability to rally
huge numbers of citizens on short notice.
   Communist Party members nationwide were studying two sets of
documents as the Central Committee prepared to meet. One document
blamed Zhao for the 6-week-old student movement and the other
called for a ``resolute suppression of the disturbances,'' sources
said.
   Zhao had expressed sympathy for the student movement, was the
first to call it ``patriotic'' and apparently worked behind the
scenes to oppose the May 20 declaration of martial law in Beijing.
   But sources said conservatives accused Zhao of splitting the
party, instigating disturbances, revealing party secrets,
corruption and taking credit for achievements of senior leader Deng
Xiaoping during the past decade.
   On state-run news Wednesday night, Li was quoted as saying that
Deng ``is the main reformer in China, not anyone else.''
   Although Deng ushered in market-oriented economic reforms,
student protesters have been pressing for political freedoms, such
as a free press, and an end to official profiteering. Millions have
taken to the streets in recent weeks to call for the resignation of
Li and Deng, who are more resistant to social reforms than is Zhao.
   Li was quoted Friday in the state-run press as calling on
soldiers surrounding Beijing to conduct ``a resolute struggle
against the plots of a small minority.''
   Eastern European and Chinese sources said Zhao was stripped of
power Wednesday night during a meeting of top government officials
and was under house arrest.
   The party's Central Committee would have to ratify any
leadership change. It is expected to meet soon.
   Sources said officials who have worked under Zhao on political
and economic reforms also were facing punishment. They include the
party's propaganda chief, Hu Qili; Vice Premier Tian Jiyun; and Bao
Tong, a Zhao aide.
   They said the main winner in the struggle appeared to be Deng,
84, who apparently was behind Li's imposition of martial law and is
believed to still have final say on major decisions.
   Students by the thousands were leaving Tiananmen Square, the
focus of two weeks of continuous demonstrations. By nightfall
Friday, about 15,000 students remained on the vast expanse that
once was occupied by more than 100,000.
   Students insist the drop in numbers does not mean their movement
lost momentum or was cowed. A few students admitted they feared
violence now that the conservatives seem to be in control, but most
said they were tired of sleeping on concrete in unsanitary
conditions.
   Student leaders said they were urging non-Beijing students to go
home because they can do more in spreading the movement there than
by staying on the square.
   The leaders expressed confidence they could again quickly
mobilize large groups of students and residents if the
confrontation with authorities escalated.
   The main train station was packed with students returning home.
The television news quoted a station official as estimating 20,000
were leaving Friday.
   But some said they would not leave.
   ``Everybody in the country is watching the square,'' said one
student leader. ``If we leave, we will betray their hopes.''
   On Friday, more government leaders embraced Li's hard-line
stance.
   Chen Yun, the 84-year-old head of the Central Advisory
Commission, a powerful advisory group, appeared on TV to support
martial law and the commission later followed suit.
   A government source said Li Xiannian, 81, who formerly held the
ceremonial post of president, spoke at the meeting where the
decision was made to strip Zhao of power.
   He criticized Zhao for fomenting the student movement and
equating it with ``a struggle between two army headquarters.'' Such
a description indicated conservatives view the general secretary's
alleged crimes as serious.
   That speech and one given by China's 81-year-old President Yang
Shangkun made up one of the documents being studied by top party
members and officers, said a government source.
   Yang said Zhao's actions ``had a very bad effect'' on the
nation, the source said, and indicated that party members,
intellectuals and journalists who participated in the movement
would be punished.

   Tony Coelho, the third-ranking Democrat in the
House, began his political career with advice from comedian Bob
Hope.
   Coelho was raised on a dairy farm near Fresno, Calif. In college
at Loyola University, he discovered he had epilepsy and was turned
down for his first career _ the Catholic priesthood.
   But Hope's wife, Dolores, heard about Coelho's situation and the
comedian suggested that Coelho try politics. Coelho came to
Washington, where he worked for Rep. B.F. Sisk, the 15th District's
congressman, for 15 years.
   When Sisk retired in 1978, Coelho ran for his seat and won.
Three years later, shortly after Ronald Reagan was elected
president, he took over as chairman of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee and proved to be a master at raising money.
   After the 1986 election, Coelho was picked as majority whip, the
third-ranking position.

   President Bush arrived Friday enroute to a summit
with NATO leaders, hoping to use personal diplomacy to resolve a
long-simmering dispute over European-based nuclear weapons.
   In brief arrival remarks, Bush made no reference to reports that
he would use the NATO summit next week in Brussels _ his first as
president _ to announce a reduction in U.S. troops in Europe.
   Instead, he declared the United States wants a ``stronger and
more united Europe,'' and said he plans to be ``actively engaged in
Eastern Europe, promoting measures to encourage political and
economic liberalization in Poland.''
   Bush plans to visit Poland in July.
   The dispute over short-range nuclear weapons has defied
resolution by the two main countries at odds _ West Germany,
pressing for negotiations with the Soviets to rid Europe of such
weapons, and the United States, supported by Britain, wanting to
keep the weapons there and make them better.
   Other members of the 16-nation NATO alliance have lined up on
one side or the other, with a few stradding the fence.
   Officials on all sides have sought to dismiss suggestions that
the issue would seriously disrupt the summit, which was designed to
celebrate 40 years of Cold War unity against the Soviet Union.
   As Bush left Washington, The Washington Times reported that he
planned to use the summit as the stage for announcing a reduction
of up to 10 percent in U.S. troop strength in Europe, ``as many as
34,000 troops.''
   The Washington Post quoted sources in Saturday's editions as
saying the administration is considering an offer to negotiate cuts
in troop strength, aircraft and helicopters in Europe if the Soviet
Union agrees to cuts in tanks, armored personnel carriers and
artillery pieces.
   Numerous administration officials, with Bush and back in
Washington, said any word on that would have to come from the
president himself.
   Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters aboard Air Force
One en route to Rome: ``Any ideas in this area would be one the
president would want to discuss with the allies, he would raise
with his partners at this session before he discusses anything
publicly. ... I am not confirming or denying any decisions.''
   Fitzwater did not dispute the newspaper's account. He said Bush
``will be discussing a lot of different ideas with the allies'' but
that he ``just can't speculate on what the conversations might
amount to or what the president might suggest.''
   The White House spokesman also stressed Bush would make no move
on troop deployments in Europe without having consultations with
NATO first.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, told CBS News that 10 percent ``is the probable amount
of reduction that would occur if the Soviet Union accepted the NATO
proposal on conventional arms control which is now tabled.''
   In Bonn, West German spokesman Herbert Schmuelling said, ``We
have no official word of such a decision.''
   Bush, in comments just before leaving on his first trip to
Europe as president, expressed hopes to see a Europe ``that is
truly free, united and at peace.'' He repeated his desire to move
beyond any Cold War policy of containment ``to integrate the Soviet
Union into the community of nations.''
   ``We welcome the political and economic liberalization that has
taken place so far in the Soviet Union and in some countries of
Eastern Europe. We watch hoping that more changes will follow.''
   As for the Western military alliance, he said, ``NATO has been a
success by any measure but success breeds its own challenges.
Today, dramatic changes are taking place in Europe, East and West.
For us, those changes bring new challenges and unparalleled
opportunities.''
   In remarks prepared for his arrival in Rome, he praised
U.S.-Italy ties of friendship and said, ``The United States
welcomes a stronger and more united Europe.''
   Several weeks of busy diplomacy, including a high-level meeting
in Bonn and two others in Washington, failed to settle the missiles
issue, a subject that Secretary of State James A. Baker III called
``extraordinarily important.''
   The issue is whether the United States and the Soviet Union
should negotiate to reduce and possibly eliminate all the
short-range nuclear missiles NATO and the Warsaw Pact have deployed
on European soil or delay indefinitely while the two military
alliances negotiate over reductions in troops, tanks, artillery and
other conventional armories.
   Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher insist that
NATO's missiles, which they want to make more powerful, are vital
to the defense of the alliance. West Germany and its supporters
contend a series of moves by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to reduce nuclear and non-nuclear weapons reduce the missiles'
significance.
   The dispute has symbolic as well as strategic facets. It
reflects, on the one hand, a a determination by the Bush
administration to stick to its position, and on the other the
emergence of West Germany from post-World War II acquiescence to
the United States in NATO affairs.
   ``It should not be resolved at all costs,'' Baker said while
predicting the missile issue would not dominate the summit next
Monday and Tuesday in Brussels.
   Until the dispute boiled over, Bush and the White House staff
were planning on a calm presidential visit to friendly countries
where he could step serenely through a series of picture-taking
events. He will visit West Germany and Britain as well as Italy and
Belgium.
   That schedule remains intact, though the missile dispute
probably will require some clever draftmanship to paper over the
differences in a windup NATO communique that stresses Western
solidarity.
   In Italy, besides talking with Italian government leaders, Bush
will meet with Pope John Paul II on Saturday in Rome and attend
Roman Catholic mass and a Memorial Day ceremony in an American
cemetery in Nettuno, on the seacost 39 miles south of the capital,
on Sunday. Bush is an Episcopalian.
   After te two-day NATO meeting in Brussels, the president will
continue his discussions with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in
Bonn on Wednesday over dinner in a ballroom where Mozart's ``Magic
Flute'' opera premiered in 1793 and on a riverboat cruise on the
Rhine.
   In London on Thursday Bush will have the comfort of winding up
his travels meeting with his strongest supporter in the alliance,
Mrs. Thatcher, at 10 Downing Street, and lunch with Queen Elizabeth
II at Buckingham Palace.
   Then, on Friday, Bush flies to Maine for a weekend off.

   Making the racy tabloids pay large sums for libel
to pals of royalty and other notables is one thing, but an award of
nearly $1 million to the Yorkshire Ripper's wife is provoking
comment that things have gone too far.
   ``Whose justice is this?'' the Daily Mirror asked on Thursday.
``Preposterous,'' declared the Daily Express.
   The 600,000-pound ($942,000) award Wednesday to Sonia Sutcliffe
was the largest ever made by a British jury. Her husband, Peter, is
known as the Yorkshire Ripper for terrorizing northern England in
1975-80 with the murders of 13 women.
   It was levied against Private Eye, a satirical magazine that has
thrived on the notoriety of frequent libel cases. The
200,000-circulation magazine, which is partly owned by
actor-comedian Peter Cook, has begun a fund-raising campaign to
avoid bankruptcy.
   Private Eye said in 1981 and 1983 that Mrs. Sutcliffe had sold
her story to the Daily Mail for $392,000 after carousing with the
tabloid's reporters at a hotel. After she filed the libel action,
Private Eye published two articles implying she knew about her
husband's crimes.
   In the trial, which began May 19, Private Eye admitted there was
no deal with the Daily Mail but claimed the gist of its statements
was true: that Mrs. Sutcliffe negotiated with newspapers and was
prepared to capitalize on her husband's crimes.
   Legal experts said the growth of libel awards would make
newspapers reluctant to defend stories in court, for fear of high
jury awards, and incline them to out-of-court settlements even on
statements that were true.
   They and several national newspapers recommended changes in the
libel laws, which allow juries to set damages without guidance from
judges. In no other area of English civil law do juries have such
great discretionary power.
   Plaintiffs in libel suits don't ask for a specific sum,
preferring not to limit the jury.
   ``In England, you are now going down the American route, which
would allow punitive damages,'' said Ross Harper, president of the
Law Society of Scotland. In Scotland's judicial system, judges
assess libel damages.
   ``Damages are there to compensate, not to punish,'' Harper said.
``We could suffer from all the deficiencies and defects of the
American system which allow punitive damages to come in. They are
unfair, they are inconsistent.''
   Lord Blom-Cooper, chairman of the watchdog Press Council, agreed
that ``the assessment of damages should be left to judges.''
   John Wakeham, Conservative majority leader, told the House of
Commons on Thursday the government was considering changes in the
libel laws, but he was not specific.
   Newspapers said that if Mrs. Sutcliffe, 38, died before her
husband, he would inherit the remainder of the award. Sutcliffe is
in a hospital for the criminally insane.
   In it's editorial, the Daily Mirror said: ``The Yorkshire Ripper
has claimed his 14th victim _ justice.''
   The Daily Express said the award made ``a mockery not only of
the libel laws but of the system of justice itself.''
   ``Mrs. Sutcliffe was right to fight for her reputation if she
believed it maligned, but how on earth could a jury seriously
believe that it was damaged to the extent of 600,000 pounds
tax-free?'' the editorial said.
   ``As this award now sets a new record for libel damages, the
jury must have thought the wrong done to her good name was the most
grievous ever considered by our courts. In reality, it probably
thought nothing of the kind.''
   Mrs. Sutcliffe has not commented on the award. Her lawyer, Kerry
Macgill, said Thursday: ``Sonia Sutcliffe wasn't the person
convicted. She is an entirely separate entity.''
   The previous record for libel damages by a jury was $800,000
awarded to novelist and former politician Jeffrey Archer in July
1987 after the Star reported he had a sexual liaison with a
prostitute and paid her hush money.
   American actress Koo Stark received $480,000 from the Sunday
People last year because of false allegations that she dated Prince
Andrew after her marriage.
   Newspaper publisher Robert Maxwell won $77,000 damages in 1986
from Private Eye, which said he financed overseas trips by Labor
leader Neil Kinnock in hopes of receiving a peerage from a future
Labor government.
   Pop star Elton John got received $1.6 million from the Sun,
Britain's largest-circulation newspaper, which admitted its lurid
allegations about his private life were false.
   That action was settled out of court in December. The judge
scheduled to hear the case accused both sides of milking it for
publicity.

   The sleeping deputies, docile votes and fulsome
tributes to leaders are gone. In their place is vigorous, emotional
debate with the sound of a political and moral reawakening in this
vast land.
   Freed from the fear that permeated decades of authoritarian
rule, citizens chose delegates to the Soviet Union's first
competitively elected parliament.
   They hoped for change, and got it.
   As soon as the new Congress of People's Deputies convened on
Thursday, deputy Vilens Tolpozhnikov of independent-minded Latvia
took the floor. He requested a moment of silence for the 20 people
killed last month when security forces broke up a peaceful
nationalist demonstration in Tbilisi, Georgia.
   His appeal set the tone for a surging debate that expressed the
feelings of of a diverse country that has spent four years under
Mikhail S. Gorbachev probing its past and rediscovering politics,
ethnic identities and national morality.
   ``Each of us wants to talk out a sea of emotion,'' deputy
Konstantin D. Lubenchenko said.
   Symbolizing the change, one of the first to take the floor was
Andrei D. Sakharov, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate who only 2{
years ago was an internal exile confined to Gorky.
   Gorbachev made one of his most passionate speeches in response
to tough questions about his privileges as leader, his position on
ethnic conflicts and his plans for the future.
   ``We are still learning democracy,'' he said. ``We are still
forming a political culture. We understand with our brains that
it's necessary to change, but the system doesn't let us.''
   ``We have now reached the most difficult stage of perestroika,''
he said, referring to his ``restructuring'' program of economic and
social change.
   A leader of his energy and candor could hardly be imagined in
the days of such lumbering, silent figures as Leonid I. Brezhnev,
who even had himself given the nation's top literature prize in a
campaign of self-glorification now openly reviled in Soviet media.
   On Thursday, young and businesslike deputies unseen in
Brezhnev's time took the microphone to argue with conviction and
detail.
   There was a sense of shame about the past, an earnest desire not
to repeat the tragic mistakes.
   ``It's difficult for us all to live,'' said Valentina Petrovna,
a deputy from Irkutsk in Siberia. ``Let's think hard, and not allow
anybody to restructure the restructuring.''
   Vladimir Yavorivsky, a writer from Kiev, declared ``this will be
the last time'' the Soviet people will allow a president to be
elected without democratic opposition.
   Without change, he said, ``the people will turn away from us.
They will go back to silence, to vodka and to their anecdotes.''
   Five years ago, those were among the few comforts for citizens
who watched a closed, secretive Kremlin choose the elderly,
obviously infirm Konstantin U. Chernenko to replace the deceased
Yuri V. Andropov as Communist Party leader.
   Chernenko pulled the country out of the 1984 Los Angeles
Olympics, backed off arms control negotiations with the United
States and turned away from the tentative reforms begun by Andropov.
   Deputies in the new parliament said the Soviet Union's standing
in the world has been restored by what one called ``brilliant
successes'' in diplomacy.
   Then they contrasted that with the performance at home: a rising
budget deficit, continuing shortages, social tensions and speeches
that lack the bold tone of the early Gorbachev period.
   A deputy from Kharkov warned Gorbachev not to act like the
``great Napoleon who, fearing neither bullets nor death, led his
people to victory, but due to sycophants and his wife ended with an
empire, and not the republic he started with.''

<HEAD>Ag Expert Says low Mississippi River Could Trap Barges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department transportation
expert says the Mississippi River has not recovered from last
year's drought and its reduced streamflow could bottleneck barges
moving grain and soybeans into export this fall.
   T.Q. Hutchinson of the department's Economic Research Service
said a sharp upturn in demand for jumbo covered railroad cars and
``continued low-water conditions on the Missouri and lower
Mississippi rivers will create a tight transportation situation for
grain marketing.''
   However, Hutchinson said there will be ``sufficient capacity''
available to meet the current export forecasts for feed grains and
wheat.
   ``Replacement of Lock 26 at Alton, Ill., will close the
Mississippi River for about one week in October-November 1989,'' he
said. ``The closing, combined with low water and a tight rail car
supply, could limit a post-harvest upturn in export shipments, but
should not markedly disrupt grain distribution.''
   Hutchinson said in a report that water levels for the lower
Mississippi in the first four months of this year were well below
those of the same period in 1988. However, the January-April levels
averaged above those of the 1988 drought months, June through
December.
   ``Navigation on the middle and lower segments of the river will
probably remain impaired in 1989, as in 1988,'' he said. ``However,
sufficient capacity exists to carry the volume of grain implied by
current marketing estimates.''
   Hutchinson said that between 1944 and 1988 the flood measure at
St. Louis, Mo., averaged 19.5 feet in April, falling to between 6
and 9 feet in September. Thus, he added, ``a substantial reduction
in water depth can be expected to occur between spring and fall.''
   Last year, the water level at St. Louis fell from 15.1 feet in
April to 0.4 feet in September. The gauges do not indicate the
channel's depth, but measure the quantity of water available.
Channel depths are affected by dredging and other activities.
   In April, Hutchinson said, the flood gauges at St. Louis
averaged 13.5 feet, nearly two feet below the previous year and six
feet below the 1944-88 average for the month.
   ``In the coming months, flood gauges will likely reflect
decreasing amounts of water, as they did last year,'' he said.
``Much of this will result from continuing low flows from the
Missouri River.''
   Last year the Missouri River supplied 65 to 70 percent of the
flow at St. Louis, he said. Normally, the Missouri would account
for 45 percent. Although water releases in 1988 were below average,
the Missouri's increased share of the flow stemmed from reductions
in the Mississippi and its tributaries.
   ``Currently, Missouri River reservoirs are 50 percent to 60
percent full,'' Hutchinson said. ``The Missouri River division (of
the) U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to release slightly more
water than last year _ but less than in a normal year.''
   Also, he said, the Corps of Engineers plans a shortened
navigation season this year because of the low levels of storage
reservoirs. The river opened one week later and will close 25 to 30
days earlier than usual.

   Retail food prices in 1989 have been pushed up
sharply by crop-biting cold weather in the first quarter and may
gain an average of 5 percent to 7 percent over the entire year,
according to an Agriculture Department forecast.
   That would compare with a 1988 average gain of 4.1 percent and
would be the sharpest 12-month increase since 1981, when retail
food prices rose 7.9 percent.
   ``Consumer demand will pull up food prices in 1989,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said Thursday. ``While
growth in the general economy is slowing, growth in real disposable
personal income is still likely to be 2 percent to 3 percent this
year, after rising 2.9 percent last year.''
   The report said the Labor Department's consumer price index for
food increased at an annual rate of 8.6 percent in the first three
months of 1989, well above the rate expected last fall.
   ``Additional upward adjustments are likely for the rest of this
year, based primarily on the strength of consumer demand and the
impact of higher petroleum prices,'' the report said.
   Much of the sharp rise in the first quarter was blamed on cold
weather in Mexico, Florida and California which cut supplies of
fresh vegetables. Retail prices, which had been expected to decline
during the quarter, rose an average of 5.7 percent.
   Other price increases in the first quarter resulted from
lingering effects of last summer's drought.
   ``Processed vegetable prices continued to rise because of
smaller supplies of canned sweet corn, green peas, snap beans and
dry beans, all victims of the drought,'' the report said. ``Smaller
supplies of canned vegetables forced frozen vegetable prices higher
as well.''
   Retail egg prices rose 29.5 percent compared to a year earlier.
Production was cut back because of high, drought-related feed
costs, the report said.
   Food price increases are expected to be more moderate in the
remainder of 1989. Prices for meats, poultry and fish ``will remain
reasonably stable for the rest of the year,'' the report said. Egg
prices are expected to fluctuate but should remain well above
year-earlier levels.

   The Agriculture Department says private
exporters have sold China an additional 150,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat for delivery in the marketing year that will begin June 1.
   No selling prices or the names of the companies involved were
announced.
   Wheat sales to China in the current 1988-89 marketing year total
almost 8.3 million tons, officials said Thursday.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 150,000 tons would be about 5.5 million bushels and,
at recent prices of about $4.03 per bushel, would have a farm value
of around $22 million.

<HEAD>Desperately Seeking Scroll: Schumer Asks State Department Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The State Department needs to know more if
it's going to help find a sacred Jewish scroll that was being
smuggled from Iran to the United States when it was allegedly
seized by officials in the United Arab Emirates.
   ``Without more information, there's no way that the department,
which wants to be helpful, can be,'' a State Department official
said Thursday, speaking on condition that his name not be used.
``There just doesn't appear to be anywhere else to turn.''
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has asked the State Department to
help recover the 150-year-old Persian Torah, which had been
destined for a new Persian synagogue in Queens, N.Y.
   But the State Department has been unable to locate the holy
book, the man who was transporting it or the official who allegedly
confiscated the scroll in the tiny Arab emirate of Ras Alkheimeh.
   A spokesman for the Embassy of the United Arab Emirates did not
return several phone calls Thursday.
   The Torah's owner, an Iranian woman, asked a friend of her
husband in November 1988 to smuggle the sacred scroll to Dubai.
Iranian law prohibits exporting a Torah, according to Schumer.
   The woman was sending the Torah to her brother in Brooklyn,
N.Y., who was planning to donate it to synagogue Beit Knesset Omid.
   ``We were going to have a grand opening at the synagogue and I
was expecting to put this Torah at the grand opening,'' the brother
said in an interview from New York. He spoke on condition that his
name not be used for fear that the Iranian government might
retaliate against his family.
   The brother said the scroll had been in his family for
generations.
   ``The value of this Torah, if you are Jewish, is priceless,'' he
said.
   Schumer put its price in the tens of thousands of dollars if it
is indeed 150 years old.
   The smuggler took the scroll by boat from a port in southern
Iran to Dubai, where he planned to mail it to the United States,
Schumer said. But in Ras Alkheimeh, the courier was stopped by
government officials and the scroll was confiscated, Schumer said.
   In a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker, Schumer said
he has learned that the person who seized the Torah was Javad
Hadad, a member of the Justice-Police Department. Schumer provided
a phone number for Hadad, but there was no answer there Thursday.
   The State Department spokesman said the U.S. consul in Dubai had
tried to chase down Schumer's leads to no avail.
   ``That name has been given before but they have not been able to
track him down, as much as they've tried,'' the spokesman said.
``We're really at a stone wall right now.''
   Schumer blamed the Torah's alleged confiscation on Arab
anti-Semitism.
   ``It's a human rights issue,'' he said. ``I think they can be
embarrassed because this is the most vulgar kind of anti-Semitism
that could exist.''

<HEAD>World Affairs Are Getting Very Hard To Predict</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Throw away your crystal ball. It's a
topsy-turvy world. Events don't turn out the way you might have
supposed. Predictions aren't worth very much. Just look around.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a conservative, is in the
vanguard of West Europeans seeking disarmament and an accommodation
with the Soviet Union.
   He's resisted the blandishments of President Bush and disrupted
the script for the NATO summit meeting to be held Monday and
Tuesday in Brussels by demanding a negotiated reduction in
short-range nuclear missiles.
   Brave U.S. talk of a Western alliance able to withstand tensions
cannot obscure the fact that the usually reliable West Germans _
and not the independent French or a smaller left-leaning ally _
have opened a rift that challenges NATO's very reason for being.
   If the time has come to negotiate the elimination of battlefield
nuclear missiles in Europe because the Soviet threat has receded,
then NATO's purpose is due for a reassessment.
   Bush was going to Europe to celebrate the 40th anniversary of
the alliance. There still will be wall-to-wall photo-ops in
Brussels, but behind the scenes, diplomats will be up late trying
to paper over the U.S.-West German split with smiles and ambiguity.
   All in all, a strange turn of events. But not the only surprise
on the world stage.
   Down in Panama, despite hopeful U.S. predictions and a unanimous
indictment by the Organization of American States that he was
responsible for ``grave events and abuses,'' Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega clings to power, defying all efforts to dislodge him.
   More than a year ago, Elliott Abrams, then the U.S. assistant
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said Noriega was
``hanging by fingertips.'' The United States regarded ousted
Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle as the legitimate
authority.
   However, Delvalle's government ceased to exist 15 months ago,
and Noriega is in effective control of Panama. He evidently still
can depend on the military for support. Without the assistance of
the generals, apparently there is no way for Washington to force
Noriega's ouster.
   He is still there, defying the odds and the predictions.
   In Afghanistan, President Najibullah, scorned by the Reagan and
Bush administrations as Moscow's inept puppet, is still in power
without a single Russian soldier standing behind him.
   Rebels armed by the United States and Pakistan were supposed to
move in for the kill right after the Red Army withdrew. The troops
left in mid-February, but Najibullah remains in charge in Kabul.
   Could any seer have predicted only a few months ago the turmoil
sweeping China, the open defiance of generals ordered to move
against student protesters, the democratic slogans from a people
staggering under Marxist rule?
   That Poland would come to terms with the Catholic Church? That
Hungary would have a stock exchange? That the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini would retain his grip on Iran well into his 80s? That
Mikhail S. Gorbachev would end weapons shipments to Nicaragua?
   The Soviet leader, of course, has turned out to be the biggest
surprise of all. He is not what the United States had come to
expect from Moscow.
   Some 30 years ago Nikita Khrushchev, in a flurry of reform and
showmanship, upset the West's balance. Since his downfall in 1964,
the United States and its allies could count on a certain amount of
predictability.
   Until Gorbachev came along.
   He has kept the West off balance constantly. Ronald Reagan, who
had dismissed the Soviet Union as an ``evil empire,'' wound up
having five summit meetings with Gorbachev and signing a landmark
treaty to eliminate an entire category of U.S. and Soviet nuclear
missiles.
   George Bush apparently is still trying to figure out Gorbachev.
   The U.S. response to Soviet arms control initiatives has been
cautious.
   After all, there is no way of predicting what might happen next.

   Key events in student demonstrations:
   April 15 _ Former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang dies. Beijing
University students put up posters praising him and indirectly
criticizing opponents who forced his resignation after student
demonstrations in 1986_87.
   April 17 _ Thousands of students march in Beijing and Shanghai,
shouting ``Long live Hu Yaobang! Long live democracy!''
   April 27 _ More than 150,000 students, with wide support from
people on the street, surge past police lines and fill Tiananmen
Square, chanting slogans for democracy and freedom.
   April 29 _ Officials meet with student leaders, but independent
student groups are not satisfied and continue a class boycott at 41
universities.
   April 30 _ Beijing's Communist Party chief, Zhao Ziyang, meets
with student representatives.
   May 4 _ About 100,000 students and supporters march on Tiananmen
Square to celebrate the 70th anniversary of China's first student
movement. Demonstrations are held in Shanghai, Nanjing and other
cities. About 300 journalists protest outside the official Xinhua
News Agency.
   May 9 _ Journalists petition the government for press freedom.
   May 10 _ Thousands of students bicycle to major media offices in
a press freedom demonstration. Another protest is held in the
provincial capital of Taiyuan.
   May 13 _ About 2,000 students begin a hunger strike in Tiananmen
Square.
   May 14 _ Thousands flock to the square to back the students. The
number fasting rises to 3,000.
   May 15 _ The government deadline for students to leave the
square passes. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's welcoming
ceremony planned near the square must be moved to the airport.
   May 16 _ Hundreds of thousands occupy the square. Journalists
and intellectuals join the protest.
   May 17 _ Zhao pleas for students to leave. Students reject his
appeal and hold marches that generate 1 million supporters in
Beijing.
   May 18 _ About 1 million people, including many workers, again
take to the streets to show their support for the hunger strikers.
Li Peng issues a stern lecture to student leaders and refuses to
discuss their demands.

hardliners to compromise. Students resume their hunger strike, then
abandon it, saying they will need their strength for the struggle
ahead.
   May 21 _ Students claim to reject an order by Li Peng to leave
the Tiananman Square or face military action. Defying martial law,
hundreds of thousands of people remain in the square or block
intersections to prevent troops from reaching it.

and senior military leaders say they are resisting orders to order
their troops on the protesters. At least one military convoy is
reported to withdraw.
   May 23 _ One million people take to the streets to demonstrate
for democracy.
   May 25 _ Li makes his first appearance since declaring martial
law. State-run radio says 27 of 29 provinces support martial law,

<HEAD>House Panel Blasts Pierce for Housing Subsidy Program</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce
provoked anger and disbelief among members of a congressional panel
that questioned him about a housing subsidy program which
investigators say was riddled with favoritism.
   Pierce, who is now a New York lawyer, told congressional
investigators Thursday that he wasn't directly involved in deciding
which projects received grants under the program. He said a
committee of his subordinates at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development selected the winners, and his approval was a
rubber stamp.
   Pierce said he wasn't influenced by well-connected Republicans
and former HUD officials who obtained a large portion of the
multimillion dollar subsidy projects, acting as consultants or
developers.
   ``Perhaps we should have watched the program closer than we
did,'' Pierce said, in the closest he came to acknowledging any
blame. ``But we've got a whole department (to run) ....''
   Pierce's appearance before a House Government Operations
subcommittee marked his first public comment since an investigative
report sharply criticized the management of a HUD program that
provided indirect subsidies for rehabilitation of privately owned
low-income housing projects.
   Current HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has suspended further awards
under the program pending a review.
   Pierce, who headed HUD for eight years under former President
Reagan, testified that he recommended Congress kill the so-called
mod-rehab program.
   But his remarks stirred strong reaction among members of the
subcommittee, which questioned him for more than two hours.
   When Pierce suggested that Democrats had also profited from the
program, a near-shouting match erupted with Rep. Barney Frank. The
Massachusetts Democrat charged that Pierce was trying to ``deflect
some of the blame'' by making ``irresponsible statements'' he could
not back up.
   At one point during their exchange, Pierce said, ``I don't think
...'' and did not complete his sentence. Frank shot back, ``Well,
that has been clearer and clearer.''
   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., told Pierce the
suggestion that the Republican-appointed inspector general was
protecting Democrats was ``difficult to fathom.''
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., told Pierce that despite eight
years in the Cabinet job, his remarks suggested ``you don't really
today understand how this program works.''
   ``I did not have hands on,'' Pierce responded.
   HUD Inspector General Paul Adams said an audit he conducted
found a pattern in which former department officials and other
well-connected Republicans received an inordinately large share of
project awards. Among those cited was former Interior Secretary
James Watt, who was reported receiving a $300,000 consulting fee on
a Maryland project.
   Pierce acknowledged that department officials used their own
discretion in awarding subsidies, but said that was because
Congress in 1984 waived requirements specifying fair-share
allocation procedures.
   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., read from a memo
that he said the inspector general sent Pierce in 1988 warning him
of problems in the program.
   Pierce said by then he had altered the selection process. He
said he did not respond to the inspector general's suggestion
because those changes needed time to work.
   ``The inspector general is not God,'' Pierce said.
   Rep. Margaret Roukema, R-N.J., and the subcommittee's chairman,
Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., expressed surprise at Pierce's reaction
to Adams' memo _ which Lantos called ``a very, very dramatic
recommendation.''
   Pierce responded that he did not remember the memo, and added,
``Well, there were a lot of fights going on.''
   Pierce said he met with Watt on the Maryland project but
referred him to the appropriate office at HUD and told him that
``we'd look very carefully at his project.''
   ``No promises were made to him,'' Pierce said.

<HEAD>Democrats Want To Be Ready To Move Foley Into Wright's Job Quickly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats, anticipating a historic
resignation next week of Speaker Jim Wright, are making plans for
quickly promoting Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley of Washington to
the powerful speaker's post.
   But intrigue is brewing for filling in the rest of the party
leadership slots as some Democrats worry that Rep. Tony Coelho,
Foley's likely successor, could hurt the party because of questions
about his own financial dealings.
   Foley, talking with reporters Thursday in Seattle, said he spoke
to Wright earlier in the day and the speaker ``repeated his desire
to have an opportunity to state his case, his side of the case, to
the widest possible audience, and he's determined to take that
opportunity at the first time that seems appropriate.''
   ``I assume that will be with either next week or shortly
thereafter,'' Foley said.
   Leadership sources in the Capitol said arrangements were being
made for Wright to make a resignation address to the House next
Wednesday, but the speaker himself had not yet decided on his
precise course of action.
   Wright, D-Texas, remained secluded in his office Thursday, but
he released a statement making clear he no longer was seeking any
``plea bargain'' with the House ethics committee.
   One of the most serious charges made by the ethics committee was
that Wright's wife, Betty, was given a no-work job by Wright's
friend and business partner, George Mallick. House rules prohibit
gifts from people with interest in legislation, and the committee
said it believed Mallick, a Fort Worth developer, had an interest.
   Wright, who has vowed to clear his wife's name, dispatched his
attorneys on Wednesday in search of a deal that would accomplish
that, according to sources who said the lawyers offered his
resignation in exchange for the panel dropping at least the charges
that involve his wife.
   But the deal fell through as Republicans and at least one
Democrat on the panel resisted.
   Wright on Thursday distanced himself from the effort and
indicated it was over.
   ``There is no deal now. There will be no deal in the future,''
he said in the statement, insisting he had never personally engaged
in the discussions.
   It remained unclear whether Wright, if he resigned his
speakership, would at the same time resign his seat in the House or
if that would happen soon thereafter. The ethics committee would be
forced to abandon its case only if Wright left the House.
   If Wright resigns his speakership, his party would quickly
caucus to fill his post and the House presumably would elect the
popular Foley, the No. 2 House Democrat.
   If Foley moved up to speaker, his post of majority leader would
become vacant.
   Coelho, D-Calif., would be next in line. However, Coelho
recently admitted that he failed to include on his financial
disclosure forms a $50,000 bank loan that he used toward purchasing
junk bonds.
   On Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported the Justice
Department is conducting a preliminary criminal investigation of
whether Coelho received favors from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
the firm that issued the junk bond.
   After the troubles surrounding Wright, some lawmakers were
privately promoting Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., for the majority
leader's post. Gephardt and Coelho are political allies, but the
Missouri Democrat did not rule out such a run.
   Gephardt press spokesman Deborah Johns said her boss is
``waiting to see what the speaker is going to do. He's listening to
people and at this time he just hasn't made a decision.''
   Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., also was being mentioned for a
leadership spot. Contenders lining up for Coelho's No. 3 whip's
spot, should he try to move up, included Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich., the current chief deputy whip, and Democratic Caucus
Chairman Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa.
   The politicking was taking place quietly.
   ``There's a certain amount of inappropriateness in mounting a
campaign before the funeral,'' quipped Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont.
   Some Democrats were distressed at the turn of events, with the
speaker seemingly being forced out before the ethics committee even
moved into the phase of its proceedings during which Wright could
testify and make his case.
   ``My heart is so heavy that this could happen to the House of
Representatives,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who in 1986
ran unsuccessfully for whip.
   Rangel said he was especially bothered by those members who have
called for Wright's resignation because he is embarrassing the
House.
   ``I was outraged because, hell, there's nothing wrong with
embarrassing other members of the damned House,'' he said heatedly.
``I just can't think how you'd ask someone to damage the office and
walk away from it without fighting like hell.''

   Eighty people died from rabies in the eastern
China province of Shandong during the first three months of this
year, an official daily said today.
   The China Daily quoted a local health official as saying 539
people in the province died from rabies last year.
   The official said there are now 6 million dogs in Shandong
despite a ban on keeping dogs in its urban areas. He said
anti-rabies vaccine is scarce in many rural areas where dogs are
allowed, and many bite victims cannot receive treatment in time.
   There are no national figures for rabies victims. Health
officials in southern Guangdong province earlier reported 566
deaths from rabies in 1987 and 1988.

<TEXT>
   A Nobel laureate said Thursday that none
of the scientists who spent three days discussing experiments on
room-temperature fusion believes the research is a key to creating
energy.
   However, Robert J. Schrieffer said, chemists and physicists are
finally talking to each other and are forming collaborations to
work together on various cold fusion projects.
   The Workshop on Cold Fusion Phenomenon, attended by 440
researchers from 14 nations, concluded Thursday without reaching a
consensus other than that researchers have a lot of work to do.
   Physicists, chemists, engineers and other scientists wrangled
over the conclusions reached in numerous experiments performed in
the two months since University of Utah researchers announced they
had produced nuclear fusion in a jar.
   The debate centers over the phenomenon of excess heat reported
by the Utah researchers and the subsequent discovery of nuclear
fusion indicators, such as neutrons, reported by other scientists
trying to verify the Utah work.
   No one has reported both heat and nuclear particles, leading
some to conclude that the Utah experiment did not produce cold
fusion.
   Schrieffer, of the University of California at Santa Barbara,
said he believes the presence of heat without observed nuclear
particles is a ``smoking gun'' in the Utah experiments.
   ``I personally do not believe the heat was from anything but a
chemical process,'' he said at a news conference after the session
ended.
   However, he also said he believes experiments that found
evidence of a low level of neutrons or gamma rays indicated energy
was coming from a fusion source, and those hold promise for
scientific study.
   Fusion has long been touted as the possible energy source of the
future. It would be clean because it produces virtually none of the
radioactive waste associated with the fission reaction of nuclear
power plants, and would be plentiful because the basic fuel would
come from water.
   But Norman Hackerman, a National Academy of Sciences member who
co-chaired the conference, told the final session, ``Few of us, if
any, look upon this source as a viable source of power.''
   Steven E. Jones, a Brigham Young University researcher whose
cold fusion experiments have measured low rates of neutrons, also
said he does not believe cold fusion will be a power source.
   ``It's a rose, not a tree,'' Jones said. ``It's not going to
give us energy, but it is beautiful.''
   The cold fusion concept announced by University of Utah chemist
Stanley Pons and British colleague Martin Fleischmann on March 23
stirred the scientific world with its very simplicity.
   The researchers said they produced a fusion reaction in a simple
apparatus. They ran electrical current through electrodes of
palladium and platinum in a jar of heavy water, which is made with
an isotope of hydrogen called deuterium.
   Pons and Fleischmann reported the release of heat which they
attributed to nuclear fusion. They backed down from original claims
they measured gamma rays, but have claimed subsequent experiments
yielded up to 10 times more energy than was consumed.
   The two researchers did not attend this week's conference.
   Papers presented by researchers at Texas A&amp;M University, Brigham
Young, Los Alamos National Laboratory and others reported measuring
neutrons or gamma rays or the presence of tritium, but no excess
heat.
   One group led by Robert A. Huggins of Stanford University
reported heat, but did not test for the presence of nuclear
byproducts.
   Others, such as California Institute of Technology, found no
indications of heat or nuclear processes.

   Clifford B. Stearns, owner of five motels and
three restaurants in central Florida. George Sangmeister, veteran
of the internecine battles of the Illinois legislature. Jim Walsh,
ex-Peace Corpsman, son of a congressman, fighter of civic
corruption in Syracuse, N.Y.
   They came to Washington in January marching to their own agendas
and now find themselves freshmen in a Congress preoccupied with its
own troubles.
   ``Self-flagellation'' is what one of them calls it. Another
deplores the ``stick it to you'' partisanship he finds here while
the people's business waits.
   Stearns wanted to restore a ``citizens Congress.'' He has a
constitutional amendment to limit people to 12 years' service in
Washington, ``then let them have a year to find out again what it
is like to get a parking ticket.''
   Walsh came here to make certain the farmers of upstate New York
had some representation. Nobody from the Empire State had been on
the Agriculture Committee for a long time. He wangled a place on
it. ``We have lots of dairy farmers,'' he says.
   Sangmeister ticks off his issues: education, the need to adjust
America's defense posture in view of fresh winds blowing from
Moscow and Beijing, the environment. ``We used to joke about the
idea of `global warming,' but we don't laugh anymore,'' he says.
   They talked Thursday about their initiation into a Congress that
seems obsessed with itself, its pay, its speaker, its ethics.
   Two months went into maneuvering over whether to take a 51
percent pay raise. Then came the rejected nomination, amid charges
of booze and womanizing, of former Texas Sen. John Tower to be
secretary of defense. There was the shabbiness of the John Mack
affair, the resignation of ``the most powerful aide on the Hill,''
the ``436th congressman'' after a woman he brutally attacked years
ago pointed a finger at him.
   And now what appears to be the inexorable removal of a speaker
of the House for violating an ethics code that didn't exist when he
came to Washington 34 years ago.
   At the Capitol on a glorious morning it seemed obvious why Jim
Wright would be reluctant to give up his role as king of the Hill.
   It has been a wet, lush spring. The azaleas and tulips have
faded but the magnolias _ white blooms as big as a soup bowls _ are
just opening.
   On the steps of the Capitol, Rep. Norman Y. Mineta, D-Calif.,
marks time with his feet while the Emerald Regime Marching Band and
Color Guard from Morgan Hill, Calif., in gold, green and black,
perform a concert for the benefit of anyone happening by.
   For just this moment, the bandsmen lugged their gold, green and
black uniforms and their instruments all the way from California.
Youngsters in baseball caps, their fellow Americans here on class
trips, applaud, take snapshots, chew gum.
   ``What I'm seeing as a new member is a lot more partisanship
that I'd have thought,'' says Democrat Sangmeister, inside.
``Almost as though there's a `Well, it's our turn to stick it to
you' atmosphere.
   ``It started with the Tower matter. Then the Wright affair. Now
the Democrats going after (Newt) Gingrich (new House Republican
whip, accused of ethics violations.)
   ``The election's over; we ought to be getting on with the
people's business,'' Sangmeister said.
   Republican Walsh, hurrying to a meeting, pauses in the Speaker's
Lobby. It is hung with oil portraits of House speakers, the famous
and the forgotten.
   ``Speakers of the House of Representatives of the United
States,'' says a plaque. ``Chosen by the people, honored by the
preferment of their associates.''
   Walsh, whose own father, William, served in Congress from
1973-79, says he wonders about Congress' ``self-flagellation.'' He
says he speaks as one who helped send a mayor of Syracuse to
prison, but worries that the image Congress is giving itself is
destructive in the long run.
   ``We're good people,'' he says of his colleagues, ``but the
people of the country need assurance of that.''
   Stearns, the ``citizen congressman,'' the only Republican to win
an open Democratic seat last fall, admits he ran using Jim Wright
as a symbol of what was wrong in Washington.
   Now he says he thinks higher of the institution than he might
have guessed.
   He got on the Banking Committee, which immediately plunged into
the savings and loan crisis.
   ``We were there working on that bill day after day. It wasn't
partisan. Everyone came together to honestly solve this problem.
The chairman (Rep. Henry Gonzalez) was fair, I've got to admit
that. He let everyone speak. When we were done, it was after
midnight. We gave the chairman a standing ovation.''

<HEAD>Tap Dancing Not Tapped Out Yet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY McGRATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rhythmic art of tap dancing, which
nearly became extinct during the 1950s, isn't tapped out just yet,
a joyful chorus line of dancers proved as they shim-sham-shimmied
across the Golden Gate Bridge.
   ``There is a happiness there when I tap dance,'' said veteran
hoofer Marilyn Winston. ``There are very few ways that comes out of
my body. It's a natural happiness that comes out of me. I have to
tap to live.''
   Although wind and salt air threatened to blow off their hats and
sandblasters drowned out much of the performance, about 30 dancers
hoofed it across the bridge Thursday to celebrate National Tap
Dance Day.
   The national celebration coincided with the birthday of
legendary staircase tapper Bill ``Bojangles'' Robinson, who was
born on May 25, 1878, and died in 1949.
   Robinson and Howard ``Sandman'' Sims popularized the dance in
muscial extravaganzas of the 1930s and 40s, and it later gained
respectability on the stage at Carnegie Hall.
   ``In the 1950s, New York choreographers made the decision not to
put tap in Broadway musicals because it got more and more
superficial, like a joke, with the big funky moves,'' said Rosie,
of Rosie Radiator and the San Francisco Supertappers, who helped
resuscitate the form during the past two decades after it faded in
the '50s.
   The troupe, led by Rosie in her red flared skirt, white tuxedo
vest and sailor hat, is in the Guinness Book of World Records for
longest tap dance _ a 7.3-mile performance.
   Tap, which blends African dance with the Irish jig and lively
English clog, originated among black dancers performing on street
corners and in saloons. Unlike ballet dancers, tap dancers hold
their body limp like a rag doll and use the natural movements to
belt out rhythms with their feet.
   ``It's the way kids move before their mother tells them to stop
scraping their feet,'' said Rosie, describing the art of making
music with your feet. ``The foot is like a musical instrument and
today we are playing the bridge.''
   Against a backdrop of San Francisco skyscrapers and a vast
expanse of water below, the tappers made their way across the
six-land bridge, from Marin to the San Francisco side, where they
received a City Hall proclamation.
   ``Tap dancing is widely recognized as America's only-original
form of dance, yet for years it has been in danger of becoming a
lost art,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., whose resolution was
passed by the House on Thursday declaring May 25 ``National Tap
Dance Day.'' Senate approval is expected, he said in a telephone
interview from Washington D.C.
   Conyers, who admitted being a ``frustrated tap dancer'' soon to
begin lessons, said former Bojangles dance partner Lloyd Story, 65,
tried to tap on the floor of the House but was barred by the
parliamentarian, who said it violated rules against demonstrations.
   On the bridge, Debby Kelehey, an escalator mechanic who
practices on broken escalators in her cowgirl costume, passed the
gold-sequined ``torch of tap'' during the single-file relay watched
by wide-eyed drivers.
   ``I don't care if I'm overweight and pushing 40. I feel like a
star,'' she said, thrusting her arms out like Ethel Merman.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of commercial radio stations across
the United States will go silent for 30 seconds Friday morning as
part of a campaign to show the importance of radio in daily life.
   ``The day the radio stopped'' will mark the beginning of a $100
million campaign with the theme: ``Radio. What would life be
without it.''
   At 7:42 a.m. local time, the booming voice of actor James Earl
Jones will tell listeners that ``for the next 30 seconds this
station and others would like you to imagine your life without
radio. Imagine if all your days sounded like this. ...''
   Following the 30 seconds of dead air, Jones will say: ``Thirty
seconds seems like a long time, doesn't it? Now think how radio
fills that silence for you.''
   About 8,000 stations, about 80 percent of the nation's
commercial stations, will participate, according to the Radio
Advertising Bureau.
   The simultaneous promotion will be the largest in the history of
radio, said bureau spokesman Danny Flamberg. The biggest previous
event was in 1986, when 2,000 radio stations simultaneously
broadcast ``We Are The World'' to promote hunger relief.

<HEAD>House Panel Passes Emergency Relief for Drought-Stricken Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Agriculture Committee has approved
emergency relief legislation to help farmers cope with drought
devastation to their crops.
   The bill passed Thursday was originally intended to apply only
to winter wheat crops, but numerous amendments offered by
congressman in non-wheat states expanded it to include feed grains,
cotton, rice, soybeans, peanuts, sugar beets, sugar cane and
tobacco.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of the Agriculture
subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains and chief architect
of the legislation, said the inclusion of the other crops, which
either have been affected by dry weather or are susceptible to
future drought, was a ``political accommodation.''
   ``We felt if we were going to come with a disaster program, we
had only one bite of the apple,'' he said, recognizing that
producers of crops other than wheat needed help but acknowledging
that a multitude of legislation was not feasible.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter told the committee in a
letter to Glickman that he would not recommend that President Bush
sign the bill unless it was ``budget neutral.'' In that case, it
would have to apply only to 1989 crops affected by drought and be
accompanied by a promise that Congress would agree to use crop
insurance as the sole vehicle for disaster assistance after this
year.
   ``I think we are in the ballpark,'' said Rep. Kika de la Garza,
D-Texas, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, after the vote.
   The concern about crop insurance remains a stumbling block
because farmers consider the current program unsatisfactory.
   ``I hope the secretary won't hold this bill hostage in order to
pass crop insurance,'' said Rep. Bill Sarpalius, D-Texas. He said
the current system, which requires farmers to pay insurance
premiums to protect against the effects of bad weather, doesn't
work.
   De la Garza pointed out that House improvements to the crop
insurance bill would not be completed in time for action on this
bill. But he said the progress Congress is making should indicate
that continued emergency relief such as this legislation will not
be needed in the future.
   John Campbell, deputy agriculture secretary in charge of
commodities, appeared before the committee to explain Yeutter's
concerns. After the vote, he said the secretary's first question
would be, ``How much will it cost?''
   De la Garza estimated that the bill would cost about $1 billion,
an amount close to what the government will save in price support
payments to farmers. An amendment to the bill offered by Rep. Fred
Grandy, R-Iowa, prohibits disaster relief from exceeding the amount
saved in price supports.
   Since the drought caused a shortage in commodities supply _
primarily wheat _ prices should rise, alleviating the need for
government subsidies. The money that had been set aside for the
price supports would therefore be used to pay the farmers who lost
their crops to drought.
   The administration wants farmers to purchase crop insurance
rather than depend on the government to bail them out when bad
weather causes crop failures.
   The bill would require farmers to have insurance after this year
to cope with bad weather or other natural disasters.

graduation ceremonies, a fire official said.
   At least six people suffered major injuries and six were injured
slightly in the accident around 9 p.m. at Fowler High School, said
Assistant Fire Chief Roger Lundy.
   The accident happened as graduation ceremonies for about 30
seniors were ending, Lundy said. ``They were starting the
processional and the spectators stood up and it collapsed,'' he
said.
   Rescuers had to lift bleachers off some victims. Lundy said
rescuers had to lift the bleachers off some of the victims. He said

   The injured were taken to hospitals in Pueblo about 30 miles to

   John Montagna says a 15-pound salmon was small
fry compared to the 9-year-old girl he saved from drowning.
   Montagna, 43, had landed the fish Sunday at the Deschutes River
when he saw little Amber Blankenship slip from a rock ledge into a
treacherous sinkhole.
   ``I jumped in where I thought she'd be and went down too,''
Montagna said. When he surfaced from the 30-foot-deep river, the
girl was nowhere to be seen.
   ``It was the sickest moment of my life. She could have been
inches from my fingers.''
   Moments later the girl popped out of the water about 12 feet
away. Montagna, an ironworker, grabbed the girl and pulled her out
of the water with the help of others on shore.
   Amber wasn't breathing, but her heart was still beating, and she
was revived, said her mother, Lola Blankenship.
   ``There are no thanks big enough for this gentleman,''
Blankenship said. ``Very few people come out alive because of the
rocks. The river is so mean; it just boils.''
   ``I was in the right place at the right time,'' Montagna said.
   The Deschutes runs through Bend in central Oregon, about 160
miles southeast of Portland.

<HEAD>Investigators Probe Relationship Between Two Shipmates in USS Iowa

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navy and FBI investigators, stymied so far in
their search for accidental causes of last month's explosion aboard
the battleship Iowa, are conducting a ``very thorough'' criminal
investigation involving two shipmates who had a falling out,
officials say.
   The officials, most of whom asked not to be identified, said no
conclusive evidence has been developed suggesting criminal intent _
either homicide or suicide _ was behind the April 19 blast that
killed 47 sailors.
   ``But there are some unusual aspects to the relationship between
these sailors that is being investigated,'' said one source.
   ``We have no evidence to prove homicide or suicide here,'' added
Deborah Johnson, a Naval Investigative Service agent in Norfolk,
Va., where the Iowa is based. She described theories of homicide or
suicide as ``possibilities among many possibilities.''
   ``Let me put it this way,'' said Peter Williams, the Pentagon's
chief spokesman. ``The Navy is investigating all leads that it
gets. It wants to be very thorough with this investigation.''
   Williams agreed publicly Thursday that the Navy's inquiry had
``a criminal investigation aspect to it'' and that the FBI was
doing more than just helping the Navy sift through forensic
evidence. But he declined further discussion of the criminal
inquiries.
   At the same time, Williams announced that investigators had
ruled out another leading accident explanation for the explosion in
the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret: that the powder for the 16-inch gun
had been rendered unstable by improper storage last summer.
   The Navy is still investigating why the Iowa's powder was stored
aboard hot, non-air-conditioned barges last summer during an
overhaul. But Williams said subjecting the powder to high
temperatures affects its shelf life, not its stability.
   As for the criminal inquiry, the sources said investigators are
looking into the relationship between 25-year-old Gunner's Mate
Clayton M. Hartwig, who died in the blast, and Gunner's Mate 3rd
Class Kendall Truitt, 21, who survived.
   The two had been best friends and named each other as life
insurance beneficiaries, but had a falling out last year when
Truitt got married. Truitt stands to collect $100,000 from the life
insurance policy on Hartwig.
   Truitt worked at the bottom of the seven-level gun turret aboard
the Iowa while Hartwig worked at the very top, next to the huge
guns. The only men to survive the explosion were those at the very
bottom.
   NBC News has quoted unidentified sources as saying the Navy is
investigating the possibility that a detonating device was hidden
in a burlap patch that gunners insert between bags of powder. The
patches are designed to clean the barrels of the battleship's guns
during firing.
   Johnson of the NIS said Thursday that in a search of Truitt's
home after the explosion, investigators found one of the burlap
patches. ``Yes, it was there, but it wasn't tampered with,'' she
said. ``It's a fact that people pick up items for memorabilia.''
   A search of Hartwig's car last Monday, meanwhile, turned up a
crude detonating device and the book ``How to Get Even Without
Going to Jail,'' New York Newsday reported Thursday. The book
explains how to build booby traps and other deadly devices,
according to sources the newspaper did not name.
   Truitt was quoted in reports last week as saying the Navy
created homicide or suicide explanations involving him and Hartwig
to make them scapegoats for an explosion investigators cannot
otherwise explain.
   Alan Holt, the father of a Fort Myers, Fla., man killed in the
explosion, said he also was skeptical of reports suggesting
sabotage was behind the blast.
   Holt said he wondered ``if they're going to let those two guys
take the blame to get it off the Navy's neck.''
   His wife, Karla Holt, added, ``You have to wonder about whether
(the suspected sailors) are scapegoats.'' The Holts' only son,
Scott Alan, was among the 47 people killed.
   Truitt, from Tampa, Fla., has said that in response to
investigators' questions, he denied a homosexual relationship with
Hartwig. He is on leave from the ship and is being transferred to
another post, Williams said Thursday.
   Truitt arrived at Miami International Airport on Thursday night
in the company of his wife and Miami attorney Ellis Rubin. Truitt
refused to talk, but reporters asked Rubin if his client had been
charged.
   ``No, but there's been a lot of media accusations, and you've
got to respond to them,'' Rubin said. ``So we're going to do that.''

<HEAD>Navy Investigating `Severe' Cracks in Hull of New Atomic Submarine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of two serious cracks is
necessitating the replacement of part of the steel hull of a
nuclear submarine under construction at a Groton, Conn., shipyard,
the Electric Boat Co. said.
   Navy officials said Thursday they have opened an investigation
into the cracks on the Topeka, a SSN-688 fast-attack sub.
   The problem in the Electric Boat shipyard is ``quite severe''
and ``a very unusual occurrence,'' the company said in a memo to
lawmakers.
   ``A thorough investigation is being conducted which will include
recommendations for repair,'' the memo said. ``Topeka will not put
to sea until Electric Boat and the Navy are fully satisfied that
the vessel is safe.''
   Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics Corp., said
workers discovered the cracks on the outer steel hull Monday
afternoon during sandblasting operations in Groton and reported
them to the Navy.
   The hull is made at Electric Boat's plant in North Kingstown,
R.I., and assembled at the company's main plant in Groton.
   Company spokesman Neil Ruenzel, reached late Thursday, said the
memo may have ``overstated things as far as severity.''
   Ruenzel said a ``very small section'' of the hull has been
removed and will be replaced.
   ``It's quite severe from the standpoint that we would not let
that matter go unattended and we felt and do feel that it was
necessary to remove that section, not only for analysis but we
would not deliver that submarine with cracks,'' he said. ``So the
severity meant that the section needed to be replaced.''
   ``It's a big job, but we're equipped to handle that,'' Ruenzel
said.
   He provided no cost estimate and said he did not know if the
replacement will delay the project. Ruenzel said he was unaware of
any similar cracking of a submarine hull.
   Perry Pockros, an aide to Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., who
represents the Groton district, said it was clear the cracks would
force Electric Boat to push back its Sept. 30 commission date.
   Lt. Jim Wood, a Navy spokesman on submarine issues, said the
Navy had no immediate comment.
   The Topeka, designated SSN-754, is a 360-foot, 6,900-ton, Los
Angeles-class submarine. The vessels, designed to hunt down enemy
subs and surface warships, are armed with Mark 48 anti-submarine
torpedoes, Harpoon missiles and Tomahawk cruise missiles.
   Construction of the Topeka, ordered by the Navy in 1983, was
begun on Jan. 23, 1988. It is scheduled to be commissioned on Sept.
30.
   The Los Angeles-class submarines are built by Electric Boat and
the Newport News (Va.) Shipbuilding Co. The last SSN-688 is
expected in the 1990 fiscal budget. The subs will be replaced by
the SSN-21 Seawolf.
   Ruenzel said Armco Inc. of Parsippany, N.J., supplied the steel
on the part of the hull that cracked.
   ``It is too premature to identify any financial liabilities,''
the memo said. ``Results of a complete investigation will be
required.''

<HEAD>Haughey Calls For Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey has called
a general election for June 15 in a bid to capitalize on Ireland's
economic revival and win his first outright parliamentary majority
in five attempts.
   His minority government, elected 28 months ago by the slimmest
margin possible, announced the election Thursday.
   Haughey, 63, is midway through a maximum five-year term. His
fiscal austerity has brought a turnaround from harsh recession,
reflected in a low inflation rate of 3.3 percent, a trade surplus
and a moderate economic growth rate.
   His Fianna Fail Party will form the first single-party majority
government since 1977-81 if its 50 percent-plus approval rating in
recent opinion polls is reflected in the election.
   Critics say opposition parties, led by the main opposition Fine
Gael under its new leader Alan Dukes, are in disarray and unable to
offer a credible alternative.
   But with interest rates creeping up this month to 9.25 percent
and signs inflation may rise, Haughey wants to try for an outright
parliamentary majority before the economic situation deteriorates.
   Critics complain that the improvements in this island republic
of 3.4 million people are not filtering through to the poor and the
young. Unemployment remains at 17.9 percent and emigration, at an
estimated 32,000 a year, is at its highest level since the 1950s.
   Government officialssay Haughey wants to discard minority
government status before Ireland assumes the six-month rotating
presidency of the European Economic Community on Jan. 1.
   His staying power, charisma and political mastery have long
confounded his opponents.
   Haughey has won and lost office twice. In February 1987, Haughey
led party to less than a majority in the Dail, or parliament,
sneaking in on the vote of one left-wing maverick.
   In 1970, Haughey, then finance minister, was acquitted on
charges of conspiring to smuggle guns to Roman Catholic rebels
fighting British rule in Northern Ireland.
   He was fired from government, but returned to a series of high
party posts before leading the party to power in 1979.
   Scandal blighted Haughey's 1982 administration. An aide accused
of stuffing ballot boxes was acquitted on a technicality, two
unsympathetic journalists found their telephones were tapped and a
murder suspect was found in the attorney general's home.
   Party dissidents mounted a campaign to oust him, but Haughey
outmaneuvered them. They are now gone, and Fianna Fail under
Haughey is once again unified.

   The American Civil Liberties Union says it
will defend a pair of Ohio veterans if the government prosecutes
them for arranging trips to Vietnam to heal ``old, deep wounds''
from the war they fought there two decades ago.
   The announcement Thursday came just one day after the Treasury
Department reaffirmed its intention to pursue a vigorous
enforcement program against violations of embargoes that it says
prohibit Americans from promoting or arranging unauthorized travel
to Vietnam.
   Susan R. Brenda, legislative analyst with the Washington office
of the ACLU, said ``The Treasury Department is simply without
authority to reach directly into the First Amendment-protected
activities of Americans in the United States and prevent them from
organizing towards the perfectly legal end of travel to Vietnam.''
   Ms. Brenda appeared at a news conference with Donald Mills and
John Myers, members of the Vietnam Veterans of America chapter in
Akron, Ohio. The two men have organized six bargain-rate tours of
Vietnam for veterans since 1984, and they said they will go ahead
with another in November.
   ``We believe that an attempt to prosecute Vietnam veterans for
traveling back to Vietnam in an effort to learn about present-day
Vietnam and heal old, deep wounds would be a grave mistake,'' Ms.
Brenda said. ``Should the government proceed along that course,
however, we will assist these veterans in their legal defense.''
   It is legal for Americans to travel to Vietnam, but the Treasury
Department issued regulations last year making it illegal to
``arrange, promote, or facilitate group or individual tours or
travel'' to any country listed under the Trading with the Enemy Act.
   This list now includes Vietnam, Cambodia, North Korea and Cuba.
   Mills and Myers began organizing tours of Vietnam after Mills
revisited the country in 1984 as a member of the national board of
Vietnam Veterans of America, which was looking into controversies
over the defoliant Agent Orange and the issue of American
servicemen missing in action.
   Mills said that when he spoke to chapters of the organization
upon his return, he found them mainly interested in hearing what
Vietnam is like now.
   Two veterans who have gone on the tours spoke glowingly of their
experiences at the news conference.
   ``I found out that despite all of our efforts we weren't able to
kill the whole country,'' said Greg Kleven, 40, of Concord, Calif.,
a former Marine. ``It's still alive. Alive and well.''
   Mark McCausland, 38, of Munroe Falls, Ohio, an Army veteran who
lost an arm and a leg in a rocket attack in Vietnam, said ``The
image that I have of Vietnam now is of a peaceful green little
country, where the image I had before was of a place that was
deadly.''
   ``It would be a real shame to allow anybody to prevent other
veterans from going through the same process,'' McCausland said.
   McCausland said he believed it would be nearly impossible for
most veterans to return to Vietnam on their own because of the
expense and paperwork involved.
   Myers said the organized tours last about three weeks ``from
home town to home town'' and cost $2,700, including transportation,
meals and accommodations.
   Steven I. Pinter, chief of licensing for the Treasury
Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, wrote Mills and
Myers on Feb. 10 directing them to ``immediately terminate
performing any activities involving travel tours to Vietnam.''
   The letter said violation of the regulations carries a maximum
penalty of a $50,000 fine and 10 years imprisonment.
   On May 15, Lindblad Travel Inc. of Westport, Conn., pleaded
guilty in U.S. District Court in Connecticut to unlawfully
arranging a group tour of Vietnam and Cambodia. Sentencing was set
for June 14. One of the customers booking the tour was an
undercover agent of the Customs Service.
   In a news release about the Lindblad case on Wednesday,
Salvatore R. Martoche, assistant secretary of the Treasury for
enforcement, said, ``This case should send a strong message that
violations of the Vietnam and Cambodia sanctions program will not
be tolerated.''
   Martoche said the Customs Service and Office of Foreign Assets
Control ``will continue to work closely with the Department of
Justice to pursue a vigorous enforcement program against violations
of these and other embargoes.''

   Kazuko Takatsukasa, the elder sister of Emperor
Akihito, died of heart failure at a Tokyo hospital early today,
Imperial Palace officials said. She was 59.
   Mrs. Takatsukasa was the third daughter of the late Emperor
Hirohito, Japan's longest reigning monarch, who died Jan. 7.
   She served as Lord Custodian of the Great Shrine of Ise, a major
Shinto shrine in western Japan, for 14 years. She resigned in
October, citing poor health.
   She had been suffering from internal ailments for the past two
years, reportedly breast and rectal cancer. Imperial Palace and
hospital officials declined to comment on the reports.
   She had been intermittently hospitalized since her first surgery
in 1987, said an official of the Imperial Household Agency on
condition of anonymity.
   In December, Mrs. Takatsukasa underwent a second breast surgery
and chemotherapy.
   In 1950, Mrs. Takatsukasa married Toshimitsu Takatsukasa, member
of one of the five families who have traditionally served as chief
advisers to the imperial family. Her husband died in 1966.
   She is survived by an adopted son, Naotake, 44.
   There was no announcement of funeral arrangements.

<HEAD>Officials Consider Congressman's Threat to Hold Up Contra Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration officials are trying to
decide how to handle a congressman's threat to hold up aid for
Latin America unless officials concede they misled lawmakers about
U.S. efforts to win third-country help for Nicaraguan rebels.
   State Department and White House officials met Thursday to
discuss a letter Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, sent to
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, said a congressional source
who asked not to be named.
   An administration official confirmed discussions were being held
on the letter.
   Obey complained that his committee, which acts on the
administration's requests for foreign aid, ``was clearly misled by
administration spokesmen in the past concerning the linkage of U.S.
aid to the Contras.''
   He asked Baker to provide him with a letter ``for the record to
show that the administration understands that, so we can move on to
other business.''
   ``I would hope that this matter could be cleared up by a simple
letter so that further hearings would not be required before we''
vote on aid to Latin America, he said.
   Obey pointed out that time is short, since the vote is expected
to take place within the next two weeks.
   Further hearings could delay the vote on the administration's
request for some $700 million in Central American aid for fiscal
1990, said an Obey aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The United States has backed the Contra rebels since 1981 in
their fight to oust the leftist government in Nicaragua.
   Documents that surfaced at former White House aide Oliver
North's recent trial and other information ``would seem to justify
a committee conclusion that aid to Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador
and Costa Rica was used as leverage to get those countries to help
the Contras'' and circumvent a 1984 congressional ban on such
assistance, Obey wrote.
   He also noted that Michael Kozak, acting assistant secretary of
state for Latin America, testified before Obey's panel last month
that a plan to expedite aid to Honduras in return for its promise
to help the rebels was never carried out.
   ``But clearly it was,'' Obey said.
   Obey said he wrote to Kozak asking him to clear up discrepancies
between his testimony and other documents, but did not receive an
answer.
   ``If the administration has other documents which can back up''
Kozak's contentions, they should be supplied to the committee
immediately, Obey said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Seeks Review of Challenge to Workload at Overseas School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court is calling for a
review of a labor union's challenge to increase teaching workloads
at overseas schools.
   At issue are additional duties for teachers at 250 schools for
children of U.S. military personnel, operated by a unit of the
Defense Department.
   The appeals court on Thursday reversed a decision of the Federal
Labor Relations Authority that had supported the Defense
Department's refusal to bargain with the teachers about the extra
work.
   ``The Authority never measured the impact of management's
changes upon the ... employees,'' said the ruling by U.S. Court of
Appeals Judge Spottswood Robinson.
   In 1984, administrators with the Department of Defense Dependent
Schools announced changes that would reduce hiring of substitute
teachers, thereby requiring full-time teachers were to fill in.
Hiring of outside help to monitor lunchrooms and playgrounds also
would be discontinued, with full-time teachers and professionals
handling these chores. Additional work was subsequently instituted
for compensatory education programs as well.
   The Overseas Education Association submitted proposals designed
to minimize the effect of the changes. DODDS bargained on some of
them, but refused to do so on others.
   The Labor Relations Authority upheld the Defense Department
unit, saying the union's proposals interfered directly with
management's reserved right to assign work.
   The union, however, said its proposals qualified for bargaining
because they involved adversely-affected employees.
   The extra duties, said the union, forced the teachers do some
work on their own time at home.
   ``The Authority missed the point completely,'' said the judge.
Robinson and two judges who concurred in a separate opinion
reversed the Authority's decisions and sent the cases back for
further consideration.

<HEAD>Air Traffic Controllers Survey, Skinner Disagree</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air traffic controllers say their hours are
too long and they have to watch too many planes in the sky, but
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says the system they run is
the safest in the world.
   A survey released by a congressional subcommittee Thursday shows
widespread discontent among the men and women who sit at screens
and help guide the airplanes from airport to airport.
   ``Morale is horrible, traffic intolerable, management
insensitive; we're overworked, understaffed and abused,'' said one
unidentified controller who responded to the survey by the General
Accounting Office.
   An air traffic control supervisor was quoted as saying there are
busy hours at major hubs ``when the system teeters on the brink of
being unsafe.''
   Sixty-five percent of controllers responding to the survey felt
they handled too much traffic, 59 percent thought they were
required to work too long without a break, and 43 percent said
their morale was low.
   The survey by GAO, which is Congress' investigative arm, was
based on 5,098 questionnaires filled out late last year by
controllers and supervisors at the Federal Aviation
Administration's 84 largest facilities. Those responding made up
about one-third of the workforce.
   The survey included analysis by an independent consulting group,
the Flight Safety Foundation, that said the system is safe but the
margin of safety is narrow.
   The report detailing results of the survey was titled ``Serious
Problems Continue to Trouble the Air Traffic Control Work Force.''
   The results indicate that little has changed in the system since
1985 when a similar survey was conducted with nearly identical
responses.
   The latest figures on air traffic controllers show their number
has for the first time exceeded the 16,244 that worked before a
1981 strike that brought the firing of 70 percent of the workforce.
   But House members said and the FAA confirmed that there are
still 3,600 fewer ``full performance controllers'' than eight years
ago, and their number recently has dwindled further. The
controllers qualified to handle radar and other critical tasks
numbered 9,689 at the end of last month, compared to 9,858 last
Sept. 30 when the controller survey was completed.
   Sitting at a computer terminal in his office that shows the
minute-by-minute location of every commercial flight over the
continental United States, Skinner praised the system.
   Before demonstrating the terminal, which is hooked up to the air
traffic control system, Skinner said he has talked to more
controllers around the country than any previous secretary and
believes morale is high.
   He acknowledged some discontent over inadequate pay scales at
larger, more complex operations, and said morale is affected
somewhat by outdated equipment.
   ``The system is bulging at the seams, but it's still the safest
system in the world,'' Skinner said.
   Acting FAA head Robert E. Whittington told the subcommittee the
agency's own surveys show high employee job satisfaction.
   ``Overall, the morale of our controller work force is good,
although it varies from facility to facility and does not remain
static over time,'' Whittington said.
   The survey said traffic volume has grown by 30 percent to 40
percent at major airports since the controllers' strike.
   ``Our equipment level is, in a word, prehistoric,'' said one
controller quoted by GAO official Kenneth M. Mead, who summarized
the survey for the subcommittee.
   Mead said controllers and supervisors were given assurances of
confidentiality when they filled out the survey forms.

<DATELINE>TINY TOWN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A miniature city built 75 years ago as a
play town for a businessman's daughter opens Saturday after a
sprucing up, and its operators hope it will once again be a top
tourist attraction.
   Tiny Town is located about five miles southwest of Denver and
boasts more than 70 buildings. Many are miniature replicas of
Denver historical buildings such as the city's first fire station,
the first telephone office, Mrs. Murphy's Boarding House, some
landmark mansions and some businesses.
   Twenty of the buildings _ most of which are little taller than
an adult's waist _ are the originals that George Turner built for
his daughter as a fantasy village beginning in 1915.
   On a hillside across Turkey Creek from the main village are
several replicas of old mining structures similar to those still in
place around such historical mining towns as Central City and
Cripple Creek.
   On Saturday, a Colorado Ballet performance in the tiny village
once known as Turnerville will mark Tiny Town's emergence from the
tall mountain weeds that shrouded it for several years.
   Tiny Town was closed for the better part of five years for
renovation by volunteers working for the non-profit Tiny Town
Foundation.
   The town was opened to the public on selected weekends last
summer, and when 11,000 people visited during the first one, the
group decided it better prepare for bigger crowds than anticipated.
   Research indicates it is the oldest miniature town in the United
States, says Bob Kintzele, a longtime Tiny Town fan who helped with
the restoration.
   The village is still for children, said Kintzele.
   ``They come up here and you don't have to tell them this is for
kids,'' he said.
   George Turner's creation, which grew from a few small buildings
in 1915 to about 125 by 1925, was one of the state's top three
tourist attractions behind Buffalo Bill Cody's grave and Pike's
Peak.
   At one time, a tiny working railroad wound its way around the
town and back and forth across Turkey Creek on miniature trestles.
The steam-powered locomotive had a miniature roundhouse where it
turned around and spent the winter.
   Tiny Town survived damaging floods in 1929 and 1932 and a fire
that swept up Turkey Creek Canyon in 1935, destroying the principal
buildings, although leaving the miniature buildings intact. In 1969
a flood left behind a debris-strewn ghost town.
   The biggest disaster was in 1948 when U.S. 285, which ran next
to Tiny Town, was rerouted, taking the village ``out of sight, out
of mind,'' Kintzele said.
   Turner, who ran a moving company, sold the town in 1927.
   One of the town's restorations was by Lyle Fulkerson, who bought
the town in 1972. Fulkerson, a model train buff and master
mechanic, widened and deepened Turkey Creek to prevent furture
floods and regraded the railroad bed.
   But five years later, Fulkerson was killed when his car was hit
by a runaway train while he was traveling from Denver to Tiny Town.
The next year Tiny Town lost its lease and fell into disrepair. It
was closed to the public in 1983.
   Age also took its toll on the Tiny Town Railroad. The caboose
and a few cars are still usable, but the track and track bed need
replacing and the locomotive must be rebuilt, with parts impossible
to find, said Kintzele. He said it would cost $100,000 to put the
railroad back in operation.
   That part of the operation is still in the future, he said. The
train, made on a bigger scale than the rest of the town to
accommodate children, ``who aren't one-sixth scale,'' won't run
during the 1989 season, but will be there for visitors to see, he
said.

   A man who killed a widow and stole her
Christmas presents was executed in Alabama's electric chair early
Friday after the U.S. Supreme Court denied his appeal.
   Michael Lindsey, 28, was the fourth person executed in Alabama
and the 111th in the nation since the 1976 Supreme Court ruling
allowing states to resume capital punishment.
   Lindsey stared at Warden Charlie Jones as the death warrant was
read. Asked whether he wanted to say anything, Lindsey shook his
head.
   He was declared dead at 12:10 a.m., prison officials said.
   The high court rejected Lindsey's appeal Thursday despite
dissents by Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, said
court spokeswoman Toni House. Both justices oppose capital
punishment.
   Lindsey had no reaction to the court's decision, said prison
spokesman John Hale. Lindsey spent his final hours in Holman Prison
with chaplain Robert Simmons, who had said Lindsey was taking it
``very well, very quiet,'' Hale said.
   Earlier, Gov. Guy Hunt, a Primitive Baptist preacher, refused to
grant clemency to Lindsey.
   ``The governor declines to alter the decision of the jury and
the courts,'' said Stacey Rimer, Hunt's assistant press secretary.
   Lindsey was convicted in the 1981 stabbing and shooting death of
64-year-old Rosemary Zimlich Rutland in Mobile.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday found no
merit in Lindsey's request for a stay, according to court spokesman
Matt Davidson.
   The governor's legal adviser, Bill Wasden, said before Hunt's
decision that clemency could only be granted if there were
``evidence that was not presented at the trial that was so
overwhelming as to preclude every other possibility but innocence.''
   Wasden and the governor's chief of staff, Holman Head, met
Wednesday with Lindsey's sister and spoke by telephone with his
mother, who lives in California. The governor, who is traveling
around the state, did not attend the meeting
   Mrs. Rutland was killed Dec. 14, 1981. She was bound, gagged,
stabbed and shot, and Christmas presents were taken from her home.
Police investigators said Lindsey was captured at a shopping mall
using the victim's credit cards.
   Lindsey lived in a rental house directly behind Mrs. Rutland's
home.
   Mobile County District Attorney Chris Galanos said Lindsey
killed the woman because she recognized him.
   Alabama's last electrocution was Aug. 28, 1987, when Wayne
Eugene Ritter was put to death for his non-triggerman role in the
robbery and killing of a Mobile pawn shop owner.

   Americans are learning more about AIDS but it may
be years before this increased knowledge slows the spread of the
disease, according to a federal study.
   The one-year survey of public awareness by the federal Centers
for Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics showed
an increase of people who know AIDS is spread through sexual
intercourse and not from casual contact with infected persons.
   But people can be infected with the AIDS virus for 10 years
before symptoms appear, complicating detection of the disease, said
Marcie Cynamon of the NCHS Division of Health Interview Statistics
near Bethesda, Md..
   The study released Thursday was based on about 3,500 interviews
a month from August 1987 to August 1988 and administered by the
U.S. Census Bureau.
   The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report said that the
percentage of parents who discussed AIDS with their children
remained constant at about 60 percent but that those reporting
their children had AIDS education in schools was up from 36 percent
to 59 percent.
   Over the period of the survey, the percentage of adults
correctly answering that it was ``definitely true'' that AIDS was
an infectious viral disease increased from 44 percent to 64 percent.
   Other findings of the study included:
   _Those who knew it is very unlikely or impossible to contract
AIDS by working near someone who has the disease increased from 53
percent to 67 percent.
   _The percentage of people putting considerable trust in the use
of condoms or restricting relations to one uninfected partner
remained basically unchanged in the 92 percent range.
   _The percentage of people saying they knew ``a lot'' or ``some''
about AIDS increased from 60 to 66 percent.
   _Those feeling they have no chance of getting the AIDS virus
increased from 60 percent to 75 percent.
   _Those answering correctly that AIDS can be transmitted through
intercourse with an infected person increased from 75 percent to
about 85 percent.

   A high school student's effort to honor two
classmates killed in a car accident ended in his own death when a
500-pound soccer goal post toppled onto him as he placed a memorial
wreath on top of it.
   Jason Goldfarb, 17, a junior from Stow, died at Clinton Hospital
where he was taken after the accident Thursday morning.
   Nashoba Regional High School Principal Sam Pawluk said Goldfarb
and several other students were distraught over the deaths of
classmates Steven Rausch and Joanne Basteri. Rausch and Basteri
were killed Wednesday night when the car they were riding in struck
a tree.
   ``Today some kids were having trouble coping with that. In their
grief and sorrow, they'd walk out to the soccer field and just sit
and cry out there,'' Pawluk said. ``(Goldfarb) was climbing on the
goal to leave something there as a remembrance. It toppled, fell
over and killed him.''
   Police said Goldfarb was climbing the soccer goal on the campus
field to sit with friends mourning Rausch and Basteri, who Pawluk
said were soccer players in this town about 30 miles west of Boston.
   The principal said that a few students were already sitting on
the 8-foot-high steel goal. One student was treated for minor
injuries and released from the hospital. The others escaped injury.
   Pawluk said the school canceled today's classes but the building
would be open, and teachers and counselors would be available if
students want to talk about the tragedies.
   ``It's been a devastating experience for everyone here, but
we'll get over it,'' Pawluk said. ``We'll grow from it.''

   The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen
Friday, while stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange advanced to
a new high.
   The dollar, which started at 140.85 yen, closed at 140.40 yen,
down 1.95 yen from the previous day's close of 142.35 yen. The
currency changed hands between 139.90 yen and 141.10 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 153.57 points
Thursday, added another 186.23 points, or 0.55 percent, to close at
34,191.62 points, a new high.
   ``The dollar was sold slightly during early morning, but as a
whole it was a seesaw game,'' said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo
who spoke anonymously.
   Another dealer said the market appears to be headed for another
choppy day of short-term, directionless trade.
   Commenting on a government report showing an increase of 3.3
percent in the Tokyo-area consumer price index, Finance Minister
Tatsuo Murayama told a news conference Friday morning that the
report ``is not something to be alarmed about.''
   Maruyama said currency rates had little impact on the latest
Tokyo consumer price index figures, released by the Management and
Coordination Agency. The May index showed an increase of 0.6
percent from the previous month.
   On the stock marekt, dealers said the Nikkei index rose, with
shares being bought broadly due to the relative stability of
exchange rates.

   Armitage, currently the assistant defense secretary for

5.''
   Williams quoted Armitage as writing in his letter of resignation
that he could ``no longer accommodate the needs of my ever-growing
family with the time and travel demands of public service.''
   Bush told Armitage he was withdrawing the nomination with
regrets, saying in a letter: ``Your years of work to build strong

<HEAD>Hams Recalled That May Be Undercooked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Cedar Rapids, Iowa, food processor,
Cedarrapids Meats Inc., has voluntarily recalled an estimated 800
canned hams distributed in 13 states because the meat may be
undercooked, the Agriculture Department said.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said the hams _ a total of about
9,000 pounds _ could cause trichinosis if eaten. However, he added,
no illnesses have been reported.
   The hams were distributed to consignees in Arkansas, Florida,
Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. Those may have sold
the hams to customers in other states.
   The product was described as canned 11-pound, 4-ounce hams
labeled ``Wilson Continental Deli Ham, Water Added.'' The
establishment number, ``Est. 111'' is printed inside the USDA
inspection seal on the label. Crawford said the hams can be
identified by the code number 0898D embossed on the end of the can.

<HEAD>Enforcement of Spill Liability Laws Said Flawed</HEAD>

   Laws aimed at making polluters pay for oil
spills and toxic wastes are not working because the government
hasn't been willing to spend enough to assess the damages,
environmental lawyers say.
   State environmental prosecutors from New York and Massachusetts
told a House subcommittee Thursday that Interior Department
regulations, coupled with the lack of funds for assessment studies,
actually obstruct more than enhance efforts to make polluters pay.
   ``The rules so severely limited the damages collectable that, to
our knowledge, no state trustees have used the regulations in the
almost three years since their promulgation,'' said New York
Assistant Attorney General Gordon Johnson.

   Two environmental groups joined the state of
California and the AFL-CIO in suing the Environmental Protection
Agency for allegedly failing to protect consumers from dangerous
pesticides in food.
   The suit asks that the federal courts require the EPA to impose
more stringent regulations on cancer-causing chemicals in food,
especially in processed fruits and vegetables often consumed by
small children.
   Al Meyerhoff, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the suit is aimed at forcing the EPA to be more
aggresive in prohibiting the use of pesticides on food and to ban
them altogether if they are found to cause cancer.
   Under current EPA procedures, the agency allows the use of some
older pesticides even though agency officials concede that if the
same chemicals were newly introduced they would not be approved
because of health concerns.
   In addition to the Natural Resources Defense Council, plaintiffs
in the lawsuit are Public Citizen, a private environmental and
consumer group in Washington, the state attorney general of
California and the AFL-CIO. The NRDC is a private, non-profit
environmental organization.

<HEAD>Congress Asked To Overhaul Medicare Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Physicians and lawmakers are urging Congress
to overhaul the system of Medicare payments that enables a doctor
in New York to receive $7,500 for triple-bypass surgery while a
Kansas colleague only gets $3,500.
   ``The current system is completely out of whack,'' Rep. Wayne
Owens, D-Utah, told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
health and the environment Thursday.
   Witnesses who testified before the House panel agreed the
Medicare physician reimbursement system discriminates against
doctors practicing in rural areas, but they disagreed over ways to
eliminate the inequities.
   Under discussion were the recommendations of the Physician
Payment Review Commission, an independent agency that monitors
Medicare payments and has proposed replacing the present system
with a Medicare fee schedule.

<HEAD>Many Doctors Say They Would Deceive Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many doctors say they would lie to a patient's
family if their errors had led to the patient's death, a study on
deception in the medical profession shows.
   The survey published today in the Journal of the American
Medical Association said many doctors would engage in various forms
of deception to help themselves or to protect patients.
   The lead researcher said the results should not signal distrust
in physicians.
   ``People who read the study superficially might think, `My god,
you can't trust your doctor anymore; they're deceptive,''' said Dr.
Dennis H. Novack.
   ``I would challenge that,'' said Novack, an associate professor
of community health at Brown University Program of Medicine in
Providence, R.I.
   More than two-thirds of doctors surveyed indicated a willingness
to help patients get insurance benefits by misrepresenting a test,
according to the study.
   Doctors ``appear to justify their decisions in terms of the
consequences and to place a higher value on their patients' welfare
and keeping patients' confidences than on truth-telling for its own
sake,'' the researchers said.
   But ``under extreme circumstances, some physicians would
consider deceiving to benefit themselves.''
   More than one-third of the doctors surveyed for the article
indicated they would offer incomplete or misleading information to
the family of a very sick patient after making a mistake that led
to the patient's death.
   Such behavior is not necessarily unethical, said Daniel
Callahan, director of the Hastings Center of Briarcliff Manor,
N.Y., a research institute that studies ethical problems in
medicine. Callahan, a non-physician, was not involved in the study.
   ``I think it is inevitable physicians are fallible, and we need
to understand their fallibility,'' he said. ``I think they don't
have to reveal their errors to patients.''
   Novack said 80 percent of respondents indicated they ``rarely or
never'' use deception in their own practices. The hypothetical
cases posed ``some of the hardest cases they could have,'' he said
in a telephone interview Thursday.
   The researchers presented four hypothetical problems to 211
physicians in an unspecified Northeast state. The doctors answered
multiple-choice questions about what courses of action they would
choose and why.
   More than half of the doctors said they would permit a patient
who had contracted gonorrhea from a prostitute to mislead his wife
_ not the doctor's patient _ about the nature of the disease.
   The deception involved letting the patient tell his wife the
disease was a non-specific urethritis not acquired through sex.
That way, the patient could have his wife get treatment without
jeopardizing his marriage.
   Less than 10 percent of the physicians said they would deceive a
mother to avoid revealing an adolescent daughter's pregnancy, while
more than 30 percent said they would leave the decision entirely up
to the girl.
   Callahan said tradition favors allowing the patient to decide.
   ``If there's any firm rule in medicine _ probably the most firm
rule _ it is that doctors need to maintain patient
confidentiality,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``Refusing to
break a medical confidence has never been called deception.''

   A 13-year-old boy arrested in the morning with a
loaded automatic handgun went back to police in the evening asking
for his gun back.
   ``He made the trip to come down here to inquire about his gun so
I would at least think that he was serious,'' said Lt. Joseph
Lacorazza.
   In 15 years as a transit police officer, Lacorazza said, he's
never seen anything like it. ``Basically he was informed that the
gun is evidence in the investigation and he couldn't have it.''
   The boy, whose name was not released because of his age, was
stopped at a subway station in the borough of Brooklyn when a
transit policeman saw him enter without paying a fare, said Al
O'Leary, a transit police spokesman.
   As the officer was questioning him, the boy ``made a move inside
his jacket toward his waist,'' O'Leary said. The officer grabbed
him and, with the help of another officer, forced him to the ground.
   The boy was carrying a 9mm Beretta handgun loaded with 15 shots,
as well as three vials of crack cocaine and a beeper, O'Leary said.
   He was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, a
controlled substance and stolen property (the beeper), resisting
arrest and fare-beating.
   After a hearing at Family Court around noon the boy was released
into the custody of a guardian.

<HEAD>National Safety Council Predicts 370-470 Holiday Highway Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The summer travel season gets under way with the
Memorial Day holiday weekend and the National Safety Council
predicts that up to 470 people would die in traffic accidents.
   ``Traditionally, Memorial Day means increased traffic on the
highways,'' Bernard Hyland of the Chicago-based council said
Thursday.
   The holiday travel period begins at 6 p.m. Friday and runs until
midnight Monday. The safety council predicted that between 370 and
470 people would die in traffic accidents.
   Last year there were 404 traffic fatalities for the three-day
weekend. The Memorial Day record was set in 1968 when 629 people
were killed in traffic accidents over a four-day weekend. The
three-day record of 597 was set in 1969.
   Although gasoline prices have risen nationwide in the past two
months, the safety council said it was unable to say whether that
would keep more people off the highways.
   ``It's hard to say,'' said Terry Miller of the council's
statistical bureau. ``Nobody knows for sure. If the mileage goes
down, the accidents and fatalities would go down. But nobody knows
how the public will react to the increased prices.''

   Members of the Fat Gang had one thing on
their minds after winning the town's annual community dieting
contest.
   Food.
   ``I'm going to have fried potatoes and corn bread and greasy
fish for dinner tonight,'' a 20-pounds-thinner Kem Friga said as a
dreamy smile crossed his face on Thursday.
   Randy Jackson was met with cold stares when he asked his five
Fat Gang friends, ``Anybody want to come over to my house for some
tuna?''
   For the past eight weeks, 65 teams consisting of six members
each dieted and exercised in hopes of shedding enough pounds to win
the $600 top prize in the community Slim-A-Thon contest sponsored
by the Ozarks Medical Center.
   Collectively, the 282 members of the 47 teams that finished the
contest lost 2,640 pounds. Or put another way, West Plains,
population 10,000, lost 18 imaginary residents weighing about 150
pounds each.
   Co-workers, relatives and friends made up teams sporting names
such as Fat Mommas, Eaton 2 Much, Size 5 In Disguise, The Munchers,
Future Thin and Boatmen's Buffet Busters.
   The groups avoided the embarrassment of weighing individually at
periodic weigh-ins by climbing aboard cattle scales together.
   Some contestants let out a loud ``Moos'' when members of
opposing teams got on the scales Thursday for the final weigh-in at
the hospital parking lot.

   City crews discovered gold when they decided to
clean up a statue that hadn't glittered in years.
   The 81-year-old bronze statue of Chief Seattle was stripped of
dirt, grime and corrosion Wednesday to reveal gold leaf applied to
the statue many years ago.
   ``We started stripping and found it,'' said Patricia Tuttle, who
is doing restoration work on the statue for the city. ``It was a
real surprise.''
   The bronze statue located in Tilikum Square was painted with
gold leaf before it was delivered by sculptor James When, Tuttle
said. Records found in Tacoma confirmed the coating.
   Tuttle said it is doubtful that many of the city's approximately
50 bronze statues have gold coats. It is rare to cover bronze with
gold leaf, she said.
   While the name used on the statue is Chief Seattle, the real
name of the Indian chief who befriended white settlers was Chief
Sealth.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Sharply in Tokyo, Stocks Soar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo today, sending stock prices soaring to a record high, traders
said.
   The dollar, which had risen 2.95 yen between Monday and the end
of trading Thursday, finished the week at 140.40 yen, down 1.95 yen
from Thursday's close of 142.35 yen.
   After opening sharply lower at 140.85 yen, the dollar ranged
during the day between 139.90 and 141.10 yen.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's decline to growing cautiousness
about its recent rise.
   ``Most players were beginning to feel the dollar was going up
too far too fast,'' said Masato Sanjo, a dealer at the Tokyo office
of Manufacturers Hanover Trust. ``Also, widespread speculation that
the Bank of Japan will increase its discount rate contributed to
the dollar's decline.''
   The nationally circulated newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported today
that the central bank planned to lift its official discount rate by
0.75 percentage points to 3.25 percent on Wednesday. Bank officials
declined to comment on the report.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which gained 153.57 points Thursday, rose another 186.23 points, or
0.55 percent, to close the week at 34,191.62, another record high.
   Dealers said the rebound in the yen motivated investors to buy
shares which had lost ground this week due to the dollar's sharp
rise.
   ``The market environment is improving,'' said a dealer at a
major Japanese brokerage who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``Once the domestic political situation settles down, I think we
can expect another rally.''
   Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 700
million shares, the same as Thursday.

   The Oscar statuette won last year by
Olympia Dukakis for best supporting actress in ``Moonstruck'' has
been stolen from her home.
   Her husband, Louis Zorich, said nothing else apparently was
taken in the May 19 burglary. Police are investigating the theft.
   ``It's curious, puzzling,'' said Zorich, artistic director at
The Whole Theatre in this northeastern New Jersey city. ``It might

   The gold-plated statuette has a retail value of about $57, Ms.
Dukakis said Thursday, adding that it would be worth more to a
collector. The actress is in Hollywood filming ``Dad,'' which
co-stars Jack Lemmon and Ted Danson.
   Zorich said his wife has ``a good perspective'' and did not seem

   A class field trip turned into a visit to the
juvenile detention center for two sixth-graders after they
allegedly helped themselves to more than $10,000 during a bank tour.
   The boys, ages 12 and 13, were charged with grand theft Thursday
after allegedly stuffing $100 bills in their clothes as their class
toured the vault at NCNB National Bank, said Santa Rosa County
Sheriff's Capt. Terry Hardy.
   Hardy said the boys were taken to the Youth Detention Center in

bank to learn about banking and currency.
   After the visit, the bank manager called to say he was missing

   Nowling said two sheriff's deputies questioned the students
about the reported theft one at a time. He said the boys did not
try to deny that they took the money, and all the money was
recovered.
   Nowling later assembled all the sixth-graders for a lecture.
   ``I think (the incident) may have seemed kind of funny to start

said.
   He said the boys, both recent transfers to the school, would be

   Deputies to the new Soviet congress today
quarreled over legal restrictions on demonstrations after a deputy
complained that anti-riot forces were deployed to break up a public
meeting.
   Conservatives won the fight, and a ban on public gatherings in
Moscow remained in effect.
   Minutes after the Congress of People's Deputies convened for a
second day, sociologist Tatyana Zaslavskaya told her colleagues
that voters had called her early today to report that special
forces broke up a gathering on Moscow's Pushkin Square.
   She said the crowd had assembled to meet deputies from the new
congress and demanded the body vote to lift a ban on unauthorized
public gatherings for the duration of the congress' inaugural
session.
   Soviet law permits city authorities to ban parades and
demonstrations to maintain public order. The restrictions often are
invoked against unofficial political activities.
   Yuri Mityunov, a spokesman for the Democratic Union, a
self-styled opposition party with a few thousand members across the
country, told The Associated Press that Thursday's late-night
meeting was called to appeal for more democracy and to meet Moscow
deputies.
   There were no arrests, but the police ``behaved very
aggressively,'' he said.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was chosen president by the congress
on Thursday, called Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin to the podium
after Zaslavskaya's speech.
   Bakatin said voters had gathered nationwide to discuss the first
day of the congress and no incidents were reported.
   But the Moscow meeting was different, he said, because city
authorities had banned it in advance.
   Bakatin's statement touched off a noisy quarrel on the floor of
the Congress, whose televised proceedings are part of the Soviet
Union's democratic reforms.
   Conservatives from Central Asia applauded loudly to drown out
podium statements by Moscow reformers Sergei Stankevich and Andrei
D. Sakharov, the human rights activist.
   Stankevich, 35, said he went to the square, which in recent
months has become a gathering place for political debate and
frequent site of demonstrations, and found more than 2,000 people
surrounded by police and special anti-riot forces.
   Sakharov said he went to the square Thursday night after a
crying girl telephoned him from the site.
   ``I spoke to these people, it was a very good conversation about
the problems of the congress,'' he said. ``These are our young
people, our future, actively interested in the congress. They asked
us to go there every day after the end of debates.''
   ``We must not surround these people with police units,''
Sakharov said, recalling that at least 20 people died in Soviet
Georgia last month after security forces broke up a
pro-independence demonstration.
   Gorbachev, as presiding officer of the congress, moved to
resolve the dispute by putting to a vote Ms. Zaslavskaya's request
that Moscow city authorities lift the ban on unauthorized public
meetings while the congress meets.
   During the balloting, Gorbachev announced he had received word
from Moscow Communist Party boss Lev N. Zaikov that city
authorities would permit meetings at Luzhniki, a large park and
stadium area in western Moscow.
   That did not satisfy Mityunov, who said his group will meet in
Pushkin Square anyway, and the conservatives in the Congress held
sway.
   The vote was 1,261-831 against lifting the ban; 30 deputies
abstained.

   Technicians today prepared a Delta 2
for its fifth launch attempt as troubleshooters studied an
electrical problem that stopped the rocket a second before liftoff.
   Air Force officials predict it will be at least Wednesday before
they try again to launch the $20 million Delta 2, which is to carry
a military navigation satellite into orbit for the United States
and its allies.
   Experts concluded Thursday that an electrical problem at the
launch pad caused a computer to shut down the main engine of the
Delta 2. Engineers investigating the aborted launch ``determined
that its cause is most likely an electrical problem and (they)
highly suspect ground equipment,'' said Capt. Ken Warren, an Air
Force spokesman.
   A team of engineers from the Air Force and the rocket's maker,
McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. of Huntington Beach, Calif., was
assembled after the scrubbed takeoff Wednesday night of the Delta 2
and its $65 milion payload, a Navstar Global Positioning Satellite.
   A source who requested anonymity said experts found nothing
wrong with the rocket and are investigating the possibility that
thunderstorms, which forced three previous launch postponements,
may have caused a problem in the launch pad's circuitry.
   Officials said a valve stuck shut and starved the Delta 2's main
engine of liquid oxygen, which mixes with a kerosene-type fuel to
propel the rocket. A computer discovered the closed valve and shut
the engine off before it could ignite.
   Launch controllers had sent an engine ignition command, but it
never reached the fuel valve. An open electrical circuit apparently
blocked the command, according to a source.
   The Navstar satellite will tell U.S. and allied military units
their location within 50 feet _ on land, at sea, or in the air _
anywhere on the globe. Launch attempts on Saturday, Sunday and
Tuesday were scrubbed.

   A section of bleachers collapsed during a
high school graduation ceremony and nine spectators were injured,
authorities said.
   ``The minister had just finished the benediction'' Thursday
night when the middle section of the metal-and-wood folding
structure collapsed, said school Superintendent Larry Vibber.
   The injured were transported by ambulance to hospitals in
Pueblo, about 20 miles northwest of this town of about 1,200 people
in eastern Colorado, local fire officials said.
   One woman was in critical care with a head injury; the others
were treated and released.
   The bleachers collapsed about 9 p.m. as the 30 graduating
seniors began to file out of the ceremony and their relatives and
friends stood up to applaud.
   ``There was a lot of whooping and hollering because there were a
lot of kids. They had been kind of excited,'' said Barbara Lotrich,
wife of high school Principal Al Lotrich. ``All of a sudden you see
pushing and shoving and people disappeared.''
   A school board member told everyone to sit down and medical
personnel were summoned to help the injured, Mrs. Lotrich said.
   Rescuers had to lift the bleachers off some of the victims, who
included adults and children.

<HEAD>1,600 Taiwanese Cut Short Visits to China</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-China, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 1,600 Taiwanese cut short their
visits to China and returned home because of spreading unrest
linked to a power struggle in the Chinese leadership, airline
officials reported today.
   Officials of China Airlines, Taiwan's official carrier, and the
Hong Kong-owned Cathay Pacific Airways said they had to assign six
additional flights in the past four days to bring the Taiwanese
back from Hong Kong.
   There are no direct flights between Taiwan and China, and most
Taiwanese fly to Hong Kong or Japan for connecting flights to the
mainland.
   The Nationalist government, which lost a civil war to the
Communists in 1949, opposes official contacts with the Chinese
government.
   But two years ago, it sanctioned visits to China by Taiwanese
for family reunions and later expanded this to include athletes,
journalists, filmmakers and businessmen.
   The United Daily News today reported that violence and looting
occurred in some cities following a student-led democracy movement
that began in Beijing last month and spread throughout China.
   Hsiao Wen-pin, a retired soldier who returned Thursday, said he
and his wife cut short their visit to his hometown in Guiyang in
southern China because the city was a ``dead town,'' the newspaper
reported.
   Hsiao said residents locked themselves indoors to escape street
violence, and he witnessed workers looting a store, the newspaper
reported.
   The student movement brought into the open a power struggle in
the Chinese leadership between hardliners, led by Premier Li Peng,
and moderates, headed by Communist Party Secretary-General Zhao
Ziyang. Zhao was reported under house arrest today, and sources
said he was stripped of his party post.

   A 9-year-old boy attacked by a German
shepherd two years ago has been awarded $909,411 by his
grandparents' insurer.
   The dog owned by the boy's grandparents, Anthony and Cecilia
Recklitis, mauled Brian Fite on July 15, 1987, as he was playing in
their back yard.
   Bucks County Court Judge Paul R. Beckert this week approved an
out-of-court settlement between Fite's parents, Mark and Nancy
Fite, and Allstate Life Insurance, the Recklitis' insurers.
   The boy will receive 48 annual payments beginning on his 18th
birthday in 1997. By 2044 he will have received $909,411.
   ``He was very nearly killed by this dog,'' said the parents'
attorney, Nathan Criste.
   The boy was hospitalized for four days with face and head
injuries that required extensive cosmetic surgery, according to
court records.
   Mrs. Recklitis declined to discuss the suit when contacted at
her home.

<HEAD>One Dead in Worst Melee in Seven Years At Folsom Prison</HEAD>

   The worst violence at Folsom Prison in
seven years left one inmate dead and five seriously injured.
   Prison officials said 25 to 30 inmates battled Thursday morning
in an exercise yard occupied by about 300 prisoners. Several had
weapons made within the prison.
   Spokeswoman Lt. Cammy Voss said three suffered gunshot wounds
and two stab wounds. The guards fired 10 shots from their
second-story posts to break up the brawl.
   A strip search of all prisoners in the yard revealed 43 men with
minor wounds. But officers said some of those probably happened
earlier and elsewhere but hadn't yet been reported.
   The fight appeared to have been racially motivated, Voss said.
Mostly black and Hispanic prisoners and a couple of white prisoners
were involved.
   But it was apparently not gang-related, she said. ``We don't
know why it erupted,'' she added.
   The slain inmate was identified as Michael Coleman, 29. He had
arrived April 20 to begin a four-year term for armed robbery in Los
Angeles County. He died of stab wounds 20 minutes after the fight
began.
   Officers locked all of the maximum-security prison's 7,000
inmates into their cells after the fight broke out at the prison 20
miles east of Sacramento.
   Facility B, where the melee occurred, is one of three in a wing
that opened in October 1986, next to the 119-year-old stone walls.
   It houses about 1,000 prisoners considered to be among
California's most violent.
   Voss said it was the worst violence in the history of the new
wing, and perhaps the worst at the entire Folsom Prison since seven
years ago when racial violence, largely between Hispanic and black
prison gang members, led to an extended lockup.

   A suspected drug dealer who let his
fingers do the walking when he tried to collect a debt ended up in
jail after accidentally dialing a police detective's pager.
   The detective returned the message and was told, ``You owe me
$200 and if you don't pay me back, I'll break your legs,''
Narcotics Sgt. Ed Hill said Thursday. Hill said the man made it
clear he was trying to collect on an unpaid drug debt.
   The suspect had tried to call an associate but missed by one
digit, Hill said.
   The detective arranged to meet the man, but instead he was met
by two undercover officers who bought his drugs and then arrested
him on drug and firearm charges.

<TEXT>
   Scattered severe thunderstorms extended from the lower Great
Lakes into the Ohio Valley early today, hours after a wave of
thunderstorms caused flooding and tornadoes in Indiana and Ohio.
   Six people suffered storm-related injuries in central Indiana
Thursday, including a Markleville woman who injured her leg when a
tree crashed through the living room of her mobile home,
authorities said.
   Elsewhere in the state, a tornado touched down in Portland
Mills, and strong thunderstorm winds blew down a barn and trees in
Jay County and knocked out windows at a courthouse in Rockville.
Golf ball-size hail pounded Gaston, Fishers and northern sections
of Indianapolis.
   By early today, up to 5 inches of rain had fallen across central
Indiana since Thursday afternoon. People had to be rescued from
their cars because of flooding along creeks in northwest
Indianapolis and flood waters were waist deep in Carmel.
   Heavy rain also fell across parts of west-central Ohio, and
roads were flooded across parts of northeast Ohio.
   A tornado in northwest Ohio in Fayette, about 30 miles west of
Toledo, damaged buildings, ripped the tops off trees and turned
around cars and blew out their windows early Thursday, authorities
said. No injuries were reported.
   Severe thunderstorms also rumbled across southern and eastern
Missouri, with golf ball-size hail falling at Brazito, Buffalo and
near Monett. Thunderstorm winds reached 60 mph near Owensville, Mo.
   Severe thunderstorms were developing across Oklahoma and showers
were scattered across eastern Colorado, northwest Kansas and
eastern North Dakota.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in Oklahoma, Arkansas, the Tennessee and Ohio valleys, the Great
Lakes, New York and much of New England; widely scattered showers
in the Pacific Northwest and western Montana; and widely scattered
thunderstorms in southern Florida.
   Predicted highs: 50s and 60s in the Pacific Northwest, the
northern and central Rockies, the northern Plains and the upper
Great Lakes; 90s from the middle and southern Atlantic Coast across
the Gulf Coast and most of Texas; 100s in southwest Texas and the
desert Southwest; 70s and 80s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 31

<HEAD>Dollar Down in Market Correction, Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was down sharply in moderate European
trading today, a trend analysts saw as an expected correction after
a strong surge. Gold prices rose.
   Analysts said the dollar remained fundamentally strong, but that
it needed to come down to about 1.9620 marks before another rise
could be anticipated. The dollar traded at 1.9648 against the West
German currency this morning.
   ``I think the market players feel they can relax a little now
after the dollar's surprising rush earlier this week,'' said one
trader in Milan, Italy.
   Still, the dollar's growing strength raised a question for West
Germany and Japan, which must decide whether to raise interest
rates.
   ``It's a big dilemma for the central banks,'' said another
Italian analyst. ``Higher interest rates will have a positive
effect on exchange rates, but a negative effect on inflation.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed down sharply at 140.85 yen, dropping 1.95
yen from Thursday's close. During the Tokyo trading day, the dollar
moved as low as 139.90 yen. Later, in London, the dollar drifted
lower to 140.15 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.9648 West German marks, down from 1.9965
   _1.7225 Swiss francs, down from 1.7650
   _6.6588 French francs, down from 6.7675
   _2.2243 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2480
   _1,242.00 Italian lire, down from 1,444.50
   _1.2040 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2105
   In London, the British pound traded at $1.60 up from about $1.58
late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $365.75 a troy ounce, up
from $364.75 late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $367.20.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.55 an ounce to a closing bid
of $366.41.
   Silver bullion in London rose to a bid price of $5.34 a troy
ounce, from $5.26 bid late Thursday.

<HEAD>Government To Hire New Doctors To Break Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIJAY JOSHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said it will hire 500
physicians to break an 11-day strike by doctors who took to the
streets today singing ``We shall overcome.''
   More than 3,500 doctors at New Delhi's 11 government hospitals
walked off their jobs in a wage dispute May 16, severely curtailing
free and low-cost medical services for the capital's poorest people.
   Health Ministry spokesman D.N. Chaturvedi said on Thursday that
government is authorizing administrators at all 11 hospitals to
replace the strikers, temporarily or permanently. He said 500
doctors will be hired.
   Dr. Rohit Parasher, a strike leader, dismissed the government's
latest move to end the strike. He said the strike would continue
indefinitely and the doctors were launching ``novel protests,''
including street plays and torchlight processions.
   The strikers staged a street play today outside Lok Nayak Jai
Prakash Narain Hospital, parodying the government and the state-run
television, Doordarshan. The doctors have accused Doordarshan of
biased coverage of the strike.
   At the end of the play, a chorus sang ``We shall overcome'' in
Hindi as striking doctors and supporters banged tin drums and
clapped their hands.
   Since Monday, the strikers have been running outpatient clinics
in tents outside nine hospitals. Parasher said the doctors were
distributing free medicine as ``an expression of our deep anguish
and concern for our patients.''
   The government hospitals have remained open, staffed by 800
senior doctors, but most patients were discharged on the eve of the
strike and few new ones have been admitted.
   The New Delhi doctors were joined in the strike by 1,400 others
in Chandigarh, Pondicherry, Banaras and Aligarh.
   The walkout followed a deadlock in negotiations with the Health
Ministry.
   The striking doctors earned from $200 to $270 a month. They want
a pay increase of $53 a month.
   They also want the government to increase their allowance for
not maintaining private practice from $16 a month to $40. Doctors
who work for the government are not allowed to have private
practices to supplement their incomes.

   A man who killed a widow and stole her
Christmas presents was executed in Alabama's electric chair early
today as inmates in nearby cells protested and one yelled,
``Murderers, murderers.''
   Michael Lindsey, 28, was pronounced dead by two doctors at 12:10
a.m. at Holman Prison near Atmore. The execution was the fourth in
Alabama and the 111th in the nation since the U.S. Supreme Court
allowed states to resume use of the death penalty in 1976.
   ``He had made peace with his maker,'' said the Rev. Robert
Smith, who was in the room adjacent to the death chamber and spent
time with Lindsey earlier in the day.
   Lindsey was sentenced to death for the 1981 stabbing and
shooting death of Rosemary Zimlich Rutland, 64, of Mobile, who was
bound, gagged, stabbed and shot. Prosecutors said Lindsey killed
her because she recognized him.
   Warden Charlie Jones asked Lindsey if he had any final words
once he had been strapped into the chair, and the condemned man
shook his head and closed his eyes.
   In nearby cells, inmates shouted in protest and one yelled,
``Murderers, murderers!''
   John Hale, a prison system spokesman, said that earlier Thursday
Lindsey visited with his sister, Cynthia Murphy, and his brother,
Tyrone Lindsey, for about three hours.
   Prison officials said the inmate also spent his final hours
watching movies on a videocassette player in his cell adjacent to
the electric chair.
   ``Throughout the afternoon, he seemed to be accepting his fate
and was very reserved,'' Thigpen said.
   The Supreme Court refused Thursday to grant an emergency request
for a stay of execution, and Gov. Guy Hunt turned down a request
for clemency.
   Mrs. Rutland was killed Dec. 14, 1981, and Christmas presents
were taken from her home. Police said Lindsey, who lived in a
rental house directly behind Mrs. Rutland's home, was captured at a
shopping mall using the victims' credit cards.
   Alabama's last electrocution was Aug. 28, 1987, when Wayne
Eugene Ritter was put to death for his role in the robbery and
killing of a Mobile pawn shop owner.

   Comedian Bob Hope was serenaded with
a chorus of ``Happy Birthday'' sung by 3,000 people on the flight
deck of the aircraft carrier Yorktown.
   ``Age doesn't mean a damn thing,'' said Hope, whose 86th
birthday is on Monday. ``When I wake up in the morning, I don't
feel my age _ in fact I don't feel anything till noon ... then it's
time for my nap.''
   Hope visited this Charleston suburb on Thursday to play a round
of golf at the second annual William Westmoreland Open at Patriots
Point Links. Organizers hoped to raise upwards of $20,000 for the
Vietnam Veterans Institute.
   Westmoreland, who commanded U.S. forces in Vietnam, lives in
Charleston.
   The retired general introduced Hope as a man of ``exceptional
character and burning patriotism.''
   ``There is nobody that any veteran _ particularly the veterans
of Vietnam _ know and respect more than Bob Hope,'' said
Westmoreland, who noted that Hope made eight trips to Vietnam to
entertain troops.
   Hope, in turn, said Westmoreland always treated him well in
Vietnam.
   ``He even put a phone in my foxhole in case I wanted to call
Dial-a-Prayer,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A mother angry that an air conditioner fell out
of her fifth-story window threw her 2-year-old daughter out after
it, killing the girl, police said.
   The mother, Jessica Sanchez, told police that the tot tumbled
out accidentally after the air conditioner fell Wednesday. But
detectives did not believe her and she was charged Thursday with
murder.
   Two-year-old Rachel Sanchez died Wednesday night at Bronx
Lebanon Hospital of a fractured skull and other broken bones, said
Capt. James J. Campbell.
   Mrs. Sanchez, 29, and her husband, Thomas Sanchez, 33, were also
charged with endangering the welfare of the child, because two
other children, ages 1 and 3, showed signs of abuse, police said.
   They were turned over to state welfare authorities. The couple
also have three older children who live with relatives.
   A neighbor, Valencia Gil, told reporters that the mother had
recently thrown a puppy and two kittens out of a window to punish
the children.
   Under questioning by detectives, Mrs. Sanchez gave conflicting
accounts of how Rachel fell, Campbell said.
   She originally told police that the child had been playing near
an air conditioner when it fell out of the window and the child
tumbled out after it. Later, she said that Rachel was clinging to
her leg, and in an effort to force the child away, the mother shook
her leg so forcefully that the child tumbled away and fell out the
window.
   However, ``the physical layout of the apartment would not be
conducive to that kind of a story,'' Campbell said. ``We feel there
is more to it.''

<HEAD>Battle Shaping Up Over Custody of Carmina Salcido</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused of killing seven people,
including his wife and two daughters, will ask a court to award
permanent custody rights over his surviving daughter to his Mexican
relatives, his attorney says.
   Ramon Salcido, a former winery worker, also is accused of
slashing 3-year-old Carmina's throat and leaving her to die in a
dump and rock quarry with her sisters. Carmina recovered and is
living with her maternal grandfather.
   Public Defender Marteen Miller said Salcido is claiming his
mother and his siblings have the same right to rear Carmina as the
relatives of his dead wife, Angela Richards Salcido.
   Salcido's mother, Valentina Bojorquez Armendariz, lives in Los
Mochis, northwest Mexico, and is married to a fisherman, Ebitasio
Seja, Salcido's stepfather. Salcido also has two adult sisters and
two adult brothers living in or near Los Mochis, Salcido's hometown.
   On May 10, Superior Court Judge Arnold Rosenfield granted
temporary custody of Carmina to Robert Richards, her maternal
grandfather, after the toddler's release from Petaluma Valley
Hospital.
   The Press Democrat of Santa Rosa said in story published today
that Salcido will contest any attempt by the court to grant
permanent custody to anyone other than members of his family.
   ``She's my daughter and I love her. She's everything I have,''
Salcido said in a telephone call to the newspaper Monday night.
   Rosenfield set a hearing for Tuesday to determine Carmina's
legal status and permanent custody. Salcido probably will attend
the hearing, Miller said.
   ``I'm appalled he's trying to maintain any relationship with her
at all,'' said Richards' lawyer, James DeMartini. ``It's beyond my
comprehension.''
   Salcido is accused of killing Carmina's two sisters, Sofia, 4,
and Teresa, 2. The other victims included Salcido's mother-in-law,
Marian Louise Richards; his sisters-in-law, Ruth Richards, 12, and
Marie Richards, 8; and a co-worker at Grand Cru Vineyards, Tracy
Toovey.

   Big-event programming for May and expiration of
the effects of the 1988 scriptwriters strike helped the three
networks at least slow the rate of audience erosion that has
plagued them in recent seasons.
   The networks had a combined average audience share of 65 for the
May sweep, 2 percent lower than May 1988, according to A.C. Nielsen
Co. ratings. Their combined rating was 37.8, compared with 38.7 in
May 1988.
   The decline was less than the 3 percent rate of audience loss
the networks suffered in the 1988-89 season compared with the
1987-88 season. That loss has been chalked up to the effects of the
strike, which delayed the start of the season, and inroads by
cable, videocassettes and independent channels.
   May is one of four ``sweeps'' months a year when local
television ratings are measured for use in negotiating future
advertising rates. The networks tend to load their schedules with
special programming to help local affiliates.
   NBC, which just completed its fourth season win in a row, won
the May sweep, too, with an average rating of 14.6. CBS had an
11.8. Even though ABC had the two top-rated shows in the sweep, the
made-for-TV movie ``Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica
McClure'' and the sitcom ``Roseanne,'' it came in third with an
11.4.
   NBC's two-parter, ``I Know My First Name Is Steven,'' was the
highest-rated multipart movie of the sweep, with a 24.5 rating and
39 share. It was the highest-rated multiparter for NBC since
``Fatal Vision'' in November 1984, and the highest-rated
multiparter on any network since ``Lonesome Dove'' on CBS in
February.
   ABC's five-part conclusion of ``War and Remembrance'' was the
second highest-rated multiparter of the sweep, though it had a
so-so 14.9 rating.
   ``Everybody's Baby,'' based on the real-life 1987 rescue of a
Midland, Texas, baby from an abandoned water well, had a 22.9
rating and 36 share to become the top-rated show of the sweep.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' beat out NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' for second
place, which NBC attributed to the effects of sunlight. ``Cosby''
had a lower rating, but higher share, because of its 8 p.m. EDT
time period. Fewer people are in front of their sets in the early
evening because it's still light outside. ``Roseanne'' has a 9 p.m.
time period. And despite the performance of ``Roseanne,'' which was
pre-empted at times during the sweep, ABC lost Tuesday night to NBC.
   NBC won its 16th sweep in 17 sweeps. ABC had broken its winning
streak in February 1988 with the Winter Olympics. NBC has become
such a juggernaut, it is having a hard time finding new
superlatives.
   Gerald Jaffe, NBC's vice president for research projects, said
he was so impressed that NBC had won five nights a week during the
May sweep, he had his staff check to see when a network last

   Syria has reinforced its 40,000 troops in
Lebanon with an armored tank brigade, and Syrian fighter planes
flew over Christian positions today, Israeli and Lebanese media
reported.
   Israel's Cabinet met in special session to discuss the troop
moves, Israel radio said. An Israeli official, who requested
anonymity, confirmed a special Cabinet session was convened
Thursday night but refused to give details.
   Israeli officials said they were watching the situation closely
but saw no reason to interfere as long as Israel's northern border
was not affected.
   ``As long as we don't feel directly threatened, there is no way
Israel is going to intervene,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman
Alon Liel.
   It was not immediately clear how the Syrian moves would affect
the fighting in Lebanon. More than 350 people have been killed and
nearly 1,400 wounded since Christian and Moslem forces began
shelling each other's positions March 8 in the latest round of
fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   The Syrian reinforcements also came as the Arab League met in
Morocco to discuss ways of enforcing a cease-fire it declared in
Lebanon on May 11.
   A spokesman for Christian forces in Lebanon said two Israeli
warplanes flew over the Chouf mountains southeast of Beirut today
and drew heavy anti-aircraft fire from Syrian-backed Druse
militiamen. No hits were observed, he said.
   The media reports did not say how many additional Syrian troops
were moved into eastern Lebanon, but the daily Yediot Ahronot said
they included 40 tanks. The troop movements were part of an
exercise involving helicopter commandos backed by aircraft and
tanks, the newspaper and radio reports said.
   The Syrian exercise was reportedly taking place in the Bekaa
Valley near the Syrian border and not near the Golan Heights, which
would be of major concern to Israel. But Christian radio reports in
Lebanon said Syrian aircraft were flying over Beirut and the
Christian enclave.
   A spokesman for the Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun,
said four Syrian jet fighters flew at high altitudes ``from the
northern border to Beirut for more than an hour beginning at 6:15
a.m.''
   ``They veered off over Beirut and headed back north. They
carried out the practice repeatedly,'' said the spokesman.
   He said Christian army units did not open fire at the jets.
   Motta Gur, a former army chief of staff, said on Israel radio
that the troop movements seemed more a political move aimed at Arab
leaders attending the Arab League summit in Casablanca than a
threat to Israel's security.
   ``We have to watch the situation closely, but in my assessment
it's more an inner-Arab issue. The fact is that in Casablanca they
got into difficulties,'' he said. The summit is trying to find a
compromise to Syria's refusal to end its fight with Christian armed
forces.
   Syria has rejected calls from Iraq to withdraw its forces from
Lebanon to help end that nation's civil war. Syrian soldiers have
been in Lebanon since 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate.
   Israel maintains a six-to-10-mile-wide security zone in southern
Lebanon.
   Military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Israel
had not raised the alert status of its troops along the border.
   Syria's movement of anti-aircraft missiles into Lebanon in 1981
touched off a crisis, and the two armies clashed during Israel's
invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Tensions also increased after Syria
sent troops back into Beirut.

   About 8,000 commercial radio stations nationwide
went silent for 30 seconds today to mark the beginning of a $100
million advertising campaign aimed at highlighting what life would
be like without radio.
   At 7:42 a.m. EDT, actor James Earl Jones told listeners that
``for the next 30 seconds this station and others would like you to
imagine your life without radio. Imagine if all your days sounded
like this. ...''
   The following 30 seconds were filled with silence. Jones then
cut in and said, ``Thirty seconds seems like a long time, doesn't
it? Now think how radio fills that silence for you.''
   About 80 percent of the nation's commercial stations
participated in the opening stage of the yearlong campaign, the
Radio Advertising Bureau said.
   The simultaneous promotion is the largest in the history of
radio, said Danny Flamberg of the Radio Advertising Bureau. In
1986, 2,000 radio stations simultaneously broadcast ``We Are The
World'' to promote hunger relief.

<HEAD>Fourteen Sentenced to Death in Slaying of Policeman</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with details, appeal promised. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today sentenced 14
black people to death in the 1985 killing of a black police officer
who was beaten and set on fire by a mob.
   The defendants, singing an African hymn as they marched into
court in the northwest city of Upington, were among 25 people
convicted of murder in the slaying of police Constable Lucas
Sethwala in nearby Paballelo township.
   Under South African law, the death sentence is mandatory for
people convicted of murder unless the judge determines there were
mitigating circumstances.
   The 11 other defendants are to be sentenced next week, but the
judge already has determined there were extenuating circumstances
and the death penalty will not be imposed. Sentencing also is
scheduled for a 26th defendant convicted of attempted murder.
   Most of the 13 men and one women sentenced to death today
proclaimed their innocence during the hearing before Supreme Court
Justice Jan Basson.
   ``I am an elderly woman and have been found guilty for something
I have not done. ... Other people committed this crime,'' said
Evelina de Bruin, 60.
   Only one of the 25, Justice Bekebeke, was found to have
committed the act that killed Sethwala, said defense lawyer Andy
Durbach.
   She said the sentences will be appealed. The group is the
largest ever sentenced to death in a single crime in South Africa,
she said.
   Bekebeke, 24, did not maintain his innocence in his address to
the court today but said the case was ``based on racial prejudice.''
   Because the death sentence is mandatory, the defendants knew
their sentences because the judge already had ruled on Thursday
that there were no extenuating circumstances.
   Prosecutors said the 25 people were part of a crowd of 300 who
pelted the victim's house with stones. At one point he fired a gun
out the window, wounding a small boy, which defense lawyers said
incited the crowd to assault the man and set him on fire.
   Basson noted that 3,000 people had gathered on a soccer field in
the township the previous day to protest rent hikes and other
actions by township authorities. He said the killing was
politically motivated, part of a conspiracy to attack authorities.
   He rejected defense arguments that the individual defendants
could not be held accountable for the actions of the crowd. One of
those convicted was described by witnesses as a best friend of the
victim.
   Defense lawyer Anton Lubowski said 10 defendants were sentenced
to death but found to not have physically contributed to the
officer's death.
   The 25 were convicted of murder in April 1988 under the
principle of common purpose, which holds them responsible for the
actions of a crowd if they were part of the group.
   The same principle was used against the Sharpeville Six, a group
of black men and women convicted of slaying a black town council
member during the nationwide political unrest that gripped black
townships from 1984-86.
   After an international campaign, President P.W. Botha last year
commuted the death sentences for the Sharpeville Six and replaced
them with lengthy prison terms.

<HEAD>No-Contest Plea By Mother of Baby Left on Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mother who abandoned her newborn
daughter in a jetliner's restroom before a cross-country flight has
pleaded no contest to felony child endangerment.
   Christine LoCasto, 27, of New York City, entered her plea
Thursday after a prosecutor promised not to seek a prison term.
Sentencing was set for Aug. 9.
   She originally pleaded innocent.
   The baby, Alyssa, was found under a restroom sink July 13
shortly after the jetliner landed in San Francisco and the
passengers departed. The child had apparently been born shortly
before the plane took off from Newark, N.J.
   The child, now 10 months old, is in the custody of her paternal
grandparents in New York.
   Mrs. LoCasto was accompanied by her husband, Louis, when she
entered the plea in San Mateo County Superior Court. The couple
have two other children.
   LoCasto, who was on the flight with his wife last July, was
apparently unaware she was pregnant and did not know she had given
birth in the restroom.
   Judge Margaret Kemp gave no indication she will accept
prosecutor Steve Wagstaffe's recommendation against prison. The
felony charge carries a maximum penalty of six years in state
prison, six years' probation and a $10,000 fine.
   The prosecutor noted that Mrs. LoCasto had no criminal record
and that the baby was unharmed. And he said he still does not know
why the mother abandoned the baby.
   Her attorney, Richard Bennett, said Mrs. LoCasto's explanation
was ``very complicated'' and that he did not want to invade her
privacy by talking about it.

   A city bus driver argued with a passenger over an
unpaid fare and then shot the man to death as he was leaving,
authorities said.
   Chauncey J. Plummer, 37, a Dallas bus driver for 10 years, was
charged with murder Thursday in the death of David Hayden, 25. He
was released on $25,000 bond.
   Plummer picked up Hayden and a woman on a downtown street
Wednesday, said Ron Whittington, spokesman for Dallas Area Rapid
Transit. The driver told authorities that in his rearview mirror he
saw the woman hand her bus pass to Hayden, who then tried to use it
for his fare.
   The driver told Hayden he could not use the pass, an argument
ensued and Plummer ordered Hayden off the bus. The man was shot in
the back with a revolver as he exited, then he stumbled off the bus
and collapsed, witnesses said.
   The driver radioed for help, then waited in the bus for police
to arrive and surrendered without incident.
   Hayden died Wednesday evening at Baylor University Medical
Center.
   Because of the shooting, DART is reviewing its procedure for
checking drivers for weapons, and may begin placing plainclothes
police officers on routes where problems have been reported.
   Drivers on Thursday expressed concern about the incident.
   ``They wanted us to be aware that there are some problems on the
routes and we need to address those,'' Whittington said. ``That
does not condone what has allegedly happened, but we're trying to
be sensitive to the drivers.''
   Plummer has been assaulted twice on the bus route in the past
couple of years, once breaking his hand and the other time
suffering a black eye, Whittington said.

   About 300 radical students adopted
tactics used by Chinese protesters and began a hunger protest today
to demand the government admit that police killed a student leader.
   Students chanted anti-government slogans and songs at Myongdong
Cathedral to call for the fall of President Roh Tae-woo's
government and demand police acknowlege they fatally tortured
student leader Lee Chol-gyu.
   ``Overthrow the murder regime!'' and ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!''
protesters chanted. Riot police watched but made no move to
intervene.
   About 100 students chanted slogans at the Roman Catholic
cathedral's main gate. The other students rested in the compound or
took part in discussion groups, taking water but no food. Students
stayed out of the cathedral and administration buildings.
   Radical student leaders said they were using the same tactics as
Chinese students fasting in Beijing to demand the introduction of
democracy and other sweeping changes. Some students claimed they
would fast to the death if their demands were not met.
   ``We are more determined than the students fasting in China,'' a
student leader told a news conference after the protesters moved
into the cathedral compound overnight.
   In recent days, newspapers have pointed out the differences
between the pro-democracy Chinese protesters and the anti-Western
Korean students, who demand an ill-defined ``workers and farmers
state.''
   The newspapers have commended the Chinese for their peaceful
tactics and urged Korean students to end violent protests. The
editorials have urged Korean students to abandon their leftist
views, saying the Chinese protesters are inspired by opposition to
communism.
   ``It is regrettable that some students and intelluctals in our
country are obsessed with socialism, an old ideology that communist
nations are trying to reform,'' the moderate Jooang Daily News said
Thursday.
   Radical students in South Korea lack popular support because of
their extreme views and violent tactics. Some student groups have
been trying to switch tactics after six riot troopers were killed
May 3 in a clash in the southern city of Pusan.
   A seventh riot trooper injured in the May 3 clash died Thursday
night, police said. The deaths outraged the public.
   Radical students and dissidents claim Lee was tortured and
killed by police and are demanding the government acknowledge a
cover-up. Lee's body was found May 10 in a reservoir near the
southern city of Kwangju.
   Police and government officials deny any official involvement in
Lee's death, although police tried to detain him at a roadblock
just before he disappeared. The government says an autopsy proves
Lee was not tortured, and officials speculate he slipped into the
reservoir and drowned.
   The protesters in the cathedral compound today put up posters
with color pictures of Lee's bloated body.
   Crowds of up to 100,000 people marched in Kwangju last week to
demand the government admit police killed Lee. The demonstrations
also called for Roh's fall for the bloody suppression of a 1980
uprising in Kwangju. Radicals claim the United States was involved
in Kwangju and are demanding expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops
based in South Korea under a defense treaty.
   Protests in Korea often include the burning of U.S. flags, which
Culture and Information Minsiter Choe Byung-yul deplored today as
``an uncivilized act'' intended to damage Seoul's friendship with
Washington.
   Also today, the government announced Foreign Minister Choi
Ho-joong will lead a new government body of 10 vice ministers with
authority to decide on U.S.-related issues involving American
troops, anti-Americanism and trade.
   Seoul has been seeking greater control over crimes involving
American troops and other matters.

<HEAD>Psychologist Robert Sears Dies At 80; Directed Study of Gifted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Psychologist Robert R. Sears, who was
a subject in a pioneering study of gifted children and grew up to
become director of that study, has died. He was 80.
   Sears, a professor emeritus at Stanford University, died Monday
at his home.
   Sears was chairman of Stanford's psychology department from 1953
until 1961. In 1956, he took over a long-term study of gifted
people when its original director, professor Lewis Terman, died.
   Sears himself was one of the 1,500 children with high IQ scores
selected by Terman for the study, which began in 1921. It was
intended to see whether bright children were prone to social
maladjustment or mental or physical illness as they grew up.
   In 1986, Sears said that researchers found that the so-called
``Terman kids'' did better than average in some ways _ making more
money, for example _ but did not have better marriages.
   ``Their family lives have been no better than the general
population,'' he wrote. ``Brains don't guarantee some kinds of
outcomes in life.''
   The study will go on ``until the last person dies,'' Sears said
three years ago.
   Sears, a past president of the American Psychological
Association, is survived by his wife, Pauline; a son; a daughter;
and several grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   The Illinois Senate shot down a package
of measures that would have toughened handgun laws and imposed a
limited ban on semiautomatic assault weapons.
   By a 2-1 margin, lawmakers Thursday defeated bills requiring
handgun owners to register their weapons with state police, obtain
identification cards, and notify authorities of change of address.
   The Senate fell two votes short of banning semiautomatic weapons
using magazines or ammunition belts containing more than 10 rounds.
California recently enacted a similar ban.
   ``People are more concerned with the will of the National Rifle
Association than they are of the desires of their own
constituents,'' said William Marovitz, one of two sponsors of the
bills.
   Sen. David Barkhausen said the bill's proposal to register the
guns would have cost $7.6 million and created a bureaucratic
nightmare.
   Currently, people may own any type of firearm with a single
firearm owner's identification card. The rejected measure would
have required a separate card for handguns.
   The Senate did approve a measure sponsored by Marovitz that
would allow revocation of a firearm owner's identification card if
a judge determines that the owner presents a ``clear and present
danger'' to himself or others.
   Another rejected measure would have banned former mental
patients from owning handguns.
   Gun control advocates had hoped their efforts would gain after
incidents like the shooting spree last May 20 in a Winnetka
elementary school. Laurie Dann, a mentally disturbed woman, shot
five students, killing one, before committing suicide.

   Sudanese rebels will meet officials of the
Khartoum government next month to discuss ending a six-year civil
war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people, a rebel
spokesman said today.
   Lam Akol, international relations director of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, said Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's government
requested the meeting, which will take place at the rebels'
headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   ``Our position has not changed,'' Akol said in Nairobi. ``But
they asked for a meeting, and we said it would be OK.''
   On Thursday, university professor Hamad Baggadi announced in
Khartoum that he would lead the government's peace committee to a
June 10 meeting with the southern-based rebels. Baggadi is a member
of Mahdi's governing Umma party.
   Akol said the rebels want Mahdi to lift the state of emergency,
abrogate Sudan's military pacts with other nations, and convene a
conference of all Sudanese political parties to draft a new
constitution. The second demand is aimed at Libya, which has helped
Sudan fight the southern rebellion.
   Mahdi already has formed a new, broader-based government and won
Parliament's approval to suspend harsh Islamic laws _ moves made
under pressure from the military, which wants to negotiate an end
to the insurrection.
   Rebel leader John Garang recently announced a monthlong
unilateral cease-fire to permit the United Nations to get emergency
food and other supplies to southern Sudan, where 100,000 people
face starvation from war-induced famine.
   The rebels took up arms in 1983 against the Moselm-dominated
government, demanding social and economic reforms for the southern
minority, who are mainly Christians and animist.

<HEAD>Consumer Spending Shoots Up 1.1 Percent in April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer spending shot up 1.1 percent in
April, the biggest advance in nearly a year, outpacing a 0.4
percent increase in personal income, the government reported today.
   The combination of a strong spending increase and the sluggish
income gain produced a sharp reduction in the personal savings
rate, which dropped to 5.3 percent last month from a three-year
high of 6.3 percent during the previous month, the Commerce
Department said.
   The April increase in personal income was the smallest gain
since income fell 0.2 percent last November. Personal income had
risen a strong 0.8 percent in March and 1.0 percent in February.
   Last month's increase in personal income, to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $4.37 trillion, would have been stronger
were it not for decreases in farm subsidies over the past two
months, coupled with bonuses for autoworkers and retroactive Social
Security benefit payments that inflated March's figure.
   Excluding those special factors, personal income advanced a
strong 0.8 percent in April after rising 0.7 percent in March.
   The 1.1 percent increase in personal consumer expenditures, to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.42 trillion, was the biggest
advance since a 1.3 percent increase was registered last June.
   Expenditures had risen just 0.3 percent in March and 0.4 percent
in February, causing analysts to attribute part of the current
slowdown in economic growth to slackening consumer spending.
   Consumer spending is closely watched as indicator of the
economy's health because it accounts for two-thirds of overall
economic activity.
   The rebound in spending last month was partly attributed to a
rise in auto sales, which perked up somewhat in April after
carmakers launched a round of rebates and cut-rate financing deals
to lure customers back to showrooms.
   The pickup in auto sales was the primary power behind a 3.2
percent increase last month in consumer spending on durable goods _
``big ticket'' items expected to last at least three years.
   Spending on durable goods last month rose to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $467.1 trillion after declining during the
previous two months, when auto sales had been weak.
   Purchases of non-durable goods, meanwhile, rose 0.7 percent last
month and spending on services rose 0.8 percent.
   Disposable, or after-tax income held virtually even last month
after rising 0.3 percent in March. After-tax income was held down
by a higher-than-usual April surge in federal income tax payments
that was partly attributed to the after-effects of the 1986 tax
overhaul.
   The increase in tax payments contributed to the decline in the
personal savings rate, which represents savings as a percentage of
after-tax income.
   Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, rose 0.6
percent in April to a seasonally adjusted $2.61 trillion on an
annual basis.

<TEXT>
   A rainstorm aided firefighters battling a
10-day-old blaze in Everglades National Park today but lightning
started several small fires in neighboring Big Cypress National
Preserve, officials said.
   Firefighters said they hoped to declare the 85,000-acre
Everglades blaze contained by sunset, with only isolated patches of
smoke and fire remaining.
   ``Our fire is about 85 percent contained,'' said forest ranger
Paul Krumland, who expected the fire to be declared contained by 6
p.m.
   Thursday afternoon's rain ``did more good than bad for us,''
Krumland said. ``But bad lightning strikes did come down in Big
Cypress National Preserve, and they're working on that now.''
   At Big Cypress, which is west of the Everglades, spokesman Kevin
Walsh said 20 firefighters worked through the night to contain a
300-acre fire that began earlier. In addition, he said, lightning
began eight smaller fires Thursday, each covering only a few acres.
   The Everglades fire is centered about 30 miles southwest of
Miami. Nearly 250 firefighters from around the country have fought
the blaze since it was started by lightning May 16.
   The marshy sawgrass and isolated hardwood hammocks in the area
hadn't burned in more than 30 years, said park spokeswoman Pat
Tolle. Such fires before the rainy season normally cause only
limited damage by burning off the top of the grass.
   ``We'll see,'' she said. ``As soon as the summer rains begin,
there'll be a lush regrowth of the sawgrass.''
   On Tuesday, the fire briefly threatened the Miccosukee Indian
village at the park's northern edge. But then it shifted direction,
and heavy smoke kept the park's neighboring Shark Valley visitor
center closed until Thursday morning.
   About 400 wildfires have scorched 350,000 acres of grass and
brush in southern Florida since last October, according to state
estimates.

<HEAD>Sex Charges Dropped Against Former Day Care Operator</HEAD>

   Prosecutors have dropped sex-abuse charges
against a former day-care center operator who said she was elated
but felt ``violated'' by more than two years of investigations and
a trial.
   Sandra Fabiano had been charged with sexually abusing four
preschool-age girls at her two day-care centers in suburban
Chicago. The first trial, involving one of the girls, ended in
acquittal March 30.
   Mary Ellen Cagney and Richard Burke, assistant Cook County
state's attorneys, said the remaining charges were dropped Thursday
to spare child witnesses from the trauma of a trial.
   ``I feel like a champagne bottle has just been opened,'' said
Mrs. Fabiano, 42.
   ``I am a free woman now, but I felt that I didn't have any
rights throughout the whole thing,'' she said. ``I felt I was
violated as was my family and my children.''
   She accused prosecutors of mishandling the case and said she
believes the charges were dropped because the state had no evidence
in the remaining cases.
   But Ms. Cagney said the investigation was ``very thorough'' and
``sensitive to the rights of the family.''
   ``She was not locked up,'' Ms. Cagney said. ``We were very aware
of her rights and those of her family throughout the
investigation.''
   Mrs. Fabiano's lawyers have filed a lawsuit asking that a judge
overturn the state's decision to revoke her day-care license. And
the parents of the four girls have sued Mrs. Fabiano.
   The investigation began in April 1987, when the mother of the
child involved in the first trial said her 3-year-old daughter had
said that ``Teacher Sandy did something to me.''
   Mrs. Fabiano said she hoped dismissal of the charges would
inspire new laws protecting teachers and others who work with
children from unfounded charges of sexual abuse. ``I would never
want to see anyone else go through this,'' she said.

<HEAD>Cardinal Says Going to Lebanon is Priestly Responsibility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor says he will travel to
Lebanon despite the obvious risks because there are ``suffering
people out there who look to the church.''
   ``The chances of having something undesirable happen are real,
but I'm leaving with the expectation of coming back,'' O'Connor
said shortly before leaving the United States Thursday. O'Connor
heads the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New York.
   O'Connor acknowledged that the State Department warned him of
the danger of being killed or taken captive.
   ``I don't think I'd be worth much as a captive,'' O'Connor said,
adding that he appreciated the government's expressions of concern.
   ``But I'm a priest and I have priestly responsibilities,'' he
said.
   O'Connor said the church ``is very fragile there. It could be
obliterated.''
   O'Connor said he was making the journey on a Vatican passport
and visa.
   The visit of about three days will permit O'Connor, in his role
as head of the Catholic Near East Welfare Mission, to visit
clinics, hospitals and orphanages the church operates in Lebanon.

   President Daniel Ortega said he
ordered the expulsion of two U.S. diplomats to teach the U.S.
government to respect Nicaragua's sovereignty.
   Ortega said he acted ``so that the United States understands
that there is a space that it must respect.'' The pair, he charged,
were ``meddling in the country's internal affairs.''
   Ortega spoke Thursday to a group of coffee workers in Matagalpa,
85 miles northeast of the nation's capital.
   The Sandinsta government announced the expulsions Thursday,
saying it believes the diplomats instigated wildcat teachers'
strikes.
   ``This shows the United States government is committed to
disobeying the norms of civilized coexistence and is pledged to
destabilizing governments, such as the one in Nicaragua,'' Foreign
Minister Miguel D'Escoto said Thursday.
   In Washington, the State Department said the charges were
``totally false and without any credible foundation.''
   ``Clearly the government of Nicaragua is embarrassed by the fact
that teachers in Nicaragua are on strike against conditions in that
country,'' press officer Dennis Harter said.
   He suggested the action was to divert attention from the fact
that the teachers' strike is being waged by a traditionally
pro-Sandinista trade union.
   Ortega said Thursday, ``We are conscious that (the teachers) are
badly paid like ther rest of the workers.'' But he added, ``The
aggressive U.S. policy is responsible'' for Nicaragua's current
economic crisis.
   He specifically blamed a U.S. trade embargo and Washington's
support for right-wing Nicaraguan rebels known as the Contras.
   Government spokesman Dionisio Marenco identified the diplomats
ordered expelled as Kathleen Williamson Barmon, U.S. attache for
Central American labor affairs, and economic attache Joel Franklin
Cassman.
   Cassman was given 72 hours to leave and Ms. Barmon 48 hours.
   She is based in Honduras but had been in Nicaragua for two days,
Marenco said. Cassman arrived in Nicaragua last week with six other
U.S. officials replacing seven American diplomats expelled last
year.
   Marenco said the two ``went around distributing money and
exhorting the teachers to strike.''

   Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale said
today he will not enter the 1990 race for a U.S. Senate seat in
Minnesota and will not seek any other elective office in the future.
   ``I believe it's time for other candidates to step forward,''
said Mondale, a former senator who was the Democratic Party's
presidential nominee in 1984. ``It was a very difficult choice for
us.''
   Mondale, 61, said he has enjoyed his life out of political
office and has seen too many colleagues remain in the Senate for
too long. He was considering running against incumbent Rudy
Boschwitz, a Republican.
   ``I'm at peace with myself,'' Mondale said. ``We took a lot of
time making this decision and it's a basic one. It's a lot easier
deciding when to get into politics as opposed to when to leave.''
   A poll commissioned by Mondale indicated that the former vice
president could defeat Boschwitz in the 1990 race. The poll,
released by Mondale's son, Ted Mondale, shows Mondale leading
Boschwitz 51 percent to 40 percent, with 8 percent undecided.
   ``Fritz Mondale clearly would have been the toughest competitor
I could have had,'' Boschwitz told a news conference in St. Paul.
``I certainly do have a sense of relief that he will not be the
competitor.''
   Mondale, a protege of the late Hubert H. Humphrey, generally had
been considered the most formidable candidate Democrats could field
against Boschwitz, a two-term senator. Mondale's announcement was
expected to result in an immediate scramble among Minnesota
Democrats for the 1990 Senate endorsement.
   The only announced challenger to Boschwitz is Democratic
National Committee member Paul Wellstone, a political science
professor at Carleton College and a leader of the Rev. Jesse
Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign in Minnesota.
   Boschwitz, 58, was elected to the Senate in 1978.
   Mondale represented Minnesota in the Senate from 1965 until
1976, when he left to be Jimmy Carter's vice president. He ran
unsuccessfully for president against Ronald Reagan in 1984.
   Speculation that he planned to run again began in June 1987,
when Mondale moved from Washington, D.C., back to Minnesota to
practice law with a Minneapolis firm.
   Mondale said today he was certain two years ago that he would
``not be tempted by yet another race for political office.'' But he
said he considered running against Boschwitz because he loved
public life and the U.S. Senate and believed he would have a strong
chance of winning.
   Mondale said he decided two days ago, after seeking advice from
numerous friends and associates, to end his political career.
   He and his wife, Joan, spent more than 30 years in the
``political pressure cooker,'' Mondale said.
   ``For the first time in our lives, we have time to enjoy private
life, to be with our family and friends and time to pursue our
other interests that we could never do before,'' he said.
   ``I am finding that I can be heard on public matters while
remaining in private life.''
   Mondale said those from whom he sought counsel were nearly
unanimous in urging him to run, but nearly all of them also said
they would understand if he didn't.

   A summit of Arab leaders today
dropped a demand that Syria withdraw its troops from Beirut after
encountering fierce opposition from the Syrians, conference
officials said.
   Instead, the conference called for a revision of Lebanon's
Constitution and left as a ``gentleman's agreement'' the withdrawal
of Syrian soldiers from the capital, said Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz.
   The revised constitution would involve political reforms that
could be considered the basis for national reconciliation in
Lebanon, split by 14 years of civil war.
   Lebanese Moslems, now a majority in the country, claim the
constitution reserves too much power for Christians, who were
dominant when Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943.
   The withdrawal provision had been written into a resolution
adopted early today, but it was deleted when leaders of the
22-member Arab League met to draft the final communique from their
four-day summit.
   Syria's President Hafez Assad argued bitterly over the Lebanon
issue with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Iraq is the main
backer of the Christian forces and wanted a full Syrian withdrawal
from Lebanon.
   Aziz told reporters the resolution ``fell short of what must be
done on this important issue. If it works, we shall be pleased, but
if it doesn't, we shall convene again here and deal with the whole
matter more satisfactorily, and get a full mandate to take all the
necessary measures.''
   Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate, and they have joined forces with Moslem
militias fighting the mainly Christian troops of Army Gen. Michel
Aoun.
   The summit entered its final hours amid news reports Syria had
reinforced its troops in Lebanon. Jerusalem's Yediot Ahronot said
an additional 40 Syrian tanks were moved into Lebanon, along with
an undetermined number of troops.
   An early draft of the summit's resolution called for a
committee, led by Morocco's King Hassan II, to oversee the
withdrawal of Syrian forces from Beirut within three months.
   Last-minute Syrian stalling tactics forced the removal of that
provision from the resolution, said conference sources speaking on
condition they not be named.
   Aziz made it clear that Iraq considered the withdrawal to be
implicit and mandatory, and sources said the resolution still could
be changed before this afternoon's closing plenary meeting.
   The earlier version also called for elections within three
months to choose a government of ``national unity'' in Lebanon. The
revision called for the committee led by Hassan to oversee revision
of Lebanon's Constitution within six months. This would presumably
include elections.
   The summit was extended a day as delegates sought agreement on
Lebanon, where Arab League-sponsored cease-fires have failed to
stop fighting between Christians and the Syrian-backed Moslems.
   More than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 wounded
since Christian and Moslem forces began shelling each other's
positions March 8 in the latest round of fighting.
   The summit saw some spectacular reconciliations, particularly
between Libya's leader, Moammar Gadhafi, and Egypt's leader, Hosni
Mubarak, at his first Arab summit in 10 years. One session had to
be delayed as Mubarak and Gadhafi concluded a 3{-hour reunion
meeting.
   The summit convened Tuesday to welcome Egypt back to the Arab
fold after a 10-year ostracism for making peace with Israel.

<TEXT>
   Disgraced Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita will stay
in office longer than expected because the governing party has been
unable to find a successor, party officials said today.
   Liberal Democratic Party officials also said Takeshita accepted
a request from party executives to help in the search, which has
been stalled since the most likely candidate rejected the post.
   Although he originally was scheduled to step down at the end of
this month, Takeshita has agreed to remain in office until the
party selects a new prime minister.
   Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said Takeshita
will meet party Secretary-General Shintaro Abe on Saturday to
discuss possible choices.
   Takeshita announced April 25 that he would leave office when the
fiscal 1989 budget cleared parliament to take responsibility for a
bribery scandal and consequent loss of confidence in his party.
   The budget bill becomes law Sunday, but no candidates have
emerged to replace Takeshita.
   The Liberal Democrats' search for a new leader suffered a major
setback May 13 when Masayoshi Ito, a reform-minded party veteran,
refused to take the job. He cited his age of 75, failing health and
a disagreement with party leaders over political reform measures.
   A new leader is needed to clean up the party's scandal-tainted
image and salvage its plunging popularity before an election for
half the seats in parliament's upper house, expected in June.
   The party is facing the worst crisis in its 34-year history
because of a corruption and influence-peddling scandal named after
Recruit. Co, an information and publishing congolemerate accused of
selling politicians shares at low prices in exchange for favors.
   The scandal forced Takeshita's resignation and led to indictment
of a former Cabinet minister and senior bureaucrats. It also has
damaged the political futures of dozens of senior politicians,
including former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   News reports speculate that two of the most likely prospects to
replace Takeshita are former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, 84, and
former lower house Speaker Michita Sakata, 72.

<HEAD>Early Cholesterol Tests Can Help Predict Future Readings, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cholesterol tests in adults as young as 20 can be
used to predict who is apt to have dangerously high cholesterol
later in life, federal researchers said.
   Such tests could enable people to change their diet or begin
exercise programs before serum cholesterol levels get too high,
said a study issued Thursday by the Atlanta-based Centers for
Disease Control.
   High cholesterol is a major factor in heart disease.
   The researchers studied statistics on how cholesterol levels
change over time, and developed a formula for predicting what
cholesterol level a person with a given reading at a given age
would have years later _ assuming they make no changes in their
lifestyle. The data can be used to predict the serum cholesterol
levels of adults age 20 to 57, the study found.
   For example, a 30-year-old woman with a cholesterol level of 155
can expect a level of 188 by age 50 and the borderline high level
of 200 at age 56 if no exercise or diet improvements are made.
   A count of above 240 is considered high.
   Researchers found that a man's cholesterol count increases by
about two points a year from ages 20 to 30 and one point a year
from age 30 to 60, or an increase of 50 points over the 40 years,
the report said.
   A woman's cholesterol level, on the other hand, normally
increases by about 1{ points a year from age 20 to 40 and two
points a year from age 40 to 60 or 70 points over the 40-year span.

   China's hard-line leaders stripped Communist
Party chief Zhao Ziyang of his post and placed him under house
arrest in a purge of officials who supported demands for political
reforms, sources said today.
   Zhao lost power in a bitter fight with Premier Li Peng, Chinese
and diplomatic sources said. Li last week ordered a crackdown on
students occupying Tiananmen Square to press demands for a freer
society and cleaner government. Soldiers are deployed on the
outskirts of Beijing, but tens of thousands of citizens have
prevented them from entering the city by surrounding the convoys
and setting up barricades. The soldiers have retreated to nearby
barracks.
   The student occupation of Tiananmen entered its 14th day today.
An overnight rock concert by some students contributed to a festive
atmosphere.
   According to sources, officials who have worked under Zhao to
chart political and economic reforms will face disciplinary action,
and some will lose their jobs. Those reported in trouble include
the party's propaganda chief, Hu Qili, and Vice Premier Tian Jiyun.
   The reports could not be officially confirmed.
   Although the number of students in Tiananmen Square has dwindled
to 20,000, leaders said those remaining were committed to
continuing their occupation.
   ``It's going to get more complex. We cannot ascertain what the
leaders intentions are, but we will not leave the square,'' said a
student leader from Qinhua University who gave only his last name,
Xin.
   Zhao has been a leading proponent of market-oriented economic
reforms championed by 84-year-old senior leader Deng Xiaoping, but
the two differ over political change. Zhao has expressed sympathy
with the student protesters, whose campaign evolved into a
nationwide movement involving millions of people.
   President Yang Shangkun, a Deng ally, told top officials
Thursday Zhao's actions ``had a very bad effect'' on the nation, a
government source said.
   Chinese and diplomatic sources said Zhao was under house arrest.
A document circulated today to county- and district-level party
officials said Zhao was no longer head of the party, according to a
diplomat who has proved reliable in the past. No successor was
named in the document.
   Sources said conservatives accused Zhao of heading an anti-party
clique, splitting the party, instigating disturbances, revealing
party secrets, corruption and taking credit for Deng's achievements
during the past decade of economic reform.
   Two sources said National People's Congress Chairman Wan Li was
under detention in Shanghai, and one source said a member of the
party's decision- making Politburo was also under house arrest.
   Leaders of the tens of thousands of students still in Tiananmen
Square said they had not changed their resolution to stay, despite
the latest reports.
   ``It's going to get more complex. We cannot ascertain what the
leaders' intentions are, but we will not leave the square,'' said a
student from Qinhua University who gave only his last name, Xin.
   The reports were not the first time top leaders were said to be
in trouble during the power struggle, but the official media have
indicated the conservatives are winning the battle for power.
   The official People's Daily newspaper reported today that all
seven of the nation's military districts were backing Li's martial
law decree.
   State-run newspapers on Thursday prominently displayed a letter
from military commanders supporting the crackdown.
   Li appeared on nationwide television Thursday for the first time
in six days and defended martial law.
   Zhao has not appeared in public since May 19, although a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said Thursday that Zhao retained his post.
   President Yang _ speaking to Politburo members, retired
revolutionary leaders and Beijing delegates of the national
legislature _ said troops surrounding Beijing eventually would
assume control of the city's streets, the Chinese source said.
   The 81-year-old president said the army would not move
immediately ``in order not to worsen the situation,'' according to
the source.
   Two sources said Wan Li was under detention in Shanghai after
being prevented from returning to Beijing on Thursday. The official
Chinese press said he was staying in Shanghai for ``medical
treatment.''
   Wan rushed back to China after cutting short a trip to the
United States, where he praised the students as leading a patriotic
movement.
   The fate of Hu Qili, one of five members on the Politburo
Standing Committee _ the pinnacle of party power _ was less clear.
He recently was reported to have backed Zhao.
   One source said Hu, who has been in charge of propaganda, was
under house arrest. The other members of the standing committee are
Li, Zhao, Yao Yilin and Qiao Shi.
   Yang, a former general, also indicated that Communist Party
members who have participated in the demonstrations will be
punished. Among the huge crowds protesting with the students have
been party members from state-run media, research institutes,
government ministries and factories.
   Hong Kong newspapers reported today that a researcher for
China's official Xinhua News Agency who urged Li to resign had gone
into hiding after escaping a kidnap attempt. The newspapers quoted
Xu Haining as saying his apartment was ransacked Tuesday and he
``barely escaped the kidnap.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush began a four-nation European trip
today, declaring the United States wants a ``stronger and more
united Europe'' as he headed to a NATO summit where an arms-control
dispute threatens allied unity.
   With the North Atlantic Treaty Organization embroiled in a major
dispute about nuclear weapons policy, The Washington Times reported
that Bush planned to use the summit as the stage for announcing a
reduction of up to 10 percent in U.S. troop strength in Europe,
``as many as 34,000 troops.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters aboard Air
Force One en route to Rome: ``Any ideas in this area would be one
the president would want to discuss with the allies, he would raise
with his partners at this session before he discusses anything
publicly ... I am not confirming or denying any decisions.''
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., told CBS News in Washington that a 10 percent
reduction ``is the probable amount of reduction that would occur if
the Soviet Union accepted the NATO proposal on conventional arms
control which is now tabled.''
   A senior NATO official, asked by reporters in Brussels about the
report, said ``our delegations here on the spot have not been
apprised of this.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   West German government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling said in
Bonn, ``We have no official word of such a decision.'' Some 250,000
U.S. troops are stationed in West Germany.
   In his departure remarks, Bush provided no hint of a significant
American counter to recent Soviet arms proposals. He said, ``The
importance of the alliance and its democratic underpinnings is the
message I now take to Europe.''
   Bush, upon arriving at the first stop of his trip in Rome noted
that, ``Since ancient times, the saying goes, ``All roads lead to
Rome'' and it's still true. It is fitting that here I begin my
first trip to Europe as president of the United States.''
   Bush praised U.S.-Italy ties of friendship and said ``The United
States welcomes a stronger and more united Europe.'' He said he
plans to be ``actively engaged in Eastern Europe, promoting
measures to encourage political and economic liberlization in
Poland.''
   In his departure remarks at Andrews Air Force Base outside
Washington, the president said, ``NATO has been a success by any
measure but success breeds its own challenges. Today, dramatic
changes are taking place in Europe, East and West. For us, those
changes bring new challenges and unparalleled opportunities.''
   Bush expressed hopes to see a Europe ``that is truly free,
united and at peace'' and repeated his desire to move beyond the
Cold War policy of containment ``to integrate the Soviet Union into
the community of nations.''
   Bush added: ``We welcome the political and economic
liberalization that has taken place so far in the Soviet Union and
in some countries of Eastern Europe. We watch hoping that more
changes will follow.''
   In Rome, the president planned a two-night stay and talks with
Pope John Paul II as well as with Italian leaders.
   Manfred Woerner, who is NATO's chief executive, said failure to
settle a dispute over nuclear weapons would be ``a rather
unfortunate situation but it would not be a crisis or a
catastrophe.''
   Amid growing doubts in Washington that a settlement was near,
Woerner said in Brussels he would like the allies to reach an
agreement ``and avoid the impression of being split in an important
matter.''
   Setting the stage for the NATO meeting, Bush will deliver a
speech Sunday at an American cemetery in Nettuno, on Italy's
seacoast 39 miles south of the capital. Later Sunday, the president
will arrive in Brussels where leaders of the 16-nation alliance
will begin two days of formal talks on Monday. From Brussels, Bush
will go to West Germany and Britain.
   The summit, called to mark NATO's 40th anniversary and its
success in keeping the peace in Europe, was thrown off track in
advance by a dispute over short-range nuclear missiles in central
Europe.
   The chief players in the argument are West Germany, which is
demanding East-West negotiations soon to curb the missiles, and the
United States and Britain, which oppose such talks as long as the
Soviet Union maintains a major advantage in ground troops, tanks
and other conventional weapons.
   The missiles, with a range of less than 300 miles, are largely
deployed in West Germany and would be used there in the case of war.
   The Bonn-Washington dispute is aggravated by a tide of
disarmament sentiment in West Germany, fanned by Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promises to reduce conventional and nuclear
forces.
   On the eve of his departure, Bush received a message from West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the latest in a series of proposals
and counterproposals. However, the White House said the two sides
remained at an impasse.
   ``Our attitude from the beginning has been that we would like to
reach an agreement on this before the summit, but if not, we'll
discuss it there,'' said Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater.
``If it's not resolved there, we'll discuss it in follow-on
consultations.''
   Emphasizing that the dispute will not shake the foundations of
NATO, Fitzwater said, ``We don't believe it will overwhelm or
dominate the summit and it should not and will not be allowed to.''
   In Brussels, Woerner said, ``This alliance has lived with
differences of opinion all through its very successful lifetime,
and if this question is not solved today it will be solved
tomorrow.''
   The West German government also is resisting a joint
U.S.-British effort to more than triple the range of Lance missiles
to just below 300 miles. However, a decision on modernizing the
weapons has been put off until 1992.
   Bush's trip, his first to Europe as president, is seen as an
important step as he tries to establish himself as a world
statesman and attempts to counter Gorbachev's success in projecting
himself as a peacemaker.
   ``It's nothing new that a new president faces a test from
Moscow,'' said Burton Pines, senior vice president and director of
research at the Heritage Foundation. ``The first test of Bush is
not coming from Moscow. It's Bonn which is testing the new
president.''

   Maverick Boris N. Yeltsin and several prominent
reformers in the new congress were nominated today for a smaller,
full-time legislature, but some charged that senior officials
rigged the nominee list to stay in power.
   Lithuania threatened to boycott the elections to the new
legislature if delegates from other republics are allowed to vote
on the Lithuanian slate.
   The Lithuanians and other Baltic reformers want to protect their
small reform slates from being lost in an all-congress vote.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called the boycott threat ``a crisis
situation.''
   The moves came during the second day of debate in the
2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, the first competitively
elected national assembly and the latest step in the Soviet
experiment with democratic reform.
   Only one member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo appeared
on a congressional list of nominees for the smaller law-making
body, the Supreme Soviet, assuring an overhaul of its traditional
makeup.
   Procedural bickering today mirrored the disputes that slowed the
first day of activity in the congress, which was elected this
spring in the first nationwide multicandidate balloting in 70 years.
   A list of 573 members of congress selected by their home regions
was prepared for 542 seats in the Supreme Soviet, giving deputies
few choices but setting up tough races for lawmakers from Moscow,
home to many of the reformers.
   ``The party apparatus is once again asking us to elect the
Supreme Soviet according to the old system,'' complained deputy
Vladimir Shevlyuga of Rostov.
   Vladimir Zolotukhin of Tashkent said top party and government
officials in Uzbekistan had themselves nominated without consulting
other deputies from the republic.
   Reformers lost an attempt to force top party officials to choose
between their party jobs and serving in the Supreme Soviet, as a
way of easing the grip of the party bureaucracy on the country's
legislature.
   The congress adopted a measure calling for Supreme Soviet
members ``as a rule'' to be freed from other jobs to concentrate on
lawmaking _ far short of the outright ban sought by delegates.
   Meanwhile, the Lithuanian delegation announced through deputy
Vytautas Landsbergis it would boycott planned elections to the
Supreme Soviet if deputies from other republics are allowed to vote
on the Lithuanian slate.
   The congress is trying to decide whether only republics and
specific regions should be allowed to select their members in the
Supreme Soviet, or whether lists of candidates from each area
should be presented to the entire congress to be narrowed down.
   The Lithuanians, who have been pressing for more autonomy from
Moscow, are seeking to have their slate elected intact to the
congress, without delegates from other regions tampering with it.
   The boycott threat drew criticism from Moscow delegates, causing
a rift between two leading groups of reformers.
   Roy Medvedev, a Moscow historian, appealed to the Lithuanians to
reconsider. ``I ask the comrades from Lithuania ... not to break
the huge amount of work done in our society to democratize it,'' he
said.
   Moscow deputies, who are generally better known nationally,
insisted on presenting a slate of 55 candidates for the 29 seats
allocated to them to underline the principle of contested elections.
   On Thursday, the congress elected Gorbachev to a five-year term.
Gorbachev ran unopposed.
   He was first elected president by the Supreme Soviet on Oct. 1,
1988, replacing Andrei Gromyko in what was then a largely a
ceremonial post.
   Yeltsin refused to run against Gorbachev but kept alive the
possibility he would run for vice president. He told reporters he
did not intend to withdraw from any more races.
   Some members of the congress plunged into debate over procedural
issues, while many others appeared bored by the slow pace of the
televised session.
   Fedor Burlatsky, a political commentator and head of the
government's human rights commission, said the congress was trying
to work out ``not only differences of opinion but differing
interests, of different nationalities and different layers of
society.''
   Gorbachev rejected calls to place microphones throughout the
huge hall to permit speakers to have the floor without walking to
the well in the center of the auditorium. ``Let's not turn this
into a bazaar,'' he said.
   While Yeltsin's name appeared on the list of candidates for the
Supreme Soviet, his election was not assured.
   He was among 12 deputies nominated by a caucus of the Russian
federation, the country's largest constituent republic, for their
11 seats. It was also possible nominations would come from the
floor.
   Yeltsin, once a rising star among Gorbachev's key aides, was
fired for criticizing the slow pace of reform, then staged a
dramatic comeback by winning a landslide victory to the congress.
   Among the Moscow nominees were some of the nation's best-known
progressives, including Medvedev, economist Gavril Popov and
agriculture reform advocate Yuri Chernichenko.
   Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, chairman of the Russian federation's
Council of Ministers, was the only member of the Communist Party's
ruling Politburo on the list, indicating the Supreme Soviet will be
led by a new group of leaders.
   In the past, the body paralleled the leadership of the Communist
Party, making it a virtual rubber-stamp for the Kremlin leadership.

   Zhao Ziyang, the man who represents China's new,
progressive leadership, apparently has been purged by an old guard
intent on retaining its lock on power and crushing a student
movement for democracy.
   Several sources said today that Zhao, 69, had lost his post as
general secretary of the 47 million-member Communist Party. That
position had made him the most powerful man in China after senior
leader Deng Xiaoping.
   The sources said Zhao has lost a power struggle with the more
conservative Premier Li Peng. They said he was under house arrest
today and that the party had accused him of fueling student unrest
with a conciliatory stance.
   Although Deng is Zhao's mentor in economic reforms, the two
differ sharply on political reform and Zhao's sympathy for the
students apparently was unacceptable.
   If Zhao's fall is permanent, he would be the second general
secretary in two years to fall from Deng's good graces and be
sacked for being too sympathetic to pro-democracy student
demonstrators.
   In January 1987, Hu Yaobang was forced to resign as general
secretary after being accused of being soft on students seeking a
freer China. It was Hu's death on April 15 that sparked the far
larger student movement of today.
   Zhao ended a seven-year term as premier when he was named head
of the party in November 1987. At the same time he was appointed
first vice chairman of the Central Military Commission _ Deng is
chairman _ giving him the needed authority with the military to
cement his claim as Deng's successor.
   But Zhao became the target of criticism in mid-1988 when the
government, hit by an inflation rate of more than 30 percent and
panic buying, began worrying that it had lost control of the
economy.
   Conservatives such as Premier Li blamed the rapid pace of
market-oriented reforms associated with Zhao, and imposed a
two-year austerity program and freeze on new reforms.
   Zhao's position became more tenuous this spring with the renewed
student unrest.
   While tens of thousands of students occupied Tiananmen Square
earlier this month, Zhao told Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
that political and economic reform should proceed at an equal pace
and that Chinese should enjoy ``genuine democracy'' under the
Communist Party.
   He later expressed sympathy for the student demands for
democratic reforms and advocated negotiations with the protesters
to end the crisis.
   Deng has permitted only token political liberalization, and he
reportedly gave the orders for declaring martial law in Beijing.
   Zhao has been a role model for the new-style Chinese leader.
Suave and articulate, he is at ease with the leaders of the
socialist and Western worlds. He wears immaculately tailored
Western suits, and regularly plays golf, a sport once condemned in
China as a bourgeois luxury.
   Zhao was born in October 1919 to a landowning family in central
China's Henan province. He joined the Communist Party in 1938 and
headed the party committee in his native county for most of the
1937-45 China-Japan war.
   Unlike the previous generation of party leaders, he did not take
part in the 1934-35 Long March, the 7,700-mile trek to the
northwest to escape the Nationalist government troops in eastern
China.
   After the Communist victory in 1949, Zhao spent most of his
career in regional government and party posts. He was purged during
the 1966-76 far-leftist Cultural Revolution, as was Deng, but was
rehabilitated as early as 1971.
   He gained national prominence as party secretary and governor of
Deng's home province, Sichuan, where he carried out Deng's policies
of dismantling communes and allowing private plots and bonuses for
extra work.
   Zhao was named party secretary in October at a conference in
which his keynote speech emphasized increasing production over
ideological issues. He also announced Deng's theory that China was
in a ``primary stage'' of socialism, during which time private
ownership of businesses was permissible.

<HEAD>Ultralight Pilots Say They Spirited Friend From East Germany</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two ultralight planes landed in front of the
Reichstag building in West Berlin early today, and two men
reportedly claimed they flew a friend to freedom in a daring escape
from East Germany,
   Police said they were mystified by the landings and had no
independent confirmation of the reported escape.
   The planes were abandoned after landing in front of the
Reichstag building, next to the Berlin Wall, at about 5 a.m.,
police said. The pilots were not seen, and police later towed the
aircraft away.
   Police first said they doubted the planes were used for an
escape but later said they were not ruling out such a possibility.
   An anonymous caller telephoned several radio stations to claim
he flew his relatives out of East Germany to West Berlin.
   Rainer Hildebrandt, head of a private organizaton that monitors
escapes from East Germany, said two men came to his office and
claimed they were the pilots. He said the two men told him they
flew into East Germany, picked up a friend and flew back to West
Berlin.
   Hildebrandt said he could not confirm the claim. It was not
immediately clear why the men would have needed to planes to pick
up their friend.
   The men told Hildebrandt they had recorded the flight on film
and wanted to sell it, Hildebrandt said. They refused to appear
before reporters, Hildebrandt said in a telephone interview.
   He said the men were between 30 and 40 years of age but did not
identify themselves. They said they were former East German
citizens who have been living in the West, he said.
   Hildebrandt heads Working Group August 13, a private
organization that monitors escapes and human rights in East Germany.
   Witnesses reported the propeller-driven aircraft flew parallel
to the Berlin at an alititude of about 165 feet, police said.
   Police said the olive-green planes were marked with red stars
pasted onto the wings with yellow tape. This could have been a ruse
designed to fool East German border guards, police said.
   Police said the abandoned ultralights appeared to be the same as
two aircraft transported to West Berlin from West Germany four
weeks ago.
   The planes were transported in parts and authorities had given
permission for the aircraft to be assembled but not flown, police
said.

   Police today stopped a 41-year-old
man from hijacking a Czechoslovak passenger plane as it flew from
Prague to the nearby town of Karlovy Vary, the official CTK news
agency.
   The man, identified as Bohuslav Behula, was ``rendered harmless
by the police during the attempt,'' the agency said.
   That is a phrase security forces often use when they kill a
dangerous criminal, but it was not possible to determine whether
Behula was slain.
   Czechoslovak planes normally have one or more security agents
aboard, but the report did not say how Behula was subdued.
   None of the 24 passengers or crew of the Soviet-made JAK 4O
plane was injured, CTK said. The plane landed in Karlovy Vary, 70
miles west of Prague.

<HEAD>Judges Reject Journalists' Appeal of Broadcast Banp ^Eds: MccGwire

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court today upheld the government's ban on
broadcast interviews with members of extremist groups in Northern
Ireland. Lawyers for journalists said they may appeal.
   Six broadcast journalists said the ban on interviews with groups
such as the Irish Republican Army and the Ulster Freedom Fighters
was unlawful, an unjustifiable interference with freedom of
expression, and a violation of the European Convention on Human
Rights.
   But three High Court judges ruled that Home Secretary Douglas
Hurd acted reasonably and lawfully, and with the majority approval
of Parliament, in imposing the ban in October.
   Hurd's order prohibits the British Broadcasting Corp. and the
Independent Broadcasting Authority, which oversees commercial TV,
from broadcasting words spoken by Northern Ireland extremists. The
extremists' actions, objectives and views can be reported.
   The rule applies to the IRA and its legal political wing Sinn
Fein, which are fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland,
as well as the Ulster Freedom Fighters, an outlawed Protestant
extremist group that wants the province to remain British.
   Lord Justice Tasker Watkins, announcing the decision, said the
ban did not prevent either the BBC or commercial television from
reporting events in Northern Ireland ``with due impartiality.''
   He said the reasonableness of Hurd's ban was reflected in the
parliamentary debates in which many lawmakers said the restrictions
were justified by the need to fight terrorism in Northern Ireland.
   Jacob Ecclestone, deputy general secretary of the National Union
of Journalists, said an appeal was likely all the way to the House
of Lords, Britain's highest court.
   Broadcaster Scarlett MccGwire, one of the plaintiffs, called the
ruling ``a blow to the British public.''
   ``The case is not just about journalists not being able to
report Northern Ireland properly. It is about people not being able
to understand what is happening there because it is not reported
properly,'' she said.
   The plaintiffs claimed the restrictions were unjustified,
especially since the amount of broadcasting time given in the past
to interviews with members of proscribed organizations had been
``trifling'' and had not shown those interviewed in a good light.
   Watkins said the question for the court was not whether Hurd's
decision was politically wise or unwise but simply whether it was
lawful.

   Battle lines have been drawn in the perjury trial
of former Rep. Pat Swindall, with prosecutors saying he negotiated
to borrow drug money and lied about it and Swindall's lawyers
saying he was duped.
   Swindall is accused of lying to a federal grand jury about his
dealings with an Internal Revenue Service undercover agent, Mike
Mullaney, and a Swindall associate, Charles LeChasney, later
convicted of money laundering.
   Prosecutors say Swindall negotiated to use LeChasney as a
middleman in an attempt to borrow $850,000 for construction of his
luxury home from a money broker representing drug interests _
actually the undercover agent.
   Mullaney, the first witness for the prosecution, testified today
that at his first meeting with Swindall in August 1987, the
congressman ``brought up the possibility'' of having LeChasney
create ``some sort of corporation ... and he would basically get
his money from Charles LeChasney's company.''
   Prosecutors played a videotape for the jury of that meeting, but
jurors complained they couldn't hear the soundtrack properly. A
recess was called while court officials worked on the problem.
   On Thursday, when he began his testimony, Mullaney had said that
LeChasney told him that Swindall ``didn't care where the money came
from.''
   He said he also was interested in meeting Swindall to
investigate whether Swindall's plans to sell a $1 million note at a
discount for cash ``would lead to an evasion of his income taxes''
and violations of currency laws.
   In opening statements Thursday, Swindall's attorney, Richard
Hendrix, told the jury that Swindall and the government were duped
by ``Charles LeChasney, the master manipulator.''
   Hendrix described LeChasney as ``a man with a severe mental
disorder ... a sociopath,'' and said LeChasney repeatedly fooled
Swindall into thinking the money was legitimate, and fooled the
government into thinking that Swindall was a tax-evading ``crook.''
   Hendrix told the jury that Swindall never agreed to the deal and
that he continued to shop for and ultimately got other financing
for his home.
   After Swindall did his best to recall for the grand jury in
February 1988 events of five months earlier, Hendrix said, the
former congressman was indicted anyway by a government
``predisposed to believe he's a crook.''
   Swindall was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 counts of lying to a federal
grand jury, each of which carries a penalty of 10 months to five
years in prison.
   The two-term Republican congressman lost his 4th District seat
in Atlanta's eastern suburbs to Democrat Ben Jones, a onetime actor
in television's ``Dukes of Hazzard,'' in November. The campaign was
one of the most bitter House races in the country and one of only a
handful that ended up in the defeat of an incumbent congressman.
   Briefs unsealed Thursday showed prosecutors have sought to
introduce tapes of LeChasney telling the undercover agent that
Swindall didn't want to know details about the money scheme because
the congressman said he wanted to be sure he could pass a
lie-detector test if necessary.
   The prosecutors said the tapes would show Swindall planned to
lie to the grand jury.
   But defense attorneys contended that if the tapes were admitted
as evidence, they should be allowed to submit evidence that
Swindall passed a lie detector test in which he was asked if he had
lied to the grand jury. Such evidence previously has been ruled
inadmissible in most cases.

   The five teen-agers charged with
sexually assaulting a mentally retarded girl with a toy baseball
bat and a broom handle have been suspended from school for 10 days.
   ``They were not suspended because of the alleged acts, but
because of the disruption their presence in the school would have
on the educational program,'' said Glen Ridge Superintendent of
Schools Rose McCaffrey.
   The five Glen Ridge High School students were arrested Wednesday
and charged with sexually assaulting the girl at the home of two of
the boys, co-captains of the football team, in this Newark suburb.
   Eight other male teens, including the son of a Glen Ridge police
lieutenant, cheered the attack on the 17-year-old girl without
intervening, investigators said. The eight are considered witnesses
and have not been charged.
   At the school's annual ``spring day'' Thursday, the picnics and
games were marred by fights, vandalism and the discovery of
graffiti on walls inside the school building, students said.
   One student shook his head as he removed a rock and shards of
glass from the back seat of his car. Some passers-by in cars
shouted ``rapists'' as they drove past the school.
   Damian DeVito, a 17-year-old junior, defended the accused teens,
two of whom are his football teammates. He said has known the
victim since elementary school and said he believed she willingly
participated in the March 1 incident.
   ``I know them well enough to know they wouldn't do anything
against somebody's will,'' DeVito told reporters. ``These kids are
really not bad kids at all.''
   Karl Greiner, a spokesman for the Association for Retarded
Citizens-New Jersey, called the attack demeaning.
   ``I suppose that she was treated like an object ... a
dehumanizing affair at best, with spectators cheering on,'' Greiner
said. ``It's difficult enough to live your life with a handicap.
It's especially difficult to be treated in a dehumanizing way.''
   A 17-year-old football teammate of some of those charged says he
was asked to videotape them having sex with the victim the day
after the assault, the New York Post reported today.
   Charles Figueroa said he refused to make the tape and eventually
informed authorities about the attack, the newspaper said. There
was no answer this morning at a telephone listing for Figueroa.
   Figueroa's comments are suspect because he ``likes to
fantasize,'' McCaffrey said. She said the student undergoes
counseling in a school resource room.

   Teachers returned to classrooms today with
higher salaries and more authority in the schools after approving a
three-year contract to end a bitter strike in the 594,000-pupil
district.
   Teachers, students and administrators expressed joy and relief
today at the return to regular classes.
   ``I feel just fine because everything is back to normal now,''
said smiling 10th-grader Brenda Montoya as she headed to class at
Belmont High. ``We have our teachers back and now we can get back
to our studies.''
   Principal Marta Lavat Vin told students gathered for an assembly
that it was time for them to get back to their studies.
   ``I said I didn't want to see anyone leaving school without
their books today, I told them if they were heading out of the
building and didn't have their books, they'd better have a good
excuse.''
   The teachers approved a pact Thursday that increases pay by 24
percent over three years, gives them greater curricula control, and
reduces outside classroom duties such as yard supervision.
   ``Things in the Los Angeles Unified School District, as far as
teachers are concerned, have changed for all time,'' proclaimed
United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson before the
agremeement was approved by the union's members in a voice vote at
the Sports Arena.
   Teachers lost on the issue of recovering pay that had been
docked because of job actions that preceded their May 15 walkout.
Many teachers had refused to patrol school yards or work on grading
after school.
   Board members also approved the pact, reached by negotiators at
1 a.m. Thursday.
   ``I look forward to healing, not only on the board but in the
district as a whole,'' said board President Roberta Weintraub.
   One board member, Rita Walters, criticized the $600 million
salary plan as a drain on other parts of the budget.
   ``There is money being taken away from the children by the
district, from other workers in our district in order to support
the teacher raise. I think that's unconscionable,'' she said.
   The teachers carved out a site-management program under which
they share power with parents and administrators in overseeing
curriculum and discipline.
   The union represents 22,000 of the Los Angeles Unified School
District's 32,000 teachers, counselors and librarians.
   Salaries under a contract that expired in July 1988 range
between $23,440 and $43,319 a year, depending on experience and
education. The pact raises salaries in the first year to between
$25,316 and $46,594 and at the end of three years to between
$29,529 and $53,938.
   Teachers will receive a retroactive pay raise for the past
school year, during which they worked without a contract.
   The district, the second largest in the nation after New York,
brought in substitutes when teachers walked out. But attendance
plummeted and classes became mostly baby-sitting sessions.

today searched the offices of several leftist unions, human rights
groups and farming cooperatives after the heaviest combat in the
capital in years.
   The U.S.-backed government and armed forces consider the leftist
organizations fronts for Marxist-led guerrillas waging a 9-year-old
revolutionary war.
   Troops from the 1st army brigade, the National Police and the
Treasury Police surrounded the headquarters of the labor
organizations UNTS, Fenastras and FUS. The offices of COACES, a
group representing cooperative farming enterprises, CRIPDES, a
refugees organization, and the non-governmental human rights
commission also were surrounded and searched.
   Troops and police had searched at least three of the
organizations by mid-morning, but there was no immediate word on
whether arrests were made or what was found inside.
   The UNTS labor organization reported in paid radio announcements
that two members of its directorate were arrested.
   Security forces prevented journalists and other interested
parties from approaching the buildings. No one was allowed to enter
or leave the buildings.
   The searches came several hours after leftist guerrillas
attacked parts of the capital a week before a rightist party takes
power. Authorities said six guerrillas were killed Thursday night.
Five members of the National Police, one army soldier and three
civilians were wounded, officials said.
   Col. Orlando Zepeda, commander of the capital-based 1st army
brigade, told journalists the leftist groups harbored guerrillas
who took part in an attack on his brigade Thursday evening.
   Combat raged through much of northern San Salvador, near the
brigade headquarters and three other police and military posts.
   Rebels of the Faribundo Marti National Liberation Frontr dubbed
the offensive ``All Against Arena. We're going to win.''
   Arena is the Spanish acronym of for Republican Nationalist
Alliance, the rightist party that is to take power June 1.
   The guerrillas have pledged ``to make the country ungovernable''
by stepping up attacks in the days leading up to the inauguration
of President-elect Alfredo Cristiani, who is to take office from
centrist Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat.
   Col. Zepeda said about 30 insurgents took part in the attack
Thursday evening, including four men aboard a jeep who fired
U.S.-made M-79 grenades and Soviet-made RPG-18 rocket-propelled
grenades at the brigade headquarters.
   At least six projectiles landed inside the base perimeter and
caused property damage but no casualties, Zepeda said.
   ``We knew the level of violence had to increase. We're ready to
repel anything they try to do,'' he told reporters at brigade
headquarters.
   Thursday's fighting began about 6 p.m. and lasted about 80
minutes.
   About 7,000 Marxist-led guerrillas have been waging trying to
topple the government. The war has killed about 70,000 people, most
of them civilians.

   After a hasty hearing inside an
ambulance in the Prince George's County courthouse parking lot, a
judge freed a terminally ill inmate so he can die at home.
   Ronald Lee Crockett, 38, had served five years of a 15-year
sentence for heroin possession when he was diagnosed last month as
having inoperable stomach and colon cancer. Doctors at Eastern
Correctional Institution on Maryland's Eastern Shore said Crockett
has less than six months to live.
   County Circuit Judge Audrey E. Melbourne leaned into the
ambulance Thursday and quickly suspended the remainder of
Crockett's sentence. He will return to his mother's home in
Washington, D.C..
   Crockett's mother called Melbourne several weeks ago and asked
her to reconsider Crockett's sentence.

<TEXT>
   A third of the children in Vietnam's
southern commercial center, Ho Chi Minh City, can't afford to go to
school, the Vietnam News Agency reported Friday.
   City resources are being severely strained by ``an alarming
population explosion'' of 70,000 more mouths to feed each year, the
official agency said.
   ``Every year, about 150,000 adults reaching the working age
cannot find a job. This does not include 29,000 people who stay at
home as housewives,'' it said. ``Thirty-seven percent of the
children at school age cannot afford schooling and this is one of
the many reasons for the rise in the crime rate.''
   The city of 5 million people hoped to lower the annual
population growth rate to one percent by 1990, the report said.
   ``This is no easy target because the feudalist tendency to view
happiness as synonymous with having many children still prevails
among large sections, especially peasants,'' it said.
   Under the city's family planning program, couples who have no
more than two children get preferential treatment in housing,
wages, and tourist trips, the report said.

   Rallies continued Friday in support of students
demonstrating in China, despite reports that more moderate elements
in the communist nation's leadership have been defeated.
   About 200,000 young people rallied in a downtown park to support
their counterparts in Beijing. The crowd sang patriotic songs and
listened to speeches by civic leaders, teachers and journalists who
witnessed the demonstrations in Beijing. The rally ended peacefully
after three hours.
   Reports said hard-liners in the Chinese leadership, led by
Premier Li Peng, have won a power struggle against moderates,
headed by Communist Party head Zhao Ziyang.
   Rallies also were reported in Kowloon across the harbor from
Hong Kong and in Tai Po in the countryside.
   Students also continued a sit-in outside the Xinhua News Agency,
a British colony that is to revert to Chinese control in 1997.

   Pope John Paul II met Friday with a Cuban
official for talks believed to focus on a possible papal visit to
the communist island nation.
   The Vatican provided no details of the meeting with Jose Felipe
Carneado, chief of the government office for religious affairs.
   Recent published reports from Cuba said he would be traveling to
Rome with a formal invitation and message from Cuban President
Fidel Castro.
   Cuba's Roman Catholic bishops recently invited the pope, a
necessary action before John Paul agrees to visit a country. No
date was mentioned but there has been speculation such a visit
could take place in 1990 or 1991.
   John Paul recently applauded improvements in the church's
ability to carry out its mission in Cuba.
   Cuba has been officially atheist since the communist revolution
30 years ago, but Havana and the Holy See have maintained
diplomatic relations.

   The apparent demise of Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang has proven again that heirs to power in China often end up
on the fast track to oblivion.
   As head of the 47 million-member ruling party, Zhao was in line
to succeed Deng Xiaoping as China's untitled but undisputed leader.
Many had predicted that Deng, 84, would retire by the end of the
year.
   Sources now say Zhao has been stripped of his post after
crossing with Deng over the handling of the pro-democracy student
uprising. Zhao was sympathetic with its goals and sought
compromise; Deng demanded a crackdown and declared martial law in
Beijing.
   Zhao is hardly the first to be raised up, only to be slapped
down by an autocratic ruler.
   The most recent was Zhao's predecessor, Hu Yaobang, who was
forced to resign in similar circumstances in January 1987.
   Hu also was Deng's unofficially designated successor until
student demonstrations in December 1986 kindled a battle between
party hardliners and moderates. Deng, an economic reformer with
conservative views on political reform, moved to stamp out
``bourgeois liberalization,'' or favoring Western ideas.
   Hu was ousted for being too soft on the students, and it was his
death April 15 that triggered the recent, bigger unrest.
   The most tragic case of a deposed No. 2 was that of Liu Shaoqi,
one of Mao Tse-tung's earliest supporters. By the 1950s he was
Mao's second-in-command, and in 1959 became head of state.
   But Mao turned on Liu during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution,
branding him a traitor. Liu and his wife were personally humiliated
in Red Guard struggles, and he is believed to have died in prison
in 1969.
   Liu's downfall in the Cultural Revolution was paralleled by the
rise of Defense Minister Lin Biao. A party congress in 1969
formally named Lin vice chairman and designated him as Mao's
successor.
   But Lin plotted to assassinate Mao in 1971 so he could seize
power before rivals could mount a challenge to his position.
According to official accounts, his conspiracy was uncovered and he
was killed in a plane crash while trying to flee to the Soviet
Union.
   Mao's next designated heir, Hua Guofeng, did make it to the top,
but his stay was short-lived. In 1976, backed by Mao's reported
deathbed comment ``with you in charge, I'm at ease,'' Hua arrested
the leftist ``Gang of Four'' led by Mao's wife and assumed
leadership of the party and government.
   But Hua, who spent most of his career in the provinces, was no
match for Deng, who was purged during the Cultural Revolution but
came back after the decade of chaos to steadily gain supporters for
his new pragmatic policies.
   By 1978, Deng was in charge and Hua was heading to the
sidelines. Today he is a little-seen and much-ignored party cadre.

   U.S. military officials searching for
bodies of American servicemen missing in Laos since the Vietnam War
were forced to return to Bangkok on Friday because of tropical
storm Cecil, a U.S. diplomat said.
   The 15-man team will remain in Bangkok until weather conditions
around the excavation site improve before going back to begin
excavation a crash site in southern Laos, said U.S. Embassy
spokesman Ross E. Petzing.
   Petzing said the group of experts from the Joint Casualty
Resolution Center and the army Central Identification Laboratory,
both in Hawaii, arrived in Savannakhet Province on Friday, but they
couldn't fly to the site because of the storm.
   The storm lashed the coast of central Vietnam of Thursday,
destroying houses and sinking boats, the Vietnam News Agency
reported. It flooded tens of thousands of acres of rice nearing
harvest, the report said.
   The planned excavation would be the sixth joint project between
the United States and Laos since the war. Previous digs have
resulted in the recovery of remains of U.S. servicemen.
   The United States says 2,360 Americans are missing in Indochina,
with 545 of them missing in Laos.

   Kenya will send home hundreds of
Zimbabweans who settled in the east African nation while on aborted
pilgrimages to Jerusalem generations ago, it was reported Thursday.
   The Harare and Nairobi governments have agreed to work together
to ensure a ``planned and orderly'' exodus, Zimbabwe Foreign
Affairs Minister Nathan Shamuyarira told the Zimbabwe Inter-African
News Agency.
   About 400 black families of the Apostolic Faith, a church
founded in Zimbabwe in 1929, traveled north in the 1940s and 1950s
in the hope of reaching Jerusalem. Most abandoned the pilgrimage
when they reached Kenya, mainly because they were short of money.
   Many of the men of the church now hold key posts in commerce,
industry and agriculture.
   The repatriation is part of a Kenyan exercise to send home
illegal aliens, African diplomatic sources told The Associated
Press.
   About 300 foreign Africans, including Zimbabweans, were ordered
to go home by a Nairobi court this week.
   Several families of the Apostolic Faith recently returned to
Zimbabwe voluntarily, Shamuyarira said.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 4th graf, `The commission ...' with signs

<BYLINE>By FRANK BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A low-power atomic testing license was
approved today for the Seabrook nuclear power plant, which has been
a focus of the anti-nuclear movement since the project was
conceived two decades ago.
   ``The people here feel it's really about time,'' an elated
Edward Brown, president of Seabrook operator New Hampshire Yankee,
told reporters Thursday after a favorable court ruling in
Washington late in the day.
   That court action cleared the way for the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission to formally issue the low-power license. NRC spokesman
Frank Ingram said the commission staff granted the license shortly
after 9 a.m. today.
   The commission approved the move a week ago but delayed the
paperwork to allow for appeals.
   Signs were posted in the Seabrook administration building
celebrating the decision. One read, ``License Received! A time for
pride. A time for power.''
   Although the plant has been the site of numerous protests over
the years, there were no demonstrators outside the facility this
morning.
   Seabrook's first chain reaction could start within two weeks.
Plant officials said today they expected to start preparations for
the tests this weekend.
   A low-power license allows a reactor to operate at 5 percent
capacity.
   Most of the plant's 1,400 workers had already gone home by the
time the court ruled, Seabrook spokesman Ron Sher said, ``but for
those people seen here there were certainly a lot of smiles and
congratulations.''
   ``There's certainly a sense of relief, and also a sense of
satisfaction that all of the work that we've done for so long to
get us to this point will allow us to do what we've been ready to
do _ and that is prepare the plant for the generation of
electricity,'' Sher said.
   Ten years behind schedule and 10 times over budget, the $6
billion plant has been a focus of the nation's anti-nuclear
movement.
   Located on marshland less than two miles from the state's most
popular beach, near Interstate 95 and only 40 miles from Boston,
Seabrook was the target of mass protests including one that
resulted in 1,414 arrests in 1977.
   Sixteen months ago, lead plant owner Public Service Co. of New
Hampshire was forced by its Seabrook debt to seek bankruptcy
reorganization.
   Finished nearly three years ago, Seabrook has remained idle
principally because of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' refusal
to cooperate in emergency planning. Based on a study triggered by
the Soviet nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in April 1986, Dukakis
declared that safe evacuation of people around Seabrook could not
be assured.
   The NRC since has accepted, pending a detailed study in
progress, emergency plans submitted by Seabrook's owners, 12
utilities serving much of New England.
   Seabrook foes promise to continue fighting and insist that that
their chances are better when the issue becomes commercial
operation.
   ``We're not out of this by a long shot,'' said Massachusetts
Attorney General James Shannon, probably the key player in the
anti-Seabrook fight.
   Seabrook's Brown insisted that safety concerns will not prevent
commercial operation. ``I said it before and I'll say it again
today: Seabrook Station is the safest power plant that's ever been
built,'' he said.
   Brown spoke at a news conference less than an hour after the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington turned down a
last-ditch appeal by Shannon and others to block the tests.
   They argued that tests should not start until all health and
safety issues, including evacuation planning, are resolved.
   But the one-page order from the three-judge appeals panel said:
``Petitions have failed to demonstrate the requisite irreparable
injury and likelihood of success on the merits to warrant the
preliminary relief sought.''
   Plant officials said the license would be picked up by employees
at Seabrook's licensing office, which is near NRC headquarters.
Plant spokesman Rob Williams said Thursday that the license, and
accompanying books of technical specifications, would be flown to
Seabrook.
   Seabrook officials said testing should begin within 10 days.
   The NRC approved the low-power license after Seabrook officials
set up a $72.1 million fund to cover the estimated added costs of
mothballing the plant if it undergoes low-power testing but never
operates commercially.

Heart</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOLIET, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man with two bullet wounds in his heart
was saved by doctors who plugged the holes with their fingers until
he could be transferred to a hospital with the needed equipment.
   The gunshot victim, Tommy Lee Hairston of Joliet, underwent open
heart surgery at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood on
Thursday after doctors kept him alive during the helicopter flight
from Joliet, 25 miles away.
   Hairston, 29, was listed in critical condition this morning, but
is expected to recover, said nursing surpervisor Linda Krzemienski.
A neighbor who had a dispute with Hairston was charged with
attempted murder.
   Dr. Robert Freeark, chief of surgery at Loyola, said doctors
have had to use their fingers to plug wounds in the heart before,
but he had never heard of a patient being kept alive for such a
distance under such circumstances.
   ``To my knowledge, no one has ever transferred a patient by any
means _ ambulance or certainly helicopter _ from one hospital to
another while a surgeon had a finger occluding (blocking) a hole in
the heart,'' Freeark said.
   Dr. Wendy Marshall, a trauma surgeon and director of Loyola's
trauma center, was awakened at 5 a.m. Thursday by an urgent call
from doctors at Silver Cross Hospital in Joliet.
   They said they were using nothing but their fingers to plug two
bullet holes in Hairson's heart and ``couldn't couldn't stop the
bleeding,'' Ms. Marshall recounted.
   She took a medical helicopter to Joliet, where she used her own
fingers to plug the holes as the victim was flown back to Maywood.
Three times, when the man's heart stopped, she squeezed it to get
it going again.
   ``Anyone who has got a blood pressure can be saved,'' she said.
``So you go for it.''
   Hairston, a landscaper, was shot Wednesday night after an
argument with a neighbor over missing property, police said. The
neighbor, Robert Knox, was charged with attempted murder, armed
violence and unlawful use of a weapon, police said.
   Hairston was rushed to Silver Cross, where he was operated on
immediately but his heart was not opened up. However, after
surgery, Hairston started bleeding again.
   ``This time, the surgeon opened Hairston up and found two holes
in his heart,'' Freeark said.
   Because Silver Cross didn't have the proper equipment for the
open-heart surgery, Ms. Marshall was summoned and Hairston was
transferred to Loyola. By Thursday afternoon, Hairston had awakened
a few times, which is considered a positive sign, Ms. Marshall said.

   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens was convicted
today of having sex with a 16-year-old girl whose mother accused
the congressman of offering a government job to buy her silence.
   The jury returned the verdict after deliberating for about one
hour.
   Lukens, R-Ohio, showed no emotion when the verdict was read.
   The 58-year-old divorced congressman was charged with
contributing to the to the unruliness and delinquency of a minor, a
misdemeanor that carries a maximum sentence of 180 days in jail and
a $1,000 fine.
   Franklin County Domestic Relations Judge Ronald Solove ordered a
presentence investigation but did not set a sentencing date.
   Lukens stood during the reading of the verdict. Afterward, he
remained at the defense's table momementarily and then was escorted
out of the courtroom by his legal adviser. He made no comments to
reporters.
   The girl, Rosie Coffman, was not in the courtroom when the
verdict was announced. Neither was her mother, Anna, who also
testified during the trial.
   Asked for comment, Luken's chief of staff, Bill Jarrell, looked
down, shook his head and whispered, ``Not now.'' He said he did not
know whether Lukens would go back to Washington immediately or stay
in Columbus.
   Mark Serrott, an associate of Lukens' attorney, Thomas Tyack,
said the verdict would be appealed.
   The prosecutor said in summation arguments that Lukens
endangered the girl's morals, but Lukens' attorney attacked the
16-year-old's reputation.
   ``You've got to have some morals to get them endangered, don't
you?'' Tyack said in his closing statement.``This is a classic case
of throwing something against the wall and see if something
sticks.''
   Lukens smiled as he entered the courtroom for the fifth day of
his trial. But he became tense as Assistant Prosecutor Rita Mangini
summarized her case before the jury.
   Lukens gave the girl alcohol, paid for her cab ride to his
apartment and had sex with her, Ms. Mangini said.
   He also tried ``to get her to commit a lesbian act with another
... individual,'' she said. Lukens also caused Ms. Coffman ``to
associate with immoral persons, namely the defendant.''
   In testimony Thursday, a private investigator said Lukens
expressed fear for his political career the night he admitted that
he had sex with a minor.
   J.D. Caudill testified that Lukens became emotional after he
made the admission.
   In previous testimony, Ms. Coffman's mother said Lukens tried to
bribe her with an offer to help her find a government job. Lukens
claims she was trying to extort money from him in exchange for her
silence.
   After four days of testimony and seven witnesses, the
prosecution rested its case. The defense called no witnesses.
   Lukens refused to answer outside the courtroom Thursday when
asked why he did not take the stand.
   Caudill, who was hired in January by Lukens' former attorney,
Jose Lopez, to administer a polygraph test to Lukens, testified
that Lukens confessed to having sex with Ms. Coffman after
initially denying the allegation.
   ``He admitted that he did have sexual intercourse with Rosie
Coffman,'' said Caudill, a former Dayton police officer.
   He also said Lukens expressed fear for his political future.
   ``He told me that this was really going to destroy his career,
that he had been dating a lady in Washington and he didn't know how
he would tell her about this,'' Caudill said.
   Lukens served two terms in Congress in the 1960s and was elected
to the Ohio Senate before returning to Congress in 1986.

<HEAD>Indiana Jones' Hat and Coat Donated to Smithsonian</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Would that world famous archeologist, Indiana
Jones, ever have imagined? His own hat and jacket have become the
nation's artifacts.
   The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American
History greeted with pretentious pomp Friday the arrival of its new
objects: Indy's brown fedora and worn leather jacket.
   They were presented by Harrison Ford, the actor who has played
the daring archeologist in two hit movies.
   ``I was surprised, flattered'' at the invitation, he insisted,
although the whole thing was timed perfectly to plug the third Indy
movie just out.
   His trademark attire isn't going on immediate display. But
museum officials said it may someday take its place alongside such
pop-culture treasures as Superman's cape, Dorothy's slippers and
Howdy Doody himself in the History of American Entertainment
Collection.
   Ford and his gifts were welcomed at a news conference, with as
many cameras as any at the White House. Museum director Roger
Kennedy had Ford sign a ``deed of gift'' and did his best to find
some profound significance in Indy, Ford, and what they reflect in
American culture.
   Ford, as Indy, fights ``high-density mythological structures''
and brings the viewer ``escape from the bureaucratization of
American life,'' the museum director said. He said Indy ``has a
kind of redemptive diffidence.''
   How's that?
   ``He is us at our baffled best,'' Kennedy said. ``Mr. Ford has
found a place for us in American drama. He has also managed to make
it fun.''
   Ford's aw-shucks reply: ``That's rather more about me than I had
any notion. I'm flattered to be here and have these artifacts on
display.''
   He donned the fedora for begging photographers, playfully
flipped up the bill, and answered all the usual movie-star
questions.
   No, he won't play Han Solo again in another Star Wars sequel.
Adoring fans, he said, are ``very satisfied customers,'' a bit
disturbing ``but it's a fair deal.''
   For the record, the artifact facts: the fedora is size 7\; the
jacket is custom made in London, no size given.
   And no, they weren't the only ones he wore in the films. He's
kept one jacket for himself. ``I'm sure all the rest have been
destroyed _ shredded,'' he said, not convincing anyone.
   So, what would Indy Jones think of all this?
   ``He'd say, `thank you very much,''' Ford said.

<HEAD>HHS Secretary Predicts Period of `Great Tension' in Medicine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W.
Sullivan told medical school graduates Friday they face ``a period
of great stress and great tension in medicine.''
   He said this country ranks first in the world in per capita
expenditures for health care, with those costs currently consuming
almost 12 percent of U.S. gross national product and continuing to
rise ``at an unsustainable rate.''
   ``Yet, the United States lags far behind other industrialized
countries in some basic indicators of health status: life
expectancy, maternal mortality and an infant mortality rate of 10.4
deaths per 1,000 live births, which ranks us 19th in the world,''
Sullivan said.
   Sullivan, himself a physician and former medical dean at
Morehouse College in Atlanta, spoke at commencement ceremonies for
the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health
Sciences.
   He said ``certain segments of our population lag unconscionably
in health status and in access to health care,'' namely blacks,
Hispanics, native Americans, rural people and inner-city residents.
   ``In fact, parts of cities and some counties in our country have
health indices no better than those of Third World countries,'' he
said.
   Sullivan urged the medical school graduates to become ``21st
century renaissance health professionals'' who are not only
technically competent but sensitive to a broad range of issues
involving health care across the United States and around the globe.

<TEXT>
   Israeli and Syrian warplanes patrolled
the sky Friday, and reports circulated that Syria was holding
maneuvers and sending reinforcements for its battle with Lebanese
Christians.
   Syrian troops and Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian army units fired
machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades across Beirut's
sectarian dividing line for two hours. Police said no casualties
were reported.
   An Arab League summit in Morocco, agreed to call for Syrian
withdrawal from Lebanon, then dropped the demand. Syria has 40,000
soldiers in the country under a peacekeeping mandate granted by the
league in 1976, when the Lebanese civil war was a year old.
   An explosion was reported in the densely populated Abu Samra
neighborhood of Tripoli, a Syrian-controlled port about 35 miles
north of Beirut, the Lebanese Red Cross said. The cause was not
known immediately.
   ``It started a fire, but no details are available because
telephone contacts with Tripoli are down,'' a Red Cross spokesman
said.
   The U.S. Embassy denied a report by the daily Al-Anwar,
published in Christian east Beirut, that Aoun's Christian cabinet
had expelled Charge d'Affaires Daniel Simpson for policies
``hostile'' to Lebanon.
   An embassy spokesman, who would not let his name be used, said
Simpson ``was asked by the American government to go back to
Washington as a routine measure. He left yesterday.''
   Al-Anwar said Simpson was told ``to leave Lebanon in 48 hours
because the constitutional Lebanese government considers him
persona non grata due to his hostile stands and practices.''
   Christian newspapers have accused Simpson of supporting Syria's
role in Lebanon.
   In addition to comanding the 20,000 Christians of Lebanon's
army, Aoun also leads one of the two rival governments that
resulted from a political crisis last September. Premier Salim Hoss
heads the Moslem cabinet.
   Artillery duels with Druse militiamen, soon joined by the
Syrians, began March 8, two days after Aoun's forces blockaded
illegal ports operated by Moslem militias.
   As the intensity increased, Aoun declared the fight a war of
liberation against the Syrians and said his goal was to drive them
from the country. More than 350 people have been killed and nearly
1,400 wounded, nearly all of them civilians.
   Israel radio said the Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Cabinet
met to discuss reports that Syria had sent an armored armored
brigade and helicopter-borne commandos into Lebanon.
   In Damascus, the official Syria Times said Syrian army,
artillery, and air force units conducted mock attacks on ground
troops, but did not say where the exercise took place.
   Syrian television quoted the defense minister, Gen. Mustafa
Tlass, as saying without elaboration: ``The maneuver on a
full-stage battle against the enemy was successful.''
   A reliable source in Damascus, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he was ``almost certain'' the maneuvers did not
take place in Lebanon.
   Both the Christians and Syrians have stockpiled weapons and
ammunition in the relative calm of a partially successful
cease-fire the Arab League called two weeks ago.
   Reports have circulated in Lebanon that the Syrians plan an
assault on the 310-square-mile enclave east of Beirut where about 1
million Christians live.
   On Thursday, the Markaziyeh newsletter published in the
Christian sector said 40 Syrian tanks and armored personnel
carriers had entered Lebanon and taken positions in mountains south
and east of Beirut that overlook the Christian enclave.
   A spokesman for Aoun's Christian army units said two Israeli
warplanes broke the sound barrier at 35,000 feet over the Chouf
mountains southeast of Beirut at noon Friday.
   The planes drew heavy anti-aircraft fire from Walid Jumblatt's
Druse militia but no hits were observed, he said.
   Earlier, four Syrian jets criss-crossed the Christian enclave
and Beirut at high altitude, flying ``from the northern border to
Beirut for more than an hour,'' the spokesman said.

   Determined to prevent the terrorist attacks that
marred the last visit to Italy by an American president, police
adopted extraordinary security measures Friday to protect President
Bush.
   ``Rome is in a state of siege,'' said the state-run RAI
television.
   Elite Carabinieri paramilitary policemen, armed with submachine
guns and wearing bulletproof vests, guarded the U.S. Embassy on Via
Veneto, the U.S. ambassador's residence a mile away and other
American interests.
   Wary of possible car bombs, police roped off adjacent streets
into no-parking zones.
   Authorities said more than 1,000 uniformed and plainclothes
police had been deployed for security duties during Bush's
three-day visit. Sharpshooters were posted on rooftops along Bush's
motorcade route.
   Via Veneto, once synonymous with the ``Dolce Vita'' era of
nightclubs and movie stars, was lined with pairs of policemen every
few dozen feet.
   A blue police van was parked in front of the embassy gates, and
another was stationed across the street in front of the Hotel
Ambasciatori.
   The U.S. embassy sits at the heart of what is known as the
``triangle of death,'' an area whose embassies, airline offices and
popular tourist cafes have been a target of Arab terrorists. More
than a dozen attacks, killing five people, have occurred in the
area since 1979.
   On Wednesday, police explosives experts were called in to remove
a suspicious car parked across from the embassy compound. They blew
out the windows to get inside, but it turned out to be a false
alarm.
   Police vans were also parked at every corner of the Villa
Taverna, the seven-acre compound in the posh Parioli district where
U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Rabb lives. Bush will be spending Friday
and Saturday nights at the 17th century villa.
   Rabb served throughout Ronald Reagan's eight-year presidency and
had been scheduled to leave last week but extended his stay because
the Senate has not yet acted on Bush's nomination of Michigan
businessman Peter Secchia.
   The most recent anti-American terrorist attacks in Rome occurred
June 9, 1987, as President Reagan and other leaders of the world's
major industrialized nations were holding a summit meeting in
Venice.
   First, a car bomb exploded on Via Boncompagni along the side of
the U.S. Embassy compound, damaging other parked cars and blowing
out two large windows in the nearby Hotel Excelsior. Except for an
Italian woman passer-by who suffered from shock, there were no
injuries.
   Less than an hour later, two homemade rockets were fired over
the gates of the U.S. Embassy, causing minor damage but no
injuries. A similar rocket landed harmlessly in an ornamental pool
at the British Embassy, about a half-mile away.
   The rockets aimed at the U.S. Embassy were launched from the
balcony of a fifth-floor room of the Hotel Ambasciatori.
   The terrorists were never caught, but Italian authorities pieced
together descriptions of suspects and issued arrest warrants for
members of the Japanese Red Army, a Lebanese-based group sponsored
by Libya.
   The same group was blamed for the car bomb attack on a U.S.
servicemen's club in Naples in April 1988 that killed five people,
including an American woman.
   Security was also stepped up Friday at airports and train
stations. Authorities said police helicopters and restricted air
routes would be used for Bush's trips by helicopter.
   Police said the strict security measures were taken as a
precaution, not because they had received any threats or
indications of terrorist activity.
   Despite the tight security, advertisements were published in
Rome newspapers Friday inviting the public to the Memorial Day
ceremony Bush is scheduled to attend Sunday at the American World
War II cemetery in Nettuno, about 45 miles south of Rome.

   A fire aboard a diesel-powered attack submarine
forced the vessel to the surface, but there were no injuries
reported in the second accident involving a San Diego-based
submarine this week, the Navy said.
   The Blueback was on the surface off the Southern California
coast, awaiting a tow and further damage assessment, said Lt. Sonja
Hedley, spokeswoman at the Naval Submarine Base, San Diego. Damage
appeared to be minor.
   The sub, which carries a crew of 65 enlisted and eight officers,
was on general training operations when the electrical fire broke
out Thursday in the propulstion system, Ms. Hedley said.
   On Tuesday, the nuclear-powered attack sub Grunard ran aground
on a reef four miles offshore, but was freed and returned to port.
No injuries were reported in that accident.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Refuses to Indict Mother in Cocaine Baby Death Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with grand jury refusing to indict mother
on manslaughter charge in second case, in which baby died. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury refused to indict a young
mother for manslaughter in her infant's death, which was linked to
alleged cocaine use during pregnancy, authorities said today.
   Prosecutors had charged Melanie Green, 24, with involuntary
manslaughter and delivery of a controlled substance to a minor, a
charge usually used against street-corner drug dealers.
   A Winnebago County grand jury that met Thursday did not indict
her on any charge, State's Attorney Paul Logli said.
   Ms. Green's 2-day-old baby, Bianca, died Feb. 4. Cocaine was
found in Bianca's system and in her mother's, said Dr. P. John
Seward, the county coroner. The drug was carried through the
placenta to the fetus, reducing Bianca's ability to accept oxygen
from the mother and resulting in brain damage.
   Logli had characterized that process as delivery of a controlled
substance.
   Ms. Green had accepted an offer of free representation from the
American Civil Liberties Union in the case.
   In a similar case, another mother in this northern Illinois city
of 140,000 was convicted May 1 of prenatal child abuse for using
cocaine throughout her pregnancy, including the hours right before
she gave birth. That child survived.
   On Thursday, the mother, whose name was not released because she
is a juvenile, regained custody of her 6-month-old daughter. But
Judge Frederick J. Kapala made the custody arrangement temporary,
pending a hearing July 6 in which the woman must demonstrate that
she can give the baby a good home.
   ``If the mother is making progress and shows she is providing a
nurturing environment for the child, the state is considering
placing (full) guardianship with the mother,'' Assistant State's
Attorney Gary Golian said.
   The child was placed in a foster home after Kapala found the
woman guilty May 1 of prenatal abuse.
   At the time, the judge said he was forced to ``take a stand'' on
the issue of fetus rights after testimony showed the woman had used
cocaine up to a few hours before birth.
   The woman has completed a drug rehabilitation program, said her
attorney, Alberto F. Altamore.

   From grand opera to chamber music,
marionettes to Mozart, the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. will serve up a
smorgasbord of the arts over the next 16 days in Charleston.
   The 13th edition of the festival, founded by composer Gian Carlo
Menotti, opened today with a ceremony on the steps of City Hall.
   ``Let the music begin, let the dancers dance, let the choirs
sing and let the children play,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.
announed in his traditional proclamation. ``I hereby declare that
the 13th Spoleto Festival U.S.A. has begun.''
   Chamber music, Bellini's opera ``La Straniera,'' and Eileen
Heckart and Joanna Gleason in the Lee Blessing play
``Eleemosynary'' were on tap for the festival's opening day.
   During the festival, 111 performances will be presented before
Spoleto closes amid a thundering fireworks display over Middleton
Place Plantation on June 11.
   Festival organizers were predicting a record box office, with
ticket sales running $127,000 ahead of last year, festival
spokeswoman Ann Wilson said Thursday. Almost $1.2 million in
tickets have been sold compared to $1.32 million sold during the
entire festival last year.
   Even before this year's festival opened, three productions were
acknowledged hits.
   Tickets for ``The Marriage of Figaro'' _ directed by Menotti _
sold out two days after the box office opened in March.
   Only a handful of tickets remain for the return engagement of
the Colla Family Marionettes. The Italian puppets were one of the
highlights of the 1987 festival.
   The Young Conductors Concert featuring little-known works by
Mozart is also a sellout.
   ``Everything else has some tickets left on certain dates,'' said
Mrs. Wilson. ``There's plenty left, especially in the final week.''
   Other major events at the festival include Laurie Anderson
premiering her newest work, titled ``Empty Places'' in which 10,000
images will be juxtaposed to music on more than a dozen moveable
screens at the Gaillard Municipal Auditorium.
   The Boston Ballet and the Trisha Brown Company will also perform
and there will be a performance of Mozart's ``Requiem.''
   Menotti started a festival in Spoleto, Italy, in 1957 with the
aim of merging the cultural worlds of Europe and America. In 1977
he took the festival to Charleston, and in 1986 he expanded the
project to Melbourne, Australia.

   Conservatives who gained control of the Communist
Party leadership in a bitter power struggle activated time-tested
education mechanisms Friday for ensuring control at the grassroots
as well.
   The television news said party members and soldiers attended
lengthy meetings to study May 19 speeches in which Premier Li Peng
and President Yang Shangkun announced troops would ``restore
order'' after more than a month of student-led protests for
democracy.
   Political study sessions have been an important element of the
party's grassroots control during 40 years of rule. Once top
leaders set a new party line, meetings routinely are called at
every level to study it, from the Central Committee down to the
local cell.
   Party members then are expected to take the lead in educating
non-members at study sessions in workplaces and mass organizations.
   In the current power struggle, the meetings will be especially
important because so many party members, security forces and
Beijing residents took part in the demonstrations now being
denounced.
   Army cadets, soldiers of the logistics department, police, the
Communist Party's Youth League and employees of government
ministries were among the marchers.
   The party, never satisfied with simply issuing an order from
above, will be trying to win over as many people as possible and
frighten the rest into silent cooperation. Party members who
shouted, ``Down with Li Peng!'' in the anonymity of a crowd of
hundreds of thousands will be unlikely to dare speak out in a small
study session of their peers.
   Chinese sources said the main texts being studied Friday were
the speeches Li and Yang made on national TV just before declaring
martial law in parts of the capital; an internal report on the
protests by Beijing's party chief; and speeches made Thursday by
Yang and former President Li Xiannian at a Politburo meeting that
voted to back the hardliners.
   Party members praised the Li and Yang speeches as ``very
important'' and said they ``represented the will of the entire
party,'' the nationally televised evening news said.
   The television also showed troops who have been ordered to
impose martial law taking part in study sessions. The troops have
been quartered on the outskirts of Beijing since last weekend when
hundreds of thousands of citizens blocked their way into the
capital.
   The ``dare-to-die units'' of citizens who blockaded the troop
trucks administered their own kind of propaganda, lecturing the
soldiers for hours on end about the student protesters' goals of
increasing democracy and wiping out corruption. They gave the
soldiers food, water and cigarettes and urged them not to hurt the
students.
   In an apparent effort to counteract the people's propaganda,
army officers lectured the troops Friday on their martial law
mission.
   The television showed soldiers sitting in small groups in their
tents, their bedrolls neatly stashed behind them, studying a harsh
letter from the top army command that claimed a small group of
people were using the students to attack the party leadership.
   Education has yet to begin in earnest in ordinary workplaces,
where most efforts so far have been directed at keeping employees
from joining demonstrations. Some employers have threatened
dismissal or fines for anyone who marches, others have tried to
bribe workers with free food and drink to stay in.
   Some large workplaces also formed worker militias, ostensibly to
help keep order on the streets but in reality to keep workers
occupied at night.

   Finding this room with a view was no problem for
Isaac, Sarah, Linda and Hector.
   But the bulldozers? They will definitely be a problem.
   All four live in a squalid yet sophisticated cluster of shacks
on the elevated West Side Highway, overlooking the Hudson River in
Manhattan. The 15-block stretch of highway, raised on rusting
girders, has been closed since a truck fell through the decaying
roadway in 1973.
   Workers started razing the highway 11 blocks up on Thursday and
will inch their way downtown. The shack residents vow to stay until
the last moment.
   ``We've moved them a few times and they just keep returning,''
said Samuel I. Schwartz, deputy transportation commissioner. ``They
like the vista and many are attached to the setting. But there'll
come a day when they can't return.''
   Once, the highway was dotted with dozens of trash-strewn huts of
plywood, nails, carpet remnants and blue plastic tarp. Just four
remain.
   Early Thursday, a police officer rapped his nightstick on the
hut that Linda, Hector, Sarah and Isaac share. ``You've got to get
out _ we're bringing dynamite,'' said the officer.
   This, though, is their home. They tap electricity from a light
pole to run their television, cooler, lights, heater, even a vacuum
cleaner. The women, both soap opera buffs, seldom miss ``Loving''
and ``General Hospital.''
   ``It's peaceful and it's calm up here. Sometimes, sightseers
come by and take pictures. I guess they think we're all maniacs,''
Isaac said, as tourists gawked from the deck of the Intrepid, an
aircraft carrier-turned-museum.
   Isaac, who described himself as an out-of-work carpenter,
plumber and electrician, said he once shared a girlfriend's
condominium. When that fizzled out, he moved onto the highway in
November. His friends joined him last winter.
   ``I'm not homeless,'' he says emphatically. ``People who are
homeless are living on the subway; they don't change their
clothes.''
   It took Isaac a day to build his hut after scavenging ``a piece
here, a piece there _ nails, wire, tape.'' The address, he says
with a grin, is ``Bridge, Apartment 221.''
   He sometimes visits his sister's home. Once he caught himself
walking hunched over _ conditioning from his own 4-foot-high
ceiling. ``I straightened up right away. If they knew where I
lived, they'd say, `You're 36 years old and you're embarrassing the
family. Are you crazy?'''
   ``I'm from Ohio. If my mother saw me living like this, she'd
kill me,'' agreed his girlfriend Sarah, 34, an unemployed factory
worker and waitress.
   ``I always wanted to come to New York and I finally did. People
know your business too much in a little town. But the rent here is
so high _ you can rent a whole house in Ohio for $400 a month,''
she said.
   ``Now,'' said Isaac, ``they're telling us to go to the shelter.
What are we supposed to do: She goes to one shelter and I go to
another?'' he said, pointing to Sarah, who is three months pregnant.
   ``The shelters are not safe. I'm not going to a shelter. We
leave our TV and our clothes here, with no locks, and all our stuff
is still here when we get back. Try that in an apartment in the
neighborhood where you live. We look out for one another. Kids
don't come up here and go wilding.''
   Linda, who asked that her last name be withheld because ``I have
kids in college and it would be embarrassing for them,'' said the
hut-dwellers were ``like one big, happy family. On the street, a
guy slammed me up against a wall and put a knife up to me. That's
never happened up here.''
   Sam, another hut dweller, makes money gathering cans and scrap
metal.
   ``Whatever we have, we share,'' he said. ``And the view is nice.
I've got my Intrepid right here. I've got my view of the skyline.
My boats, they come in and out. This is the best.''
   When the dozers arrive, Sam may search for a vacant lot.
   ``I don't know exactly what I'm going to do,'' he said. ``But
I'll be here until the bitter end.''

<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam has
named new armed forces commanders to replace those killed last week
in an abortive coup led by war-weary generals, Addis Ababa radio
announced.
   Mengistu also named new navy and police chiefs, but made no
mention of the fate of the former navy commander and police chief.
The appointments were made Wednesday.
   Diplomats say nearly the entire military high command was killed
in the three-day revolt crushed May 18 and subsequent purge in this
strategic nation that is the Soviet Union's strongest ally in
Africa.
   The new appointees will command the continent's largest and
best-equipped force of 325,000 troops, although many are unwilling
conscripts.
   All but two of the new military leaders are central committee
members of the Marxist Workers Party of Ethiopia, this Horn of
Africa nation's sole legal political party.
   Lt. Gen. Addis Tedla, the deputy prime minister and a Politburo
member, is the new chief of staff.
   Other appointees with their new titles are Maj. Gen. Seyoum
Mekonen and Maj. Gen. Mesfin Gebre Kal, deputy chiefs of staff; and
Maj. Gen. Embibel Ayele, commander of ground forces.
   Brig. Gen. Alemayehu Agonafir becomes air force commander while
Yfhuwal Ashet Girma was named navy commander with the rank of rear
admiral.
   Berhanu Jembere, a former ambassador to East Germany who has had
charge of the government agency dealing with drought and other
disasters, takes command of the 1st Army with the rank of major
general.
   Other appointments are: Maj. Gen. Gimar Neway, to head the
police; Maj. Gen. Wubishet Dessie, 2nd Army commander; and Brig.
Gen. Gebre Giorgis Berhanu, 2nd Army deputy commander and its
political commissar.
   No one was named defense minister to replace Maj. Gen. Haile
Giorgis Habte Mariam, who was killed by rebellious generals when he
tried to halt their coup attempt.
   The government made no mention of casualties in the mutiny.
   Initially it was announced that loyal troops killed three
generals: Maj. Gen. Merid Negussie, then chief of staff; Maj. Gen.
Amha Desta, air force commander; and Maj. Gen. Denissie Bulto, 2nd
Army commander. But Mengistu told a rally last week that the three
committed suicide rather than surrender.
   Mengistu has blamed the three dead generals for military defeats
in northern Eritrea and Tigre provinces, where it is fighting
rebels who want more power for their ethnic minorities.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front, waging a 28-year war for
secession, and the Tigrean People's Liberation Front, which seeks
more autonomy, recently have scored major victories and chased
government troops from most of the countryside and small towns.
   Many troops in the 150,000-strong 2nd Army, which has done most
of the fighting and has its headquarters in the Eritrean capital of
Asmara, backed the coup.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jane Amsterdam, editor of the New York Post for
11 months, has quit her $200,000-a-year job, two of its competitors
reported today.
   A source close to the paper, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press today that no formal action
had been taken but was expected early next week.
   ``She is not yet not the editor,'' the source said.
   A spokesman for the Post, Howard Rubenstein, would neither
confirm nor deny the reports. He said a statement by Post owner
Peter S. Kalikow may be issued later today or Tuesday.
   ``She's still working for the paper, there's no question about
that. She's still the editor'' today, Rubenstein said. He would not
comment on her plans.
   Amsterdam's secretary at the Post said Amsterdam was not in the
office today and was not expected. The secretary said all calls on
the subject were being forwarded to Rubenstein.
   Amsterdam, 37, became one of six women editing a U.S. newspaper
with a circulation larger than 100,000 on June 13. She had a
three-year contract.
   She previously was editor of Manhattan, inc. magazine and worked
for The Washington Post.
   ``There is a parting of the ways, but Jane has not been fired,''
a source closely connected with the Post told New York Newsday.
   The Daily News also quoted a source as saying, ``There was a
mutual parting of the ways.''
   Both reports said Amsterdam's resignation may have resulted over
the decision to scale back the newspaper's 11-week-old Sunday
edition.
   The Post announced it was reducing the paper to a single section
and cutting the price from $1 to 40 cents due to a lack of
advertising in the Sunday section.
   Amsterdam was heavily involved in creating the Sunday edition.
   She would be the second top news executive to leave the Post
recently. Publisher Peter Price, 48, left the newspaper last month
to begin a national sports newspaper.

   A man has been accused of illegally
trying to ship 150 wild raccoons into Georgia to train hunting dogs.
   John Braswell, 44, of Okeechobee, was charged Thursday by a
federal grand jury with conspiracy and attempted interstate
transportation of the animals. An arrest warrant was issued.
   ``These are what you call unique cases that come through the
office from time to time, some of our less-used statutes,'' said
Curtis Fallgatter, the managing assistant U.S. attorney in
Jacksonville.
   Braswell was stopped with a pickup truck full of raccoons,
authorities said.
   Fallgatter said raccoons can carry rabies and parvo virus.

<HEAD>Coelho-Jenkins Race for Majority Leader Shaping Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: Subs graf 2, The two-way, to restore missing word ``against''.

   House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho, despite
questions about his business dealings, will jump in ``with both
feet'' if the majority leader's position becomes vacant, setting up
a likely confrontation with Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., congressional
sources said today.
   The two-way race for the No. 2 leadership post shaped up as,
sources said, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., had decided against
seeking the job.
   The jockeying came in expectation that Rep. Jim Wright, D-Texas,
would resign as House speaker next week in the wake of charges that
he committed 69 rules violations and Majority Leader Thomas Foley,
D-Wash., would replace him.
   Gephardt had been urged by some House Democrats to challenge
Coelho, whose own personal business dealings have come under
scrutiny, to spare the party further embarrassment should an ethics
probe ensue.
   One source said Gephardt was interested in running for Coelho's
current job of majority whip, the No. 3 spot in the House
Democratic heirarchy.
   Spokeswoman Deborah Johns said Gephardt was ``waiting to see
what the speaker is going to do. He's listening to people and at
this time he just hasn't made a decision.''
   Jenkins ``will be a candidate for the position when the speaker
resigns,'' said a source close to the Georgia lawmaker, who is
running with support from the powerful chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   Rostenkowski ``usually supports the members of his committee and
only one of them (Jenkins) is in the race right now,'' said a
source close to the chairman.
   None of the House sources would allow their names to be used.
   ``When a vacancy occurs for the position of majority leader, I
fully expect Tony Coelho to be in with both feet and running to
win,'' said one source.
   Asked if Gephardt would run against his close friend, Coelho,
the source said, ``That's not going to happen.'' The source
indicated the information came from a personal conversation between
the two congressmen.
   Coelho spokesman David Dreyer would not reveal the Californian's
future plans.
   Early in 1988, Coelho organized a campaign trip for several
dozen colleagues and lobbyists who flew to Iowa to boost the
presidential campaign of Gephardt. The two have remained close.
   A group of Gephardt's supporters on Thursday urged him to run,
viewing the Missouri Democrat as a ``white hat'' figure who could
help his party recover from the ethical problems that appear to
have ruined Wright's career.
   Some House Democrats worried that ethics questions recently
raised about Coelho's financial dealings could make him a political
liability if the Californian succeeded Foley as majority leader.
   But Coelho also is remembered fondly by many Democrats from his
days as the Democratic congressional campaign chairman who doled
out the money that got many of the lawmakers elected.
   Coelho not only organized the campaign trip for Gephardt, but
was present for the ex-candidate's most triumphant moment during
the 1988 Democratic primary season _ when the Missouri congressman
won the Iowa precinct caucuses on Feb. 8 that year.
   Wright is expected to resign next week just as he faces
disciplinary proceedings over House ethics committee charges of 69
rules violations.
   That would free Foley to move up to speaker and likely trigger
races for majority leader, majority whip and possibly caucus
chairman.
   Some House Democrats suggested that the party quickly elevate
Foley and allow several weeks to pass before deciding on other
leadership positions.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said he favors such a course, but
added that the Coelho camp wants the incumbents to quickly move up
the ladder.
   Coelho's strongest support appeared to come from his own
California Democratic delegation, whose chairman, Rep. Don Edwards,
said, ``We just think Tony has been the best whip in the history of
the House, and deserves to be majority leader.''
   Another Californian, Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., said he backs
Coelho for majority leader but admitted that ``members will take
into consideration the public reaction to the situation.''
   ``We must make sure nobody who is in a replacement mode has any
impediments that cause problems,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.
``If we have a secondary ethics problem, it could be very
catastrophic for our party in the House. We're on somewhat shaky
footing now and need to re-establish our stability.'
   News stories have detailed, and Coelho has confirmed, that a
California savings and loan official purchased a $100,000,
high-yield junk bond for the lawmaker in 1986 _ after Coelho found
himself unable to finance the purchase himself.
   A month later, the bank official sold the bond to Coelho for the
initial offering price, which saved the lawmaker about $4,000
compared with the market price at the time.
   House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts from anyone
with a direct interest in legislation. Coelho said he did not
violate House rules, and asked the ethics committee to review the
transaction.
   On Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported that the Justice
Department is conducting a preliminary criminal investigation of
whether Coelho received favors from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
the firm that issued the junk bond.
   Coelho said in a statement, ``I am confident the story is
inaccurate and I so advised the Los Angeles Times, which chose to
go ahead with the story anyway. In Washington's current atmosphere,
such stories based on rumors or leaks are perhaps inevitable, but
no less regrettable.''
   The Associated Press reported earlier this week that Coelho
owned an interest in a dairy management company at the same time he
was pushing legislation to help maintain the profitability of some
dairy farms.

   Israeli officials are keeping a close watch on
the Syrian military buildup in Lebanon but said Friday they see no
immediate danger to their northern border.
   The Cabinet met Thursday night about reports that a mechanized
brigade had joined the 40,000 Syrian soldiers already in Lebanon,
where a Syrian-Druse alliance has been been fighting Christian army
soldiers since early March.
   Most officials and observers said Syria's objective seemed to be
convincing the Arab summit in Morocco it would not leave Lebanon
rather than posing a threat to Israel.
   ``As long as we don't feel directly threatened, there is no way
Israel is going to intervene,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman
Alon Liel.
   Col. Renaan Gissin, deputy army spokesman, said: ``Clearly any
change of forces on the ground is a concern to us. We are watching
to see if this presents any threat to Israel's northern border or
the security zone.''
   That zone is a strip of Lebanese territory just north of the
border, varying in depth from six to 10 miles, patrolled by Israeli
soldiers and a mainly Christian surrogate militia called the South
Lebanon Army.
   Military sources said privately the army had not raised the
alert status of its border units.
   Concern about a Syrian move southward or an expansion of the
Syrian-Christian fight in Lebanon was evident, however.
   ``Any war on our northern border is not good because of the
potential to spill over,'' a government official said, on condition
of anomyity.
   Zeev Eitan, an analyst at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center
for Strategic Studies, said Israeli reconnaissance flights could be
hampered if Syria moved anti-aircraft missiles into new areas of
Lebanon.
   Ron Ben-Ishai, military correspondent of the independent daily
Yediot Ahronot, noted that military actions sometimes go beyond the
planned scope and said on army radio: ``it's known that in the
Middle East, often without intention, things can escalate.''

   Eighty percent of the nation's commercial radio
stations gave their listeners dead air for 30 seconds Friday as a
taste of what it would mean not to have radio.
   The period of silence opened a $100 million national advertising
campaign, ``Radio: What Would Life be Like Without It.''
   ``Imagine if all your days sounded like this,'' the recorded
voice of actor James Earl Jones said at 7:42 a.m. EST. Then nothing
until Jones came on again saying: ``Thirty seconds seems like a
long time, doesn't it? Now think how radio fills that silence for
you.''
   The Radio Advertising Bureau, which said about 8,000 stations
participated, called the spot the biggest simultaneous promotion in
the history of radio.
   Over the next year the campaign will produce other broadcast
commercials as well as magazine and newspaper ads to attract
potential advertisers, said Daniel Flamberg, the bureau vice
president.

   When Reijo Kela finally stepped out in
public on Friday after a week indoors, it was as though he'd never
left.
   For seven days, Kela lived inside a small glass house in a busy
section of downtown Helsinki. He ate, he bathed, he danced, he went
to the bathroom _ he did everything inside his diaphanous digs but
throw stones.
   When the 37-year-old performance artist finally emerged, he was
greeted with roses, pink champagne and applause from some of the
passersby who had watched a man live life in a fishbowl.
   ``It's just another production ... but I lived it with every
inch of my soul. Thank you all for your support,'' said Kela,
wearing a dark suit and bow tie.
   An estmated 100,000 people daily passed by Kela's temporary
home, set up on a stage near one of Helsinki's busiest public
squares. The structure, glassed-in on two sides, was equipped with
sleeping bag, stereo system, telephone, two laundry baskets, fresh
flowers and, unashamedly, a see-through bathtub.
   The week-long performance, titled ``Cityman,'' receiving $19,000
in support from Finnish cultural authorities and the Helsinki
Students Union.
   Kela made no prior announcement before turning himself into a
human goldfish on May 19.
   He said he was happy about the reactions he got from his
transparent attempt to merge art and everyday life.
   ``Some people turned nasty in the evenings, mainly drunks, and
even though I had my own personal guard nearby I found sleeping
difficult on the first two nights,'' Kela told reporters.
   ``Most people were positive. They laughed and enjoyed
themselves, which is the main thing,'' Kela said.
   Women from Kela's dance troupe provided food trays and joined
him for entertainment in the evenings.
   Kela danced to music and advertisements from commercial radio
stations that blared over loudspeakers both inside and outside the
glass bowl. He figured he danced about 10 hours daily.
   They were occasionally interrupted with recorded messages by
Kela announcing in English that he is ``the Cityman. The Best.
Everyone wants my body. Everyone would like to make love to me.''
   Kela said the message of ``Cityman'' was in the words and in his
dance. When asked if his performance was meant as a kind of social
protest, he said ``the dance speaks for itself.''
   Kela was recently granted a five-year grant from the Education
Ministry.
   Organizers from the Student Union said there were no problems
with the police or public.
   ``We only had one complaint and that was for allowing radio
commercials to be aired in public,'' he said.

<HEAD>14 Blacks Sentenced to Death For Mob Killing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Friday sentenced 14
blacks to hang for the mob killing of a black policeman, in a
ruling likely to stir widespread protest.
   Only one of the group of 13 men and a 60-year-old woman was
found to have inflicted blows that caused the death of Lucas
Sethwala. He was stoned and set afire Nov. 13, 1985, because of his
work for South Africa's racist government.
   ``The Upington trial is an outrage that only the apartheid
system can produce,'' protested the South African Council of
Churches, which includes most of the country's leading Protestant
denominations.
   ``We cannot be convinced that justice has been done,'' it said.
   The Lawyers for Human Rights organization said the 14 are the
largest group ever condemned to death for a single crime in South
Africa.
   Altogether, 25 blacks have been convicted of murder in the
killing that took place at Paballelo black township outside
Upington, a remote northwestern city.
   Eleven remaining defendants are expected to be sentenced to
prison terms. On Friday, the 14 defendants sang an African hymn as
they marched into Upington courthouse, knowing they would get death
sentences because the judge ruled Thursday there was no excuse for
their actions.
   The death sentence is mandatory for people convicted of murder
in South Africa unless the judge finds mitigating circumstances.
   Most of those sentenced Friday proclaimed their innocence before
Supreme Court Judge Jan Basson.
   ``I am an elderly woman and have been found guilty for something
I have not done,'' said Evelina de Bruin. ``Other people committed
this crime.''
   Justice Bekebeke, the only defendant found to have inflicted
blows in the killing, did not maintain his innocence. But the
24-year-old told the court the case was ``based on racial
prejudice.''
   Lawyer Andy Durbach said the sentences will be appealed.
   The so-called Upington 25 were convicted in April 1988 under the
principle of common purpose, which holds a person responsible for
crowd actions if they were part of the group.
   The day of the killing, about 3,000 blacks gathered on a soccer
field to protest rent increases.
   Police dispersed the crowd, and most went home peacefully except
for about 300 who regrouped and attacked Sethwala.
   Prosecutors said the Upington 25 were in the crowd that pelted
Sethwala's house with stones. Sethwala fired a gun out the window,
wounding a small boy. Defense lawyers said this incited the crowd
to force the victim from his house, assault him and set him ablaze.
   The judge said the killing was politically motivated, part of a
conspiracy to attack authorities.
   Basson rejected arguments that individual defendants cannot be
held accountable for actions of a crowd. One of those convicted was
described by witnesses as a close friend of the victim.
   The principle of common purpose also was used against the
``Sharpeville Six,'' a group of black men and women convicted of
slaying a black town councilor. After an international campaign,
President P.W. Botha last year commuted their death sentences to
lengthy prison terms.

   The judge who sentenced a
white racist to hang for killing seven blacks and an Indian man is
under police protection for fear of revenge attacks, newspapers
reported Friday.
   Police headquarters refused to confirm or deny reports that
Pretoria Supreme Court Justice Louis Harms, two assistants and two
prosecutors are under protective surveillance since Thursday's
sentencing of Barend Strydom.
   Strydom, 23, was convicted of killing seven people and wounding
15 blacks in a shooting spree in Pretoria on Nov. 15.
   ``There is concern that right-wing political agitators may
attack the judge and his associates,'' The Star newspaper said.
   The black taxi driver who disarmed Strydom said Friday he may
flee the area because of harassment by white extremists. Simon
Mkondeleli, 33, took refuge in a newspaper office Thursday when he
was chased by several whites after the sentencing.
   Strydom, a former policeman, belonged to the Afrikaner
Resistance Movement which seeks to establish a whites-only state.
He testified during his trial that he believes blacks are subhuman
and he wanted his attack to provoke a ``war of freedom'' to ensure
white dominance.
   The extreme Boerestaat Party has described Strydom as ``a
sensitive Afrikaner patriot'' and is campaigning for his clemency.
   In editorials Friday, pro-government newspapers said Strydom's
fanaticism is not unique.
   ``It was not just one misguided and confused young man,'' said
Beeld, the largest Afrikaans-language daily. ``The offensive
opinions of a fanatical minority were heard and found guilty.
   ``The fact that Strydom is hailed as a hero in these circles
leaves no doubt as to the viciousness of the right's sickness.''
   A more liberal newspaper, The Argus of Cape Town, said the
government's racist policies are partly to blame for Strydom's
views. It described him as ``a Frankenstein monster, lurching out
of a dark and bitter past.''
   In a separate case, the Justice Department confirmed Friday that
it has reprieved Henry Burt, a white facing execution for murdering
a black policeman. His sentence was commuted to 20 years in prison.
   Burt was convicted in 1987 of killing Sgt. Jacob Ndimande and
trying to make it appear black radicals had committed the crime by
using the ``necklace'' method. Numerous suspected government
collaborators were executed in 1984-86 by ``necklacing,'' in which
a gasoline-soaked tire is placed around a victim's neck and set
alight.

<HEAD>Yang Shangkun Emerges as Key Player in Power Struggle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Yang Shangkun, an elderly general and China's
ceremonial head of state, has emerged as a major player in the
struggle for control of the government.
   Yang, 81, has been a leading spokesman for the hardline policy
of imposing martial law on Beijing and crushing the student
uprising.
   Yang, on the night of May 19, appeared on national TV with
Premier Li Peng to announce that troops would be brought in to
restore order to the capital.
   Chinese sources said Yang also delivered a speech to party and
government leaders on Thursday that strongly condemned Communist
Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang for being sympathetic to the
student cause.
   Zhao, one of China's leading reformers, has been stripped of his
post in connection with the recent disturbances, sources say.
   Students occupying Tiananmen Square have reacted in anger to
Yang's statements, demanding that he, along with Li and Deng, step
down.
   Yang, a jovial man who is quick to smile, seems out of place in
the role of the iron-fisted disciplinarian.
   Because of his long association with senior leader Deng Xiaoping
and his public statements, he has been regarded as a solid
supporter of economic reforms and China's opening to the world.
   When he became president, or head of state, in April 1988, he
spoke of the ``longing of the people of all our nationalities for a
dramatic change in the face of the country.''
   Yang, as ranking military man in the Central Military Commission
headed by Deng, has also worked closely with Deng to bring about
reform in China's oversized, technically backward army.
   He helped direct the 1985-87 effort to reduce the size of the
People's Liberation Army from 4.2 million to about 3.2 million
people, and led the campaign to abandon Mao's concept of a
revolutionary guerrilla force in favor of a modern, well-equipped
army.
   But like Deng, Yang suffered during the turmoil of the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution, and apparently shares his aversion to social
instability. When the student movement swelled beyond control, Yang
joined Deng and the forces of law and order.
   Yang, born in 1907 in Deng's home province of Sichuan, studied
for four years in the Soviet Union before returning to join the Red
Army in the Long March, the epic 1934-35 flight from Chiang
Kai-shek's pursuing Nationalist forces.
   Always an administrator rather than a military strategist, he
became secretary-general of the party's military commission in
1945. After the communist victory in 1949, he was given the key
administrative post of director of the general office of the party
Central Committee, a post he held until the Cultural Revolution
began in 1966.
   Imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, he returned to become
deputy governor of Guangdong province in southern China in 1978,
and in 1981 rose to permanent vice chairman of the Central Military
Commission. The next year he gained a seat on the party Politburo.
   As president, his main function is to officially welcome
visiting dignitaries, and he has made a quick transition from
uniform to Western suit. But the current crisis has also shown the
personable president to be a hard military man ready to back his
superior Deng when duty calls.

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia Expels 4 Britons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia today expelled three British
diplomats and a businessman in what the Foreign Office called an
unjustified retaliation for the recent expulsion of four
Czechoslovaks from Britain.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said Czechoslovak authorities told
the British ambassador to Prague, Laurence O'Keefe, the four
Britons must leave in two weeks because of ``unacceptable
activities,'' diplomatic jargon for spying.
   ``It's clearly an unjustified action,'' said the spokesman,
speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. ``It's clearly
in retaliation.''
   He identified the four Britons as the embassy's First Secretary
of Administration Tony Arnold, First Secretary Counsellor Rick
Todd, Third Secretary Patricia Holland and a manager of Shell Oil,
Nick Brooks.
   Earlier today, the Czechoslovak Communist Party daily, Rude
Pravo, called the expulsion of its diplomats another case of
``British spymania, which certain British circles bring about from
time to time.''
   On May 19, Britain expelled eight Soviet diplomats and three
journalists and Moscow retaliated in kind a day later.
   The Soviets then demanded that Britain reduce to 205 the number
of Britons and their locally hired support staff in the Soviet
Union in order to match the quota of Soviets allowed in Britain.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons on
Thursday that the expulsions of the Soviets and the Czechoslovaks
were vital ``regardless of the effect upon our relations.'' Before
the expulsions, Britain had been enjoying its best relations with
the Soviet Union since World War II.
   Britain also had been improving relations with Czechoslovakia,
partly because British authorities want help in detecting the
Czechoslovak-made explosive Semtex used by the Irish Republican
Army and other terrorist groups.
   Sir John Fretwell, Foreign Office politcal director, said
Czechoslovakia had ignored warnings to rein in its diplomats in
September 1988, when three others were expelled.

<HEAD>Officials Say Iran and Afghanistan Making Progress Toward Peace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The governments of Afghanistan and
Iran have made progress toward ending the fighting between Afghan
troops and Moslem guerrillas based in Iran, officials said Friday.
   ``Iran is becoming increasingly important. They oppose a
military solution,'' said one Afghan government official closely
involved in the negotiations.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran was
considering telling the guerrillas based there to make a deal with
Afghan President Najib and the Soviet Union, which supports Najib.
   He said Tehran is eager to begin repatriating an estimated 2
million Afghans who have sought exile in Iran during the
11-year-old war between Afghan forces and Moslem guerrillas.
   In addition, he said, Iran wants to establish closer ties with
the Kremlin.
   The guerrillas are split into factions based in both Pakistan
and Iran.
   The Tehran-based eight-party alliance represents the Shiite
Moslem minority of Afghanistan. It is at odds with the
Pakistan-based alliance of Sunni Moslems.
   ``Tehran has been making overtures to the Soviet Union and to
our government,'' said a close adviser to the Afghan president. The
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, refused to elaborate
on the talks.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov held talks with the resistance
coalition during a four-day visit to Tehran recently.
   Senior Soviet diplomats in Kabul said Vorontsov called the talks
very good.
   The meetings were his first since the Soviet Union pulled the
last of its troops from Afghanistan on Feb. 15, ending a nine-year
military involvment.
   The Soviet officials said Vorontsov said the rebels opposed
foreign interference and wanted an Afghan government composed of
all groups. The Soviets have said they also want this.
   This week, Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub suggested
Moscow also resume talks with Afghan rebels in Pakistan.
   Moscow made contact with Afghan rebels based in Pakistan in
December, but the U.S.-backed guerrillas said they would not talk
to the Soviets until Moscow stopped aiding the Kabul government.

<TEXT>
   Deng Xiaoping, a pragmatic visionary who reversed
leftist economic policies that had devastated the economy, showed
himself a rigid hardliner in politics when he led a purge of
liberals this week.
   It was the third time in a decade of rule as China's senior
leader that Deng responded to calls for democracy with a crackdown.
For the second time, the chief victim was a former Deng protege, in
this case Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   Sources said Friday that Zhao was under house arrest after the
party Politburo voted to strip him of his post. At least one other
liberal official also was reported under house arrest, while others
were said to be in trouble.
   Deng was a hero to many Chinese a decade ago when he began his
``second revolution'' that disbanded Mao Tse-tung's communes and
allowed private enterprise.
   But the many students and supporters who paraded through the
streets of Beijing and other cities the past six weeks made him a
figure of ridicule.
   They likened him to Mao as a leader who clung hungrily to power
long after his mandate was lost.
   ``Deng Xiaoping, your time is up,'' some wrote bluntly on
posters carried in marches over the past two weeks. Children
chanted: ``Your mind is not sharp.''
   But the 84-year-old Deng, who survived two purges under Mao,
showed he was still adept in games of power.
   It apparently was at his orders that Premier Li Peng declared
martial law in central Beijing on May 20, and his power base in the
military that decided a subsequent behind-the-scenes contest
between him and Zhao.
   Deng stepped down from his main party posts in 1987 but remained
chairman of the Central Military Commission.
   Zhao told visiting Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at last
week's historic summit that the party decided in 1987 it still
needed Deng's guidance in ``most important questions.''
   In the all-important question of how to handle the widening
student-led protests, it was Deng who had the final say.
   Deng was born on Aug. 22, 1904, the eldest son of a wealthy
landowner in the southwest province of Sichuan. His original name
was Kan Zegao, but he changed it to Deng Xiaoping _ ``Little
Peace'' _ when he joined the Communist Party in 1924 while on a
work-study program in France.
   He later studied at Moscow University and returned to China to
become a guerrilla leader and party officer in the civil war
against the ruling Nationalists.
   After the Communist victory in 1949, he became vice premier
under Chou En-lai. But while Chou managed to survive the Cultural
Revolution purges of alleged ``capitalist roaders'' within the
party, Deng was a repeated victim.
   After criticizing Mao's forced communization of agriculture and
proposing material incentives to workers, he was purged in 1967 and
sent to do factory and farm labor.
   He was recalled as vice premier in 1973 but ousted again in 1976
for allegedly causing protests against the radical leaders of the
Cultural Revolution, nicknamed the ``Gang of Four.''
   His absence was short-lived: he returned to office the following
July. By then, Mao had died and the ``Gang of Four,'' including
Mao's widow, Jiang Qing, had been arrested.
   Deng consolidated his position as top leader in December 1978
and immediately began to implement the economic programs that had
caused his downfall in the 1960s. The communes were gradually
dismantled, and workers were given bonuses for extra production.
   Foreign investors and traders were welcomed and China's economy
began a 10-year boom that saw skyscrapers rise in main cities,
private factories spring up throughout the countryside and consumer
fever sweep both rural and urban areas.
   But Deng was never a liberal in the Western sense. He referred
to many of the Western cultural influences that invaded Chinese
cities along with Western investment as flies that come in an open
window. He did not favor closing the window, but recommended
installing a screen.
   In 1979, he cracked down harshly on the Democracy Wall movement,
during which hundreds of students and workers put up big-character
posters calling for democracy on a wall in central Beijing.
   Several leading Democracy Wall activists, including Wei
Jingsheng, remain in prison, reportedly in poor physical and mental
health. Deng has ignored recent calls by leading Chinese
intellectuals for their release.
   In 1987, after a wave of national student protests, Deng allowed
party conservatives to force the ouster of relatively liberal party
General Secretary Hu Yaobang. A campaign was started against
liberal thought in which several famous intellectuals lost their
jobs or party memberships. Hu, like Zhao, had been a protege of
Deng.
   In the months leading up to the latest student protests, more
and more scholars clamored for political freedoms to match the new
economic freedoms. In his last public statements before being
ousted, Zhao affirmed their position.
   Deng made it clear this won't be possible as long as he is in
charge.

<HEAD>Trimaran Great American Breaks NY-SF Sailing Record</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trimaran Great American sailed through
the Golden Gate today, snapping a 3-month-old New York-to-San
Francisco sailing record by three days after an exhausting 77-day,
14,500-mile voyage.
   Latvian-born skipper Georgs Kolesnikovs, 46, of Niagara Falls,
Canada, and crewman Steve Pettengill, 37, Newport, R.I., received a
raucous greeting from a fleet of boats which met the 60-foot,
12,000-pound vessel.
   ``We thought he was blown at the beginning,'' said Commodore
Mike Fortenbaugh of the Manhattan Yacht Club, which sponsored a
trophy for the fastest trip. ``When we were seeing him off in New
York, his was the slowest start.''
   The Great American crossed the finish _ an imaginary line
between Alcatraz Island and Pier 39 _ at 10:46 a.m., an hour short
of 77 days after leaving New York for the arduous journey around
Cape Horn. Kolesnikovs and Pettengill broke the 80-day, 20-hour
record set Feb. 12 by Warren Luhrs' sloop, Thursday's Child.
   At stake at the start of the challenges _ the Great American is
the last in a series of boats that have tried for the mark this
year _ was the 135-year-old record set by the American clipper,
Flying Cloud, which took 89 days to complete the voyage in 1854.
   Frenchman Philippe Monnet's trimaran Elle et Vire missed Luhrs'
mark by nine hours after losing a week to repairs after a collision
with an iceberg.
   Also failing to better the mark was Anne Liardet, who made the
run with fiance Joseph Le Guen aboard the 50-foot trimaran
Finisterre Bregtane. She did become the first woman to complete a
bid for the mark.
   Poised to greet Great American's crew at the end of the $300,000
effort were the families of both men and Vern Vihlene, their shore
contact.
   ``I am very nervous,'' said Kolesnikovs' 67-year-old mother,
Veta. ``I was nervous for the whole trip. I light a candle for my
son every night.''
   ``The worst time came when they lost the headstay a week ago,''
added his father, Roman, 79. ``He could have lost the mast and the
boat, but everything is alright now. My son can do anything.''
   In addition to battling uncooperative winds, the two sailors had
to contend with a broken water maker, which converts salt water to
fresh water, and damage to the cable that supports the Great
American's 75-foot mast. The cable broke loose from the deck May
18, but Pettingill was able to rig a makeshift chain link between
the deck and the cable.

   Zhao Ziyang wanted economic and political reform
to go hand-in-hand, but conservatives were determined to keep their
power and crush a student movement for democracy.
   Sources said Friday that Premier Li Peng and the old guard won
and Zhao lost his post as head of the 47 million-member Communist
Party, which had made him the most powerful man in China after
senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   They said Zhao, 69, was under house arrest, accused of
encouraging student unrest by being conciliatory.
   Although Deng is Zhao's mentor in economic reforms, the two
differ on political reform. Zhao's sympathy for the students
apparently was unacceptable.
   Just two years ago, Deng dismissed another party chief for being
too sympathetic to pro-democracy students.
   Hu Yaobang was forced to resign in January 1987 after
accusations that he was soft on students seeking a freer China.
Hu's death April 15 inspired the current student movement, which
has a far grander scale.
   Zhao had been premier for seven years when he took over the
party in November 1987. He also was appointed first vice chairman
of the Central Military Commission, of which Deng is chairman.
   He became the target of criticism a year ago when the
government, faced with annual inflation of more than more than 30
percent and panic buying as a result, began worrying that it had
lost control of the economy.
   Li and other conservatives blamed the rapid pace of
market-oriented reforms associated with Zhao. They imposed a
two-year austerity program and postponed more reform.
   This spring, the renewed student unrest made Zhao's position
even more tenuous.
   While tens of thousands of students occupied Tiananmen Square
earlier this month, he told President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the
Soviet Union political and economic reform should proceed together
and China should enjoy ``genuine democracy'' under the Communist
Party.
   He later expressed sympathy with the students demanding
democratic reforms and advocated negotiations to end the crisis. He
met with them in Tiananmen Square before martial law was imposed.
   Deng has permitted only token political liberalization and was
said to have given the order a week ago for martial law to be
declared in Beijing.
   Zhao has been a role model for the new-style Chinese leader. He
is suave and articulate, at ease in both the communist world and
the West. He wears immaculately tailored Western suits and
regularly plays golf, a sport once condemned in China as a
bourgeois luxury.
   He was born in October 1919 to a landowning family in central
China's Henan province, joined the Communist Party in 1938 and led
its committee in his native county during most of the 1937-45 war
with Japan.
   Unlike the previous generation of party leaders, he did not make
the Long March, the 7,700-mile trek northwest in 1934-35 to escape
the Nationalist government troops in eastern China.
   After the communist victory in 1949, Zhao served in regional
government and party posts. He was purged during the radical
Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, as was Deng, but was rehabilitated
long before it ended.
   Zhao gained national prominence as party secretary and governor
of Deng's home province, Sichuan, where he carried out the senior
leader's policies of dismantling farm communes and allowing private
plots and bonuses for extra work.

<TEXT>
   The U.N. Environment Program chief said
Friday he expects to have an international treaty to control
climatic changes ready for signing in three years.
   Executive director Mustafa Tolba said the decision to negotiate
a treaty with governments as soon as possible was taken at the 15th
annual conference of the program's governing council, which ended
Friday.
   Other resolutions include increasing UNEP's annual budget from
$40 million to $100 million by raising member nation's voluntary
contributions by 31 percent in 1990 and 1991.
   Delegates from 103 countries, including 44 Cabinet ministers,
attended the 12-day conference at UNEP headquarters in Nairobi.
   Tolba said delegates were alarmed by ``changing weather patterns
and increasing health risks caused by global warming.''
   He said his organization would draft the treaty in consultation
with the World Meteorological Organization.
   ``We are going to renegotiate the famous Montreal protocol,''
Tolba said. ``Its renegotiation will be more difficult than
negotiating it in the first place,'' he said of the non-binding
agreement requiring governments to reduce production of
chlorofluorocarbons, a coolant used in refrigerators and air
conditioners that helps deplete the ozone layer.
   Scientists say the depletion allows the sun's harmful
ultraviolet rays to penetrate the atmosphere and raises
temperatures on earth, which causes the oceans to rise.
   Tolba said UNEP will collect scientific data on climatic changes
and ``get scientists, at least a majority of them, to speak in one
voice.'' He hoped a scientific report would be ready late next
year. Then negotiations could begin, Tolba said.
   In negotiating the treaty, ``there would be plenty of issues,
many stumbling blocks'' he said, because it will affect every
nation's industry, agriculture, economy and forestry.

<HEAD>Consumer Spending Posts Best Performance in Nearly a Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer spending in April posted its best
performance in nearly a year, rising 1.1 percent, the government
said Friday in a report that analysts said shows the economy
remains healthy even as growth slows.
   Meantime, the government reported a sharp improvement in the
U.S. trade deficit in the opening quarter of the year as exports
jumped 5.7 percent.
   While consumer spending rose at its fastest pace since a 1.3
percent increase last June, much of the growth was attributed to a
sharp increase in auto sales because of rebates, low-interest loans
and other industry incentives to move cars off dealers' lots.
   The Commerce Department also reported that personal income rose
a weak 0.4 percent last month compared with hikes of 0.8 percent in
March and 1 percent in February. The April figure was the smallest
increase since last November's 0.2 percent.
   But analysts blamed the sluggish income growth in April on lower
farm subsidies over the past two months and a fallback from higher
auto industry bonuses and retroactive Social Security payments in
March.
   Discounting the auto sales and one-time weakness in incomes,
``what you come out with is reasonably decent income and
consumption growth which tends to make the Fed's soft-landing
scenario look more realistic,'' said analyst Cynthia Latta of Data
Resources in Lexington, Mass.
   Federal Reserve credit-tightening designed to stem inflation has
caused some economists to worry that resulting higher interest
rates could move the economy into a recession, rather than the
targeted soft landing.
   But recent reports continue to point to an economic slowdown
without recession.
   And Friday's income and spending report tells the Fed ``that so
far, so good; that there's no reason to change what they're doing
because it doesn't yet look like they're guilty of overkill,'' Ms.
Latta said.
   Sandra Shaber of The Futures Group in Washington agreed, saying,
``This certainly doesn't suggest that the economy is collapsing by
any means.''
   But Ms. Shaber said consumer spending, which recorded increases
of only 0.3 percent in March and 0.4 percent in Feburary, ``has
been kind of sluggish'' because of ``higher interest rates and an
erosion of consumer confidence.''
   On trade, the Commerce Department said the 5.7 percent jump in
exports boosted U.S. overseas sales to a record $88.5 billion
during January, February and March.
   The department said the quarterly deficit was $27.6 billion, the
smallest such imbalance in four years, compared with $32.02 billion
in the last quarter of 1988. That was a drop of 13.7 percent.
   The department's merchandise trade report, calculated on a
balance of payments basis, also registered a record $116.13 billion
in imports, but the 0.3 percent increase was smaller than the pace
of export expansion.
   In the other report, Commerce said personal income increased by
$17.7 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.37
trillion in April, while consumer spending rose $35.9 billion to an
adjusted annual $3.42 trillion rate. Consumer spending represents
about two-thirds of overall economic activity.
   The consumer spending figure includes a 3.2 percent increase in
durable goods _ big ticket items such as cars expected to last
three years or more _ to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$467.1 billion. Durable spending fell the previous two months when
auto sales were weak.
   Non-durable goods purchases rose 0.7 percent and spending on
services was up 0.8 percent in April.
   The change in disposable income _ income after taxes _
registered a flat zero last month, down from March's 0.8 percent
increase. Higher-than-usual federal income tax payments in April
because of 1986 changes in tax law resulted in much of the decline.
   The personal savings rate suffered from the increase in tax
payments, falling to 5.3 percent from a three-year high of 6.3
percent in March.
   Wages and salaries rose 0.6 percent to $2.61 trillion at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate.

   Several hundred Soviets defied a ban on
unauthorized meetings Friday and gathered in a downtown square to
criticize their new parliament hours after it defeated reformers'
attempts to sanction their gathering.
   Police with megaphones urged the crowd to disperse or go to an
approved meeting place in a giant parking lot away from the city
center, but only a handful showed up at the officially approved
meeting place.
   Authorities took no immediate action to break up the gathering
in Moscow's Pushkin Square, a frequent gathering spot for political
discussions and protests.
   ``The apparatus is still controlling everything,'' said one man
who identified himself only as a taxi driver as he discussed the
action at the Congress of People's Deputies. ``Everything is the
same as always.''
   ``You can compare the congress to an old cake,'' chimed in
another. ``They sprinkle some chocolate on the top, some democracy,
but at the bottom it's stale.''
   ``The only victory was that they managed to have some
discussion,'' said Alexander Khatov in a typical comment about
reformers at the Congress of People's Deputies convened Thursday.
   A anonymous leaflet distributed in the square said, ``A few
deputies truly elected by the people are trying to defend what has
been promised ... but everything is being done according to a
previously worked out scenario, just as it always was.
   ``What are we, the people, doing at this moment, which could
become the turning point in our history of slavery? We, the people,
are doing what we've been doing since 1917. We're looking for food
_ and now soap as well.''
   Friday's meeting followed police action to break up a similar
gathering called late Thursday by the Democratic Union, a
self-styled opposition group.
   The use of special anti-riot forces to disperse the crowd
triggered a heated quarrel Friday in the congress, where prominent
reformer Tatyana Zaslavskaya urged the parliament to ask Moscow
city authorities to lift their ban on unsanctioned political
meetings for the duration of the session.
   At the direction of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who chaired
the televised proceedings, Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin said
meetings discussing actions at the congress had taken place without
incident across the Soviet Union. The Moscow meeting was different,
he said, because it had been banned in advance by the authorities.
   The top police official's statement touched off a furor on the
congress floor. Some deputies shouted at one another, while others,
from conservative Central Asia, applauded to drown out speeches by
liberal Moscow deputies Sergei Stankevich and Andrei D. Sakharov.
   Sakharov, 68, said that despite exhaustion from 13 hours of
congress proceedings Thursday, he went to the square after being
called at home by a weeping girl. He urged his fellow deputies to
meet with the young activists after each day of Congress debate.
   ``We must not surround these people with police units,'' he
said, recalling events in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi last
month, where at least 20 people died after security forces moved
against a pro-independence protest.
   Gorbachev stopped the debate by putting Zaslavskaya's call to a
vote.
   Her proposal was defeated, with 831 deputies supporting her,
1,261 against and 30 abstaining.
   Before the results were announced, Gorbachev said he had
received word from Moscow Communist Party boss Lev N. Zaikov that
city authorities would sanction a voters' meeting in Moscow _ but
in the stadium parking lot well away from Pushkin Square.

   Suppliers promised plenty of gasoline for local
drivers and the thousands of tourists expected over the holiday
weekend, despite the loss of a pipeline providing 90 percent of the
city's supply.
   But industry officials warned that the situation could change if
motorists succumbed to panic buying in the wake of Thursday's
pipeline explosion in San Bernardino, Calif.
   ``The people of this town need to be responsible enough to not
go crazy, and not alter their purchasing habits,'' said Jack Greco,
chairman of the Nevada Gasoline Retailers Association.
   Reserves were being trucked into southern Nevada from California
refineries 300 miles away, officials said.
   The gasoline supply was disrupted by the blast at San Bernardino
knocked out the Calnev underground pipeline, the chief conduit for
gasoline and diesel fuel for the Las Vegas Valley.
   The explosion, which killed at least three people and shut the
pipeline indefinitely, was in the same place that a freight train
derailed two weeks ago and plowed into nearby houses, killing four.
Inspectors checked the pipeline after that accident and believed
that it had not been damaged.
   Holly Rea, a spokeswoman for GATX, the Chicago-based company
that owns the pipeline, said there were six days worth of gasoline
and a two-day supply of diesel fuel stored in tanks in Las Vegas.
   A spot check of some of the city's busiest stations revealed no
run on the pumps as of Friday morning.
   ``There are no long lines or anything like that,'' said P.J.
Johnson, an employee at a Texaco station at a busy intersection on
the city's east side. ``There's no big rush. Business is just
normal, I guess.''
   The concern over the pipeline disruption was heightened by the
fact that more than 100,000 visitors were expected here for the
three-day Memorial Day weekend, one of the busiest of the year in
Las Vegas. Nearly half of them were expected to come by car.
   Trucking fuel to southern Nevada will be more expensive but oil
company officials said that doesn't necessarily mean a rise in
prices at the pump. ``It will certainly increase our costs, but
we'll absorb that because we want to stay competitive,'' said
Chevron spokesman Mike Libbey.

<HEAD>First Quarter Trade Deficit Lowest in Four Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>

   The United States enjoyed its best trading
performance in four years from January through March as the deficit
fell 13.7 percent to $27.63 billion, the government reported Friday.
   The Commerce Department said that a decline in non-oil imports
and the highest level of farm exports in almost eight years helped
to lower the deficit from the fourth quarter level of $32.02
billion.
   Propelled by the higher farm sales, exports jumped 5.7 percent
in the first quarter to a new record of $88.50 billion.
   Imports hit an all-time high as well of $116.13 billion, but the
0.3 percent increase was much smaller than the pace of export
expansion.
   Friday's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance
of payments basis confirmed an improvement already noted in the
Commerce Department's monthly merchandise trade reports.
   The totals are slightly different because the new report
excludes military sales by the U.S. government to foreign
governments and makes other minor adjustments to the monthly
figures.
   While the Bush administration and some analysts are looking for
the first quarter trade improvement to continue, other private
economists expressed fears that deficit will begin widening in
coming months.
   They are particularly worried about the strength in the dollar,
which makes American products more expensive on overseas markets,
and rising oil prices, which boost the country's foreign oil bill.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. in
Lexington, Mass., predicted that the trade deficit for the entire
year will be essentially unchanged from the $127.22 billion deficit
in 1988.
   ``While agricultural sales were up sharply in the first quarter,
that sector is really threatened by the strength in the dollar
because there are so many other countries willing to supply the
products if the American price becomes uncompetitive,'' she said.
   But Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said he was
more optimistic that the U.S. trade deficit would continue
narrowing this year, helped out by faster growth overseas and
slower U.S. growth, which would cut the demand for imports.
   ``So long as the economies of the world stay strong, there is
every reason to believe that our exports will keep doing well,'' he
said.
   The Bush administration, which has staked its economic forecast
on a belief exports will keep climbing, is trying to help the
process along with aggressive efforts to open foreign markets.
   The administration on Thursday announced that it was threatening
Japan, Brazil and India with special tariffs in an effort to reduce
barriers blocking the sale of American products in those countries.
   The big jump in exports in the first quarter reflected an 11.2
percent surge in sales of American farm products, which climbed to
$10.88 billion, the highest level since the second quarter of 1981.
   Sales of manufactured goods and other items in the non-farm
category were up by $3.67 billion to $77.61 billion, reflecting
strength in sales of industrial supplies, aircraft and consumer
goods.
   The rise in imports came entirely from an increase in petroleum
imports, which shot up 17.5 percent to $10.83 billion, with the
advance coming from the higher cost of oil.
   Non-petroleum imports declined by $1.23 billion to $105.30
billion, reflecting a drop in demand for consumer goods and autos.
   The improved trade performance put the quarterly deficit at the
lowest level since a $25.7 billion imbalance in the first quarter
of 1985.
   The deficit with the countries of Western Europe fell to $1.02
billion, the lowest level in almost six years. As usual, the
largest deficit was with Japan, an imbalance of $13.16 billion,
down 14.5 percent from the fourth quarter.

   A gasoline pipeline exploded and
killed three people just days after residents were assured it had
not been damaged by a runaway train that plowed through the same
neighborhood two weeks ago.
   ``It looks like a bomb went off over Duffy Street,'' City
Attorney James Penman said after the Thursday morning blast that
sent flames 300 feet skyward and produced heat so intense that pets
and corn stalks were singed two blocks away.
   Thirty-one people were injured in the explosion that also
destroyed 10 homes and 18 cars. About 300 people were ordered to
leave their homes for the night, and the pipeline break cut off Las
Vegas' chief source of gasoline and diesel fuel.
   Up to seven people were unaccounted-for after the blast, but by
midmorning today authorities said all but one had been located.
   ``It's like a nightmare,'' said Delores Jones, whose house was
destroyed by the fire. ``I haven't slept since the train wreck.
It's come back to haunt me.''
   The May 12 train wreck leveled a row of homes and killed four
people.
   National Transportation Safety Board personnel gathered here
today to investigate the explosion, and Calnev Pipeline Co. manager
Ken Seal said there was a ``very good possibility'' the company's
14-inch pipeline was damaged by the train accident.
   The city and an attorney for more than 100 residents announced
plans to file lawsuits against the Las Vegas company. The residents
also plan to sue the city and the rail line, Southern Pacific.
   ``We did not feel in the first place they should have started up
that railroad as quickly as they did. And we particularly tried to
get the pipeline shut down. Now look what happened,'' said
residents' attorney James H. Davis, who was hired after the train
wreck.
   The neighborhood was evacuated for several days after the train
jumped the track because of fears the pipeline might have been
weakened. The city was assured the line was safe when it reopened
several days ago, Penman said.
   The body of a woman killed in the blast was found in the back
yard of a home, pinned to a chain-link fence. The other two
fatalities, an adult and child, were found next door.
   ``A woman said she ran out of her house, she left behind her
sister, her cousin and a 6-month-old baby inside, and she looked
back, and the house blew up behind her,'' said Councilwoman Valerie
Pope-Ludlam.
   Just before the blast, a fountain of gasoline spouted above
ground, said Paul Allaire, a city information officer. ``It was up
in the air _ high pressure _ like a geyser,'' he said.
   The pipeline carries gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from a tank
farm in Colton, several miles from the blaze site, to southern
Nevada, supplying the Las Vegas Valley with 90 percent of its fuel.
   It was buried 6 feet deep near the spot where the train derailed.
   On the eve of the Memorial Day weekend, Las Vegas was left with
less than a week's supply of gasoline and only a couple of days
worth of diesel fuel. Gas was being trucked into the city, and spot
checks this morning showed no immediate signs of panic-buying by
motorists.
   P.J. Johnson, a worker at a Texaco station at a busy
intersection on Las Vegas' east side, said pumps were ``a little
busier, but there are no lines or anything like that. There's
really no big rush.''
   Once the explosion occurred, the flow of fuel through the
pipeline was shut off, said Jed Robinson, Calnev's general manager
in San Bernardino. But fuel remaining in the shattered pipe
continued to burn fiercely through much of the day. Robinson said
up to 12,000 gallons of gasoline burned.
   Residents have complained recently that train wheels throw off
sparks as they pass and that railroad crews have to walk alongside
afterward and douse small fires.
   A freight train passed over the tracks 10 minutes before the
explosion, said Southern Pacific spokesman Bob Taggart.
   There was no immediate evidence, however, that sparks from the
passing train triggered the blast.

<HEAD>Judge Grants Delay in Trial of Former CIA Agent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday moved back the
starting date of the Iran-Contra trial of a former CIA agent to
July 24.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton granted the two-week delay
after lawyers for Joseph Fernandez said the government's case has
been tainted with testimony given under immunity from prosecution.
   Fernandez, the CIA's former station chief in Costa Rica, is
accused of covering up his ties to Oliver North's secret Contra
resupply operation. The network operated during a congressional ban
on military aid to the Nicaraguan rebel force.
   Fernandez is accused of obstructing and making false statements
to the CIA's inspector general and the presidentially appointed
Tower Commission early in 1987.
   At a court hearing, Fernandez's lawyer Thomas Wilson said that
Cole Black of the CIA's inspector general office had informed the
prosecution that he had read Fernandez's immunized congressional
testimony detailing many of the activities for which he is now
accused of crimes.
   Black told the prosecution ``he would be unable to ferret out
immunized testimony from non-immunized testimony,'' Wilson said.
Black was interviewed for three hours by the office of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh and testified before a grand jury for two
hours.
   Prosecutor Robert Longstreth disputed Wilson's assertion, saying
Wilson had been able to come up with just a single example of
Black's testimony possibly being tainted.
   ``We think Black's testimony is clean,'' said Longstreth.
   Under a Supreme Court ruling, the government may not make any
use of a person's immunized testimony in building a case against
him.
   Another CIA employee, Louis Dupart, compliance officer for the
CIA's Central American Task Force, ``steeped himself in immunized
testimony,'' which he used to brief his superiors who also faced
questioning in the Iran-Contra affair, said Wilson.
   The lawyer said the government interviewed Dupart 12 times.
   Hilton said he might require the prosecution to demonstrate more
conclusively that its case wasn't tainted by immunized testimony.
   The judge set aside July 10 to hear any motions concerning the
use of classified information, the use of immunized testimony or
other matters.
   Hilton also directed the prosecution to turn over to Fernandez
for use in his defense a deposition of Lewis Tambs, a former U.S.
ambassador to Costa Rica.
   One of the charges is that Fernandez falsely told the CIA
inspector general that an airstrip in Costa Rica built by the North
network was initiated by the Costa Rican government.
   Prosecutor Laurence Shtasel said Tambs' deposition shows only
``why they (Costa Rican officials) agreed to it subsequently.''

<HEAD>Settlement Reached in Lawsuit Over Drowning on Dustin Hoffman's Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A settlement has been reached in a
lawsuit against Dustin Hoffman and three other defendants that
stemmed from the accidental drowning of a woman on the actor's
estate in 1986.
   Hoffman will pay nothing to the estate of Sheila Cruse Fionda
under the settlement reached Thursday.
   ``The amount will not be disclosed but the settlement does not
involve any money from Mr. Hoffman,'' said Superior Judge Walter M.
Pickett Jr. after attorneys presented him with the agreement less
than an hour before trial was to begin.
   The lawsuit, filed by Fionda's former husband on behalf of their
son, concerned claims of wrongful death and negligence in Fionda's
Aug. 24, 1986, drowning. Hoffman was not at the estate at the time.
   Fionda, 43, a teacher, was found floating face down about 6 a.m.
in the hot tub portion of a swimming pool on Hoffman's Roxbury
estate. An autopsy showed her blood-alcohol count was three times
the legal limit for drunken driving in Connecticut.
   Fionda had gone out to dinner with Hoffman's former caretaker,
Albion Dudley. A court document says Fionda was awake at 4 a.m. in
the caretaker's apartment and asked Dudley to go swimming. When he
declined, she went alone, the lawsuit said.
   In addition to Hoffman and Dudley, the lawsuit also named the
tub installer and the company that made the tub's heating element.
The lawsuit did not specify damages sought, but Fionda's attorney
said last year the family would settle for $200,000.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Veterans Affairs said Friday
that lack of funds is forcing it to curtail medical services.
   VA Secretary Edward Derwinski announced a freeze, except in
emergencies, on accepting new patients with non-service-connected
ailments whose incomes are above certain limits.
   Rep. G. V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House
Veterans Affairs Committee, said the new limit essentially would
exclude such veterans with incomes greater than $16,476.
   ``This is just sad, that the veteran again is caught in the
squeeze play of politics,'' said Thomas A. Sherwood, director for
health policy and planning at the Vietnam Veterans of America.
   ``There is no question that this will affect a large number of
veterans,'' said Cooper T. Holt, executive director of the
Washington office of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
   The VA also announced that vacant staff positions at VA
facilities will not be filled, the agency will stop spending for
the maintenance and purchase of certain equipment and the start-up
of several projects will be delayed.
   ``I must take these actions to keep the system functioning
within the limits of our resources,'' said Derwinski. He said the
cuts should allow the agency to contunue operating at a reduced
level until June 15.
   By then, he said, he hopes Congress will have resolved an
impasse that has prevented approval of a supplemental funding bill
for the department. If that does not occur, said Derwinski, more
drastic cuts may be needed.
   The House passed a supplemental appropriation bill last week
including $340 million to continue operations of VA health care
facilities through the remainder of the fiscal year.
   The Senate, however, passed a measure including money only
through June 15. The House balked at that limit and the dispute
remains unresolved.
   ``These folks just can't get together to do what is best for the
veterans that we are supposed to be serving,'' said Sherwood..
   ``Some vets have no choice but to rely on the VA'' for medical
care, he said.
   Montgomery said some alcohol and drug treatment service have
already been cut back and that nursing home and hospital beds will
have to be closed for lack of staff.

   A surgeon saved the life of a gunshot victim by
plugging the bullet holes in his heart with her fingers and
massaging the organ to keep it beating during a 14-minute
helicopter ride to a trauma center.
   Dr. Wendy Marshall cradled the exposed heart in her hands and
kept the patient from bleeding to death while she supervised his
transfer Thursday from a Joliet hospital to a suburban trauma
center equipped for open-heart surgery.
   Surgeons there repaired the holes, and the patient, Tommy Lee
``Tony'' Hairston, was doing well Friday, said Ms. Marshall,
director of Loyola University Medical Center's trauma unit and its
air medical service.
   ``We were lucky,'' she said in an interview from suburban
Maywood a day after the feat, which the hospital's chairman of
surgery, Dr. Robert J. Freeark, called unprecedented and heroic.
   ``It's one for the books, that's for sure,'' said Dr. John
Barrett, director of the area's busiest trauma unit at Cook County
Hospital.
   Ms. Marshall said the good judgment of surgeons at Silver Cross
Hospital in Joliet to call for help before it was too late, coupled
with the efficiency of her medical support staff, made the dramatic
transfer possible.
   ``It's a team effort,'' she said. ``That's the success of the
system.''
   The team was lucky because a major storm system cleared the area
just two hours before Ms. Marshall was summoned at 5 a.m. ``If the
storms had still been going on, we would not have been able to
fly,'' she said.
   She said the patient likely would not have survived transfer by
ambulance. Joliet is about 25 miles southwest of Maywood.
   Hairston, 29, a Joliet landscaper, was shot Wednesday night
after an argument with a neighbor over missing property, police
said. The neighbor, Robert Knox, was charged with attempted murder,
armed violence and unlawful use of a weapon, police said.
   Hairston was rushed to Silver Cross, where an operation was
performed. However, after surgery, he started bleeding again.
   A second operation revealed the bullet wounds in the heart,
which could not be repaired without a heart-bypass machine, which
Silver Cross lacks. Surgeons called for help and Ms. Marshall
arrived 23 minutes later.
   Freeark said it's not unusual for a trauma surgeon to use
fingers to block holes in the heart, but ``that usually takes place
in an emergency room, until you can get the patient to the
operating room.''
   ``To my knowledge, no one has ever transferred a patient by any
means _ ambulance or certainly helicopter _ from one hospital to
another while a surgeon had a finger occluding a hole in the
heart,'' Freeark said.
   He added that few surgeons would have thought to try the
transfer, and without it, ``no question the patient would have
died.''
   Adding to the difficulty was the fact that Hairston's heart
stopped beating three times, for a total of eight minutes, during
the trip, requiring Ms. Marshall to massage the organ between her
hands _ while keeping her fingers in the holes _ to stimulate it to
pump again.
   ``It would have been very easy to get discouraged with the whole
thing anywhere along the way,'' Freeark said. ``But that's Dr.
Marshall. She doesn't quit.''

   It took a college auditorium
to hold all the people who wanted to testify or sit in on a
presentence hearing for four teen-age vandals who damaged a high
school so badly it is still closed two months later.
   ``The first thing that crosses your mind is lock them up for 10
years,'' Dennis Thul, a high school parent testified at the
Thursday night hearing attended by more than 300 people. But after
reflecting, Thul said, ``What I would like to see is harsh
punishment in community service.''
   Other parents, along with teachers, classmates and taxpayers,
recommended community service, counseling, restitution, even some
jail time for that damage that ranges upwards of $6 million. But
none recommended extended prison sentences.
   One student handed in a petition he said was signed by 285
people urging that the four defendants not be sent to prison.
   ``I expected in some ways tonight to have a vigilante
atmosphere,'' said parent Aethan Hart, who expressed relief at what
he called a ``thoughtful process.''
   Many of the approximately 30 people who testified at Inver Hills
Community College expressed sympathy for the teen-agers' families
and pleaded with the judges to impose sentences that allow for
rehabilitation.
   But they also expressed anger and frustration over students'
projects that were destroyed and the disruption it caused.
   The 1,220-student Henry Sibley High School in the St. Paul
suburb of Mendota Heights has been closed since the March 23
damage. The vandals destroyed student projects and teaching
equipment and turned on fire hoses that soaked asbestos,
contaminating air in the building.
   Sibley students are attending another school during the repair
and cleanup.
   All four defendants, three of them 18 years old and one 17, have
pleaded guilty to felony first-degree criminal dmage to property,
third-degree burglary and theft. On June 12, Dakota County District
Judge Thomas Lacy is to sentence Jason Lasch and the juvenile,
while District Judge William Thuet is to sentence Edward Easton and
Matthew Klein.
   All four attended the presentence hearing, but said nothing.
Lasch was the only one who wasn't a student at Sibley at the time
of the vandalism and Klein was the only one unable to make his
$25,000 bail. He has been in jail since the end of March.
   State law requires the state Corrections Department to get from
crime victims a statement of the damage they suffered and their
opinions on sentencing. Because of the unusually large number of
victims in this case, the judges decided to hold the hearing in the
auditorium.
   Dakota County Attorney James Backstrom has said the case
justifies an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines, which
call for no more than a year in the county jail and 10 years of
probation for the 18-year-olds.
   The juvenile cannot be sentenced to community service or a
juvenile institution past his 19th birthday, which is 13 months
from now.

   The Energy Department conducted its
fifth nuclear weapons test of the year at the Nevada Test Site on
Friday, and it was deemed ``very successful.''
   Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer said the test was weapons
related and carried an explosive force of less than 20 kilotons.
All tests are listed as having an explosive yield of less than 20
kilotons, or 20 to 150 kilotons.
   A kiloton is equivalent to one thousand tons of TNT.
   ``The test was very successful,'' Boyer said. ``There were no
problems.''
   The test, code-named Tulia, was the 692nd announced shot since
testing began in Nevada in January 1951.
   The device was detonated at 11:07 a.m. in a shaft 1,300 feet
beneath the surface of Yucca Flat, about 80 miles northwest of Las
Vegas. The blast was not felt in Las Vegas.
   Boyer said there were no protesters at the site at the time of
detonation.

   An ailing peregrine falcon chick has
been taken from a nest on a 21st-floor ledge of a office building
for treatment.
   Thomas French, director of the state's endangered species
program, rappelled down 23-story Monarch Place on Thursday to
remove the hatchling, said Carol Bevan-Bogart, a spokeswoman for
Monarch Insurance Co.
   She said company officials contacted French after getting calls
from residents watching the nest on a local cable television
channel. The cable company has had a camera trained on the nest
around-the-clock.
   The chick, one of two that hatched on the ledge two weeks ago,
was taken to a veterinarian near Boston because it had trouble
breathing, she said.
   The chicks are the first peregrine falcons to hatch in western
Massachusetts in more than 40 years.
   Last week, French made his first descent of the building to
remove an egg that had not hatched in hopes that it could be
incubated. But the egg proved to be infertile.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose title of president was
largely ceremonial window dressing, now has new power and perhaps
new accountability to go with his old title.
   Gorbachev assumed a more powerful presidency on Thursday after
winning more than 95 percent of the votes from the new Congress of
People's Deputies. The new position replaces the largely ceremonial
presidency he held previously as the Soviet Union's official head
of state.
   The new presidency entitles Gorbachev to serve as head of the
nation's supreme military body, the Defense Council; to negotiate
and sign treaties; and to draft decrees and orders.
   However, constitutional amendments passed in November mean that
the new president will be subject _ on paper at least _ to control
by a new, full-time legislature, the Supreme Soviet.
   That new body, composed of 542 people chosen from the 2,250-seat
Congress, will have extensive powers to oversee Soviet economic,
financial, social, foreign affairs and defense policy.
   A bicameral body that is intended to hold two annual sessions of
about four months each, the Supreme Soviet also will be empowered
to schedule nationwide elections, appoint the premier, elect the
top national court and endorse senior prosecutors.
   After heated debate in the old Soviet parliament last fall,
Gorbachev agreed that the Supreme Soviet also would have the right
to repeal presidential decrees.
   Gorbachev, as Communist Party chief, holds ultimate power. But
as president, he can be recalled by the congress, which will elect
presidents once every five years. There is a two-term limit on one
person holding the office.
   Many of the powers now vested in the president, the Supreme
Soviet and the directly elected congress rested formally in the
past with the parliament and the chairman of its executive
Presidium, who came to be known as the president.
   In practice, however, as writer Chingiz Aitmatov noted in a
speech nominating Gorbachev for the new presidency on Thursday, the
Supreme Soviet parliament was ``under strong pressure from
authoritarian regimes'' and legislators passed laws in ritual votes
``as if in a theater.''
   For decades, real power rested with the head of the ruling
Communist Party, and his fellow members of the top party body, the
Politburo. The old-style presidency acquired prominence only with
the ascent of Leonid I. Brezhnev, who held the ceremonial post from
1960 to June 1964.
   Months later, Brezhnev was chosen as the compromise candidate of
rival Politburo factions battling to oust Nikita S. Khrushchev from
the Kremlin.
   Brezhnev did not resume the ceremonial title of president again
until June 1977, following the ouster of Nikolai V. Podgorny from
the post. After Brezhnev's death in June 1982, his successor as
party chief, Yuri V. Andropov, assumed the post, as did Konstantin
U. Chernenko after him.
   Gorbachev, named Communist Party leader in March 1985, at first
put veteran Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko into the presidency
in the summer of 1985, and took the post himself only in October
when Gromyko retired from politics.
   The ceremonial nature of the past presidency led congress deputy
Konstantin D. Lubenchenko to proclaim Thursday during debate on
Gorbachev's candidacy that ``we don't have a president of the
country'' and are only just beginning to create one.
   Several speakers in Thursday's debate, mindful of past
autocracy, expressed doubts about uniting the powers of Soviet
president and Communist Party chief in one man.
   Gorbachev pledged not to repeat the abuses of the past. But it
will be up to the new parliament to hold him to his promise.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Refuses to Indict Mother for Manslaughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A grand jury refused to indict a young
mother for manslaughter in the prenatal, cocaine-linked death of
her 2-day-old daughter, authorities said Friday.
   The case of Melanie Green, 24, sparked heated debate over the
merits of such prosecution after Winnebago County State's Attorney
Paul Logli charged her May 9 with involuntary manslaughter and
delivery during pregancy of a controlled substance to a minor.
   The move drew fire from some members of the medical, social
service and legal communities, who argued fear of prosecution could
prevent drug-abusing mothers-to-be from seeking medical help.
   ``This office brought the charges and sought the indictment
because we believed at that time and still do believe that it was
an appropriate response to the death of a newborn child,'' Logli
said Friday at a news conference.
   ``There are no winners in a case like this,'' said Winnebago
County Public Defender Gary Pumilia, who accompanied Ms. Green to
Thursday's grand jury proceeding.
   ``A case like this gets a lot of publicity, but the battle in
the trenches is being fought in juvenile court,'' in child-abuse
and custody cases involving suspected prenatal drug abuse, he said.
   Ms. Green's daughter, Bianca, was 2 days old when she died Feb.
4 of oxygen deprivation attributed to her mother's alleged cocaine
use during pregnancy. Prenatal exposure to the drug can cause
numerous health problems, including low birth weight, impaired
motor ability, irritability that can hinder learning, strokes and
seizures.
   Ms. Green, who does not have a telephone, could not be reached
immediately for comment on the grand jury action.
   She had said earlier, ``I loved her, I did.'' She refused to
discuss her alleged drug use, but said authorities ``should help
people. I tried to get help but I couldn't get any.''
   Logli called for state legislation ``to address the very
pressing issues brought on by this prosecution,'' citing the need
to protect infants, eliminate drug abuse among pregnant women and
provide for criminal prosecution in the event of injury.
   While charges related to the baby's death have been dropped,
prosecutors have not decided whether to pursue drug-abuse charges
against Ms. Green, Logli said, adding he also was concerned about
the welfare of her son, a first-grader.
   Attorney Colleen Connell of the American Civil Liberties Union,
which was representing Ms. Green, had said most drug rehabilitation
programs will not accept pregnant women.
   Cocaine was found in Bianca's system and in her mother's, Dr. P.
John Seward, the county coroner, said. The drug was carried through
the placenta to the fetus, reducing Bianca's ability to accept
oxygen from the mother and resulting in brain damage.
   Logli had characterized that process as delivery of a controlled
substance to a minor.

<HEAD>Arabs Agree on Six-Month Plan for Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONA ZIADE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arab League summit closed two
days late Friday after adopting what Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz called a ``gentleman's agreement'' for Syria to withdraw its
troops from Lebanon.
   Syrian intransigence prevented any resolution explicitly calling
for the Syrian army to leave Lebanon, the main Iraqi objective.
Several times the Syrian-Iraqi confrontation almost led to the
collapse of the summit.
   The Arab leaders appointed a three-member committee and gave it
six months to supervise a cease-fire, reconvene Lebanon's
Parliament, arrange the appointment of a president and amend the
constitution for more balanced power-sharing between the warring
Moslems and Christians.
   The negotiators are Morocco's King Hassan II, King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia and Algeria's President Chadli Bendjedid.
   In Beirut, surprising support for the peace plan came from
acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, the Moslem leader whose closest
ally is Syria.
   ``I welcome the resolutions of the Arab summit and hope they
will be implemented as soon as possible,'' Hoss said in a brief
statement.
   His Christian opponent, Gen. Michel Aoun, will not comment until
after an emergency meeting Saturday of his rival Cabinet, Aoun's
spokesman said.
   But the Christian Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. said the summit
``failed to offer anything more than lip service to help resolve
the Lebanon crisis.''
   ``The summit also has failed to devise a mechanism to monitor a
cease-fire and made no reference to the role of the Syrian army in
Lebanon,'' it said.
   Aoun has insisted on a Syrian pullout as a precondition for a
Moslem-Christian dialogue on political reforms to end the 14-year
civil war.
   In Casablanca, the war of words between arch foes Syria and Iraq
caused chaotic scenes and almost led the summit to collapse.
   As a result, the meeting continued for four days, longer than
any summit in the Arab League's 44-year history, Moroccan
television said.
   Iraq's Aziz told reporters that if Syria does not withdraw
within six months, his government will demand another summit.
   The conference resolution ``fell short of what must be done on
this important issue,'' Aziz said. But he added the leaders reached
``a gentleman's agreement for a pullout of Syrian troops,'' first
from Beirut then from other regions.
   Syria has 40,000 troops in Moslem west Beirut and Lebanon's
eastern and northern provinces under a 1976 league peacekeeping
mandate.
   Secretary-General Chedli Klibi read the final communique closing
the summit, called primarily to reinstate Egypt in the 22-nation
league after a 10-year suspension for making peace with Israel.
Delegates provided the text of other resolutions.
   The summit adopted a seven-point plan on Lebanon that stressed
the country's unity, Arab identity, territorial integrity and
independence. It asserted the fate of Lebanon is a ``general Arab
responsibility,'' and called on all Lebanese factions to respect
the much-fractured cease-fire called by the Arab League last April.
   King Hassan's committee was asked:
   _To invite Lebanese legislators to a conference to prepare a
political reform document that would form the basis for national
reconciliation.
   _To get Parliament to ratify the document.
   _To arrange for Parliament to elect a president who would form a
``government of national reconciliation'' that would amend the
constitution. A new constitution likely would reflect the wishes of
Lebanon's Moslem majority, shrinking the power of the minority
Christians who traditionally have dominated Lebanese politics.
   _To support the government in exercising full sovereignty over
all Lebanese territory.
   The last refers not only to Syrian troops, but also about 2,000
Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Lebanon at Syria's invitation and
about 1,000 Israeli troops that patrol the self-designated security
zone Israel carved out of southern Lebanon after its 1982-85
invasion.
   The summit communique condemned ``continued Israeli aggression
against Lebanon and its sovereignty.''
   Arab leaders agreed to pay a $120 million lump sum and provide
monthly payments of $43 million promised last year to support the
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories. The
Palestine Liberation Organization complained to the meeting that
only Libya and Saudi Arabia had paid up.
   It supported PLO opposition to an Israeli proposal for elections
on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip of Palestinians who would
negotiate with Israel for limited self-rule.
   The summit backed PLO demands that elections be held under
international supervision ``within the framework of a comprehensive
peace process, since the Israeli scheme aims at undermining the
uprising and sidestepping the PLO and the Palestinian people's
inalienable national rights.''

<TEXT>
   The Singer Company has been barred from
selling any of its assets or paying stock dividends pending a
lawsuit over claims a former subsidiary defrauded the government.
   The company, named as a co-defendant in a civil suit against its
former Link Flight Simulation Division, was also ordered not to
incur any new debt or make any payments to investor Paul Bilzerian,
the Florida financier who acquired the company last year.
   The preliminary injunction, issued by a federal judge in
Baltimore, was sought by the Justice Department, which last March
joined the $231 million lawsuit that had originally been filed by a
former Link Flight pricing administrator.
   The complaint charges that the company cheated the Defense
Department out of $77 million by submitting false contract bid data
on flight simulation equipment to train pilots. It seeks triple
damages from Link Flight, which is now owned by CAE Industries Ltd.
of Toronto.
   Singer is named as a defendant in the False Claims Act suit
along with the Canadian company.
   In a brief order signed Thursday, U.S. District Judge Herbert F.
Murray said he granted the injunction because ``the continued
reduction of the assets of Singer Company could cause irreparable
harm to the ability of the United States to collect a judgment'' if
it wins the lawsuit.
   There was no immediate comment from the company, which has
headquarters in Tampa, Fla. But attorneys for Singer indicated they
planned to appeal Murray's decision by seeking a stay pending an
appeal. Murray has not ruled on the request.

<HEAD>FAA Denies Exception For Mandatory Pilot Retirement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration denied
Friday a petition from a group of older pilots to be allowed to fly
airliners after age 60, saying older pilots are more likely to be
involved in accidents.
   The agency announced, however, that it would fund a detailed
study of pilot age and accident rates and indicated it might be
willing to certify individual pilots over 60 if a way can be found
to determine their capacities.
   ``What is needed and what the petitioners have failed to show,''
the FAA said, ``is a way to discriminate between those who
contribute to the adverse trend of increasing accidents (involving
older pilots) and those who do not.''
   The FAA said it is willing to look at any scientific evidence
that will help in setting criteria for selecting older pilots who
have a low accident risk.
   The issue has simmered since the 1950s when the FAA first
ordered that airline pilots and co-pilots must retire at 60. It
attracted renewed interest after Feb. 24 when 59-year-old United
Airlines pilot David Cronin guided a Boeing 747 to a safe landing
in Honolulu after a section of its fuselage blew off, sending nine
passengers to their deaths.
   Cronin was hailed as a hero for his second-to-last commercial
flight before retirement. Pilots have for years been saying the FAA
rule needlessly discriminates on the bases of age.
   The latest denial came in a petition for exemption from the
retirement rule filed by a group of pilots in May 1986. The FAA
rejected it 16 months later. The pilots then went to court, and the
U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago required the FAA to take another
look at the petition.
   ``The FAA has long contended that pilots past the age of 60 are
more likely to suffer performance degradation and that there is no
way to accurately predict its onset,'' the FAA said. It said there
is evidence that older pilots' skills deteriorate and statistics
that show they are more likely to be involved in accidents.
   The agency noted that older pilots contend that their experience
in the cockpit makes up for any problem associated with being over
60. But it said the evidence shows otherwise.

<HEAD>Seabrook Operators Prepare for First Atomic Reaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 13 years of protests and wrangling,
Seabrook nuclear power plant officials got their testing license
Friday and began laying plans to start their first atomic chain
reaction, possibly within a week.
   The license, the biggest milestone yet for a project that is 10
years late and billions over budget, was granted by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission Friday morning. A federal appeals court
declined to delay the tests late Thursday.
   The license does not settle disputes over evacuation planning
for crowded beaches and coastal communities within 10 miles of
Seabrook _ the key issue blocking commercial operation of the $6
billion reactor.
   Seabrook officials hope to receive a commercial license in the
fall, but Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and other plant foes
promise to keep fighting _ to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.
   But ``the fact is the low-power license means that all the
technical issues have been resolved, and that's a very critical
step,'' said the plant's top executive, Edward Brown.
   Relief was palpable among officials at a project that has faced
countless licensing and financial setbacks and years of
high-visibility demonstrations.
   Inside the Seabrook gates, a sign on the road leading to the
power plant and posters inside the administration building
proclaimed: ``License Received! A time for pride. A time for
power.''
   Beaming plant executives congratulated each other as they read
copies of the freshly issued license.
   Before starting the testing, plant operators planned to spend a
day or so reviewing voluminous technical specifications attached to
the license. Joseph Grillo, the plant's operations manager, said he
expected no surprises.
   ``We know pretty much what's coming,'' Grillo said. ``We haven't
been doing this in a vacuum. We've been negotiating'' with the NRC
staff on technical issues.
   The testing process likely will start this weekend, plant
officials said. Valves will be opened and water will be pumped
through the reactor coolant system. Friction from the rapid
circulation would heat the reactor from 150 degrees to its
operating temperature of 557 degrees.
   After a five-day warmup, operators would set the stage for a
nuclear chain reaction by withdrawing neutron-absorbing control
rods from the reactor fuel core and reducing the amount of
neutron-absorbing boron in the coolant water, eventually letting
uranium atoms start fissioning.
   Brown estimated the plant would achieve initial ``criticality''
_ its first self-sustained fission reaction _ within seven to 10
days.
   That could coincide with a rally and mass civil disobedience
action planned months ago for next weekend by the Clamshell
Alliance, which for 13 years has organized protests that have
resulted in nearly 2,500 arrests and in the name Seabrook becoming
synonymous with anti-nuclear activism.
   ``Will we modify our schedule to tie into what the demonstrators
are doing at any point in time?'' Brown said. ``The answer is no.''
   Clamshell organizers, vowing non-violence, say protesters plan
to try to climb fences surrounding the site but won't try to reach
an inner fence around the plant itself.
   Seabrook's opponents argue that stopping the plant is crucial
for the health and safety of tens of thousands of people who live
nearby or crowd seacoast beaches as close as 1.7 miles from the
reactor.
   Brown, president of Seabrook operator New Hampshire Yankee,
maintains that Seabrook is ``the safest power plant that's ever
been built'' and that evacuation plans for surrounding communities
would protect the public in the unlikely event of an accident.
Federal licensing board hearings on the plans are in progress.
   Seabrook supporters say the 1,150-megawatt reactor is vitally
needed to meet New England's burgeoning power demand.
   Nuclear industry officials worldwide also see Seabrook as
crucial to their hopes of fostering development of a new generation
of reactors, Brown acknowledged.
   ``We're aware the rest of the industry is watching us, but we're
not out there fighting the industry's battles,'' he said.
   Seabrook officials had fought nearly three years for the
low-power license after the plant was completed in July, 1986.

<HEAD>Supplemental Housing Allowance Readjusted by Pentagon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon announced Friday that it has
readjusted a key supplemental housing allowance and more than
800,000 people in the military services will see a small increase
in that part of their paycheck.
   The change in the variable housing allowance, set to begin June
1, will be the second increase this year.
   The Pentagon declined to estimate the average increase on a
percentage basis, saying all the geographic factors hadn't been
computed.
   But figures released by the Defense Department suggest the
increase will exceed this year's first hike of 3.4 percent, and
will range from an average $4.80 a month extra for a private to
$13.01 a month extra for a colonel.
   Military officials boosted the allowance in January,
deliberately holding down the size of that hike to make sure the
Pentagon didn't exceed a congressional limit of $1.22 billion for
the entire program.
   ``The VHA rate increase, effective June 1, is designed to
increase the amount that servicemembers receive and reduce the
out-of-pocket housing costs, while remaining below the ceiling,''
the Pentagon said in a statement.
   All men and women in the military who are not required to live
in government quarters receive a basic housing allowance each
month. Since 1981, those men and women assigned to bases in
high-cost parts of the country have also received a variable
housing allowance.
   Congress authorized the supplemental allowance with the goal of
standardizing the housing purchasing power of those in the military
regardless of where they are located.
   The payments can range from a few dollars a month to more than
$300 a month depending upon the area, rank of the individual and
whether there are dependents. In some special cases, such as in
Alaska, the payment can exceed $500 a month.
   Currently, about 815,000 of the nation's 2.1 million active-duty
people in the service are receiving a monthly variable housing
assistance payment.
   The Pentagon has requested a 3.6 percent increase in the payment
in the fiscal 1990 budget, which is now undergoing congressional
review.

   An American diplomat was stabbed to death in her
ground-floor west London apartment, police said Friday.
   Scotland Yard said the body of Marie Burke, 63, a second
secretary who worked in the consular section of the U.S. Embassy,
was found Thursday afternoon after a colleague became concerned
when she failed to show up for work.
   She last seen about 10 p.m. Wednesday, heading home after dining
with friends, police said.
   Police said they found Mrs. Burke in bed, still in her
nightclothes, with what appeared to be a single stab wound in the
chest.
   Detective Superintendent Alan Lewis, leading the investigation,
said: ``There is no sign of forced entry, and it appears the
assailant may have got in through an insecure or open window.''
   Officers said her purse was missing but embassy-owned art
objects were left undisturbed. Scotland Yard said she did not
appear to have been sexually assaulted.
   A Yard spokesman, speaking anonymously, said the slaying was not
believed to have a political motive or diplomatic connection.
   Neither Scotland Yard nor the U.S. Embassy knew Mrs. Burke's
hometown, although the embassy said she was from New York state.
   Mrs. Burke, who was widowed in 1974, is survived by two
daughters and a son, police said. She had worked in the U.S.
Consular Service since the late 1970s and had been posted in London
for the last 18 months.
   A statement issued by U.S. Ambassador Henry E. Catto and the
embassy staff said: ``Marie Burke was a valued and beloved
colleague. We share the grief of her family and our prayers are
with them. We extend to them our heartfelt condolences.''

   Jewish settlers shot up a West Bank village
Friday in the second vigilante raid in two days, wounding at least
three people and damaging houses and cars, residents and Israel
radio said.
   The radio reported another raid Friday evening, but gave no
details.
   Fifteen armed settlers conducted a patrol Friday in Hebron,
where the first vigilante raid occurred the night before, breaking
into several houses. Five paratroopers who escorted them did not
interfere, but fired into the air with the settlers when
Palestinians threw stones.
   A Labor Party minister in the coalition government claimed the
vigilantism among the 70,000 Jewish settlers in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip was intended to block Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's plan for Palestinian elections.
   A dissident Cabinet minister from Shamir's conservative Likud
bloc announced opposition to the proposal, and Trade Minister Ariel
Sharon, the leading Likud opponent, toured the West Bank to show
support for the settlers.
   Shamir, returning from a trip abroad, would not answer questions
about settler raids and said only: ``I don't think we are facing a
very serious situation. If it's necessary to do something, we shall
do it.''
   Soldiers dispersed a march by about 500 Arabs in the Dheisheh
refugee camp near Bethlehem with gunfire, wounding seven people.
   The protesters, most wearing masks, raised outlawed Palestinian
flags and shouted slogans through portable loudspeakers. The march
commemorated three Palestinians killed by soldiers last month.
   Arab hospital officials in east Jerusalem and Bethlehem said a
15-year-old girl was hospitalized with a stomach wound, another
young woman had leg wounds and five people were treated and
released.
   Residents of Arura, a village of 1,400 Palestinians about 20
miles north of Jerusalem, said 20 to 40 settlers invaded it from
surrounding hills at 9 a.m. Mahmoud Salah, a teacher, told The
Associated Press they started shooting at houses and people in the
streets.
   ``We are sure they were settlers,'' he said. ``They were dressed
in civilian clothes and did not act like security agents, because
they fired indiscriminately.''
   He said men, women and children rushed out and began pelted the
attackers with stones. Salah said the settlers left after three
hours.
   The daughter of village leader Yusef Mahmoud, who would not give
her first name, said the invaders smashed two cars and punctured
the windows of five houses with bullets.
   Villagers said five people were wounded, but Israel radio and
officials at nearby Ramallah Hospital reported only three
casualties, including 19-year-old Suleiman Abu Kandil with a
serious stomach wound.
   Mahmound, the village leader, said soldiers arrived soon after
the settlers left, in turn clashing with stone-throwing
Palestinians. He said one man was detained.
   ``We did not see Jewish settlers there but the residents claim
settlers attacked them,'' an army spokesman said. ``We are checking
it.''
   Israel radio said settlers from Oranim and Shaarei Tikva in the
West Bank raided nearby Arab villages Friday evening, saying they
wanted to avenge a firebomb attack on an Israeli car. The radio
said there were no casualties.
   On Thursday night, hundreds of settlers from Kiryat Arba in the
West Bank fired into Arab homes on the outskirts of neighboring
Hebron. Palestinians said there were no casualties but windows of
at least six houses were smashed.
   Aharon Domb of the Hebron Information Center run by the settlers
said the raid was a response to firebomb attacks on two
Israeli-owned cars Thursday, which caused no injuries.
   ``Since the politicians are not applying the law ... Kiryat Arba
residents were forced to respond to the Arab rioters,'' he said on
Israel radio. ``They did this, in part, by firing straight into
buildings.''
   Health Minister Yaacov Tsur of Labor blamed the rise in settler
violence on ``the settlement leaders' clear desire to torpedo the
peace move, the chance to reach elections and a dialogue with
Palestinians.''
   Under Shamir's plan, backed by Labor and approved earlier this
month by a Cabinet vote of 20-6, autonomy for 1.7 million
Palestinians in the occupied lands would be negotiated with
representatives arrested by them.
   Palestinians criticize the plan for not committing Israel to
withdraw from the territories, where an uprising began nearly 18
months ago. At least 498 Palestinains have been killed and 22
Israelis also have been slain.
   Right-wing politicians and settlers see the Shamir proposal as a
step toward a Palestinian state, which they consider a threat to
Israel's existence.
   Rebels in the conservative bloc have demanded a meeting of the
2,600-member Likud central committee to defeat or amend the plan,
and have the support of the three most powerful figures after the
prime minister: Sharon, Housing Minister David Levy and Economy
Minister Yitzhak Modai.
   Levy announced in newspaper interviews Friday he would voter
against the plan at the party meeting, tentatively set for next
month.
   Sharon insists the uprising end before any elections are held.

<HEAD>USDA Says Sales to Soviets Help Push Farm Exports to Seven-Year High</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Huge grain sales to the Soviet Union, part of
it wheat subsidized by the American taxpayer, are helping push U.S.
agricultural exports to a seven-year high of $39 billion, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The new export forecast was up $1 billion from the previous
projection made in February. The near-record $39 billion would be
for the fiscal year that will end on Sept. 30. Only 1981 and 1982
would be greater.
   ``If realized, export value would be the highest since fiscal
1982,'' the report said. ``Prospective larger coarse grain sales to
the Soviet Union (mainly corn) account for much of the increase.
U.S. grain sales to the Soviets are now expected to reach a record
high.''
   But the report added that ``an improved outlook for cotton and
livestock'' products also have contributed to the upward revision
in the export total.
   Although total U.S. agricultural export values are up sharply
from a decade low of $26.3 billion just three years ago, they still
are below the record sales of $43.8 billion in the 1981 fiscal
year, when actual quantities totaled more than 160 million tons.
Exports dropped to $39.1 billion and 157.9 million tons in 1982.
   The report said the 1989 tonnage will decline to 146.5 million
tons from 148.3 million last year. But higher prices will more than
offset the smaller quantity and boost the total value.
   Christopher E. Goldthwait, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said in a related
announcement that the Soviet Union has bought an additional 300,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat under a new line of subsidies approved by
President Bush earlier in the month.
   Under pressure from wheat area lawmakers, Bush on May 2 approved
a new subsidy line for Moscow of 1.5 million tons, about half of
what had been sought. The Soviets had been buying subsidized wheat
in the past but the authorization had run out.
   Moscow has 910,200 tons of wheat still available under the May 2
subsidy announcement, Goldthwait said.
   He said the latest sales by seven exporting companies call for
shipment in the first half of June. The subsidies average $8.89 per
ton, or about 24 cents per bushel of wheat. The total for the
300,000 tons would be about $2.7 million.
   The Soviet Union had bought more than 4 million tons of U.S.
wheat for 1988-89 delivery at prices subsidized under the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   The latest sales pushed total corn and wheat sales to the Soviet
Union for delivery this year under terms of the long-term supply
agreement between the two countries to a record of more than 20
million tons, surpassing the old mark of 18.6 million tons shipped
to the Soviets in 1984-85.
   Corn, which is not subsidized, makes up more than 15.6 million
tons of the current total, with wheat at 4.6 million tons. In
addition, the Soviets have bought 443,000 tons of soybeans, 1.37
million tons of soybean meal, and 807,400 tons of grain sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 300,000 tons of
wheat would be about 11 million bushels.
   Wheat prices have been averaging about $4 per bushel at the farm
level, according to the latest USDA five-day average, meaning that
the latest sale could have a farm value of around $44 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Goldthwait said the new subsidized wheat sales were handled by
Continental Grain Co., 95,000 tons; Garnac Grain Co., 20,000;
Peavey Co., 60,000; Harvest States Cooperatives, 25,000; Tradigrain
Inc., 50,000; Louis Dreyfus Corp., 25,000; and Bunge Corp., 25,000.

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Air Force on Friday delayed the
liftoff of a military navigation satellite because electrical
repairs at the launch pad will take longer than officials expected.
   June 5 is the earliest the $65 million Navstar Global
Positioning Satellite can be launched atop its Delta 2 rocket
booster, said Capt. Ken Warren, an Air Force spokesman.
   It will be the fifth launch attempt. The Delta 2-Navstar was to
have flown May 20, but bad weather forced three postponements. A
fourth launch attempt was aborted Wednesday because of a wiring
problem at the launch pad.
   Officials had predicted the circuit would be repaired in time
for a launch May 31, but technicians working at the pad on Friday
found several aging electrical components that need to be replaced.
   ``The components were due to expire soon, so rather than risk a
problem with them later, they decided to change them out,'' Warren
explained.
   Wednesday's scheduled launch was aborted at the last second when
a computer shut down the Delta 2's main engine before it could
fire. Experts investigating the incident discovered an electrical
problem that blocked the path of an ignition command sent by launch
controllers to an engine valve. The valve did not open and starved
the engine of fuel.

<TEXT>
   More than 160 ethnic Turks deported from
Bulgaria arrived in Turkey on Friday and said at least 30 people
have died in recent clashes between Turks and security forces in
Bulgaria.
   The deportees said growing resistance to an assimilation
campaign in Bulgaria led to the violence. The campaign includes
forcing ethnic Turks to change their Moslem names to Slavic ones.
   ``At least 30 are dead, 200 seriously injured and about 2,000
have been arrested,'' said Tahsin Haliloglu, one of 167 deported
ethnic Turks who arrived in Ankara. Officials said 90 other
deportees will arrive soon.
   Haliloglu said he was an organizer of the weekend demonstrations.
   ``We want our names back, education in Turkish in schools and
the right to carry on our traditions and our religious worship
which are all forbidden now,'' said Ali Ormanli, another deportee.
   Ormanli had been participating in a hunger strike in Bulgaria.
He said such strikes were spreading across Bulgaria.
   Ormanli said he was sent to a concentration camp in 1985 and
stayed there for two years and 10 months. After his release, he
said he was exiled to another part of Bulgaria. He said he was
deported May 9 without seeing his family.
   ``All this was because I refused to change my name,'' Ormanli
said in an interview at the airport.
   About 300 people from emigre communities in Turkey greeted the
deportees. There were tearful reunions as some people found family
members.
   Premier Turgut Ozal also went to the airport and said Turkey
will ask all countries that signed a Helsinki agreement on human
rights in January to pressure Bulgaria to change its policies on
its 900,000 ethnic Turks.
   After the start of the campaign, Turkey asked Bulgaria for
negotiations and said it was willing to accept the entire Turkish
minority.

<TEXT>
   Police questioned witnesses Friday who
saw a yellow vehicle speed away after two young American
missionaries were cut down by machine-gun fire. A guerrilla group
has claimed responsibility.
   The bodies of Todd Ray Wilson and Jeffrey Brent Ball, both
20-year-old Mormons from Utah, were taken to the La Paz airport for
return to the United States. Wilson's hometown was Wellington and
Ball was from Coalville.
   They were killed as they returned home Wednesday night.
   A statement distributed to La Paz newspapers claimed
responsibility on behalf of the Zarate Willka Armed Liberation
Front.
   It said, in part: ``The violation of our sovereignty cannot go
unpunished. The Yankee invaders who come to massacre our fellow
farmers are warned, as are their local slaves. We the poor have no
other road than to rise up in arms. Our hatred is implacable and
our war is to the death.''
   Zarate Willka was a 19th century Indian revolutionary in Bolivia.
   The group using his name also claimed responsibility for a bomb
that exploded in August near a motorcade carrying George P. Shultz,
then secretary of state. Several vehicles were damaged but no
injuries were reported.
   Interior Minister Eduardo Perez Beltran said the group ``does
not have a political affilitation and one cannot therefore speak of
the existence of guerillas in the country. We are facing something
that could also come from ... the cocaine trade.''
   U.S. Embassy officials, who are cooperating in the
investigation, say the responsibility is not yet clear.
   The two missionaries of the Church of Latter Day Saints lived
near a Mormon church that was seriously damaged by a bomb in 1988.
They arrived a year ago and were working in the Villa Victoria
neighborhood near downtown La Paz.
   About 400 Mormon missionaries are assigned to Bolivia, church
officials said.
   American officials said security had been strengthened for the
embassy and its personnel. They said it this was the first case of
U.S. citizens being killed by a terrorist or guerrilla group in
Bolivia.

   The Bush administration is considering a
policy change that could halve the admissions of Soviet refugees to
the United States, a Jewish community official said Friday.
   The proposed limitation is one of several options under review
in an attempt to cope with an unprecedented flow of Soviets, most
of them Jews, being allowed to leave under the glasnost policies of
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   If implemented, the new policy could be a boon for Israel which
accepts every Soviet Jew who can get out. In recent years, about 90
percent of Soviet Jews have opted to come to the United States
rather than Israel, said David Harris of the American Jewish
Committee.
   Israel, facing a slump in Jewish immigration and a surge in the
birthrate among its Arab minority, has been pushing for years to
get more Soviet Jews.
   The State Department had no immediate comment on the matter,
saying only that various options were under review for dealing with
the influx of Soviet emigres.
   Jewish groups and the Justice Department estimate that as many
as 75,000 Soviets will be granted exit visas this year, about
55,000 of them Jews and the rest Pentecostalists and Armenians.
   About 18,000 Soviets have left the Soviet Union so far this
year, and another 26,000 applicants are waiting to be interviewed
at the U.S. Embassy. The vast majority of Soviet emigres are
awarded refugee status by the United States, which means their way
here and resettlement is paid by the government.
   Next year the numbers are expected to increase further,
presenting the budget-strapped administration with a severe problem.
   The Bush administration, which only budgeted for some 22,500
Soviet refugees for fiscal 1989, has asked Congress to fund an
additional 22,500 Soviet refugees this fiscal year. The White House
has also asked for an emergency allocation of $100 million to deal
with the influx.
   In addition, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has proposed
legislation that would allow 30,000 admissions of Soviets annually,
although not as refugees. Other categories of admissions, such as
immigrants, are not eligible for full federal funding.
   Under the proposed change, Soviet applicants would no longer be
eligible for refugee status unless they have relatives in the
United States or a close affiliation with the United States through
education or other ties, said Harris, whose organization lobbies
for Soviet Jews.
   Existing policy allows admission of Soviets as refugees under a
category of ``national interest,'' in other words because U.S.
foreign policy interests seek to encourage the Kremlin to allow
freer emigration.
   Removing Soviets from that eligibility would bring their
treatment in line with that of other refugee groups, like Hispanics
and Asians, Harris said.
   An attempt to curb the number of Soviet refugees through a
policy directive from former attorney general Edwin Meese last
summer failed when U.S. lawmakers and Jewish groups protested.
   Meese directed that Soviet Jews would no longer be automatically
granted refugee status on an assumption that they all suffered
religious persecution, and instead would be dealt with on a
case-by-case basis.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service began implementing
the change and as many as 70 percent of refugee applicants were
rejected. But as a result of pressure from Congress, refugee
acceptance has gone up to about 80 percent for Soviet Jews, Harris
said.

   Here is a transcript of remarks by President Bush
and Italy's Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita as Bush arrived Friday
en route to a summit with NATO leaders.
   De Mita (through translator): Mr. President, I extend to you,
also on behalf of the Italian people, my most sincere and warm
welcome.
   We particularly appreciate your visit at the beginning of a
challenging mission in Europe.
   In this visit, we perceive the token of that special and
deep-rooted relationship binding the United States and Italy
through a sincere friendship and a strong alliance.
   Furthermore, Mr. President, Italy is aware of your personal
commitment to the search for peace, and for the defense of human
rights throughout the world.
   This commitment lives up to the best and highest U.S. tradition
and makes you a particularly welcome guest for the entire Italian
people.
   You arrive in a Europe where the winds of change are blowing.
   The outstanding events occurring in Eastern Europe countries and
the achievements of ``Community Europe'' have generated elements of
movement which open new prospects.
   It is up to us to grasp their meaning and channel them for the
best for our peoples and for peace.
   Time has come to view these changes with courage, without
relinquishing the vigorous loyalty to the ideals upon which our
free societies are founded.
   As times are changing, the solidarity between Europe and the
United States, between Italy and the United States, based on a
thorough sharing of values remains a cornerstone and a prerequisite
for facing these very changes.
   I am convinced that your visit will contribute to strengthen our
friendship, and it is in this spirit that I have the pleasure of
welcoming you to Italy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Bush: Well, let me begin by thanking all of you and my personal
friend, my good friend, Prime Minister De Mita, for welcoming us to
Italy at this late hour.
   Since ancient times, the saying goes, ``All roads lead to
Rome,'' and that's still true.
   And it is very fitting that here I begin my first step on this
first trip to Europe as president of the United States.
   Italy has long been a wellspring of Western culture and Western
values, fostering the alliance in a more unified Europe.
   I hope that our visit to Rome will demonstrate just how strongly
the United States respects and appreciates Italy's role as a
staunch ally and as a constant friend.
   When our calm and security has been threatened, you have been
ready to strengthen the alliance.
   And when Europe appeared ready to loosen the ties that sustained
it, you've kept those important trans-Atlantic ties alive and
strong.
   And when conflict has threatened, you have been in the front
ranks of those searching for solutions.
   The bond between the United States and Italy runs deep.
   It's a bond of family, of culture, of shared interests and
common vision.
   And the world around us is changing, but we can be sure that our
friendship will endure.
   Mr. Prime Minister, when we last met, we talked of new
developments around the world, of change in the East, of new
opportunities for arms reductions, of the growing unity of Europe;
and in recent weeks, I've spoken of America's vision for world
peace.
   I have said that we are prepared to move beyond containment
toward a policy that works to bring the Soviet Union into the
community of nations.
   We will be actively engaged in Eastern Europe, promoting
measures to encourage political and economic liberalization in
Poland.
   The United States welcomes a stronger and more united Europe.
   We believe, as I know you do, that European unity and the
trans-Atlantic partnership reinforce each other.
   Over the next two days, we'll have the opportunity to engage in
renewed dialogue as partners, certainly as friends.
   And I hope that our conversations are shaped by our shared
expectations for the future and by our determination to see our
future succeed.
   I am delighted to be back in Rome.
   Thank you again for this warm welcome.

   The new Congress of People's Deputies nominated a
handful of radicals Friday to serve in its working legislature,
opening the lawmaking process to broader participation after
decades of Kremlin monopoly.
   But some progressives charged that Communist Party bureaucrats
had rigged the process to stay in power, and others accused the
radicals of undermining the course of political reform.
   With Lithuanians announcing at one point they would boycott
elections to choose the membership of the new legislature, the
Supreme Soviet, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev declared the
Congress of People's Deputies in a ``crisis situation'' on only the
second day of its existence.
   The 2,250-member parliament was choosing members to fill its
542-seat working legislature, called the Supreme Soviet.
   Candidates originally were selected in local caucuses. But they
had to be nominated by the congress before they could stand for
election. Most delegations nominated only one candidate for each
seat they were alloted, but a few offered more. It is in those
districts where there are real races. Candidates who get the
highest number of votes and more than 50 percent are elected.
   The final number of deputies nominated Friday was ``around
600,'' according to one official who addressed the congress.
   The deputies wrangled for hours over the nominations as members
bickered about procedure and traded accusations of obstructionism.
The debate got sidetracked by a heated squabble over police
attempts to break up a street meeting called to discuss the first
day of parliamentary debate.
   Voting finally began 12{ hours after the congress convened, with
weary deputies filing out of the hall to cast ballots. Results were
expected when the congress meets again Saturday morning.
   Populist Boris N. Yeltsin was on the list of 573 congress
members selected by their home regions to serve in the Supreme
Soviet _ which took its name from the old, rubber-stamp parliament.
The procedure set up tough races for lawmakers from Moscow, where
some of the best-known progressives are running.
   ``The party apparatus is once again asking us to elect the
Supreme Soviet according to the old system,'' complained deputy
Vladimir Shevlyuga of Rostov-on-Don.
   Vladimir Zolotukhin of Uzbekistan complained the top party and
government officials in his Central Asian republic had nominated
themselves as in the past.
   Nevertheless, the candidates' list showed that the new Supreme
Soviet will have a far different makeup from the old one, which met
for only a few days a year to unanimously approve any bill put
before it and vigorously applaud the speeches of top Kremlin
officials.
   Only one member of the ruling party Politburo _ Russian
federation President Vitaly I. Vorotnikov _ is on the list of
candidates.
   Nominations were closed for most republics, assuring the
election of a small group of progressives, including Estonian Marju
Lauristin and Lithuanian Kazimir Motieka, Popular Front leaders who
led fights to declare their republics sovereign.
   Live coverage by state-run TV continued to show Soviets the
novel spectacle of their representatives openly airing
disagreements, and many viewers were riveted to their sets, despite
the snail's pace of parliamentary action.
   The Lithuanians announced through Vytautas Landsbergis, chairman
of the grassroots reform group Sajudis, that they would boycott the
elections if deputies from other republics were allowed to vote on
which Lithuanians should serve in the Supreme Soviet.
   Landsbergis also said parliamentarians from his tiny homeland on
the Baltic Sea did not want to cast ballots to elect people to the
Supreme Soviet from other regions of this vast country.
   ``We can't elect people who are not known to us,'' he said.
``It's not right to vote in the darkness.''
   Roy Medvedev, a Moscow-based historian whose exposes of Josef
Stalin's bloody abuses of power were once banned in his native
country, appealed for reconsideration of the boycott threat.
   ``I ask the comrades from Lithuania ... not to break the huge
amount of work done in our society to democratize it,'' Medvedev
said, a giant statue of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin at his
back.
   Gorbachev, who chaired the meeting, said the Lithuanian boycott
sparked a ``crisis situation'' in the fledgling parliament. But
after murky debate and a series of recesses, the body moved toward
a secret ballot on the legislative candidates.
   The exchange demonstrated the competing interests even among
Soviet progressives. The Lithuanians and their Baltic neighbors
want to protect their small reform slates from being voted down in
an all-congress vote. They fear conservatives from the giant
Russian federation, the Ukraine or Central Asia could reject
reform-minded candidates from the Baltics.
   However, Moscow deputies, many of whom are national celebrities,
insisted on presenting a slate of 55 candidates for the 29 seats
allocated to them to underline the principle of contested elections.
   On the Moscow slate are some of the nation's best-known
progressives, including Medvedev; economist Gavril Popov; academic
Sergei Stankevich; Yuri Chernichenko, an agriculture reform
advocate; and Ilya Zaslavskaya, an advocate for the handicapped.
   Stankevich said reformers had gone into Friday's session seeking
a rule to bar regional Communist Party bosses from retaining their
jobs _ and the clout and perquisites they provide _ while serving
simultaneously in the Supreme Soviet.
   But when Gorbachev put the proposal to a vote, only 636 deputies
voted to relieve lawmakers of their previous jobs, although a
majority said members should not have to perform other duties
during legislative sessions, which are expected to last about eight
months of the year.

   In a break with Kremlin leaders' traditional
isolation, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov waded into a crowd of
reporters and parliamentarians outside the Congress on Friday.
   It was the second night in a row such a thing had happened. On
Thursday, Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov traded World War II
stories with deputies and Politburo member Vadim A. Medvedev
chatted with foreign reporters.
   Ryzhkov is No. 2 man in the Soviet government.
   After he genially answered questions on everything from housing
loans to private film-making in the dusk of a northern summer,
security men built like boxers lectured Soviet reporters for
snagging the boss for a second round of questioning before the
premier strode off under the Kremlin's blooming chestnuts and
lilacs.
   ``Hey, we're journalists, it's our job,'' said Mikhail Sokorov,
a local newspaper reporter.
   The security men had little to fear, however, as all the
deputies and news media people had passed a gauntlet of guards to
enter the brick-walled fortress in the center of Moscow during the
Congress.
   Still, it was a thrill for the mass of newly elected deputies
from ordinary walks of life to find their previously remote leaders
within touching distance. At least 50 crowded around Ryzhkov Friday
night, until the pack became so thick it was impossible to identify
the attraction in the middle.
   Ryzhkov's appearances carried a slight air of campaigning, since
he faces the Congress in his first election test possibly on
Saturday. The political reform that created the Congress also gave
it the power to confirm the premier, and he has come under fire
from a few deputies in the past week for his work on the economy
and the environment.
   ``My soul hurts when I think about pensions,'' Ryzhkov said
Friday in response to a question about a deputy's demand for
increases in payments as low as $36 a month to retirees.
   ``He says we must find the money. But how?''
   Ryzhkov said he is convinced that ``individual plots and the
construction of individual houses'' must be permitted to solve a
housing crunch, but left Moscow out of that possibility without
explaining.
   Development of the Soviet space shuttle led to creation of 100
new industrial materials, he boasted. But dragging those ideas into
the domestic economy is proving far harder.
   ``We should create such economic conditions that people chase
after them,'' he said.
   Private cooperatives may be controversial but they're an
explosive success in the government's economic reform program, he
said. In the 2{ years since the small businesses were legalized,
100,000 have cropped up. They contributed about $6.75 billion to
the economy in just the first three months of this year, he said.

   Students camped out in Beijing's central square
tried to gauge the shifting political winds Friday but said their
protest would continue no matter who runs the country.
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, the leader most sympathetic
to the demonstrators' demands, was reported to have been ousted and
placed under house arrest in a power struggle with Premier Li Peng.
   The number of students in Tiananmen Square had dwindled to about
15,000, but student leaders said they were undeterred by the
apparent ascendancy of Li, who has taken a much harder line with
the demonstrators.
   ``It's going to get more complex,'' said a student leader from
Qinghua University who would only give his name as Xin. ``We can't
ascertain what the leaders' intentions are, but we will not leave
the square.''
   Chinese sources say Zhao has been stripped of all powers and
that Li is in charge of party and government functons.
   ``Zhao Ziyang was relatively open-minded,'' Xin said atop the
People's Heroes Monument in Tiananmen Square, where the student
leaders have set up their headquarters. ``We don't feel that he was
the savior of all China, but he was more capable than Li Peng.''
   The students, who began their protests April 15 by seeking talks
with the government on social reforms and profiteering by
bureaucrats, are demanding Li's resignation.
   Zhao's apparent ouster has not weakened the students' resolve to
stay in the square until Li resigns because ``everybody in the
country is watching the square,'' Xin said. ``If we leave, we will
betray their hopes.''
   ``Students are not losing hope just because Zhao is sacked,''
said a Beijing medical student. ``Our belief is firm and cannot be
moved.''
   Ren Ju, a senior at the Central Nationalities Institute, said
students preferred Zhao over Li.
   ``We didn't really like Zhao Ziyang before all this started, but
after the hunger fast, he came to visit the strikers on the square
and said he would work to eradicate corruption starting with his
own children,'' Ren said.
   His removal will not deter students from their sit-in, Ren said.
   Guo Weiming, a senior at Xian Transportation College, said: ``We
don't feel simply that Zhao should replace Li,'' Guo said. ``I'm
not convinced he could represent the people's interests.''
   Zhao reportedly angered party conservatives with an impassioned
speech to a group of hunger strikers in Tiananmen last week, as
well as a detailed explanation to visiting Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev last week of a secret 1987 meeting confirming senior
leader Deng Xiaoping's paramount power.
   Last month he also called the student movement ``patriotic''
rather than Li's favored description, ``disturbances.''
   Not all students were convinced Zhao was truly out. ``I think
there's some kind of intrigue going on where we're deliberately
being sent the wrong signals,'' said a sophomore at Tianjin
Institute of Light Industry named Liang.
   ``Maybe word of Zhao's dismissal was deliberately leaked so
people would rally around him,'' Liang said. ``Then if he actually
came into power he would be in a better position to control the
masses.''

   Glen Ridge High School welcomed a
scheduled holiday Friday but the baseball team took the field
without its captain, a reminder of the upheaval over the arrests of
five students on sexual assault charges.
   Law enforcement officials, meanwhile, would not comment on a
newspaper report Friday that the students charged in the March 1
incident asked another student to videotape them having sex with
the mentally retarded girl on another occasion.
   The student, Charles Figueroa, a football teammate of some of
the boys charged, told the New York Post he refused to make the
tape and eventually informed authorities about the incident. There
was no answer Friday in repeated attempts to call Figueroa.
   Glen Ridge Superintendent of Schools Rose McCaffrey said
Figueroa's comments are suspect. ``Charlie has a knack of
fantasizing and takes off and starts discussing things,'' Ms.
McCaffrey said.
   ``I'm not saying this is not true at all,'' she said. ``Because
of the statements he made, we immediately notified police.''
   Ms. McCaffrey said Figueroa told a teacher what the other
students had told him about the sexual assault, and was kept out of
school for several days on the request of his mother, Mary, who
feared retaliation from students.
   Ray Weiss, a spokesman for the Essex County prosecutor's office,
would not comment on the report, but said, ``We are pursuing all
angles of the investigation.''
   There was no indication a second episode took place.
   The five students were arrested Wednesday and charged with
sexually assaulting a 17-year-old girl with a broomstick and
miniature baseball bat. Eight other male teens cheered the attack
without intervening, investigators said.
   Two of those charged, twin brothers Kyle and Kevin Scherzer, are
captains of the football team and Kyle is captain of the baseball
team, which played a game without him Friday.
   All five have been suspended from school for 10 days.
   ``The student body is divided but this is, I guess, to be
expected,'' said Ms. McCaffrey. ``There are feelings of friendship
and antagonism.''
   Some students friendly with those charged said the young woman,
who has since turned 18, willingly participated in the incident.
Friends of the young woman said she did not fully understand what
was happening.
   Officials have said she attends special education classes but
have not elaborated on the extent of her mental impairment.
   Attorneys for some of the boys charged Friday criticized the
media attention and the prosecutor's handling of the case.
   ``I think it's awful because, first of all, whether you're a
parent, victim or alleged defendant, it's a tragedy and there is a
presumption of innocence,'' said Donald W. Merkelbach, attorney for
the Scherzers.
   ``I understand the media's job but I think they have infringed
upon the presumption of innocence.''

<HEAD>600 Bodies Found In Post-War Mass Grave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mass grave discovered near the capital
last month contains the remains of more than 600 men, women and
children buried between 1944 and 1947 by Soviet and Polish secret
police, official and independent reports said Thursday.
   The bodies appear to include both German POWs and Polish
resistance fighters who were arrested by the Soviet secret police
after the war, according to Gazeta Wyborcza, an independent
Solidarity newspaper, and the officially published daily Express
Wieczorny.
   The investigation comes during increasing efforts, backed by the
communist government, to acknowledge repressions of the postwar
years.
   The chairman of the Council for Preserving the Memory of
Struggle and Martyrdom, Gen. Roman Paszkowski, told the state PAP
news agency Thursday that searches were in progress for graves of
Polish officers and other victims of ``reprisals of the Stalinist
period.''
   An unknown number of Poles, many of whom fought with the
underground Home Army against the Nazi occupiers during World War
II, were executed by Soviet secret police after the war.
   The Home Army remained loyal to the Polish government-in-exile
during the war, and the Soviets considered its officers suspect
when communists came to power in Poland after 1944. Some were
believed to have been executed in secret and others were deported
to Siberian prisons.
   ``We will do our best to commemorate events, places and figures
in our history in tune with historical truth,'' Paszkowski said.
   In Otwock, the bodies were found piled in five layers after a
journalist decided to follow up on rumors circulating in the area.
When bones and skulls were unearthed, the mayor named a priest and
two representatives of the independent Solidarity movement to an
investigatory commission.
   The commission examined about 400 bodies, and found 50 percent
had some signs of postmortem dissection. None had been victims of
shooting, according to PAP.
   The bodies were unclothed and no objects that could lead to
identification have been found in the grave, which is in a wooded
area, Gazeta Wyborcza said.
   Longtime residents told investigators about seeing the burial of
bodies of German POWs who died of disease and starvation at a
Soviet prison camp in the town, the newspaper said. The German
prisoners were pitifully thin and would plead through a fence for
scraps of bread, residents recalled.
   One witness recounted being told to bury his wife, a Polish Home
Army officer arrested on charges of anti-Soviet activities by the
Polish secret police. She died at the Soviet prison hospital in
Otwock in 1947, he said.
   Maria Grzeskowiak, interviewed in Express Wieczorny, said she
was a nurse at the hospital and tended to dying German POWs and
Home Army prisoners whose bodies were taken to be buried.

   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens was convicted
Friday of having sex with a 16-year-old girl whose mother accused
the congressman of offering a government job to buy her silence.
   Hours after the verdict, one Ohio congressman called for Lukens'
resignation, but an aide predicted he would seek re-election next
year.
   ``I think he should do the gentlemanly thing and resign,'' said
Rep. Chalmers Wylie, the senior Republican among Ohio's
congressional delegation. Lukens also is a Republican.
   A jury deliberated for 1{ hours before finding Lukens guilty of
contributing to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor, stemming
from an incident last Nov. 6. The misdemeanor carries a maximum
sentence of 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Lukens stood still, his hands pressed on the defense table and
his mouth slightly open, as Franklin County Domestic Relations
Judge Ronald Solove read the verdict.
   The 58-year-old divorced congressman from Middletown was
indicted Feb. 23, about three weeks after Columbus television
station WSYX broadcast a secretly recorded videotape that appeared
to show Lukens offering to find the girl's mother, Anna Coffman, a
job. She had gone to the station to get help and agreed to the
secret taping.
   On the tape, the woman asked Lukens why he was ``messing
around'' with her daughter, Rosie. Lukens replied, ``Well, first of
all, I didn't really know she was a teen-ager.''
   Toward the end of the tape, Lukens said, ``Let me go back (to
Washington) and see what there is part-time and ... (inaudible).
... I don't know what, uh, the government has, but I can check and
find out.''
   Mrs. Coffman testified that the offer was to try to buy her
silence, while Lukens called it an extortion attempt.
   Rosie Coffman told reporters she was pleased with the verdict.
   ``I'm happy to see justice is done,'' she said. Asked if she
hated Lukens, said said, ``No, I don't hate him. I don't hate
anybody.''
   A misdemeanor conviction does not automatically trigger an
Ethics Committee investigation or bar a member from sitting in
Congress. The committee does have the option of investigating such
cases and recommending action such as censure.
   Solove delayed sentencing pending the completion of a
presentence investigation.
   Lukens declined to comment on the verdict before he left the
courthouse through a private hallway and elevator. His chief of
staff, William Jarrell, said he planned to make a statement next
week about his personal and political future.
   ``The congressman will be spending some quiet time, speaking to
family and friends to get a lot of opinion and advice,'' Jarrell
said. ``But I'll say this, we will be running.''
   Lukens was first elected to the House in 1966, serving two terms
before dropping out to make an unsuccessful bid for the Ohio
governorship. After serving terms in the state House of
Representatives, he returned to the U.S. House in 1987.
   Lukens' attorney, Thomas Tyack, said Lukens would appeal on the
grounds that evidence about the girl's background was not presented
to the jury.
   ``The primary grounds will be the exclusion of Ms. Coffman's
juvenile record, Children Services file and school records, which
were critical to our case,'' he said. ``I also found evidence of
reverse discrimination, which may be cited in the appeal.'' The
girl is black, and Lukens is white.
   Neither the girl nor her mother was in the courtroom when the
verdict was read.
   Assistant Prosecutor Rita Mangini said Lukens contributed to the
girl's unruliness and delinquency by giving her alcohol, paying for
her cab ride to his apartment and having sex with her because he
knew she was underage.
   During the grand jury investigation, the Franklin County
prosecutor sought an additional indictment stemming from an alleged
sexual encounter between Lukens and the girl in 1985, when she was
13. The grand jury determined there was insufficient evidence
because of conflicting testimony from the girl.

   Barbara Bush said Friday she's looking for a good
book to read but it won't be a gossipy new biography about former
first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.
   ``I'm not going to read that,'' the first lady said. ``It's not
a nice book.''
   Commenting on two books being written about her now, Mrs. Bush
said, ``Trust me, they're not going to be page-turners unless
they're fiction.''
   Accompanying President Bush to Rome, the first stop on a
four-nation European tour, Mrs. Bush chatted with reporters on Air
Force One for about 20 minutes during the nine-hour flight across
the Atlantic.
   For the trip, she changed from a black and white dress she wore
to a departure ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base to tan slacks and
a turquoise knit top and red loafers.
   Despite a thyroid ailment that has irritated her eyes and caused
a weight loss, Mrs. Bush said she felt wonderful and was swimming
and playing tennis daily. She said she expected to continue her
exercise regimen during her week in Europe.
   The discussion of books arose when she said she had brought
something to read but wasn't satisfied with it. ``I need a good
book,'' she said, quickly exhorting reporters not to invite the
public to deluge her with suggestions.
   Mrs. Bush said she was cooperating with the authors of two books
about her, but that the books were not officially authorized.
   ``Well, I can hardly wait to read them,'' she said. ``They'll be
a lot more interesting than my life.''
   Mrs. Bush said the idea of writing a book about her now is ``so
silly. I'm not done yet. I don't know what I want to be when I grow
up.''
   The first lady also disclosed she will host a White House
luncheon on June 5 for Senate wives, and that it will be attended
by former first ladies Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson, two former
presidents of the Senate wives' club.
   She showed off an engraved watch given to her last year by the
wives' club. She said she loves it.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University students decided Friday to keep
striking nationwide until they win ``final victory'' and receive
permission to register a pro-Solidarity association, spokesmen said.
   Members of the banned Independent Students Association, or NZS,
said they formed an interschool strike committee to coordinate
protest activities.
   Students stressed at a news conference that they did not want
their strike to disturb election campaigning now going on in Poland
and would not call for a boycott of the voting June 4.
   The annual exam period is scheduled to begin Monday, and strike
organizers said students should take their examinations. Strikers,
however, planned to continue to occupy academic buildings.
   ``The national strike committee created today has decided to
continue the strikes until final victory,'' a statement read at a
student rally said.
   The strikes began Tuesday after a Warsaw court rejected the
application to register NZS. The court said the group illegally
claimed the right to hold strikes.
   Banners saying, ``We demand registration of NZS'' hung from the
gates of Warsaw University and Warsaw Polytechnic, an engineering
school.
   NZS spokesman Slawomir Gorecki reported student strikes in
Wroclaw, Lodz, Poznan and Plock, and strike alerts in other cities.
Authorities made no attempt to evict the strikers.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Poland's Roman Catholic
primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, endorsed NZS's right to be
registered and offered their help.
   Actor Andrzej Lapicki, a Solidarity parliamentary candidate,
appeared with French movie star Yves Montand on Friday at a rally
of about 750 students at Warsaw University and both voiced support
for the students' cause.
   Montand told the crowd through an interpreter, ``To defend
Solidarity means to defend democracy and freedom in Europe and in
the world. And today, I feel united with Solidarity and with Warsaw
students. I also feel united with students in Beijing and in
China.''
   After the rally, about 100 of the students blocked a main street
in front of the university for about one hour before giving up the
blockade peacefully.

<HEAD>Mondale Won't Challenge Boschwitz; Rules Out Other Campaigns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY R. SANDOK</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A Minnesota political era ended Friday when
former Vice President Walter F. Mondale said he will not challenge
Republican U.S. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz in 1990 or seek any other
elective office in the future.
   ``I believe it's time for other candidates to step forward,''
said Mondale, a former senator who was the Democratic Party's
presidential nominee in 1984. ``It was a very difficult choice for
us.''
   Mondale and his mentor, the late Hubert H. Humphrey, dominated
Minnesota politics from 1948, when Humphrey was elected to the U.S.
Senate, to 1980, when the Carter-Mondale ticket lost the
presidential race. Both Mondale and Humphrey, who died in 1978,
represented Minnesota in the Senate, served as vice president and
were unsuccessful Democratic presidential nominees.
   ``A lot of the people I worked for have been dead for a long
time and at some point, even Mondale has to get out,'' said
Mondale, 61. ``One of the requirements of a healthy party is that
it renews itself. You can't keep running Walter Mondale for
everything.''
   Mondale said he and his wife, Joan, have enjoyed his life out of
political office and has seen too many colleagues remain in the
Senate for too long.
   ``I'm at peace with myself,'' Mondale said. ``We took a lot of
time making this decision and it's a basic one. It's a lot easier
deciding when to get into politics as opposed to when to leave.''
   U.S. Rep. Tim Penny, D-Minn., said Mondale has positioned
himself to play the role of elder statesman.
   ``I grew up during the Humphrey-Mondale era in Minnesota,'' said
Penny, 37. ``I guess this kind of closes the chapter on this book.''
   Mondale generally had been considered the most formidable
candidate Democrats could field against Boschwitz, a two-term
senator. His announcement was expected to result in an immediate
scramble among Minnesota Democrats for their party's 1990 U.S.
Senate endorsement.
   Boschwitz, 58, said he was relieved that Mondale had decided not
to run. But Boschwitz said the race could be tough no matter who
his challenger is because of Minnesota's tendency to favor
Democrats.
   ``I'm not breathing easy,'' he said. ``I'm going to keep going.''
   Democratic National Committee member Paul Wellstone, a political
science professor at Carleton College and a leader of the Rev.
Jesse Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign in Minnesota, is the
only announced challenger.
   Other Democrats who on Friday said they were considering bids
now that Mondale is out of the race included department store heir
Mark Dayton, who unsuccessfully challenged Republican Sen. Dave
Durenberger in 1982; Hennepin County Commissioner John Derus, who
unsuccessfully sought the Democratic endorsement to challenge
Boschwitz in 1984; and Minneapolis attorney Tom Berg, a former U.S.
attorney and head of Gov. Rudy Perpich's fund-raising committee.
   Mondale, a lawyer, represented Minnesota in the Senate from 1965
until 1976, when he left to be Jimmy Carter's vice president. He
lost to Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential campaign.

   Soldiers searched the offices
of four labor, peasant and human rights organizations Friday and
cordoned off others after a night of guerrilla attacks on the
capital.
   The U.S.-supported government and the armed forces suspect the
organizations of being fronts for the leftist rebels who began a
civil war nine years ago.
   Troops from the 1st Army Brigade, the National Police and
Treasury Police took part in the operation.
   One union organization said two of its leaders had been
arrested. Police spokesmen consulted by telephone said they had no
information on the matter.
   Col. Orlando Zepeda, commander of the 1st Army Brigade, accused
the organizations Thursday night of harboring guerrillas who had
attacked his men at dusk. Fighting continued in much of northern
San Salvador for more than an hour.
   Several guerrilla attack were reported, and fighting in the
capital was the heaviest in years. Officials reported seven people
killed and 20 wounded.
   Security in and around San Salvador was noticeably stronger
Friday morning. Soldiers and police stopped and searched vehicles
at roadblocks.
   Attacks on the capital have increased recently in a campaign the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front calls ``All Against
Arena. We're going to Win.''
   Arena is the Spanish acronym for Republican Nationalist
Alliance, the rightist party of President-elect Alfredo Cristiani,
who will be inaugurated June 1.

   The 66-year-old former commandant
of a Nazi prisoner of war camp was convicted Friday of the 1944
murder of two inmates and sentenced to life in prison.
   Horst Czerwinski had been accused of shooting to death eight
Russian prisoners at Lagischa camp near Auschwitz, in what is now
Poland. Lagischa was a Nazi labor camp for captured Russian,
French, Polish and Hungarian soldiers. In a trial in Lueneburg that
lasted for years and included testimony from 204 witnesses,
Czerwinski was convicted of killing two of the inmates.
   Czerwinski insisted he did not carry out any of the murders, but
the court ruled former inmates provided irrefutable testimony that
he executed two Russian prisoners in the camp's laundry barracks
after they tried to escape.
   Until his arrest in 1985 on new evidence, Czerwinski was a
butcher in Celle, about 25 miles northwest of Hanover.

   Denmark, which has been in the
vanguard of homosexual rights for 60 years, enacted a law Friday
allowing civil marriages between couples of the same sex.
   The legislation gives homosexual couples the same rights as in a
conventional marriage regarding inheritance, taxation, joint rights
to pensions and property ownership.
   Gay couples, however, are not permitted to adopt children.
   ``Two persons of the same sex can let their partnership be
registered,'' said Article 1 of the bill, in what amounted to a
permission for a civil marriage.
   At least one partner must be a Danish citizen. Unlike in a
conventional marriage, the non-Danish partner would not be entitled
to citizenship as a consequence of marrying a Dane.
   Denmark legalized homosexuality in 1930 and has had an active
gay rights movement since 1948. Authorities estimate about 20,000
homosexuals cohabit in this country of 5.1 million people.
   The law was designed to give homosexual couples greater social
acceptibility. Proponents hoped the move would encourage couples to
stay together longer and discourage promiscuity, which they said
increases the danger of contracting AIDS.
   The bill was proposed by the leftist opposition but breezed
through with the support of Prime Minister Poul Schlueter's
minority centrist coalition.
   Parliament members who objected were asked to abstain to ensure
easy passage. The small Christian Peoples Party was the main
opponent of the bill.

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia Expels Britons in Retaliation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs on Tass chief protesting.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government responded Friday to
Britain's expulsion of four Czechoslovaks by ordering four Britons
out of the country for ``activities incompatible with their
status,'' the standard term for spying.
   Three British diplomats and a businessman were ordered to leave
within two weeks, the official news agency CTK reported.
   The British Foreign Office described the action as unjustified
retaliation for the order Thursday that four Czechoslovak diplomats
leave Britain for the same reason.
   CTK said the Foreign Ministry summoned Laurence O'Keefe, the
British ambassador, to receive a ``resolute protest of groundless
charges'' against the four Czechoslovaks.
   Britain's decision is in conflicts with ``the process of
strengthening confidence and security in Europe,'' the agency
declared in its report.
   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman identified the Britons as
Tony Arnold, first secretary of administration; Rick Todd, first
secretary counselor; Patricia Holland, third secretary; and Nick
Brooks, manager for Shell Oil.
   ``It's clearly an unjustified action,'' said the spokesman,
speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. ``It's clearly
in retaliation,'' he added, and the government will ``consider what
our response will be.''
   After Britain ordered the Czechslovaks to leave, the Communist
Party daily Rude Pravo said it was another case of ``British
spymania, which certain British circles bring about from time to
time.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons on
Thursday the expulsions of the Czechoslovaks and of 11 Soviets a
week ago were necessary ``regardless of the effect upon our
relations.''
   Britain had enjoyed its best relations with the Soviet Union
since World War II before the exchange last week, and relations
with Czechoslovakia were improving.
   Sir John Fretwell, Foreign Office political director, said
Czechoslovakia ignored warnings about in its diplomats given last
September, when three others were expelled.
   The exchange with Moscow began May 19 when Britain ordered eight
Soviet diplomats and three journalists out. Moscow retaliated a day
later with expulsions of like number and kind.
   Britain and the Soviets now are discussing Kremlin demands that
Britain reduce to 205 the number of Britons and local employees in
the Soviet Union. Moscow says that matches the number of Soviets
allowed in Britain.
   Director General Leonid Kravchenko, head of the Soviet news
agency Tass, protested in a letter to Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe on Friday over the expulsion of London-based Tass
correspondent Igor Peskov.
   Kravchenko said Peskov, 35, was a man of ``impeccable honesty''
and had done nothing to contravene British or international law.
   British newspaper reports, quoting government sources in London,
said Peskov headed a spy ring offering bribes in return for
industrial secrets. Peskov denied it. Britain disclosed no specific
reason for the expulsions.
   Howe said in Birmingham Friday that Britain will continue to
take a tough line to defend national security.

   Students blocked streets and set tires on
fire Friday and a boy was reported killed during a third straight
day of clashes between protesters and security forces in a
midwestern city.
   The protesters are demonstrating against sharp rises in the
price of some basic foods and services, resulting from the
government's strict adherence to an austerity program demanded by
Western creditors.
   The state-controlled News Agency of Nigeria said an order by the
military governor to shoot rioters on sight and a dusk-to-dawn
curfew failed to quell the disturbances in Benin, 165 miles east of
Lagos.
   At least 100 people have been reported injured, 15 serious
enough to require hospitalization, Lagos newspapers said. The
University of Benin was ordered closed, the news agency said.
   At one stage, rioters stormed Radio Nigeria's local broadcast
station and forced workers to flee, the news agency reported. The
dead youth's body was found in front of the station, it said.
   Lagos newspapers said police had avoided confronting the rioters
during the first two days of demonstrations.
   The students, joined by some local street traders, market women,
taxi drivers and unemployed men, also broke into a local jail and
freed 600 prisoners.
   Disturbances were reported earlier in the week in several other
university cities, including Lagos, but they died out quickly.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Cross Appalachians; Rivers Overflow in Ohio, Indiana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms on Friday brought hail and damaging winds from
Missouri and Arkansas into the central Appalachians, and flooding
from heavy rain continued in Ohio and Indiana.
   Flooding in southwest Ohio left at least three people missing. A
20-month-old boy was swept away after he fell into a rain-swollen
creek northeast of Dayton, Ohio, authorities said. At Miamitown, a
one-lane temporary bridge washed away, sending a car and a pickup
truck into the Great Miami River. Floods also forced the evacuation
of about 200 people in Camden.
   Rivers continued to rise in parts of Indiana and Ohio as a
result of heavy rains Thursday. The White River was expected to
crest 2 feet above flood stage on Saturday at Noblesville, Ind.,
and at Ravenswood, Ind., flooding homes.
   Thunderstorms dropped golf-ball-size hail near Batesville, Ark.,
and one-inch-diameter hail near Senath, Mo., and in Simpson County,
Ky.
   The storms extended from southeast Missouri and northeast
Arkansas across parts of Kentucky and Tennessee into West Virginia,
which experienced damaging winds Friday night.
   Showers fell and some thunderstorms occurred across eastern
Pennsylvania and eastern New York.
   A stationary thunderstorm dumped more than three-quarters of an
inch of rain on Key West, Fla., in an hour and a half.
   Key West also had a record-tying high temperature of 91 degrees.
San Antonio had a record high of 97.
   Rain showers were scattered over northern Kansas and along the
Washington state coast.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
nearly an inch and a quarter at Fayetteville, Ark., almost
three-quarters of an inch at Jackson, Ky., and more than one-third
inch at Elkins, W.Va., and Albany, N.Y.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 46
degrees at Sault Saint Marie, Mich., and Goodland, Kan., to 99
degrees at Cotulla, Texas, and Laredo, Texas. The nation's low
Friday morning was 15 degrees at Jackson, Wyo.
   The forecast for Saturday called for showers and thunderstorms
scattered from the Texas Gulf Coast across the lower Mississippi
Valley to much of the Atlantic Coast. Rain showers were predicted
from the northern Pacific Coast into the northern Rockies. Clear
skies were expected over much of the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 50s and 60s along much of
the Pacific Coast and into the northern Rockies; the 60s from
eastern Minnesota and eastern Iowa across the Great Lakes into
northern New England; and the 90s from along the southern Atlantic
Coast across Florida, along the Gulf Coast, across the southern
half of Texas into inland valleys of Southern California. Readings
were expected to climb above 100 degrees in the desert Southwest
and Rio Grande Valley. Highs in the rest of the nation were
forecast generally in the 70s and 80s.

<HEAD>Asahi President Quits After Cameraman Damages Rare Coral Reef</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Japan's second-largest newspaper
said Friday he will resign to take responsibility for an incident
in which a staff photographer damaged a rare coral reef to
illustrate a story on environmental destruction.
   Asahi Shimbun President Toichiro Hitotsuyanagi told a news
conference he will be succeeded by Toshitada Nakae, currently a
managing director, on June 24. Hitotsuyanagi has served as Asahi
president since December 1984.
   The newspaper said it has received ``bitter and growing''
complaints from readers about the incident last month, when its
cameraman reportedly carved the initials ``KY'' in the surface of a
rare underwater coral for a photograph of damage to the reef
allegedly caused by private divers.
   An article accompanying a front-page color photograph of the
carved initials in the newspaper's April 20 edition criticized the
``spiritual poverty'' of Japanese who damage the environment.
   The incident has since received wide coverage in the Japanese
press, with several newspapers condemning the Asahi.
   The Asahi has apologized twice editorially for the incident.
   The reef, 13 feet in height and 66 feet in circumference, is
said to be the largest in the world of its species, Galaxea
Fascicularis.
   Located in the southern islands of Okinawa, it is designated a
protected area by Japan's Environment Agency, but some pieces of
coral have been broken off by the air tanks of divers, the Asahi
article said.
   Violaters of the Nature Conservation Law are liable for up to
six months in jail and a fine of up to $714.
   After a series of protests by local divers, the Asahi admitted
its photographer intentionally damaged the coral reef.
   Earlier this month, the newspaper demoted its managing editor
and photo department chief in connection with the incident. The
photographer has been dismissed.

<HEAD>City Official Draws Protest For Remark on Jews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city legislator from an
ultrarightist party stirred up a storm of protest Friday when a
newspaper quoted him as saying that ``Jews are plundering us
again'' and ``something must be done about this.''
   West German ARD television said the city prosecutor's office had
started an investigation against 78-year-old Erich Gutjahr for
possibly violating German laws with his reported statements.
   Several members of the city council demanded the resignation of
Gutjahr, a 78-year-old member of the rightist National Party of
Germany, known by its German initials, NPD.
   The NPD, whose views are often likened to those of German
neo-Nazi groups, won seven city council seats in local elections in
March, giving the ultrarightist party a minority voice in the
law-making body.
   Gutjahr, in an interview printed Friday by the Frankfurt
Allgemeine newspaper, was quoted as saying, ``Jews have bought up
half of the city.''
   According to the newspaper, Gutjahr also said: ``The Jews are
plundering us again. Something must be done about this.''
   He could not be reached Friday to comment on the newspaper
report.
   Gutjahr, a strident anti-communist, also said he would rather
see city property put under government control before more of it is
sold to Jewish buyers, the newspaper reported.
   The elderly councilman denied being anti-Semitic but said he
only wants to protect ``German interests,'' it said.
   The newspaper further quoted him as insulting West German
President Richard von Weizsaecker by calling the liberal-leaning
president a ``lump,'' a degrading German word meaning ``limp
worthless rag.''
   Legislator Jo Meergans, a member of the city's governing Social
Democratic Party, said Gutjahr's remarks constituted a violation of
West Germany's laws against inciting the public. He demanded the
Frankfurt prosecutor's office launch an investigation, which the
television said had already begun.

<TEXT>
   British Broadcasting Corp. media and production
workers went on strike Friday for the third time in 4{ weeks to
demand a 16 percent pay raise that would bring their salaries in
line with those in commercial TV and radio.
   BBC was forced to cancel some scheduled news and current affairs
programs because of the 24-hour strike by about 12,000 workers
beginning at midnight. In the earlier walkouts _ on April 24 for 24
hours and May 9-10 for 48 hours _ the unions warned BBC well in
advance. But workers Friday gave only a one-day warning.
   The dispute involves the National Union of Journalists, the
Broadcasting Entertainment Trades Alliance and the Association of
Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians.
   Chief union negotiator Roger Bolton said employees walked out
Friday because the BBC has refused to reopen contract negotiations
or increase their offer of a 7 percent pay increase.
   Unions say the national average pay for a BBC journalist is
$26,860 a year, compared with $37,920 in commercial radio or TV.
   The BBC says it cannot afford more than a 7 percent pay
increase. BBC domestic TV and radio services are funded by licenses
collected from 19.3 million owners and renters of TV sets. BBC
World Service radio broadcasting is financed by a government grant.
Commercial TV and radio are financed by advertising.

<TEXT>
   The race between El Paso mayoral
candidates Suzie Azar and Ed Elsey, which once turned on issues
such as economic development and crime, became personal as
Saturday's runoff neared.
   The two city council members achieved a runoff by defeating four
other mayoral candidates in the general election May 6.
   Mrs. Azar outpolled Elsey 31 percent to 23 percent, but Elsey
since has refused to make a public appearance with Mrs. Azar until
she reveals how much her family makes from businesses on property
they lease from the city near the El Paso International Airport.
   Elsey says Mrs. Azar could face a conflict of interest in votes
on airport matters.
   Under Elsey's prodding, Mrs. Azar issued a statement saying she
and her husband had a net worth of about $3.7 million. But she has
not revealed how much she and her husband earn from property near
the airport, calling Elsey's questions a smoke screen.
   Elsey, owner of a medical supply business, lists his net worth
at $378,875.
   Since Elsey brought up the income topic two weeks ago, both
candidates have ignored issues such as what kinds of businesses to
attract, how to reduce crime, whether to raise taxes and how to
deal with rapid population growth.
   Both newspapers have endorsed Mrs. Azar, a Democrat, while
outgoing Mayor Jonathan Rogers supports Elsey. By law, Rogers had
to step down this time after four consecutive two-year terms.
   If Mrs. Azar wins, El Paso will become the fourth of Texas' five
largest cities to elect a woman mayor. Houston, Dallas and San
Antonio are all led by women.
   Unlike most major Texas cities, El Paso has a strong mayor and
no city manager. The mayor appoints members of city boards and
supervises department heads and thus holds the most powerful
position in city government.

   An airplane carrying race fans from South
Dakota to the Indianapolis 500 crashed in a softball field Friday,
killing two aboard and injuring three others.
   The plane, a twin-engine Beechcraft Baron, crashed at about 2:30
p.m. after the pilot notified the Indianapolis International
Airport he was having ``serious fuel problems,'' said Barbara
Dettmer, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration in
Chicago.
   FAA and National Transportation Safety Board officials were at
the scene investigating the cause of the crash.
   Johnson County Sheriff Doran Miller said the plane was heading
for Indianapolis, 11 miles north of Greenwood, for the Indianapolis
500 on Sunday. The flight originated in Sioux Falls, S.D.
   The two victims were identified as Robert Best, 69, and Warren
E. Schoon, 68, both of Sioux Falls, S.D. Miller said both men were
thrown from the plane.
   Two other passengers, Arnold Tofteland, 60, of Luverne, Minn.,
and Ross Fenn, 62, of Sioux Falls, S.D., were taken to Indianapolis
hospitals in critical condition. The pilot, Larry Larson, 29, of
Sioux Falls, was in serious but stable condition at University
Heights Hospital, a spokesman said.
   One witness, Max Maddox, said he was on a nearby golf course and
watched the plane crash in a softball field behind the Community
Church of Greenwood.
   ``It had no power. The propellers were just fanning in the wind.
I kept watching him drop and drop, and then I saw some smoke,''
Maddox said.
   The plane was attempting to make an emergency landing at the
Greenwood Municipal Airport when it crashed about four miles away,
said airport spokesman Aaron Pietras.

   The USS Iowa sailor linked to investigation of the
massive explosion aboard the battleship Friday denied wrongdoing
and charged the Navy was seeking a scapegoat.
   Kendall Truitt, 21-year-old gunner's mate 3rd class, got
high-profile Miami attorney Ellis Rubin to represent him. Rubin
warned that continued allegations against Truitt, from
homosexuality to that he intentionally caused the explosion that
killed 47 sailors April 19, would be ``answered in court.''
   Truitt and Clayton Hartwig, 25-year-old gunner's mate who died
in the gun turret blast, were best friends and took out $100,000
life insurance policies naming each other as the beneficiaries.
Navy investigators have said they are looking into the
relationship, including a reported falling-out last year when
Truitt was married, as they study homicide as a possibility in the
case.
   ``I think the Navy is at a loss,'' Truitt said. ``They're just
looking for a scapegoat.''
   Rubin said Navy intelligence had ``leaked the charges to the
press little by little'' to create what he called a ``media
frenzy.''
   He said Truitt had come to South Florida ``seeking counsel and
advice in connection with these vicious, untrue, false and
malicious rumors leaked by the intelligence service of the Navy and
transmitted to favored elements of the media.
   ``They have no evidence,'' he said. ``They don't even have
probable cause.''
   Rubin said Truitt risked his life to save other sailors after
the explosion.
   Truitt and wife, Carole, joined Rubin outside the attorney's law
offices for a news conference in which Truitt denied allegations
against him. Rubin asked if he were a homosexual, which Truitt
denied, and then asked Truitt's wife if he were a good lover. She
replied affirmatively.
   In a later interview on the NBC-TV network news, Truitt said he
and Hartwig ``never had a complete falling-out'' and the two had
talked several days before the fatal cruise.
   ``He was very excited about his new orders'' to work as a driver
at the U.S. embassy in London, Truitt said.
   Thursday, the Navy said Truitt was being transferred to the
staff commander of Destroyer Squadron eight, in Mayport because of
the extensive publicity surrounding the Iowa explosion.
   The New York Times reported Thursday that unidentified Pentagon
sources said they found no ``physical evidence indicating the blast
was caused by a zmechanical or electrical failure or any other
material problem.''
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said improper storage of the
powder had been ruled out as a cause.
   But Rubin said the powder used in the turret where the blast
occurred was stored on barges where temperatures reached the 90s
and were 25 degrees higher inside the barge.
   ``Anyone familiar with gunpowder knows it becomes unstable when
it gets over 100 degrees,'' he said.
   NBC reported that unidentified sources said the Navy is
investigating the possibility that a detonating device was hidden
in a burlap patch inserted between bags of powder to clean the
barrels of the ship's guns.
   Deborah Johnson, a Naval Investigative Service agent in Norfolk,
Va., said a search of Truitt's home following the April 19 blast
produced one of the burlap patches, adding that it was not tampered
with.
   At Friday's news conference, Truitt said his home had not been
searched.
   Rubin said he wanted access to the Navy investigation and wanted
to go aboard the USS Iowa. He said he was a former Navy commander
and is familiar with gun turret operations, as well as with Navy
legal procedures. Rubin said he was certain there would be no
court-martial against Truitt.

<HEAD>Effects of Boston School Plan Debated In Federal Court</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 13th graf, `But Garrity...,' to CORRECT total number of
students to 57,000, sted 14,000; give percentage of white students.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers debated in federal court Friday whether a
plan to let parents choose their children's schools would reverse
years of efforts to integrate Boston's classrooms.
   Supporters say the plan, scheduled to take effect this fall for
kindergarten, first- and sixth-grade students, would foster
competition among schools and improve teaching.
   But a lawyer representing students in a desegregation case
dating to 1972 argued that the plan would bring a substantial
resegregation of the city's public schools after 15 years of busing
for integration.
   The lawyer, Thomas Atkins, said the plan has merit but needs
adjusting. The proposed plan would allow parents to choose their
children's schools within three geographical zones, provided rough
racial balance is maintained.
   ``This approach holds great promise in this school district,''
he said. But, he added, ``We believe the very promise the plan
represents cautions against a premature, poorly planned start.''
   Putting the plan into effect in September ``would have an
adverse impact on the students in this school system _ white ones,
black ones and other ones,'' Atkins said.
   Attorney Henry Dinger, representing the school committee, argued
that the assignment plan was a ``logical extension of desegregation
technology employed by the courts in this case.''
   Judge W. Arthur Garrity listened to the lawyer's arguments and
continued the hearing until Tuesday morning after testimony from
school committee member Juanita Wade and School Superintendent
Laval S. Wilson.
   Garrity presided over the court-ordered desegregation of
Boston's schools in the 1970s, when the city was convulsed by
protests that sometimes turned violent.
   Garrity expressed doubt about some of the language of the plan,
prompting Wilson to say he would support any modifications
necessary to prevent misinterpretations.
   ``I will clearly make sure there is no resegregation. I don't
think there's any way this could occur,'' Wilson said.
   The school superintendent added that 73 percent of the
applications from parents for particular schools had been received,
and ``it would be exceedingly disruptive to cancel all those
assignments.''
   But Garrity said the small percentage of white students in city
schools _ about one-quarter of the 57,000 total, according to
committee member Wade _ was a subject of concern.
   ``Unless clear care is taken here, it would be very easy to have
a product where every white pupil is in a neighborhood school, and
unless those black children would take a bus, the number of
racially isolated schools in the city would increase
dramatically,'' Garrity said.
   Caroline Playther, a plaintiff intervener on the behalf of
Hispanic parents, also contended that the school assignment plan
would adversely affect Hispanic students.
   Dinger said some students might not be able to attend schools of
their choice under the plan, but it would ensure a racially diverse
student body in every school, give parents greater control over
their children's educations and improve educational quality.
   ``The plaintiff has submitted no evidence to say the result
would be segregation,'' he said.
   Wade testified that she supported the plan despite having
questions about the schedule for putting it into effect.

<TEXT>
   Now that Eastern Airlines has won court approval
to sell its profitable Northeast shuttle to developer Donald Trump,
attention is shifting to the rest of the strikebound carrier.
   The coming week could be critical in Eastern's 2{-month-old
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding and how it emerges from one of the
most contentious labor disputes in the commercial airline business.
   The committee representing the airline's major creditors is
expected to meet during the week, and a hearing is scheduled for
Thursday in federal bankruptcy court on the issue of appointing a
special trustee to run Eastern.
   ``Next week could be a very significant decision point,''
Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said Friday from the airline's Miami
headquarters.
   Two investor groups had submitted formal buyout proposals for
Eastern before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland approved the
$365 million shuttle sale to Trump on Thursday.
   The groups, one headed by former Piedmont Airlines chairman
William Howard and the other by Chicago commodities trader Joseph
Ritchie, are expected to present new financing plans in the coming
week for Eastern minus the shuttle, union representatives say.
   Even before the shuttle sale, David I. Shapiro, court-appointed
examiner for Eastern, had said the Howard and Ritchie groups would
have to put up more cash in their purchase proposals.
   Discussions between the investor groups and union
representatives were planned for the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
The unions' goal is for Eastern to be sold to a new owner and
resume operations by July 1, said Dan Ashby, a spokesman for the
Eastern pilots union.
   Eastern sought bankruptcy court refuge March 9, five days after
the start of a strike that grounded most of its flights.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.,
plans to rebuild Eastern as a smaller carrier and sell another $1.4
billion worth of Eastern assets besides the shuttle.
   The bankruptcy court, which must sanction any plan, has not
passed judgment on Lorenzo's strategy, although Eastern has been
making deals for the sale of aircraft, landing slots and other
assets in the event the plan is approved.
   At its meeting, the creditors' committee is expected to evaluate
Lorenzo's plan and, possibly, the revised Howard and Ritchie
proposals, sources close to the situation said.
   On Thursday, Lifland is scheduled to hear arguments on the
unions' request that a powerful trustee be appointed to run
Eastern, which would remove the airline from Lorenzo's control. The
company has opposed such a move.

   A temporary bridge collapsed Friday, plunging
as many as four autos into the swollen Great Miami River, and the
people inside were feared dead. A child was found dead in a creek
flooded by the same heavy rains.
   Widespread flooding in southwestern Ohio sent people scurrying
to rooftops and high ground. One couple and their 10-year-old son
were stranded on the roof of their house from morning until 5:30
p.m. when rescuers reached them by boat, the Butler County
Sheriff's Department said.
   In Camden, rescuers used lifelines and boats to lead 30
occupants of a trailer park through chest-high water to safety. A
total of 200 people were forced from their homes in the town of
about 1,900 people southwest of Dayton.
   Divers recovered the body of 20-month-old Brandon K. Irwin of
Springfield in Donnels Creek, northeast of Dayton, about 7:30 p.m.,
the sheriff's department said.
   Four hours earlier, authorities received a report that Brandon
wandered away from his grandmother, fell into the creek from a
bridge and was swept out of her reach. Sheriff's Lt. Vaughn
McKenney said two helicopters helped rescuers search for the boy.
   Swift currents and the danger of floating debris prevented
rescuers from going into the river where the bridge collapsed near
Miamitown, about seven miles east of Cincinnati, authorities said.
   Witnesses gave varying accounts of two to four vehicles falling
into the river, said Bruce Smith, chief of the Colerain Township
Fire Department.
   Radio station WCKY reported at least six people were missing. An
adult and four children were seen in a yellow pickup truck and at
least one person in a car which went under the water, WCKY reported.
   Hamilton County Sheriff's Lt. Col. Ramon Hoffbauer, when asked
if anyone could have survived a plunge into the river said, ``I
wouldn't think so.''
   ``The current is moving pretty fast. I can't tell you how fast,
but the rescue crews didn't go into the water at all,'' Hoffbauer
said.
   A 100-foot section of the center of the one-lane bridge fell
about 10 feet into the river at 5:27 p.m., Smith said. The bridge
was about 300 feet long.
   Tires, tree tops and barrels could be seen floating in the
river, but no vehicles were sighted, and they were presumed to have
floated downstream, Smith said.
   The river was at 19 feet, three feet above flood stage, and was
expected to crest at 23 feet Saturday morning, said Gary Miller,
director of disaster services for the Cincinnati chapter of the
American Red Cross.
   The Red Cross heard from several people who said relatives had
not arrived home on schedule Friday night, he said.
   The temporary bridge, built to carry traffic on U.S. 52 during
construction of a permanent span, collapsed when wooden supports
that held the roadway deck failed, said Hamilton County Engineer
Donald Schramm.
   Schramm said the contractor that built the bridge called the
engineer's office about 10 minutes before the collapse and
suggested closing the span because of debris in the water.
   Schramm said an order was issued immediately, but the collapse
occurred before barricades could be set up.
   Ron Wells said he crossed the bridge just before it collapsed.
   ``I turned around and looked. I saw the back of a car going in.
A couple more sections of the bridge fell after that,'' he said.
   The flooding in Camden was caused when a two-hour downpour
pushed the Sevenmile Creek beyond its banks and into low-lying
areas.
   ``It was scary,'' said Assistant Fire Chief Dave Steele. ``To
some individuals, they have lost everything. We do have trailers
that have been washed off their foundations.''
   He said water was 5 feet deep in some houses.
   Firefighter Joseph Ball said he and others rescued about 30
people in a trailer park near the creek by trying rope from the
trailers to trees. Evacuees clung to the rope as they waded through
the floodwaters to boats.
   Chuck Weinstiger, one of the people rescued from the trailer
park, said the water was chest-deep as he made his way to safety
with the rope. A firefighter carried his 1-year-old daughter in his
jacket.
   ``It's kind of scary when you have a baby,'' Weinstiger said.
   Another resident, Charlie Spencer, said he carried an elderly
woman from her house. He said he chained his car to a tree to keep
it from floating away.
   Six families were flooded out of their homes in Butler County,
also in southwestern Ohio, said sheriff's dispatcher Diana Dunn.
   The Butler evacuees stayed with friends and relatives, Ms. Dunn
said. Most of the Camden evacuees were sent to an elementary
school, but all had left by late morning when floodwaters began to
recede.

   Riot police used water cannon to
battle rock-throwing leftist militants on Friday at an illegal
squatters' camp near Hamburg's waterfront.
   No injuries were reported immediately.
   Some of the rundown trailers that made up the camp caught fire
during the melee, sending up a thick cloud of black smoke.
   Fighting broke out after police ordered the leftists to remove
15 camping and construction trailers they had set up in the
Hafenstrasse area this year.
   The leftists towed away 10 trailers, but left five behind and
announced they would resist authorities' efforts to clear the area.
   Thousands of people _ protesters and onlookers _ gathered at the
site as riot police and federal border police ringed the area with
armored vehicles and water cannon. About 2,500 officers were
ordered to the site or put on standby.
   According to police reports, militants fired flare guns and
threw rocks at police.
   Four trailers suddenly caught fire _ cause of which is yet to be
determined _ and the press of people kept firemen from reaching the
site.
   Police then turned on water cannon and moved in to clear the
area.
   Leftists and their sympathizers are occupying abandoned
buildings in the Hafenstrasse area. Officials have been trying to
find ways to evict them and still avoid a violent showdown.

<HEAD>Magnuson Remembered with Stories About His Political Skill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Sen. Warren G. Magnuson was eulogized
Thursday as a good friend, skilled politician and powerful leader
who never forgot to represent the powerless.
   About 1,000 mourners filled St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral here
to speak kind words and swap stories about ``Maggie,'' the low-key,
personable workhorse who was among the century's most powerful
senators.
   ``He was a marvelous example of how public power can be linked
to public good,'' House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., said in
a reflection on Magnuson's life.
   Magnuson, a Democrat whose congressional career spanned 44
years, died Saturday at his Seattle home of congestive heart
failure, brought on by his long fight with diabetes. He was 84.
   In addition to Foley, those who spoke at the service included
Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., and Sens. Brock Adams, D-Wash., Daniel
Inouye, D-Hawaii, and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.
   Mourners were led by Magnuson's wife of 25 years, Jermaine; his
daughter, Juanita Garrison; and his two grandchildren. They were
joined by virtually every Democrat in public office from the state,
including Gov. Booth Gardner, and Republican friends such as Sens.
Slade Gorton of Washington and Ted Stevens of Alaska.
   The ceremony was a celebration of Magnuson's life; there were
few tears, and more than a few laughs as speakers told anecdotes
about Magnuson's political skill.
   Inouye recalled Magnuson's request for $950 million in state aid
after the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, ``a sum unheard
of.''
   ``I turned to him and said, `Mr. Chairman, we have volcanoes in
Hawaii that erupt every day,''' Inouye said. ``He turned to me with
a twinkle in his eye and said, `Your turn will come.'''
   Magnuson, who served eight years in the House and 36 in the
Senate, rose to president pro tem of the Senate and was
Appropriations Committee chairman and the body's senior member when
he was defeated by Gorton in 1980, his only election loss.
   ``Maggie was powerful, incredibly powerful,'' Hatfield told the
gathering, ``but never because he lost touch with the powerless.''
   Magnuson's polished wood coffin, draped by an American flag, was
escorted by pallbearers made up of some of the former staff members
that Magnuson fondly referred to as his ``bumblebees.''
   The Rev. Lowell E. Knutson, bishop of the Northwest Synod of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, said that the
plain-speaking, cigar-loving Magnuson evidenced ``a hidden piety''
in his stewardship for the poor, the disenfranchised and the sick.
   Among his achievements, Magnuson counted the public
accommodations section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
establishment of public television and the Amtrak passenger
railroad, oil tanker safety laws, marine mammal protection and
consumer laws involving flammable fabrics, toy safety, truth in
lending, poison prevention packaging, truth in packaging and
labeling.

<HEAD>Opening Arguments Begin in Former Congressman's Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Pat Swindall negotiated for a month
or more to borrow what he thought was drug money and later lied
about it to a federal grand jury, a prosecutor said Thursday.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Gillen said during opening
arguments in Swindall's perjury trial that videotapes and other
evidence will show that Swindall, seeking an $850,000 loan, was
told the deal violated banking laws, was told narcotics money was
involved and was urged to walk away by the undercover agent but
``never terminated the deal.''
   Swindall's attorneys argued that Swindall and the government
were both duped by a manipulative associate of the former
Republican congressman.
   Swindall is accused of lying under oath in early 1988 to a
federal grand jury investigating his dealings with Charles
LeChasney, an associate and convicted money launderer, and with
federal agent Mike Mullaney, who was posing as ``Mike Martinez,'' a
money broker for probable drug dealers.
   Gillen told jurors that the agent more than once told Swindall
that if he were troubled by the illegal nature of the proposed deal
he could walk away. ``The agent is almost beating him off with a
stick,'' the prosecutor said.
   Still, Swindall sought the money and even turned over to his
contractor a check for $150,000 before later canceling the loan
deal, Gillen said.
   Swindall ``did not give a damn where the money came from,''
Gillen said.
   In his opening argument, defense attorney Richard Hendrix said
LeChasney tried to fool Swindall into believing the deal was
legitimate.
   Hendrix said LeChasney repeatedly told Swindall that the deal
involved legitimate money coming from foreign investors while he
told Mullaney that Swindall was ``a crook.''
   Mullaney, the first witness called by the prosecution Thursday
afternoon, testified that LeChasney told him that the congressman
``didn't care where the money came from; he wanted at least
$750,000.''
   Mullaney also said he was interested in meeting Swindall to
investigate whether Swindall's plans to sell a $1 million note at a
discount for cash ``would lead to an evasion of his income taxes''
and violations of currency laws.
   Hendrix, however, told the jury that Swindall never agreed to
the deal, that he continued to shop for and ultimately acquired
other financing for his luxurious suburban home in Stone Mountain
and that the check he received from LeChasney was a separate
transaction he canceled after becoming suspicious.
   Swindall was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 counts of lying to a federal
grand jury, each of which carries a penalty of 10 months to five
years in prison.
   The two-term congressman lost his 4th District seat in Atlanta's
eastern suburbs to Democrat Ben Jones last November. An attempt at
a speedy trial before Election Day was aborted after two jurors
received Swindall campaign material in the mail.

   Rain that fell Thursday in southern Florida missed
a grass fire that has burned 81,100 acres of Everglades National
Park, and more flare-ups were reported, dashing firefighters' hopes
they could confine the blaze.
   ``The southwest corner is giving us problems this evening,''
said park spokeswoman Pat Tolle. ``There was rain, and a little bit
of hail, but also lightning.''
   About 250 firefighters from as far away as California have
fought the blaze, which was started by lightning May 16 in the
region's worst fire season in a decade, she said. About 60
firefighters returned to fire lines Thursday to tend hot spots and
secure fire lines.
   Officials earlier predicted the fire would move toward a sparse
area with poor fuel, and had not expected any lightning.
   ``The direction it's going is very sparse and poor fuel, and
it's also wetter in that area so we're very optimistic we're just
going to be able to put a circle around it,'' Ms. Tolle said.
   While showers fell 30 miles to the northeast in the Miami area,
no rain fell on the fire, which is located in marshy sawgrass and
isolated hardwood hammocks that hadn't burned in more than 30 years.
   The blaze is typical of fires before the rainy season in the
vast park and has caused only limited damage, Ms. Tolle said.
   ``It's burning off the top of the grass,'' she said. ``We'll
see, as soon as the summer rains begin, there'll be a lush regrowth
of the sawgrass.''
   The fire briefly threatened the Miccosukee Indian village at the
northern edge of the park Tuesday before shifting direction, but
the park's nearby Shark Valley visitor center was closed until
Thursday morning because of heavy smoke.
   State officials estimate about 400 wildfires have consumed
350,000 acres of grass and brush in South Florida since October.
   ``Probably as far as acreage lost, this will end up topping the
others'' in this decade, said David Utley, state Forestry Division
district administrator. He estimated two-thirds of the fires have
been caused by man.

   Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale
has scheduled a news conference Friday to discuss the 1990 race for
the U.S. Senate seat in Minnesota, his son said Thursday.
   Mondale aides would not disclose whether the former senator from
Minnesota and 1984 Democratic presidential nominee will indicate
whether he plans to seek the seat now held by Republican Rudy
Boschwitz.
   The 7:15 a.m. news conference ``will have something to do with
the U.S. Senate race,'' said Ted Mondale. ``It will be worth
covering.''
   Mondale, a protege of the late Hubert H. Humphrey, generally is
considered the most formidable candidate Democrats could field
against Boschwitz.
   Prominent Minnesota Democrats said they did not know what
Mondale would announce.
   DFL Gov. Rudy Perpich, who a few weeks ago publicly urged
Mondale to decide soon on the Senate race, said Mondale has not
told him whether he will run.
   ``I don't have any idea, I really don't,'' Perpich said.
   He said he discussed the Senate race privately with Mondale two
days ago.
   Mondale, 61, represented Minnesota in the Senate from 1965 until
1976, when he gave up his seat to become vice president under
President Carter.
   Speculation that Mondale might run for the Senate again began in
June 1987, when he moved back to Minnesota from Washington. He is
an attorney with a Minneapolis law firm.
   Boschwitz, 58, was elected to the Senate in 1978.
   The only Democratic Senate candidate to date is Paul Wellstone,
a political science professor at Carleton College in Northfield and
a member of the Democratic National Committee.

<HEAD>Trainmaster Says Wrong Engineer Took Charge Before Derailment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The engineer who decided to stop a freight
train on a steep slope and disconnect the locomotives, causing a
derailment and explosion, didn't have the authority to do so, a
railroad official testified Thursday.
   Michael Lemm, Montana Rail Link's trainmaster at Helena, said
engineer Robert Estes was not in charge of the 49-car train when he
ordered the engines detached and realigned because the lead
locomotive had lost power and heat.
   Lemm testified on the second day of a National Transportation
Safety Board hearing into an accident that knocked out electricity
in Helena on Feb. 2, when it was 27 degrees below zero and the wind
chill was about 70 below.
   Estes was engineer of three ``helper'' locomotives assigned to
assist the train over the mountains at the Continental Divide. Jody
McCloud, engineer of the train itself, did not want to realign the
locomotives, but did not challenge Estes' decision. He offered to
run the train from the cold lead locomotive, but Estes rejected the
idea.
   While the locomotives were detached, the train began rolling
down the track 11 miles into Helena where it collided with other
locomotives. Several cars derailed and two carrying hydrogen
peroxide and isopropyl alcohol were involved in an explosion that
shattered windows for miles and severed power lines.
   About 3,500 residents were evacuated, but there were no serious
injuries. Damage has been estimated at $10 million.
   The disagreement between Estes and McCloud was detailed in
testimony by the two men Wednesday. Lemm was quizzed about the
issue Thursday.
   ``I believe Mr. McCloud was in charge of that train,'' he told
NTSB officials.
   While Estes may have been controlling the train from his
``helper'' locomotive, McCloud was responsible for the train itself
and had the discretion to assume control, Lemm said.
   Also testifying Thursday was Fritz Zettel, hazardous materials
specialist for the Helena Fire Department. He complained of
problems in obtaining details on the cargo in some of the derailed
cars.
   He also recounted problems the city had with emergency
communications during the power outage, and said the railroad
should involve city officials more in developing their plans for
train accidents.
   The final NTSB report on the accident is not expected until late
this year.

<TEXT>
   Sharon Rogers, the Navy skipper's wife who
narrowly escaped injury in the bombing of her van, said Thursday
that the incident showed terrorism knows no boundaries.
   ``It made us all realize that no nation or people can be immune
from terrorist activity, whatever the source,'' Mrs. Rogers said in
a speech to a fund-raising luncheon of San Diego Crime Stoppers.
   Mrs. Rogers said she understood many people stood on the street
and stared at her burned-out van and asked, ``How could it happen?
How could it happen here?''
   ``That's what a terrorist wants us to do, to create unreasoned
fear, isolation ... and forced modification of our lifestyles,''
Mrs. Rogers said. ``But determination in our hearts to ensure that
this does not occur turns a terrorist victory into defeat. A
unified community is an aware community and the execution of crime
becomes much more difficult.''
   Mrs. Rogers, who has made few public appearances since the March
10 bombing, was among five women whose lives have been torn by
violent crime to address the luncheon.
   Crime Stoppers is administering the $40,000 reward fund
established in the case of the van bombing, which occurred at a San
Diego intersection as Mrs. Rogers drove to work alone. She got out
just as flames engulfed the vehicle.
   Authorities suspect the attack may have been in retaliation for
the mistaken downing last July of an Iranian airliner by the USS
Vincennes, commanded by Capt. Will C. Rogers III.
   All 290 people aboard the jetliner were killed when the
Vincennes, engaged in a surface skirmish with Iranian gunboats,
fired two missiles at what it thought was an attacking Iranian
fighter jet.
   Mrs. Rogers did not discuss her dismissal from her teaching job
at a private school whose officials were worried students and staff
might be caught in terrorism's crossfire. Mrs. Rogers accepted a
$135,000 cash settlement from the school in exchange for leaving
the job she held for 12 years, but says she wants to continue
teaching and is looking for a job.
   Her husband is scheduled to be relieved as Vincennes skipper in
change of command ceremonies Saturday. Rogers' new assignment is at
the Navy's Tactical Training Group on Point Loma.

   Seabrook nuclear power plant officials
expressed joy Thursday on winning approval to split their first
atoms within two weeks, after a decade of delays and billions of
dollars in cost overruns.
   Plant foes, who lost a three-year battle to block low-power
testing, promised to press their legal battle against commercial
operation of the $6 billion plant.
   ``We still have a long fight ahead of us,'' said Massachusetts
Attorney General James Shannon, whose state played a key role in
stalling Seabrook by refusing to cooperate in evacuation planning
for it.
   The anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance, which has organized
demonstrations against Seabrook since the first trees were cleared
in 1976, continued preparing for a major rally the first weekend in
June, possibly coinciding with the first atomic chain reaction at
the reactor.
   A federal appeals court in Washington on Thursday rejected
Seabrook foes' request to delay the tests, and the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said it would issue the low-power license
Friday morning.
   Seabrook officials said they would start preparing for the tests
as soon as they got the license, and could be ready to start
nuclear fission about 10 days later.
   Edward Brown, president of Seabrook operator New Hampshire
Yankee, said the low-power license ``marks a milestone for Seabrook
Station and forecasts a promising energy future for all of New
England.''
   Most of the plant's 1,400 workers had already gone home by the
time the court ruled, Seabrook spokesman Ron Sher said, ``but for
those people seen here there were certainly a lot of smiles and
congratulations.''
   New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg, who conditionally supports
Seabrook, reiterated his belief that starting low-power tests
before commercial operation is assured ``is probably not a good
business decision.''
   ``They should wait until they're closer to a final disposition
on the full-power license,'' Gregg said in a telephone interview.
``There are still a lot of legal challenges still lying in the road
as well as some major decisions to be made by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission'' and its licensing board.
   But Gregg said he did not take legal action to try to block the
tests because lead Seabrook owner Public Service Company of New
Hampshire has agreed not to charge ratepayers any costs associated
with the tests.
   In a statement, the Clamshell Alliance said Gregg ``does not yet
fully realize the political burden he must now carry for his
complicit silence in allowing this radioactive testing to occur,
nor do any of us fully realize the environmental burden we will
pass on to future generations with the radioactive waste, for which
there is no known disposal.''
   About 10 Clamshell members, holding signs saying ``Stop Seabrook
Now,'' gathered outside Seabrook's gates as the court issued its
ruling.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis complained that ``the plant
will now be contaminated even though the NRC has made no final
decision on the adequacy of the Seabrook evacuation plan.''
   ``There is still no adequate plan to evacuate people in the
event of an accident, nor is there any evidence that such a plan
can even be produced,'' Dukakis said in a statement in Boston.

   The first competitively elected Soviet congress
today nominated maverick Boris N. Yeltsin and several prominent
reformers to be representatives in a smaller, full-time lawmaking
body.
   The moves came in the second day of debate in the 2,250-member
Congress of People's Deputies, which itself is the latest step in
the nation's experiment with democratic reform.
   Only one member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo appeared
on a congressional list of nominees for the smaller legislature,
the Supreme Soviet, assuring an overhaul of its traditional makeup.
   The congress, in the first day of its inaugural session,
Thursday reaffirmed its predecessor's choice of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev as president. He ran unopposed.

   U.S. officials say they hope immediate trade
talks can open markets in Japan, Brazil and India and avert any
backlash in those countries over being named to the
administration's list of top trade violators.
   ``This exercise is not intended to be offensive,'' U.S. Trade
Representative Carla A. Hills told a news conference Thursday night
as she announced the administration is targeting those countries
for priority action under the 1988 trade law. ``I hope there is no
backlash.''
   The 1988 Omnibus Trade Act requires the administration to issue
what amounts to a hit list that names the countries whose trade
barriers are most harmful to American producers. The government
then has 18 months to negotiate away the barriers.
   Failure of the talks could lead for tariffs of up to 100 percent
on selected exports from the offending countries.

   House Democrats, anticipating a historic
resignation next week of Speaker Jim Wright, are making plans for
quickly promoting Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley of Washington to
the powerful speaker's post.
   But intrigue is brewing for filling in the rest of the party
leadership slots as some Democrats worry that Rep. Tony Coelho,
Foley's likely successor, could hurt the party because of questions
about his own financial dealings.
   Foley, talking with reporters Thursday in Seattle, said he spoke
to Wright earlier in the day and the speaker ``repeated his desire
to have an opportunity to state his case, his side of the case, to
the widest possible audience, and he's determined to take that
opportunity at the first time that seems appropriate.''
   ``I assume that will be with either next week or shortly
thereafter,'' Foley said.

   A gasoline pipeline exploded and
killed three people just days after residents were assured it had
not been damaged by a runaway train that plowed through the same
neighborhood two weeks ago.
   ``It looks like a bomb went off over Duffy Street,'' City
Attorney James Penman said after the Thursday morning blast that
sent flames 300 feet skyward and produced heat so intense that pets
and corn stalks were singed two blocks away.
   Thirty-one people were injured in the explosion that also
destroyed 10 homes and 18 cars. About 300 people were ordered to
leave their homes for the night.
   ``It's like a nightmare,'' said Delores Jones, whose house was
destroyed by the fire. ``I haven't slept since the train wreck.
It's come back to haunt me.''

   Former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce
provoked anger and disbelief among members of a congressional panel
that questioned him about a housing subsidy program which
investigators say was riddled with favoritism.
   Pierce, who is now a New York lawyer, told congressional
investigators Thursday that he wasn't directly involved in deciding
which projects received grants under the program. He said a
committee of his subordinates at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development selected the winners, and his approval was a
rubber stamp.
   Pierce said he wasn't influenced by well-connected Republicans
and former HUD officials who obtained a large portion of the
multimillion-dollar subsidy projects, acting as consultants or
developers.
   ``Perhaps we should have watched the program closer than we
did,'' Pierce said, in the closest he came to acknowledging any
blame. ``But we've got a whole department (to run) ....''

   A miniature city built 75 years ago as a
play town for a businessman's daughter opens Saturday after a
sprucing up, and its operators hope it will once again be a top
tourist attraction.
   Tiny Town is located about five miles southwest of Denver and
boasts more than 70 buildings. Many are miniature replicas of
Denver historical buildings such as the city's first fire station,
the first telephone office, Mrs. Murphy's Boarding House, some
landmark mansions and some businesses.
   Twenty of the buildings _ most of which are little taller than
an adult's waist _ are the originals that George Turner built for
his daughter as a fantasy village beginning in 1915.
   On a hillside across Turkey Creek from the main village are
several replicas of old mining structures similar to those still in
place around such historical mining towns as Central City and
Cripple Creek.

<TEXT>
   Before Martika could even speak, she was
thinking about singing and dancing.
   ``I feel like I've done it before, probably in a previous life''
explained the 20-year-old singer and actress, who has released her
self-titled debut album. ``I think when I came out ofmy mother's
womb I was ready to be a performer. Most people don't have that. I
can never explain why. God only knows.''
   Born Marta Marrero, she began dance classes at 4 and was soon
giving recitals at school. Martika, the daughter of Cuban
immigrants, also paid close attention to the new phenonema of music
videos on television.
   ``Yeah, it was big,'' she recalled. ``I grew up on MTV. When I
was 14, MTV was taking off. That's when I got into pop. Culture
Club, Duran Duran and Madonna came out.''
   Impatient to break into show business, Martika was calling
agents at age 11; she had no interest in pursuing a conventional
career.
   ``I have friends who say, `I hate my job. I wish I could do
something else.' I say, `Go do it.' I really believe you should
follow your heart even if you have to go through rough times.
   ``I know I wanted it badly enough, I would have starved for it.
Better that than making a lot of money in an office and being
unhappy for the rest of my life.''
   Rock singer Madonna would prove to be a major influence on the
aspiring star, who admired her determination to succeed.
   ``Madonna's been really inspirational for me because she took
herself from nothing to the hugest female pop star alive. She
introduced the whole dance music scene. She paved the way for the
rest of us. People still don't take her seriously, but she's still
making records.''
   Martika also chose to professionally use just one name, but
denied getting the idea from Madonna. Afterall, Cher had done it
before.
   ``Even when I was younger, I thought it would be cool to have
one name, to have a unique name like Martika,'' the singer said.
``I started using it when I was 16. I was acting, and my agent said
I should save having one name for my recording career. Casting
directors would complain to the agencies that I didn't have a last
name.''
   Martika landed a minor role in the 1982 film version of
``Annie.'' She went on to appear on several television shows,
including ``Silver Spoons,'' ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' ``Hardcastle &amp;
McCormick'' and the children's variety series, ``Kids
Incorporated.''
   When she turned 18, she set her sights on the music industry,
spending a year preparing songs with producer-writer Michael Jay
(Miami Sound Machine, Stephanie Mills). She needed just two months
to record the album, a collection of dance tracks and ballads.
   The first single, ``More Than You Know,'' reached the Top 20,
but Martika's favorite song on the album is the anti-drug ``Toy
Soldiers,'' which she wrote herself.
   ``I was a little hesitant because I had only written two songs
before and they were light songs. I came up to Michael and said I
wanted to write about drugs. It was the first time I got the nerve
to write about something that was scary for me to talk about, so I
did,'' she said.
   Martika wrote the song about a friend who had been addicted to
cocaine.
   ``He can't listen to it,'' she said. ``It gives him the chills.
He says it affects him too much. He knows it's about him. He loves
it. he thinks it's a beautiful song, but when he listens to my
record, he skips over that.''
   Martika also does a dance version of Carole King's ``I Feel the
Earth Move.'' The young singer was just 3 when King's classic
``Tapestry'' album was released and knew little about her work.
   ``I listened to the melody once and put it away because I didn't
want to be influenced by her performance. I wanted to do it my
way,'' she said. ``Doing a remnake, you get the opportunity to
revive something for the older generation but you can also
introduce a great old song to kids who never knew it existed.''
   Fans should be warned that Martika does not expect to stay in
music very long. Although she considers singing her first great
love, Martika would eventually like to concentrate on movies.
   ``I think an actor can grow old a bit more gracefully,'' she
explained. ``I see myself doing pop music while I have the energy
and then getting married and doing one film every year or two.
There are so many parts of me outside of Martika the singer.
There's a real person in here somewhere.''

   When Margie Moberg Wilson complained to
her husband about poor city services, he challenged her to do
something about it.
   The 49-year-old real estate agent, mother of five and
grandmother of five, now is nine months into a term as mayor of her
financially ailing hometown, a Mobile suburb suffering from nearly
two decades of white flight.
   Prichard's 38,000 residents _ 78 percent of them black _ have an
average income of $12,000 to $15,000. Unemployment is 13.5 percent,
compared with 11.5 percent a year ago. Its 800 units of public
housing have a waiting list and Wilson Avenue, the main street, is
lined with boarded-up businesses.
   ``I am determined to see this city cleaned up,'' said Mrs.
Wilson, who has urged residents to bring solutions, not complaints
to City Hall.
   Offsetting her determination is the cold reality of economics.
Prichard hasn't had a printed budget since 1972, but Jim Longino,
the finance director Mrs. Wilson hired, said it will be $488,000 in
the red this year. The city has been operating without insurance
since last year.
   ``When you ride through downtown Prichard, you see that there is
very little if any real type of retail or any other services that
are generating a taxable base that would allow the city to start to
grow again,'' said Floyd Pough, who works in a community assistance
program.
   Whites began moving out with the election of the first of three
black mayors, Democrat A. J. Cooper, in 1972. As whites moved out,
poor blacks from north Mobile began moving in. Cooper resigned in
1980, convinced that blacks had taken control of ``their own
destiny,'' which had been his goal.
   The ``mass exodus by whites that threw the situation out of
balance'' still continues, said the Rev. J.J. Phillips of Mount
Sinai Baptist Church. He said the challenge remains poverty and the
white flight that took business with it.
   ``Black people want the same things as whites _ nice homes, good
jobs,'' said Mrs. Wilson, who is white. She eked out a 3,144-3,050
victory over Jesse Norwood, a black Democrat, in a runoff election
in September after he defeated two-term GOP incumbent John Smith.
The job pays $35,000 a year.
   ``Prichard is still Prichard,'' regardless of who is mayor,
Phillips said.
   Real estate agent Paul Buchman, said Mrs. Wilson hasn't been in
office long enough to judge. ``She has on one or two occasions
mentioned some things, but they are in the formatives stages and
it's difficult to talk about.''
   It's not possible to counter poverty ``until such time as they
see some change in the neighborhood situation,'' Buchman said. Many
of the residents of a large part of the city are on welfare and
``most of the households are headed by women with children.''
Employed residents, including the new mayor, tend to live in the
part of the city known as Eight Mile.
   And regardless of who's in City Hall, he said, it must address
the areas that are ``drug-infested and have no money.
   ``The inner city is where the problem lies. Inner-city crime,
and I don't know how we're going to stop that.''
   Pough lived in Prichard for 27 years, but moved to Mobile in
1980 to buy a house that would not decline in value. ``Not many
people want to live in a city where you have a high rate of
unemployment, and you're not getting services from the city in
terms of police protection,'' he said.
   His agency can help the poor and homeless in the short term,
``but you get people who are out saying, `I need to work. Can you
help me?' ... Once you get people who can't find affordable
housing, and jobs that will pay them a decent salary to get off
welfare rolls, to work on a daily basis, they are trapped.''
   Residents expect to see some revitalization from the new
administration, said Pough. ``I guess what they're looking for is a
new beginning. From a black administration to a person who is
white, female, they are looking for something that's different from
the past.''

<HEAD>Poland and East Germany Agree to End Dispute at `Friendship Frontier'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East German claims to channel waters
off this lucrative Polish port have been fraying the ``frontier of
friendship'' that separates the East bloc neighbors since 1985 but
the door now is open to a solution.
   Poland and East Germany have signed an agreement to readjust
their borders with the aim of settling once and for all a dispute
that was given scant official public attention but became an open
secret on the piers of the Baltic coast.
   Because of the dispute, both sides put border guards in place on
the wide beach west of the port and signs warned strollers. Marking
buoys were set out in the channel, which winds back and forth from
the high seas to the port.
   The port of Swinoujscie straddles the narrow opening of a bay
that leads to Poland's largest port, Szczecin, 40 miles to the
south on the Odra (Oder in German) River.
   The conflict erupted after East Germany extended its territorial
waters to 12 miles from shore in 1985 and started to enforce its
claim to parts of the channel approach to Swinoujscie that had been
under Polish administration.
   The agreement aimed at solving the frictions was signed May 22
in East Berlin by the Polish and East German foreign ministers.
   Essentially, East Germany agreed to abandon most of its
territorial claims where they intersected the shipping lanes to and
from the Polish port. In exchange, East Germany gets fishing rights
in part of the bay.
   Only part of the westernmost approach to the bay will remain
waters of East Germany, which promises not to disturb Polish ship
traffic there.
   ``The agreement is a common success for both states,'' said the
chief Polish negotiator, Wladyslaw Napieraj, in an official
statement.
   A few years ago, East German coast guard cutters had closed in
on ships that allegedly strayed out of Polish waters, warning them
over bullhorns they were violating East German territory, said
Jozef Chabowski, a department director at the Polish shipping
company.
   ``We were facing the problem that East Germany said we were
operating on waters they claim don't belong to us, so the issue
must be settled. It was a show (of authority) from their side to
the ships,'' he said.
   But he added that the incidents have been less frequent in the
past year.
   The dispute arose at about the time Poland had made public plans
to open a duty-free zone in Swinoujscie-Szczecin, while East
Germany was investing heavily to build up its Baltic port at
Rostock, 80 miles to the west.
   Jozef Stebnicki of the maritime office that handles shipping
complaints said recreational sailing craft had been affected, and
Boleslaw Stolowicz, chairman of the Certa fish cooperative, said it
was a problem for deep-sea fishing companies.
   Talks at the highest level on the dispute took place last June
when Poland's Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski met Erich Honecker, the East
German leader, in the former German city of Wroclaw. A government
spokesman at that time said an agreement was near.
   ``We here in the western territories of Poland are especially
sensitive to these problems because of the most recent history,''
said Jerzy Timen, an editor at the Szczecin-based weekly newspaper
Morze I Ziemia (Sea and Earth).
   Timen, who has written extensively on the dispute, said Polish
authorities were not interested in heating up the conflict and that
officials censored articles in his newspaper that tried to put the
conflict in a national and international context.
   ``Everyone was talking about it, but articles didn't appear _
although you could sneak certain problems into professional or
factory publications,'' he said.
   But Polish underground newspapers from the area reported
extensively on the dispute and said that Polish vessels at one
point were being stopped and inspected by East Germans.
   Just after World War II, the area around Swinoujscie-Szczecin,
previously German, was turned over to Poland.
   The German towns of Swinemuende and Stettin became Swinoujscie
and Szczecin.
   Resident Germans were forced to leave, while Polish refugees
were moved in after having been expelled by the Soviet Union from
what before the war had been the eastern part of Poland.
   As relations between Poland and East Germany improved in the
1970s, Poles and East Germans only had to show national identity
cards to cross the border. Poles flocked to East Germany to shop at
its better stocked stores.
   But after the rise of the independent Solidarity trade union in
1980-81, East Germans required Poles to use passports and issued
Poles entrance visas only on the basis of an invitation.
   Now the majority of Germans in the restaurants and on the
beaches are tourists from West Berlin, only a two-hour drive away,
who benefit from the exchange rate that allows them, among other
things, to eat a first-rate dinner for the equivalent of only about
$10.

<HEAD>Portugal Still Wary of Spain, Although Ties Are Stronger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spain and Portugal. The names often are
said in one breath, and today there are even more reasons to group
the Iberian neighbors together.
   But many Portuguese dislike it.
   Feeling overshadowed by bigger, richer Spain, the Portuguese
point to the differences between them.
   ``There is a division, a looking at Spain as the enemy,'' said
Fernando Brito Soares, an economics professor at Lisbon's New
University. ``It's in the cultural background.''
   He cites an old Portuguese saying: ``De Espanha ni bom vento, ni
bom casamento'' _ From Spain, neither good wind nor good marriage.
   Said Nicholas Racich, an American banker who has lived in both
countries: ``There is always a sense of competition and wariness
among the Portuguese toward Spaniards.''
   Spaniard Jorge Hay, a director of Banco Hispano Americano in
Madrid, said: ``Portugal was always a bit obsessed with Spain. The
Portuguese always define themselves as something different than
Spain.''
   Spaniards don't seem to spend much time thinking about the
Portuguese, and Luis Campos e Cunha, another New University
professor, agrees.
   ``We talk much more about them than they talk about us.''
   The prejudices are typical of large and small neighbors: many
Portuguese think Spaniards are loud and overbearing; many Spaniards
think Portuguese are insecure and backward.
   Seafaring nations, Spain and Portugal traditionally have had
little to do with each other, although they share the Iberian
Peninsula, aren't divided by mountains or rivers, and don't need
passports to cross the border.
   ``Portugal was always a little country against a big one. During
centuries Portugal had to defend itself against the Spanish desire
to annex Portugal,'' said Fernando Barciela, a Madrid-based
correspondent for Portugal's main newspaper, Diaro de Noticias.
   Spain ruled Portugal for only 60 years, until 1640, but the
Portuguese have ``never gotten over that,'' Racich said.
   The Portuguese still boast that their country was the only
Iberian region ultimately to escape Castilian control.
   To escape Spanish domination, Portugal formed a strong bond with
England, and created a culture so independent of Spain that today
it remains almost impervious to its neighbor's influence, Barciela
said.
   But the relationship changed dramatically when the two joined
the European Economic Community in 1986.
   It forced traditionally protectionist Spain to start dropping
its trade barriers. That means Spain now buys more products from
others countries, including Portugal, whose trade-based economy
traditionally has been more open.
   With the approach of 1992, when the 12 nations of the EEC open
up trade among themselves, Spain has been investing more in
Portugal. It invested $119 million in Portugal in 1988, five times
the 1985 amount. Portuguese investment in Spain is still
insignificant.
   ``In five years' time, there will exist an Iberian economy, not
just a Spanish economy,'' said Francisco Capelo, director of
capital markets for Banco International do Funchal SA in Lisbon.
``I believe Iberia will be much more integrated.''
   Portuguese exports to Spain almost quadrupled to $1.3 billion in
1988 from 1985, while Spanish exports to Portugal almost trebled to
$2.2 billion, according to the Spanish government.
   Tourism has grown, with millions of travelers going in both
directions each year.
   But there are problems.
   It's still ``very difficult for any Portuguese product to get
into Spain,'' said Jaime de Lacerda, director of the Confederation
of Portuguese Industry.
   ``There are some fears that the Portuguese economy can be
swallowed by Spanish enterprises,'' he added. ``In Portugal, all
this Spanish investment is seen as dangerous from a point of view
of its identity.''
   Some Portuguese are worried that their government's new
privatization program will result in Spaniards buying up the
maximum foreign holdings allowed in the sales of state-owned
companies.
   Spain is about five times the size of Portugal. Its population
of 38.8 million is more than triple Portugal's. With per capita
gross domestic product of about $7,400, Spain is twice as
prosperous.
   ``In Spain, economically and in terms of mindset, they are 10
years ahead of Portugal,'' said Racich, the American banker.
``Madrid is a gleaming modern capital, Lisbon is a very large
village.''
   They also keep different hours. Both take long lunches but at
different times, which could be an annoyance in an intermeshed
economy. The Portuguese start theirs at 1 p.m. and return around
2:30 or 3. The Spaniards start at 2:30 and return at 4:30 or 5. The
Portuguese end the work day at 6 p.m. and the Spaniards around 7 or
8 p.m.
   The languages are very different. The Portuguese generally can
understand spoken Spanish, but most Spaniards can't understand
Portuguese.
   Portuguese radio plays Spanish music and the Portuguese who can
afford it have dishes that receive Spanish TV. But the fare of
Portuguese-speaking Brazil in South America is more popular.
   ``People have a misconception that Portugal is a macho
country,'' says Cunha.
   Portuguese women's participation in the work force is one of
Europe's highest, although primarily through menial agricultural
jobs, while Spanish women's is the lowest.
   A woman, Maria Pintasilgo, was briefly Portugal's prime minister
in 1979-1980.

<HEAD>Plans for Europe in 1992 Stirs Protest in French Caribbean</HEAD>

   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Western Europe's move toward a
single trading market by the end of 1992 has raised some concern on
Martinique and Guadeloupe, French islands 4,500 miles from Paris.
   A fear is that the elimination of trade barriers within the
12-nation European Economic Community will trigger an invasion of
wealthy land speculators and jobless immigrants that could threaten
the islands' Caribbean identity.
   On May 1, Labor Day, hundreds of trade unionists poured into the
streets of Fort-de-France, Martinique's capital, to voice their
concern over the ``dangers of European integration,'' as one
official put it.
   Protesters maintained that removing tariffs on European goods
coming into Martinique will stifle local production and the
unrestricted circulation of capital will make it easier for
Europeans to buy land and businesses on the island.
   Emmanuel Ibene, co-leader of the Guadeloupean Communist Party,
said, ``A new status is being imposed on us, and nobody has asked
our opinion.''
   Guadeloupe and Martinique, about 150 miles apart halfway down
the arc of the Lesser Antilles, are French overseas departments.
They are as much a part of France as Hawaii is of the United States.
   Bakeries, Parisian accents, compact Citroen cars, cyclists
wearing flashy racing tights training on picturesque rural roads
all resemble France.
   Many ``metropolitans,'' as the European French are called, own
small shops and restaurants on the two islands. European drifters
peddle jewelry on street corners or sing and play guitars at
sidewalk cafes.
   With 500,000 resettled French West Indians, France itself is
influenced by Caribbean culture. Every islander has relatives or
friends in France, and their music, ``zouk,'' similar to calypso,
has millions of fans.
   Being French, the islands are part of the European Economic
Community. Air travelers arriving here line up under customs signs
that read in French ``non-EEC citizens'' and ``EEC citizens.'' The
latter need no passports.
   A single European market with no travel, employment or residency
restrictions would open the floodgates to immigration, opponents
say.
   ``There are 23 million unemployed in Europe; it only takes half
a million to immigrate here and we're finished,'' said Claude
Makouke, leader of the small separatist Popular Union for the
Liberation of Guadeloupe.
   ``The danger for Guadeloupe of remaining French is our cultural
disappearance through intermixing with Europeans,'' Makouke said.
``For us, 1992 is the `coup de grace.'''
   Most of the 680,000 residents of Martinique and Guadeloupe are
of African descent, with a sprinkling of East Indians and Europeans.
   Not everybody is opposed to a single European market. The
regional assemblies of both islands favor the idea.
   ``Every Martiniquan should plant a banana tree for Europe,
because the market is there,'' said Pierre Petit, leader of the
island's rightists and mayor of the mountain town of Morne Rouge.
``Europe is what we need to lift us out of our torpor.''
   French West Indians enjoy a high standard of living, receiving
free health care and generous unemployment benefits. But 25 percent
of the work force is unemployed and 30 percent have government
jobs. The French state is the main source of income, followed by
banana exports and tourism.
   ``People think that in 1992 we're going to see fleets of 747s
flying in here packed with wealthy West Germans coming to buy up
all the business,'' said Pierre-Luc St. Yves, a Credit Martiniquais
Bank manager. ``We're already part of the EEC. The Germans could
have come long ago.''
   Yet, many islanders are alarmed at the quantity of farm land
bought by European investors to build villas and hotels. They also
fear the abolition in 1992 of a special tax on goods imported from
France. Towns here draw 50 percent of their revenues from the tax.
   Even EEC advocates like Petit and St. Yves argue that measures
must be taken to preserve the tax and protect real estate from
European speculators.
   Support for integration with France dates to the French
Revolution of 1789. Newly freed slaves saw alliance with the
revolutionary government in Paris as a weapon against the local
elite.
   Residents of Martinique, Guadeloupe and French Guiana, France's
other overseas department, on the northern shoulder of South
America, vote in French elections and elect deputies and senators
to the National Assembly in Paris.
   Since Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, was elected president of
France in 1981 and turned over powers to local assemblies, the
French Caribbean islands have been run by their regional councils.
They control their own budgets, development projects, cultural
programs and tourism.
   Decentralization undercut support for independence, still
unpopular despite anxiety over the EEC of 1992.
   ``Our demand to have our cultural identity recognized has often
been misinterpreted as a desire for independence,'' said Camille
Darsiere, president of Martinique's Regional Assembly.
   While independence is a non-issue in Martinique, a small but
vocal separatist movement simmers in Guadeloupe, where a rash of
bombings in the early 1980s killed eight people and ended with the
1984 arrest of separatist militant Luc Reinette.
   ``Independence is losing ground. The word is used just to be
heard,'' said Lucette Michaux-Chevry, deputy in the French National
Assembly and leader of Guadeloupe's rightists. ``We are a success
story. Whether you like it or not, the French experiment worked
here.''

   Today is Friday, May 26, the 146th day of 1989. There are 219
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On May 26, 1868, the Senate impeachment trial of President
Andrew Johnson ended with his acquittal by votes of 35-16 on each
of the charges against him, falling one vote short of a two-thirds
majority.
   On this date:
   In 1521, Martin Luther was banned by the Edict of Worms because
of his religious beliefs and writings.
   In 1805, Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned king of Italy.
   In 1865, arrangements were made in New Orleans for the surrender
of Confederate forces west of the Mississippi.
   In 1913, Actors' Equity Association was organized.
   In 1940, the evacuation of Allied troops began from Dunkirk,
France.
   In 1960, U.N. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge accused the Soviets
of hiding a microphone inside a wood carving of the Great Seal of
the United States that had been given as a gift to the U.S. Embassy
in Moscow.
   In 1969, the Apollo 10 astronauts returned safely to Earth after
a successful eight-day dress rehearsal for the first manned moon
landing.
   In 1977, George H. Willig scaled up the side of the South Tower
of New York's World Trade Center, using equipment he designed and
built. Willig was arrested at the top of the 110-story building.
   In 1978, the first legal casino in the eastern United States
opened in Atlantic City, N.J.
   In 1981, 14 people were killed when a Marine jet crashed onto
the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz off Florida.
   Ten years ago: President Anwar Sadat of Egypt received a
tumultous welcome as he visited Sinai, which Israel had agreed to
give up.
   Five years ago: Authorities found a homemade bomb in La Crosse,
Wis., after five similar devices had turned up in several other
Midwestern communities. A former mental patient was later charged
with planting the bombs.
   One year ago: The National Hockey League's Edmonton Oilers
completed a four-game sweep of the Boston Bruins to capture their
fourth Stanley Cup in five seasons.
   Today's Birthdays: Actor Robert Morley is 81. Actor Peter
Cushing is 76. Singer Peggy Lee is 69. Actor James Arness is 66.

<HEAD>Impressionist Joe Alaskey Is Virtually Everybody on TV</HEAD>

   Once a week Joe Alaskey is Beano on ``Out of
This World,'' but the rest of the time he's virtually everyone else
on television.
   He plays Donna Pescow's annoying brother, Beano Froelich, in the
syndicated sitcom. He also appears daily on the syndicated game
show ``Couch Potatoes,'' and you never know who he's going to be.
   The versatile actor-writer-impressionist does voices of
characters from Dr. Zorba on ``Ben Casey'' to Marlin Perkins of
``Wild Kingdom'' to Earl Hamner, the creator-narrator of ``The
Waltons.'' Frequently, he's in costume and makeup on ``Couch
Potatoes,'' or he may simply appear as himself, ``The Neighbor.''
   He was the voice of Yosemite Sam in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit''
and is on the CBS cartoon show ``The New Adventures of Mighty
Mouse.''
   His personal favorite is Jackie Gleason. Alaskey hopes to appear
as ``The Great One'' in a film biography.
   ``I've been impersonating Gleason for years,'' he said. ``I even
look a lot like him. I only worked with him once. When the `lost
episodes' of `The Honeymooners' were found Viacom hired me to loop
his voice on some of the bad sound tracks. I had to do it as
Gleason sounded in the 1950s.
   ``Gleason picked me from listening to me on tape,'' Alaskey
said, ``I also appeared as Ralph Kramden in a `Honeymooners' sketch
on a Suzanne Somers special.''
   As Beano Froelich on ``Out of This World,'' Alaskey is often the
butt of the jokes.
   ``I'm in on the secret that her daughter, Evie, has special
powers because her father is a space alien,'' he said. ``I'm the
only other member of the cast who knows, so I'm in all the ploys to
keep it a secret.
   ``I'm generally the brunt of Evie's magic. She'll turn me into a
sheep dog or a 10-year-old kid. Or I may just stay his grouchy,
spoiled self.''
   Maureen Flannigan stars as Evie and Doug McClure plays the mayor.
   Alaskey has lost 80 pounds since starting ``Out of This World''
in September 1987. The 6-foot-1 actor now weighs 255 pounds. ``I'm
still losing,'' he said. ``I'll be able to play big guys instead of
big fat guys. I'll be more presentable as an actor and stand up
comic.''
   The situation comedy was the first show Alaskey auditioned for
when he moved here from Boston. He had been a
comedian-impressionist on a morning show on radio station WVBF and
worked in Boston as a standup comic.
   ``I got to L.A. when Bill Scott was on a tour for the 25th
anniversary of `Rocky and Bullwinkle,''' he said. ``He came to
Boston and we did some sketches on the radio show. Bill's the voice
of Bullwinkle. I did Boris Badenov and William Conrad, the
announcer. Bill said I did the best version of the voices he had
heard.
   ``He said if I came to Los Angeles he'd help me find work. He
was true to his word. He not only found me work but even moved me
into my apartment. Then before I knew it I was on David Letterman's
show. That got me all kinds of offers from agents. Then I was an
actor again.''
   He recently starred in the movie ``Lucky Stiff'' and was the
voice of Dr. Ziplock in another movie, ``Martians!''
   Alaskey is writing two one-man shows, one an exploration of
human needs called ``Q&amp;A,'' and one called ``An Evening with Joe
Alaskey.'' He's also writing and drawing a cartoon book of
palindromes, which are words that are spelled the same forward and
backward. Examples: ``Madam, I'm Adam'' and ``Sir, I'm Iris.''

<HEAD>Eddie Peck Has Roles on Competing Prime-Time Soap Operas</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not unusual for an actor to appear
regularly on two television shows, but J. Eddie Peck had pivotal
roles on two competing prime-time soap operas, CBS' ``Dallas'' and
ABC's ``Dynasty.''
   On ``Dallas,'' he plays George Kennedy's bad-boy son, Tommy
McKay, and on the just-canceled ``Dynasty'' he was Roger Grimes,
the mysterious dream-lover of Emma Samms and a nightmare from Joan
Collins' past.
   Peck has been notified by Lorimar Productions that he'll be back
next season on ``Dallas.'' ABC is dropping ``Dynasty'' after nine
seasons.
   Peck auditioned for ``Dynasty'' last year, but because of the
writers strike he went to Las Cruces, N.M., to work in a movie
called ``The Bite.'' He calls it a cross between ``Alien'' and
``The Fly.''
   ``I'd written off `Dynasty,' but when I got back they called me
in,'' said Peck. ``They still hadn't written the role, but he was
to be Joan Collins' ex-lover who was murdered 25 years ago. I
played him as he was 25 years ago. I would come to Emma Samms in
her dreams as her lover.
   ``Then I had a chance to audition for `Dallas.' I only had a
week-to-week contract with `Dynasty' and they wouldn't tell me what
was going to happen. After I got hired by `Dallas' I was called
back to `Dynasty.' The people at `Dallas' didn't want to let me go
and I did eight shows. It was on my resume that I was on `Dynasty'
but they apparently missed it. The two shows don't want to share
actors.''
   Peck was supposed to do only four shows for ``Dynasty,'' but
ended up doing seven.
   Peck said he particularly likes his character on ``Dallas''
because of his many facets.
   ``He's a wild, wild man,'' he said. ``He has a lot of pain, a
lot of anguish. He has a bitter relationship with his father. You
see a sympathetic level beneath the dark side. I really took the
character out on a limb. There's a rage and frustration they didn't
originally intend. But once I tried it they liked it and started
writing it that way.''
   In the beginning, Peck didn't want to be an actor, but says
eventually, ``I fell in love with it.''
   His first roles were in the daytime soaps ``The Young and the
Restless'' and ``Days of Our Lives.'' Later he had a recurring role
in an NBC show, ``Double Trouble.''
   Four years ago he was cast in an ABC Western series called
``Wildside.'' It ran for only six episodes in 1985, up against
NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and CBS' ``Magnum P.I.''
   ``It was a Disney show and Disney treated us first class,'' he
said. ``They spoiled us. I didn't know everybody else doesn't get
this kind of treatment. It was a turning point in a lot of ways.''
   Peck, who was born in Virginia and grew up in Missouri, is
married to Sonya Zaza Peck, a high-fashion runway model.

<HEAD>The Voices of America: From Groucho to Gullahs, It's All On Tape</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Sam Waterston listened to the tapes to
prepare for his role as Abraham Lincoln in a TV movie. A Florida
woman heard the voices of her great-grandmothers on the tapes
regarded as a priceless scholarly record of the voices of America.
   The accents of Americans, famous and ordinary, from Groucho Marx
and Eleanor Roosevelt to Arkansas sharecroppers, New York's Puerto
Rican teen-agers, Serbian ironworkers from Minnesota, Chesapeake
Bay watermen and Gullahs from coastal South Carolina, are preserved
on 250 hours of tapes in the archives of the Library of Congress.
   Among the treasures are the rarely heard voice of vanished
aviator Amelia Earhart; the story of an 1869 whaling voyage told by
a Nantucket, Mass., seafarer; an elderly Maine lady reciting her
watermelon rind recipe; and the first American recording by
Alistair Cooke, a caustic young British drama student in 1934 who
describes his loathing of Hollywood.
   The dialect recordings are housed in the library's American
Folklife Center. The center's Archive of Folk Culture contains more
than 35,000 hours of audio cylinders, discs, wires and tapes and
more than 100,000 pages of manuscripts of songs, instrumental
music, folk tales, oral histories and other forms of American
cultural expression.
   The first major collection was donated to the folklife center in
1984 by the American Dialect Society, a professional organization
of linguistic scholars. It consists of 1,300 aluminum, 78-rpm discs
of regional American speech _ 132 hours in all _ that were recorded
in the early 1930s by field workers for a projected linguistic
atlas of North America.
   The library is nearing completion of the time-consuming task of
transferring those recordings from discs to standard 10-inch,
double-track Mylar tapes for permanent storage.
   Then, in 1986, the Center for Applied Linguistics, a non-profit
Washington education and research organization, donated an 118-hour
sampler of American dialects drawn from previously inaccessible
private collections.
   Those tapes were compiled from scattered private holdings by the
center's project director, Donna Christian, with the help of a
$79,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.
   The Library of Congress called her tape collection, which took
more than two years to assemble, ``an aural kaleidoscope of the
American experience.''
   Gerald Parsons, reference librarian at the American Folklife
Center, said the tapes are ``a gold mine for genealogical
purposes'' because the 1930s recordings frequently included
ordinary people talking informally about their home territory,
complete with family names, birth dates and burial sites.
   One woman visitor from Florida appeared at the center recently
to inquire about elderly relatives, now dead, who were supposed to
have been interviewed and recorded by famed folklorist John Lomax
about 50 years ago.
   ``Within five or 10 minutes, she was sitting here with
earphones, listening to the voices of her two great-grandmothers,''
Parsons said.
   As part of his research for the role of Lincoln in the NBC
mini-series, ``Gore Vidal's Lincoln'' in March 1988, Sam Waterston
spent two days at the folklife center listening to 1940s recordings
of natives of the Smoky Mountains.
   No one knows exactly what Lincoln sounded like, Parsons said, so
Waterston sought clues from the speech patterns of people from
eastern Kentucky. Lincoln was reared in Kentucky in the 1820s by
immigrant parents, but his speech probably was influenced more
strongly in those formative years by his western Virginia mother
than his father's Massachusetts forebears.
   ``Sam listened to the Smoky Mountain samples, knowing full well
they were not carbon copies of what Lincoln spoke, but our best
guess was that they were as close as you can come today to his
mother's speech,'' Parsons said.
   Ms. Christian and Walt Wolfram, her research associate at the
Center for Applied Linguistics, said in an interview that America's
regional dialects remain strong and distinctive today.
   They agreed that the homogenizing influence of television and
easy mobility have diluted some of the peculiarities of speech in
isolated regions such as Appalachia, where expressions like ``I'm
a-going'' and ``hit's a nice day'' are heard less often.
   But the Southern dialect, once deliberately softened to make it
more socially acceptable, is enjoying a resurgence in the
cosmopolitan ``New South'' where being a Dixie native is a source
of newfound pride, they noted.
   Likewise, they said, natives of Martha's Vineyard and other New
England vacation spots are emphasizing their distinctive speech to
retain their identity amid hordes of summertime visitors.
   Don't let all those look-alike strips along the interstate
highways fool you, Wolfram said. ``There's a certain deceptiveness
to what looks alike,'' he said. ``The guy behind the counter at
McDonald's in Pennsylvania will say, `Have a good day,' and the guy
in Arkansas will still say `Have a good-un'.''

<HEAD>Florida Abortion-Consent Law Collides With Growing Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IKE FLORES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAVARES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 15-year-old girl was defiant.
   ``Just because you tell me I can't have an abortion doesn't mean
I'm going to go home and tell my mom,'' she told the judge. ``I'm
going to another court.''
   The teen-ager was preparing an appeal with a legal services
lawyer but was spared the fight when an appeals court overturned
the state's abortion-consent law in a case involving another
central Florida girl, identified only as T.W.
   After hopscotching up to the U.S. Supreme Court and back, T.W.'s
case is now before Florida's highest court for a June 27 hearing on
whether the state can constitutionally require unmarried minors to
get parental or judicial consent for an abortion.
   T.W. is believed to have received an abortion after the law was
put on hold, but neither she nor her lawyer, Jerri Blair, would
discuss her condition.
   The new Florida law has focused attention on teen-age pregnancy
and on the difficulties in adding legal restrictions for minors'
abortions.
   Ruth Arick, director of the Birth Control Center in Orlando,
used the case of the defiant 15-year-old girl to illustrate those
difficulties.
   That girl and a 16-year-old who got an abortion the same day had
been denied under-age ``waivers'' by judges, Ms. Arick said.
   ``We had told them that with all the ups and downs in the
courtrooms to just hang in there,'' said Ms. Arick, who described
the younger girl as ``very persistent,'' an only daughter whose
parents had considered her a perfect child who could do no wrong.
   ``She felt that if they found out about her pregnancy, they
would not trust her ever again and limit her activities the rest of
the time she was in that house,'' Ms. Arick said.
   Dr. Alfred H. Moffett, who delivered babies in nearby Leesburg
for 16 years until quitting obstetrics earlier this year, said
teen-age pregnancy is ``a major problem, both here in Lake County
and in many areas of the state. ... Everyone who practices
obstetrics sees 12-, 13- and 14-year-olds having babies.''
   Moffett said 25 percent to 30 percent of the indigent patients
he treated at Leesburg Regional Medical Center were minor,
unmarried girls.
   That is in line with estimates from abortion-rights activists,
who say minors received about a third of the 75,000 abortions
performed in Florida last year.
   ``Teen-age pregnancies are on the rise,'' Moffett said. ``We
don't need all kinds of statistics to know that. We need to teach
these young ladies what to do. That's why sex education in the
schools is so terribly important.''
   The primary reason for young pregnancies, Moffett believes, is a
lack of guidance at home, church and school.
   ``They don't know how or what to do and how to keep from getting
pregnant,'' he said. ``The moral implications are up to the family
and the church. But someone needs to teach them the mechanics.''
   In a report released May 24, the Southern Regional Project on
Infant Mortality said the South has a higher rate of teen-age
pregnancy than the rest of the nation and called for an intensified
education campaign aimed at boys as well as young girls.
   ``When our children have children, we all lose,'' said
Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus, co-chairman of the group.
   The report said Southern girls under age 17 accounted for 47
percent of the nation's 178,000 teen-age births in 1985 although
the region was home to just 37 percent of the girls in that age
group.
   Florida's consent law, which was enacted in February, required a
girl under 18 who did not have her parents' consent for an abortion
to go before a judge and convince him that her parents were
unreasonable in withholding consent or that she feared physical or
emotional abuse if she requested help from parents or a guardian.
Before that, a girl legally did not need anyone's permission,
although many hospitals, clinics and doctors required some type of
parental authorization.
   The consent law might have little effect from a practical
standpoint, said Dr. Samuel Barr, a gynecologist who is director of
the EPOC Clinic in the Orlando suburb of Maitland.
   ``Contrary to the right-to-life propaganda, most minors come
with their parents,'' Barr said. ``And the parents are as anxious,
if not more anxious, than their 12- or 13- or 15-year-old
daughter'' for an abortion.
   A 15-year-old who identified herself only as Sarah had an
abortion at the Birth Control Center in Orlando recently with her
mother's consent.
   ``It wouldn't have been as easy for some of my friends as it was
for me,'' because their parents would not have been as supportive,
she said.
   However, if her mother had not agreed, Sarah said, ``I don't
think it would have been worth going to the court or whatever I had
to do. Besides, it would have been like going behind my mother's
back.''
   At the BETA Center in Orlando, another 15-year-old, Cathy, spoke
fearfully about her problems.
   Seven months pregnant, she is saddened at having been
``disowned'' by her father although her mother would have agreed to
an abortion. She says she and her boyfriend will put the baby up
for adoption.
   ``I never thought of an abortion. ... The law didn't matter to
me,'' she said.
   But, she added, the pair never considered the consequences of
having a baby. They ``never thought about finishing school or the
money or anything,'' she said. ``That was just being selfish. We
probably would be living off welfare or something,'' if they had
decided to keep the child.
   That lack of knowledge and thought is why Moffett gives sex
education lectures at schools, church fellowships and youth
organizations.
   ``I just spoke to about 90 fifth-grade girls at Fruitland Park
about contraception, and the questions from the 10-, 11- and
12-year-old kids would just blow your socks off,'' he said.
   ``They ask about condoms and intercourse and the pill. ... These
children are getting the information, but they're getting it off
the playground.''
   Moffett said he feared the consequences of restrictive abortion
laws.
   ``What we're seeing are efforts to legislate away abortions,''
he said. ``They may be made legal or illegal, but they won't go
away. They may have to go underground again, and that's a bigger
tragedy. Then we will lose mothers as well as fetuses.''

   Four years ago, the Hartford Stage
Company was struggling with a huge deficit and a drastic decline in
ticket subscriptions.
   Today, thanks to some brilliant management and artistic
performances, the theater has not only rebounded with budget
surpluses and sold-out shows, but will receive a coveted Tony Award
as the outstanding regional theater in the country, when the
theater honors its own on June 4.
   Mark Lamos, Hartford Stage's 43-year-old artistic director now
in his ninth year at the theater, says the award recognizes a
quarter-century of theatrical achievement. But he admits that four
years ago, no matter how laudable the productions, the critics'
accolades probably would have gone unheard.
   ``I think when the theater began, the first two regimes of
artists and managers were not at all concerned about getting the
word out,'' Lamos said. ``There was a sense that we disdain any
sort of national opportunity, any sort of national recognition.
   ``That began to seem a little bit unrealistic to me. I thought,
`Here we have this beautiful new theater, we're doing work on a big
scale, we're ... in a highly competitive, charged atmosphere of
theater excellence. Well, let's be a part of that.'''
   Hartford Stage captured critics' attention with its modern
adaptations of classical works.
   Its current triumph is a monumental, two-part, five-hour
production of ``Peer Gynt,'' which played to sold-out crowds from
all over the country before closing a week ago. Michael Kuchwara,
drama critic for the Associated Press, called it ``a glorious
theatrical adventure, a journey that Lamos manages to make both
epic and intimate.''
   Last year, Lamos staged a modern-dress production of ``Hamlet''
set in a banana republic in turmoil.
   Lamos, whose six-play repertoire each season includes at least
half new plays, admits he prefers classics for their ability ``to
be inflamed again by living actors _ and with passion _ and speak
right to us.''
   ``The large plays from a century or two or longer ago have such
a tremendous scope I feel they exist for us now so that we can get
in touch with something that we lost, both spiritually and as a
society,'' he said. ``Whether it's a play by Aeschylus about the
murder of Agamemnon, or whether it's a Shakespearean comedy about
the possibility of forgiveness in an imperfect world, no matter
what it is, it's going to be something that widens you're ideas
about the world.
   ``It (theater) is a place for real spectacle, real wonder,
mystery, ambiguity _ all the reasons you go to church, all the
reasons the Greeks initially went to the theater _ to be sort of
blown away by the mystery of it.''
   But Lamos, looking youthful in blue jeans and high-top sneakers,
says those lofty thoughts have little to do with Hartford Stage's
rise to national prominence. Instead, he credits David Hawkanson,
his managerial counterpart in a business suit and glasses.
   Hawkanson was lured from the Arizona Theatre Company in Tucson.
He inherited an accumulated deficit of $440,000 and 7,900
subscribers _ down from 17,000 in 1977, when he arrived in
Connecticut in 1985. He hired marketing and public relations teams,
began a telemarketing campaign and went after the national press.
   Each year since Hawkanson's arrival, the company has posted
operating surpluses, reducing the overall deficit to $110,000.
Hawkanson expects it to be completely wiped out by next year.
   In 1989, the theater's 25th anniversary, subscriptions are back
up to 15,000, and attendance this year is expected to total
120,000, or about 95 percent of capacity.
   ``We worked very hard to get national criticism,'' Hawkanson
said. ``An actor will give up nine weeks to work here if they think
it will not get lost. Our ability to attract those people is
directly related to their perception about what is being done
here.''
   The decision of Emmy-award winning actor Richard Thomas (``The
Waltons'') to return for a second production in Hartford, is proof
of the strategy's success. Last year, he played the title role in
``Hamlet.'' This year, eager to tackle another difficult role and
to work again with Lamos, he returned for ``Peer Gynt,'' and he
looks forward to returning a third time.
   ``It's a great thing to find someone with whom one wants to work
and get satisfaction,'' Thomas said. ``An actor of my caliber
should be pleased to work at a theater like Hartford.
   ``They do interesting new plays and revivals of older ones.
Because it's in Hartford and one doesn't earn a lot of money,
people seem to think it's a sacrifice to work here. It isn't at
all.''
   The special Tony, based on recommendations by the American
Theater Critics Association, is presented by the League of American
Theater Producers and the American Theater Wing. Lamos and
Hawkanson will accept it during televised Tony ceremonies on June
4, making Hartford the second Connecticut theater to receive a Tony
for outstanding regional theater in the award's 14-year history.
Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven received the award in 1978.

<HEAD>One Twelfth of The Term Over, Bush Still Looks for His Team</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lacking an assistant secretary for
inter-American affairs, Secretary of State James A. Baker III had
to put in 40 hours negotiating with leaders of Congress on U.S. aid
to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Lacking presidential appointees to 33 key jobs in the Defense
Department, the Pentagon had to tell Congress it couldn't meet
deadlines for decisions on mobile missiles, a scaled-down Star
Wars, the cost of the new B-2 stealth bomber or the impact of a
prospective arms treaty.
   Lacking experts to run the huge Savannah River nuclear weapons
plant in South Carolina, Energy Secretary James Watkins fears that
the nation will run out of tritium, a key component for nuclear
warheads, and frets ``this is unilateral disarmament we're talking
about.''
   One twelfth of the way into George Bush's four-year term of
office, the government still lacks key players in key places.
   By the White House's count, Bush appointees are confirmed and on
the job in only 25 percent of the 447 key policy-making posts
requiring Senate confirmation.
   Charles G. Untermeyer, the White House personnel chief,
acknowledges, ``It is certainly taking longer than we would like.''
   But Untermeyer waves away the concerns expressed all over
Washington that Bush's slowness in fielding his own team is keeping
alive an image of a presidency that lacks mission, purpose and
vision.
   He offers an array of defenses and explanations:
   _It is a ``friendly takeover,'' so no harm is done if some
Reagan holdovers remain aboard for a few more months. ``We look
upon them as people who are carrying on the policy that George Bush
embraced,'' he says.
   _Better slow than sorry. Untermeyer says he'd rather explain now
why a job is still vacant than explain months for now that a bad
apple was shoved in ``because we were being pressured to name
someone.''
   _It takes longer to find qualified women and minorities. The
administration is pleased that so far 20 percent of presidential
appointments have gone to people in those categories. To date,
according to Ross Starek, deputy to Untermeyer, important jobs have
gone to 36 women, 13 blacks, seven Hispanics and three people of
Asian heritage.
   _Some of the still unfilled jobs have unusual technical
requirements, such as the assistant secretary of commerce who
serves as commissioiner of patents and trademarks. Untermeyer
wonders aloud why such posts are political appointments in the
first place.
   _Background checks by the FBI are vital, but slow down the
process. Untermeyer says they take take one to two months; the
bureau disagrees, saying it does the job in 22 days on average.
   _The first months of a new administration are spent in making
policy and the rest of the time in carrying it out. For
policymaking, the key players _ chiefly the Cabinet _ are in place.
   So, says Untermeyer: ``The lack of an assistant secretary here
or there has not kept George Bush from getting a budget compromise,
settling the FSX (the joint U.S.-Japan jet fighter), working out
the S&amp;L bailout or developing proposals on child care, education
and gun control. These are the hallmarks of an administration that
is up and running.''
   Others dispute that view as rosy. At an agency where only four
of 20 key positions have been filled, an official, who spoke on
condition he would not be identified, said: ``My sense is that the
secretary has got to be frustrated. He has half a dozen major
things on his plate and for the moment has only a few people to
deal with them.''
   Other facts complicate the situation.
   During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Sen. John
Warner, R-Va., had an aide read off some data Warner had assembled:
18 to 24 people had turned down the job of undersecretary of
defense for acquisition. Most cited the pay level or a new ethics
law with a stiff revolving door provision that keeps people who
leave government from taking a job in an industry they dealt with
while in government.
   But Untermeyer says Bush is moving as fast as predecessors.
   He says: ``George Bush has nominated 156 people vs. 184 at this
time for Ronald Reagan. He has announced his intention to nominate
another 45 and has retained 13 Reagan appointees for a total of
214. So he's practically at the same level as President Reagan was
eight years ago. The notion that we are `slow' is with no fixed
point of reference.''
   For all that, those in charge of running pieces of the
government are not so patient.
   In almost every executive agency, key decisions are postponed
because those who will make them _ or live with them _ are not in
place. Key jobs are occupied by Reagan holdovers who are unsure
whether they're going to be retained and unlikely to sign off on
any new initiatives.
   At the Energy Department, slowness in filling key posts ``is
delaying getting the admiral's agenda off the ground,'' said Joseph
W. Easton, executive assistant to Watkins, the retired naval
officer named by Bush to run the department. ``If you don't have
your team together, how can you play the game?''
   At the Pentagon, the long battle over the nomination of John G.
Tower to be defense secretary stalled action on issues requiring
political or policy judgments. Some people who were hired and
started working when it appeared Tower would be in charge have been
told they're out of work under Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney.
   The Federal Aviation Administration hasn't had an administrator
since Allan McArtor left on Feb. 17. Critical issues are piling up
_ the need to deal with aging airliners, international terrorism, a
crunch in airport capacity and a continuing shortage of air traffic
controllers. Bush has chosen an admiral, James B. Busey IV, to take
over the FAA, but that will require a law exempting him from a
requirement that the job go to a civilian.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Along Florida waterways starting to resemble an
aquatic Interstate 95, a new kind of traffic is worrying the Marine
Patrol _ water scooters, sometimes piloted by children hardly old
enough to ride a bicycle.
   The model names ring with excitement: Kawasaki makes Jet Skis,
Yamaha sells Wave Runners and Progressive Power Corp. offers the
Surf Jet, for example.
   But the boats that resemble snowmobiles are increasingly a
factor in some of Florida's worst accidents, and complaints about
operators are growing.
   ``The Florida Marine Patrol seems to come in contact with an
awful lot of people who are not safe and responsible, who are not
reasonable and prudent,'' said patrol Capt. Mike Lamphear. ``They
have lost touch with reality.''
   A 9-year-old boy died in March after his scooter, dead in the
water, was hit by another of the 7-foot-long craft in Biscayne Bay
off Miami. A 5-year-old boy survived after his head and chest were
slashed open by a boat that ran over his scooter in a lake north of
Miami, also in March.
   J.B. Spence, attorney for the family of the 9-year-old victim,
accuses operators of terrorizing swimmers and other boaters and has
a personal lawsuit pending against riders who frequent a canal by
his house in the Florida Keys.
   ``You see what they're like. They're like bucking broncos, they
ride the wake, they race,'' said Spence, who likens the machines'
sound to the roar of a chainsaw. ``They're just absolutely so rude
and arrogant that I sued them. I'm going to take them into court
and try to teach them some manners.''
   The two Miami accidents have focused attention on the first
statewide effort to regulate the low-riding vessels that are
propelled by a concentrated jet of water. Riders sit or kneel on
the machines, depending on the model.
   The six manufacturers of personal watercraft, which generally
cost $2,500 to $4,500, support the legislation by state Sen. Tom
McPherson, and view it as a national model to regulate the skis and
their free-wheeling operators.
   The measure was approved unanimously in late April by the
Florida Senate and was passed overwhelmingly by the House last
Friday.
   Quick to realize they could be at risk from government
regulators, the manufacturers _ the other three are Wet Jet
International, Bombardier and Ultranautics _ support McPherson's
bill. It sets an operator age limit of 14 for private vessels and
16 for rentals, banning reckless operation, restricting operation
to daylight hours, requiring operators to wear floatation vests and
a cut-off switch to stop the engine if the rider falls off.
Violation, a second-degree misdemeanor, would carry a $35 fine or
60 days in jail.
   Weaving through congested traffic, jumping wakes and ``playing
chicken'' would be outlawed, said Maj. Denis Grealish, boating
safety coordinator for the marine patrol. ``None of our
investigations have revealed any inherent safety problem or defects
with the craft.
   ``All of our problems have been caused by operator error. When
you look at these types of craft and the type of quick, fast
movement they're capable of and the centrifugal forces operating
against these people as they're making turns, you have to have a
certain amount of strength, coordination, balance and judgment to
operate these things.''
   The Personal Watercraft Industry Association, representing the
six manufacturers, also is monitoring other efforts to regulate the
craft, such as an assortment of New Hampshire bills that would ban
the vessels on small lakes where residents have registered noise
complaints.
   The organization estimates that 150,000 Americans own the
scooters.
   Most regulations are imposed locally for specific water bodies,
but the industry hopes to take the Florida bill to Texas next in
its bid to spread the measure nationally, said John Dane,
government relations representative in Washington for the National
Marine Manufacturers Association.
   ``We're hoping this bill serves as a national model,'' Dane said.
   The problem in Florida is compounded by burgeoning enthusiasm
for boating. Roughly 680,000 vessels, including 10,000 personal
watercraft, are registered to operate along Florida's 1,350 miles
of coastline and 11,000 miles of rivers, creeks and streams.
Grealish estimates another 200,000 to 300,000 boats operate in
Florida on a transient basis.
   The state leads the nation in boating fatalities with 106 in
1987 and 94 in 1988. Six involved personal watercraft last year. Of
the state's 11 fatalities with personal watercraft, only two
involved minors. Most victims are men ranging from their late teens
to mid 30s.
   McPherson has used the 1987 ban on manufacture of three-wheel
all-terrain vehicles, blamed for nearly 1,000 deaths and 300,000
injuries in five years, as a club in his bid to regulate personal
watercraft.
   Manufacturers ``first were kind of resistant to any
legislation,'' he said. But he noted in conversations with industry
representatives that ``three-wheelers went by the wayside because
they didn't have regulations, and the same thing could happen to
Jet Skis.''

<TEXT>
   In the arcane world of East-West arms
negotiations, a public relations touch can be a powerful tool.
President Bush will be trying to apply his own at the 40th
anniversary NATO summit, opening in Brussels on Monday.
   He has some catching up to do.
   Built into administration complaints about public relations
ploys in Soviet arms proposals is a tacit admission that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has been using that American technique to America's
disadvantage.
   Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, acknowledged
the importance of appearance when the administration offered an
upbeat appraisal of new Soviet proposals on conventional arms
limits. ``The president felt he appeared too negative before, so
he's trying to appear more positive now,'' Scowcroft said.
   This is the president's week to try to counter Gorbachev, to
cast himself and the United States as the real peacemakers. He's
conferring with allied leaders in Rome, Brussels, Bonn and London.
   But reclaiming the initiative will take more imaginative
gestures than his revived ``open skies'' arms verification proposal
or the ``open ledgers'' idea he offered on Wednesday.
   With Gorbachev piling theoretical troops, tanks and missiles
onto the negotiating table, Bush is left trying to explain a valid
concern: that even if those proposals come true, the Soviet side
will still have a hefty margin in weapons and troops. That is what
the administration says must be balanced by NATO's battlefield
nuclear weapons.
   The White House insists that Gorbachev is the one doing the
responding, that his arms reduction offers are in answers to
proposals first made by the West.
   The president's men are trying to cast Bush as the visionary
leader, the man whose themes and concepts will endure to reshape
the world balance long after the Soviet Union's itemized proposals
have been forgotten.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said western values and
principles are behind the changes occurring in the Communist world.
``We're winning economically, we're winning politically, we have
the other philosophy acknowledging that it is a failure,'' Baker
said. ``So, whatever we're doing is working ... and for the time
being I don't think we ought to ... say that we're going to change
that just for PR purposes.''
   But the Gorbachev proposals are scoring public opinion points in
western Europe, details and long-term merit notwithstanding. Even
as Bush called Gorbachev's latest offer ``forthcoming'' and said it
held promise for conventional force reductions, he said it does not
alter the need for Western deterrence, which means nuclear weapons
in Europe.
   ``These reductions alone, even if implemented, are not enough to
eliminate the significant numerical superiority that the Soviet
Union enjoys right now,'' the president said Wednesday.
   Nevertheless, Bush has a problem not unlike the one he created
for Michael Dukakis during the 1988 presidential campaign. In those
days, Bush was the one making catchy proposals and accusations,
leaving Dukakis to struggle through the fine print as he tried to
explain them away. Now, in a different kind of campaign, Gorbachev
has managed to do most of the sound-biting.
   After Gorbachev's offer to cut conventional arms, Bush came back
with an accountant's challenge: ``I call on the Soviets to do as we
have always done. Let's open the ledgers, publish an accurate
defense budget.''
   ``Open budgets openly arrived at'' is not a slogan likely to
stir the Western alliance.
   Ronald Reagan knew the public relations side of the arms control
balance, and played to it.
   A conservative candidate who had opposed arms limitation deals
before he came to office, Reagan boosted the defense budget and
took a hard line in early talks. And at the same time, he said that
he wasn't satisfied with strategic arms limitation efforts, that he
wanted a strategic arms reduction treaty. No more SALT talks. START
talks. Later, the zero option, applied by treaty to intermediate
range nuclear missiles. That precedent is a problem now, with the
West Germans pressing for immediate negotiations on short-range
nuclear weapons and the administration wary of pressure to
eliminate them, too.
   Now Gorbachev has the edge in Moscow-Washington public relations
contest. His proposals position the administration as the naysayer.
His offers come with such visual aids as flowers in Red Square on
May Day instead of glowering commissars reviewing missiles on
parade.
   Bush warns that such soothing signs must be read with prudence.
``The West is being tested by complacency,'' he said.
   Baker said the United States needs to be seen as creative and
forward-looking in dealing with Gorbachev and the changing Soviet
Union. But Baker said that doesn't mean ``going into an arms
control grab bag and competing with him on that score.''

<HEAD>Preston Pressed Into Speeding Avon's Turnaround</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Avon Products Inc. Chairman James E. Preston
says his 13-year-old stepdaughter has come home from school in
tears because of classmate taunts about cosmetics companies killing
animals in lab tests.
   He probably has felt similar emotions lately. Not only is Avon a
target of animal rights protests, the company also is under intense
pressure to improve its financial performance.
   The pressure has been building since Avon rejected a $2.1
billion takeover proposal from Amway Corp., a decision Preston may
live to regret if Avon fails to achieve what some securities
analysts are describing as highly optimistic sales and profit
projections.
   The beauty products giant, known in past years for the slogan
``Ding Dong, Avon Calling'' because of its white-gloved women
door-to-door sales squads, was putting the finishing touches on a
radical make over when Amway's offer landed on its own doorstep
earlier this month.
   In response to the unwanted overture, the management team led by
Preston huddled to plot a revised strategy aimed at justifying
their determination to preserve Avon's independence.
   Preston, during an interview in his office overlooking New
York's Central Park, summed up the goal this way: ``To run this
business differently than it's ever been run before.''
   Put like that, the task sounds simple. Judging by the critical
questions Preston fielded during a session to explain details of
the plan to financial analysts, however, Avon has a lot to prove.
   To be fair, Avon's harshest recent critics may be motivated more
by their own desire for quick profits than byan interest in
enhancing Avon's growth. Takeover stock speculators, for instance,
lost money after buying Avon shares on the hunch Amway's original
$39-a-share offer might incite a bidding war.
   But even those who respect Preston's management and experience
in the direct-selling business think he may have trouble keeping
his promises.
   ``It's really a very aggressive game plan in which all the
pieces of the puzzle have to fit exactly,'' says Andrew Shore,
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``There's no room for
error, everything has to go right. If he doesn't hit these numbers
clearly, there's going to be a credibility problem.''
   Shore, who had been recommending purchase of Avon shares based
on the theory that expectations for the company were overly
pessimistic, says he is reassessing his rating.
   Among the new numbers that have evoked scepticism are 1989
earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.30 to $2.40, on
a fully diluted basis. Avon management now is forecasting 1990
per-share earnings of at least $3.35 and at least $4 in 1991.
   The estimates far exceed management's expectations circulated
privately around the time of the company's annual shareholders
meeting on May 4.
   Avon normally doesn't reveal projections. It departed from usual
practice in an attempt to persuade shareholders that management
made the right decision in rebuffing Amway, a privately held
company based in Ada, Mich. that sells products ranging from
household cleaner to office supplies.
   Many observers say Avon has been on the right trackfor several
years and they applaud Preston's pursuit of a higher profile for
Avon's core beauty business. Avon has nearly completed the
divestiture of its disappointing health care services holdings and
Preston has admitted it was a mistake for Avon to have entered that
business in the first place.
   The transformation hasn't been altogether smooth. Despite 1988
sales of $3.06 billion, largely via 1.4 million independent sales
representatives in the United States and more than 80 other
countries, Avon lost $404.5 million in losses on discontinued
operations.
   Lauren L. Wong, analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc., credits
Prestonwith having the broad experience necessary for Avon to
maintain its ranking as the biggest U.S. direct-selling company and
a major supplier of beauty products.
   Preston, 56, began his Avon career in 1964 as a management
trainee. He's held positions in sales and marketing and
international field operations. As head of the beauty group
starting in 1981, he steered the division out of a slump and
visited sales representatives to learn their complaints.
   His elevation to president and chief operating officer in May
1988 came as a surprise because another Avon executive, John S.
Chamberlin, had been widely believed to be ahead of Preston for the
position.
   Preston was named chief executive officer in September 1988 and
became chairman of the board in January of this year after Hicks
Waldron retired.
   One of the biggest questions about Avon's revised strategy is
why the company has backed off its earlier, higher predictions for
overseas growth. Even after discounting the adverse impact of a
stronger dollar, the overseas estimates still are slightly below
previous expectations.
   Most analysts consider foreign markets to offer the best
opportunities for direct sellers.
   Wong of Oppenheimer says it had been anticipated that sales
outside the United States would outpace domestic sales, but Avon
apparently has scaled back expansion plans abroad. Wong says the
strategy could backfire by sacrificing future growth in favor of
short-term profits.
   Although Avon seems to have discouraged Amway for now, observers
don't think Avon automatically can count on unchallenged
independence, especially if financial results don't meet its
projections.
   Amway still owns a chunk of Avon stock and could make another
pitch some time to Avon's board. Takeover investor Irwin Jacobs
also owns some Avon shares. Mary Kay Corp., the Dallas-based
cosmetics seller, has expressed an interest in Avon and speculation
about other suitors has surfaced.
   Preston says numerous prospective buyers have approached him,
with particular interest in Avon's retail fragrance business,
consisting of some of the country's most popular perfumes sold in
department stores, such as Giorgio. So far, he says he's responded
the same way to everybody: ``The answer is _ not for sale.''
   While Preston's fending off takeover feelers, he also is trying
to deflect criticism from one animal welfare group, People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, that doubts Avon's commitment to
discontinuing the use of animals to screen the safety of its
products.
   The criticism is unfair, says Preston, because Avon has led the
trend toward adopting non-animal test methods and has donated money
to researching alternatives.
   Of the animal rights group that has been picking on Avon, even
protesting near Preston's Connecticut home, Preston says : ``I want
nothing to do with their confrontational style. They have set back
the animal rights movement.''

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Network crews are applauded by demonstrators in
Beijing, well aware of the power of U.S. television.
   The Chinese government, similarly aware of that power, shuts
down live satellite transmissions to the United States in the heat
of the demonstrations.
   Television brought the world the Civil Rights and anti-war
movements of the 1960s, the mass demonstrations in Iran in the
1970s, the people's uprising in the Philippines in the 1980s. As
the Yippies in Chicago chanted 21 years ago, ``The whole world is
watching!''
   This time we might be at a turning point. The Chinese government
pulled the plug on network transmissions, but that didn't stop it.
   ``You had this wonderful situation of American television
feeding back information (to the United States), and Chinese
Americans using everything from fax machines to telephones to feed
information back to China,'' said Robert Lichter of the
Washington-based Center for Media and Public Affairs, which
monitors the media. ``This really illustrates the truism that free
information is the enemy of authoritariansim, because it undercuts
the ability to control what people know.
   ``We are finally really attaining the `global village' that
Marshall McLuhan had predicted. ... Now it really is possible for
the whole world to be involved in social change anywhere in the
globe as it happens _ and the only thing that can do is speed up
the process.''
   ``The powerful hold press conferences. The powerless hold
demonstrations,'' said Berkeley sociology professor Todd Gitlin,
author of ``Inside Prime Time'' and ``The Sixties.'' ``The media
coverage isn't the only motive for the demonstrations, but it does
amplify what they do.''
   In the case of China, the government miscalculated the effect of
pulling the plug on American networks. That only increased the
coverage _ by 50 percent, according to Lichter.
   On the other hand, said Lichter, the coverage is ``less
important in China than was in the Philippines, because the
situation in China is less dependent on American public opinion.
Deng has less to fear from television than Marcos did,'' since
Marcos counted on American support for his government.
   Nevertheless, American living rooms have been filled the last
two weeks with wrenchingly sympathetic scenes of courageous Chinese
students defying the government and going on hunger strikes in
their quest for greater freedom. Dan Rather called them ``these
kids laying their lives on the line'' for democracy.
   CNN's Bernard Shaw recalled going through roadblocks in Beijing.
``People smiled and waved us on through. And people were applauding
us in Tiananmen Square. It's clear that people know who we are,
`we' meaning journalists _ being broadcast, television, radio or
print, photographers, still or videotape _ they know the importance
and the value of having us cover the story.''
   If the networks portray the Chinese students as the scrappy,
freedom-loving underdogs and the Chinese government hard-liners as
bad guys, they put themselves in the role of the cavalry.
   It seemed the biggest event on American TV last week was the
Chinese government's act of unplugging network satellite
transmissions. The networks seemed to revel in the unusual
confrontation with blatant repression, especially CBS and CNN,
which had the PR advantage of having their most visible anchormen
on the scene, Shaw and Rather.
   ABC and NBC covered CNN being shut down. CNN carried lengthy
coverage of its own negotiations to stay on the air, as did CBS _
14 minutes' worth during the season finale of ``Dallas.''
   ``We actually saw what happens when institutional authorities
confront the media,'' said Gitlin. ``We saw it unfolding in real
time. We saw these functionaries arrive from some Chinese bureau,
we found them telling the CNN people to fold it up, we saw the CNN
guy on the phone to his boss in Atlanta, we saw that whole
exchange. I think we very rarely to see what happens when
institutions are at work. If the media did the same thing in the
case of lots of other events, then I think they would be doing a
great deal to educate a democratic republic.''
   ``The rap on TV is that TV becomes the story,'' said Lichter.
``But this is a story that's even bigger than Dan Rather. I mean,
this is a story so big that the presence of TV, I think, doesn't
really change it that much. It just means we're better informed
than we would be if TV wasn't there.''
   Gitlin recalls that the networks toned down their coverage of
anti-war protests after the Democratic Convention in Chicago in
1968 out of fear they were ``amplifying the sense of dissension.
... Clearly when it comes to China, they're not concerned that they
might be amplifying division. It's very clear to them who are the
good guys and who are the bad guys.''
   ``Part of the difficulty is it's hard to find people who are
defending the Li Peng (hard-line) faction of the government,'' said
Brokaw. ``He's not available, his spokesmen are not available, the
embassy here has clammed up. And there are any number of people who
are willing to be critical of repression and martial law. So in
that regard, I suppose you could make the case that the coverage
does appear to be sympathetic _ but that's because the events are
sympathetic.''

   The U.S. economy grew at a moderate 4.3
percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, the
government said in a report economists and the Bush administration
saw as a sign the country's record peacetime expansion is
continuing.
   The Commerce Department's revision in the first-quarter gross
national product to well below its original 5.5 percent estimate
came amid worries that Federal Reserve efforts to stem inflation
could move the economy into a recession.
   But Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said Thursday the report
shows that ``Fed policy over the past year appears to be succeeding
in steering the economy to a more moderate, but sustainable, growth
path.''

   Top business economists predict the U.S.
economy is headed for a ``soft landing'' in which growth slows
enough to tame inflation and interest rates without toppling the
country into a recession this year.
   The latest survey from the National Association of Business
Economists, released Thursday, projects that the gross national
product, the broadest measure of the economy's health, will grow
2.8 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 1990.
   That would represent a significant retreat from the robust 3.9
percent pace of growth last year.

   The commission voted 5-0 Thursday to phase out current rules
that restrict the trading of particular options to only one

<HEAD>Trump Promises `Best of Everything' on New Shuttle Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Real estate tycoon Donald Trump plans to spend
millions of dollars to give his new Trump Shuttle ``the best of
everything'' and may attempt to buy more assets of strike-torn
Eastern Airlines.
   ``You're going to see the friendliest airline, you're going to
see the best managed airline there is,'' Trump said Thursday. ``I
think the service is going to be fantastic.''
   The $365 million deal for the New York-Washington-Boston shuttle
should close in about two weeks and the airline should be operating
as the new Trump Shuttle soon after, he said.
   ``We intend to have the best of everything,'' Trump told a news
conference at his opulent Plaza Hotel in midtown Manhattan.
   Trump also indicated a possible interest in buying other Eastern
assets, such as more planes, saying, ``We're looking at different
elements of Eastern.''
   Trump Shuttle President Bruce Nobles said Trump hopes to capture
75 percent of the shuttle market that is split with Pan Am Corp.
after one year of operation, but he called the target ``a little
ambitious.''
   The shuttle is used mainly by business travelers and was
Eastern's only consistently profitable operation before the March 4
strike by its Machinists, which was joined by its pilots and flight
attendants unions.
   The Eastern shuttle lost many passengers to Pan Am's rival
shuttle because of the walkout and now has less than a 25 percent
market share.
   Trump has pledged to upgrade the shuttle, whose fleet of 21
aging, blue-and-silver Boeing 727s will be refurbished and painted
with red, black and gold stripes and Trump's name on the tail.
   ``We're going to be spending millions of dollars on each
plane,'' Trump said. He also repeated a pledge to exceed federal
regulations in checking each jet for safety.
   ``I'm elated about it. I've been unemployed for three months;
it's a relief,'' said Bill Sanford, a striking Eastern pilot from
Marietta, Ga., who is one of 170 pilots tentatively hired by Trump
Shuttle.
   Trump, who owns several casino-hotels in Atlantic City, N.J.,
also operates a helicopter service between New York and that resort
city. He said he is interested in possibly routing the shuttle to
Atlantic City on weekends.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland on Thursday formally
approved the sale to Trump, which followed withdrawal of a rival
$415 million buyout proposal from America West Airlines, which
could not arrange financing.
   Miami-based Eastern first agreed to sell Trump the shuttle last
October, but the deal was delayed by court challenges from
Eastern's unions and the need for bankruptcy court approval.
   Eastern officials have said the strapped airline would net
around $300 million from the shuttle sale after paying lease
obligations and other related expenses.
   Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors March
9.
   Eastern's unions wanted the airline sold as a single entity. But
in addition to the shuttle sale, Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.
has decided to sell about $1.4 billion in other assets separately
as part of a plan to build a smaller carrier.
   Union representatives are holding discussions with two investor
groups that have submitted formal bids for all of Eastern. One
group is headed by former Piedmont Airlines Chairman William Howard
and the other by Chicago commodities trader Joseph Ritchie.

<HEAD>Bethlehem Steel Chairman Defends Wage Increases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. says a doubling of
productivity since steelworkers had their last wage increase in
1982 helps take the sting out of its newly ratified labor contract.
   While the United Steelworkers union was counting ballots
Thursday, Bethlehem's competitors were criticizing the contract's
terms in Washington at the annual conference of the American Iron
and Steel Institute.
   By a margin of nearly 4-1, 11,386-3,009, union members ratified
a 50-month package that raises average base wages by $2.50 per hour
to $13.72 by July 1993.
   ``It was certainly rich enough,'' LTV Steel Co. President David
Hoag said Thursday. ``It covered a lot of things.''
   Bethlehem Steel Chairman Walter F. Williams said the added costs
of the contract can be offset by a modest increase of $18 per ton
in steel prices over the next four years. Bethlehem's prices now
average slightly more than $500 per ton, he said.
   ``I frankly don't understand how anyone could expect us not to
have some increase in our labor costs after being flat for six
years,'' Williams said.
   National Steel Corp. also is nearing a contract agreement with
the USW. An announcement could come as early as today on terms
influenced by the Bethlehem settlement, according to sources who
spoke on condition they not be identified.
   Contracts at National, Inland Steel Corp. and Armco Inc. expire
July 31, the same deadline Bethlehem faced.
   The 20,500 USW members at the nation's second-largest steelmaker
won an immediate base wage increase of $1 per hour, or 8 percent,
to $12.22 an hour as a restoration of past sacrifices. The base
wage will rise by $1 on Jan. 1, 1991, and by 50 cents on Jan. 1,
1992.
   They get an immediate $500 signing bonus and a $500 advance on
profit-sharing payments. Pension and medical benefits will be
sweetened, and three paid holidays and Sunday premium pay will be
restored over the contract life.
   Increased payments early in the contract are mostly obligations
from earlier sacrifices, and the workers will not see new money
until 1991, Williams said.
   USX Corp. Executive Vice President J. Bruce Johnston, formerly
chief labor negotiator for the entire steel industry, called the
Bethlehem agreement unfortunate. One steel executive, speaking
privately, called the terms tragic.
   The hourly increases amount to 4.6 percent per year, and prices
would have to increase only 3.8 percent per year to offset the new
costs, one analyst said.
   Depending on inflation and profit-sharing, the new contract
could raise the company's average labor costs from around $26.50
per hour now to $31.60 per hour when it expires in July 31, 1993,
according to studies,
   Industry-wide labor costs averaged $24.56 per hour in 1988,
according to the AISI.
   Williams said the pact also provides for plant-level
negotiations to streamline work rules and further improve
productivity.
   Productivity has roughly doubled since 1982, lessening the
impact of labor costs on total production costs, he said. The
company can produce a ton of steel with the equivalent of one man
working four hours. That's down from around 8 man-hours per ton six
years ago.

<HEAD>No TV Ads in California Classrooms, Schools Chief Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   California's chief educator says he will
withhold state funds from schools that show an experimental
television news program for teen-agers that includes a daily dose
of commercials.
   The creators of Channel One want to offer the 12-minute-a-day
show to schools nationwide, providing satellite dishes, television
sets and video recorders in exchange for a guarantee students will
watch the program daily.
   But Bill Honig, California's superintendent of public education,
said Thursday he would withhold some state money from public
schools that agree to accept the show billed by its makers as an
innovative educational tool.
   Mandatory viewing of ads runs counter to state law defining
schools' educational mission, he said.
   Honig cannot order local school districts to ban the show. But
his control of state funds for education gives him considerable
influence.
   Honig said Channel One, a for-profit venture by Whittle
Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., would in effect put teachers
and school administrators in the position of endorsing commercial
products.
   ``The whole reason for this is to have access to kids' minds,
our youngsters' minds,'' Honig said. ``We would be ceding control
of our curriculum to a commercial enterprise.''
   Whittle, which tested the teen-oriented news show in six schools
across the country this spring, said company lawyers have checked
California law and disagree with Honig's interpretation.
   ``To come out and reject something that's not even in existence
seems to us to be a little bit premature,'' Whittle spokesman David
Jarrard said.
   Teachers who took part in the test screenings have given the
show rave reviews. But several mainstream educational
organizations, including the national Parent-Teacher Association
and the National Association of Secondary School Principals, oppose
widespread adoption of Channel One.
   The show's youthful newscasters present the events of the day,
with an emphasis on how they affect teens. It runs 10 minutes plus
two minutes of ads for blue jeans, candy, hamburgers and other
products.
   In exchange for a guarantee students will watch the show daily,
each school gets a satellite TV dish to receive Channel One and
other programs, a video recorder and a color television set for
each participating classroom. The package is valued at $50,000 per
school.
   Honig would block Channel One from the state's 4.5 million
students by using his authority over state grants that are made to
individual schools on the basis of attendance.
   If every high-school student in the state watched Channel One,
grants for the time spent would amount to $29.8 million, Honig said.

<HEAD>Riegle: Unfair Trading List Ensures Autos Will Be Discussed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will address barriers
to exports of U.S. autos, even though cars aren't expressly on an
official list of products subject to unfair trade restrictions,
Sen. Donald Riegle says.
   The long-awaited list, announced Thursday, targets trade
barriers in Japan, Brazil and India to fulfill a new U.S. trade law
in a move that could mean huge tariffs against some foreign
products.
   Riegle, D-Mich., played a key role in placing the new provision,
known as Super 301, in the trade bill passed last year. The law
requires the administration to identify the most harmful trade
barriers and gives the administration 18 months to negotiate the
removal of the barriers.
   The list of harmful trade practices in Japan named satellites,
supercomputers and forest products as areas that had suffered from
Japanese trading practices. It omitted the automotive sector, which
accounts for almost two-thirds of the $55 billion U.S. trade
imbalance with Japan.
   But Riegle aides said the inclusion of distribution systems on
the agenda ensured automotive issues would be addressed in
negotiations with Tokyo on trade barriers built into the Japanese
regulatory and marketing system. Closed distribution is one of the
greatest barriers the industry faces to entry into the Japanese
market.
   ``The Super 301 process is having the effect I intended when it
was written,'' Riegle said. ``While other countries could and
should be listed, this initial list is a key step forward.''
   Chrysler Corp., the nation's third largest automaker, said in a
statement it was encouraged that distribution systems in Japan were
included on the trade-imbalance list.
   ``Chrysler will, over the next 12 months, aggressively attempt
to fulfill its commitment to break into the Japanese market as we
have in Europe and Taiwan,'' the company said.
   ``If we are not successful in cracking this market, we will
still have the option to refile for Super 301 designation of auto
distribution as a priority practice,'' Chrysler said.
   If administration talks fail to produce results in 18 months,
the government can levy tariffs of up to 100 percent against
selected imports from an offending country.
   Automobiles and auto parts are not on the formal list and so
would not come under the 18-month rule.
   The list had its critics, including Nobuo Matsunaga, the
Japanese ambassador to the United States.
   ``In light of the good-faith efforts that have been made, the
government of Japan and the Japanese people are greatly
disappointed by this one-sided decision,'' Matsunaga said in a news
release. ``There may well be some domestic backlash in Japan which
will make the resolution of the various problems even more
difficult.''

<HEAD>Work Needed to Continue Recovery, Chairman Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp., still rebuilding after
three years of losses, seeks to grow into the dominant bank on the
West Coast and to focus international efforts in the Pacific Basin,
its chairman said.
   A.W. Clausen, chairman and president of the holding company that
owns the nation's third-largest bank, told stockholders at the
annual meeting Thursday the company must capitalize on 10 quarterly
gains by Bank of America.
   ``It is a record of which we are proud,'' Clausen said of the
recovery, ``but one which we realize represents not the end, but
just the beginning, of our efforts.''
   Last month, the company reported a first-quarter profit of $275
million, or $1.38 a share, up from $109 million, or 56 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   The financial institution returned to the black last year,
posting a year-end profit after a string of losses that began in
1985. The problems stemmed from losses on Third World loans and on
real estate and farm lending in this country.
   Laying out goals, Clausen said: ``We are going to grow
carefully, but with absolute certainty, throughout the Pacific
Coast and be the dominant provider of financial services in the
western United States.''
   International growth will focus on opportunities for finance and
trade in the Pacific Basin, he said.

<HEAD>Universal Claiming Victory; Others Not So Sure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Universal Foods Corp. officials are claiming
victory in their six-month battle against a hostile takeover by
High Voltage Engineering Corp.
   But others see possible further moves by High Voltage despite
this week's federal appeals court ruling in favor of the
Milwaukee-based Universal Foods.
   ``I think they have to raise their price,'' Milwaukee investment
analyst Martin McDevitt said. ``The court, in effect, has said it
doesn't think much of the Universal defense.
   ``If they (High Voltage) raise the price to, say, $40 or $41,
that has got to get the attention of the Universal board. I don't
think the board can stonewall that,'' McDevitt said.
   High Voltage has offered to buy Universal stock at $38 a share,
a deal valued at about $750 million. Universal stock dropped $1.75
a share on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday to $35.
   The ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago
affirmed a March 18 decision by U.S. District Judge Joseph P.
Stadtmueller of Milwaukee upholding the constitutionality of
Wisconsin's anti-takeover law. It left unchanged the lower court's
decision upholding Universal's shareholder rights plan.
   Terrence M. O'Reilly, vice president and general counsel for
Universal, said Thursday that the offer by Amanda Acquisition
Corp., a High Voltage subsidiary formed for the acquisition of
Universal, could not proceed after the court decision.
   ``Amanda's offer for Universal cannot proceed in light of its
defeat in the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals'' in Chicago, O'Reilly
said. ``Amanda's counsel told the Court of Appeals that if the
Wisconsin Business Combination Statute were upheld, its takeover
offer would be `doomed.' The court relied on the statement in
disposing of the case.
   ``Unless Amanda was misleading the Court of Appeals, its offer
is over.''
   But High Voltage officials said only that they were reviewing
their options.
   An unidentified High Voltage legal adviser quoted by the
Milwaukee Sentinel mentioned the possibility of filing a motion
asking that the appeals court rule on the legality of the
anti-takeover defense used by Universal.
   High Voltage, based in Burlington, Mass., and headed by New York
City investors, has extended the tender offer several times since
it was first made last December. The offer, scheduled to expire
June 6, is conditional on getting judicial issues resolved.
   ``The court found that although the statute may well be economic
folly, it is constitutional,'' said Clifford Press, High Voltage
deputy chairman.
   ``While not deciding the poison-pill case, the opinion does cast
serious doubt on Universal's `just-say-no' defense. In light of the
court decision, we are reviewing our options,'' he said.
   Guy A. Osborn, Universal president and chief executive officer,
said company leaders feel ``shareholders will profit most if
Universal remains independent to pursue its highly successful
business plan which delivered a 30 percent increase in earnings per
share last year, will do so again this year, and indicated a 20
percent increase against next year.''
   In a 21-page decision, Appeals Judge Frank H. Easterbrook said
``Wisconsin's law may well be folly; we are confident that it is
constitutional.''
   Universal Foods manufactures and markets food ingredients and
selected consumer food items.

   Share prices were modestly higher at midday Friday

   However, dealers said the approaching start to the three-day

   An investor group including Mary Kay Cosmetics
Inc. says it wants to acquire rival Avon Products Inc., which last
week rejected a $2.1 billion takeover bid from Amway Corp.
   John P. Rochon, vice chairman of Mary Kay Corp., parent of the
cosmetics company, late Thursday made public a letter to Avon
saying the investor group has had talks with Avon about a possible
takeover.
   No figures were mentioned in the letter, which was sent to Avon
Chairman James E. Preston.
   Avon spokesman John Cox said the company would have no comment
on Mary Kay's interest at least until after the matter was
discussed at a regularly scheduled board meeting on June 1. In
response to Amway's offer, Preston stated that Avon wasn't for sale.
   The letter said Mary Kay and Avon each would maintain separate
sales forces and identities if an acquisition were successful.
   On Wednesday, stock speculators bid Avon shares higher following
a report that the cosmetics company may be the target of a hostile
takeover attempt.
   ``We have never before publicly disclosed either our interest in
Avon or the fact or content of any of the discussions we or our
financial advisors, the First Boston Corp., have had with Avon or
its advisors,'' the letter said.
   ``However, because recent press accounts involving Avon referred
to Mary Kay Cosmetics, the company now feels it necessary to advise
the people who are key to its success _ its sales force _ of the
nature of its interest in Avon,'' Rochon said.
   If a bid were successful, Avon would be directed by Argonaut
Partners, an investment arm of Mary Kay Cosmetics, Rochon said. He
said Mary Kay sales directors were notified about the interest in
Avon on Thursday.
   On Wednesday, following a USA Today report that investor Irwin
L. Jacobs and an unidentified ``major company'' planned to launch a
joint bid for Avon at $40 a share, Avon stock soared on the New
York Stock Exchange in heavy trading.
   Avon dropped 75 cents to $35.12{ in composite NYSE trading
Thursday after gaining $1.37{ the previous day.
   USA Today had reported that Jacobs and the unidentified company
were in the process of completing financing and other details of
the hostile offer. Jacobs' partner was said to be a company other
than Mary Kay.
   Amway last week was rebuffed by Avon in a $39-a-share takeover
offer that valued Avon at $2.1 billion.
   Jacobs owns 10.3 percent of Avon's common stock through a
partnership with Amway. Amway, an Ada, Mich.-based direct selling
firm, withdrew its offer after Avon's rejection.

   Japan angrily refused today to negotiate to avoid
trade sanctions under terms set by the United States, and Tokyo
said it may haul Washington into international trade court.
   The United States on Thursday named Japan, Brazil and India as
unfair traders that must negotiate to remove barriers within 18
months or face possible sanctions, including tariffs of up to 100
percent on selected goods.
   India joined Japan in criticizing the U.S. action. Commerce
Minister Dinesh Singh said it was ``totally unjustified, irrational
and unfair.''
   The Japanese Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador Michael
Armacost today to explain the government's position, said ministry
spokesman Taizo Watanabe.
   ``The government of Japan has no intention of entering into
negotiations with the United States under the conditions imposed
under Super 301,'' Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, minister of international
trade and industry, said in a statement.
   ``Super 301'' refers to the provision of the 1988 U.S. Omnibus
Trade Act allowing the United States to target countries and
practices that block American exports.
   The European Community and Japan and other countries have said
the unilateral nature of the U.S. law may violate the provisions of
the international General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
   If sanctions are imposed under Super 301, Japan may bring a
complaint before GATT, which is supposed to help resolve trade
disputes, Watanabe said.
   Watanabe was not as confrontational as Mitsuzuka, however.
Although Japan will not negotiate under terms of the U.S. law, it
may propose ``quiet talks and joint cooperation'' that may
``coincide with'' the negotiations Washington demands, Watanabe
said.
   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno called the U.S. action ``extremely
regrettable,'' and said it was designed to draw attention away from
a large source of the trade imbalance, the U.S. budget deficit.
   ``As a result of many market-opening measures that have been
taken to date, the Japanese market has now become a widely open
market,'' Uno told reporters.
   ``The U.S. itself maintains import restrictive measures and
practices to a considerable degree,'' he said.
   Japan was targeted for unfair trade practices in supercomputers,
satellites and lumber.
   But officials cited increases in Japanese purchases of U.S.
goods and expressed anger at U.S. charges of unfairness.
   Japan is launching five U.S. communications and broadcasting
satellites this year, ``which proves our satellite market is open
to foreign companies,'' said Posts and Telecommunications Minister
Seiichi Kataoka.
   The United States charges that Japan's policy of encouraging a
domestic space industry prohibits the purchase of foreign
satellites if they interfere with ``indigenous development
objectives,'' effectively limiting U.S. access to the market.
   Japan will buy eight U.S. supercomputers within three years, the
government announced earlier this month.
   The United States says that through a variety of exclusionary
practices, Japan has ``thwarted the open procurement process'' of
supercomputers.
   The U.S. statement also said Brazil's import licensing system
``inhibits market access and creates uncertainty for U.S.
exporters.'' It criticized India for requiring government approval
of all new or expanded foreign investment.
   Dinesh, India's commerce ministerm said Washington had no right
to blame his country for blocking U.S. imports when the United
States does the same thing with Indian imports.
   ``The United States' action is particularly surprising because
the U.S. itself has built and retained a variety of barriers
against access to its markets. It is hardly in a position to ask
others to lift barriers without doing so itself,'' Dinesh said in a
statement.
   The United States has a trade deficit of about $700 million with
India and a $52 billion deficit with Japan.
   Last year, India exported $3.2 billion in goods to the United
States and U.S. exports to Indian was about $2.5 billion.

   President Bush, urging Japan, Brazil and India
to open their markets to U.S. products, said today that
negotiations aimed at ending unfair trade practices will begin with
the three countries on June 16.
   The Japanese trade minister declared, however, that his
government would refuse to take part in such talks under duress.
   The administration singled out the three nations Thursday night
for priority action under a 1988 trade law that calls for penalties
against countries that are deemed to be especially protectionist.
   ``Our goal is to open markets and to eliminate trade barriers.
We oppose protectionism in any and all forms. Therefore, I urge the
governments of Japan, India, and Brazil to work constructively with
us to resolve these issues expeditiously,'' the president said in a
statement announcing the negotiation date as he left on a trip to
Europe.
   The 1988 Omnibus Trade Act requires the administration to issue
what amounts to a hit list that names the countries whose trade
barriers are most harmful to American producers. The government
then has 18 months to negotiate away the barriers.
   Failure of the talks could lead to tariffs of up to 100 percent
on selected exports from the offending countries.
   Announcing the action, U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills
told reporters, ``This exercise is not intended to be offensive. I
hope there is no backlash.''
   However, Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga issued a statement
calling the decision to include his country ``extremely
regrettable.''
   In Tokyo, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, minister of international trade and
industry, said in a statement: ``The government of Japan has no
intention of entering into negotiations with the United States
under the conditions imposed (in the law).''
   Taizo Watanabe, spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, was
less emphatic, saying that while Japan will not negotiate under
terms of the law, it may propose ``quiet talks and joint
cooperation'' that may ``coincide with'' the negotiations
Washington wants.
   India joined Japan in criticizing the U.S. action. Commerce
Minister Dinesh Singh said it was ``totally unjustified, irrational
and unfair.''
   Hills also announced the United States would be watching closely
25 countries suspected of failing to protect U.S. copyrights and
patents and said the Bush administration would reveal the status of
the eight most flagrant ones in November.
   The Japanese lobbied in recent weeks to stay off the list of top
trade violators. They were less successful, however, than the
Koreans, who made a number of trade concessions in recent days and
did manage to avoid inclusion.
   ``In light of the good faith efforts that have been made, the
government of Japan and the Japanese people are greatly
disappointed by this one-sided decision,'' Matsunaga said. ``There
may well be some domestic backlash in Japan which will make the
resolution of the various problemseven more difficult.''
   Japan was cited for its refusal to buy U.S. supercomputers and
satellites as well as its barriers to purchase of U.S. wood
products. The United States ran a trade deficit of $52 billion last
year with Japan, or 44 percent of the $119.8 billion U.S. trade
imbalance.
   India was cited for barriers that bar foreign investment and the
closing of its insurance market to foreign companies.
   The administration cited Brazil for quotas on imports and
licensing restrictions.
   Hills said the administration plans ``to immediately commence
negotiations on all of this that we have identified'' but added
that there was no certainty that they could succeed.
   ``I have no assurance,'' she said. ``I have only my own good
will and I hope we can approach these negotiations with a
constructive dialogue.''
   Besides citing Japan, Brazil and India for flagrant trade
barriers, the administration placed eight countries on a ``priority
watch list'' of nations that have failed to protect U.S. copyrights
and patents. It declined, however, to target any countries for
priority action on that issue.
   It did establish a lesser ``watch list'' of 17 other countries
that have not established safeguards against infringement on U.S.
copyrights and patents.
   The president also has directed Cabinet officials to open
separate negotiations with the Japanese on eliminating ``structural
impediments'' to sales of U.S. goods within their economy. The
impediments range from pricing mechanisms to bid rigging.
   In his statement today, Bush said U.S. officials looked at ``a
large number of practices'' that ultimately were not listed _
including Japanese rice quotas and the subsidies given by the
European Community to the manufacturers of Airbus airliners. He
said it was felt they could be better addressed through existing
international trade forums.
   On Capitol Hill, Senate sponsors of the trade law reacted
favorably to the administration's action.
   ``I expect we'll hear howls of outrage from both sides on this,
claims the action was either rash or timid,'' Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said in a statement.
   Bentsen called the move ``only a first step but an important one
in establishing an effective trade policy. ... We've let the world
know where our priorities lie when it comes to opening markets.''
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., called the action ``a very
positive first step,'' and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said ``I think
the administration deserves a passing grade. They are stepping up
to the problem.''
   Elsewhere in Congress, however, voices of dissent suggested that
the administration had not gone far enough.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said he was ``disappointed'' that
Hills ``left off so many other unfair Japanese trade practices from
the list, including auto parts and construction services.''
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., said the decision ``is more a
compromise among factions within the administration than a clear
message to our trading partners and a clear policy for America.''
   The president's chief economic adviser, Michael Boskin, and
budget director Richard Darman had argued strenuously that
targeting Japan would do more harm than good, while Hills and
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called for a tough crackdown.
   Danforth told reporters, however, he saw nothing unusual about
disagreement within an administration before such a decision.
   Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich., said the targeting of Japan showed
that the trade law ``is beginning to produce important results.''
   Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
called the plan ``a positive first step toward dismantling foreign
trade barriers.''
   Countries named to the priority watch list for patents and
copyrights were Brazil, India, Korea, Mexico, China, Saudi Arabia,
Taiwan and Thailand.
   Additional countries named to what the administration described
as a less urgent watch list were Argentina, Canada, Chile,
Columbia, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia,
Pakistan, the Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Venezuela and
Yugoslavia.

<HEAD>Ford Stops Production at Two Escort Plants, First Time in 6 Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Wayne plant scheduled shutdown.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. said today it will halt
production temporarily at two plants to shrink inventories of its
Escort subcompact car, last year's most popular automobile.
   Ford spokesman Ray Windecker said production at the company's
Edison, N.J., plant stopped Monday and is to resume June 5. On that
date, the company's plant in Wayne, Mich., will stop production for
a week.
   The two plants are the only ones making the Escort. Ford has
about a 100-day supply of Escorts at the current selling rate,
Windecker said.
   The shutdowns are the first in six years in which Ford has
closed any plant to reduce inventory. Plants typically shut down in
late summer to retool for the next model year.
   In 1988, Ford sold 387,815 Escorts, making it the most popular
vehicle behind Ford and Chevrolet pickup trucks. Through May 20 of
this year, Escorts were selling at a pace 5.1 percent behind last
year's.
   Ford has about 1,500 workers at the Edison plant and about 3,000
at the Wayne plant.
   ``The subcompact market is running below expectations,''
Windecker said.
   Ford officials said in April that an average of 10 percent to 15
percent of the cars it sells are built on overtime. In the past,
Ford has reduced inventories of specific models by slowing the
assembly line or trimming overtime. That strategy failed with the
Escort.

   Prices and interest rates were mixed, showing generally small
changes, in the credit markets today.
   But stocks seemed to benefiting from speculation that the recent
downturn in rates might go further soon, with encouragement from
the Federal Reserve.
   The economy has showed signs of slowing lately, as Fed
policymakers have intended.
   Furthermore, some observers think the central bank might want to
ease credit in order to slow the recent sharp rise of the dollar in
foreign exchange.
   Sea Containers Ltd. jumped 8| to 56|. The European companies
Tiphook PLC and Stena AB made a $50-a-share offer for Sea
Containers, and traders quickly bid up the price in anticipation of
a possible higher offer.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.73 to 178.78. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.25 at 353.90.

<HEAD>Chase Manhattan Purchases Credit Card Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chase Manhattan Bank will purchase the credit
card portfolio of Michigan National Corp. for more than $220
million, cementing Chase's position as the nation's No. 2 bank
credit card issuer, it was announced Friday.
   The portfolio, held by the Independence One Bank N.A. subsidiary
of Michigan National, consists of more than one million Visas and
MasterCards with outstanding balances totaling about $1.1 billion.
   Chase called the acquisition the largest in the history of the
credit card industry.
   According to a statement from Michigan National, Chase will pay
between $224 million and $228 million based on a formula applied as
of May 31. A Chase spokesman had no comment on the price.
   The addition of the portfolio will increase Chase's cardholder
base to 7 million accounts with total outstandings in excess of $8
billion.
   Independence One is the 12th-largest Visa card issuer in the
United States, Michigan National said in a release.
   While Independence One contributed positively to its parent
company's earnings, Michigan National Chairman Robert Mylod noted
that the credit card business ``is becoming concentrated with many
of the largest banks in the country seeking to be dominant ... The
dramatic portfolio growth of larger issuers has given them very
substantial competitive advantages.''
   The move represents Chase's second credit-card acquisition this
year. Chase purchased Philadelphia-based Meritor Financial Group's
credit card portfolio in January.
   Chase is making the purchase through its Delaware affiliate,
Chase Manhattan Bank (USA). Michigan National is based in
Farmington Hills, Mich.; Independence One is based in Rapid City,
S.D.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many investors may be celebrating the stock
market's recent comeback, but there's little to shout about for
people who bet on the securities industry itself.
   Share prices of most publicly held investment firms,
particularly those that do a large amount of their business with
the public, linger far below their peaks earlier in the 1980s.
   For example, Merrill Lynch, around $30 last week, is trading for
barely half its 1983 high of $56.50.
   Salomon Inc., a pre-eminent investment banker, stood recently
around $26, vs. a high just three years ago of $59.50.
   The stock of Charles Schwab Corp., the largest of the discount
brokers, has rallied from a post-crash $5.75 to $11.75 as of late
last week. That's still quite a way short, however, of the $16.50
price it commanded when it was first offered to the public in
September of 1987.
   There's no mystery about all this to regular readers of the
financial pages. While stock prices have risen sharply in the past
six months, most sources of brokers' income remain depressed.
   Individual investors are still wary or just plain turned off.
Competition for business from investing institutions has shaved
commissions on their trades razor-thin.
   ``Continued sluggishness in capital and consumer market
activity, combined with a barrage of negative articles in the press
concerning the near-term outlook for the brokerage business, has
kept pressure on the brokerage stocks,'' said Lawrence Eckenfelder,
an analyst who follows the industry for Prudential-Bache Securities.
   For firms such as Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber, Eckenfelder
observed in his current monthly report on the group, ``the story is
still the same.
   ``In order for earnings to move upward in a meaningful way from
current levels, the retail business must gain momentum.''
   The Value Line Investment Survey, which has just published its
quarterly appraisal of the securities industry, ranks it 83rd out
of 92 groups it follows for likely stock-price performance over the
next 12 months.
   ``Ever since the stock market collapsed in October 1987, trading
volume has been severely depressed,'' the investment advisory
service observed.
   ``But, at least among the big Wall Street firms, mergers and
acquisitions (and the hefty fees they bring in) have been picking
up the slack.
   ``Now some wariness has set in: Will Congress limit the size of
buyouts? Will rising interest rates make haevy debt burdens too
risky?
   ``Although there aren't yet any definitive answers to these
questions, merger and acquisition activity has been on the back
burner since the start of the year. In the first quarter, for
example, the number of transactions dropped 30 percent from the
year-ago quarter, and dollar volume fell 58 percent.
   ``Many companies report there are enough deals in the pipeline
so that second quarter results should show an increase, but at this
point we're not expecting 1989 to catch up to 1988.''
   A telling gauge of the state of Wall Street is the price of a
seat, or membership, at the New York Stock Exchange. On May 9, a
seat changed hands for $500,000, less than half the pre-crash
record of $1.15 million.
   ``Seat prices have a volatile history, in line with the
boom-bust cycles that regularly recur in the securities business,''
noted John Connolly at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in a recent
commentary.
   ``In 1977 times were so bad that an NYSE seat sold for $35,000,
or slightly less than the price of a New York City taxi medallion.
   ``For those who insist that history must repeat itself, we would
note that cab medallions are bid at $140,000.''

<HEAD>Grains Higher On Word of Soviet Interest in Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened higher this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices rose in early trading as word swept the floor that
the Soviet Union was in the market for spring wheat. However, wheat
futures drifted downward as trading picked up.
   Corn futures received a boost from heavy rains yesterday in Ohio
and Indiana. The rain could further delay the planting of corn
crops in those states.
   Corn futures were also getting support from good cash prices,
said John Frazier, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in
Chicago.
   Soybean prices were being helped by the weakening dollar.
Analysts say the surge in the dollar's value in recent weeks slowed
the pace of soybean exports.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 2} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.94 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
2{ cents higher with July at $2.66 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{
cents higher with July at $1.74{ a bushel; soybeans were a \ cent
to 7 cents higher wtih July at $7.08{ a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent lower to .17 cent higher with June at
69.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .20 cent lower
with August at 77.65 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .47 cent
lower with June at 47.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.62 to .80 cent lower with July at 31.37 cents a pound.
   Livestock prices settled mostly higher Thursday and pork futures
were lower.

   AT&amp;T and its unions today reported progress in
their contract talks, with the company amending its benefits
package and the unions making a number of counter offers as the
Saturday expiration of current pacts drew closer.
   ``There's been a lot more movement today than there was
(Thursday),'' Communications Workers of American spokeswoman
Francine Zucker said. ``I think we're going to get very close and
we may reach a settlement, but that can change quickly.''
   Still to be resolved are major differences over wages and a
company demand that workers pay more for health care.
   ``We are not as far apart as we were but we're nowhere near
where we want to be,'' Ms. Zucker said.
   The company, moving to answer some of the unions' job-security
concerns, amended its contract offer to include limits on the use
of temporary workers, an AT&amp;T spokeswoman said.
   The company also proposed several changes to its benefits
package, spokeswoman Edith Herman said as negotiators for the
company and two unions continued talks aimed at reaching a new
contract before current pacts for about 160,000 workers expire
Saturday.
   Ms. Herman could not provide specifics of the new company
proposals but said American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was offering to
regulate the use of temporary help, improvements to its eye and
dental care programs, a more liberal leave policy to care for
newborn babies and a new leave program to care for sick relatives.
   Ms. Zucker said those proposals were being reviewed and that the
unions likely would make counter offers later today.
   On Thursday, the unions renewed their attack on AT&amp;T's health
care proposal, which would shift some costs to employers but leave
in place existing caps on the maximum they would have to pay in a
given year.
   ``AT&amp;T spends megabucks urging Americans to reach out and call
our relatives to make sure they're OK, but the only reaching the
company is doing is into its employees' pockets,'' International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers President Jack Barry said as the
unions accused AT&amp;T of withholding data on its medical care costs.
   But an AT&amp;T spokesman said the company had produced most of the
information requested by the unions and was in the process of
compiling the rest.
   Despite the public optimism, both sides are making extensive
preparations for a strike. Union leaders have hinted they will not
call a walkout immediately but likely would do so if an agreement
is not reached within a week or so after the contracts expire.
   ``A strike remains a weapon but it is a weapon of last resort,''
Ms. Zucker said.
   AT&amp;T, from its New Jersey operations center, is preparing
management ``emergency teams'' to fill in for striking workers if
there is a walkout, and the company has plans in place to complete
all major business installations scheduled for the next five weeks,
spokesman Herb Linnen said.
   Linnen said the breakdown of the workers represented by the
unions was:
   _21,500 long-distance operators.
   _35,500 field and in-house technicians.
   _About 37,000 production workers in factories that make
long-distance switching and transmission equipment, the area of
AT&amp;T operations likely to be hit hardest in the event of a strike.
``It's pretty difficult to run an assembly line if the picket lines
are being honored on a high percentage basis,'' said Linnen, who
said the plants would be kept open nonetheless.
   _About 54,000 other union workers in jobs ranging from clerical,
administrative and sales staff to sales representatives in AT&amp;T
retail sales outlets.
   AT&amp;T's manufacturing of residential phones is done in Singapore
and would not be affected by a strike. Inventory for the equipment
manufactured in the United States is ``sparse,'' Linnen said.
   Linnen sad management personnel would fill in for strikers.
However, he would not provide a breakdown of how they would be
assigned.
   In the event of a strike, customers who directly dial
long-distance calls should experience no significant service
problems, but those needing operator assistance could face delays
at peak hours, union and company officials said.
   AT&amp;T, which holds about 70 percent of the long-distance market,
handles about 80 million calls on a normal business day.
   Ms. Zucker said during a 26-day CWA strike in 1986 ``some of the
managers who replaced operators proved they could do the job,
others did not. They are forced to work double shifts in unfamiliar
jobs, and the added stress would have an impact on the quality of
service.''

<HEAD>Pickens Says He'll Take Fight For Koito To Annual Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMARILLO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   T. Boone Pickens says he will take his
fight for representation on Koito Manufacturing Co.'s board to the
annual meeting of the Japanese auto parts manufacturer.
   ``There's no doubt they don't want an American on the inside,''
Pickens said Thursday. ``We've made it clear that Boone Co. intends
to be a long-term holder, but I'm getting the impression management
and its friends have something to hide.''
   The takeover strategist, who has sought a seat on the board
since his Boone Co. became the company's largest single shareholder
with 20.2 percent of the outstanding stock, complained that on
Wednesday Koito granted a Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
representative a seat on the board although the Japanese company
has just 5.3 percent of the stock.
   Pickens requested three seats on the board, the same number held
by Toyota Motor Co., which has 19.2 percent of stock in Koito.
   He said in a statement the denial ``is sending a clear signal by
Japan's major corporations that they have no respect or interest in
American investors.''
   Spokesman Mark Helmke said the company had first tried to limit
Pickens to sending only one person to the meeting, but has since
agreed to allow him two people so he can bring an interpreter.
   But Helmke said he expected Pickens will try to attend the
meeting with his partners in Boone Co.
   ``I see nothing wrong with Toyota or any other Japanese company
investing in the United States,'' Pickens said. ``But I also
believe investment has to be a two-way street. In today's global
economy, no country can afford to keep other investors and other
manufacturers out for long.
   ``If Japan's corporate leaders don't open up, Japan is going to
get left behind, and I doubt the Japanese public will stand for
that for too long.''
   Since Pickens acquired his stake in Koito, he has been urging
government action to force Japan to open its doors to foreign
investment.
   Helmke said Pickens is encouraged by the Bush administration's
decision Thursday to include Japan on a list of countries who trade
practices are most harmful to the U.S. economy.

<HEAD>Major Developer Upbeat About Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who helped transform America's
cornfields and pastures into the phenomenon known as the shopping
mall says he is upbeat about the future of his industry and the
economy.
   Melvin Simon, who started in the shopping center game 30 years
ago by leasing launderettes and developing small centers anchored
by discount stores, launches his most ambitious project in June
with groundbreaking for the Mall of America. He says the
Bloomington, Minn., mall will be America's largest _ big enough to
include its own enclosed theme park.
   Simon's giant new 4.2 million square-foot Mall of America was
one of the star attractions at the International Council of
Shopping Centers convention in Las Vegas. It shared billing with
other major Simon properties, including a major project he will be
developing in France and a look at the unique renovation of the old
Gimbel's building in New York's famed Herald Square.
   ``I'm very upbeat about the economy,'' Simon said as he stood in
front of his company's booth at the annual conclave for shopping
center developers, builders and retailers. ``Everything goes in
cycles but I feel excited about the future. You don't lease (a
center) depending on today's economy, but on what the future holds.
The glass is half filled.''
   How many shopping centers does Indianapolis-based Melvin Simon &amp;
Associates own or manage?
   Simon turns to an employee standing at his side. He's either
lost track or is testing the employee.
   ``We have 207 centers in 38 states,'' the employee responds.
   Simon smiles.
   The numbers make Simon one of the largest managers and
developers of U.S. shopping centers.
   Not bad for the Brooklyn-born, Bronx-raised son of a tailor who
chose to stay in Indianapolis after a tour of military duty there.
   He convinced brother Herbert to join him in selling space for an
Indianapolis shopping center developer, and in 1960 started his own
company.
   Today, Melvin Simon, 62, is chairman of the company that bears
his name and Herbert, 53, is president. Melvin Simon owns
two-thirds of his company and Forbes magazine estimates his fortune
at $550 million. Herbert owns one-third, with a fortune estimated
at $270 million.
   Melvin Simon says he's always believed centers should be more
than just a place to shop.
   Mall of America, he says, will be witness to that theory.
   Grand opening is scheduled for the fall of 1992. Built on the
site of the old Metropolitan Stadium, it will include four major
anchors, 800 specialty stores, 18 theaters _ and Camp Snoopy.
   The latter will be a 300,000-square-foot theme family
entertainment park created and operated by Knott's Berry Farm of
Buena Park, Calif. The park alone will cost $70 million.
   Phase I of the project will cost $600 million and will cover 78
acres. Included will be a golf course and parking space to
accommodate 13,000 vehicles _ an area the size of 96 football
fields.
   Plans call for developing as much as 9.5 million square feet of
space at Mall of America, including hotels and office space. The
Minnesota project is a joint venture with Triple Five Corporation
of West Edmonton, Alberta. Triple Five pioneered the ``mega-mall''
concept with its 5.2 million square-foot West Edmonton Mall.
   Another project coming on line for the Simons this year will be
A&amp;S Plaza in Manhattan, a $400 million renovation of the old
Gimbel's building. A glass wall on the Avenue of the Americas side
will give pedestrians a view of dozens of stores on seven levels.
   To date, the company has developed 11 million square feet of
shopping center space and manages 72.3 million, with 4,450
employees nationwide, including 1,004 in their Indianapolis
headquarters.
   Currently, the company is adding about three major malls and
eight to 10 smaller centers a year to its inventory.
   Today the company normally doesn't get into a project without
owning it _ either outright or in partnership, such as the case of
Mall of America.
   ``We like to keep them and see them grow, so we become part of
the community,'' Herbert Simon said.
   Community involvement is something the Simons are known for in
Indianpolis.
   When the Indiana Pacers appeared ready to exit the city, the
Simons shelled out $13 million for the pro basketball club, keeping
them there.
   They saved a major downtown Indianapolis landmark by undertaking
a $6 million renovation of the Roof Ballroom, where thousands of
Indianapolis citizens had held proms and weddings.
   Their company will be spending $840 million on Circle Centre, an
effort to remodel and revitalize much of downtown Indianapolis.
   Melvin Simon also has tried his hand at the movies, producing
films such as ``Zorro, the Gay Blade'' and ``Porky's.''
   Other major Simon projects include:
   _ Hollywood Promenade, a planned hotel and shopping complex
developed around Mann's Chinese Theater;
   _ Newport Centre, a 1.2 million square-foot project in Jersey
City, N.J. that includes shopping and residental areas;
   _ Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, a 860,000 square-foot complex
at Arlington, Va. that includes a 450-room hotel, shopping and
office space.
   Abroad, meanwhile, the brothers are joining with a French
consortium to build a 270-acre leisure, retail, convention and
trade center known as Europark in Nice, France. Work is scheduled
to begin next year.
   Figures released at the ICSC convention held in late May show
were were 32,560 U.S. shopping centers in 1988, up from 30,600 the
previous year. Those centers generated $627 billion in retail
sales, up from $586 billion in 1987.

<TEXT>
   In the past two decades the United States has
corrected many of the problems that had weakened its international
competitiveness to the point that entire industries were lost to
upstarts.
   Major manufacturers modernized factories, raised quality,
reintroduced the work ethic, cut white-collar bureaucracies,
learned how to export. Government regulators loosened up, and tax
incentives were introduced.
   But, while America can take bows for having learned from history
and taken action to correct its defects, it has a long way to go,
beginning perhaps with the trade and budget deficits and the
factors underlying them.
   While those items are in the news every day, and something is
being done about them, several other problems of great importance
lie dormant, ready to spring up like jacks in the box.
   There is, for instance, the massive question of guiding the
economy.
   The Federal Reserve's faithful weapon against emerging inflation
is to clamp down on the money supply, thus putting upward pressure
on interest rates. It is an effective tool, but many critics see it
as a bludgeon, not a scalpel.
   For example, one of the indicators of inflation used by the Fed
is capacity utilization by the nation's factories. When that
percentage reaches 85, as it almost did earlier this year,
inflation is said to be a real threat.
   Whatever capacity exists beyond that point is thought to be less
efficient, Less efficient production is more costly production, and
more costly production forces industry to raise its prices to
buyers.
   The Fed's approach has been to lessen demand on the factories by
raising interest rates high enough to discourage buyers. Slack is
created, and the least efficient facilities can be retired from use.
   Wait a minute, say the critics. Won't higher interest rates cut
into the capital commitments necessary to increase capacity?
Wouldn't it be wiser of the Fed to see if it could create slack by
encouraging growth in capacity?
   Big questions, but little is ever done about them. Some critical
economists and business people have been arguing the position for
decades, to no avail.
   Also without resolution _ probably to remain so until another
crisis _ is the oil conflict. Are Americans willing to pay higher
prices for oil? Ask the question anywhere and the answer is a
unanimous ``no.''
   But _ Americans also are becoming re-attracted to bigger cars.
Relations with oil-producing nations, such as Iran, are tenuous.
And nobody gets more outraged at ecological damage than do
Americans.
   The nation has no official position on this enormous economic
threat, which can become a sudden reality because of military
actions, oil spills, platform explosions or OPEC decisions.
   Just as oil can break the economy, health care could also. When
lives are involved it is difficult to apply cost restraints,
especially in a profession where the ethic is to do everything
possible to maintain or improve life.
   Attempts to impose business discipline on and by providers of
health care, insurers and users have helped, but the problem
remains. An aging population, rising health-care wages and
scientific equipment contribute mightily.
   Because of these and other factors, health care remained in an
inflationary mode throughout the 1980s, even while general
inflation receded to under 5 percent. And there is little prospect
for controlling that inflation.
   Housing for the poor belongs in the same category of problems.
   A variety of factors have driven up housing prices, important
among them being a spurt in land costs, community restrictions and
environmental concerns. These are among the costs passed on to
buyers who can afford them.
   Housing for the poor, however, has never been profitable without
government assistance in one form or another. Tax benefits have
been used effectively in the past, as have relaxation of zoning or
other inhibitions to building.
   Those tax benefits, however, were greatly reduced in the tax
reformation of 1986. No longer is it profitable, or as profitable,
for investors to put their money into massive construction projects.
   Thus, while single-family home construction has remained strong,
building of multifamily dwellings has plunged. If anything, the
housing situation for the poor has deteriorated rather than
improved.

   Unlike beer guzzlers who dash off to
the store for quick gratification, Lawrence Snyder's customers are
willing to wait up to eight weeks to savor their favorite brew.
   Snyder owns Brew and Wine Hobby in East Hartford, where beer
aficionados can buy everything from the hops, malts and barley to
the siphons, containers and bottles needed to brew their own beer.
   ``It spoils you forever and commercial beers never taste the
same again,'' Snyder said.
   His store, where 25 brands of malt share space with beer mixes
from around the world, is one of perhaps 1,200 across the country
catering to the growing number of Americans who prefer their own
brew to commercial lagers, ales and stouts, according to the
American Homebrewers Association in Boulder, Colo.
   ``There is some work involved, but the satisfaction you get in
the end is worth it,'' said Everett Stone, a computer analyst and
Snyder customer, who has been brewing his own since 1982. ``You can
give it your own personal touch.''
   Home-brewing has only been legal in the United States since
1979. A survey commissioned by Boots of England, a British
drugstore chain, found there were about 1.4 million home-brewers in
the United States as of 1984, the last figures available.
   Home-brewers produce an average 4.5 gallons or two cases of beer
a month and spend about $250 a year on supplies, statistics
compiled by the Homebrewers Association show.
   Snyder, who admits that he actually prefers homemade wine to
beer, got into the home-brewing business by accident. He had lost
his job as an English professor and happened to be in the store
buying some wine-making equipment for his own hobby when the owner
offered him a job as manager in 1972.
   The next year, he bought out the owner, a Pratt &amp; Whitney
engineer who operated the store as a lucrative hobby. Snyder added
home-brewing supplies after it became legal.
   The brewing process, from initial boiling to final bottling and
aging, takes six to eight weeks.
   It begins with the mixing of malt and boiling water for between
15 minutes for light beer or an hour for the heavier, darker stouts.
   Next comes a five-to-seven day fermentation process, when yeast
is added to convert sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide. Alcohol
content depends on how long it ferments.
   The home-brew is then siphoned from the primary container to a
secondary one where it remains until bottling.
   Prior to bottling, the home-brew is primed, when sugar is added
to help produce carbonation. After bottling, the home-brew must age
two to four weeks before it is ready to drink.
   Daniel Bradford, marketing director for the American Homebrewers
Association, said home-brewing has become painless with the
introduction of canned ingredients imported from Europe that allow
home-brewers to duplicate their favorite import, such as a John
Bull lager or a Tom Caxton Scottish ale.
   ``Supplies are readily available and directions have been
debugged so thoroughly they are foolproof,'' Bradford said.
   Bradford says increased interest in home-brewing also stems from
renewed emphasis on homemade products.
   ``People are interested in cocooning _ doing things at home _
and you can see that in the increased interest in gardening,''
Bradford said. ``The increased interest in gardening is somewhat
analogous to home-brewing.''
   Some home-brewers say they were drawn to their hobby as much by
their wallets as their palates. A can of John Bull lager mix can
produce five gallons of beer or about two-and-a-half cases for as
little as a $1.10 a six-pack. Imported beers retail for between $1
and $2 a bottle.
   ``My motivation was that English beer is difficult to come by
(in the United States) and it is expensive,'' said Mick A. Cogdon
of Enfield, Conn., a 39-year-old sales representatives. ``With
home-brewing you can keep the alcohol down, which lowers calories
and means you can drink more.''
   Snyder said many customers choose home-brew over such homemade
products as wine because it is quicker and easier to make. It is
also a year-round hobby, while the wine-making season runs from
September to November.
   ``First of all we're a beer-drinking society and we want instant
gratification or at least in the not too distant future,'' Snyder
said. ``Wine is very seasonal and takes more skill to make and
requires a longer aging process.''

<HEAD>NTT's Profits Drop in Face of Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone Corp. said Friday its earnings fell last year as it
faced the fiercest competition it has seen since becoming a private
business.
   NTT, which began its conversion from a government monoply to
private ownership four years ago, posted a 5.2 percent decline in
net income and a 14.3 percent drop in unconsolidated pretax profits
for the fiscal year ended March 31.
   Company officials attributed the drop in profits to lower
long-distance revenue caused by competition from new entrants in
the market, and to a slump in revenue from data communications
services.
   It said its net income fell to 230.6 billion yen, or $1.8
billion, while pretax profits dropped to 425.9 billion yen, or
$3.28 billion, from 496.7 billion yen the previous year.
   Total operating revenue fell 0.2 percent to 5.65 trillion yen,
or $43.48 billion, the company said.
   ``Fiscal 1989 was really the initial year of real competition in
the market. For the first three years after privatization ... we
continued to enjoy monopoly status because our competitors had not
yet started to offer services,'' said Osamu Kajima, deputy manager
of the accounting department, at a news conference.
   As Japan's largest company, NTT has attracted international
attention in the course of its transformation from government
monopoly to semi-private company over the past four years.
   The company was a stock market star in 1987, when the first
portion of its stock was offered to the public. In April 1987, two
months after the stock was offered, a single share of the company
was worth 3.18 million yen, the equivalent of about $24,100.
   Twenty-five percent of shares have been offered on the market,
with the government still holding the remainder.
   But recently the company has fallen on hard times. Its
hard-driving chairman, Hisashi Shinto, resigned last December after
being implicated in the Recruit scandal, and was arrested in March
on bribery charges.
   Competition also has forced NTT to lower its long distance
rates, cutting into profits. Kajima said rate cuts cost NTT 110
billion yen in long distance charges last year.
   Its local telephone services still run large deficits, and it no
longer can rely on its formerly overpriced long-distance services
to make up the difference.
   NTT stock closed at 1.51 million yen Friday, below the 1.6
million yen price it was offered at when the company was first
listed.

<HEAD>Foreign Activity Goes Long Way To Explain Bond Movements</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the U.S. bond market rallies, you can
usually thank West Germans, Japanese, Britons and other foreigners.
   At the end of 1988, foreigners held an estimated $634 billion in
U.S. debt, or about 5.6 percent of the $11.3 trillion in
outstanding credit market debt. Last year alone, foreigners pumped
about $106 billion into the U.S. credit market, according to
Federal Reserve statistics.
   So when the bond market rallied recently on the newfound
strength of the U.S. dollar overseas, foreign investment was a
major reason. A host of negative economic and political news in
West Germany, Japan and Britain also played a role.
   The reason? When things aren't going well abroad and U.S.
economic signs are being viewed in a positive light,
dollar-denominated securities become a good investment for
foreigners.
   ``They've turned on the buy signal,'' said Robert Brusca, chief
economist for Nikko Securities International Inc. in New York.
   ``There has been buying of both stocks and bonds,'' he said.
``(Foreigners) have to buy dollars to do that, and they've been
doing that.''
   When the dollar soared last week to a 29-month high against the
West German mark and a 19-month high against the Japanese yen,
foreign investors scrambled to buy U.S. bonds.
   The stock bribery scandal in Japan that has led to Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita's resignation and domestic political
pressures on West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also have weakened
confidence in those countries.
   And with central banks in West Germany and Japan pondering
whether to raise interest rates in an attempt to stave off the
rising dollar but still taking no action, U.S. bonds remained
attractive.
   The Bank of England boosted its base lending rate a full point
to 14 percent in the middle of last week, fueling speculation that
Japan and West Germany would follow suit, and bond prices backed
off a bit. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
   ``The stronger dollar is a confidence builder for the foreign
investor, but if the dollar rises at too rapid a rate it raises
doubts about durability,'' said John Lonski, senior economist at
Moody's Investors Service.
   A shaky economic climate in West Germany and Japan could spur a
tightening of monetary policy.
   In West Germany, the outlook on inflation has been bleak with
high oil prices and a weak mark. In Japan, import prices have
increased rapidly and the yen has sunk, but government officials
there have said no change in monetary policy is yet warranted.
   The initial impact of an interest rate hike by the Bundesbank or
Bank of Japan would reduce the need of the Fed to ease monetary
policy and bring down the value of the dollar, which could reduce
the foreign binge on U.S. bonds.
   The Fed raised interest rates this spring to curb inflation and
economic growth. But with most U.S. economic indicators pointing to
a slowdown, another increase has been viewed as unlikely for now.
   ``Foreign bondholders will find that because of policy changes
in the United States directed at curbing domestic consumption and
increasing exports, the dollar will be worth more in terms of
foreign securities,'' Lonski said.
   Because of huge U.S. trade deficits, foreign holdings of U.S.
debt have increased at average annual rate of 18.9 percent since
the early-1980s, Lonski said.
   As long as the United States imports more than it exports,
foreigners can be expected to continue to loan billions to the
country in the form of debt securities.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower in sluggish trading on the Chicago Board of Trade Friday as
uncertainty over the weather and the Memorial Day weekend held down
activity.
   Soybean futures were mixed, with the July contract higher on
reports of heavy trading in Europe of soybean oil and soybean meal.
   ``There is some talk that a number of countries will be
purchasing soybean oil and soybean meal, including the Soviet
Union,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc.

   Uncertainty over the whether put a damper on most of the market.
National Weather Service Forecasts for next week calls for average
or above-average rain for major crop-producing states.
   Corn futures received a slight boost from heavy rains Thursday
in Ohio and Indiana. The rain could further delay the planting of
corn crops in those states.
   Wheat futures were lower, despite an upswing in exports and
unconfirmed reports the Soviets are in the market for about 300,000
metric tons of red wheat.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 5 cents lower with the

   The price of Avon Products Inc. stock bobbed up
again Friday after word of Mary Kay Corp.'s interest in the
cosmetics company resurfaced.
   Speculators bought Avon stock on the possibility that Mary Kay
or another suitor might engage in a relentless pursuit of Avon,
which last week rejected a $2.1 billion takeover bid from Amway
Corp.
   Avon shares gained $1.87{ a share, rising to $37 by midafternoon
as 1.42 million shares changed hands on the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Buyers were motivated by release of a letter sent to Avon
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James E. Preston in which John
P. Rochon, vice chairman of Mary Kay Corp., expressed interest in
acquiring Avon.
   The letter, made public Thursday night, contained no details of
the financial aspects of a possible bid, which had been mentioned
in previous news accounts but never publicly confirmed by
Dallas-based Mary Kay.
   Rochon stated the letter was being released so its sales force
would have information about the matter.
   Avon spokesman John Cox said the company would have no comment
on Mary Kay's interest until after it was discussed at a regularly
scheduled board meeting June 1.
   Wall Street securities analysts were uncertain whether Avon
would feel more inclined toward accepting a bid from Mary Kay than
it did toward Amway's advances. In turning down Amway's $39-a-share
offer, Avon blasted its direct selling rival as a totally
unsuitable match and criticized Amway on moral and ethical grounds.
   One of the principle complaints Avon had was the difference in
style between the two direct sellers, which Avon contended would
result in a culture clash that could ruin business.
   In a letter informing Amway that its board had rejected Amway's
proposal, Avon characterized its own 1.4 million sales
representatives as ``friendly'' and ``caring'' with a ``gracious
manner.'' By contrast, Avon accused Amway of fostering zealotry and
high-pressures selling tactics.
   Mary Kay, meanwhile, was apparently anxious to dispel any
misgivings Avon might have about the compatability of the two
companies.
   The letter from Rochon said that if the two companies united,
Mary Kay and Avon each would maintain separate sales forces and
identities.
   ``I do believe _ as you do _ that each company's sales force has
developed a `culture' of its own _ cultures which best remain
distinct,'' Rochon stated.
   He added, however, that the two cultures share the same
underlying values and therefore the management approach ``which has
proved valuable in motivating Mary Kay's sales force to produce
substantial growth will be transferable to Avon.''
   Rochon said an investor group he heads called Argonaut Partners,
which includes Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc., the main holding of
privately-held Mary Kay Corp., has been working with First Boston
Corp. as a financial adviser. A spokeswoman for Mary Kay said she
wasn't at liberty to disclose the partners.
   One takeover stock specialist said the link with First Boston, a
major merger and acquisition investment house, might indicate the
Mary Kay-led investor group intends to wage a dogged attempt to get
control of Avon.
   However, this investor, who spoke on condition that his name not
be used, said Wall Street was reluctant to push Avon shares much
higher because there is a perception Avon's management is
determined to keep the company independent.
   Earlier this week, Avon shares got a lift from a published
report that investor Irwin L. Jacobs and an unidentified major
company planned to launch a joint bid for Avon at $40 a share.
   USA Today reported Jacobs and the unidentified company were in
the process of completing financing and other details of the
hostile offer. Jacobs' partner was said to be a company other than

   Stock prices advanced broadly today, aided by
new declines in interest rates.
   Activity tapered off through the day as many traders got an
early start on the long Memorial Day weekend. The markets will be
closed on Monday.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term
government bonds rose more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value,
reducing their yields to the 8.6 percent-8.65 percent range.
   Analysts said stocks benefited from expectations that the recent
downturn in rates might have further to go, with encouragement from
the Federal Reserve.
   The economy has showed signs of slowing lately, as Fed
policymakers have intended. Furthermore, some observers think the
central bank might want to ease credit in order to slow the recent
sharp rise of the dollar in foreign exchange.

   Japan and India reacted angrily and leveled
countercharges against the United States on Friday after being
named along with Brazil as serious fair-trade violators possibly
subject to stiff retaliatory tariffs.
   The Brazilian government also denied allegations of unfair trade
practices and a top presidential aide in Brasilia said the nation
would present ``solid arguments in its defense.''
   The Bush administration on Thursday listed countries with trade
barriers most harmful to American producers, as required by the
1988 Omnibus Trade Act. The government has 18 months to negotiate
away the barriers and failure of the talks could lead to tariffs of
up to 100 percent on selected exports from the offenders.
   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno summoned U.S. Ambassador Michael
Armacost to deliver a protest in Tokyo and the government said
there were errors in U.S. complaints about alleged barriers to
sales of supercomputers, satellites and forest products in Japan.
   Uno and other Cabinet ministers said the U.S. action was
``extremely regrettable'' and officials indicated Japan would
refuse to participate in talks sought by the United States to end
the alleged practices.
   ``This designation in no way possesses legal binding force in
the international trade system,'' said Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, minister
of international trade and industry.
   India was cited for barriers against foreign investment and the
closing of its insurance market to foreign companies. The
administration cited Brazil for quotas on imports and licensing
restrictions.
   ``We regard this law and action under it as totally unjustified,
irrational and unfair,'' India's Commerce Minister Dinesh Singh
said in New Delhi.
   ``The United States' action is particularly surprising because
the U.S. Itself has built and retained a variety of barriers
against access to its markets,'' Singh said. ``It is hardly in a
position to ask others to lift barriers without doing so itself.''
   In Brasilia, Ronaldo Costa Couto, the chief of staff of
President Jose Sarney, said in a radio interview that Sarney was
``concerned'' about the U.S. decision but said, ``Brazil has solid
arguments in its defense.''
   All three nations have trade surpluses with the United States,
led by Japan's $52 billion surplus. India had a $700 million
surplus with the United States in 1988, while the most recent
figures available from Brazil indicate that nation's U.S. exports
totaled $8.54 billion last year and U.S. imports in the first 11
months of 1988 totaled $2.74 billion.
   Last year, U.S. exports to Japan rose 33.7 percent to $37.7
billion and the bilateral trade deficit shrank by $4.4 billion,
according to U.S. statistics. But Japanese exports surged this
year, increasing political pressure for Washington to take action
under the trade law.
   Mitsuzuka described U.S. trade policy as ``to threaten other
countries into negotiating by brandishing the threat of unilateral
sanctions.''
   He said the policy was contrary to the principles of the
multinational General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, and
could undermine the existing multilateral free trade system and
ongoing Uruguay Round of GATT.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Japan would agree
to ``quiet talks'' that might coincide with U.S. demands under the
1988 trade law. He also said Japan might complain to GATT if the
United States imposed sanctions.
   Japan has taken steps to open its markets, Uno said, denying
that the specific U.S. complaints ``can be considered to constitute
trade barriers.''
   ``I strongly regret the lack of fairness because the United
States has unilaterally made such a decision...despite the fact
that the U.S. itself maintains import-restrictive measures and
practices to a considerable degree,'' Uno said.
   Takuma Yamamoto, president of supercomputer maker Fujitsu Ltd.,
said the computer market in Japan ``has been totally freed'' and
the government policy on buying supercomputers _ contrary to the
U.S. complaint _ is not to discriminate between foreign and
domestic producers.
   He said U.S. supercomputers have 15 percent of the Japanese
market while Japanese supercomputers have only 2 percent of the
U.S. market. No Japanese supercomputer ever has been bought by a
U.S. public organization, Yamamoto said.
   The government also said sales of U.S. forestry products in
Japan had doubled from 1986 to 1988, and the minister of posts and
telecommunications, Seiichi Kataoka, noted Japan was buying five
American satellites this year.
   India last year exported about $3.2 billion worth of goods to
the United States, it's biggest trading partner, primarily
clothing, diamonds, crude oil and cashews.
   Anwarul Hoda, joint secretary in the Commerce Ministry, said
India's trade surplus with the United States only started in 1983
and had dropped sharply from $1 billion in 1987 to $700 million in
1988.

<HEAD>More Vacationers Driving, Taking Shorter Trips</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA MARTINEZ</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Vacationers are expected to drive more this summer than last
despite the recent jump in gasoline prices but will take shorter
trips, according to travel industry groups.
   Motor vehicles will account for nearly 83 percent of all summer
travel, with 273 million vacationers expected to travel the
nation's roads and highways in the 14-week period between Memorial
Day and Labor Day, a 4 percent increase over 1988.
   ``The sharp increases in gasoline prices since March 1989,
although higher than usual for the pre-summer travel season, are
not expected to be a serious deterrent to auto vacation travel this
summer,'' the Washington, D.C.-based U.S. Travel Data Center says.
The center's data are based on a national telephone survey of 1,500
households.
   Retail gasoline prices have risen an average of 17.4 cents a
gallon since Easter weekend, the steepest rise between holidays
since Christmas 1979 and Easter 1980, when prices jumped 19 cents a
gallon, according to the American Automobile Association.
   The average retail cost of a gallon of gasoline is $1.254, with
actual costs varying between cities, states and regions and
self-serve or full-service stations.
   Air travel is expected to remain relatively stable at last
summer's level representing about 15 percent of all vacation
travel, while bus and train travel, which represents 1 percent, is
expected to be at capacity.
   Airline fares increased far more than motor fuel in the first
quarter of 1989 _ 6.2 percent versus 2.5 percent _ but
second-quarter motor fuel prices have leaped more than 16 percent,
due to a combination of factors, including the Alaska oil spill and
the strong rise in crude oil prices since January, according to AAA.
   Overall summer vacation travel is expected to rise about 3
percent from last year, with vacationers generally opting for
shorter trips, industry surveys indicate.
   More than half of all summer travelers will make round trips of
500 miles or less, according to AAA. Average domestic miles
traveled are projected to decline to 920 from 970 last summer.
   ``America wants to travel more than ever and its people are
going to satisfy this desire even if the demands of time and
two-income families are forcing them to take three- and four-day
trips in place of one- and two-week vacations,'' said Suzanne Cook,
director of the AAA data center.
   According to the center's survey, the volume of day trips and
trips of up to three nights will rise 7 percent and comprise more
than half of all summer vacation travel.
   Overall travel prices were up 4.5 percent during the first
quarter of this year compared with last year, according to the data
center. Transportation and lodging costs were up 4.1 percent, food
and beverage costs up 4.6 percent and entertainment up 5.6 percent.

<HEAD>University Aims to Make Theory-Based Curriculum More Practical</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI PRASSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at the University of Chicago's Graduate
School of Business might be at a disadvantage when they land jobs
because of the school's theory-based curriculum, according to a
report released Friday.
   The internal study recommends changing teaching methods to focus
on practical applications.
   ``You try to develop the disciplines underlying business
management, but then you have to follow through and show how they
are applied,'' Kenneth French, professor of finance and chairman of
a 12-member advisory committee, said.
   The panel surveyed the student body and conducted interviews
with recruiters, alumni and focus groups of students and faculty
members. The group received responses from more than 1,350 of its
full- and part-time students.
   Students ``feel that their education would be improved if the
faculty put more emphasis on the business applications of concepts,
theories and empirical evidence we teach,'' the report said.
   While the analytical approach emphasizes well-defined problems
with well-defined answers, students are confronted by ambiguous
problems with no ``right'' answers in the workplace.
   ``Thus, they may not be as well prepared to deal with some of
the demands of their initial job as graduates from other business
schools,'' it said.
   The study was prompted by a BusinessWeek magazine survey
published last fall that ranked Chicago's business school No. 11 in
the nation. Northwestern University's J.L. Kellogg Graduate School
of Management was ranked first.
   ``We didn't do as well as we would have liked,'' said John P.
Gould, dean of Chicago's business school. ``It's not where we have
been traditionally. It is not the quality of this faculty,'' which
includes a number of Nobel Prize-wnning economists and presidential
advisors.
   ``I think we're closer to second or third or first,'' Gould said.
   The report recommended more interaction outside of class between
faculty and students. It also suggested appointing coordinators to
improve weaker courses.
   In addition, the report recommended cutting the number of
full-time MBA candidates by 10 percent. ``Part of our problem is
overcrowding,'' French said. ``And size also works against a sense
of community.''
   Currently the school has 1,123 full-time MBA students, up from
521 in 1970. There also are more than 1,000 part-time students
pursuing MBAs.
   Tuition for full-time MBA candidates will be $15,500 next year,
or $1,550 a course, based on a 10-course school year. Part-time
students pay the same per course fee.

   The dollar continued sliding off the highs it
reached earlier this week but finished mixed in a choppy domestic
session Friday after falling overseas.
   The dollar was the center of a tug-of-war between central banks
from around the world, which joined forces to push it lower, and
traders who viewed a lower dollar as a buying opportunity.
   Thin volume ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend heightened
the dollar's volatility. Most traders spent the day squaring their
positions to protect themselves in the event interest rates rose
overseas when U.S. markets are closed Monday.
   ``Nobody wants to be exposed too much in the dollar over the
weekend,'' said Jack Barbanel, a senior vice president at Gruntal &amp;
Co.
   In London, one dealer complained ``the market had no depth,''
and said many players there finished trading at midday. British
markets also will be closed for a holiday Monday.
   The dollar opened lower in U.S. trading on rumors that Japan was
about to hike its discount rate by 0.75 percent and was further
pressured by talk of a West German rate hike.
   Traders had expected the dollar to retreat from the highs posted
earlier this week. The currency smashed the 2-mark level for the
first time in two and a half years on Monday and finished New York
trading at 2.0115 marks two days later, when it also surged to
close at 143 Japanese yen.
   But the central banks took notice of the gains. ``For the first
time in a long time we've seen coordinated central bank
intervention by even the smaller countries,'' Barbanel said.
   Also, U.S. officials earlier this week spoke out against the
dollar's climb in an effort to stem further increases.
   But when the central banks sold dollars at Friday's lows in an
attempt to depress the currency further, traders viewed it as a
buying opportunity, said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   While the intervention may have been effective over the course
of the week, Flanagan said it failed Friday. ``The dollar just held
at major support points,'' he said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 140.40 yen, down from Thursday's
close of 142.35 yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at
140.30 yen. In New York the dollar fell to 141.10 yen from 141.23
yen late Thursday.
   In London, the British pound traded at $1.5922, up from $1.5815
late Thursday. But later in New York, sterling dipped to $1.5905
from Thursday's $1.5910.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.9835 West German marks, up from
1.9800; 1.7310 Swiss francs, down from 1.7425; 6.7160 French
francs, up from 6.7035; 1,433.75 Italian lire, down from 1,444.50,
and 1.2015 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2068.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.9675 West German marks, down from 1.9965; 1.7155 Swiss
francs, down from 1.7650; 6.6625 French francs, down from 6.7675;
2.2150 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2480; 1,421.75 Italian lire,
down from 1,444.50, and 1.2035 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2105.
   Gold prices fell after finishing mixed overseas. Republic
National Bank of New York said the late bid for a troy ounce of
gold was $363.75, compared with $365.90 Thursday.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $366.00 a troy ounce from $367.00 on Thursday.
   Gold was trading in London at a late bid of $363.75 a troy
ounce, down from $364.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose 25
cents to close at a bid of $364.50. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose
$1.55 an ounce to a closing bid of $366.41.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery
finished at $5.252 a troy ounce, down from $5.267 on Thursday.
Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.27 a troy ounce, from
$5.26 bid late Thursday.

<HEAD>General Foods Fires Ogilvy, Hires D'Arcy for Maxwell House Coffee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Foods USA said Friday it had fired
Ogilvy &amp; Mather as the advertising agency for its Maxwell House
coffee brand, which Ogilvy has touted for 31 years as being ``Good
to the last drop.''
   The food company said that following a review of several months
it was awarding the account valued at more than $50 million to
D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, another New York-based ad agency.
   The switch comes after Maxwell House lost its longstanding
position as the biggest selling domestic coffee brand to Procter &amp;
Gamble's Folgers.
   ``This was a tough call that in the final analysis was based
strongly on strategy and creative recommendations,'' Ray Viault,
president of Maxwell House said in a statement from company
headquarters at White Plains, N.Y.
   The account loss comes as a blow to Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the largest
U.S. unit of the Ogilvy Group. Ogilvy Group management recently
accepted an $864 million buyout offer from Britain's WPP Group PLC,
another advertising giant.
   However, both General Foods and Ogilvy &amp; Mather said the pending
takeover had nothing to do with the Maxwell House account switch.
They said the agency review started months before the WPP deal was
negotiated.
   ``It's a tough blow,'' said Ogilvy Chairman Kenneth Roman. ``We
thought we did a very good job, but they thought the other agency
did a better job.''
   Roman declined to speculate whether the account loss would lead
to layoffs at the agency, which has handled Maxwell House since
1958.
   Ogilvy &amp; Mather has other major assignments from General Foods,
including Post cereals and Tang and Country Time beverages and
several assignments for coffee and other products overseas.
   The account win is the second major victory for D'Arcy in two
weeks. Miami-based Burger King Corp. tapped D'Arcy and Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Advertising to split its $200 million-plus account on May
18.
   Clayton Wilhite, president of the U.S. division of D'Arcy,
congratulated the agency's employees in a memo for what was
``arguably the two biggest back-to-back new assignments in industry
history.''
   D'Arcy has worked with General Foods since 1929 and creates
adverrtsiing for its Cool Whip topping and Good Seasons salad
dressing.
   The Maxwell House brand has been losing ground in the shrinking
U.S. coffee market in recent years.
   John McMillin, food industry analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities, said Maxwell House lost its long-standing ranking as
the biggest selling brand in the U.S. coffee market to Folgers.
   He said Maxwell House's share of the $3.9 billion market fell to
25 percent in 1988 from just over 27 percent of a $4.1 billion
market in 1987, while Folgers' share rose to 27.9 percent from 27
percent.
   McMillin said the new managers at General Foods, which has
become part of the Kraft General Foods Group at Philip Morris Cos.
Inc., are intent on reestablishing Maxwell House as the
best-selling coffee brand.
   ``A new ad agency may give the brand a little bit of life,'' he
said.
   While Ogilvy has used the ``Good to the last drop'' slogan in
its Maxwell House advertising, General Foods credits Theodore
Roosevelt for coining the phrase decades earlier.
   The company said Roosevelt used the phrase to describe coffee at
the Maxwell House hotel in Nashville where it is believed the brand
was born.
   Among Ogilvy's more recent ads for Maxwell House have been
commercials featuring commentator Linda Ellerbee and weatherman
Willard Scott touting results of recent taste tests that compared
Maxwell House and Folgers.
   Ogilvy got some encouraging news Friday despite the Maxwell
House account loss. Cotton Inc., a New York-based concern
representing cotton growers that had considered moving its account
in the wake of the WPP deal, said it had decided to keep its $10
million assignment at Ogilvy.

   Renewed declines in interest rates provided the
fuel for a broad pre-holiday rally in the stock market Friday.
   Activity tapered off through the session as many traders got an
early start on the long Memorial Day weekend. The markets will be
closed on Monday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.18 to 2,493.77,
cutting its loss for the week to 7.33 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,019 up, 409 down and 532 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 143.12 million
shares, down from 154.47 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 169.86 million shares.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term
government bonds rose more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value,
reducing their yields to the 8.6 percent-8.65 percent range.
   Analysts said stocks benefited from expectations that the recent

   Sea Containers Ltd. jumped 9| to 57|. The European companies
Tiphook PLC and Stena AB made a $50-a-share offer for Sea
Containers, and traders quickly bid up the price in anticipation of
a possible higher offer.
   Avon Products rose 1| to 36}. An official of Mary Kay Corp. said
he and a group of investors remain interested in acquiring Avon,
which recently warded off a hostile takeover bid by Amway Corp.
   Rorer Group, which said it was amenable to a merger if the right
partner could be found, climbed 3] to 41\.
   National Education fell 2] to 21[. The company said it may post
flat or lower earnings for the second quarter.
   Texaco led the active list, down 1[ at 55 on turnover of about
5.5 million shares. Brokers said much of the activity represented
maneuvering by traders in advance of a $4-a-share special dividend
to be paid to holders of record June 5.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $22.20 billion, or
0.71 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.26 to 179.31.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.69 to 369.19, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.42 at 321.59.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

   AT&amp;T and its unions reported progress Friday
in a hectic day of negotiations, but remaining disputes over wages
and particularly health benefits left in doubt whether a new
contract could be settled before a Saturday night deadline.
   ``Things have started to heat up,'' said Francine Zucker, a
spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America. ``I think
we're going to get very close and we may reach a settlement but
that can change quickly.''
   Ms. Zucker and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph officials said
both sides were exchanging offers and counter-offers in the
fastest-paced day of negotiating since the talks opened in late
March.
   ``It is true that we are making progress in some areas but
clearly there are still some issues, significant issues, to be
resolved,'' said AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen. ``We remain optimistic
that those hurdles can be overcome.''
   Union AT&amp;T workers nationwide staged a five-minute work stoppage
at 4:15 p.m. EDT Friday in a show of union solidarity.
   In the talks, AT&amp;T officials said, the company offered to limit
its use of temporary workers, a key union job-security demand.
   Still, it would take a major breakthrough to resolve the pay and
health benefits disputes, and both sides were preparing for a
possible strike when the current contracts for about 160,000
workers expire at 11:59 p.m. EDT Saturday.
   Sources close to the talks said AT&amp;T, which earlier this week
proposed having employees pay more at first for health care,
proposed in an informal meeting among top officials from both sides
to revise the offer. Neither side would discuss details. But a
union official said, ``It was a reconfiguration of the existing
offer and it is unacceptable.'' Both sides have characterized
health benefits as the issue most likely to prevent settlement.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed with the
public statements of progress but cautioned that the negotiations
were at a volatile stage and could turn for the worse. In an
arrangement likely to be repeated Saturday, formal negotiating
committees met at a Washington hotel while the two union presidents
and AT&amp;T's top negotiator held periodic meetings on the major
issues.
   Whether the unions _ the CWA and the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers _ would immediately call a strike remained
unclear.
   If a contract agreement appears at hand at the deadline, the
unions likely would agree to negotiate for another day or two. Even
if major barriers remain, union officials have said they might not
immediately strike and instead might try other strategies,
including a nationwide labor boycott of AT&amp;T's long-distance
service.
   ``We won't make that call until Saturday,'' Ms. Zucker said.
   Both sides have throughout the talks expressed hope a settlement
would be reached before the current contracts expire, but Friday
marked the first time both sides reported significant progress.
   In addition to offering to regulate use of temporary workers,
AT&amp;T has amended and expanded its contract proposal to improve eye
and dental care and its parental leave policy. Also, it has
proposed for the first time allowing leave for workers to care for
sick relatives.
   Those proposals are in addition to the formal offer the company
made Monday, a package which provided varying base wage increases
and lump sum payments depending on job classification and also a
new profit-sharing plan for union workers. Also included was a
proposal to make employees pay more up front for health care,
although current caps on how much a worker might have to spend in a
year would remain in effect. AT&amp;T also proposed a lifetime benefits
cap of $1 million.
   The unions are seeking expanded medical benefits at no
additional costs to workers and say they have proposed cost-cutting
ideas that would meet AT&amp;T's concerns about its rising health care
bill, which hit $1 billion last year.

<HEAD>Chicago Merc, Board of Trade Aim to Unify After-Hours Trading Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade have agreed to try to unify their planned
after-hours electronic trading systems, the two announced jointly
on Friday.
   The announcement comes as a marked turnaround for the Board of
Trade, which has been highly critical of the Merc's planned Globex
system and last fall recommended that the federal government deny
the Merc permission to operate it.
   The CBOT at the time said the Merc's system would be difficult
to operate and susceptible to abuse. The CBOT has been making plans
for an after-hours electronic trading system of its own, called
Aurora.
   However, ``multiple trading systems place economic and
technological demands upon market users which increase the cost of
doing business,'' the two trading organizations said Friday in
their statement.
   ``The CBOT and the (Merc) are committed to offering their
members and trading public the best markets at the lowest cost
while preserving their unrivaled liquidity,'' the statement said.
   Successful discussions on unifying systems, along with approval
by respective memberships of the exchanges, would result in a
single trading and order delivery system, the statement said.
   A Board of Trade spokesman said the exchange had no further
comment on the announcement.
   A call to Leo Melamed, chairman of the executive committee of
the Mercantile Exchange, was not immediately returned Friday.
   London-based Reuters Holdings PLC, which disseminates financial
news and market information and is providing the technical
expertise for Globex, is ``absolutely delighted with the
announcment,'' it said in a separate statement.
   ``We look forward to working closely with both exchanges as
their discussions progress,'' said Andre Villeneuve, president of
Reuters America Inc., the U.S. holding company for Reuters.
   The Merc's original plans called for Globex to be operating by
summer. Its aim is to link investors in North America, Europe and
Asia through an electronic system for trading futures and options
contracts on currency futures, including the British pound, the
West German mark, the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen and Eurodollar
time deposits.
   The system would operate during hours when the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange's trading floor in Chicago is closed.
   Similarly, the Board of Trade's Aurora system, originally
planned to begin operating in the fall, would be activated after
the close of daytime trading hours on the Chicago exchange floor.
   The Aurora system will handle only trading on financial futures
and futures options, said the CBOT spokesman, who asked not to be
identified.
   Futures and options allow investors to speculate on the future
performance of commodities and financial instruments.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Friday in sluggish trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, as
activity was muted by uncertainty over the weather and by the
impending Memorial Day weekend.
   On other markets, energy futures were higher, precious metals
were lower and livestock and meat prices were down.
   Soybean futures were mixed, with the July contract higher on
reports of heavy trading in Europe of soybean oil and soybean meal.
   ``There is some talk that a number of countries will be
purchasing soybean oil and soybean meal, including the Soviet
Union,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc.
in Chicago.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.93{ a bushel; corn was { cent to 4 cents
lower with July at $2.64\ a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 3{ cents
lower with July at $1.70 a bushel; soybeans were 13 cents lower to
9{ cents higher with July at $7.11 a bushel.
   Uncertainty over the weather put a damper on most of the market.
National Weather Service forecasts for next week call for average
or above-average rain for major crop-producing states.
   Corn futures were boosted slightly by heavy rains Thursday in
Ohio and Indiana. The rain could further delay the planting of corn
crops in those states.
   Wheat futures were lower, despite an upswing in exports and
reports the Soviets were in the market for spring and red winter
wheat.
   After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department announced
the sale to the Soviet Union of 200,000 metric tons of wheat under
its export bonus program.
   Energy futures were higher in quiet trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Analysts say the market has settled into a
narrow trading range as next month's meeting in Vienna of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries approaches.
   OPEC members are to decide on production quotas for the second
half of the year and whether to change the benchmark price for its
oil, now at $18 a barrel.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 4 cents to 18 cents higher
with July at $19.52 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent to .87 cent
higher with June at 49.20 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .23
cent lower to .33 cent higher with June at 66.39 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures were lower in sluggish trading on New
York's Commodity Exchange.
   Prices rose modestly at the start of trading, but as the dollar
renewed its rise, gold and silver futures began to fall as investor
took profits from the previous two days' advances, said Peter
Cardillo, an analyst with Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York.
   Gold was $1 to $1.40 lower with June at $365.90 a troy ounce;
silver was 1.3 cents lower with July at $5.305 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and pork futures mostly were lower in light trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle were lower on a non-existing cash market and expectations
of lower prices next week, said Dale Benson, an analyst for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Hog prices declined because of slackening demand and large
numbers of pork bellies in cold storage.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .48 cent lower with June at 68.77
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .50 cent lower with
August at 77.22 a pound; hogs were .15 cent to 1.15 cents lower
with June at 47.60 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .50 cent
to 1.17 cents lower with July at 31.07 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Targeting Japan For Unfair Trade Could Hurt More than Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush may say he justifiably punished
Japan by formally branding it an unfair trading partner, but
critics say he actually may have lobbed an economic boomerang
against the financially powerful Japanese.
   The result, they say, could smack the United States from behind
with a drastic drop in Japanese investment in this country, which
at its worst could force a sharp runup in interest rates and cost
many jobs, two key ingredients for a recession.
   Even Michael Boskin, the president's chief economic adviser,
counseled against targeting Japan. Boskin has said publicly that
American efforts to punish trading partners could incite acute
worldwide economic problems.
   Bush named Japan, along with India and Brazil, for what he
described as persistently unfair practices that deny foreign access
to their markets in businesses that range from supercomputers to to
satellites to insurance.
   He took the action this past week under a provision of the 1988
trade law that requires the White House to compile what amounts to
a target list of countries with barriers to American exporters.
   The law requires the United States to impose up to 100 percent
tariffs on goods from those countries if negotiations to erase the
barriers fail.
   Bush said his goal was to force the three countries to ``to work
constructively with us to resolve these issues expeditiously.'' But
the immediate reaction was to provoke outrage from the target
countries.
   The most significant response came from Japan, which threatened
to take the United States to international trade court and hinted
at other possible retaliation for what the Japanese called an
``extremely regrettable'' decision.
   Exactly how Tokyo would respond remained unclear by the end of
the week. But by many measures the Japanese have amassed enormous
influence in the American economy, so any countermeasures could
have potential severity, opponents of trade sanctions argue.
   Japanese products accounted for 44 percent of the $119.8 billion
U.S. trade deficit last year. Japanese purchases of U.S. real
estate have helped buoy property values in such cities as New York
and Los Angeles. Many Japanese companies now assemble products in
the United States. Japan buys billions of dollars worth of U.S.
government bonds, crucial to financing the federal budget deficit.
   Abrupt tariff-related price hikes for imported Japanese
computers, cars, televisions or videocassette recorders would
create some pain in the United States. But if Japanese investors
shed large holdings of U.S. securities, the consequences could be
much more profound.
   In a worst-case scenario, for example, Japanese sales of U.S.
stocks could douse Wall Street's market's widely touted revival.
Without Japanese purchases of Treasury bonds, the government would
be forced to raise interest rates to attract investors, driving up
rates in the credit markets and making it harder for American
consumers and businesses to borrow money.
   The ripple effect could range from mortgage defaults and
business bankruptcies to a drop in consumer spending, forcing
companies to cut production and lay off employees. A surge in idled
workers could cause another round of loan defaults and decline in
consumer spending and the cycle would start again.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _More evidence emerged that the economy is slowing but may not
skid into a recession. The government revised its first-quarter
economic growth estimate to 4.3 percent from 5.5 percent, while
durable goods orders rose 2.9 percent in April and personal income
rose 1.1 percent, suggesting underlying strength.
   _The U.S. dollar took investors on an adventurous ride, surging
early in the week to some of the highest levels in two years for
reasons that ranged sheer speculation to political turmoil abroad.
But by the end of the week new skepticism about the dollar emerged
on speculation that key U.S. trading partners would raise interest
rates to make their currencies more valuable.
   _Donald Trump triumphed in a bidding war for the Eastern
Airlines lucrative Northeast shuttle with a $365 million offer, but
the fate of the rest of the airline remained uncertain after nearly
three months of a crippling strike and bankruptcy-court maneuvering.

   Bond prices advanced Friday, recovering from an
early decline on the strength of the dollar and signs that
inflation might be moderating.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond rose 11-16 point, or nearly $7
for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from price, declined to 8.61 percent from 8.67
percent late Thursday.
   Trading was described as thin in advance of the Memorial Day
holiday weekend, and the markets closed earlier than usual.
   Prices began the day on the down side after the government
reported consumer spending shot up 1.1 percent in April, the
biggest advance in nearly a year. The spending data fueled the
market's fears of inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income
investments such as bonds.
   But bond prices later recovered as traders examined personal
income figures released by the government, said Maury Harris, chief
economist with PaineWebber Inc.
   The Commerce Department said personal income rose a weak 0.4
percent last month compared with hikes of 0.8 percent in March and
1 percent in February. The April figure was lower than the market
expectations of a 0.7 percent increase, Harris said.
   The better-than-expected report gave traders hope that the
inflation rate might be slowing.
   The dollar was mixed against other currencies, but showed signs
of defying central banks' attempts to drive it lower. Its
resilience carried over to the bond market, analysts said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues were up [ point to 5-32 point,
intermediate maturities gained 9-32 point to 11-32 point and
long-term issues advanced { point, according to figures provided by
Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.32 to 1,151.87.
   In corporate trading, industrial bonds rose. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, picked up 0.11 to close at 313.69.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was unchanged. The average yield to maturity
edged down to 7.45 percent from 7.46 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, declined to
9.02 percent as the discount fell 5 basis points to 8.52 percent.
Yields on six-month bills slipped to 9.10 percent as the discount
fell 9 basis points to 8.43 percent. Yields on one-year bills
declined to 8.90 percent as the discount lost 6 basis points to
8.26 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 911-16 percent, down from 913-16 percent late
Thursday.

<TEXT>
   National Steel Corp. and the United
Steelworkers said Friday they'd tentatively agreed on a 50-month
contract that restores pay cuts and matches wage gains won by the
union at Bethlehem Steel Corp.
   The National settlement is the second among four major producers
that faced expiring contracts July 31. It was approved by local
presidents on the union negotiating committee late Thursday, the
same day union members ratified the Bethlehem contract.
   National had been expected to tailor its agreement to the
Bethlehem settlement even though National's profits per ton of
steel are the lowest among the major U.S. producers.
   ``This agreement looks both forward and backward,'' Buddy Davis,
the union's chief negotiator, and negotiating secretary Harry
Lester said in a statement. ``It recognizes that our members have
not had a wage increase since 1982 and that they have made
significant sacrifices to help the company return to
profitability.''
   The contract, effective June 1, covers 7,300 union members at
the three plants operated by the nation's sixth-largest steelmaker,
St. Louis, Portage, Ind., and Ecorse, Mich.
   It restores wage sacrifices made in 1986, raising average base
wages by $1.81 per hour to $13.69 by the time it expires in July
1993, said union spokesman Gary Hubbard.
   By a margin of nearly 4-1, union members Thursday ratified a
50-month package with No. 2 Bethlehem that raises average base
wages by $2.50 per hour to $13.72 by July 1993.
   National employees will get a $500 payment in recognition of
past concessions and a $500 cash advance on profit-sharing for
1989. Pension and medical benefits also will be improved, and new
training programs will be offered.
   ``From a practical standpoint, I don't think they could have
given less, because there hasn't been a wage increase since 1982,''
said steel analyst Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets. ``This looks about in line with inflation. The only
problem is the steel prices aren't going up along with inflation.''

   Oil futures prices finished mostly higher Friday
in quiet trading in advance of the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, ended at
$19.52 a 42-gallon barrel, up 4 cents.
   Prices of crude contracts for delivery after July also rose.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale home
heating oil for delivery in June edged up 0.15 cent to 49.20 cents
a gallon. Contracts for the other delivery months jumped more than
0.80 cent a gallon.
   The June contract for unleaded gasoline fell 0.22 cent to 66.39
cents a gallon. Most other months rose, however.
   Analysts said there were no fresh factors influencing prices,
and most of the movements resulted from oil traders balancing their
positions in advance of the holiday weekend.
   ``Not a whimper, not a whisper,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant
director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.
   Traders continue to speculate about the outcome of an OPEC
meeting scheduled for next month, Beutel said.
   In recent days, buyers have been reluctant to accumulate
significant holdings ahead of the meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries that is set to begin in Vienna,
Austria, on June 5.
   There has been speculation that the 13-nation cartel may decide
to boost production limits.

<HEAD>Apple To Launch Big Marketing Campaign For Macintosh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an effort to win corporate
customers, Apple Computer Inc. next week plans to launch its
largest marketing campaign since the introduction of the Macintosh
computer five years ago.
   The campaign uses an animation of a flying car to show off the
Mac's capabilities and try to woo corporate customers, especially
those in marketing, sales and advertising.
   The cost of the promotion _ including television and print
advertisements and interactive in-store displays _ will be about
$50 million, according to a published report Thursday in the San
Francisco Chronicle.
   In a break from earlier Mac advertisements, the new campaign
stresses specific ways to use the computer. The ads, created by
BBDO-Los Angeles, show how the computer can produce or display
drawings, slides, specifications and financial data.
   ``It's one thing to have a great idea, but it's no good unless
you can sell it,'' said James Yaffe, vice president and account
supervisor at BBDO-Los Angeles. ``These ads show ways people use
Apple desktop media to communicate and sell an idea.''
   New to the campaign is the phrase ``Apple desktop media,'' which
is intended to emphasize the many facets of the Mac. Apple,
however, will retain the slogan used in previous campaigns, ``The
Power to Be Your Best.''
   Nearly all materials employed for the campaign, from ads to
brochures, were created using the Macintosh.
   ``That's important because we want to sell the Mac to people who
want to make brochures with the Mac,'' said an Apple spokeswoman.
``We want to position the Mac at this point as the idea machine to
communicate with.''
   The biggest ad push by Apple _ before its current campaign _
began on Super Bowl Sunday 1984 with the landmark ``1984'' ads that
showed a nightmarish vision of author George Orwell's ``1984,''
pitting a young woman against Big Brother and a room of drone-like
workers.
   Apple's stock hit a 52-week high Thursday, up 50 cents at $48.50
in active over-the-counter trading.

<HEAD>Nintendo Sues Atari Over Soviet Video Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese video game maker Nintendo on
Thursday sued Atari Games Corp. over the rights to Tetris, the
first Soviet video game available in the West.
   Nintendo of America Inc., a subsidiary of Nintendo Co., filed a
countersuit in federal court in San Francisco charging Atari and
its subsidiary Tengen Inc. of Milpitas, Calif., of infringing on
the rights to the Soviet game.
   The court action seeks to enforce Nintendo's rights and those of
ELORG, a Soviet government agency that licensed Nintendo to
distribute Tetris for home video use in the United States.
   In Tetris, players manipulate rapidly falling geometric shapes
to form solid horizontal lines. The game has been compared in
simplicity and difficulty to Rubik's cube.
   Atari Games is no longer related to Nintendo's main U.S.
competitor, Atari Corp.
   In a suit against Nintendo in April, Tengen claimed ownership of
exclusive rights to sell Tetris and charged that Nintendo was
trying to drive the company out of the market for
Nintendo-compatible video games.
   Nintendo has an 80 percent share of the U.S. home video game
market.
   Bill White, a spokesman for Nintendo of America in this Seattle
suburb, said U.S. District Judge Vern Smith on Thursday denied a
motion for a preliminary injunction against Atari and Tengen.
   At the same time, White said, the judge denied Tengen's motion
to dismiss the suit and scheduled a June 15 hearing.
   In another decision Thursday, Smith rejected motions by Atari
Games and Tengen to dismiss Nintendo's claims of trademark
infringement and patent infringement in earlier legal action.
   Tengen has introduced a Tetris cartridge for use on Nintendo
systems, claiming rights from the Soviets through sublicenses
covering personal computers. The Tengen version has sold 100,000
copies.
   Tengen and Nintendo split late last year when Tengen filed an
antitrust suit accusing Nintendo of monopolizing the U.S. market
for cartridges that run on the Nintendo home video game system.
